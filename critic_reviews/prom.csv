This new Disney confection cuts to the chase by hooking the whole plot around the prom plans of earnest straight-laced Nova (Aimee Teegarden). Nova believes that prom is an essential ritual for students before graduation and is devastated when her decorations go up in smoke. With the rest of the prom committee mysteriously busy she must accept the help of rebellious Jesse (Thomas McDonell) whos been ordered to assist by the disapproving principal.Jesse is a long-haired rebel in a black leather jacket straight from the Judd Nelson school although played by McDonell he boasts an eerie resemblance to Johnny Depp. His anti-prom sneering is fairly mild but it brings welcome relief from the wide-eyed innocence displayed by Nova who happens to be without a prom date (and this one of the prettiest girls in school). Their love match is inevitable but young impressionable minds should still find it romantic if only because of McDonells charms.Elsewhere the story plays out like a U-rated episode of Gossip Girl the school jock has been playing away the clever couple consider going to separate universities the geek tries to get the girl the gangly guy seeks a date with anyone. Occasionally its mildly amusing but the conclusions are so soft it hurts. Still if youre a parent hoping to convince your child that teenagers dont drink smoke swear have sex or take drugs this is for you.

At area theaters. ""Prom"" is the kind of tween-targeted come-on that could have a fan of ""Glee"" -- a Gleek -- questioning her fondness for teen fodder. Almost. Whatever authentic adolescent anxieties and hankerings resentments and affections the Fox TV show gets right those remain untapped in this slight high-school flick from the Disney assembly line. ""Prom"" insists on a premise sure to have some in the audience coughing an expletive. To wit The annual spring gathering is the most important event behind (ahead of?) graduation in the book of high-school memories. And prom unites all those lunchroom coteries under one disco ball. Cough. Brookside High class prez Nova Prescott believes this with her all her overachieving heart and wants to make this years event the BEST PROM EVER When the dances decorations are destroyed -- in an act that never gets mentioned again -- the pert otherwise impressively sane Nova (Aimee Teegarden) is saddled with an unsympathetic helper to make things right. Dreamy newcomer Thomas McDonell plays Jesse Richter a sad-bad boy with a motorcycle and a suit of emotional armor. If youve guessed whats coming who are we to get in your way? Except for a couple of nice touches ""Prom"" is a remedial class in cliches. A fine exception comes when presumptive prom queen Jordan (Kylie Bunbury) begins removing the photos of her and boyfriend Tyler (DeVaughn Nixon) that crowd her bedroom mirror. What shes left with provides one of the films more affirming moments. The best thing ""Prom"" has going for it is a clique of appealing performers. Among them Joe Adler as Rolo a blissed-out guy wonderfully comfortable with his seeming cluelessness. Nicholas Braun and Raini Rodriguez have pleasing chemistry as Lloyd and Tess a socially awkward senior and his bolder wiser younger sis. Recently a colleague told us about a senior fella asking her daughter an awesome junior to prom by writing the proposition on the driveway. ""Aww"" was our response. When this same clever thing happens again and again in ""Prom"" ugh is more like it. Heres something studios forget too often Branding of sweetness soon becomes saccharine.

Cant A Guy Ask A Girl To Prom? Credit Walt Disney Pictures From the Walt Disney Companys wholesome-produce department the pleasantly retro teen movie Prom comes bearing no offense. Which is nice for parents seeking healthy alternatives to say Glee or worse Pretty Little Liars -- if slightly worrying to those of us who grew up on the necessity of youthful rebellion. Directed by Joe Nussbaum (Sleepover) from a chipper screenplay by Katie Wech Prom is a good-hearted perfectly watchable bonbon about adolescents with little on their minds besides who will ask or be asked to the graduation night shindig. Nussbaum has claimed a cinematic affinity with John Hughes but Proms sensibility is less Ferris Buellers Day Off than pale Pretty in Pink updated with a perky High School Musical vibe. (Though minus the hoofing; instead theres a broadly winking soundtrack featuring Those Dancing Days and Simple Plan.) By way of technique a split screen here and there helps set up the few personality traits shared by all 14 members of the ensemble -- dewy novice actors so blandly photogenic that they all look vaguely familiar. At the center of this tray of sweets which includes the usual fly boy several shy boys a high-flying Asian girl and a dignified African-American prom queen is a developing romance between a good girl who needs to let her hair down and a bad boy who needs to cut his -- I mean who needs to straighten up. The rub is she has no yin and hes woefully short on yang. An obsessive event planner Nova (played by Friday Night Lights Aimee Teegarden she of the ski-slope nose and Sally Field cheeks) is Elections Tracy Flick but minus the satire -- indeed minus almost everything but her straight-arrow niceness. As for Jesse (Thomas McDonell) his reprobate credentials stop at a Johnny Depp do a flash or two of temper tantrum and a poor attitude toward prom prep. From the first meet cute Jesse wears a placard (loves his family good at repairs) marked Working-Class Prince Potential. i Jordan (Kylie Bunbury left) and Tyler (DeVaughn Nixon) the favorites to be named prom queen and king are stuck mending their relationship before they can don their crowns. Richard Foreman Jr./Walt Disney Pictures hide caption toggle caption Richard Foreman Jr./Walt Disney Pictures Jordan (Kylie Bunbury left) and Tyler (DeVaughn Nixon) the favorites to be named prom queen and king are stuck mending their relationship before they can don their crowns. Richard Foreman Jr./Walt Disney Pictures Forget freaks; even geeks are thin on the ground in Prom. On the plus side theres not a Bieber clone in the bunch. But neither is there a flannel-shirted Juno a purple-haired nose-ringed best friend or even a crusading Clueless shopaholic to pep up the obligatory dress-shopping sequence and challenge the high-school pecking order. None of this vanilla crew you can be sure will ever end up in the Juno predicament The only hint of sex in Prom is a broken fountain that overflows when it -- and the meager plot -- gets repaired. As a parent I gave thanks. As a moviegoer raised on the youth revolt and a critic with no great love for facile uplift I hungered for some mutinous push-back against the movies watery 50s aspirations. The only remotely ground-breaking thing about Prom is its casual color-blindness. Well not blindness exactly. Along with the ubiquitous caramel skin -- you cant tell which race(s) many of these kids belong to and its no big deal to them or the filmmakers -- Nussbaum and Wech have made so bold as to introduce an African-American bad boy (DeVaughn Nixon) whose poor character has nothing whatever to do with his race. Good for them -- and for every black actor whos had it with playing inner-city badass or saintly crusader for inter-ethnic tolerance.

""Play it Sam."" ""You talkin to me?"" ""Ill be baaaack."" Prom has nothing like that. Instead it has this sparkling piece of idiocy spoken by bad boy Jesse (Thomas McDonell) to good girl Nova (Aimee Teegarden) while the pair are bickering over life and love and party decorations. Theyre setting up for prom. Nova has asked Jesse to ""check the speed of the disco ball"" which sorry he simply cant do without a sarcastic little flick of the wrist. Then she makes the dire error of referring to the two them as ""us"" never a good idea in class-conscious teen romances especially when one of them wears leather and roars about town on a motorcycle. Jesse going for the bait glowers mightily at this perky pretty party-planner before him and says ""What us? Your world may be all disco balls and celestial fountains but thats not where I live"" Oh man -- thats a low blow. Hes dissing the fountain Novas bedazzled centerpiece in her plans for the bestest prom in the history of proms. See Jesse is forced to help her because he annoys the school principal (Jere Burns) and because he needs an excuse to strip to his undershirt and haul around fabric rolls while Nova ogles him through her bangs. Meanwhile the rest of the male student population agonizes over how and when to ask whom to the big dance (for whatever reasons gals cant pop the question themselves). Some movies are bad some movies are good some are in-betweeny and inoffensive and harm absolutely no one. Prom is one of those. Its a film about high school set during a period of dangerous hormonal urges and surges and it climaxes (eep) at the one event most often associated with unchained adolescent saturnalia and pigs blood. But this is neither American Pie nor Carrie; this is Prom. Its Disney. Its rated PG (""for mild language and a brief fight"") it showcases lots of dainty closed-mouthed kissing - and its nice. Im glad its billed as a comedy because I did laugh quite a bit. Not necessarily when I was supposed to but why pick nits? Writer Katie Wech and director Joe Nussbaum (who made the Snow White update Sydney White) do a much better job with Proms gazillion supporting characters than with the Jesse-and-Nova show which doesnt devolve into cliches so much as string them with lights and twirl under them. Theyre a ridiculously cute pair and ridiculously at odds over this whole prom thingy which is by its very nature ridiculous. So the ridiculous quotient is extremely high. Yet some of the humor functions as intended. A couple of subplots are sweet. Joe Adlers performance as an airhead who claims to have a girlfriend named Athena is effortlessly amusingly weird and there are likable digs at student driving the desperate date quest and Ethan Frome not bad for a well-intentioned flick about well-intentioned kids who worry too much about disco balls. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Bass Pro Shops Clearance Sale Deals from 1 + free shipping w/...

And I hold the actors largely blameless for this effort as they are game for varying degrees of perkiness followed by gloom which is immediately followed by perkiness. Ah yes the vagaries of the teenage mind. So solid actors and some nice tunes whats not to like? Sadly plenty. The writing and direction are my main concerns here -- a crushingly average movie has been produced because the story lacks large amounts of both crucial factors. Prom somehow comes off as shallow though it has about a dozen characters and meaningless though its about the most ""meaningful"" day in a teens life. Strange. Prom begins three weeks before prom at Brookside High in Michigan. Nova class president and all-around supergirl is hard at work on the prom decorations. Shes decided to go with a ""Starry Night"" theme clearly unaware that Van Gogh modeled the painting on the view outside his sanitarium room window. Or perhaps thats an apt metaphor for what awaits for the next 108 minutes around 90 minutes too long as characters flail about searching for anything resembling momentum. A minor case of accidental arson occurs leaving Nova without decorations and the prom theme is in doubt. Will it all come together? Will everyone find happiness? Ill leave you to your predictions. All of the high school archetypes are present as brought down from the mountain by John Hughes. The nerd the rebel the popular (though vapid) jock and the overachiever who just wants a boyfriend. The introduction of each of these poor souls is clumsy and telegraphed. How do you know the rebel is rebellious? He rides a bike Hes got black fingerless gloves on How do you know the nerd cant get a date to prom? Hes named Lloyd And so on. Still all of the actors approach the thankless task with verve and Im certain well see a few of them go on to prominence. I particularly liked the work of Janelle Ortiz as Ali her scenes came off as stylish and subtle with more than couple laughs. And Aimee Teegarden (as Nova Prescott) oozed likability if only the dastardly machinations on the screen hadnt done her in. Of course everyone has a problem. Novas best friend wont ask her to prom though she keeps dropping hints. The jock might be cheating on his girlfriend. A sophomore boy desperately wants to ask his lab partner to prom. The rebel is figuring out how to be a man in the absence of his father who evidently exited stage left leaving the rebel and his mom to work overtime to support the family. Ah yes the lovely world of Disney where the ""bad guy"" is always simply misunderstood and not just a psychopath. The rebel and Nova are the main characters here but plenty of other folks get scenes too. To the films detriment it cant build up much in the way of momentum for Nova and never have the stakes seemed so low for everyone involved. This is a sterile high school environment lacking anything nearing controversy. If youre looking for a couple of light laughs and some new bands to listen to then Prom might just fit the bill. If youre looking for a great and memorable film? Save that corsage for another day.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 29 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Apr. 28 2011 305PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Back in the bad old days of Carrie prom night was a horror show that spilled buckets of blood and climaxed in a hellish conflagration. As high-school metaphors go you could do worse. But ours is a more benign bully-resistant zero-tolerance age and Prom is its poster child. In short this is a Disney flick complete with an ensemble of Mouseketeers doing their level best to be the Muzak of kids - any resemblance to an actual teenager is purely accidental. So to say its really lame is to belabour the obvious. More interestingly its also kind of sweet in a contrived and fumbling first-kiss sort of way - different times apparently demand different metaphors. Movies Prom The official trailer The stereotypes get trotted out immediately all spruced up and smiley-faced and guaranteed to make a John Hughes picture look like brutal realism. First theres Nova (Aimee Teegarden) the summa cum laude of Disney teens - blonde pert straight-A student head of the prom committee and sufficiently well-endowed to pretty near out-Funicello Annette. On to Jesse (Thomas McDonell) but dont be fooled by his long hair and motorcycle and delinquent pose. Turns out the lad is a rebel with a cause hailing from the wrong side of the tracks yet positioned at the right hand of God from which stance he works after hours to help his single mom and care for his little bro. Tyler the hunky jock is a shoo-in for prom king although maybe just a little too popular with the girls. I think hes supposed to be the two-timing villain of the piece but in the blinding glare of his constant megawatt smile its hard to be sure. Oh there are more - like the cute sophomores of both genders who keep vying to mingle with the seniors or like Lloyd the loveable loser forever striking out in the dating game. Theres even a like totally laid-back dude whod be the resident stoner in any high-school movie that recognized the on-campus existence of (dare I say?) recreational drugs. Here of course hes just Rolo the really happy guy. The devastating plot twist? Darned if all the stars made for the proms Starry Night theme - the cardboard ones so many students toiled so many hours to hand-cut and paint - dont burn up when the storage shed bursts into flames. As conflagrations go it falls short of hellish standards but at least brings Nova the perfect gal into the company of Jesse the good bad boy. Together they work to fix the calamity and in the process discover that first impressions can be misleading and quick judgments dead wrong. Well in that same spirit lets not be hasty in our condemnations here - lets be slow and considerate in our condemnations here. Oops that cynical gene again - down with it up with kids. In fact this is an education in the new grammar. For example in keeping with todays penchant for turning respectable verbs into sexy nouns guys no longer ask girls to the prom but sally forth on an ""ask."" To his great credit director Joe Nussbaum treats us to a whole montage of asks. Speaking of which dont underestimate the merit of the ""Lets go dress shopping"" montage where we and Nova learn a valuable lesson in Walt Disney mathematics - specifically the permissible ratio of cleavage to frock. Another edifying detail Seems that a prom is actually a unifying force that ""one night has a way of bringing us together."" Whats more under the cardboard stars the dazed-and-confused suddenly crystallize into the happy-and-clear-headed a transformation whose only required catalyst is a ton or two of artificial sweeteners. I cant vouch for Prom as a movie but its a hell of a chemistry class.

Starring Aimee Teegarden Thomas McDonell Danielle Campbell Yin Chang Kylie Bunbury Nicholas Braun Jared Kusnitz Jonathan Keltz DeVaughn Nixon Nolan Sotillo Director Joe Nussbaum Running time 143 Release Opened Apr 29 2011  Editorial Review As plot goes its Mickey Mouse By Sandie Angulo ChenWednesday April 27 2011 For movie lovers prom evokes cinematic memories of pigs blood in buckets virginity-losing contests and ""Pygmalion""-style makeovers. Youll find none of those things in ""Prom"" Disneys chaste take on the annual high school spectacular. Nor will you find much excitement tension or resemblance to actual teen culture in this whitewash of the quintessential rite of passage. Director Joe Nussbaums story follows Georgetown-bound class president Nova Prescott (Aimee Teegarden fresh off her role in ""Scream 4"") as she plans her schools ""Starry Night"" bash. In her opening voice-over Prescott describes prom as the one perfect night that unites all high school seniors regardless of their social standing the past four years. In the 20 minutes that follow this idealistic and unrealistic appraisal guys devise increasingly theatrical invitations to the big night ""PROM?"" the guys ask -- with sidewalk chalk window signs stage lights and chest paint. Despite all that Novas date hunky but sensible valedictorian Brandon merely asks Nova to ""carpool"" and hands her a ticket. Already reeling from her slug-line treatment Nova faces another early tragedy when all of the prom decorations catch fire three weeks before the big night (the closest this pic gets to the prom-night catastrophe of ""Carrie""). To save the party Principal Dunnan (Jere Burns) orders Jesse Richter (Thomas McDonell) a motorcycle-riding truant to help Nova rebuild everything in order to graduate. Shes a conformist overachiever hes a troubled soul; a third-grader could tell that the two will fall hard for each other by the movies halfway point. When this teen drama hits Disneys cable network as it inevitably will the studios basic-cable censors will have absolutely nothing to cut and thats the problem. A pure-and-clean prom movie is perfectly fine for a television special like the original ""High School Musical"" but in a feature film it plays as shockingly inauthentic. In ""Prom"" none of the kisses are swoon-worthy (on the big screen a foot of space between kissing teens is laughably noticeable) and all the infidelities are insignificant. After Tyler (DeVaughn Nixon) the dreamy lacrosse captain secretly dates a pretty sophomore scorned girlfriend Jordan (Kylie Bunbury) doesnt shed one tear; she just dumps him the week before prom and robotically takes down all the pictures of him in her room. Even Lloyd (Nicholas Braun) the one senior who threatens to upset the pro-prom premise by failing to find a date comes off as charmingly witty and winds up taking his younger step-sister. The Bad Boy in ""Prom"" isnt even a bad boy. Jesse looks the part with his brooding eyes and floppy hair reminiscent of Heath Ledgers breakout performance in ""10 Things I Hate About You"" but hes actually a devoted son to a working-class single mom. The real reason he ditches last period is to pick up his kid brother from elementary school. When Novas dad warns Jesse to leave his good girl alone youve got to wonder how he wouldve reacted if someone genuinely edgy (say Judd Nelsons John Bender from ""The Breakfast Club"") had shown up with his pack of smokes instead of a candy necklace in his pocket. In ""Prom"" everyones perfectly multicultural but no ones unattractive angsty subversive or an outcast. Nobody curses texts or talks about sex (much less plans to have it). Obviously not every teen movie needs to be a raunchy drug-filled cautionary tale to be believable but this movie fails to acknowledge that 18-year-olds behave any differently from 11-year-olds at their fifth-grade dance. As a result tweens might make the ideal audience because anyone old enough to attend or remember a prom will have trouble not laughing aloud. If theres a middle way of depicting teen romance thats neither as crude as ""American Pie"" nor as tame as Disney Channel fodder ""Prom"" missed it. Contains a brief fistfight.

Disneys ""Prom"" presents a squeaky- clean picture of high school that possibly only an 8-year-old could identify with. Although some parents will doubtless take comfort in its fantasy of an academic institution where sex drugs and gay teenagers dont exist. Its almost surreal that this ultra-predictable star-free variation on the ""American Graffiti"" formula would be offered up to the moviegoing public a quarter century after the films of John Hughes introduced a semblance of realism into the genre. ""Prom"" is so strenuously inoffensive it makes Disneys ""High School Musical"" look almost racy by comparison. Yes theres a long-haired rebellious Bad Boy (Thomas McDonell) with a motorcycle but Marlon Brando hes not. The worst thing we see him do is sneak into another high school at night with The Good Girl (Aimee Teegarden of TVs ""Friday Night Lights"") . . . to check out their prom decorations. Talk about transgressive The Bad Boy has been assigned to reluctantly help The Good Girl (a k a the class president) after the prom decorations are destroyed in an accidental fire. The Good Girls father doesnt want her hanging out with The Bad Boy but of course hes just misunderstood. Another mini-drama concerns The Jock (DeVaughn Nixon) who is dumped by his Long-Suffering Girlfriend (Kylie Bunbury) when she realizes hes a player. So The Jock hooks up -- in an entirely chaste way of course -- with Another Sweet Girl (Danielle Campbell) who The Nerd (Nolan Sotillo) has been ardently hoping will accompany him to the celebration. And then theres The Girl Who Got Into Parsons (Yin Chang) but is afraid to tell The Boyfriend Who Wants To Get Engaged (Jared Kusnitz). The only one of those stereotypes I much care for was The Shy Romantic Who Keeps Getting Turned Down by Prospective Dates. Nicholas Braun who plays him would remind me a lot of a young John Cusack even if the character werent named after one of Cusacks long-ago characters (Lloyd from ""Say Anything""). As you may have guessed there isnt anything terribly original in the allegedly autobiographical script credited to newcomer Katie Wech who seems to have collaborated with a screenwriting computer program. The whole thing is directed with painless efficiency by Joe Nussbaum whose rap sheet includes the direct-to-video ""American Pie Presents the Naked Mile."" You can imagine the jokes he was trading with director of cinematography Byron Shah who shot ""An American Crime"" -- the one where Catherine Keener used Ellen Page as a human ashtray. OK so obviously I may not be the ideal audience. My high school in Astoria Queens didnt even have a prom. You want ""Prom"" youve got it. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Mad Men star January Jones expecting first child but da...

(Richard Foreman/AP) Joe Neumaier Friday April 29 2011 400 AM Title Prom review A bit clumsy a little dewy painfully unaware of whats best left unsaid -- thats not just teenagers on the cusp of adulthood thats also ""Prom."" And it results in a movie thats so anachronistically mushy and awkward it earns extra credit simply for being so innocent.Aimee Teegarden (""Friday Night Lights"") is Nova whos ending high school as class valedictorian and head of the prom committee before leaving her small Michigan town and heading to an East Coast college. Her pal Mei (Yin Chang) will be studying at Pratt in New York although Meis boyfriend Justin (Jared Kusnitz) doesnt know that.Meanwhile football player Tyler (DeVaughn Nixon) messes up his prom plans with Jordan (Kylie Bunbury) by dallying with a cute sophomore (Danielle Campbell).And tall goofus Lloyd (Nicholas Braun) is searching high and low for any girl to bring to the Big Event.But amongst all the appreciation for bittersweet youth the movies big preoccupation is Will Nova have a date for the prom shes in charge of salvaging after the decorations are burned in a fire? If you dont think school rebel Jesse (Thomas McDonell) will show up and sweep her off her feet youre unaware of any youth culture from the last 60 years.Director Joe Nussbaum in fact seems to have overshot his aim for gentle Americana and landed smack-dab in Thornton Wilders ""Our Town""; barely any kids even text in this film. Yet will the intended audience the ones going through the same issues as the characters care about its cliches?Nope and theres a beauty in that. Written like a Hallmark card and so so earnestly executed ""Prom"" is filled with too much teen-flick pomp -- unless of course youre the same age as its freaks geeks basket cases and princesses. In that case jump in and go. And dont let your heart die when you grow up.

Credit Richard Foreman Jr./Walt Disney Pictures Some moviegoers and critics will probably dismiss ""Prom"" as just another predictable offering from the Disney formula factory. Which is precisely what it is. But heres the thing There are new tweeners every year. To them the characters and plot devices in this perfectly competent film might well seem fresh.Aimee Teegarden of ""Friday Night Lights"" is Nova a serious high school student who is particularly serious about the prom shes its main organizer and wants everything to be perfect. Shed also like a date to it but the guy she has in mind a bland fellow do-gooder doesnt get the concept.Happily though fate is unkind to the shed containing the prom decorations -- is that a ""Carrie"" homage tucked into a Disney film? -- and she has to rebuild them quickly with the help of the school bad boy Jesse (Thomas McDonell). You know whats going to happen.But your children might not. Lots of side plots about whos going to ask whom to the big event propel things along with Nicholas Braun making the best comic contributions as a hapless senior who has waited too long to snag a date. Anyway in the end tuxedos are rented connections are made and of course lessons are learned.""Prom"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) but is utterly harmless.PROMOpens on Friday nationwide.

By Richard Foreman Jr. Disney Enterprises Unlikely couple Jesse (Thomas McDonell) and Nova (Aimee Teegarden) fall for each other after being forced to work on prom together. EnlargeClose By Richard Foreman Jr. Disney Enterprises Unlikely couple Jesse (Thomas McDonell) and Nova (Aimee Teegarden) fall for each other after being forced to work on prom together. Heres a by-the-playbook movie if ever there was one. The machinations leading up to the big night are hardly worth the fuss Proms entertainment quotient comes up deficient. Familiar stories leading up to the big dance intersect clumsily. Nova (Aimee Teegarden) the over-achieving head of the prom committee cant stand Jesse (Thomas McDonell) the long-haired bad boy who cuts class and zips around on a motorcycle. He scoffs at her beloved high school rituals. But wise Principal Dunnan (Jere Burns) throws them together to work on prom decorations. Though outwardly surly Jesse is actually a softy whos devoted to his little brother and hardworking mom. Anyone whos made it past fifth grade can figure out that Nova and Jesse will end up together. Along the way audiences must slog through a hackneyed prom-dress modeling montage and an inane spy mission to a school with the same prom theme. The ensemble also includes jock Tyler (DeVaughn Nixon) who goes out with the equally popular girl Jordan (Kylie Bunbury) but fools around behind her back. Mei (Yin Chang) agonizes over telling her sweetly nerdy boyfriend Justin (Jared Kusnitz) that she got into design school and wont be going to college with him. These ordinary problems are blown up into melodrama with excruciatingly leaden dialogue. About the movie Prom 1/2 out of fourStars Aimee Teegarden Thomas McDonell DeVaughn Nixon Yin Chang Raini Rodriguez Dean Norris Faith FordDirector Joe NussbaumDistributor Walt Disney PicturesRating PG for mild language and a brief fightRunning time 1 hour 43 minutesOpens Friday nationwide This is the anti-Kids a tale of an idyllic squeaky-clean high school without gangs drugs cheating or bullying. The worst offense appears to be cutting class -- and that happens only because the offending kid has to help his mom. Its not exactly a message movie. Even as it tries to show some depth behind the teen stereotypes it reinforces them. This is High School Musical minus the singing and dancing. Any episode of Glee or even reruns of Degrassi are more connected to real life than this Disney production. Events are predictable and characters seem like cardboard cutouts. More effort is expended devising semi-clever ways for students to ask each other to prom than in giving students dimension. Once invitations are extended and connections formed caricatured dreams come true. For the rest of us this ""forever night"" merely feels interminable.

The course of prom night never does run smooth so writer Katie Wech throws in complications a fire that destroys the decorations and forces Nova to work overtime with Jesse (Thomas McDonell) the class delinquent who has to help her in order to get his diploma. Good girl meets bad boy -- jeepers can it ever work out?Under Joe Nussbaums efficient direction the rest of ""Prom is taken up with tiny watchable secondary dramas. Novas friend Mei (Yin Chang) has to tell her boyfriend (Jared Kusnitz) shes not going to college with him but to Parsons instead. Jordan (Kylie Bunbury) needs to find the willpower to dump her playa star-athlete boyfriend Tyler (DeVaughn Nixon) whos dogging sophomore Simone (Danielle Campbell) whos the object of a classmates (Nolan Sotillo) affections. All these crises seem monumental and all are resolved by the ad break -- I mean the end credits.That ""Prom plays as pleasantly and inoffensively as it does is due to the performances particularly McDonell as the rebellious Jesse. He brings the relaxed insouciance of a young Johnny Depp to his watered-down role and hes easy enough on the eyes for the films target demo. (A recent subject-heading on the actors IMDb message boards reads ""Hello unknown hottie.) Teegarden may fare better on TVs ""Friday Night Lights; here shes all adorable grimaces and shrugs.""Prom is deeply unthreatening stuff -- ""Gossip Girl without the sex ""Skins without the drugs ""Glee without the show tunes and dysfunction -- and thats the reason for its existence. Its a sweet generic safe harbor for young kids parents and those teenagers who want to hide from the world for a couple of hours. All the girls are pretty and ethnically balanced (and if theyre not pretty theyre funny and if theyre not funny they dont exist). All the bad boys are misunderstood. There are no mean girls or bullies nor is there a computer or barely a cellphone in sight. And at the end everyone forgets their differences and dances.

By Tom Horgen Star Tribune April 28 2011 -- 336pm Richard Foreman Jr. Disney Enterprises Aimee Teegarden stars in ""Prom."" Ph Richard Foreman Jr. SMPSP Disney Enterprises Inc. All Rights Reserved. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Prom"" is pure bubble gum from its shiny wrapping to its mushy insides to its fleeting aftertaste. And sometimes theres nothing wrong with chewing bubble gum. Attention pubescents ""Prom"" is such a time. Brookside High School is the place. It exists in some nameless middle-class suburb somewhere in the great old U-S-of-A where the worst things afflicting its student body are detention and unrequited puppy love. (Teen pregnancy? Bah) Free of irony ""Prom"" is a squeaky-clean fairy-tale teenage romcom that makes ""The Breakfast Club"" look edgy. And thats just fine because this Disney product does strait-laced fairly well. Our guide through prom season is Nova (played by Aimee Teegarden from ""Friday Night Lights"") a blond-haired straight-A student on her way to Georgetown with a full academic ride. But before she graduates to the real world nothing else matters but prom. For her its not so much a rite of passage as something more akin to Manifest Destiny. Her problem She doesnt have a date. Enter Jesse the hunky prom-hating motorcycle-driving misunderstood rebel. Otherwise known as young-guy-who-looks-exactly-like-Johnny-Depp (aka actor Thomas McDonell). In a series of misbegotten events (that need no further explanation other than they were misbegotten) the pair must work together on this years massive prom decorations. Cue indie pop soundtrack and -- bam -- their bellicose relationship turns into a star-crossed love affair. PROM  1/2 out of four. Rated PG for mild language and a brief fight. ""Prom"" is populated with the usual cast of high school archetypes jocks geeks stoners jock girlfriends etc. Their couplings get screen time too as they all prepare for the ""forever night"" (Novas words). The humor in ""Prom"" is colored with enough snark to balance the gooey romance with the best jokes revolving around the travails of the schools geek caste. One of them relates the fun of finding a prom date to ""sledding and getting paralyzed."" Even for them prom is the be-all and end-all. That other major high school obsession -- hint S-E-X -- is never mentioned. The young actors are brash and bold in their looks but they barely go to first base. Alas theres a certain nobility in the films all-around wholesomeness. The dramatic acting might be a bit wooden but this is high-quality plywood. ""Prom"" is a harmless jaunt into a fanciful teenage world where the last dance really is the only thing that matters. Theres a message here and it sounds something like this Kids dream while you still can. thorgenstartribune.com 612-673-7909 tomhorgen View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet From Carrie to Shes All That and beyond prom has provided the climactic setting for so many movies that a film all about prom was inevitable. Simply titled Prom in the same way store-brand Rice Krispies get called ""Puffed Rice Cereal"" this Disney-produced teen comedy takes place in the eventful days leading up to a suburban high schools prom. Headed by Friday Night Lights star Aimee Teegardens turn as an overachieving class president and one-woman prom committee the films sprawling cast of characters faces a series of bland crises on their way to a magical night beneath a dusted-off disco ball. As prom nears their lives intersect in entirely expected ways as the film weaves a tapestry of heavily scrubbed teen life out of paper streamers and dull soundtrack cues. Its the sort of film Robert Altman might have made if he cut his teeth working for The Disney Channel. Actually that makes it sound way too interesting. Apparently set in a pocket of suburbia where well-supervised afternoon cookouts have taken the place of parties and going out for malts still counts as a hot date its a weirdly libido-less movie. That may be all its intended audience could handle but surely even the young and gullible will see every plot development coming long before Proms characters do. When for instance Teegarden is forced to save prom from certain disaster by working alongside a surly (but hawt) motorcycle-riding rebel (Thomas McDonell) its not hard to see that their sniping will soon transform into longing looks etc. etc. That would be a lot more tolerable if Prom brought even a hint of wit to that or its half-dozen or so other sub-plots the longterm couple facing a decision the boy who cant get a date and so on. Instead director Joe Nussbaum (Sydney White) working from a script by Katie Wech simply fills in the colors as the numbers demand and the cast seems unable or unwilling to do anything but hit their marks whip out blinding smiles and wait for the slow-dance happy ending.

Daily Edition Login to download Prom Movie Review 900 PM PDT 4/26/2011 by Kirk Honeycutt FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Disney A genial teen comedy set in the unreality of Disney High School. TWITTER The movie has a cheerful good nature and a solid cast of youngsters a including Aimee Teegarden and Thomas McDonell a but any resemblance between this and real high school is of course purely coincidental. Walt Disneys Prom breaks no new ground in the high school comedy genre nor does it want to. The theory seems to be that if you cast perky young actors who play their roles with the thorough conviction that this is all fresh then equally young audiences will go along with it. They probably will at that. Prom has a cheerful good nature and a solid cast of youngsters -- few adults are around and when they are they only gum things up -- so the modestly budgeted movie should attract teens and younger in theaters and soon enough in home entertainment. Any resemblance between this and real high school is of course purely coincidental. The movie written by Katie Wech and directed by Joe Nussbaum without condescension charts the final weeks leading up to a senior prom. For Nova (Aimee Teegarden) this night means everything. As a firm champion of school spirit class president and the proms chief organizer she is determined everything will be perfect -- right up until a fire destroys all the decorations and props. So the principal assigns the schools bad boy Jesse (Thomas McDonell) -- you know this because his hair is long and he rides a motorcycle -- to assist her rebuilding efforts. Naturally they cant stand each other which can only mean romance is just around the corner. There is even a moment when Jesse takes off his shirt to expose hardened muscles where Nova actually gasps. Yes she really does. Other subplots include dark-haired beauty Simone (Danielle Campbell) torn between two guys with crushes on her; egotistical sports star and senior Tyler (DeVaughn Nixon) who already has a girlfriend in Jordan (Kylie Bunbury); and her chemistry lab partner Lucas (Nolan Sotillo) a junior like herself. Meanwhile Mei (Yin Chang) is working up the courage to tell longtime boyfriend Justin (Jared Kusnitz) she is going out of state for her higher education. Running gags as opposed to actual subplots feature one gangly and shy seniors (Nicholas Braun) quest to ask a girl -- any girl -- to the prom and another male student (Joe Adler) whose description of his prom date seems like a figment of his imagination. Many of these stories need a surprisingly number of overheard conversations to move things along as the filmmakers struggle to contrive the ""right"" happy ending for each. Of course the whole notion that one night can contain so many happy endings not to mention the right ones is suspect. The film most definitely exists within the cocoon of the Disney version of teen life where getting a dream date and perhaps passing algebra are the only problems a teen could possibly confront. In the lead roles Teegarden and McDonell display the acting chops to suggest the filmmakers might have reached for a less conventional more dramatic story line. Indeed the cast throughout plays its roles with enough conviction that the screenplay doesnt do their characters justice. Nussbaums crew works hard to maintain a fresh-scrubbed look to the school its students and the small community that contains it. They succeed all too well. Couldnt there have been at least one wall with graffiti?

Its the last party of high school but also the first night of playacting at being all grown up. Youre invited to dress in stiff formals that look like they came out of your parents closet. Youre invited to dance under spangly fake stars that (if you drink enough punch) are more bedazzling than real ones. Its also an evening when the high school caste system supposedly gets abandoned and everyone is equal -- except of course for the king and queen who get to make everyone else there feel like peasants. Theres such pretense to the prom yet in a way thats the whole point. Adulthood even after youve reached it is its own pretense. Is it any wonder that most of us had a great time on prom night and also hated it a little bit too? A mere decade ago the event was still called ""the prom"" but in Prom the shrewdly wholesome and likable new Disney teen movie directed by Joe Nussbaum it is never referred to as anything but ""prom"" -- as in Who are you asking to prom? Its not even fully clear whether prom is now a noun or a verb (are you going to prom? Were going to prom like its 2099). And that signals that the prom is no mere party but in fact a state of mind. At first Prom seems a little innocuous but this winning after-school trifle has a savvy heart that grows on you. The movie understands why the prom is less important than it seems -- and also why it still looms so large. In Prom a dozen high school romantics dream maneuver and proposition their way toward the ultimate date night. At the center of it all is Aimee Teegardens Nova an adorably freckled overachiever whose bland beau is going to be away (at a college interview) for prom weekend. Dateless she is drawn to Jesse the long-haired motorcycle-riding troublemaker who earns a detention that has him building prom decorations right alongside her. Will Miss Perfect fall for the Leader of the Pack? It helps that hes played by Thomas McDonell whos not only a dead ringer for the young Johnny Depp but also has a comparable charisma. Hes a rare case of true prom royalty the natural-born kind.

In a way ""Prom"" performs a cinematic service -- assembling several decades worth of high-school movie cliches in one tidy package all building toward a prom night conveniently free of sex drugs or other traditional forms of youthful debauchery. Essentially this is a Disney Channel movie on a larger screen -- skipping the intermediate step that preceded ""High School Musical"" hitting theaters. An adorable cast (led by ""Friday Night Lights"" Aimee Teegarden) ought to provide some appeal for tweens and tykes though interest should gradually dwindle the closer one gets to actual prom-going age. Class president and prom committee chief Nova (Teegarden) introduces the pic with a voiceover that romanticizes prom night into a kind of utopian ""last call"" for teens dubbing it the one night that ""has a way of bringing us together"" (evidently ignoring high schools caste system). First-time screenwriter Katie Wech then proceeds to introduce more than a dozen characters -- some plucked from the Disney Channel/ABC Family/CW nexus of acne-vision a handful of others screen novices -- with a thrown-in homage here and there to ghosts from teen movies past. Nova for example is saddled pre-prom with a surly motorcycle-riding rebel (Thomas McDonell) who disdains the whole notion of prom night. Nova cant stand him -- at least until he strips to a tank top. Ethnically diverse and almost uniformly beautiful the cast amounts to a modern-day Mickey Mouse club. Tyler (DeVaughn Nixon) and Jordan (Kylie Bunbury) are the ideal prom king and queen but there are chinks in their relationship just as a ""Where do we go from here?"" hurdle emerges between Mei (Yin Chang) and Justin (Jared Kusnitz) who have been dating since middle school. Shy awkward Lloyd (Nicholas Braun) meanwhile spends the movie trying to find a date for the big night (and delivering comic relief); while sophomore Lucas (Nolan Sotillo) wrestles with his mad crush on dreamgirl Simone (Danielle Campbell) creating tensions with his bosom bud Corey (Cameron Monaghan). Theres even a Jeff Spicoli-type named Rolo (Joe Adler) who unleashes odd non sequiturs except theres nary a sign of hallucinogens to explain his stoner-chic demeanor. And so it goes. Director Joe Nussbaum (perhaps best known for his short ""George Lucas in Love"") can elicit only uneven performances from his cast although thats due in part to Wechs penchant for on-the-nose speech-making. Teegarden and McDonells early exchanges are particularly wince-inducing in this regard -- providing an odd throwback to the 1950s with its misunderstood-bad-boy riff -- offset only partially by their attractiveness. At times theres a temptation to root for longer music montages -- ostensibly there to move a soundtrack but equally helpful in curtailing the volume of stilted banter. While the movie obviously has to justify title and premise theres also something of an overreach in the proms significance as youths final frontier but its easy to let that slide. Expunging any youthful indiscretions by contrast has a way of stunting the drama and limiting the comedy as does the virtual absence of adults other than ""Breaking Bads"" Dean Norris as Novas protective father. Nobodys asking for a remake of ""Carrie"" here but clean enough to receive a PG rating and ""sanitized"" arent automatically the same thing. Ever the cockeyed optimist Nova paints the prom as a final chance for high-school students to experience ""one perfect moment"" something theyll remember for the rest of their lives. For the target audience ""Prom"" musters a few nice moments perhaps but nothing remotely approaching perfection -- and hardly any memorable ones.

Tonight is forever. Heaven isnt too far away. Prom.Walt Disney Pictures A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - ""This one perfect moment."" ""That soul-crushing mistress."" ""Our forever night."" These and other understated definitions are obsessively applied to a certain dreaded/anticipated ritual throughout Prom a timely pop product set in a suburban high school during the last weeks before summer break and destined for the immortality of Vitamin Cs ""Graduation (Friends Forever).""Katie Wechs script is a carousel of reassuringly familiar plot lines kept smoothly revolving. The large ensemble cast of unknowns includes a smattering of underclassmen parents and 10 seniors with prominent speaking parts. At the center is Nova Prescott (Aimee Teegarden) a straight-arrow extracurricular collector--Best All-Around Overachiever class president head of the prom decorating committee--who needs only to be duly escorted on the big night by her anti-romantic male counterpart in the high school hierarchy in order to matriculate on paper as flawless.The wrinkle comes in Jesse Richter (Thomas McDonell) a longhair detention-hall stud whos told he wont be allowed to graduate unless he reports for putative after-school decoration duty working one-on-one with Nova. What Nova least expects to happen in this intimate proximity is exactly what an audience knows is going to happen as soon as Jesse gets her on that motorcycle.Lady meets Tramp and more material divorced from any recognizable social reality piles into Prom as into an overloaded rental limo. Jesses surliness is excused and ennobled by a troubled home life and a too-cute kid brother. Star-crossed could-be couples misunderstand and miss their connection only so one of them can show up strikingly lit at the last heart-fluttering almost-too-late moment (I teared up) while inert subplots include one half of a long-term relationship delaying telling the other that their plans to go to school together wont come through.At best the Nova-Jesse romance is savvy to its own cliches; theres a scene in which Nova is crestfallen to learn that a neighboring school has chosen the same prom theme so she and Jesse break into the competitors gym to compare the decor--it gets at the teenage anxiety to be unique while still fitting in. Dewy with expectation and lip gloss Teegarden ingenues her way through selling such perennials as the Trying On Clothes Montage opposite McDonell a hottie automaton created when someone typed ""Young Johnny Depp-type"" into a supercomputer deep beneath Burbank.The other bright young things are in their assigned yearbook archetypes a New Faces of 2011 revue. Playing the player who gets played is DeVaughn Nixon with an easy-to-dislike Tiki Barber grin. Joe Adler is a character nicknamed ""Rolo"" who eats a lot of Hershey(tm) brand Rolos candy which must be some kind of new high/low in product placement. (His squint may be gently implied stoner-dom; otherwise this is a no heavy-petting lemonade-and-brownies version of high school.) Nicholas Braun pulls off a series of Komic Kutaways in which he works his way through the school directory looking for a date his lanky Lloyd trying to break out of four years of too-tall guys shyness. Theres even room in this democratic cross-section for two sophomore rock geeks--Nolan Sotillo and Cameron Monaghan--obsessed with a band called Stick Hippo who for all I know might be responsible for the neuter ""rock"" cues between scenes.The movie is titled Prom and is distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. Therefore The prophecy of Novas opening voiceover--""One night has a way of bringing everyone together""--is fulfilled by the last reel sincere hearts are rewarded bad boys are harnessed into cummerbunds and traditions are called into question and then quickly validated. The self-reinforcing system of Proms universe is so perfectly worked out in advance that all the movie needs to do is fulfill its requirements. It deserves nothing more or less than a Perfect Attendance award.
