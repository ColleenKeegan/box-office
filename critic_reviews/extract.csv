Mainstream viewers embraced Mike Judges King of the Hill yet his edgier side--as a hater of banality and idiot culture--found expression in some ace film satires. Extract for all its surface reminders of Judges 1999 cult hit Office Space (its set around a suburban bottling plant) shows its maker taking the smallest step toward lesser comic matters of infidelity and bong abuse. It feels slightly beneath him.Thats not to say you should skip it. Likable factory owner Joel (Bateman) goes from being the kind of guy who whines about his wife donning mood-killing sweatpants into an unusually liberated protagonist. Emboldened by his doper bartender buddy (Affleck excellent in support) Joel hooks up his unsuspecting bride with a gigolo--bad idea--while he uneasily pursues Cindy (Kunis) a busty gold-digging temp at his extract plant. Judge has assembled a slyly adventurous cast and even though youve seen these plot machinations before they move along briskly.But all it takes is a hint of Judges darker anticorporate instincts to get you hungry for a tougher movie. Gene Simmons more famous these days as a ravenous self-promoter than as a member of Kiss plays a malevolent attorney ready to ride a workplace accident to glory; you instantly want more of him. (Testicular injury becomes in his words a game of ""superball."") Judge has long been unafraid to court such basic instincts; Extract mostly has its writer-director turning milder. Settle down Beavis? Lets hope not.

(Miramax Film Corp) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday September 3 2009 637 PM Title Extract The latest from Mike Judge isnt exactly a laugh riot. But it does have enough hints of hilarity to stand out in a season when so many comedies feel as if they fell off a production line.Where Judges ""Office Space"" empathized with the drones ""Extract"" sides solidly with The Man. You may find yourself doing the same since Jason Batemans Joel is the saddest CEO weve seen in a while. Sure it looks like he has all the trappings of success his own business manufacturing food flavorings a caring wife (""SNLs"" Kristen Wiig) and a beautiful home. Unfortunately his wife is dangerously bored his house is being stalked by a lunatic neighbor (David Koechner) and his do-nothing employees are ready to mutiny. Then theres the guy who wants to sue him (Clifton Collins Jr.) for an on-the-job injury the lawyer whos threatening to bankrupt him (KISS Gene Simmons) and the gold-digging grifter (Mila Kunis) hoping to take him for all hes got left.And did we mention the best friend (Ben Affleck) who continually doles out bad advice along with unidentifiable drugs?The truth is Judge takes such a gentle approach to Joels ongoing nightmare that its easy to assume hes still scarred from the failure of his edgily acidic ""Idiocracy."" But at the very least he could have used more time to pull things together. His script is all over the place while the distracted direction could most kindly be characterized as laid-back. Still he has found the ideal leading man in Bateman who hits just the right notes of bemused helplessness. The entire cast in fact seems to be having fun with Affleck and Koechner cheerfully stealing each one of their scenes. And the jokes come often enough to leave us consistently amused and occasionally delighted. Judge may not always hit the satirical highs of ""Office Space"" (or ""Beavis and Butt-head"" or ""King of the Hill"") but he never lacks for flair.

Jason Bateman stars as Joel and Mila Kunis stars as Cindy in Mike Judges Extract. Photo Sam Urdank Associated Press Extract 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Meet Joel (Jason Bateman). Joel owns an extract factory. Joel bottles ambrosial concentrates of vanilla almonds cherries and smores. At work each day Joel juggles the demands of a small-business owner dealing with stalled assembly lines quirky workers and a plant manager (J.K. Simmons) who calls almost all of them ""dinkus."" At home Joels wife (Kristen Wiig) dons sweatpants after 8 p.m. Once she cinches those babies thats it -- no sex no way nuh-uh. Joels nightly commute home is a race against the clock fueled by hormones and complicated by a prattling neighbor (David Koechner) who drones on and on about a Rotary Club dinner. Things couldnt get much worse right? Which means theyre about to. And so they do -- when a couple of old birds at work delay the line piling up extract bottles and sparking a freak accident that fells a co-worker (Clifton Collins Jr.) or at least one significant part of him. Soon after a steamy new temp (Mila Kunis) materializes at work. Joel doesnt realize shes both a drifter and a grifter so he has no cause to suspect her flirty queries about the extract biz. And hes a sucker for it because he just keeps missing that ""8 oclock sweat-pant deadline."" Written and directed by Beavis and Butt-head creator Mike Judge Extract has a bit more sentimental bounce to it than his last stab at workplace comedy 1999s slacker-praise song Office Space -- now beloved by printer-smashing cubicle drones across America. Joels problem isnt so much professional ennui as a mounting accretion of oddballs Every day in every way his life is derailed by eccentrics. Judge wisely exploits Batemans gift for pickled reaction shots (see Arrested Development) playing his stars everyguy exasperation off a colorful supporting cast. There are some priceless character turns Matt Schulze as an explosive pot dealer; Ben Affleck looser and woolier than usual as a bartender who offers dubious advice along with chancy pharmaceuticals; 90210s Dustin Milligan as a halfwit gigolo with rosebud lips and a confused pair of eyebrows; T.J. Miller as an emphatically good-natured grindcore frontman. In addition Gene Simmons (yup that Gene Simmons) portrays a scuzzball lawyer with disquieting hair though Im not sure that last bit is acting. The weak links here are Kuniss uninteresting scam artist -- shes hot but flat like Florida -- and her share of the script which unfolds in rote fashion until the expected conclusion. The ending is heavier on harmony than irony but thats none too shocking in a film that scores big laughs off a pitiably earnest hooker. (Or as Wiigs character describes him ""Stupid Brad. Stupid dumb dumb Brad."") Extract isnt an instant classic but it bumps along agreeably its humor culled from serial bad decisions mock-romantic discontent (""Nobody cares about extracts"") and lots of spirited overacting ripe with good intentions. Bateman plays the straight man with the tact of a frazzled yuppie a crispness in his chinos and his bearing. While Joel puts the extract in bottles Bateman puts the starchy charm in Joel. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals KitchenAid Small Kitchen Appliances at eBay Up to 51% off +...

Were pleased to report the same can be said of writer-director Mike Judges comedy about sex lies and conveyor belts. It doesnt break ground. Doesnt need to. It is a laugh-out-loud pleasure about work and married life that provides a respite from bromances and other tired comedy trends. Good-natured ""Extract"" laughs at -- not always with -- its working-stiff characters without expressing contempt for them. The cast is sharp and includes J.K. Simmons Kristen Wiig and Ben Affleck. But it is Jason Bateman as Joel Reynold who acts as the center of a tale that swirls with a series of unlikely convergences. Owner of the company that produces essences for flavoring Joel can be found late afternoons speeding (ever so slightly) homeward to arrive before wife Suzie (Wiig) slips into something entirely too comfortable. Once the sweatpants are on all bets are off. Blocking his valiant attempts is chatty neighbor Nathan (David Koechner). Their exchanges are among the films running jokes that never tire. Joels frustrated. Deeply so. A messy version of Kismet occurs when Cindy (Mila Kunis) arrives at the plant. Earlier Reynolds fastest sorter Step (Clifton Collins Jr.) suffered a freak accident. Still earlier we watched Cindy con her way through a few businesses on the way to fateful employment at Reynolds. Yes she turns heads. Including Joels. With the ill-conceived but amusing encouragement of his friend Dean (Affleck) Joel hires a gigolo to seduce his wife. The theory is simple if morally flawed If she cheats he can. Dustin Milligan is absurd as Brad the fledgling man-whore Joel hires. Judge makes fine sport of Brads heartfelt idiocy cuing up music fit for daytime drama confessions. Once Cindy shows up its all a snowball growing as it careens downhill. A possible deal with General Mills is endangered. Step begins thinking lawsuit. Personal property goes missing. Theres suspicion on the factory floor between co-workers. Former Kiss frontman Gene Simmons enters the fray as a scary litigator. To borrow one of the movies themes Its a lot to keep moving without the crates crashing down. But Judge is an able sorter of subplots and asides. Some of you know and have loved Bateman since the Fox series ""Arrested Development."" Others discovered him more recently in ""Juno"" in which he made his characters advances on the teen birth mom altogether human though no less icky. In Will Smiths ""Hancock"" Bateman brought believable concern and agile wit to his role as a publicist trying to burnish the superheros self- tarnished image. As Joel Bateman depicts a guy more upstanding than not. And its his better nature that makes for so many of the better gags. These days it appears to be a rare gift to do comedy in a way that comes across as smart but never superior or willfully crass. Bateman has that talent to spare. Apparently he likes the characters he chooses flaws and all. He makes us like them too. ""EXTRACT"" R for language sexual references some drug use. 1 hour 32 minutes.

By Andy Klein September 4 2009 Save for later Saved Jason Bateman stars as Joel left and Clifton Collins Jr. stars as Step in a scene from Extract. Miramax/Sam Urdank/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? After his TV success with ""Beavis and Butthead"" and ""King of the Hill"" Mike Judge came up with ""Office Space"" (1999) which achieved iconic status as the film about cubicle culture. His new ""Extract"" is similar except the scene has moved from white collar to blue and the sympathies tilt ever so slightly from working stiffs to management. Jason Bateman plays the diligent honest entrepreneur whose cooking-extract factory is suddenly threatened when a curvy con woman (Mila Kunis) convinces an injured employee (Clifton Collins Jr.) to sue. At the same time he foolishly listens to the harebrained advice of a bartender buddy (Ben Affleck) about dealing with his sagging marriage. The result doesnt seem as fresh as ""Office Space"" but Judge still comes up with enough laughs to deserve our attention. He is helped more than a little by hilarious work from supporting players Kristen Wiig David Koechner J.K. Simmons and Dustin Milligan.

Liam Lacey From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Thursday Sep. 03 2009 523PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 319PM EDT Comments AA Extract Written and directed by Mike Judge Starring Jason Bateman J.K. Simmons and Mila Kunis Classification 14A Mike Judges new workplace comedy Extract comes a decade after Office Space  a cult favourite. In retrospect the wry and silly Office Space hit on something fundamental about the absurdities of modern cubicle life. In his new movie Judge has changed the workplace to a small owner-operated factory and this time the beleaguered everyman hero is the boss Joel Reynolds (Jason Bateman). Rather than relishing his status as the kind of guy American politicians point to as the backbone of the nation Joel finds that mid-level success is a dead-end. Hes sick of ""baby-sitting"" his staff of sorters bottlers and lift-truck drivers. They include a spiteful senior employee carping about everyone elses laziness (Beth Grant) a would-be heavy-metal rock star (T.J. Miller) and an operations manager who cant be bothered remembering anyones name (J.K. Simmons). His home life is even more frustrating. Each night Joel gets home late from work to his suburban spread trying to avoid his tenacious bore of a neighbour (David Koechner). As soon as he comes through the door Joels wife Suzie ( Saturday Night Live s Kristen Wiig underwritten and under-used) pulls the draw string on her sweatpants. Thats the signal that theres no sex again tonight. Other kinds of pressures are mounting. Food giant General Mills may be interested in buying his operation but the workers create a chain of accidents that almost neuters one of the dumber sorters Step (Clifton Collins Jr.). If someone persuades Step to launch a lawsuit Joels company is finished. The accident hits the local newspapers which gains the attention of a sexy con artist Cindy (Mila Kunis) who applies for a temp job at the factory with a scam in mind. On her first day she brazenly flirts with Joel expressing an improbable interest in the world of bottled extracts. Hes instantly lust-struck. Later Joel confides his fixation with Cindy to his low-life bartender friend Dean (an unexpectedly funny Ben Affleck under long hair and a beard). After plying Joel with alcohol and a stupefying pill Dean convinces his friend to hire a gigolo (a dim but studly landscaper named Brad) to have an affair with Suzie. This will give Joel the moral licence to hit on his hot new employee. As contrived as this sounds Bateman has a regular-guy down-to-earth appeal but the script is often excessively broad. One scene includes his encounter with a threatening pot dealer and the worlds biggest bong. In another he is confronted by a sleazy extortionate lawyer overplayed by Kiss front man Gene Simmons. A larger discomfort with Extract is an ambivalent attitude about comedy and social class. Mocking an officious middle-manager is always fair game; ridiculing blue-collar workers who resent their mindless jobs just feels mean. At one point Joel refers to Cindys sex appeal as ""working class"" and gets challenged on it by a working-class guy. Embarrassed Joel amends the adjective to ""slutty"" and then ""nasty."" This is what Barack Obama might call a ""teaching moment"" but Judge lets the opportunity slip away.

Media San Francisco Chronicle Extract Comedy. Starring Jason Bateman. Directed by Mike Judge. (R 91 minutes. At Bay Area theaters) Meet Joel. Joel (Jason Bateman) owns an extract factory. Joel bottles ambrosial concentrates of vanilla almonds cherries and smores. At work each day Joel juggles the demands of a small business owner dealing with stalled assembly lines quirky workers and a plant manager (J.K. Simmons) who calls almost all of them ""dinkus."" At home Joels wife (Kristen Wiig) dons sweatpants after 8 p.m. Once she cinches those babies thats it - no sex no way nuh-uh. Joels nightly commute home is a race against the clock fueled by hormones and complicated by a prattling neighbor (David Koechner) who drones on and on about a Rotary Club dinner. Things couldnt get much worse right? Which means theyre about to. And so they do - when a couple of old birds at work delay the line piling up extract bottles and sparking a freak accident that fells a co-worker (Clifton Collins Jr.) or at least one significant part of him.

Photo Sam Urdank AP Review Extract - a life derailed by oddballs 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Soon after a steamy new temp (Mila Kunis) materializes at work. Joel doesnt realize shes both a drifter and a grifter so he has no cause to suspect her flirty queries about the extract biz. And hes a sucker for it because he just keeps missing that ""8 oclock sweat-pant deadline."" Written and directed by ""Beavis and Butt-head"" creator Mike Judge ""Extract"" has a bit more sentimental bounce to it than his last stab at workplace comedy 1999s slacker-praise song ""Office Space"" - now beloved by printer-smashing cubicle drones across America. Joels problem isnt so much professional ennui as a mounting accretion of oddballs every day in every way his life is derailed by eccentrics. Judge wisely exploits Batemans gift for pickled reaction shots (see ""Arrested Development"") playing his stars everyguy exasperation off a colorful supporting cast. There are some priceless character turns Matt Schulze as an explosive pot dealer; Ben Affleck looser and woollier than usual as a bartender who offers dubious advice along with chancy pharmaceuticals; Dustin Milligan of ""90210"" as a halfwit gigolo with rosebud lips and a confused pair of eyebrows; T.J. Miller as an emphatically good-natured grindcore front man. In addition Gene Simmons portrays a scuzzball lawyer with disquieting hair though Im not sure that last bit is acting. ""Extract"" isnt an instant classic but it bumps along agreeably its humor culled from serial bad decisions mock-romantic discontent and lots of spirited overacting ripe with good intentions. Bateman plays the straight man with the tact of a frazzled yuppie a crispness in his chinos and his bearing. While Joel puts the extract in bottles Bateman puts the starchy charm in Joel. -- Advisory Language sexual references and some drug use. Mike Judge talks about ""Extract.""

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Sept. 3 2009 815 PM The Discreet Charm of the American Bonehead Mike Judges Extract is better than Office Space. By Dana Stevens After youve seen Extract come back and listen to our Spoiler Special discussion on Mike Judges latest comedy You can also click hereto download the MP3 file or youll find this and dozens of other Spoiler Specials in our iTunes podcast feed here. Jason Bateman in Extract The tag line for Extract (Miramax) the fourth feature film from Mike Judge promises ""a comedy with a flavor of its own."" Thats certainly true. Judge cultists will recognize the Beavis and Butt-Head auteurs signature blend of social satire broad physical comedy and lovingly observed middle-American stupidity. But Extracts particular flavor profile may strike some Judge-heads as overly sweet--its the sunniest and least angry of his films--while viewers less disposed to love his work may find it simply bland. Personally I found Extract to be Judges best nonanimated work yet. For all of Office Spaces comic invention that movie had a hole at its center Ron Livingstons protagonist was an uninteresting guy played by (sorry Ron) an uninteresting actor. And though Idiocracy was brilliant at extrapolating current trends into a dystopic American future (one day we will water our crops with sports drinks) it ultimately fell victim to its own high concept. Extract is more modest in its ambitions a 98-minute goof with little more on its mind than cracking us up. After the past few years of comedies in the Apatow mold its refreshing to find a movie that doesnt combine that simple goal with a secondary agenda to gross us out (babies crowning naked fat guys with flaccid penises) or to make us cry or to teach us life lessons. For all of Judges comic absurdity his universe is as familiar as an Arbys drive-through--I grew up in the suburb of a Southern city much like the unnamed town where Extract is set. The hotel-chain sports bars and pretentiously named subdivisions where the action unfolds are both cartoonish versions of American alienation and sociologically precise portraits of places weve all been. Advertisement Jason Bateman whose specialty is the poker-faced reaction shot was born to embody a classic Mike Judge protagonist the sole sane inhabitant of a ridiculous world. Joel Reynold runs a successful flavoring-extract factory that he founded himself. (His story about a childhood revelation involving root-beer-flavored cookies tells us all we need to know about this characters dogged earnestness.) Joel loves his work but hes sex-starved at home; his wife Suzie (Saturday Night Lives Kristen Wiig) bored by her own career in supermarket-coupon design cinches her sweatpants so tight as to discourage all ingress. So Joel spends nights drinking at the Sidelines sports bar where the spaced-out bartender Dean (Ben Affleck resplendent in Jesus hair) dispenses drugs and terrible advice. One night after accidentally ingesting a horse tranquilizer Joel finds himself agreeing to a particularly ill-advised Dean scheme He will pay a gigolo to seduce his wife thus freeing himself to cheat in turn with Cindy (Mila Kunis) the sexy new temp at the factory. To Joels dismay the plan works so well that the gigolo Brad (a transcendently vacant cretin played by Dustin Milligan) is soon having a full-blown affair with Joels wife and trying to bill Joel for each assignation. In the meantime a terrible (yet slapstick-laden) accident at the factory has left a worker Step (Clifton Collins Jr.) with only one testicle. Step hires a shyster lawyer (played by KISSs Gene Simmons in an unforgettable wig) and threatens to sue the factory for millions. Step in turn becomes the prey of Cindy who turns out to be a remorseless grifter with an eye on the potential settlement money. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Extract packs a lot of narrative into a small-scale movie--I havent even mentioned Joels maddening neighbor (David Koechner) who in the films best running gag stops Joels car on its way out the driveway and traps him in endless conversations. Though not every subplot gets resolved in a satisfying (or even logical) way I admired Judges attempt to structure comedy into the story rather than following the sketch-comedy model of stopping the action short to insert a laugh-getting scene. And his skill at capturing the vernacular of the American bonehead means that even minor characters like Clifton Collins one-balled factory worker or a tattooed ""grindcore"" enthusiast played by T.J. Miller get at least one memorably funny scene. Like Judges first two live-action films Extract seems destined to do minor business at the box office but achieve a kind of immortality as a cult DVD to be quoted from at parties and passed around to friends. Which may be just fine by its creator--as Beavis and Butt-head have taught us snickering with your friends in front of the television is one of lifes great joys.

He loves his wife Suzie (Kristen Wiig). Hes good to the employees of the company he built from the ground up a factory that produces flavoring extracts of all sorts from cookies and cream to root beer. Unlike his gruff business partner Brian (J.K. Simmons) he knows all of them by name from shrill Mary (Beth Grant) to Step (Clifton Collins Jr.) an earnest goofball who aspires to be floor manager. Because of Joel Reynolds Extract is the coziest factory around. (See TIMEs top 10 movie bromances.) But Joels life is not without frustrations. Theres the one-man gauntlet he has to run in order to enter his spacious suburban home in the evenings a persistent needy neighbor Nathan (David Koechner) whose desire for dull chitchat is matched only by his obtuseness. And if Joel has any hope of enjoying marital relations with Suzie -- his most fervent desire -- he must escape Nathans clutches and get into the house before she puts her sweatpants on a nightly ritual that happens at 8 p.m. Judge who created Beavis and Butt-head and whose 1999 film Office Space is a cult favorite in the workplace-comedy genre frames Suzie tying the drawstring of her sweatpants in dramatic close-up with the kind of musical fanfare that might accompany a gun coming out of a holster in a western. Its a door slamming shut on Joels manhood and hes as helpless at opening it as he is at closing one on the tedious Nathan. He is hog-tied by his own amiability. (See the all TIME 100 movies.) A protagonist like Joel is a sitting duck about to have his world upended; think Jeff Daniels in Something Wild or another sexually frustrated Joel the one played by Tom Cruise in Risky Business. From the first frames of the film in which a kittenish con woman named Cindy (Mila Kunis) is introduced in the midst of a deft act of shoplifting we know this Joel is headed for trouble -- girl and likely financial. After Cindy reads about an industrial accident in which Step loses a component (and a half ) of his manhood and stands to gain an insurance and lawsuit settlement shes a freight train steaming toward Reynolds Extract. But were also hoping the con woman isnt too hard on the factory or its owner; its Batemans great gift to be able to make us inordinately fond of a rock-solid average guy. Hes become so good at this that it comes as a delightful shock when he plays against type as in Juno in which his character turned out to be a jerk giving the movie just the jolt it needed. Whenever Joel is stymied by Suzies sweatpants he ends up at the sports bar at the nearby Marriott the aptly named Sidelines where his old pal Dean (Ben Affleck shaggy as a bear) tends bar. Dean believes Xanax is the cure for everything including the common cold. Their conversations head in absurd directions -- Dean thinks Joel should hire a gigolo to seduce Suzie so he can sleep with the alluring Cindy guilt-free a suggestion that ultimately does more damage than Cindy does -- but at the same time have a real naturalism. Imagine Pulp Fictions Jules and Vincent sitting at the Marriott bar with no mission more pressing than peeling off a womans sweatpants. Judges gifts parallel those of his leading man. His plotting is full of funny unpredictable moments but lacks the grating hysteria of the comic genre. In one scene Joel arrives at a party sees Cindy then leaves. To skip a party scene involving romantic interests is tantamount to blasphemy in the wacky-comedy genre but its the right decision on Judges part. Were never sure until the end exactly how things are going to end up for Joel. Stylistically the movie is so modest that notable stars like Affleck and Gene Simmons -- who gives a frighteningly vivid performance as an ambulance-chasing lawyer -- barely register as themselves. When Affleck cameos for indie director Kevin Smith theres a lot of fussing as if theres a ""Thanks Ben"" banner hanging behind him. Judges take is a welcome contrast. Its the character actors who get to shine here. Koechner is grotesquely right as Nathan and Saturday Night Live graduate Wiig is far more appealing and nuanced than the sweatpant routine would suggest. Collins practically unrecognizable as the sweet love interest from Sunshine Cleaning earlier this year is turning into the chameleon to watch. The cult appeal of Office Space a movie told from the point of view of the office drone has always puzzled me a bit but the truth is I watched it from my couch on DVD always a soporific setting. Im happy to have seen Extract in a theater where the largeness of the screen allows the smallness of the movie to grow on you and where every subtle comic twitch on Batemans face can be seen and appreciated. Theres nothing vanilla about him. See TIMEs top 10 back-to-school iPhone applications.

In other words she creates crossword puzzles. Her occupation notwithstanding Mary doesnt have a clue. Neither does anyone else involved in ""All About Steve"" a head-banging excuse for a comedy. Calling Mary socially inept is akin to describing Hurricane Katrina as a summer shower. It ought to go without saying that shes staggeringly bright. After all in the Hollywood comedy calculus the price that smart women must pay for an impressive I.Q. is a generalized klutziness particularly around attractive men. ENLARGE Sandra Bullock stalks Bradley Cooper in All About Steve. Twentieth Century Fox We are apparently meant to think that Marys gaucheries her twitchy oddness are a professional hazard. In fact they seem like a pathology. A simple question elicits a babbling waterfall of a response often in several languages. She lives at home with her parents chats with her gerbil and would be absolutely naked without her bright red go-go boots. ""They make my toes feel like theyre camping"" she explains. Bafflingly. These boots are made for stalking when after a disastrous blind date with a news cameraman (Bradley Cooper) Mary incomprehensibly decides hes the guy for her and begins a relentless pursuit across the country through hurricanes tornados and other disasters. Overlaid with the story of Marys search for love is a toothless shopworn satire about media hype with a subplot borrowed from Billy Wilders ""Ace in the Hole""--a tale of a mine-shaft disaster. Honoring the conventions of movies made for the chick-lit crowd Ms. Bullock supplies the ruefully confessional voice-over narration. Like everything else in the movie it is--five-letter word for lacking significance--inane. ENLARGE Nisreen Faour works in fast food in Amreeka. National Geographic Entertainment Amreeka Its a two-hour commute to her grindingly dull job at a bank. Passing through the West Bank checkpoint is a daily torment. Her husband left her long ago for his svelte girlfriend. Her mother is an unrelenting nag. But Muna Farah (Nisreen Faour) the center of the modest poignant ""Amreeka"" stoically carries on. The joy of her life and its solace is her adolescent son Fadi (Melkar Muallem). When unexpectedly Muna has the opportunity to move to the U.S. shes initially uncertain. But when Fadi mouths off to an Israeli soldier at the checkpoint the ugly scene that follows puts an end to all hesitation. Its off to Illinois where the two move in with Munas sister Raghda Halaby (Hiam Abbass); Raghdas physician husband Nabeel (Yussef Abu Warda); and the couples three young daughters. But this particular land of promise doesnt live up to its billing. The only job Muna can find is behind the counter at a White Castle. The recent opening salvos of the Iraq war have put Fadi in the crosshairs of a gang of bullies at his new school have sent patients scurrying from Nabeels medical practice and have made the family Christian Palestinians a target of death threats. ""Were a minority here and a minority there"" says Muna ruefully. ""Amreeka"" deals with the way that conflicts on the home front mirror those on the front lines. One of the Halaby daughters for example puts a line of tape down the center of the bedroom she shares with a younger sister forbidding any incursions; Muna and Fadi are at odds about how to handle the rough situation at school. Raghda fights with her eldest daughter who is she thinks becoming too American and she quarrels bitterly with her husband about how best to be armed against bias attacks. The movie sometimes feels obvious and schematic. Munas co-worker a kid with blue hair and a pierced lip revels in his outsider posture and Munas potential love interest is the Jewish principal of her sons high school--but the fine performances here make up for a lot. Writer-director Cherien Dabis shot ""Amreeka"" in a gritty documentary style that reflects the often grim reality of the characters situation. But he also knows how to mine the comic situations that are often part of the immigrant experience. ""Occupation?"" demands the U.S. agent at passport control. For a moment Muna is puzzled then her brow clears in sudden understanding. ""Yes"" she replies. ""We have been occupied for 40 years."" Most important Mr. Dabis knows that home--what a fraught place--is in equal measures where the hurt is and where the heart is. ENLARGE Ben Affleck left gives relationship advice to Jason Bateman in Extract. Miramax Extract Joel Reynold--Jason Bateman doing yeomans service--is the owner of a small business in ""Extract"" a comedy by Mike Judge thats as artificially flavored as the product in its title. A mild-mannered nice guy Joel is getting no support at his factory. The employees responsible for bottling and packing essence of root beer cherry vanilla and smore are a ragtag bunch of racists louts and shirkers. And Joel is getting no satisfaction at home. His wife Suzie (Kristen Wiig in a thankless role) has exactly no interest in warming up the sheets with him. So whats a sexually frustrated--but uxorious--guy to do? If youre Joel you pour out your troubles to your bartender best friend (Ben Affleck nice and laid back) who gives stunningly bad advice. Soon enough Joel is getting plenty of action though not quite the kind he had in mind. Mr. Judge has done better more pointed work before notably in the cult-favorite workplace comedy ""Office Space."" Here by contrast were dealing with one-note characters among them a sexy grifter (Mila Kunis) and a dim-witted gigolo (Dustin Milligan); situations that stretch all credibility; and jokes that are never more than sort of funny. DVD FOCUS ENLARGE In America (2002) Like so many immigrants before them Sarah and Johnny Sullivan (Samantha Morton and Paddy Considine) and their two daughters are coming to America--in this case from Ireland illegally across the U.S.-Canadian border--in search of a new and better life. This touching unassuming film directed by Jim Sheridan (he also co-wrote the screenplay with his daughters) deftly skirts sentimentality as it chronicles the familys new life in a Hells Kitchen walk-up apartment. ENLARGE While You Were Sleeping (1995) Sandra Bullock is Lucy a lonely and all but invisible ticket taker at a Chicago elevated train station. Shes certainly invisible to Peter Callahan (Peter Gallagher) the object of her desperate hopeless longings. When Lucy saves Peter from even greater danger after hes mugged at the station enormous confusions ensue. Peter falls into a coma and Lucy is mistakenly identified as his fiancee. Shes embraced by his family and thanks to Peters brother (Bill Pullman) is clearly set to live out her dreams in this winsome Cinderella story. ENLARGE Speed (1994) So you didnt think they had public transportation in the greater Los Angeles area? Well think again. In this very aptly named movie Dennis Hopper plays a mad bomber whos loaded a Santa Monica bus with an explosive device and wired it to be activated once the vehicles speed goes above 50 miles per hour. Thereafter if it drops below 50 mph--POW Sandra Bullock is the passenger conscripted to get behind the wheel keep her eyes on the speedometer and the road and flirt with SWAT policeman Keanu Reeves. --Joanne Kaufman Find television listings at LocateTV.

Problem is shes a criminal drifter but his minds so scrambled by wife Kristen Wiigs disinterest in sex (unless its with the pool boy) and best friend Ben Afflecks efforts to distract him with ketamine and bong hits and beer that he doesnt realize that shes a force destructive enough to take down his entire company. Writer-director Mike Judges latest effort to capture the je ne sais quaff of the working man his vices and his daily agonies is as solid as the two great entries in his canon Office Space and Idiocracy. Which means no one will admit they liked it for a year and then magically copies will appear on every friends DVD shelf. In a slight tweak from his formula here Judge isnt focusing on the oppressed white collar or a culture of morons but a smart practical boss man who is so disgruntled by his home life that he never quite realizes hes a symbol of wealth and success for the grunts on the factory floor (excellent comedians and character actors like Beth Grant Clifton Collins Jr. and T.J. Miller) who dont dream higher than being floor manager--or of working in a place that doesnt hire Mexicans. That Batemans employees dont have better options is one of Judges running droll jokes; when they threaten to strike if he accepts a buyout from General Mills Bateman flatly asks them where else theyd rather work--the answers so plain he doesnt even have to twist the knife. Part of Bateman reclaiming his life is realizing that hes lucky to be on top of his own company even if very few people give a damn about flavorings besides second-in-command J.K. Simmons (my favorite actor this year). Extract is consistently quietly funny and like everything Judge does a little morally perverse under the surface as Bateman learns that one of the keys to happiness is an attitude of ""Let them eat cherry-flavored cake."" 0 Comments Be the first to comment You must be logged in to post a comment.

ABOUT THE MOVIE Extract   (out of four) Stars Jason Bateman Mila Kunis Ben Affleck Kristen Wiig David KoechnerDirectorMike JudgeDistributor Miramax FilmsRating R for language sexual references and some drug useRunning time One hour 32 minutesOpening tonight in some theaters and Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY In Extract writer-director Mike Judge-- creator of TVs animated series Beavis and Butt-head and King of the Hill as well as the 1999 movie Office Space-- has fashioned his most accessible and mainstream adult comedy. This amusing ensemble comedyis getting a bigger push from its studio than did Judges last effort 2006s Idiocracy. While that film was a more biting social satire it also was sloppier and less focused than Extract which stars Jason Bateman as Joel a frustrated and put-upon Everyman who owns a flavor extract factory. Ben Affleck plays Dean his long-haired best buddy a bartender who is as offbeat as Bateman is buttoned-down. They make an odd couple but the films best moments belong to them particularly their weird substance-infused interactions. TRAILER Get a taste of Extract Affleck ought to do more quirky character roles rather than leading-man parts in action films. Bateman plays his low-key straight man/protagonist to perfection. The story features a chain reaction of bad ideas bad plans and bad decisions leading to routinely awful sometimes disastrous but humorous outcomes. More farcical than satirical some extended gags are hit and miss and a few characters verge on caricature. But it all comes together with an amiable gently edgy sense of humor. Joels beleaguered company may be bought out by General Mills; he is struggling with a rough patch in his marriage to Suzie (Kristen Wiig) and he finds himself guiltily attracted to Cindy (Mila Kunis) a clever temp/con artist whose manipulations send his business to the brink of ruin. In the process he tangles with a megalomaniacal lawyer (Kiss Gene Simmons) and heeds some ridiculous advice from the hippy-dippy Dean. A moronic gigolo (Dustin Milligan) plays into the hilarity. An unctuous busybody neighbor (an amusing David Koechner) who repeatedly intrudes on Joel and Suzie is an offbeat highlight. J.K. Simmons as Brian Joels second-in-command also is a hoot. Judge may not have the workplace comedy down as smoothly as say Judd Apatow does with relationship comedies but he has an ear for comical dialogue and an eye for a top-notch ensemble cast. Extract ably blends sharp humor and a sense of gleeful absurdity. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Reader Editor Brent Jones.

Comments (1) click to enlarge Extract Recommended 2009 From Beavis and Butt-Head to King of the Hill to Office Space Mike Judge has become our most dogged examiner of middle-American foolishness; no other comedy filmmaker more skillfully exploits that nagging sense that youre surrounded by idiots. This acerbic farce centers on a small flavor-extract plant whose bored owner (Jason Bateman) frustrated with his dull-witted employees and sex-free marriage gets a serious case of the hots for his slinky new employee (Mila Kunis). Egged on by his callow buddy (a slumming Ben Affleck) he hires a brain-dead pool boy (Dustin Milligan) to seduce his wife (Kristen Wiig) reasoning that her infidelity will give him license to cheat. As usual with Judge stupidity isnt just rampant--its contagious. With J.K. Simmons David Koechner Clifton Collins Jr. and KISS bassist Gene Simmons as a reptilian personal-injury lawyer. R 90 min.

Sometimes his characters - Jason Bateman as a flavor-extract factory owner Kristen Wiig as his wife Ben Affleck as an advice-slinging barkeep and Mila Kunis as a sexy grifter - are casting the lines out and pulling in the er jokes. And sometimes they just seem to be standing there not exactly idiots but not anyone to care about either.Judge creator of Beavis and Butt-head (remember that quaint 20th-century duo?) the animated series King of the Hill the sly workplace comedy Office Space and the little-seen but cult-spawning Idiocracy definitely shows his penchant for deadpan drollery in Extract. But sometimes things can be too deadpan Batemans Joel Reynold lamenting the lack of a sex life with his wife Suzie (Wiig) confides to his friend Dean (Affleck) and gets little more than a shrug in response. If Preston Sturges is famous for his breakneck-pace screwball farces Judges Extract is lets-not-even-break-a-sweat.But then Extracts matter-of-fact nuttiness starts to take over. A ricocheting mishap in Reynolds Extract plant results in a worker injury which causes the comely con artist Cindy (Kunis) to start thinking lawsuits and marriage which brings in a sleazeball personal-injury lawyer (Gene Simmons of Kiss) which jeopardizes the corporate buyout of the family-owned factory which threatens 1) the employees job security and 2) Joels early-retirement plans.And then theres a whole hire-this-male-prostitute-dude-to-have-sex-with-your-wife scenario - morally dubious to be sure but rife with narrative possibilities. Bateman and Wiig are gifted comic actors who can easily steal a movie out from under their co-stars but here the two are working in such flat and restrained tones that the humor gets tamped down - making Extract a comedy working at cross-purposes.Its also a comedy in which just about everybody does something ethically troublesome lying adultery theft. The movie stops short of murder but there is a corpse (and if you can be killed by a rant then maybe it is a case of homicide after all).A mix of coolheaded cultural satire and anxiety-inducing workplace and marital shenanigans Extract is an odd project. Its smarter than most of the comedies out there right now but that doesnt necessarily make it funnier.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Email| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Sometimes youre willing to give a comedy the benefit of the doubt. If you laugh thats enough. But a good movie can connect that comedy to how we live in the world. Or it takes risks and demonstrates a real sensibility. Mike Judge usually gets most of the way there. His animated television shows - ""Beavis and Butt-Head and ""King of the Hill are two - found perverse comic life in Middle American monotony. Characters stagnated on the sofa in front of the television or yammered around a grill in somebodys backyard. Those shows bespoke an America where the suburban normal absorbed the weird the way a paper towel accommodates a spill. Like the folks over at ""The Simpsons Judge is a comedian who can find the poetic glories in stupidity.You can feel him straining for both effects in ""Extract a meandering only fitfully funny live-action comedy with Jason Bateman as Joel the owner of a flavor extract business. Joel exists in chronic frustration. His employees on the manufacturing floor are nincompoops whose incompetence manages to cost a worker named Step (Clifton Collins Jr.) one of his testicles. The company is on the verge of being sold to General Mills which is waiting to see if Step sues before it makes a move.Lately Joels been trying to get home before 8 p.m. the exact time his wife Suzie (Kristen Wiig) loses interest in sex with him. (She would rather watch ""Dancing With the Stars.) Theres a possibility for relief with Cindy (Mila Kunis) a grifter with the pertness of a Maxim cover girl. She seduces her way into Joels company and Steps life for his lawsuit money her sloe eyes popping open when she reads about the accident in the paper. (The camera jerks ecstatically between jackpot phrases on the page - ""million-dollar settlement and ""lost a testicle.) Joel wants to sleep with her but doesnt feel he can unless he knows Suzie is cheating too. So he hires a pretty young dunce (Dustin Milligan in a wonderful haze) to pretend to be their pool boy and bed her. To Joels astonishment it works hilariously well.""Extract is the opposite of ""Office Space Judges now-beloved film about a life spent toiling amid cubicles. In that movie the bosses were morons. In this one the morons are the drones. A movie that mocks their incompetence would have to draw clear archetypes or create recognizably human characters.Unfortunately Judge is just whacking at pinata-size sketches.One reason the popularity of ""Office Space grows with time (it was released with no fanfare in 1999) is that more people enter the workforce and discover they too work for idiots. It takes a heartless more eagle-eyed farceur to make a movie about the idiots who work for you. Like the hero in Judges previous movie a monotonous concept piece called ""Idiocracy Joel is usually the smartest man in the room. But he needs a foil. For a minute it looks as if might be Cindy but she turns into the cupcake you were afraid shed be.Nevertheless theres classic screwball comedy lurking in this material a cynics recognition that the world runs crookedly. But the movie is logy and repetitive. If we see the ubiquitous utility player David Koechner once as Joels pathologically talkative neighbor we see him a dozen times. And even a little of Gene Simmonss sleazy ambulance-chaser is too much. The scenes clump together. Rather than escalate to a head they shuffle sideways.Bateman at least reaches a boil. Hes very good when both backed into obnoxiousness and required to play it straight. The look on his face after he takes a hit off a bong as big as a light saber is priceless. He looks like he might actually choke to death. That moment is a bit in a movie choking on bits - including a few good ones with Beth Grant as the battiest of all the worker bees Ben Affleck as a bartender with a curly wig and a dim J.K. Simmons with no wig at all. All we have here are bits so many in fact that ""Extract feels more like a collection of crumbs. Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet On several occasions in his new comedy Extract writer-director Mike Judge cuts to a simple establishing shot of a sports-bar exterior nestled within the hulking mass of a local Marriott. Every time we see that shot it means that Extracts hero the exasperated owner of a small extract factory has decided to slink away from his life in defeat. Whenever the shot recurs the audience feels a little piece of his soul die. Nobody is better at capturing the crushing banality of everyday life than Judge who in three live-action films has compiled a massive clip reel of suburban despair In cubicles on La-Z-Boys or in their choice of chain eateries his characters suck down soda from two-liter bottles order pizza shooters from overeager flair-flecked waiters or tune into the ultimate in mind-numbingly lowbrow entertainment like Ow My Balls or the masturbation channel. Judges camera just naturally gravitates to the most hilariously base images it can find. Ten years after Office Space flopped in theaters only to find the passionate following it deserved down the line Extract finds Judge returning triumphantly to the workplace comedy. As with Ron Livingston in Office Space and Luke Wilson in Idiocracy Judge centers the film around a put-upon everyman played here by Jason Bateman who watches his small universe collapse at his feet. Though his extract business is successful enough to win him a nice house and a pending takeover offer from General Mills hes having problems on two separate fronts. His sexual frustration at home leads him to make the drastic decision--encouraged by his dimwitted bartender (Ben Affleck in top form)--to hire a gigolo to seduce his wife (Kristen Wiig) so he wont feel guilty about cheating on her. Bateman is unaware however that the object of his desire a fetching new temp played by Mila Kunis is actually a con artist using her feminine charms to sabotage his business. The plotting in Extract is loose even by Judges standards leading to the same third-act problems that plagued Office Space and Idiocracy; in fact he shows so little interest in tying the plot strands together that a character wonders aloud about an element that never paid off. If he had the option it seems likely that Judge would just throw together 90 minutes of comic observation and leave it at that. Until then the impressive sum of domestic and workaday laughs in unruly movies like Extract will have to do.

Extract Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2009) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/extract-2009,200,extract23,extract,rogerebert
"Extract | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; extract ) Extract (United States 2009) September 01 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli After the indignity visited upon his previous feature Idiocracy one can forgive writer/director Mike Judges a certain mistrust of distributors. However while the dump-and-run approach utilized by 20th Century Fox in 2006 is not in evidence here neither has Miramax Films rolled out the red carpet for Extract. The film is making its way into a decent number of theaters but the marketing campaign is minimal and it is being released on one of the two least appealing weekends of the year. Extract is no masterpiece but its considerably better than many 2009 films that have received a more robust backing. The problem with the film is that as satires go this one has blunt teeth. Its funny but not as funny as it should be. The jokes often provoke knowing chuckles but theres a sense that opportunities for hilarity are being bypassed. Judge connects for a single when the potential is there for a double or a home run. The best parts of Extract are those that dissect every day commonplace elements the chatty next door neighbor the dynamics of the sexless marriage the banality of the workplace. The films more plot-driven aspects are less compelling and too obviously artificial. Joel (Jason Bateman) is one of those guys who seems to have it all a beautiful house (with an in-ground pool) an attractive wife and the presidency of his own company. But Joel isnt happy. His wife Suzie (Kristen Wiig) is more interested in watching Dancing with the Stars than having sex with him. He finds the day-to-day business of running his flavor extract assembly line to be tedious. And the pool is badly in need of a cleaning. Then just as Joel and his partner (J.K. Simmons) are being courted for a buyout by General Mills a workplace accident fells floor manager-in-training Step (Clifton Collins Jr.) leaving him with one testicle fewer than he started. Initially Step is disinclined to sue but outside pressure causes him to change his mind. Meanwhile Joel becomes infatuated with new employee Cindy (Mila Kunis) a con-woman whose agenda is more complicated than it initially seems. Joel wants to have an affair with Cindy but he doesnt want the guilt of being unfaithful to Suzie. His bartender friend Dean (Ben Affleck) offers a solution hire a gigolo to seduce Suzie first then after she has broken her vows he can pursue Cindy. While under the influence of drugs and booze Joel thinks this is a great idea. When hes sober however its not as appealing - but by then its too late. The films better performances come from secondary players. As leading man Joel Jason Bateman displays the kind of ineffectual blandness Judge wants from him but the character is as likely to be frustrating as endearing. Kristin Wiig isnt given much to do although the overt weirdness she displays in many of her roles is arrested here. Shes pretty normal although her voice retains its trademark cadence. Mila Kunis is gorgeous but underused. Several extraneous scenes displaying Cindys adeptness at theft appear to have been added just to give Kunis additional screen time. Theres not much of a spark between her and Bateman but this isnt a romantic comedy so thats not a detraction. The scene-stealers are Ben Affleck Clifton Collins Jr. and David Koechner. Affleck who has gradually been rebuilding his damaged reputation by appearing in under-the-radar films gives a wonderful turn as the bartender who believes Xanax is the cure for everything including the common cold. Collins Jr. provides surprising depth for a character that was likely two-dimensional on the written page. And Koechner is scarily good as the annoying talkative neighbor. (Extract provides a wonderfully wicked twist to this minor subplot.) Extract is being released Labor Day weekend because its a throwaway - arguably a little too good to go directly to video but not good enough to compete in a more crowded market. As satires go its amusing but doesnt offer much thats biting or clever. It works on its own low-key terms and is not unpleasant to sit through but that could be considered damning with faint praise. And although its not as consistently smirk-inducing as Idiocracy its almost guaranteed to be seen by more people so thats a silver lining for Judge.

SimmonsMiramax Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (Sam Urdank) C+ Extract Genre Comedy; Starring Jason Bateman Kristen Wiig Mila Kunis Ben Affleck J.K. Simmons; Director Mike Judge; Author Mike Judge; Release Date Wide 09/04/2009; Runtime (in minutes) 89; Distributor Miramax Posted September 2 2009 -- 1200 AM EDT The mass of men wrote Henry David Thoreau lead lives of quiet desperation. You could debate whether that statement is still true -- or maybe more true -- in the age of cozy fat armchairs and giant-screen TVs. But its certainly true this year in one breed of late-summer movie the masochistic comedy of everyday jerkdom in which we behold the flailing of losers who are really us. Extract and Big Fan both feature small-fry heroes who dont act so much as they get acted upon. True neither one of these men is particularly quiet. But that hardly makes them any less desperate. Couldnt Mike Judge with his acid wit have come up with a better title for a suburban-schlub comedy than ?Extract? The title refers to the company owned by Joel (Jason Bateman) who bottles ""natural"" food sweetener on a mini-factory assembly line that hes on the verge of selling to General Mills. The plan gets squashed when one of his workers (Clifton Collins Jr.) loses a testicle ?in a freak industrial accident. The worker decides to sue mostly at the prompting of Cindy (Mila Kunis) a sociopathic hottie. The weirdest thing about Extract is that the small-business chicanery isnt even Joels main problem. That would be his wife (Kristen Wiig) who draws her sweatpants tight with chastity-belt precision. Joel plans to relieve his sexual frustration by sleeping with Cindy but he must first absolve his guilt by hiring a dumb gigolo (Dustin Milligan) to seduce his wife a plan that ends up working a little too well. I love Mike Judges cartoons (King of the Hill Beavis and Butt-Head) and Idiocracy (2006) his unfairly dumped future-shock satire had flashes of demented brilliance. But didnt Judge realize that Extract with its plastic setups and one-dimensional harpies plays like Kevin Smith remaking a bad George Segal comedy from 1978? There are a handful of fun moments. Judge has Joel take one of the longest bong hits in movie history and he casts Ben Affleck in terrifying hair as a pill-popping medicine chest of a bartender. (Affleck is the one actor on screen who looks like hes having fun.) But theres something didactic overly programmed about the middle-class misery of Extract. Its not just the characters lives that are stifled -- so is Judges spontaneity as a filmmaker. Big Fan the first movie directed as well ?as written by Robert Siegel (who wrote The ?Wrestler) stars Patton Oswalt as a 35-year-old Staten Island parking-garage attendant who has no life apart from his fervid devotion to the New York Giants. The movie is an unblinking look at the hidden (or perhaps not so ? hidden) pathology of American sports mania in which the power and victory of your team becomes the sole conduit for your self-worth. Oswalts Paul sits in his parking booth then arrives back at the house he shares with his mother to call the Sports Dog radio phone-in show. There he spouts the ""spontaneous"" Go Giants Eagles suck rant he has already scrawled on a legal pad. Oswalt looking like a mild dwarfish Michael Moore makes ?Paul an unnervingly rational nut a spokesman for the ""wholesome"" addiction our all-sports-all-the-time culture has become. After Paul spots the Giants superstar linebacker he tails him to a strip club and ends up getting beaten up by his idol -- an event that youd think would leave him furious. But it only heightens the cultishness of his worship; Paul it turns out loves the Giants more than he loves himself. Big Fan while it holds us right up to the suspenseful simmer of its nerd?Taxi Driver climax doesnt go where youd expect. Thats what makes Siegel more than Judge a born filmmaker.

Extract Fair to good Director Mike Judge. Cast Jason Bateman Kristen Wiig Ben Affleck. Rating R for language sexual references and drug use. Related Bateman grateful for Arrested development Mike Judge putting the flavor of Office Space into Extract form After stealing hearts for years Mila Kunis plays a thief in Extract R-rated comedies Small wonder then that there are cartoonish aspects to ""Extract"" Judges latest film. A curious combination of workplace comedy and midlife crisis its not as good as his best work - the characters are too one-dimensional - but the laughs are generous and genuine. Jason Bateman plays Joel the owner of a food-extract plant. As he did the rows of cubicles in ""Office Space"" Judge mines the plants production floor for comedy that will be familiar to anyone who has ever had a job. But Judge also has us follow Joel home where his lackluster nearly sexless marriage to Suzie (Kristen Wiig) leaves him frustrated. He makes regular trips to a bar to lament to his slacker friend Dean (Ben Affleck) whose standard remedy for any of lifes problems can be whittled down to one word drugs. In short Joes having a midlife crisis. Which is probably the worst time possible for con artist Cindy (Mila Kunis) to enter his life. Back at the plant lazy Mary (Beth Grant) spends her hours railing against the lack of productivity by everyone else. She also has a wide streak of prejudice blaming new employee Hector (Javier Gutierrez) for a host of problems from goofing off to theft. A bizarre accident leaves would-be floor manager Step (Clifton Collins Jr.) shall we say half the man he used to be. Cindy sees dollar signs and encourages him to sue the plant which would bankrupt it. Meanwhile Dean offers Joel a bizarre suggestion for making it morally OK to cheat on Suzie involving a minor-league gigolo (Dustin Milligan) so stupid he makes Beavis look like Einstein in comparison. The story as you may have gathered isnt the films greatest strength except for this As fans of Judges early short ""Frog Baseball"" know he isnt afraid to exercise his dark side. Thats true as well of ""Extract"" where some of the things that just dont happen in these kinds of movies actually do. Things dont add up completely but the performances forgive a lot. Bateman has perfected the long-suffering straight-man role since his work on ""Arrested Development."" Hes not far from that here. J.K. Simmons is dependably funny as the impatient plant boss who wont memorize his employees names. And David Koechner steals all his scenes as the most annoying neighbor since the Jethro and Granny moved in next door to Mr. Drysdale. Gene Simmons is way over-the-top as an ambulance-chasing lawyer but really when you cast Gene Simmons do you expect anything else? In the best comedies we identify with the plight of the put-upon the unlucky the down-on-their-luck. Here not so much. We laugh at them not with them which would have been more satisfying. But at least we laugh a lot. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter goodyk.

"Extract movie review by Roger Moore - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Extract -- 3 out of 5 stars Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Mike Judge finds humor in the lone sane person swimming against a tide of idiots. That formula worked for umpteen years on King of the Hill and it still works well enough in his workplace comedy Extract. Judge fills the screen with rubes klutzes and jerks. Then he hurls them at poor Jason Bateman. Extract is a real tour de force for Bateman who finally has a big-screen role that plays to his Arrested Development strength -- a guy dismayed at how moronic those around him can be. He plays Joel a self-made man a successful bottler of vanilla almond and assorted other flavoring ""extracts"" a guy who knows his employees who range from infantile and delusional all the way to incompetent. But theres hope. General Mills might take the company off his hands. Theres less hope at home. Each day Joel races there from work or the sports bar at the Marriott Courtyard where Dean ( Ben Affleck hilarious) the stoner bartender hears him whine about a wife ( Kristen Wiig) who dons sweat pants each night at 8 taking sex off the evenings itinerary.If only he could cheat. If only shed cheat first. A few drinks and an accidental horse tranquilizer later Joel has let Dean hook him up with a dopey gigolo (Dustin Milligan a hoot) wholl tempt the missus to stray so Joel can cheat in peace.

Hoberman Mike Judge Sides with Management in Extract Tuesday September 1 2009 at 4 a.m. By J. Hoberman 1 Whos the boss? Bateman.Miramax Film Corp/Sam Urdank A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Here for Labor Day--a comedy about the hilarity and heartbreak of running a small business. A decade after his succes destime Office Space (and a few months following the termination of his long-running animated series King of the Hill) Mike Judge returns with a complementary social satire Extract.Where Office Space was a comedy of employee disaffection Extract looks at the struggle between labor and capital from the other side of the desk. Named for flavorings produced by protagonist Joel Reynold (Jason Bateman) in his small factory Extract is sweeter than Judges scabrous and in most markets unreleased Idiocracy. Its hardly less concerned with putting a frame around stupidity--opening with an apparently ditzy babe (Mila Kunis) fleecing two music-store dudes for a pricey electric guitar--but where Idiocracy held up a grotesque mirror to American mass culture and politics Extract seems to be designed to give capitalism a human face.Batemans everyman protag is our current ideal--the successful creator of his own small business--but his life is less so. The entrepreneur is waylaid by a droning nudnik neighbor (David Koechner) each evening as he returns home from work sexually frustrated by his bored wife Suzie (SNLer Kristen Wiig) and elaborately misadvised by his best buddy Dean (Ben Affleck) a shaggy bartender who takes Xanax for a head cold. His main concern however is his plant full of brainless assembly-line workers. In the movies most choreographed set piece Joels employees effect a Rube Goldberg catastrophe that robs their stupidest member of his family jewels. Cut to gorgeous scammer Cindy (Kunis) scanning the morning paper glomming on a report on this ""testicular incident"" then showing up at the factory having hatched a plan to take Joel to the cleaners.What Judge wonders is at the root of a mans success? After an eye-batting job interview the tantalized Joel wonders how to take advantage of his fetching new employee--and at the same time feels bad about it. Helpful Dean suggests that Joel allay his own potential adulterous guilt by first tempting Suzie and to that end puts another specialist on Joels payroll--the dimwitted teenaged gigolo Brad played by Dustin Milligan with cretinous panache. Lubitsch it aint but the master would surely have approved of the twist in which hired to seduce Suzie Brad succeeds beyond his wildest dreams.Abetted by some reliable comic face-pullers (J.K. Simmons Beth Grant) Extract has its share of standard comic tropes--notably the one in which deciding that Joel needs some pharmaceutical fine-tuning Dean takes Joel to suck on a monster bong administered by a mega-dominating dope dealer. More frightening is the scene in which Joel is bedeviled by a demon-dog shyster (Gene ""Kiss"" Simmons horrifyingly resplendent in a Paganini fright wig). Joel manages to hit bottom losing his company and his wife moving into a Best Western before . . . well its a comedy. If one is inclined to analyze these things the heros fortune is largely a function of his luck and Joel more or less functions as a straight man in a world of fools.Idiocracy was notable for satirizing even as it reveled in the dumbing of America. (Once seen it provides an invaluable way to characterize the nations nightly cavalcade of cable news.) Judge must have taken the lesson of Idiocracy to heart because as Hollywood comedies go Extract is amazingly free of gross-out vulgarity. If anything its overly polite and anything but anarchic. Establishing a rhythm of workaday repetition set to a country-western backbeat the movie is characterized by its crisp cutting classical framing and comic timing. The style and approach recall classic Albert Brooks. Indeed the beleaguered cuckolded Joel would have been a great role for the young Brooks--adding a certain self-aggrandizing je ne sais quoi or a neurotic zetz that the appealing but bland Bateman lacks.jhobermanvillagevoice.com Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact J.

"Extract | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Review Extract Justin Chang Chief Film Critic JustinCChang 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr August 18 2009 | 0900PM PT Pic doesnt show writer-director Mike Judges comedic instincts at their sharpest. Substituting blue-collar blunderers for ""Office Spaces"" white-collar workhorses ""Extract"" distills meager laughs from a strange story about a cheating wife a wily thief a severed testicle and a hapless factory owner juggling all of the above. Mike Judges latest bigscreen outing finds the always interesting writer-director working in a softer less spoofy mode than usual and a few colorful supporting characters aside doesnt show his comedic instincts at their sharpest. But as his first live-action film granted the dignity of a proper wide release the Sept. 4 opener could bottle modest-to-solid returns on the names of Jason Bateman and Ben Affleck. Indeed after the poor theatrical fortunes that befell 1999s ""Office Space"" (which happily rebounded as a cult fave on homevid) and 2006s underrated futuristic farce ""Idiocracy"" its hard not to wish the best for ""Extract."" Its also hard not to wish Judges script having grounded its characters in a normal workaday setting -- a flavor-extract factory proudly run by Joel Reynold (Bateman) -- had chosen to use that setting as its primary comic motor in the manner of ""Office Space."" Initially this does seem to be Judges intent. After all employee incompetence and complacency are to blame for the horrible (and amusingly staged) assembly-line accident that causes wannabe floor manager Step (Clifton Collins Jr.) to almost become a soprano -- and not the New Jersey kind. The setback couldnt come at a worse time for Joel a hard-working mild-mannered guy whos trying to sell the business and whose own nether regions are turning blue from the chronic neglect of his chilly wife Suzie (Kristen Wiig). Enter the factorys newest hire Cindy who -- as played by ""Forgetting Sarah Marshalls"" Mila Kunis -- is such a smokin hottie especially compared with her co-workers that she immediately triggers adulterous longings in Joel. Egged on by his best friend bartender Dean (Affleck long-haired and laid-back) and with the help of some strong tranquilizers Joel enlists good-looking dimwit Brad (Dustin Milligan) to seduce Suzie which will assuage Joels guilt and free him to pursue Cindy -- who its revealed early on has her own slippery agenda. In zeroing in on a sexually frustrated small-business owner facing a major lawsuit Judge means to wring humor from a familiar vein of American male discontent. To that end he surrounds Joel with an assortment of rubes and grotesques the most memorable of which is his nightmarish neighbor Nathan (David Koechner) a balding bespectacled irritant who never knows when to shut up or go away. Pitting Koechners passive-aggressive drone against Batemans Mr. Nice Guy these agonizingly protracted sequences are the only ones that go beyond funny into squirm-inducing. Where ""Extract"" does succeed is in creating a factory environment so vivid you can almost smell the vanilla. Well lensed by Tim Suhrstedt at a water-bottling plant in Californias City of Commerce these scenes are all the more gratifying for tackling a milieu not often seen onscreen. And while they dont get much screen time Joels employees -- from a heavily pierced rock-star wannabe (T.J. Miller) to a stubborn shrew who sees everyones laziness but her own (Beth Grant) -- could inspire flashes of recognition among auds wherever they work. Otherwise the pics attempts at comic portraiture feel sketchy at best more or less assigning each character a single belabored trait -- Joels supervisor (J.K. Simmons) refuses to remember his workers names Steps lawyer (Gene Simmons) is a showboating sleaze etc. And while ""Office Space"" and ""Idiocracy"" registered as howls of outrage at corporate culture and mass stupidity respectively ""Extract"" has little of their satirical energy or underlying anger. It skewers marriage entrepreneurship and manual labor only to reaffirm them in the final stretch and in a way that doesnt feel especially bighearted (like Judges toon series ""King of the Hill"") just soft-headed. Batemans likable straight-man routine proves reliably watchable and while he and Affleck dont strike up much in the way of buddy chemistry a shared scene of massive pot inhalation does score a direct hit. But the pic again shows Judges difficulty writing female characters of substance (not that hes alone among male comedy scribes in that respect) Kunis is fine (in both senses) as a gold-digging seductress but Wiig so side-splitting in her throwaway appearances in ""Knocked Up"" and ""Ghost Town"" is given no such opportunities in an ostensibly meatier role. Tech credits are pro though George S. Clintons overworked score is of the fill-in-the-laughs variety.
