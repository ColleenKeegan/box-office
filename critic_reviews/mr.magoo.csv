Movies by Owen Gleiberman Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr F Posted January 9 1998 -- 1200 AM EST With Mr. Magoo its the filmmakers who seem blind. They dont even do a good job of making Leslie Nielsen look like Mr. Magoo the destructively nearsighted millionaire fogy. Sporting a choppy white fringe (the 60s cartoon character who is reprised in the opening and closing credits was bald) Nielsen who brought passive-aggressive bumbling to a high art in the Naked Gun pictures here suggests an escaped lunatic making up shtick as he goes along. Its no surprise that the plot which wobbles vaguely around a stolen gem a Brazilian mobster and an ugly-adorable dog is goofy dullsville but the slapstick tomfoolery turns out to be even worse. It was a disastrous decision to recruit director Stanley Tong a veteran of Jackie Chan actioners to create kiddified Rube Goldberg routines. He stages visual gags as if the camera were being operated by a forklift and the stuntmen had forgotten to show up.

Despite the abundance of slapstick and an overall skew toward younger viewers pic may hold little appeal for preteens since the original cartoon shorts are no longer in wide TV circulation. Older ticketbuyers arent likely to care much either. Expect a fast fade from theaters and only slightly longer visibility on video store shelves. In this version of the Magoo mythos Quincy Magoo (Leslie Nielsen) is a sight-impaired millionaire whos too stubborn to admit that he really really needs eyeglasses. Most of the time he can rely on his attentive nephew Waldo (Matt Keeslar) and his faithful bulldog Angus to remove the more obvious obstacles in his path. But despite the best intentions of man and beast Mr. Magoo has a habit of strolling into trouble. While presiding at the gala opening of a museum exhibit he accidentally disrupts the proceedings by cutting a power line instead of a ceremonial ribbon. Then he wanders into a mummy case -- he thinks its a telephone booth -- and assumes the inhabitant is a heavily bandaged accident victim. And so it goes. While Mr. Magoo remains in the mummy case two cat burglars enter the museum to steal the Star of Kuristan a priceless gem. Luanne Leseur (Kelly Lynch) is the brain and the beauty of the team -- thick-witted Bob Morgan (Nick Chinlund) is merely along for the ride -- and she soon has second thoughts about turning the gem over to their boss Austin Cloquet (Malcolm McDowell). But while trying to abscond with the booty Luanne accidentally turns the Star of Kuristan over to the blissfully oblivious Mr. Magoo. Magoo becomes the target of an international manhunt led by two bumbling U.S. government agents (Stephen Tobolowsky Ernie Hudson). To clear his name he enlists nephew and bulldog to help him follow a trail that leads to Cloquets ski-resort enclave and then to the Brazilian domain of arch-criminal Ortega ""The Piranha"" Peru (Miguel Ferrer). Because hes chronically unable to read signs and cant tell the difference between a paddlewheel and an escalator Mr. Magoo repeatedly places himself and those around him in grave danger. Each time he does however fate luck or screenwriting contrivance intervene. To be fair it should be noted that a few gags here have little or nothing to do with near-sightedness. Unfortunately given the recent career history of pics star too many of these bits play like outtakes from ""Naked Gun"" comedies. Nielsen offers yet another variation on what has become his signature persona an indefatigably self-assured bumbler. And though its difficult to think of a more appropriate way to play this character as written Nielsens shtick is getting stale. Still the veteran actor goes through his paces energetically enough and gives more to the pic than it ever gives him. Screenwriters Pat Proft and Tom Sherohman have labored mightily to cobble together a plot capable of stretching to feature length the one-joke premise of the six-minute cartoons. At 87 minutes however ""Mr. Magoo"" feels padded and repetitious. Even more disappointingly director Stanley Tong (""Supercop"" ""Rumble in the Bronx"") fails to infuse pic with the high-spirited exuberance that prevailed in his Hong Kong action-adventures with Jackie Chan. Lynch provides a few bright moments of impressive physicality and first-rate comic timing as Luanne. Other supporting players rise to the demands of the material -- that is they dont knock themselves out. Pic is bracketed by animated sequences that have Greg Burson filling in for the late Jim Backus as the voice of Mr. Magoo. Other tech credits are routine. Closing credits begin with an apologetic announcement Nothing in ""Mr. Magoo"" should be interpreted as ""an accurate portrayal of blindness or poor eyesight."" No kidding.

Comments Mr. Magoo If you really hate your kids pack them off to this slapdash farce whose only funny moment is the PC disclaimer at the end about the Disney companys humanist concern for blind people (which even literate toddlers will have trouble understanding anyway). Leslie Nielsen seems a good two feet too tall for the unlamented UPA cartoon character of the 50s (who had a barely seen cartoon feature of his own back in 1964) but the real problems go beyond that. Director Stanley Tong (Supercop Rumble in the Bronx Jackie Chans First Strike) gets to recapture his Hong Kong action routines only in the abbreviated kickboxing assigned to Kelly Lynch or her stunt double; everything else is torturous formula. Written by Pat Proft and Tom Sherohman; with Malcolm McDowell Ernie Hudson Stephen Tobolowsky and Miguel Ferrer (looking and sounding a great deal like his father Jose).

This schizoid stab at comedy is bracketed at beginning and end by animation that resurrects the severely myopic supremely self-confident blundering gasbag of the popular UPA cartoons of the 1960s. But shortly after it begins Mr. Magoo trots out Leslie Nielsen as the live version of the old fool. Then apparently because the charm of a one-joke character created for short films is unsustainable over feature length Mr. Magoo decides to have a go at comic adventure. Poor old Mr. Magoo should have been allowed to rest in piece. This film suggests that when you loot a crypt youre likely to find a corpse. Neither the writers Pat Proft and Tom Sherohman nor Stanley Tong the director who came out of Hong Kong to direct Jackie Chan vehicles like Rumble in the Bronx and Supercop manage to breathe life into the Magoo of the 1990s. Yes he still cant see well enough to drive safely. He mistakes the decorations on a womans hat for canapes at a black tie party. He locks himself inside a sarcophagus thinking it is a phone booth. He spends a good deal of time tossing a priceless ruby into his topiary in the belief that the gem is a plaything for his bulldog Angus who is the films liveliest most interesting character. The ruby known as the Star of Kuristan is the fuel that drives the movie. Stolen just after Magoo as an eggplant-canning factory magnate and patron of the arts has dedicated a new museum wing housing the jewel it is accidentally dropped into his fishing tackle box. The thief is Luanne (Kelly Lynch) a deceitful cat burglar watched over by Bob Morgan (Nick Chinlund) a clumsy henchman employed by Austin Cloquet (Malcolm McDowell) who has hired Luanne and is planning to sell the ruby at a convention of the worlds great criminals. Before Mr. Magoo comes to an end two feuding F.B.I. and C.I.A. operatives (Stephen Tobolowsky and Ernie Hudson) have decided that Magoo is the thief; Luanne pretends to fall for Magoo in an effort to find the ruby; Magoos helpful nephew Waldo (Matt Keeslar) is smitten with Kuristans lovely representative (Jennifer Garner) and Magoo not only masquerades as a deadly criminal named Peru but also travels to Brazil to find Peru. (Its a geography joke.) Mr. Tong whose specialty is action makes the last portion of the film involving the criminals convention the intervention of the authorities and the showdown with Peru in Brazil move at a lively pace when it is not slowing down to search for comedy in an encounter between Magoo and a mandrill he mistakes for a child. Incomplete as a cartoon indecisive as comedy halting as adventure Mr. Magoo turns out to be a shortsighted project. Mr. Magoo is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It contains some menace and mayhem. MR.

MAGOO Comedy. Starring Leslie Nielsen Kelly Lynch Ernie Hudson Stephen Tobolowsky Malcolm McDowell. Directed by Stanley Tong. (PG. 85 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Mr. Magoo"" opens today but they should have left well enough alone. Only a couple of good gags in its pileup of otherwise lame jokes keep the production from being an unqualified stinker. Leslie Nielsen at 71 may be the only big-name comic actor able to translate the bumbling well-meaning Magoo from animation (voiced by the late Jim Backus) to live action. With his deft timing and admirable wryness Nielsen almost pulls it off. But the corny inept script by Pat Proft and Tom Sherohman keeps tripping up his efforts. The films cheesy low-budget look -- the kind that costs millions -- doesnt help. ""Magoos"" best moments dont feature Nielsen -- theyre in the animated title sequences showing the squinting clueless Magoo inadvertently creating disasters everywhere he goes. His antics are a wonderful reminder of why ""Mr. Magoo"" a cartoon created in 1949 was such a winner. LIVE ACTION A DRAG When the film shifts to live action things start to break down right away. Enter Nielsen with bald pate and white-haired fringe. His Quincy Magoo a bumbling nearsighted millionaire steps out in natty attire to drive around in a cherry red vintage Studebaker convertible. At first it looks as if the 90s may do the old gent proud. The first joke has him eating fruit from a womans hat. But the sight -- or sightless -- gags wear thin fast and ""Mr. Magoo"" takes a long boring downhill slide. Directed by Hong Kongs Stanley Tong (""Rumble in the Bronx"" ""Supercop"") a former stuntman the film has only a couple of crowd- pleasing stunts one involving an ironing board used as a snowboard another a wacky museum burglary. Magoo gets caught up in trying to recover an enormous ruby stolen from a museum. Even when he has the gem in his hands he cant see it so he tosses the rock to his faithful English bulldog Angus to retrieve. LYNCH HAS FIRE The main villain is played by Kelly Lynch (""Drugstore Cowboy"") whose Luanne is a ruthless kung fu ace. Lynch is the one fiery fun character -- shes appealing throughout and her kicks have a genuine fury that nudges the film away from its contrived doddering tone. Her accomplice is a dolt named Bob (Nick Chinlund). Other bright lights are Stephen Tobolowsky (""Groundhog Day"") playing an FBI agent and Ernie Hudson (""The Basketball Diaries"") in an engaging turn as a CIA man. Miguel Ferrer plays a mobster and the resilient Malcolm McDowell plays a crime kingpin. Kids may get a kick out of the dog Angus -- he has his own potty.
