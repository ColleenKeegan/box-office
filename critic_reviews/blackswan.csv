Fox Searchlight Pictures Natalie Portman and Vincent Cassel in ""Black Swan"" (Fox Searchlight Pictures) Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) is a ballerina who strives for perfection and invariably achieves it -- at least from a technical perspective. But she has a problem with losing herself in the moment. And thats standing in the way of her latest goal dancing the principal roles in ""Swan Lake.""Clearly Nina has what it takes to portray the dainty White Swan. But Thomas (Vincent Cassel) artistic director of the ballet company doubts that shes up to the challenge of the dangerous Black Swan. It doesnt help that Nina feels the world closing in on her. At home shes forced to cope with the mood swings of her overprotective mother (Barbara Hershey). At the studio Nina faces potential competition from Lily (Mila Kunis) who is as uninhibited as Nina is uptight -- and would definitely make an intriguing Black Swan.As the pressure builds up so do Ninas fears and fantasies. Which raises the question Is she losing her mind? ""Black Swan"" is ridiculously over the top but in a way that makes it fascinating to watch. Working from a screenplay by Andres Heinz Mark Heyman and John McLaughlin director Darren Aronofsky (""The Wrestler"") piles on the weirdness with such obvious relish that the experience verges on the operatic. His previous films including ""Pi"" and ""Requiem for a Dream"" hinted at a flair for the hysterical that ""Black Swan"" fully embraces. If Aronofsky takes things a bit too far hes also bold enough to go with his gut.Portman hasnt been this good since her early performances in ""The Professional"" and ""Heat"" and is deservedly attracting intense Oscar buzz. Kunis brings to Lily a savvy sexiness and Cassel is entertainingly smarmy.As unsettling as it is stylish ""Black Swan"" may do for ballet what ""Jaws"" did for beaches.

REVIEW Portmans portrayal of unstable dancer puts her in Oscar contention Pressure is a funny thing.

BOTTOM LINE Creepy freaky fun CAST Natalie Portman Mila Kunis Barbara Hershey DIRECTOR Darren Aronofsky WHEN/WHERE Find showtimes and tickets for ""Black Swan"" LENGTH 150 Practice makes perfectly insane in ""Black Swan"" a tale of one ballerinas psychosexual freakout. Its thoroughly bizarre pitched at high C and as you might expect from a movie about a crazy person in a tutu frequently hilarious. Thanks to director Darren Aronofsky (""The Wrestler"") its also audacious and inventive a rare example of a film that wants to explore what films can do. Possibly the only movie to make Lincoln Center look like Draculas Castle ""Black Swan"" focuses on Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) a technically dazzling but emotionally stunted ballerina. Her director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) has cast her in the demanding dual role of the virginal White Swan and the predatory Black Swan in Tchaikovskys ""Swan Lake."" advertisement | advertise on newsday But he has some reservations ""I never see you lose yourself"" Thomas says which is director-ese for ""you need to sleep with me."" Still he makes a valid point The sexually inexperienced Nina is more girl than woman. Shes also surrounded by women from her infantilizing mother (Barbara Hershey) to her bombshell rival (Mila Kunis). Gradually Ninas unstable world comes apart. Bloody cracks appear in her body and her face shows up on other peoples heads. Aronofskys symbolism isnt exactly subtle (look for lots of mirrors and swans) but he squeezes maximum shivers out of near-subliminal imagery and sound. Some of the films most wicked frights last only a split second. Ninas main hang-up - and perhaps the filmmakers as well - is her virginity. Like Catherine Deneuves sheltered little murderer in Roman Polanskis ""Repulsion"" (1965) Portmans bottled-up ballerina is in the throes of what doctors once called female hysteria. By the time this fever-dream of a movie breaks you might know the feeling.

Black Swan (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Black Swan (R) Ballet slippers tutus and nightmares Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald12/16/2010 Editor rating 3.5 Black Swan the fifth (and best) film by director Darren Aronofsky is something of a summation of the filmmakers previous work. Theres the mind-bending enigma of Pi and The Fountain; the harrowing horror of Requiem for a Dream; and the detailed exploration of a profession that requires athleticism and precision like The Wrestler. Even though Aronofsky didnt write Black Swan (the screenplay is credited to Mark Heyman Andres Heinz and John J. McLaughlin) and even though the story of a fragile ballerina seems like the last thing youd expect him to direct Black Swan still feels like a project tailor-made for the filmmakers strengths. The movie offers little in terms of plot The young Nina (Natalie Portman) formerly a company dancer lands the lead role of the Swan Queen in a new production of Swan Lake by her director Thomas (Vincent Cassel) but with one condition She has the innocence and naivete of the white swan down pat but must work at drawing out the sexuality and seductive power of her evil twin the black swan. The film opens with a dream an obvious warning that not everything you are about to see is actually happening and we soon share one of Ninas paranoid hallucinations which informs us there is something not quite right about this polite tremulous young woman. Her mom Erica (Barbara Hershey) treats her in an almost childlike manner that suggests a variety of things Is something wrong with Nina? Is Erica living out her failed ballet aspirations through her daughter? Is her motherly love suffocating Nina to a dangerous extreme? There is also Lily (Mila Kunis) a beautiful dancer at the company who befriends Nina - and happens to have a pair of black wings tattooed on her back. Lily is carefree and open sexually liberated and impetuous - all the qualities Nina needs to find in herself to properly play the role. But is Lily a real person or just an extrapolation of whom Nina longs to be? Does she envy or hate her? Does Lily even exist? Aronofsky resorts to hoary tricks in Black Swan such as the symbolic use of color (pay attention to who is always dressed in black for example) or the sudden shocking hallucination (like Nina picking at her cuticle and tearing off a chunk of her finger). But theyre all in the service of a unique and feverish vision one that is influenced by The Red Shoes as much as Repulsion. Rarely have mental disorders been portrayed so spectacularly or with such suspense. It is impossible to predict what is going to happen in Black Swan because the film is unfolding through the eyes of a most unreliable narrator who cant separate real from imagined. Portman saddled with the near-impossible role of an impenetrable heroine we must care for without ever coming close to understanding delivers career-high work here Black Swan wouldnt work without her performance a combination of profound vulnerability and frightened bewilderment. But is there something darker lurking underneath? Aronofsky sometimes makes things visually literal like when Ninas eyes turn blood red or a startling physical transformation that is beautiful and horrifying at the same time. The sound design is just as critical like the erotic moan faintly heard when Nina opens a tube of luscious red lipstick. Theres a touch of Mulholland Drive in the films refusal to close all its circles and this kind of storytelling is not for everyone. But Aronofsky takes some huge artistic risks here with Portman at his side and they pay off with haunting unnerving effect. Elegant perverse and frightening Black Swan is understandably a love-hate proposition. But either way  prepare to be thinking about it for days.

Natalie Portman stars as the obsessively dedicated emotionally stunted and perhaps going crazy ballerina Nina Sayers in ""Black Swan.""

While I enthusiastically vote the latter its no surprise that many viewers will be torn when it comes to director Darren Aronofskys perversely magnificent psychological thriller starring an undaunted Natalie Portman as a ballerina who gets the part of a lifetime -- the Swan Queen and her dark double -- if only she can keep it together. ""Black Swan"" is at once serious and silly absurd and artistically stunning engaged and wildly boneheaded. The screenplay -- penned by Mark Heyman Andres Heinz and John McLaughlin -- mixes a cocktail of sources. Among them Roman Polanskis plunge into female hysteria ""Repulsion""; Joseph L. Mankiewiczs ""All About Eve""; and Aronofskys own performance drama ""The Wrestler."" Composer Peter Ilyich Tchaikovskys 19th-century ballet ""Swan Lake"" of course took fairy tales of enchantment and dark magic as its foundation. And fairy tales themselves represent the tortured and twisted fears and wants of we poor humans. Obsessively dedicated emotionally stunted Nina Sayers (Portman) has a shot at moving from the ballet corps to a soloist role. The New York ballet company lorded over by artistic director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) has an aging prima ballerina (Winona Ryder) and plummeting subscriptions. Whom will he promote? The technically gifted Nina or fiercely spirited newcomer Lily portrayed with carnal ease by Mila Kunis? Ninas a perfect fit as the Swan Queen but too rigid for the Black Swan. From the start Ninas anxiety is high. She appears to spy her double more than once. She gnaws her cuticles ruthlessly. Or does she? This teetering is central to the movies allure. The pas de deux between Ninas story and the ""Swan Lake"" characters is vital and hallucinatory. And theres little straightforward about ""Black Swan"" which enters the ranks of fine films in which the protagonists madness is mirrored by the films unfolding narrative. Portman gives a performance that feels as powerfully unhinged as it is deeply disciplined. Thats the idea. Will Ninas rise be breakthrough or breakdown? Frenemies abound beginning arguably with Ninas mother Erica with whom Nina lives. After a day of back-breaking toenail splintering work the 20-something returns to a room of stuffed animals and pink fabrics. Its not pretty and production designer Therese DePrez goes all out. Barbara Hersey portrays the retired ballerina and concerned mother. Is she a zealous protector or jealous rival? And what of Lily -- friend or foe kind or conniving? Whichever Kunis makes for a likeable onscreen presence. Yet another alum of ""That 70s Show"" she proves what a unbelievably good eye that slight television series casting folk had. French actor Cassel is erotically charged as the manipulative visionary artistic director who dumps embittered ballerina Beth Macintyre in search of a new ""princess."" In order to be sublime ""Black Swan"" risks being ridiculous. The filmmaking is often devastating. Matthew Libatiques camerawork Dan Schreckers visual effects and Andrew Weisblums editing allow for dramatic unblinking fantastical transformations. Composer Clint Mansells score entwines with Tchaikovskys looming glorious notes. Yet Aronofsky and his writers revisit not particularly updated notions about female sexuality in terms of hysteria and frigidity the transit from Girl to Woman via lesbian desire and heterosexual sex. At times ""Black Swan"" verges on laughably old school. Still what a brazen bold riff on the cost -- physical emotional -- of art. With ""The Wrestler"" Aronofsky revealed and identified with the battered brutal not entirely bogus artistry of Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson. Why not embrace a ballerinas belief in that all too discounted state called ""transcendence"" in that cruely elusive prize ""perfection""?

Black Swan  1/2 Director Darren Aronofsky. Cast Natalie Portman Mila Kunis Vincent Cassel. Rating R for sexual content violent images language and drug use. Note At Harkins Camelview. Great Good Fair Bad Bomb Either you embrace its headlong descent into madness brought on by the pressures of artistic perfection compounded by smothering anxiety or you reject it. Its that simple. Darren Aronofskys film about Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) a ballerina struggling to find the freedom of expression needed to fully embody a role is willfully over the top an exercise in overstatement that will leave you exhilarated and spent or rolling your eyes. Aronofsky all but demands that you give yourself to the movie with the same commitment the director of ""Swan Lake"" demands of his dancer. My advice Give in. Taken in the too-much-is-never-enough vein ""Black Swan"" is a fantastic experience a horror movie where the scares may be in Ninas head a far scarier setting than where most thrillers take place. Nina dances in a New York City company whose autocratic artistic director Thomas Leroy (a fantastic Vincent Cassel) has decided to put a new spin on the classics for the season. This entails among other things jettisoning his prima ballerina and lover Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder) whose dismissal from both roles illustrates Leroys cold calculating manner. He is starting the new season with ""Swan Lake"" and he reluctantly decides on Nina for the lead. Its not her talent that gives him pause. The shy technically proficient Nina is perfect for the role of the White Swan. But she must also embody the darker sensuality of the Black Swan and its not clear she has that duality in her. Even among the obsessives in the ballet world Nina stands out. Her mother Erica (Barbara Hershey) a former dancer has devoted both her life and Ninas to making Nina a star. Her love and ambition regarding her daughter is smothering; in the apartment they share Nina is still a little girl surrounded in her girlie-girl bedroom by stuffed animals a ballerina jewelry box on the nightstand. Ericas passive-aggressive support and criticism is damaging to Nina. Dance - Ninas dancing - is their lives. There is nothing else. Nina is sheltered almost literally a serious shortcoming if she is to dance the Black Swan and an insurmountable obstacle if she is to have a normal life. Enter Lily (Mila Kunis) a new dancer who while not as technically good a dancer as Nina embodies everything the Black Swan should be smoldering dangerous with an almost intimidating sexuality. The ever-manipulative Vincent orchestrates an awkward friendship between the two yet Nina is threatened. She has found her rival. The pressure is crippling. Nina grows paranoid. She people and things that arent there - or are they? Talk of previously injuring herself is ominous and the pattern of behavior seems to be repeated. Nina peels off skin fingernails bleeds begins to grow what look like wings. The person she sees in the mirror is not always her. What is real? What is taking place in Ninas imagination? To Aronofskys credit we dont get to know. An Ecstasy-fueled night out with Lily turns surreal and more. Is it the drugs? The pressure? There are so many people Nina must satisfy - Leroy her mother herself. Comparisons to Aronofskys ""The Wrestler"" are apt in that he expertly captures the maniacal dedication required for such physically brutal performances. But here he goes further - much further - both visually and psychologically. Darkly beautiful at times almost comically intense and sometimes just out-and-out crazy ""Black Swan"" is a film that demands much of its audience (to say nothing of its cast) yet offers rewards in even greater measure.

Artificial slope to open at Buck Hill this fall next Movies 111615784 Ballet meets noir in Black Swan ""Swan"" is a thoughtful work of art with the giddy urgency of a slasher flick.  |  1/2 out of 4 stars By Colin Covert Star Tribune December 10 2010 -- 249pm Provided by Fox Searchlight Fox Searchlight Natalie Portman is an obsessed dancer pirouetting out of control. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Movie horror comes in many forms scary sex scenes frightening monsters and mental terrors. But some of the most haunting horror stories arent merely terrifying theyre achingly sad. ""Black Swan"" starring Natalie Portman as a lovely ingenue losing her footing combines all those strands into a terrific profoundly disturbing tapestry of suspense and madness. As its protagonist transforms herself to embody the schizoid heroine of ""Swan Lake"" the film picks at our deepest anxieties -- injury disfigurement loss of a coveted job loss of identity loss of sanity. In most fright films danger lurks in the shadows. Here its grinning from a mirror. Portman plays Nina a dancer in a fictional New York City company who is completely consumed by ballet. Shy virginal still under the thumb of her domineering stage mother (Barbara Hershey) she is an accomplished but over-controlled dancer. Her artistic director Thomas (played with great gusto by Vincent Cassel) urges her to loosen up. Unless she can express the wild dark sensuality of the Swan Queens alter ego known as the Black Swan she will never win the iconic part. But Nina clings to her obsessive self-discipline. Its what keeps her from spinning out of balance. The deeper she delves into the role the harder she strains to differentiate between the dance companys backstage treacheries and the sinister world of her own imagination. Each pirouette adds to her downward spiral. From this unusual premise director Darren Aronofsky (""The Wrestler"") fashions an excellent thoughtful work of art with the giddy urgency of a slasher movie. Using a handheld camera Aronofsky shoots intense intimate close-ups that hold the characters in a clinch. In tightly framed shots of Nina performing we dont see her dancing so much as her absorption in it -- the concentration of a professional who has become almost selfless. As the camera moves acrobatically through the performance we experience Ninas ecstatic abandon. And when her grip on reality loosens Aronofskys camera recoils in horror along with his heroine. Portmans performance as the psychologically disintegrating dancer is beyond praise. Her worry guilt and grief are so potent theyre nearly unbearable. Ninas not all that articulate which makes Portmans accomplishment all the more impressive. She has to communicate volumes through expression alone and she carries it off brilliantly. BLACK SWAN  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for strong sexual content disturbing violent images language and some drug use. Where Uptown. When the actress gifts mesh with the directors ""Black Swan"" is at its best. Aronofsky has plenty of tricks up his own sleeve of course. At one point during a passionate sex scene special-effects goosebumps subtly brush across Ninas thigh. Its a tiny thing but perfectly suited to the story of a repressed young woman who fears she is being possessed by a bird. Details like that add a bright spot of unease to an already disquieting story. The film teases our expectations before it sweeps our legs out from beneath us. Nina fancies herself a persecuted maiden and were encouraged to accept her self-assessment but then it begins to slip away. The French-born Cassel promises to be a debonair manipulative sex bandit using the dancers as his personal harem. By the time the film is over we have an entirely different understanding of the impresario as a man whose driving lust is artistic not carnal. The same goes for smoky-voiced Mila Kunis as a rival dancer who may be undermining Ninas career. With her insinuating manner she appears to be a standard mean girl in toe shoes. As the film progresses we wonder how many of her hostile acts occurred and how many are Ninas projections. Theres an emotional richness to the film that balances against its stark monochromatic palette. Nina is as human as real people we know even as she succumbs to the worlds worst case of bird flu. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

One thing you can say about Darren Aronofsky You never know what hes going to do next. A through-line connecting his movies to one another would read like a 2008 stock-market graph. There was Pi a grainy black-and-white thriller about a Jewish math prodigy; then Requiem for a Dream a hyper-stylized melodrama about drug addicts in New York City; then The Fountain a grandiose metaphysical nut-out with a time-traveling Hugh Jackman in pursuit of the fountain of youth; and then The Wrestler a gritty realist tale about the redemption of a burned-out athlete. That Aronofskys next project would be a psychological horror movie about a disturbed ballerina seemed no more or less logical than the notion that hed adapt Bleak House as a 3-D musical. The Wrestler is the only one of Aronofskys films Ive really liked but I approach each new one with fresh excitement Though his movies can be risibly off-kilter Aronofsky is a filmmaker of ambition energy and scope--a guy whose reach has a way of thrillingly exceeding his grasp. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The reach/grasp ratio is way off inBlack Swan(FoxSearchlight) a movie that combines some truly stunning visual and cinematic ideas with some truly terrible well ideas. Yet the conceit at its heart is not unpromising. Like the uber-ballet movie of all time Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburgers The Red Shoes Black Swan is a dark fairy tale about a ballerina who risks being destroyed by an all-consuming role. Nina (Natalie Portman) is a dancer in the corps of a company thats never quite named as the New York City Ballet. The companys director Thomas (Vincent Cassel) a sadistic womanizer whos clearly meant to recall NYCB founder George Balanchine is casting a production of Swan Lake that will apparently reinvent the Tchaikovsky chestnut from the ground up. (How it will do that were never told. Though Aronofsky fetishizes tulle tutus and close-ups of bleeding feet he seems remarkably uninterested in actual dancing and what choreography we do see looks pretty conventional.) Advertisement Nina after a respectable but undistinguished career as a low-ranking dancer desperately covets the lead in Swan Lake a demanding part in which the same dancer must play the innocent white swan Odette and her wicked black double Odile. But Thomas gives her to understand repeatedly and unsubtly that while her form is flawless Nina lacks the inner fire and wildness and all-around bitchiness to dance Odile. One of Thomas many refined cruelties is an ability to fan rivalries among his female dancers and Nina soon becomes fixated on surpassing both Beth (Winona Ryder) a veteran female ballerina on the verge of retirement and Lilly (Mila Kunis) a sultry hard-partying younger member of the corps who seems to possess all the Odilian qualities that Nina lacks. The childlike and seemingly virginal Nina still lives with her overbearing mother (Barbara Hershey) a glittering-eyed loon who gave up her own dance career to have a child and who now spends the day painting creepy portraits in her studio. And thats all you need by way of setup since the drama of casting rehearsing and performing Swan Lake is soon engulfed by the drama taking place in Ninas own mind. Most of Black Swan unfolds in a feverish lurid dream space that we can only assume to be a representation of the heroines subjective experience--though it sometimes does appear as if something objectively nefarious even supernatural may be happening in those cramped rooms and smoky rehearsal studios. By moments Black Swan dabbles effectively in the grisly vocabulary of body horror. In a scene that recalls Cronenbergs The Fly Nina finds the skin of her hand peeling off in long strips. At moments when shes close to finding the black-swan character she develops goosebumps that give her flesh the look of plucked poultry. These scenes have a primal power that even out of context can get your palms sticky with sweat. (Just watch the trailer.) But as the movie goes on this visceral imagery of bodily disintegration never finds a dramatic context to make sense in. Nina is just a collection of neurotic behaviors not a character and nearly all the conflict on screen derives from her victimization (or perceived victimization?) at the hands of others. We never understand whats at stake for her as an artist other than sheer achievement for achievements sake. With this movies curious inattention to the question of why performing matters to its heroine it could just as easily be a movie about a girls brutal struggle to become Baskin Robbins employee of the month. Given the Cronenberg-like flaying I administered to Natalie Portman in my review of last years Brothers I feel its important to specify that Portman is not to blame for whats wrong with Black Swan. She may not be the most nuanced of actresses but this role--a passive frightened girl trying really hard to be perfect--is a lot better suited to Portmans strengths than the earthy working-class mother she played in Brothers. Shes clearly knocked herself out (and scarily dropped 20 pounds from her already sub-size-0 frame) to get the ballet rehearsal scenes to look right. (The actual dancing is done by members of the Pennsylvania Ballet along with Sarah Lane and Kimberly Prosa as Portmans body doubles. ) And in at least one scene the content of which I cant reveal without spoiling the plot Portman does a nice little piece of real (which is to say non-""bravura"") acting. Just as her character drives herself to the edge of madness in pursuit of the black-swan role Portman toils slavishly to realize Aronofskys mad vision. It isnt her fault that despite Black Swans visual splendor and bursts of grand guignol excess this emotionally inert movie never does grow wings. Update Dec. 3 2010 A mention of Portmans body doubles was added to this review after it was originally published. (Return to the updated sentence.) Like Slate on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Dec. 03 2010 1200AM EST Last updated Thursday Mar. 27 2014 1148AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Darren Aronofksy Written by Mark Heyman Andres Heinz John McLaughlin Starring Natalie Portman Vincent Cassel and Mila Kunis Classification 14A Year 2010 Country USA Language English Theres definitely no grey area with Black Swan. Precisely because the film is so brazenly audacious its sometimes risible and yet for the same reason is always compelling impossible not to watch with fascination whether avid or appalled. In this backstage adaptation of Swan Lake Darren Aronofsky has made one of those rare movies that gets right in your face and demands a response Love me hate me just dont mess with Mister In-Between. I confess to camping out at both extremes. On first seeing and disliking it last fall at TIFF I was struck only by the risible stuff by scenes that seemed so literal-minded they cried out for a new title - Requiem for a Metaphor maybe. But after a recent second viewing I came to admire the method in the madness and eerily to realize that my two different reactions to the picture were a perfect reflection of the pictures theme - the psychic tension between opposites the inner battle between our warring selves. I hated the film I loved the film; apparently I was the film.Let me explain. Without wasting a second the first frames blast onto a dance stage right to the prologue of the classic ballet with a riveting close-up of the moment when Von Rothbart casts his deadly spell on the white swan. But wait. Turns out this is a performance-anxiety dream and the dreamer is Nina (Natalie Portman) who a featured dancer in a New York company awakens among the stuffed animals of her virgin-pink bedroom.Soon however the same Nina gets cast in the very part she dreams about obliged to dance both the doomed innocent swan and its evil counterpart. In other words that opening sequence is a dream and its not. In her slumbering mind a spell has indeed been cast on Nina. Already the real is bleeding into the metaphoric until arts staged pretense becomes inseparable from its psychological truth.Everything that follows builds on and compounds that blurred state. For example when Thomas the companys manipulative artistic director (Vincent Cassel) says that his version of Swan Lake will ""strip it down make it visceral and real"" he could be speaking for Aronofsky himself - the ones staged production neatly melds with the others backstage film. Its inevitable then that Nina will encounter her doppelganger her dark twin among the other characters. In fact she finds two black-clad doubles her over-protective mother (Barbara Hershey) who possessively wants to imprison her in a perpetual childhood and the rival dancer Lily (Mila Kunis) who jealously tempts her down the destructive path of drugs and sex.Personally Nina has no wish to explore that path. Artistically though its essential. Her dancing is technically beautiful superbly suited to the white swan but it lacks the seductive abandon required for the noir half of the role. Knowing this Thomas (in another echo of Aronofsky) keeps insisting that she tap into her primal side ""Performance is not just about control. Its about losing yourself."" Translation Nina must destroy the sweet pure girl in order to liberate the bold mature artist. But that idea terrifies her and with good reason - as we know from horror movies metamorphosis can be deadly.So cue the horror movie conventions the multiple mirror images the blood that flows the nightmares that may or may not have any waking credibility. Yet once more these fictional tropes also enjoy a basis in fact. The dancers rehearsal space is actually a hall of mirrors - theyre trained to study their reflection. Ballet is actually a brutal profession - limbs get misshapen feet do bleed. And performance is actually anxiety-inducing - nightmares are commonplace.At this point as were drawn deep inside Ninas fearful psyche its becoming hard to distinguish the actual from the imagined. The bloody scratches on her back are surely real - in a physically punishing business shes given to self-mutilation. But when those scratches morph into inky scales and then black feathers or when she wraps her rival in a lesbian embrace and then gets mean with a shard of glass ... well these are the way-over-the-top sequences where the film doesnt just ""lose itself"" but its audience too. This is the risible stuff.Or is it? The doings in the original Swan Lake are laughable at a literal level but poignant and lovely when viewed metaphorically. Maybe Aronofsky in retelling the story and reshaping the imagery for a different medium deserves the same respect. More profoundly maybe hes upping the thematic ante by adding a further element to the ballets explorations of the tensions between opposites - that is arts own tension between the literal and the symbolic and the consequent wavering of the audience between dismissive laughter and engaged emotion.Either way theres none of the sentimentality that marred Aronofskys work in The Wrestler another tale of public performance and private ennui. Here (save for a cliched turn from Winona Ryder as an aging diva) hes uncompromisingly daring and has found in Portman a brave ally. Shot mainly from the waist up her dance scenes are believable enough but its her broader portrayal that keeps us in thrall. In one sense shes reminiscent of Catherine Deneuve in Repulsion - brittle child-like hallucinating slowly going mad. But in this case the madness is purposeful even deliberate a dark pursuit in the service of art. Yes theres method in it no more so than at the climax when the final set of twinned opposites the creative act and the destructive impulse are wed to the ungodly incantation of these disturbing last words ""It was perfect."" And perhaps it is.Black SwanDirected by Darren AronofskyWritten by Mark Heyman Andres Heinz and John McLaughlinStarring Natalie Portman Vincent Cassel and Mila KunisClassification 14A Report Typo/Error Follow us on Twitter GlobeArts Comments Print /License AA In the know Report on Business In tough job market highly educated feel the squeeze Obituary Robert-Ralph Carmichael created the art on Canadas loonie News How a Dudes Club in Vancouver is helping homeless men feel human again Report on Pokemon Canadians love it a Pokemaster is crowned Werner Herzog is puzzled Life How do I keep peace in the family when money comes up?

Its the kind of nightmare melodrama that rouses the best from director Darren Aronofsky of a piece with his dark spirals Requiem for a Dream and The Wrestler. But its more audacious and complete than either of those films. Long concerned with the desperate lonely places our dreams can lead us Aronofsky has gradually developed the visual vocabulary to match his ambitions.Nina (Natalie Portman) doesnt just want the lead role in her ballet companys unusual production of Swan Lake. You get the feeling she would rather die than lose out. This is ballet as backstage blood sport cutthroat and physically punishing; Ninas tormentors include a sexually manipulative artistic director (Vincent Cassel) a dark new kid on the company block (Mila Kunis) and a smothering stage mom (Barbara Hershey) who wants to keep the kid in her pink frilly bedroom when shes not sweating blood onstage. Striving for pristine perfection - her default mode appropriate for playing the ballets White Swan - Nina is pushed to get in touch with the chaos within necessary to embody the Black Swan.It sounds rather black and white on paper and Black Swans weakest and silliest moments tend to literalize Ninas demise. Fortunately Aronofsky doesnt often operate on a literal plane. He wants to visualize Ninas tenuous mental state and bring flickering form to her descent and he succeeds more often than not. Black Swan cares more about immersive unsteady experience than narrative thrust but its crafty enough to couch that experience in melodramatic story code - the demanding mother the high-pitched confrontations the big event the mania of competition - that audiences can cling to.""This role is destroying you"" Ninas mom exclaims as her daughter falls deeper. She doesnt know quite how right she is. Aronofsky taking a page from Roman Polanskis blood-chilling Repulsion (1965) signals Ninas fall with subtle cues and gradually pulls us over to the other side of the mirror.As in Repulsion sound is crucial. In an early subway trip to the practice studio the standard screeching and scraping noises of the underground take on an otherworldly tone; such cues become less subliminal as the story progresses. Small physical maladies - say a broken toenail - foreshadow nasty distortions of the body. Those scratches on Ninas shoulders become portentous. Black Swan is a masterful portrait of transformation but its not just that. In blurring the line between what Nina sees and feels and what we experience as we watch Aronofsky uses his command of the medium particularly his characters point of view to implicate us in her madness.Portman is more than game for the roles shape-shifting demands. She shows us Nina as a sheltered shrinking violet builds the characters pathos to the breaking point and then sheds the ingenues fear like a snake might shake loose its skin. Kunis brings a slinky sense of bad-girl mischief (and a welcome dab of humor) to Ninas temptress Lilly and Winona Ryder as the fading expendable dancer who haunts Ninas path to success adds a touch of All About Eve.Of course theres one more line for Black Swan to straddle that between the screenplay written by Mark Heyman Andres Heinz and John McLaughlin and the original ballet written by Tchaikovsky. As the two tales dovetail down the stretch and we come to fully inhabit Ninas hysteria Black Swan reaches a fever pitch of frenzy and sends us hurtling toward the finish. The final act mixes euphoria and devastation a combination that leaves you dizzy and appreciative of films power to shake up the senses.Follow movie critic Chris Vognar on Twitter chrisvognar.Directed by Darren AronofskyStarring Natalie Portman Mila Kunis Barbara Hershey Vincent Cassel and Wynona RyderRun time 107 minutesMPAA rating R (sexual content drugs language violence blood) editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

""Yes youre beautiful fearful fragile--ideal casting. But the Black Swan? Its a hard fucking job to dance both."" The scene which takes place early in Darren Aronofskys psychosexual thriller Black Swan is a kind of meta-scene a challenge issued not only to the ballerina but to Portman herself a pointed appraisal of the actresss work to date. MORE ON BLACK SWAN Kevin Fallon 13 Movies to See Before the OscarsThe Atlantic Editors On Our Radar This Week Michael Jackson Home Alone Tim McGraw Black Swan ...Alyssa Rosenberg Natalie Portmans New Trailer I Kissed a Girl Cause Im Crazy Over the years Portmans onscreen persona has been that of Good Girl incarnate sweet but brittle blessed with beauty but not its accompanying self-assurance. Her attempts to play against type have been awkward ones an anemic Ann Boleyn in The Other Boleyn Girl the worlds least world-weary stripper in Closer. Her turn as Princess Padme in George Lucass latter Star Wars trilogy meanwhile very nearly left her career entombed in porcelain. Portmans role as Nina the ballerina in Black Swan is her most mature to date though not precisely her most grownup. (That would likely be her impressively modulated performance as a quasi-widow in last years Brothers.) Like Portman herself Nina is a portrait in extended adolescence teetering between girl-dom and womanhood full of promise not yet quite fulfilled. She lives with her mother (Barbara Hershey a portrait in maternal monstrosity) a bitter ex-ballerina who gave up her career to raise Nina alone. (Dad it is suggested was a backstage seducer.) Ninas existence seems to consist entirely of training auditioning rehearsing stressing herself to the brink of insanity and abusing her body in ways both conventional (bulimia) and esoteric (the mysterious scrapes and scratches on her body appear to be self-inflicted). As he did in his previous film The Wrestler Aronofsky dwells on the physical demands of his protagonists chosen metier then it was steroids and stitches and (in one memorable instance) staplers; now it is sundered toenails and dislocated diaphragms and ballet shoes etched deep with a knife blade for traction. (These are in addition to a variety of bodily transformations--webbed feet? an incipient wing feather?--that may or may not exist only in Ninas mind.) In surveying such mortifications of the flesh Aronofsky captures not only the agony but the devotion in his hands The Passion of the Christ might have amounted to more than a sanctified snuff film. But whereas The Wrestlers Randy ""the Ram"" Robinson (played with collapsed-star gravity by Mickey Rourke) at least found offstage camaraderie with his onstage nemeses Ninas world is one of lithe lovely backstabbers. The film elides the details of Swan Lakes plot focusing on the duality of Odette (the perfect elegant ""White Swan"") and Odile (the carnal passionate ""Black Swan"") and the need for the consummately Odette-y Nina to discover her inner Odile in order to dance both parts. The theme of doubling is omnipresent between Nina and her mother; between Nina and the companys ""aging"" thirtysomething star (Winona Ryder) who is being ushered ungenerously off the stage; and most of all between Nina and Lily ""from San Francisco"" (Mila Kunis) her Black-Swan mirror image erotic and uncontrollable. Is Lily in whose face Nina often sees her own real or merely projection? Aronofsky working from a script by Mark Heyman Andres Heinz and John McLaughlin takes his time before offering answers and those he bestows are seldom clear.Black Swan is vivid and engrossing teetering between trash and art a sleek exploitation borrowing from (among others) Fight Club and The Fly Mulholland Drive and Persona. When finally we witness Portmans transformation from tentative neurotic Nina into the captivating Black Swan the metamorphosis is well worth the wait. (Though it should perhaps be noted it is a role she dances rather than lives and even that only briefly. Whether Portman can sustain such dark charisma remains to be seen.) Yet for all the films unsettling pleasures which linger evocatively its conclusion is a disappointment at once too neat and not neat enough. It offers neither the inevitable culmination of its preceding elements--many of which in retrospect seem to have been thrown in largely for effect--nor the grand grotesquerie toward which the film had appeared to be building. In the end for all its imagination and artistry Aronofskys film achieves neither the pristine elegance of the white swan nor the hallucinatory depravity of the black. It fades instead to gray.

Twitter previousTrack of the Day Seven Nation ArmynextSeeding Future Compromises Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Gary Cameron / Reuters Trump Time Capsule 62 A Man Who Can Be Baited With a Tweet James Fallows None Last night in her overall very successful acceptance speech Hillary Clinton said with ruthless precision about her opponent Ask yourself Does Donald Trump have the temperament to be Commander-in-Chief? Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side.

Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz.

Khizr Khan began his speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday with words I wish he didnt have to say ""Tonight we are honored to stand here as parents of Captain Humayun Khan and as patriotic American Muslims--as patriotic American Muslims with undivided loyalty to our country."" I wish he and his wife didnt have to stand there as the parents of a 27-year-old Army captain who was killed by suicide bombers while serving in the Iraq War. And I wish Khizr Khan hadnt felt the need to declare his patriotism and loyalty to the United States of America. Those truths should have been self-evident. The state of the union is not strong when an American feels compelled to clarify such things. In better times Khizr Khan who was born in Pakistan and moved to America from the United Arab Emirates might have begun his speech with what he said next ""Like many immigrants we came to this country empty-handed. We believed in American democracy--that with hard work and [the] goodness of this country we could share in and contribute to its blessings.""

James Fallows None Mark Salter former chief of staff to Sen. John McCain has written an essay for Real Clear Politics on why he cannot vote for Donald Trump. It deserves note for the long-term record because this is not how associates of a partys former nominee usually talk about the current one and because of its insistence on the importance of tax returns. Salter concludes (emphasis added) Could it be that a major party nominee for president is beholden to Russias leader and might compromise the security interests of the U.S. and our allies to maintain that relationship?  We dont know the answer.... We cant begin to answer the question until Trump releases his tax returns for the last several years. The media should make this the focus of every interview with Trump and senior Trump staff. The Republican Party chairman should urge him to release his returns. The Republican leadership in Congress should insist on it. Every American voter should demand it. There are legitimate suspicions about whether Trumps business relationships could compromise his loyalty to our country. Unless and until he puts them to rest not by dismissing them but by disproving them he should be considered unfit to hold the office of president.

Hillary Clinton is out of the frying pan and into the fire. On July 6 Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that the Justice Department would not pursue criminal charges against the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee for her use of a private email server at the State Department. But the following day with that criminal investigation closed the State Department reopened its own probe into the emails the AP reported. State Department spokesman John Kirby told the AP that it would be looking at potential mishandling of classified information by Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Former officials could face administrative sanctions including a loss of their security clearances--a step that would be both politically embarrassing for Clinton and complicate efforts to staff a national-security team should she prevail in November.

By Peter Rainer Film critic December 3 2010 Save for later Saved Natalie Portman is shown in a scene from Black Swan. Niko Tavernise/Fox Searchlight/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of ""Black Swan"" is a love-it-or-hate-it movie. Put me in the (sort of) hate-it column. My slight qualification here is because Darren Aronofskys movie starring Natalie Portman as an increasingly unhinged ballerina gets points for being unlike anything else thats out there.But being different isnt the same thing as being good. Watching this willfully deranged quasi-horrorfest I would gratefully have chucked it all for a revival of ""The Red Shoes"" which was also pretty flagrant though less deranged.The Powell-Pressburger ""Red Shoes"" (1948) inspired an entire generation of girls to become ballerinas. ""Black Swan"" is likely to have the opposite effect. Scrape off the films heebie-jeebie folderol and youre left with this Become a dancer go mad. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Portmans Nina a virginal young thing with a benevolent-despot stage mom (Barbara Hershey) and a mania for perfection lands the role of the Swan Queen in an upcoming daringly ""revisionist"" (i.e. sexy) production of ""Swan Lake."" The problem is Nina must also dance the ballets bewitching Black Swan. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? In Pictures Natalie Portmans roles Because the stud-Svengali artistic director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) is skeptical that Nina can make it over to the dark side he brings in a rival dancer the sexed-up Lily (Mila Kunis) to act as both goad and back-up. (She also becomes Ninas fantasy lover or maybe its just another one of those now-you-see-it-now-you-dont dream sequences.)Working from a script by Mark Hey-man Andres Heinz and John McLaughlin Aronofsky plays up the thematic parallels between Ninas dissolution and the narrative of ""Swan Lake."" He dresses Nina in white and her co-players in dark colors just in case we missed the point.He blurs the line from the get-go between her reality and her rapidly accelerating fearful fantasies. A split toenail in this movie is never just a split toenail. Its a portal into horror or to be more specific artsy B-movie horror shenanigans.The technique of visually connecting a crazy persons interior and exterior worlds has been in the movies since at least ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" (1920). But Nina has so little psychological substance in ""Black Swan"" and Portmans performance is so glaceed that watching her come apart seems like an exercise in voyeurism. Or sadism. It doesnt even matter on some level if Nina is a dancer. Her obsession with ballet has very little to do with artistic expression - its obsession for the sake of obsession (an Aronofsky specialty - see ""The Wrestler"" and ""Pi"").Aronofsky doesnt exactly demonstrate a reverence for the art himself. He uses the ballet world with its notoriously grueling physical and psychological regimens as an excuse for a Grand Guignol meltdown. (The ballets score in the film by the way is not 100 percent Tchaikovsky which means this is the second time in a month that Pyotr Ilyich has gotten the bums rush in the movies - the other being the execrable new ""Nutcracker 3-D"" which doesnt even feature dancing.)It was around the time Nina sprouted feathers that I decided ""Black Swan"" was either a vast put-on (too obvious) or vastly pretentious (more likely). Many moviegoers especially high-toned ones will believe otherwise. For them anything this feverishly absurd and obviously made by smart people must be a work of art.You can pick out all the references in this movie to other movies not only ""Red Shoes"" and ""Caligari"" but also for starters ""Phantom of the Opera"" ""All About Eve"" ""Repulsion"" and Aronofskys own dreamy-druggy freak show ""Requiem for a Dream."" In the end however ""Black Swan"" has the distinction of being its own beast. Its a dubious distinction.

Starring Natalie Portman Mila Kunis Winona Ryder Sebastian Stan Vincent Cassel Janet Montgomery Barbara Hershey Christopher Gartin Toby Hemingway Kristina Anapau Director Darren Aronofsky Release Opened Dec 3 2010  Editorial Review A destructive dance of horror and beautyBy Ann HornadayFriday December 3 2010Since making ""Pi"" his audaciously low-tech black-and-white debut feature in 1998 director Darren Aronofsky has proven one of the most protean forces in Hollywood delivering a steady stream of visionary experiments (""Requiem for a Dream"" ""The Fountain"") and intimate dramas (""The Wrestler""). Aronofsky brings both those sensibilities to bear on ""Black Swan"" a near-masterpiece of a film set in the hothouse world of New York ballet. With this hallucinatory trip down a rabbit hole that is equally seductive and repellent he makes a bid for a canon that includes no less than Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger (""The Red Shoes"") and Herbert Ross (""The Turning Point"") in creating a ballet film that captures both the gossamer pink softness of classical dance and the scarier psychological impulses lying just beneath the serene surface. Like its predecessors ""Black Swan"" begins as a backstage drama but winds up being a meditation on female ambition which in this case gets punished with singularly perverse excess. Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) has obsessively perfected her flawless technique at an unnamed New York company for years when shes finally considered for the lead in an upcoming production of ""Swan Lake."" As her manipulative artistic director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) observes Nina possesses all the innocence and self-control of the Swan Queen but his ""stripped-down visceral"" version of the ballet demands that she also portray the Black Queen. Shes a sinuous primal persona he doesnt think Nina can pull off. Its difficult to disagree With her breathy whisper of a voice cosseted home life with overprotective mother Erica (Barbara Hershey) and wide-eyed sexual naivete Nina remains a child-woman swaddled in feathery scarves and downy pink shrugs. Whats more a tattooed ingenue named Lily (Mila Kunis in a smashing breakout performance) has just joined the company presenting a loose-limbed smoky-eyed threat to Ninas tightly wound rectitude. Aronofsky working from a script by Mark Heyman takes all of the classic tropes of ballet films - the lushness and lyricism the determination and competition - and ruthlessly twists their classical lines contorting them with gothic horror that only grows more brutal as Ninas interior life becomes more unhinged. As he did with ""The Wrestler"" Aronofsky often films Portman from behind with a handheld camera an elaboration on the entire films immersive point of view. (That oblique style is particularly well suited here where Portmans carriage and posture express so much not to mention an impressively sculpted trapezius.) With image and sound - especially those familiar booming strains of Tchaikovsky - ""Black Swan"" wraps filmgoers in a world where some of the toughest athletes on the planet push and pummel themselves into making the most strenuous feats seem effortless. Its also a world of nearly incurable narcissism a theme Aronofsky and production designer Therese DePrez elaborate in the countless mirrors that with the black-and-white color scheme make up the films chief visual motifs. Nina may be entranced by her own reflection but incapable of loving herself; early in ""Black Swan"" Leroy posits that shell never be a truly great dancer until she frees herself sexually. Aronofsky like Nina herself labors too obviously to drive that point home and in a few scenes allows literalism to get in the way of what could have been left tantalizingly ambiguous. These few misfires do little to break the spell cast by ""Black Swan"" which despite its flaws delivers the most sensitive and observant portrayals of female ambivalence in recent memory. Of all the rapturous haunting and outright frightening scenes in ""Black Swan"" by far the most memorable is when Nina calls her mother from a bathroom stall to share a piece of important news. Before that episode and after Portman delivers an uncompromising performance whether shes called on to be fragile or recklessly bold. But that moment on the phone bespeaks complete emotional transparency conveying vulnerability terror and surpassing joy all at once. The episode also makes utterly palpable Ninas tortured relationship to her own incipient power. And that troubled dynamic plays out most mythically through her encounters with three women Lily; an embittered aging ballerina named Beth (Winona Ryder); and especially Erica whose engulfing love and resentment of her daughter form ""Black Swans"" most potent psychological accelerant. Erica a former dancer who gave up her career to have Nina could be the direct descendant of Shirley MacLaines Deedee in ""The Turning Point."" As personified by Hershey in a deliciously menacing performance Erica takes mixed feelings to a new level of menace and enmeshment. In a movie where boundaries have a way of slipping and sliding into one another the cozy cramped apartment where Erica and Nina hash out their Oedipal battles begins to resemble less a haven than a toxic cocoon. Like just about everything in ""Black Swan"" Aronofsky executes this familiar but distorted domestic tableau with precision skill and feeling that would please even Ninas most severe inner critic. Like his heroine Aronofsky teeters on the brink of greatness; unlike her he doesnt hesitate to swing for the rafters to achieve it. Contains strong sexual content disturbing violent images profanity and some drug use.

Portman battles inner demons and Mila Kunis who plays her dance rival -- and make-out partner. ( ) Natalie Portman in ""Black Swan."" (AP) Ive given four stars our highest rating to four other movies this year. The one Id most gladly watch again -- Ive seen it three times -- is Darren Aronofskys ""Black Swan"" a delirious fever-dream of a psychosexual thriller starring Natalie Portman as a ballerina descending into madness in far and away the best performance of the year. VIDEO BLACK SWAN SOARS This eye-popping inspired and often-demented (in a good way) cross between ""The Red Shoes"" and ""All About Eve"" channels horror maestros David Cronenberg Brian De Palma and Dario Argento. Its also something of a companion piece to Aronofskys ""The Wrestler"" (the unsettling ending is very similar) but far surpasses the earlier film. ""Black Swan"" is probably not however for nitpickers unwilling to set aside questions of plausibility and immerse themselves in an experience thats often uncomfortable by design. ON THE SCENE BLACK SWAN PREMIERE BLACK SWAN IS A BEAUTIFUL NIGHTMARE FILM JUST DANCES AROUND THE ART PHOTOS NATALIE PORTMANS MOST MEMORABLE ROLES Much of the action takes place in the fevered imagination of Nina (Portman) a neurasthenic 20-something dancer with a thinly disguised version of the New York City Ballet. She begins going to pieces when much to her surprise and terror she lands the lead in a ""re-imagined"" production of ""Swan Lake."" Its a perfect storm of disaster for the self-mutilating and cripplingly insecure Nina who lives with her infantalizing single mother a failed ballerina (Barbara Hershey) in a claustrophobic Upper West Side apartment full of stuffed animals. Magnifying Ninas neuroses is Thomas (French actor Vincent Cassel) the companys imperious and lecherous dance director who repeatedly expresses doubt about her ability to play the more challenging part of ballets dual role -- The Black Swan who tricks the prince into thinking shes The White Swan. Thomas encourages Nina to explore her sexuality -- preferably with him -- to ""loosen up."" This does not sit well with Beth (Winona Ryder) Thomas aging lover and prima ballerina who hes pushing into retirement. Thomas helpfully suggests to Nina that Beths self-destructive streak makes her work onstage more interesting. The greatest threat to Ninas sanity by far is Lily (Mila Kunis) a sexy hard-partying newcomer to the company whom Thomas installs as Ninas understudy. Nina quickly becomes convinced Lily is angling for her job. In the movies most talked-about scene the two have some steamy girl-on-girl action after Lily gets Nina drunk and drugged the night before a dress rehearsal. Or is it all a fantasy going on inside Ninas increasingly paranoid head? Either way this is one ballet movie that women wont have trouble getting their guys to attend -- even if a lot of it is about womens issues with aging. Cassel Kunis Hershey and Ryder are all terrific in the years best-cast movie. The huge triumph though is Portman a prohibitive favorite for the Best Actress Oscar for her dazzling tour-de-force as the skeletal and tortured Nina. Director Aronofsky triumphs in a high-wire act. He skirts ludicrousness by balancing some truly creepy bloody stuff with some stunningly beautiful ballet sequences enhanced by digital effects. Aronofsky is abetted by Matthew Libatiques cinematography and the choreography by Benjamin Millepied (Portmans real-life boyfriend who also plays the hunky ""Swan Lake"" prince in the movie). ""Black Swan"" which re-purposes (and sometimes remixes) Tchaikovskys immortal music to truly striking effect is my favorite film of the year. Go see it already. (By the way my other four-star movies are ""Inception"" ""The Social Network"" ""127 Hours"" and ""The Kings Speech."") lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Actress Rachel McAdams caught smooching British actor Mich...

Natalie Portman in BLACK SWAN. Photo Niko Tavernise Fox Searchlight Black Swan review Shes dancing on the edge 1 / 4 Back to Gallery Black Swan Drama. Starring Natalie Portman Mila Kunis Vincent Cassel Barbara Hershey and Winona Ryder. Directed by Darren Aronofsky. (R. 103 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Theres something demented about ""Black Swan"" and not in a good way. Its excessive and psychologically imprecise coarse where it should be refined and too much like a David Cronenberg horror movie in places where restraint and intellectual rigor are called for. Yet this story of an up-and-coming ballerina facing a psychological crisis is the movie out there most worth talking about - and so in way its the most worth seeing. For all its ham-fistedness it captures something about the tyranny of the ballet world and by extension the neurotic imprisonment of female body image. The asceticism and beauty of ballet and the subjugation ritual and devotion that a ballerinas life requires have no other modern equivalent. To find anything like it youd have to go back to some medieval cult of hysterical self-flagellating nuns. Both examples involve young women pursuing some rarefied transcendence that in a mythic way speaks to a larger world of female fantasy and experience. Jane Campion with her cold meticulousness and womans insight could have made a masterpiece out of this material. But Darren Aronofsky a more full-bodied but less psychologically astute director is the one who made it. He concentrates on the physical details - the cracked toenails the toes that stick together the dislocated ribs the slippers the pain the blood - in ways that call to mind his previous film ""The Wrestler."" What he doesnt understand he brazens through. Related Stories Black Swan At the center of the tempest is Natalie Portman as a ballerina who has devoted every waking minute of her life to her dream and now its really really close. She is up for the role of the Swan Queen in a new production of ""Swan Lake"" but the ballet master (Vincent Cassel) though certain of her incarnation as the virtuous White Swan half of the dual role doubts that she has the sexual allure and spontaneity to play the White Swans evil twin ... the Black Swan. Nina (Portman) is contrasted with Mila Kunis as Lily who has Black Swan written all over her. Her ease in her body is an unspoken rebuke to Ninas self-punishment - the rigidness and perfection that is limiting Ninas artistry. Kunis wonderfully epitomizes the freedom sexuality and confidence of an undamaged self. But then anyone would be damaged with a mother like Ninas who waits every night for Nina to come through the door and then pounces on her with questions and smothering solicitation. The toxic interaction between Portman and Barbara Hershey as mother and daughter is the most charged and subtle element in the film. Mom is loving and attentive but witchy and scary so narcissistic and conflicted that she cant see the unspeakable truth that she wants her daughter to fail. The films central question is whether Nina can break with Mom decisively enough to find the Black Swan within. We see the strain in the frightened compression of Portmans face as her artistic and emotional lives converge. The familiar showbiz trope - will she hold it together for opening night? - has been rarely if ever conveyed in such extreme terms. She will either end up the toast of the town or in a straitjacket. The line between realized artistry and mental disorder can be blurry and this is where the filmmakers particularly Aronofsky lose control and come near turning ""Black Swan"" into a full-blown psycho movie. Every object becomes a potential weapon. Blood is everywhere. Yet the more flamboyant the movie gets the less dramatic and the movies lack of clarity in its fundamental psychological terms becomes a letdown. Yes shes cracking up but how shes cracking up becomes muddled. Still this is a movie of serious ambition and to recognize the distance between its achievement and its aspiration is not to deny its quality. If Portmans performance falls short of greatness its the fault of the movie for being more about style than revelation. Still her emotional repression and physical intensity are impressive and she goes deep into every area Aronofsky offers her doing absolutely everything she can do with whats there. Oscars have been won for less. -- Advisory Blood sexual situations simulated sex.

"Black Swan Black and blue and ready to spread her wings | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesBlack Swan Black and blue and ready to spread her wingsNatalie Portman delivers such a jaw-dropping performance in Black Swan theres initial temptation to agree with characters in the film who wrongly doubt her transformative ability.Natalie Portman dances into Oscar territory with her performance in Black Swan.  (HANDOUT)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Dec. 2 2010 Black Swan (out of 4) Starring Natalie Portman Vincent Cassel Mila Kunis Barbara Hershey and Winona Ryder. Directed by Darren Aronofsky. At major theatres. 103 minutes. 14A Black Swan is ballet as gladiator contest where the most vicious antagonists are the warring halves of a dancers mind. Her descent into near madness in Darren Aronofskys bold film seems so real you actually fear for the sanity of Natalie Portman whose portrayal is the years best female performance at the movies. This is Portmans bid for Best Actress at the next Oscars and it thrills to watch her go for it. Shes so convincingly fragile as crystalline ballerina Nina who must summon untapped dark impulses that viewers may initially be tempted to agree with characters in the film who doubt her transformative ability. Nina is virginal in mind if not body. She wraps herself in pink sleeps with stuffed animals and meekly heeds her mommy dearest (Barbara Hershey). Fearful of the world Ninas face resembles the haunted visages of a Roman Polanski or Michael Haneke film. She rarely speaks up except when stating her self-loathing obsession ""I just want to be perfect."" Is there any wonder her mother her artistic director Thomas (Vincent Cassel) and rival dancers all question her aptitude for the tricky dual role of Odette/Odile in Tchaikovskys Swan Lake the new seasons choice for her New York ballet company? The role which Nina desperately wants requires the principal dancer to leap from white swan Odette to black swan Odile in the magical wooing of beloved Prince Siegfried. Thomas knows Nina has the talent and grace of sweet Odette. But can she summon the ""visceral and real"" (read sexual) emotions to convincingly play evil Odile? If you recall Portmans performance from Closer where she seduces Clive Owen in a strip club (wearing a pink wig yet) you need no further proof that she can channel base impulses. She provides it anyway but not before Nina has been pushed to the brink of insanity. Afflicted with scratching and eating disorders harangued by her mother and taunted by Thomas and fellow dancers Lily (Mila Kunis) and Beth (Winona Ryder) Nina begins having violent hallucinations. Could these nightmares be real? The classical waltz music on Clint Mansells soundtrack inspired by Tchaikovskys original frequently turns strident in the manner of horror movies as do the visuals. As he did in the equally potent The Wrestler Aronofsky takes a single intense performance and frames it within an unyielding study of an obsessive pursuit. Aronofsky and cinematographer Matthew Libatique view ballet as one would the bloody ancient rites of Romes Colosseum. Their camera seizes upon bruised feet battered bodies and wounded expressions. But they also show flashes of the release that dancing provides moments when pain gravity and doubt no longer apply. The gladiator rites of ballet fascinate Aronofsky and also screenwriters Mark Heyman Andres Heinz and John McLaughlin. Ambitious ballerinas must learn to dance upon the broken and discarded bodies of those who came before them. The latter includes Ryders Beth a prima ballerina on the downslide whom Thomas replaces with Nina. Beth is mocked as a has-been hoofer ready for the glue factory as she approaches 40 both onscreen and in real life. How cruel is the sting of stage and screen But Beth will not go quietly. Someone else wants to trample upon Nina. Kunis hot and hateful Lily alternately befriends and betrays the fledgling star as she seeks to take the Odette/Odile roles for herself. Then there are the tangled motivations of Ninas mother a bitter failed ballerina. She never reached the summit her daughter now approaches. Will mom extend a helping hand to her daughter or push her over the edge? If theres a flaw in Black Swan its the absolute focus on Portman. It prevents us from plumbing the depths of the other characters a failing that most affects Cassels Thomas. Hes entertaining as the roue that Cassel can play so well but hes not sinister enough to be a true antagonist to Nina. But then few actors could hope to stand next to Portman in this movie and come out the better for it. Her performance is the reason why you must see Black Swan. Shes on fire consuming everything around her.

(Niko Tavernise) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday December 2 2010 118 PM Title Black Swan A dancer falls apart. With Natalie Portman Mila Kunis. Director Darren Aronofsky (147). R Sexuality language violence drugs. At area theaters.In 2008s ""The Wrestler"" Darren Aronofsky located the sensitive grace hiding within a bloody maligned sport. And now in ""Black Swan"" he exposes the destructive obsession that sparks breathtaking beauty.Just as his last film relied on Mickey Rourkes Oscar-nominated performance this one demands a commitment previously unseen from star Natalie Portman. But while the former was most effective in its gritty realism""Swan"" is a psychosexual thriller that lures its viewers into a woozy nightmare.As a member of a prestigious New York ballet company Portmans Nina knows little outside her tiny world. If it doesnt happen at Lincoln Center or in the apartment she shares with her mother (Barbara Hershey) it may as well not exist.Nina is ecstatic when artistic director Thomas (Vincent Cassel) taps her for the lead in his new production of ""Swan Lake."" But she isnt prepared for the intense demands of the role which requires her to play both the innocent white swan so familiar to her own personality and the angry sensual black swan she continues to repress.A high-strung perfectionist Nina is so neurotically fragile that she becomes increasingly incapable of discerning friends from foes or even fantasy from reality. Her manipulative mother wants her to relive the past a new rival (Mila Kunis) threatens her present and a retiring dancer (Winona Ryder) hints at her future. Together they represent a Grimm sort of fairy tale that Nina simultaneously desires and dreads.Aronofsky and his three screenwriters walk a thin line throughout skirting overwrought melodrama without actually falling in.Thats a near-impossible task requiring considerable skill from everyone involved. Portman who does most of her own dancing rises to the occasion with unexpected depth while a nuanced turn from Kunis offsets exaggerated performances by Hershey and Ryder.Its Aronofsky though who deserves the final bow. He has always boasted a unique vision but as any dancer can attest it takes years of hard work and discipline to corral talent into art. ""Black Swan"" neither aims for nor achieves the heartbreaking humanity of ""The Wrestler"" but its Freudian anxieties are bound to haunt your dreams.eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"Movie review Black Swan - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review Black SwanDarren Aronofskys ballet film starring Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis is an overheated slog.December 03 2010|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic You wont be having a lot of fun at ""Black Swan"" but the less seriously you take this wildly melodramatic unashamedly pulpy look at the blood sport that is New York City ballet the better your chances are of enjoying yourself even a little. This tale of feathered ambition starring Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis as dueling ballerinas is not just any kind of trash its high-art trash a kind of ""When Tutu Goes Psycho"" that so prizes hysteria over sanity that its worth your life to tell when its characters are hallucinating and when theyre not. In fact the only problem with calling ""Black Swan"" sensationalistic and over the top is that it makes this shameless shotgun marriage of ""The Red Shoes"" and Roger Corman sound like more fun than it is. The director here is the earnest Darren Aronofsky and his trademark sledgehammer style makes any kind of enjoyment difficult. As he showed in ""The Wrestler"" and earlier this is someone who believes in bludgeoning audiences into submission. When you experience ballet the Aronofsky way you count yourself lucky that the dancers dont have easy access to staple guns. Not that ballerina Nina Sayers (Portman) would know what to do with a staple gun even if she had one. As presented in the screenplay by Mark Heyman Andrew Heinz and John McLaughlin Nina is supposed to be a Goody Two Shoes a virginal drone whos devoted her life to dance and labored for years in the corps de ballet without a peep of protest. Nina is such a timid soul she doesnt seem to mind living with her hovering possessive over-solicitous mother Erica ( Barbara Hershey) a former ballerina herself who worries that her deserving daughters chances for stardom are dribbling away. Not to worry Mom. Thomas Leroy (French star Vincent Cassel) the ballets imperious artistic director (is there any other kind?) has his mind on change. With a big production of ""Swan Lake"" coming up he deep-sixes aging prima ballerina Beth Macintyre ( Winona Ryder at her most psychotic) and tells Nina she just might be in line for the starring role and the chance to play the ballets white and black swans. But wait theres a catch. Actually two catches the first being a flesh-and-blood rival named Lily (Kunis) a hot new dancer who shows up at rehearsal literally ""straight off the plane"" from where else but California. Not for nothing does Lily hail from San Francisco and not Sheboygan. Geography is destiny here and we are meant to understand that Lily is a sensual free spirit someone who gleefully breaks any rule she can get her hands on. She even has a tattoo No sooner does Lily arrive than Nina starts to feel this newcomer is trying to upstage her. It doesnt help matters that while Thomas has no problem envisioning Nina as the angelic white swan he is not at all sure if she can connect with the white swans lustful evil twin the black swan of the films title. A controlling manipulative Svengali not unlike ""The Red Shoes"" Boris Lermontov Thomas is more than eager to help Nina connect to her dark side. He calls her frigid dares her not to be a coward and all but screams ""perfection is not just about control; its also about letting go."" Letting go as card-carrying Californian Lily surely knows can be movie code for sex and soon enough Nina whose bedroom looks like it hasnt changed since she was a toddler is encouraged to become involved in the kind of soft-core antics that will remind those with long memories of Radley Metzgers mostly forgotten ""Therese and Isabelle"" and ""Camille 2000."" The idea behind ""Black Swan"" in as much as it has an idea beyond the presentation of sensation is that the quest for perfection can unhinge the unwary. Its a plausible notion but the problem is that Aronofsky in his deterministic zeal cant help but stack that deck. What that means is that Nina is a walking nervous breakdown from the moment we see her. With her unexplained scratch marks and penchant for seeing strange people on the subway theres not a moment in the film in which she feels like anything other than a wreck. This lack of subtlety in Ninas predicament means that all the grueling physical work the actresses put in to make the dancing convincing notwithstanding there is nowhere of sustained interest for their characters to go. But expecting subtlety from a Darren Aronofsky film is like expecting Pixar to announce a slasher movie.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + A dancers body has been described as an instrument of beauty sculpture in motion heavens architecture. Martha Graham said dance is the bodys song. In the popular imagination a ballerina is the picture of grace beauty elegance and alignment. So leave it to the director of ""Requiem for a Dream and ""The Wrestler to turn that body into a temple of doom -- complete with inky feathers a bulls grunt and webbed feet. To be fair the mind in question is no pleasure garden either.Natalie Portman speeds around ""Black Swan in a state of corseted frenzy. She plays Nina a demure but eager prima ballerina in a New York ballet company and while the director Darren Aronofsky furnishes many scenes of Nina doing turns and grueling pointe work what I remember most about movement in this commercially daring freak-out is all the running she does -- through corridors and across Lincoln Center with the camera at her back. Its no running that Usain Bolt or Tom Cruise would recognize. Its a gait of intense composure -- the ballet version of a 40-yard dash.Where Nina is so desperately rushing is a perfectionists masochistic paradise. But on the way she tries to save her starring role in ""Swan Lake from Lily (Mila Kunis) the companys sexy back-tattooed new dancer. Its that sort of movie. Some girls fight over men. Ballerinas fight over parts. But the occasional brilliance of ""Black Swan is that its a one-way fight. Nina battles herself.In the opening minutes Nina says shes awoken from a dream in which shes landed the Swan Queen role in a new production of ""Swan Lake. She spends the rest of the film chasing the part and defending it. Before auditions the companys hilariously sleazy artistic director Thomas (Vincent Cassel) explains the show to his dancers. A virgin is turned into a white swan. The love of a prince could break the spell. But a black swan seduces him away. The white swan leaps to her death. Curtains.Thomas wants do it ""stripped-down ""visceral and ""real. As is customary hell have the same dancer play both swans. The movies innovation is to gradually assume the magic-realist moroseness of the ballet. Aronofskys rendition is just grislier and has more impalings.Nina wins the part. But even then Thomas in his insinuating French accent continues to beg her to tap into the Swan Queens dark side. It wont be easy. Nina wears pink boucle. She practices nonstop. She lives with her single mother Erica (Barbara Hershey) the sort of faded ballerina who had to give it all up to have Nina. Anyone whos seen ""Carrie ""The Piano Teacher ""Precious or Disneys current hit ""Tangled will know the mother-daughter relationship in ""Black Swan is comparably loaded. When Erica evilly threatens to throw out a celebratory cake Nina steels herself for a dreaded lick of icing. At some point Nina tries to masturbate and in walks mom. Nina becomes so consumed with becoming this monster seductress that her body simply begins to turn her into one. Her skin is pimpling like a chickens. Her shoulder blades are scarred. Is her body repaying her for those bulimic bathroom breaks? Aronofsky situates the entire film so deeply inside Ninas fraying psyche that were unsure whether to believe the figurative monsters Nina concocts. Is Erica a gorgon because thats how Nina sees her? Is the companys fading star (Winona Ryder) also its Norma Desmond? (Ryder now seems imprisoned in hag roles. Please free Winona.) Is the more socially limber Lily a frenemy or just the girl with a dragon tattoo?Written by Mark Heyman Andres Heinz and John McLaughlin the film works as a psychological horror-thriller about artistic obsession. Ninas paranoia and narcissism overtake her. After a night of partying is she making love to Lily or herself? Is she dreaming or displacing? The suspense is in waiting for an alarm to go off. It never does. That ambiguity makes what Kunis does here surprising. I dont buy her as a ballerina. Im not sure I buy her as an actress either. But shes a pungent comedian. Her sorority-girl cadence and slouchy physicality are real in a work of nasty surrealism.The sex here (self- same- and otherwise) is fascinatingly complex for an American movie. So are Matthew Libatiques gymnastic camerawork and Therese DePrezs art direction which uses cramped space reflected surfaces and wall-hangings to amplify Ninas states of mind.Aronofsky is adept at personifying what the body can take and what it cant. Each of his films are about a kind of mystical ambition -- the drive to solve an elusive number (""Pi) to get high (""Requiem for a Dream) to live forever (""The Fountain) to win an Oscar for Mickey Rourke (""The Wrestler). As with those movies ""Black Swan is perched on the edge of madness. If theres a problem its that it doesnt fully succumb. Even during the trashy illogical backstage climax it has only one foot in the loony bin.Still that restraint might have actually revealed a new range in Portman. Her vestal qualities are under siege (once again) but shes so discreetly expressive that DePrezs illuminating decor is a bonus. Good material and a smart filmmaker have freed Portman to take chances with discretion. Her biggest risk is not going for too much. Often shes just the back of a head or undulating arms or a visage in a mirror. But theres inner turmoil in this performance and Portman doesnt need to jackhammer into it for us to feel its there.Youre always afraid that the actors in an Aronofsky movie are going to fall over dead. I at least cant believe Ellen Burstyn made it out of ""Requiem for a Dream alive. But Portman and Aronofsky are in sync. He works hard so despite the year Portman spent in intensive training she doesnt appear to have to.This isnt terribly deep -- most of the thrill is gone by a second viewing -- and you can often feel Aronofskys exertion. But the movie looms in the memory. Its superbly calibrated for one thing. Aronofsky uses cinema to fully inhabit a characters kaleidoscopic ruptures. We dont know in ""Black Swan how far inside Ninas head we are until its too late. On her deathbed the legendary ballerina Anna Pavlova is said to have instructed the man upstairs to ""Get my swan costume ready. Nina seems poised to snatch it back.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. Follow him at www.twitter.com/wesley_morris. (c) Copyright 2010 Globe Newspaper Company.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> If visions of sugarplums dance in your head stay the hell away from Black Swan a hotblooded head-spinning erotic thriller in which director Darren Aronofsky does to ballet what Kanye West does to rap turns it into his own beautiful dark twisted fantasy. Just as he did with the fight game in The Wrestler Aronofsky treats ballet as one of the bleeding arts. And so does his breathtaking star Natalie Portman who delivers an all-stops-out performance that will soon be the stuff of legend. Portman plays Nina a dancer who knows she cant make it in the competitive world of New York City ballet unless she damn near kills herself trying. Whats not broken on her body is black and blue. Her mother Erica (an indelible Barbara Hershey) once a ballerina herself cracks the whip at home. The goal is the lead role in Swan Lake available after the forced eviction of aging prima ballerina Beth (Winona Ryder neurotically on point). Thomas (a mesmerizing Vincent Cassel) the companys director is enthralled by Ninas innocence as Odette the White Swan but feels she lacks the seductive heat required as Odettes alter ego the Black Swan. ""Go home and touch yourself"" he advises his repressed protegee as his eye wanders to rival dancer Lily played with sly wit and smoldering fire by Mila Kunis.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> In lesser hands the plot could be campy soapsuds. OK sometimes it is. But Aronofsky taking off from a script by Mark Heyman Andres Heinz and John J. McLaughlin is a fearless visionary. The Brooklyn-born director of Pi Requiem for a Dream and The Fountain pushes his limits -- and ours. Ninas obsessions have her tearing at her flesh raging at her mother and ripping into frenzied girl-on-girl action with Lily. Then the movie tips over into horror blurring the line between reality and hallucination. Black Swan is a high-wire act for Aronofsky and Portman as they lure us into Ninas tormented mind. The swirling hand-held camerawork of Matthew Libatique coupled with a Clint Mansell score that channels Tchaikovskys ecstatic dread adds to the whirlwind. At the center of it all is Portman. The actress 29 trained in ballet as a child and drilled hard for nearly a year to master the choreography and do most of her own dancing. Portmans portrait of an artist under siege is unmissable and unforgettable. So is the movie. You wont know what hit you.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The sheltered ballerina Natalie Portman plays in Darren Aronofskys Black Swan dreams of dancing the part of Odette in Swan Lake. But even in her dreams shes shadowed. She never imagines herself dancing with Prince Siegfried the hero; her pas de deux are with Von Rothbart the villain of the piece the sorcerer who ultimately seals Odettes doom. His spell transforms her into the swan He gives her death and beauty wrapped together and as the fevered film progresses and Portman gets drawn further away from the childhood bedroom over which her mother (Barbara Hershey) keeps such careful watch she starts to see the same pattern play out in life. Its hard knowledge to process however and harder still to incorporate it into performance. A seasoned dancer usually consigned to supporting roles Portman gets a chance to audition for Odette thanks to the unexpected not entirely voluntary departure of her companys prima ballerina. Her director (Vincent Cassel) has concerns about her ability to dance Odettes dark counterpart the Black Swan. She has the technique but Cassel keeps suggesting she lacks the shadows around her soul or the sexual magnetism for the part even as he slips his tongue into her mouth. Meanwhile Mila Kunis a new addition to the company starts lingering in the margins and showing up wherever Portman happens to be like something from a dream. She dances the Black Swan effortlessly. Aronofsky and cinematographer Matthew Libatique give Black Swan the look of a degraded nightmare and the intensity of a shared hallucination. Dealing in the same grand gestures and overstated themes as its balletic inspiration--while adding touches of The Red Shoes and Repulsion plus its own atmosphere of unshakable dread--Black Swan is a florid often lurid completely enthralling film held in place by a disarming Portman who rarely leaves the frame. A psychological thriller about the creative process Black Swan lingers on the pain and repetition that allowed Portmans character to reach ballets rarefied heights and explores the effects of that dedication. (It isnt just a film about ballet either As an actress Portman has never seemed particularly convincing in Black Swan roles. And the casting of the outgoing ballet star and the way dance chews women up and spits them out consciously echoes Hollywood.) For the sake of art shes given up on life. When she embraces it her art flourishes but threatens to consume her. In the end is the price of beauty worth it? The film provides an ecstatic ""yes"" trailed by haunting echoes.

Comments (5) click to enlarge Black Swan Recommended Rated R  103 minutes  2010 After the critical and commercial success of The Wrestler writer-director Darren Aronofsky pivots from the wrestling ring to the ballet studio and from a battered Mickey Rourke to the delicate Natalie Portman. She plays a New York City ballerina whose demanding and lecherous director (Vincent Cassel) awards her a starring dual role--as the virginal ""White Swan"" and the sensual ""Black Swan""--in his new interpretation of Swan Lake. Buffeted by her jealous mother (Barbara Hershey) her backstabbing understudy (Mila Kunis) and a frigid perfectionism that badly inhibits her performance as the Black Swan the dancer begins to melt down as only an Aronofsky character can. The black/white duality isnt terribly interesting but as in most of Aronofskys films an intense horror of the body and its uncontrollability fuels the rhapsodic psychodrama (2010). By J.R.

"Black Swan An odd yet interesting bird - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Black Swan An odd yet interesting birdBlack Swan a 3 1/2 starsDecember 02 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticMainlining Tchaikovskys ""Swan Lake"" ballet score like a drug addict ""Black Swan"" pushes its protagonist a Manhattan ballerina devoted (and then some) to her craft to the brink of insanity and then a couple of subway stops beyond. Director Darren Aronofskys film is with her all the way. Its intensity risks absurdity in nearly every scene even the ones not featuring Winona Ryder as the alcoholic castoff of the sneering ballet impresario played by Vincent Cassel. Is ""Black Swan"" high-minded? Im happy to say No. It is extremely high-grade hokum which is to say it offers several different and combustible varieties. Doubtless some audiences will resist it or wonder how seriously to take the fantasy/reality games the screenplay plays with its central figure. Weve seen a lot of what happens here before in its depiction of artistic torment (""The Red Shoes"" ""All About Eve"" ""Showgirls"") as well as its visual strategy. Aronofskys previous film ""The Wrestler"" relates to ""Black Swan"" in its over-the-shoulder hand-held chronicling of its central embattled warrior. Yet the movie feels all of a piece. Aronofsky soaks the material in the ballet score and uses Tchaikovskys themes as well as composer Clint Mansells variations to heighten each paranoid turn of the narrative. Guiding it all Natalie Portmans performance as the dying swan is formidable in its nerve-racking expressivity. It is in fact a racked nerve personified. The original script located the backstage nastiness in a Broadway production fraught with tension between a star and her eager understudy. Rewrites guided by Aronofsky relocated the action to a New York City ballet company where Nina (Portman) aches for the showcase double role of the virginal Swan Queen and her witchy opposite the Black Swan. Her chief rival is the brazenly sensual new kid in town Lily who struts into rehearsals like the female lead in a musical based on ""Mulholland Drive."" Shes played by Mila Kunis who keeps the characterization this side of caricature. Ninas slithering frenemy represents everything Nina has yet to explore. Exploration of any kind is tough for our poor heroine Her cloistered life is confined largely to an apartment littered with stuffed rabbits and ""Swan Lake"" memorabilia under the thumb of her former ballerina mother ( Barbara Hershey). ""Its all this pressure isnt it?"" she queries desperately inspecting mysterious scratch marks on Ninas back. The way she asks the question you can sense the pressure increasing. Everything good about ""Black Swan"" announces itself in the prologue. Were in Ninas dream. She is dancing the role destined to take over her life with the male dancer (in the role of spell-casting Von Rothbart) digitally transforming into a birdlike monster drawing her into the shadows. Its presented as if a single take. The music dominates but Aronofsky does his best to match its fire and fearsome pull. Portman did most of her own dancing in ""Black Swan"" and while Aronofsky often shoots from the waist or shoulders up his penchant for lengthy inquisitive hand-held shots adds an intriguing edge to what we see whether its a dream or a rehearsal sequence ruled by the ballet companys imperious rake of a director (Cassel). ""Are you freaking out?"" Lily asks Nina after Ninas cast in the leading role. The answer is obvious even before Ninas obsessive transformation begins in earnest. Watching the film which unfolds like an extended hallucination I resisted some of the digital effects work in the transformation scenes. Elsewhere one too many shots recall ""The Wrestler"" in an obvious way. And even by the standards of overheated backstage disaster pictures some of the dialogue (""This role is destroying you"") settles for the wrong cliches as opposed to the right ones. These are small speed bumps in an otherwise propulsive movie. Co-screenwriter Mark Heyman has described it as a ""ballet thriller."" Aronofsky has only trace elements of wit as a filmmaker; hes more about pounding waves of intensity. But this is his most interesting film to date -- a steroidal melodrama built for speed motion and cinematic delirium. Theres not a more exciting fairy tale for grownups in theaters right now. mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating R (for strong sexual content disturbing violent images language and some drug use) Cast Natalie Portman (Nina); Mila Kunis (Lily); Barbara Hershey (Erica); Vincent Cassel (Thomas); Winona Ryder (Beth) Credits Directed by Darren Aronofsky; written by Mark Heyman Andres Heinz and John McLaughlin; produced by Mike Medavoy Arnold W.

"Black Swan | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; black-swan ) Black Swan (United States 2010) December 01 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Darren Aronofsky who used the cheesiness of professional wrestling as the backdrop for a powerful tragic character study has moved behind the scenes of another kind of performance. One doesnt often think of ballet with its graceful moves and untouchable sensuality as a blood sport but Aronofskys perspective argues that rasslin may not be that far removed from dancing. Black Swan is presented as a psychological thriller with a twist the viewers perspective is that of the lead character and her sanity is in doubt. As a result the films sense of reality is warped. Sorting fantasy nightmare and hallucination from what is real is likely to require multiple viewings and careful conjecture. Aronofsky has created a twisted piece of art - the kind of things that lovers of the ""mind fuck"" subgenre will delight in. Black Swan makes the contortions of Shutter Island and Inception seem facile by comparison. Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) is an aspiring top ballerina. The role she wants more than any other is that of the Swan Queen in a re-imagining of the ballet Swan Lake by impresario Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel). However while Ninas technical proficiency makes her the perfect choice for the White Swan she lacks the spontaneity and seductiveness necessary for the Black Swan. A good fit for that role is Lily (Mila Kunis) a new transplant from San Francisco who oozes sexuality. Ultimately Leroy selects Nina over Lily with the hope that his new top performer will grow into the role. But Nina is a psychological wreck. Not only is she paranoid that Lily is trying to undermine her but she has a confrontation with Leroys previous protA(c)gA(c) the damaged Beth Macintyre (Winona Ryder) and she lives under the thumb of a domineering overprotective mother (Barbara Hershey). Ninas attempts to get in touch with her darker side put pressure upon an already unstable psyche. If Black Swan had been told from a neutral perspective it might not be all that different from something along the lines of The Red Shoes (or Flashdance in a Tutu). However by presenting the action from inside the fractured mind of the lead character it has generated comparisons to some of Roman Polanskis early work (especially The Tenant and Repulsion). At times Black Swan comes across as a psychological thriller but it also contains elements of lurid melodrama and horror. And although there is no nudity the films frank sexuality (which includes masturbation and a lesbian tryst) edges it toward soft-core erotica. Still despite its many personalities Black Swan is at its heart very much an art film - and a dark one at that. It offers little in the way of concrete action or exposition and even after a second or third watching questions about whats real and what isnt remain. It would have been fascinating to see a Rashomon treatment to the story and understand events not only from Ninas perspective but from that of Leroy and Lily as well. Although Aronofsky has designated Black Swan as a ""companion piece"" to The Wrestler this feature is considerably more ambiguous than the earlier film which dealt with a straightforward albeit grim reality. With the way in which he toys with viewer perceptions the filmmaker references not only his blistering anti-drug effort Requiem for a Dream but also his feature debut Pi. Like The Wrestler this is in many ways a character piece the difference here being the lack of distance and objectivity used in representing Nina and her world. There are plenty of clues that what were seeing is badly skewed. Lily for example is inconsistently represented - the conniving rival the brazen seductress the hard-working ballerina with skill and passion but flawed technique. There are scenes in which the viewer senses hes observing the ""real"" Lily but most of the time she is what Nina makes her into and its rarely pleasant. It has been surmised that Natalie Portman will be a frontrunner for the 2011 Best Actress Oscar for her work in Black Swan and the expectations are deserved. This is among the best examples of acting on Portmans resume an instance in which she poured everything into the performance and allowed it to be transformative. Portraying Nina requires breadth and depth of emotion and Portman never strikes a wrong chord. Although I was more moved by her efforts in Closer this is the kind of risky and challenging endeavor often embraced by Academy voters. Additionally the effort she put into a several-months intense ballet training regimen pays off - Aronofsky indicated the only time he needed to employ a ""dance double"" was in wide shots. Most of Ninas dancing is performed by Portman and while its difficult to say shes flawless she is better than merely ""credible."" As Lily Mila Kunis exhibits the capacity of playing more than featherweight roles in comedies and light dramas. Required by the narrative approach to embody two or three different characters (because of the way in which Lily is perceived) Kunis differentiates the personalities while maintaining a link between them. Her performance exists in the shadow of Portmans but in its own way it is as impressive. Meanwhile Vincent Cassel fresh off his turn in the epic Mesrine is perfect as Leroy adding a dash of the dark and edgy to his roguishly charming personality. The look and feel of Black Swan which captures the essence of a major New York ballet production is one of Aronofskys great successes. But its not all about verisimilitude - something achieved not only through the tireless efforts of the actresses but through the directors study of real-life analogs. The cinematography is evocative using odd angles and sharp contrasts between black and white as well as incorporating shots that would be appropriate in any horror movie. Many scenes have a discordant feel which is what one might expect from a movie representing this point-of-view. As with The Wrestler the ending of Black Swan is open to interpretation. It is not cut-and-dry. In comparing the two films - an approach Aronofsky invites - its easy to see similarities in the characters arcs even though they are at different ends of the performance scale (ballet being ""high art"" and wrestling being ""low art""). However The Wrestler as a traditional tragedy evokes a more forceful emotional response. Black Swan is no less wrenching but the storytelling method paradoxically holds the viewer apart from Nina while offering the intimacy of her perspective. Mind-fuck movies are often like this investing more in intellectual intrigue than emotional fulfillment. So although Black Swan is the more ambitious motion picture one could argue that The Wrestler is more satisfying. Nevertheless I feel safe asserting that both are among the most compelling productions of their respective release years.

You cant take it too seriously but you cant tear your eyes away from it either. The movie is all about what happens to Nina (Natalie Portman) an ambitious repressed New York ballerina with the face of a saddened porcelain doll when she gets cast as the lead in a bold new production of Swan Lake. Nina is supposed to be a technically flawless dancer who lacks inner fire. Shes the ultimate overachieving student executing each movement with supreme by-the-book ""perfection"" which means shes ideal to play the saintly White Swan half of her role. But what Thomas (Vincent Cassel) the Balanchine-lite whip-cracking French leader of the troupe wants to know is Can Nina dance the part of the duplicitous seductive Black Swan as well? To find out he makes a pass at her -- and she fights him off by literally biting him back. That moment of angry rebellion is what nets her the role. It proves to Thomas that she can bring her inner Black Swan to life. But can she really? In virtuoso movies like Requiem for a Dream and The Wrestler Aronofsky has been drawn to characters who push themselves to extremes. So you may be seduced early on in Black Swan into thinking that youre seeing an in-depth feel-the-pain live-the-rush dance psychodrama -- a ballet film as the young Scorsese might have made it. Aronofsky shoots the entire movie with a handheld camera and his images have a burnished raw-silk night-world chic the shots weaving and bobbing as they follow Ninas bunned head through the stark halls of Lincoln Center. The director lingers on details of physical turmoil in much the same way he did in The Wrestler Theres a moment when Nina is dancing in her makeshift home studio and something goes crack -- it turns out to be her big toenail split in two and gushing blood. On stage the camera spins with Nina in a reverie of frenzied whirling elation. Its like an acid-trip version of The Red Shoes with male dancers morphing into feathered creatures -- a vision of dance as a dancer might experience it from the inside out not as detached observed movement but as a series of fluidly baroque exertions. Yet Aronofskys technique is far subtler than the story hes telling. Nina a girl in a grown womans body is surrounded by women who trump her in treachery. The snarling dressing-room bitchfests bring ballet into the age of claws-out princess culture and everywhere Nina looks theres another archetypal vixen-destroyer. Lily (Mila Kunis) the sexy new troupe member is a free spirit with wings tattooed on her back; she becomes Ninas friend confidante lover and rival all at once. Winona Ryder plays Beth the raging over-the-hill dancer whos cruelly put out to pasture. And Ninas mother Erica (Barbara Hershey) is a real piece of work an unhappy stage harridan out of Tennessee Williams whose dreams for her daughter are etched into the bitter melting beauty of her aging face. The two still live together in a cramped Upper West Side apartment where Nina barely has the privacy to indulge her sexual desires. To free herself she has to act out. The theme of Black Swan is the hidden violence of ballet -- the emotional violence and the physical violence too. Thats a great taking-off point for a dance melodrama but as Nina starts to become both victimized and liberated by her buried fantasies Black Swan turns out to be nothing more (or less) than a highfalutin what is real and whats not? horror film. Its Repulsion in toe shoes. Natalie Portman has never looked this severely lovely. In Black Swan shes an extraordinary camera object ghostly and possessed all sinewy alabaster will. Yet its part of the design of the movie that her performance remains quite passive. Nina keeps dancing like the metronomic good girl she is and Thomas continues to gripe that she doesnt have what it takes to play the Black Swan after all. Which makes you wonder Why did he even cast her? Or rather Why couldnt Aronofsky have chosen a far less diagrammatic bare-bones script? In its slightly psycho what-she-did-for-love way Black Swan touches a certain masochistic grandeur nestled within the erotic mystique of ballet. Yet the film is powered by enough conventional bloodbath theatrics to be in the end more shocking than ravishing.

Hoberman Natalie Portman Goes Batshit in a Tutu in Black Swan Wednesday December 1 2010 at 4 a.m. By J. Hoberman EXPAND Ballerina going to piecesNiko Tavernise A near-irresistible exercise in bravura absurdity Darren Aronofskys Black Swan deserves to become a minor classic of heterosexual camp--at the very least its the most risible and riotous backstage movie since Showgirls. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Tchaikovskys Swan Lake has had a spooky quality at least since Tod Browning appropriated a few bars of it to introduce his 1930 Dracula; Aronofsky takes that creep factor all the way to the moon. Not body but ballet horror Black Swan is a Red Shoes/Repulsion/Carrie mash-up slathered with Dario Argento cheese. At the same time the movie is recognizably Aronofskyian in its strenuous sensationalizing goofiness. This epic actualization myth is a distaff version of The Wrestler equally saturated in gore-soaked self-mutilating histrionics.Like The Wrestler Black Swan is an acting vehicle--it exists to document a highly physical totally immersive performance. Rather than fueling a geezerly comeback however the movie is propelled by Natalie Portmans game determination and near-excruciating anxiety as Nina a dogged delusional mildly masochistic possibly virginal and severely repressed little ballerina plucked from the ensemble to dance the Swan Queen and as is customary her evil twin in a new vision of Swan Lake concocted by the sleaziest ballet master to ever slime Lincoln Center (Vincent Cassel).Frequently heard to whimper that she just wants to be ""perfect"" Nina is one tense chick. But really who could blame her? Projecting her shadow all over the Upper West Side the tremulous child is stalked and brutalized onstage and off- as well as in her dreams; shes taunted by trolls and hobgoblins as she scurries home to the apartment-cum-haunted-house a veritable nursery for Rosemarys baby that she shares under the name ""Sweet Girl"" with her scary infantilizing mother (Barbara Hershey hair pulled tight to pop her eyes and so witchy she should be standing in a pool of Morticia Addams goo).Navigating the clattering subway of terror and twisted catacombs of Lincoln Center (surely built on the site of an ancient Indian burial ground and haunted by the souls of evicted tenants) Nina fights bravely for her role. She bites the ballet masters arrogantly curled lip and draws blood to get it; he then tells Nina to practice ""touching"" herself at home. The sweaty Sturm und Drang surrounding Sweet Girls first orgasm is a production number in itself. (Portman long ago displayed her dark side in Closer although admittedly she didnt have to pole dance en pointe.)Aronofsky has a near-documentary fascination with the minutiae of physical training but in the end Black Swan is all about penetration blood and psychosis. Mind games multiply en route to Ninas inevitable swan song. The prima ballerina that the youngster replaced (Winona Ryder) has cast a malign spell on her and Nina is beset by a sexually confident rival (Mila Kunis) from faraway San Francisco who tries to steal her part--or maybe her heart--during the course of an after-work ecstasy-crazed bacchanal. Even worse Nina is afflicted by mysterious running-sore stigmata some of it self-induced. Tormented by mirrored doppelgangers and her mothers expressionist canvases her brain is fried well before she goes totally goth-girl for the climactic walpurgisnacht.Black Swan is a hoot--even more so if one identifies Aronofsky with the haughty maestro who swans through the movie like a bobblehead cadaver--and compared to the ponderous pulp mysticism of The Fountain Aronofskys suffocatingly self-important attempt to out-kibitz the Kabbalah its surprisingly fluid. The wall-to-wall Tchaikovsky (and ""Tchaikovsky"") certainly helps but credit the filmmaker Despite (or perhaps thanks to) his shock cuts zap hallucinations off-kilter framing moody chiaroscuro and repetitive creepiness Black Swan is something like a 100-minute swoon. The camera lurches leaps and pirouettes; in some scenes it feels as if its being tossed around the stage along with Portman. Kitsch this bombastic becomes something primal.1 Niko Tavernise Ellen Page Kidnaps an Infant in Tallulah but She Means Well NEXT Contact J.

By David Denby Natalie Portman as a tormented dancer in Darren Aronofskys movie.   Credit Photograph by Niko Tavernise Darren Aronofskys ""Black Swan"" is a luridly beautiful farrago--a violent fantasia that mixes the tensions of preparing a new production of ""Swan Lake"" with sex blood and horror-film flourishes. Natalie Portman is Nina a soloist in a New York ballet company who lives with her mother (Barbara Hershey) a hysterically protective retired dancer and falls under the sway of the brilliant artistic director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel). In the story of Tchaikovskys ""Swan Lake"" an evil magician controls two beauties who are swans by day and women by night Odette the White Swan associated with purity and Odile the evilly seductive Black Swan who is the magicians daughter. Both roles are usually performed by a single dancer--its an extraordinary challenge. In the movie Thomas tells Nina that she has the talent and the temperament to dance the White Swan but that shes too frigid for the dark side. He becomes her sorcerer dominating and inflaming her caressing and coming on to her and Nina a virtuous hardworking girl begins to develop black-swan attributes. She appears to have a nasty double a second version of herself which she catches glimpses of here and there. She drinks takes drugs has sex. Rashes and abrasions appear on her back where wings might be; her toes web together; and she picks at her fingers until they bleed stigmatizing herself. At the same time another young dancer Lily (Mila Kunis) also appears to have two personalities a friendly one who encourages Nina; and a predatory one who wants to destroy her and dance the Odette/Odile role herself. Nina moves toward opening night in a panic still not sure if Thomas will let her dance. Freud said that meeting ones doppelganger in life or in dreams produces sensations of the uncanny but isnt one double enough? This movie has three sets theres also the washed-up ballerina (played in a cruel bit of casting by Winona Ryder) who previously danced the role and whom Nina tries to emulate--she steals lipstick from her dressing room--as well as replace. Actually there are four if you count Ninas mother with whom Nina shares a clammily intimate relationship and the same pulled-back hair and clenched manner. ""Black Swan"" turns Freuds uncanny into shtick; the sinister elements are overloaded and overdetermined. After a while you realize that the film is a case of ersatz formalism disguising chaos. For instance the ""All About Eve"" business with dancers preying on one another was retained from a discarded screenplay by Andres Heinz who worked on the final version of ""Black Swan"" with Mark Heyman and John J. McLaughlin. As a device its clunky and redundant. So are the repeated scenes of Nina entering her Upper West Side apartment which becomes a house of demons and a freezing wash of horror-film sounds that play again and again. The Grand Guignol can be understood as an invasion of the supernatural into a dancers life or as the delusions of an ambitious young perfectionist. Aronofsky has it both ways aestheticizing insanity and playing scare-movie tricks at the same time. The film is often ridiculous yet there are startlingly beautiful sequences; right at the beginning Nina dances under a spotlight in a white tutu against a vibrant black background. Aronofsky working with the cinematographer Matthew Libatique and the designer Therese DePrez has produced the hard glitter of an old mirrored music box. The filmmakers use four principal colors representing the psychological and physical moods of the story white black pink (the color of the stuffed animals in Ninas bedroom) and gash red. This crazed aestheticism has its own kind of passion. ""Black Swan"" certainly isnt bland like ""The Turning Point""; instead it bears some resemblance in spirit to the death-haunted ""Red Shoes."" Aronofsky understands and reproduces the controlled savagery of ballet--the stressed flaring emotionalism of young dancers the wracking spiritual and physical demands made on breakable bodies. He films the dancing with a circling weaving bobbing camera that seems to be moving (almost dancing itself) in rhythm with the music. The performance sequences at their best come close to ecstasy while the rehearsal sequences are disciplined and businesslike. Off the dance floor however ""Black Swan"" is trashy and incoherent. Aronofsky for all his gifts is a gaudy maestro opportunistic and insecure as an artist. Almost every sequence is shot with a handheld camera and poor Nina cant go anywhere--not even down a corridor--without the camera stalking her. Aronofsky keeps us in a state of anxiety from beginning to end. Hes such an extremist that he never creates a normal reality to take off from so the outbreaks of violence dont shock as much as they might. As Thomas the French star Vincent Cassel is a portrait of studliness (even his nose is virile). Tall and straight he has a superb presence; he blusters through the role and gets away with it. Natalie Portman has a sinewy dancers body and the control and the single-mindedness to play a driven unhappy girl. With her perfect features she also has the taut masklike beauty that so many female dancers attain. Portman has been dancing since she was a child and aided by some digital finishing she does well enough in the ballet sequences. That is she doesnt make a fool of herself which given the possible comparisons is saying a great deal. But Aronofsky has coaxed her into giving a dolorous performance thats often on the verge of caricature. She suppresses tears then trembles cries crumples--shes always collapsing--and her neck chords stand out like ships rigging. Cold-eyed viewers will see ""Black Swan"" less as a movie about ballet than as a movie about the torture of a young woman. Dance lovers will find it so over the top that they are likely to be amused. The picture is too bizarre to be a desecration of ""Swan Lake"" which is as indestructible as ""Macbeth."" ""Black Swan"" says that a dancer must enter into the irrational and the erotic--even destroy herself--in order to make art. That is if you dont get laid and you arent ready to kill your rival or yourself you cant be a great dancer. But the directors erotic and punitive notion of art is his own obsession not a dancers. His movies are about people destroying their bodies the drug addicts in ""Requiem for a Dream"" (2000) Mickey Rourke razoring his flesh in ""The Wrestler"" (2008). In ""Black Swan"" Aronofsky goes all the way with his taste for mutilation. He imposes his own bloodlust on a womans mind and then turns her into a myth of sacrifice. ""Black Swan"" is a pompous self-glorifying and generally unpleasant interpretation of an artists task. The movie has the Romantics fascination with death without their spiritual eloquence which turns morbidity into art. ""Black Swan"" is every bit as beautiful as a tray of Russian Easter eggs. Maybe someone should crack one of them on Aronofskys noggin and bring him to his senses. Jake Gyllenhaal has played his share of melancholy young men but in ""Love and Other Drugs"" set in the nineteen-nineties his eyes and body are alive and hes active in bed both as a pleasure and as a professional aid. He plays Jamie Randall a self-hating but flirtatious and irresistible pharmaceutical rep for Pfizer. He and his mentor Bruce (Oliver Platt) besiege clinics and doctors hoping to persuade them to prescribe Pfizers Zoloft rather than Lillys Prozac. (They dont have much trouble getting them to take on Viagra.) The movie directed by Ed Zwick and written by Charles Randolph Marshall Herskovitz and Zwick who adapted a memoir by Jamie Reidy has some broadly played but knowing satirical sequences of drug reps trying to seduce medical secretaries and bribing and pimping for doctors. Then suddenly the movie shifts away from satire Jamie meets Maggie Murdock (Anne Hathaway) a beautiful young woman with early-onset Parkinsons who likes sex but doesnt want love since she knows her condition will impose an unmanageable burden on any man who falls for her. Hathaways features are so big and bright that they seem to take over her face; she can look like a clown in some shots and ravishing in others. But shes not just vivid and generously expressive; she has become in her last few roles a high-flying actress who reveals everything thats inside her characters. Through sheer conviction she makes the defiant-dying-girl tearjerking cliches work. And her sex scenes with Gyllenhaal are the most intimate and erotic glimpses of romantic love that weve seen in American movies in years. The two of them lounge naked in bed talking making love finessing a scene of Jamies impotence that could have been embarrassing but becomes genuinely funny. ""Love and Other Drugs"" has many weak spots but what it delivers at its core is as indelible as (and a lot more explicit than) the work of such legendary teams as Clark Gable and Joan Crawford Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn.

By David Edelstein Published Nov 28 2010 ShareThis Natalie Portman on the set of Black Swan.  (Photo Ray Lewis) In The Wrestler Darren Aronofsky crafted a battering ode to male masochism to the notion that one is truly ecstatically alive on the brink of self-obliteration. And now for the perfect insanity-inducing double bill comes that films female counterpart Black Swan. The protagonist is Nina a New York ballerina played (and largely danced) by Natalie Portman. She is still in essence a girl sexually immature living with an infantilizing mother (Barbara Hershey) surrounded in her pink bedroom by stuffed animals. Shes also a serial puker who scratches herself until she bleeds a spirit in limbo. Nina is a candidate to play the Swan Queen in Tchaikovskys Swan Lake but her companys artistic director (Vincent Cassel) maintains shes suited only for half the double role. She is the very embodiment of the innocent White Swan who kills herself for love. But for the dark demonic twin Nina is sadly lacking in life experience. Like a Method-acting guru he lectures her on letting go losing herself surrendering completely to her sexuality. Watch the Video A Drunken Winona Ryder Accosts Natalie Portman in Our Exclusive Clip Black Swan dramatizes that surrender and its overpowering side effects and it plays like a Roman Polanski remake of Showgirlswith dollops of other Gothic/Grand Guignol filmmakers David Lynch (lifes a dream) David Cronenberg (lifes a dream that makes icky things sprout from your flesh) Brian De Palma (lifes a voyeuristic tracking shot) and even that Italian giallo maestro Dario Argento (lifes a dark mirror that will shatter and slash you). The camera follows about a foot behind Ninas slender neck as the settings change and doppelgangers pop up left and right. The movies epitaph could be Double double toil and trouble. Although Nina tells the director that her goal is perfection she doesnt really mean artistic perfection. In The Company Robert Altman moved back and forth between physical (and emotional) punishment and sublime ballets but Aronofsky isnt remotely interested in celebrating the Dance. Black Swan is full of scary-looking emaciated women their dark hair severely pulled back twisting and cracking their limbs and toespuppets of a tyrannical male deity. Even before Nina begins to unravel the dances are shot by a camera that seems to be shuddering in horror. Aronofsky has one overriding aim to get past the blood-brain barrier and give you a drug experience. In his first feature Pi an obsession with a mathematical equation caused a stroke while pills and smack dictated the fractured syntax of Requiem for a Dream. In The Fountain he even made love a lethal intoxicant. Aronofsky is enough of a virtuoso to bring that aesthetic off but its a painfully constricted vision and like most drug experiences it leaves little behind but a hangover. At their worst his films suggest that theres a thin line between the hypnotic and the stupefying. Portman gives the kind of performance that wins awards largely because youre so aware of her sacrifices to play the part. She looks as if she trained hard and for an actress she dances wellalthough not brilliantly or distinctively enough to convince you that the company director would single her out. Toward the end of Black Swan her face is all bone and hollows like a shrunken head; it comes as a relief to gaze (too briefly) on the full rounded features of Mila Kunis as Ninas insinuating fake-solicitous rival. Meanwhile Hersheys tight face emblemizes another more Hollywood brand of female insecurity and masochism. Aronofsky cast Winona Ryder as the aging prima ballerina whom Nina replaces and I couldnt help but think he was exploiting her reputation as an increasingly unstable ingenue who crashed and burned. The movie is full of casualtiesthey could all win awards. Black Swan is crushingly obvious from its first frame to its exultant final whiteout with poor Cassel having to utter variations of the same exhortation in every scene. (When he directs Nina to go home and touch herself Aronofsky makes sure we see the giant stuffed bunny near her bed.) But this is no doubt about it a tour de force a work that fully lives up to its directors ambitions. It takes a long time to purge Tchaikovsky from your head You exit pursued by a swan. Theres not enough Tchaikovsky in Andrei Konchalovskiys The Nutcracker in 3D which has so many terrible ideas that the terrible execution is almost irrelevant Even if the film were well done it would still be a travesty. Start with the notion of reducing the amount of dance to about 45 seconds axing most of the score and writing lyrics for whats left which is mostly iterations of Dance of the Sugarplum Fairy. Go on Try singing somethinganythingto Dance of the Sugarplum Fairy and see how awkwardly it sits (or stumbles) on the tongue. The lyricist Tim Rice squeezes two songs out of that overfamiliar piece the first Its All Relative sung by a miserable-looking Nathan Lane as the childrens mysterious uncle. Said uncle is now for no reason I can discern Albert Einstein. Nothing like trimming the Christmas tree with your Jewish relatives. 1 2 Next Share this story...

(Tony Fitts)By Steven Rea Inquirer Movie CriticPosted October 14 2010I had the craziest dream last night about a girl who was turned into a swan"" Natalie Portman says tremulously in the early going of Black Swan.But it cant possibly be as crazy as the Darren Aronofsky dream that follows for the next 100 minutes.The director of The Wrestler has with Portman as his fragile fantastic collaborator crafted a ballet movie that is also a psy-chological horror story and a scary reverie about obsession and paranoia. Black Swan opens the 19th Philadelphia Film Festival on Thursday night reprises Saturday and will be released locally on Dec. 10.Wild and woolly the movie is a breathtaking head trip that hails from a long tradition of backstage melodramas 42nd Street A Star Is Born All About Eve and yes that kitschy 90s relic Showgirls.That Aronofskys Black Swan takes place in the rarefied spheres of the dance world - with its thoroughbred ballerinas sinewy and high-strung - makes the nutty psychodrama somehow all the more intriguing.Here is Nina (Portman) wrapped in a fluffy scarf stepping from the subway and trooping off to rehearsals at Lincoln Center. Her whole life revolves around dance. Theres a music-box ballerina in her bedroom - a bedroom still filled with the plush toys of her childhood a bedroom in a cramped apartment she shares with her mother (Barbara Hershey) herself a dancer so many years before.A new production of Swan Lake - stripped-down primal ""real"" - is on the seasons slate and the companys artistic director Thomas Leroy (French actor Vincent Cassel) is looking for a new Odette/Odile to fill the pointe shoes left by his retiring prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre (a just-this-side-of-camp Winona Ryder). Fiercely disciplined Nina seems perfect for the part of the innocent elegant White Swan but Leroy expresses concerns that she doesnt have the sensuality the slyness to play her darker doppelganger.Enter a new member to the troupe Lilly (a cagey sexy Mila Kunis) just in from San Francisco. Shes as uninhibited and earthy as Nina is tamped-down and tightly wound. Its clear that Leroy sees star potential there.Will Nina get the role? Will Lilly? Are Leroys motives purely artistic? Are Lillys overtures to Nina a guileless signal of friendship or some sinister plot to usurp her position in the company?Portman in the role of her career oozes anxiety and aching loneliness. Here is a young woman overwhelmed by her dreams and ambitions sexually repressed smothered by her mother and in physical pain from the intense regimen of dance. But also in self-inflicted pain She picks and claws her body apart like a dog gnashing at itself.If you thought the bloody stuff Mickey Rourkes character subjected himself to in The Wrestler was tough (remember the staple gun?) Portmans Nina puts herself through even more torture and torment. Black Swan is at times exceedingly difficult to watch.And then there are moments when you just cant help but laugh. And that seems fine.Portman shot mostly in closeup and mid-range appears to be doing much of the dance work herself and ably. Members of the Pennsylvania Ballet lend verisimilitude and artistry to the proceedings and the staging of Swan Lakes climactic scenes truly a transcendent fusion of music dance and cinema is thrilling to behold.Thrilling indeed. And brazenly beautifully crazy.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

The Globe and Mail Published Saturday Sep. 18 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Aug. 23 2012 423PM EDT Comments Print /License AA The following short reviews of some of the films screening on Saturday Sept. 18 at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival are by James Adams James Bradshaw Guy Dixon Rick Groen Liam Lacey Gayle MacDonald Dave McGinn J. Kelly Nestruck Johanna Schneller and Brad Wheeler. The star ratings are out of four. 127 Hours Danny Boyle (USA) 4 STARS The Oscar-winning directors film is based on the true story of Aron Ralston an avid outdoorsman who has a freak accident and finds himself trapped in a deep crevasse his right hand crushed under a boulder in the canyons around Moab Utah. In the hands of a less skilled craftsman the story - one man little dialogue in a crammed space - could have been a snore. But with the same deft touch sensitivity rapid-fire editing and superb score he brought to Slumdog Millionaire Boyle turns the near-death tale into a riveting re-enactment that will keep audiences squirming in their seats. James Franco gives a brilliant nuanced performance as Ralston a young man who tries every means at his disposal to move the rock before he makes the one decisive act - the self-amputation of his own forearm - to get back to the family he loves. G.M. Sept. 18 6 p.m. Bell Lightbox 1 Henrys Crime Malcolm Venville (USA) 2 STARS Henry (Keanu Reeves) lives a dull life. He works as a highway toll-booth operator in Buffalo. He stares blankly at everything even when his wife raises the idea of having a baby. So when he is sent to prison for a bank robbery he did not commit Henry sees it as an escape. While Henry is in prison his cellmate Max (James Caan) convinces him that ""if youve done the time you might as well do the crime."" Henry leaves jail intent on robbing the bank with Maxs help. He is now a man with a purpose. But when Henry meets an amateur actress played by Vera Farmiga and soon begins acting alongside her in a Chekhov play he must choose between following through on his plan or following his heart. As a heist movie that is also a romantic comedy Henrys Crime fails at both with little tension to the robbery and few laughs throughout. It will leave you with the same blank stare Henry comes home from work with. D.M. Sept. 18 530 p.m. Varsity 8 Cave of Forgotten Dreams Werner Herzog (USA) 3 STARS Hidden in a limestone cliff in the south of France lies the rarest oldest possibly most intellectually fascinating artwork ever found. Werner Herzog took a camera crew equipped with 3-D cameras into the heavily protected Chauvet Cave which contains what is believed to be the oldest cave paintings drawn some 35000 years ago. Because of the caves delicate environment no other film crew is expected to be allowed in again. Part documentary part scientific footage Herzogs film lingers on the mesmerizing drawings produced incredibly when prehistoric animals still roamed the Earth and Neanderthals were still a competing human species. A historic invaluable film. G.D. Sept. 18 9 p.m. Bell Lightbox 1 The Promise The Making of Darkness on the Edge of Town Thom Zimny (USA) 3 STARS Using unearthed footage from recording sessions and home rehearsals from 1976-78 as well as new interviews the making of Bruce Springsteens raw-powered album Darkness on the Edge of Town is explored in depth. Starting with a lawsuit that delayed the sessions and continuing with Springsteens unwavering pursuit for the albums lean hardened sound Darkness was epic in its making if not in its result. Where 1975s grander Born to Run celebrated escape and youthful abandon Darkness had Springsteen dealing with the limitations of adulthood. With an unvarnished illuminating film on the creative process of an iconic artist director Zimny matches his subjects dogged focus. B.W. Sept. 18 630 p.m. and 845 p.m. Scotiabank 1 Im Still Here Casey Affleck (USA) 1 STAR For an hour and a half or so Casey Afflecks experimental ""documentary"" on his brother-in-law Joaquin Phoenixs apparent breakdown manages to keep the viewer trying to follow this ontological shell game Whats real? Whats pretend? Purportedly this is a documentary following Phoenixs decision to quit acting and become a rapper as he goes through a drug-assisted mental breakdown. Or is it possibly an Andy Kaufman-like performance-art piece in which the actor pretended to become unhinged as a demonstration of our toxic and dehumanizing celebrity culture? On the reality side Phoenix seems genuinely messed up and most of the movie involves a series of awkward encounters between him and people who arent sure how to act. Evidence of fakery includes selectively blurry shots actors cast in some roles and Phoenix and Affleck credited as writers. Verdict? Possibly its a whole new genre - the focumentary. L.L.

By Joe Morgenstern Updated Dec. 3 2010 1201 a.m. ET Fine actors can reveal complex feelings in a flash. One of those flashes illuminates ""Black Swan"" moments after the heroine a ballet dancer named Nina Sayers learns that her companys artistic director has chosen her to play the Swan Queen in his ambitious new production of ""Swan Lake."" Flipping open her cellphone Nina cries ""He picked me Mommy"" In a single poignant sentence stripped of artifice Natalie Portman tells us everything we need to know about Ninas passion her immaturity her relationship with her mother and her frightening vulnerability. The director Darren Aronofsky uses all the artifice in his arsenal to portray the terrors that beset Nina in her pursuit of perfection. As she dances on the border between sanity and madness he blurs the line between reality and fantasy turning the film into a gothic horror show that is fascinating and disappointing in equal measure. Whats resplendently real though is the beauty of Ms. Portmans performance. She makes the whole lurid tale worthwhile. In the venerable tradition of ""The Red Shoes"" the ballet provides the template for the offstage drama. The film begins with the prologue to ""Swan Lake"" in which the sorcerer Rothbart casts his evil spell. Hes not the only evil sorcerer of the piece and winning a plum role isnt Ninas triumph its the start of her woes. The artistic director Thomas (Vincent Cassel) considers her ideal casting for the part of the White Swan--innocent fragile fearful--but not as he tells her repeatedly for the lustful Black Swan. That means she must learn about lust from him or risk the role being reassigned to her rival Lily. (Shes played by Mila Kunis who makes evil entertaining.) ENLARGE Natalie Portman as a troubled dancer in Black Swan. Fox Searchlight Mr. Cassel has long been a formidable force in French films and his presence here is a strong one but under the spell of the movies director its also a heavy and graceless one. Thomas is Mr. Aronofskys point man for horror though far from its only source. Barbara Hersheys portrayal of Ninas mother Erica transcends horrifying to become a tour de force of Grand Guignol and all of it in the spirit of imprisoning infantilizing love. Erica sacrificed her own negligible career as a dancer to motherhood and then to Ninas advancement. Now each time she calls her anguished daughter ""You sweet girl"" your flesh crawls just as its supposed to. And your heart aches as its supposed to at the sight of Nina whos a world-class self-punisher trying to please everyone in her life while shes being pressured and threatened--or so she imagines--on all sides ""I just want to be perfect"" she whispers to Thomas pleadingly. The touching simplicity of Ms. Portmans technique gives her character a genuine innocence. Whats more the actress dances the ballet sequences elegantly. Her work is enhanced to be sure by the limited use of a dance double and by Matthew Libatiques gorgeously fluid cinematography but the illusion is as perfect as anything Nina could have hoped for. So whats to complain about? Basically--and increasingly as the film wears on--the psychological banalities of the script which was written by Mark Heyman Andres Heinz and John McLaughlin and the disappointing familiarity of the filmmakers horror tropes. Mr. Aronofskys audiences have watched and welcomed plenty of punishment from ""Requiem for a Dream"" which expressed the horrors of heroin addiction through dazzling images to hallucinatory effect up to ""The Wrestler"" with Mickey Rourke in spectacular agony. ""Black Swan"" can be dazzling too and not only thanks to its central performance. The craftsmanship is impressive the music is powerful and the movie is never uninteresting. This time though the creep-show component isnt worthy of the theme. ENLARGE Jim Carrey as Steven Russell in I Love You Phillip Morris. Roadside Attractions I Love You Phillip Morris Theres never been a movie like this one. Thats not to say its all good or all bad though its never indifferent. Much of it is funny or affecting in surprising ways while some of it is undercut by a wildly hyperbolic style. And the production is nothing if not forthright in its depiction of gay sex. But the films singular distinction is its zest for thematic cross-dressing. ""I Love You Phillip Morris"" is tragedy or something close to it decked out in comedys clothes. (Glenn Ficarra and John Requa directed from their adaptation of a book by Steve McVicker.) Jim Carrey plays Steven Russell a comedic version of a real-life con man who came out sexually in midlife and who is currently confined to a cell in a Texas prison where hes serving a 144-year sentence for escape and fraud. (A title-sequence claimer as opposed to a disclaimer reads ""This really happened. It really did."") Ewan McGregor is Phillip Morris a prisoner who becomes the one true love of Stevens life. His love for Phillip is the only constant amidst emotional and situational pandemonium. Stevens life is a downward spiral of loony escapades outlandish impersonations that sometimes succeed albeit temporarily and preposterous exploits that unlike those of Walter Mitty end consistently in failure. Watch a clip from Roadside Attractions ""I Love You Phillip Morris"" starring Jim Carrey and Ewan McGregor. The role seems tailor-made for Mr. Carreys outlandish talents although the close fit becomes a problem when some of those exploits sacrifice all traces of plausibility in the course of showcasing the movies star. (I never believed a moment of one faux-naive sequence a cross between ""Forrest Gump"" and ""Being There"" in which Steven pretending to be a lawyer defends a woman in court.) Yet the funnyman is at his best when the going gets unfunny. The heros antics proceed from his pain; he never knew who he was as an adopted child and he still doesnt know. But the film allows us to feel that we do. Steven is a good person with sociopathic impulses a man whos been struggling all his life to find himself and to be a true lover. By the end hes batting .500. Night Catches Us Any film with Anthony Mackie and Kerry Washington demands attention. Shes always appealing and hes one of Americas great actors even if his only widely recognized film role was as a member of the three-man bomb squad in ""The Hurt Locker."" This film which was written and directed by Tanya Hamilton merits admiration as an ambitious debut feature though the impact of its splendid cast is blunted by the awkward structure of its screenplay. (David Tumblety did the richly nuanced cinematography.) The story is set in 1976 when Mr. Mackies Marcus returns to the Philadelphia neighborhood where hed been involved in the Black Panthers a decade before Ms. Washington plays Patricia the woman he loved. The nature of Marcuss involvement is still mysterious but the larger issue on the filmmakers mind is the nature of the Black Power movement which remains clouded in controversy. ""We dont talk about the past"" Patricia warns Marcus. ""Its too painful."" ENLARGE Jamara Griffin and Anthony Mackie in the 1970s-set drama Night Catches Us. Magnolia Pictures ""Night Catches Us""--an evocative title--uses Marcus to investigate that past even though the initial investigator is Patricias young daughter Iris; shes as fascinated as she is baffled by her familys history. The movie intercuts present action with news clips and still montages from the earlier era as well as animated snippets from political comic books whose provenance proves surprising. (The animation represents the workings of Iriss imagination.) Unfortunately all of these flashbacks dominate the film in a semicoherent way that Ms. Hamilton could not have intended. ""Youre living in the past"" Marcus tells Patricia. ""This house this neighborhood youre all fighting imaginary enemies."" Thats the problem in a nutshell. Present action is in desperately short supply. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD FOCUS ENLARGE Pi (1998) The gritty black-and-whiteness of Darren Aronofskys first feature recalls another visionary debut David Lynchs ""Eraserhead."" This one could be called ""Numberhead."" Its about Max a math genius who goes mad searching for patterns in the stock market. (Right the movie is pure fantasy.) But filthy lucre isnt the heros goal any more than a conventional sci-fi story is Mr. Aronofskys goal. Max is looking for the secret of the universe while the writer-director seeks and finds a dialectic between human emotion (mostly bleak) and deadpan Dada that also recalls Jean-Luc Godards ""Alphaville"" and Terry Gilliams retro technology in ""Brazil."" Eternal Sunshine Of the Spotless Mind (2004) A romantic comedy unlike any other this gorgeous phantasmagoria takes a question thats been posed by poets across the ages--of what is love compounded?--and examines it through fanciful scans of a scorned lovers cortex. Jim Carreys shy guy Joel receives a notice from a mysterious company Lacuna Inc. that his flaky girlfriend Clementine has chosen to have all memories of him erased from her brain. Shes played memorably by Kate Winslet. Michel Gondry directed from an original script by Charlie Kaufman. Jon Brion wrote the music. Ellen Kuras guided the gliding see-all camera. Our Song (2000) Kerry Washington made her feature debut in Jim McKays lovely little feature about the friendship of three teenage girls. The setting is Crown Heights a mainly black and Latino section of Brooklyn. The best moments are those in which the girls give voice to gnawing fears vague dreams and ardent hopes. One of them Maria (Melissa Martinez) is pregnant and adrift. Another Joycelyn or Joy (Anna Simpson) believes in her forlorn fairy-tale way that she could be Miss Universe if she wanted to be. Ms. Washingtons Lani has her life most nearly together; shes the trios candidate for success. --Joe Morgenstern Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Jason Bourne Whats Happened So Far?

""Evidently Natalie Portman already has this years Academy Award for best actress all sewn up"" wrote Jan Chaney in the Posts Celebritology 2.0 column. ""At least the media buzz coming out of the Venice Film Festival -- where her Black Swan just premiered -- is making it sound that way."" In fact most of the early reviews while enthusiastic about Darren Aronofskys psychological thriller and Portmans performance as a ballerina who must face down demons when given the lead role in Swan Lake stopped short of Oscar predictions. The Times of Londons Kevin Maher came closest ""Portman is astounding ... Awards are sure to follow."" Ive also heard from folks at Venice who think Black Swan is a junky horror show and Portman way too strident. Me Im of two minds about a movie that wants to be a nail-ripping thriller and a statement on an artists unholy communion with her role. Its reminiscent of older better movies the late-40s backstage dramas A Double Life (Ronald Colman plays Othello and becomes fatally jealous of his actress ex-wife) and the classic ballet melodrama The Red Shoes; and of films about tender troubled psyches -- I wont say which ones -- by Roman Polanski Dario Argento Brian De Palma David Cronenberg and David Fincher. Black Swan also takes a view of women that might kindly be described as old-fashioned. (See pictures from Natalie Portmans career.) But opinion is almost beside the point here. Journalists know that sticking the magic word Oscar in a headline is a cheap effective way of getting attention for a film they like and for themselves. No self-respecting critic would sink that low. A side beneficiary of the heavy touting for Portman by the relative few whove seen the movie and the legions who havent is Venice. The worlds oldest continuing film festival now in its 67th session is also perhaps the least appreciated of the mediums major annual bashes. Critics from all over the world go to Cannes and Toronto but Venice coming just a week before the Canadian fest gets ignored by North American reviewers. So for a decade the received wisdom has been that the Oscar season begins in Toronto. Yet in just the past five years such Academy favorites as Brokeback Mountain The Queen Michael Clayton The Wrestler and The Hurt Locker had their world premieres on the Lido the swank island thats a 12-min. vaporetto ride from St. Marks Square. This is surely the snuggest and most congenial of the top film festivals so if some of Portmans acclaim rubs off on Venice thats fine. Two years ago Aronofsky copped the festivals first prize the Golden Lion for The Wrestler another study of an athlete-actor who tests himself brutally to stay in the game. At the Venice press conference the director said he was struck by the similarities between wrestlers and dancers ""They both have these performers who use their bodies in extremely physical ways."" They punish themselves for their art. Actors do too; if they dont an ambitious director will. As Aronofsky imposed a strict regimen on Mickey Rourke for his role as Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson so did he prod Portman into six months of exercise and ballet training. Though she has a dance double for certain shots Portman is physically plausible in the role both in her bodys newly sinewy contours and in the glimpses we get of her at the ballet. (See pictures of the glitz at 2008s Venice Film Festival.) Black Swan asks the 29-year-old star to do two things that havent been much demanded of her dance and act. Her strong delicate beauty has dazzled Hollywood ever since she made a splash at 13 playing a gunmans adopted waif in The Professional but her performances have been variable at best. Excellent in projects directed by Mike Nichols (a naive volcanically lovelorn Nina in the 2001 Central Park production of The Seagull; part of the quartet of broken lovers in the 2004 film Closer) Portman can also look utterly stranded on screen -- bereft of an actors most rudimentary tools -- in say Amos Gitais Free Zone or as George Lucas lamentable Queen Padme. Her turn in Black Swan if it truly impresses American moviegoers wont be the sort that caps the steady maturing of a gifted actress. It will have the shock of the new. That helps explain the outbreak of rapture among some critics here for Black Swan is among other things a document of Portmans obsessive dedication to give a performance beyond what is expected of her -- and no less Aronofskys need to wring every raw feeling from his leading lady. That relationship is up on screen too of a man trying to get a brilliant performance out of a young woman by dominating and manipulating her. In the Black Swan script by Andres Heinz and Mark Heyman Nina (Portman) is a member of the corps at a prime New York ballet company. Thomas Leroy (the excellent Vincent Cassel) the companys Balanchine-like choreographer is about to stage his own version of Swan Lake which will emphasize a womans tragic duality. One dancer is to incarnate both the pure White Swan and her evil sensual twin the Black Swan. Nina sweet and driven has the technique to play both roles but the temperament for only one. ""I just want to be perfect"" she says and Thomas counters ""Perfection is also about letting go."" He gives her the part anyway believing he can find the Black Swan within her. He goads Nina (""The only person standing in your way is you"") and insults her (""You could be brilliant but youre a coward""). He tries arousing her with a kiss and if that doesnt work (""That was me seducing you"" he says afterward ""when it should have been the other way around"") hell give her ""a little homework assignment ... go home and just touch yourself."" (Ninas bedroom masturbation scene has caused some avid commentary on the Internet.) And as she probes to both summon her own Black Swan and control it she begins to suspect that she is cursed haunted pursued by someone or something. When she is alone lights suddenly flick out; menacing figures seep out of the shadows; she emerges from a bathroom stall to see the accusation ""WHORE"" scrawled on the mirror. Getting a leading role is a freaking nightmare. (See 10 questions with Natalie Portman.) Three suspects -- all women all dancers -- quickly emerge Ninas suffocating mother Erica (Barbara Hershey) with whom she lives never got out of the corps and blames the girl for ""the career I gave up to have you."" Beth (Winona Ryder) the companys longtime prima ballerina has been consigned by Thomas to early retirement; she blames Nina for filching her position. Lily (Mila Kunis) fresh from San Francisco lacks Ninas technique but has a passion Thomas responds to. Now No. 1 Nina feels Lilys hot breath on her neck as either her successor or her seducer. To put showbiz competition in All About Eve terms every Margo Channing must have an Eve Harrington. Before she was cast as the Swan Queen Nina was the up-and-coming Eve; now shes Margo the uneasy star. Rivalry envy the bloom of maturity followed by the clocks tick of mortality -- they all come with the star on the door. But would any woman try to drive another woman to madness or death to achieve career satisfaction? To put it another way Is Nina paranoid or persecuted? (Its possible to be both.) Theres a piquancy in seeing Portman who succeeded Ryder in adorably intense elf roles fill a similar function here and theres also the rare and pleasing spectacle of four Jewish actresses getting to emote like mad in the same movie. Gee its a real womans movie and not one of those strenuous heart-warmers about female companionship and compromise. Black Swan isnt an advance. Its a throwback in three ways. First to what Freud called ""the return of the repressed"" -- that repressed desires created severe neuroses. Second to the Method cult notion of empathizing with a character until you become it. (As Laurence Olivier legendarily told Dustin Hoffman when the younger star was agonizing over his motivation in the tooth-drilling sequence of Marathon Man ""Dear boy why not just try acting?"") Third and most reductively to the ancient commandments of the horror genre which teach that a young woman is either a virgin whos pure enough to fight the demon or a whore who somehow deserves to be killed (especially when shes just had sex). The idea of a healthy eroticism is alien to these films; they allow no middle ground. Im pretty sure this is a guys idea of a womans sexuality. Black Swan had women in front of the camera men as the director and writers and cinematographer. The young Aronofsky made three startling status-quo-smashing movies Pi Requiem for a Dream and The Fountain. Whatever glory he won for The Wrestler that film was lazy visually and cliched in its telling. Black Swan is much more sophisticated using The Wrestlers stalking camera and grainy images but bringing sensational dexterity to the dance scenes. As for Portmans work if not fully convincing its wondrously committed -- yes just the sort of daredevil achievement the Academy loves to reward. Still Id hold off on Oscar promises (except in headlines) until we see whether the last months of 2010 bring us any great performances not just great stunts.

TWITTER First there was the Phantom of the Opera. Now in Darren Aronofskys ""Black Swan"" you get the Terror of the Ballet. The movie combines horror-movie tropes with The Red Shoes All About Eve and every movie about show business that insists you dont have to be crazy to become a star but it doesnt hurt either. The movie is so damn out-there in every way that you cant help admiring Aronofsky for daring to be so very very absurd. Swan is an instant guilty pleasure a gorgeously shot visually complex film whose badness is whats so good about it. You might howl at the sheer audacity of mixing mental illness with the body-fatiguing mind-numbing rigors of ballet but its lurid imagery and a hellcat competition between two rival dancers is pretty irresistible. Certain to divide audiences Swan wont lack for controversy but will any of this build an audience? Dont bet against it. Swan bears a resemblance to Aronofskys most recent film The Wrestler. Its battered lonely protagonist was a pro wrestler who drags his weary body into the ring night after night because thats what he is -- a wrestler. Same with Natalie Portmans Nina a sinewy thin slip of a ballerina whose body actually cracks loudly while getting out of bed. But she heads into the dance studio every day to pirouette on bloody toes and strain every muscle in her body. Because thats what she does. Only Aronofsky suggests right from an opening dream sequence that Nina might be cracking up. He keeps the camera close to his heroine not just so objects and people can suddenly loom next to her as in all horror flicks but to suggest a certain amount of paranoia and claustrophobia. Nina lives with an emotionally smothering mother played by Barbara Hershey in as unflattering makeup hairstyle and lighting as possible. Mom hovers obsessively over her daughter watching everything from her diet to nervous habits like scratching her skin until it bleeds. However as with any of the lurid visions in this movie -- bloody nails breaking bones puncture wounds nasty sutures -- youre never quite sure how real they are. They could be figments of Ninas fervid imagination. A New York ballet companys artistic director Thomas (Vincent Cassel the only unambiguous character in the film) selects Nina for the double role of the White Swan and Black Swan in his provocative new take on that old war horse ""Swan Lake."" He knows Nina can nail the White Swan but hes not so sure she can embody the dark side of the Swan Queen. So he imports from the West Coast another dancer Lily (Mila Kunis) whose cunning deviousness and rampant Id make her an ideal Black Swan. Lily becomes Ninas alternate for the Swan Queen -- and her rival. Nina got the role in the first place when Thomas cavalierly tossed aside the companys previous prima ballerina Beth (Winona Ryder). Beth slinks around the films periphery hissing obscenities and accusations until she winds up in a hospital after walking in front of a car. Like the mother character Beth exists to up the ante of paranoia and tension as mental chaos relentlessly assails Nina. Ninas drive for perfection runs roughshod over her health and friendships. Nothing else matters. Thomas eggs her on using sexual abuse and intimidation to get her to ""lose yourself"" in darkness. If he only knew how truly lost Nina is in that darkness. What she really is losing is her sense of reality. All this psycho drama builds to a fever pitch braced by the woozy lyricism of Tchaikovskys music sumptuous choreography by New York City Ballet star Benjamin Millepied and Matthew Libatiques darting weaving camera. By ""Swan Lakes"" opening night the film surrenders to the surreal when Ninas body grows feathers and horrific backstage mayhem vanishes on cue. Aronofsky working with an original script by Andres Heinz that later was rewritten by Mark Heyman and John McLaughlin never succeeds in wedding genre elements to the world of ballet. The film takes its cues from ""Swan Lake"" itself as demons doubles and death dance in Ninas head. She can only approach perfection by becoming the dual character she plays -- the innocent and the evil. Portman who has danced but is no ballerina does a more than credible job in the big dance numbers and the tough rehearsals that are so essential to the film. In her acting too you sense she has bravely ventured out of her comfort zone to play a character slowly losing sight of herself. Its a bravura performance. Kunis makes a perfect alternate to Portman equally as lithe and dark but a smirk of self-assurance in place of Portmans wide-eyed fearfulness. Indeed White Swan/Black Swan dynamics almost work but the horror-movie nonsense drags everything down the rabbit hole of preposterousness.

A wicked sexy and ultimately devastating study of a young dancers all-consuming ambition ""Black Swan"" serves as a fascinating complement to Darren Aronofskys ""The Wrestler"" trading the grungy world of a broken-down fighter for the more upscale but no less brutal sphere of professional ballet. Centerstage stands Natalie Portman whose courageous turn lays bare the myriad insecurities genuinely dedicated performers face when testing their limits revealing shades of the actress never before seen on film. As with ""The Wrestler"" Fox Searchlight faces formidable marketing challenges likely exploiting the psychosexual thrillers racier elements to eke out a similarly modest score. Once again Aronofsky is drawn to the irresistible force that drives certain personality types to chase the spotlight except in this case the impulse doesnt seem born of some deep-seated egotism but is simply programmed from childhood by a controlling mother (a creepy but far from one-note Barbara Hershey). Portman plays Nina a virginal young ballerina who comes across as an incomplete soul her single-minded interest in dance eclipsing all other aspects of her being. In the films staggering opening sequence (arresting enough to give skeptical male auds reason to stick around) Nina dreams of herself in ""Swan Lakes"" lead role circled by dark forces. But in order to land the Swan Queen part in Lincoln Centers upcoming season of reimagined classics Nina must also master the shows seductive Black Swan. The svengali-like figure responsible for her corruption is French ballet maestro Thomas Leroy (played with smoldering physicality by Vincent Cassel) a director already ensnared with his previous star Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder in a crucial but barely-there part). Brief glimpses of Beth on her way out remind how quickly young replacements are cast aside in the cruel world of ballet though Nina is no Eve Harrington. Whats missing from Portmans characterization --  and the film itself --  is the pressing need to perform the inescapable artistic contagion that powered Powell and Pressburgers ""The Red Shoes"" (""Black Swan"" sorely lacks that films romantic dimension as well). Instead Portmans naive young dancer is driven by a need for perfection at all costs a variation on the impossible obsession that destroyed the protagonist in Aronofskys ""Pi."" From the beginning Thomas remarks on Ninas ability to nail the technical requirements of the role while questioning whether she can loosen up enough to capture what the Black Swan demands. Ironically the metamorphosis is well within Portmans grasp as a performer (as is the ballet which the actress studied intensively for 10 months prior to shooting) while the effort to embody the frigid young ingenue seems to pose the greater challenge. Aronofsky and costume designer Amy Westcott are none too subtle with the films symbolism dressing Nina in innocent white outfits while those around her wear darker and considerably more ominous colors. These exaggerated stylistic choices (somewhat at odds with Aronofskys documentary-like sense of detail and Matthew Libatiques handheld shooting style) extend to the production design as well adding yet another motif Reflective surfaces mostly mirrors offer fleeting glimpses of Ninas other half. Coupled with Clint Mansells score which expands upon Tchaikovskys original ""Swan Lake"" compositions to suggest something considerably more macabre (further aided by proper horror-movie sound design) the result is an unsettling yet ultimately intuitive blend of classical and contempo techniques. While Thomas tries to draw Nina out and her suffocating stage mother attempts to freeze the growing rift in her daughters personality the individual who reveals Nina most is Lily (Mila Kunis) a new addition to the ballet company who serves as her dark double. Lily is spontaneous seductive and experienced in a way Nina is not making the latter fiercely jealous of what comes so naturally to her rival --  a problem that can only be overcome by breaking down certain boundaries between them. Already the film has acquired a certain lesbian allure courtesy of a trailer that somewhat unfairly teases a scandalous Portman-Kunis love scene. This footage will no doubt help to entice ballet-averse auds though ""Black Swan"" is anything but a Brian De Palma-style erotic escapade (superficial echoes of ""Sisters"" and ""Femme Fatale"" notwithstanding). Aronofsky seems to be operating more in the vein of early Roman Polanski or David Cronenberg at his most operatic. Though the director never immerses us as deeply inside Portmans head as he did Mickey Rourkes in ""The Wrestler"" the latter third of ""Black Swan"" depicts a highly subjective view of events that calls to mind the psychological disintegration of both ""Repulsion"" and ""Rosemarys Baby."" At first Ninas hysteria seems innocuous enough exaggerating minor injuries (a split toenail or irritated shoulder rash) into squirm-inducing conditions or having her project a dark version of herself onto strangers glimpsed in the subway or on the street. But as the pressure intensifies Ninas hallucinations begin to take over to the extent that nearly everything can be read as manifestations of her subconscious --  the spiritual cost of trespassing beyond her comfort zone for the sake of a role.
