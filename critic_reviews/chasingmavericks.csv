A seamless blend of open-water photography visual effects and sound design effectively replicates the massive power of the titles world-famous surf break. But floating atop the explosive breakers like an overabundance of phytoplankton is a roiling colony of cliches that stops at nothing to dominate the screenplay. Every time a character opens his or her mouth out comes a red tide torrent of gimmicky aphorisms phony wisdom and convenient wisecracks with all the conviction of dialogue from an 80s-era TV movie of the week. Based on a true story Jay Moriarity picks up surfing out of sheer will as a nine-year-old. Several years later the Santa Cruz native persuades his mentor Frosty Hesson to train him to surf one of the biggest and toughest breaks in the world. Gerard Butler evinces a noble charisma as Frosty with the charm and underlying vulnerability that a young Harrison Ford might have brought to the role. As Moriarity Jonny Weston practically glimmers with infectious good spirits and optimism. Yet the film focuses almost exclusively on the teenage Moriaritys soul-surfer perseverance and movies about happiness and cheer are hard to pull off. Directors Curtis Hanson and Michael Apted (the latter took over when Hanson became ill during principal photography) dont make clear what we should care about in this near-hagiography. Invigorating surfing imagery aside its no match for the documentaries of Bruce Brown and Stacey Peralta as a nuanced portrait of the surfing life.

Johnson/Twentieth Century Fox Chasing Mavericks is the real-life story of Jay Moriarty (Jonny Weston) a surfing prodigy from Santa Cruz who made waves (ahem) in 1994 when at the age of 16 he seemingly came out of nowhere to surf the legendary Mavericks a particularly dangerous Northern Pacific break known for massive crests of up to 80 feet. The film informs us that Moriarty didnt actually appear out of thin air Instead he was coached with Mr. Miyagi-like steeliness by ""Frosty"" Hesson (Gerard Butler) a gruff demanding older surfer and neighbor who taught the boy all about stamina observation and mental discipline. In turn Jay taught the embittered disillusioned Frosty about perseverance and family. Its a perfect fortune cookie of a movie full of bland life lessons for everybody; would that there were some drama or style in it somewhere along the way. Amazingly the stiff barely functional direction here comes courtesy of Curtis Hanson (L.A Confidential Wonder Boys) and Michael Apted (Thunderheart Coal Miners Daughter) two veteran Oscar-nominated filmmakers who regularly do fine work. But they thrive in the realm of the literal Both directors tend to be good with dialogue and sharply drawn characters and what Chasing Mavericks needs and lacks is poetry. ""We all come from the sea. But we are not of the sea. Those of us who are we children of the tides must return to it again and again"" Butlers voice-over intones at the beginning suggesting that were about to get a film about the relentless haunting fascination of the sea -- the way its mystery can intrude on our little lives. What we get instead are mostly characters going through telegraphed journeys. Even so there are occasional glimpses here of the film that might have been. Early on Frosty stands outside his home at night and seeing his wife dealing with their newborn walks away and avoids them; meanwhile Jay comes home to find that his dad has left and his mom is lying in bed a bottle by her side. (Mom is played by Elisabeth Shue who is wasted by this film in more ways than one.) The building blocks are generic but the juxtaposition of them clever The older man fears responsibility and a stable family life while the young boy wishes he could have one. They will eventually become we realize father figures for one another. But the script (by Kario Salem) doesnt quite follow through on that setup relying instead on boilerplate plot points. Jay lives through his side of a half-baked love triangle deals with the usual bullies and tut-tuts at his best friends drug habit. At the very least you would think that the film would find a way to contrast the petty agony of this life with the elemental wonder of the waves. After all the sea has always had a pull on certain filmmakers imaginations Luc Bessons free-diving epic The Big Blue gave its characters deadly obsession with the deep a sensuous seductive quality while John Miliuss Big Wednesday turned surfing into a search for a Zen constant in a world gone haywire. Meanwhile Kathryn Bigelows Point Break and John Stockwells Blue Crush used the freewheeling amped-up energy of the surfing subculture to fuel their respective story lines. But Chasing Mavericks rarely integrates its mundane reality with transcendental awe. The imagery by veteran cinematographer Bill Pope is often picturesque but rarely suspenseful (though we do get some terrific stunts during a climactic wave-riding sequence). The acting doesnt help much either. Butler is good at glaring but when he speaks he sounds like a caricature of a grizzled hard-ass. And with his all-American blandness Weston (who looks like the secret love child of Kirk Cameron and The Blue Lagoons Christopher Atkins) has the opposite problem Hes earnest but stiff. With all due respect to the memory of the real Jay Moriarty (who died tragically at the age of 21) this films version of him could just as easily be a promising basketball player or a spelling-bee champ. Hes merely an off-the-rack movie teen with a big prefab dream.

"Chasing Mavericks | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; chasing-mavericks ) Chasing Mavericks (United States 2012) October 26 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli Chasing Mavericks feels like two completely different movies that have been mashed together. The first a derivative and unsatisfying coming-of-age story about a Santa Cruz boy and his adopted father figure seems uncharacteristically weak for the likes of co-directors Curtis Hanson and Michael Apted. The second a rousing documentary about surfing maverick waves is awe-inspiring and almost worth the price of admission. The problem is to get to the surfing footage its necessary to navigate the undertow of bad acting laughable dialogue and predictable narrative. The story has also been whitewashed to make it appropriate for family audiences. Teenagers in the world of Chasing Mavericks lack hormones. Chasing Mavericks is ""based on a true story"" which in this case means some of what we see on screen kind-of sort-of happened during the late 1980s and early 1990s. The lead character Jay Moriarty (Jonny Weston) was a real person who rose to prominence in the surfing world when he was in mid mid-teens. (He subsequently died at age 22 in a free-diving accident.) Chasing Mavericks purports to tell of his interest in surfing mavericks and how with the aid of his Mr. Miyagi-inspired mentor Frosty Hesson (Gerard Butler) he achieved that goal. The story which has been manipulated in a way that would make Disney blush gives us a best friend (Blond played by Devin Crittenden) an alcoholic mother (Kristy played by Elisabeth Shue) a girlfriend (Kim played by Leven Rambin) and a rival (Sonny played by Taylor Handley). The elements are all in place for the movie to travel the formulaic path to the grand finale. One cant help but wish the filmmakers had opted to spend a lot more time in the water because when its on land Chasing Mavericks is all wet. Originally this was not intended to be a collaborative effort but when Curtis Hanson (L.A. Confidential 8 Mile) fell ill midway through the shoot a substitute was needed. Michael Apted stepped into the breach; despite being best known for his long-running Up documentary series Apted is no stranger to feature films having once helmed a Bond movie (The World is not Enough) and more recently the Narnia entry The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. Perhaps the change in director is an explanation for why Chasing Mavericks is so distressingly generic but its probably more the fault of Kario Salems screenplay which tosses too many thinly-developed characters and subplots at the viewer in the vague hope that something will stick. The lead character is played by relative newcomer Jonny Weston who was apparently selected because of his physical resemblance to the real Jay Moriarty. The producers have also stated they wanted someone not immediately recognizable. Westons physicality is without question and his acting ability is adequate. The films biggest ""name"" actor Gerard Butler is miscast but that could be because we have become so used to him playing tough guys that its hard to accept him in the role of an overage surfer dude. Keanu Reeves might have been a better choice. Chasing Mavericks other recognizable face Elisabeth Shue is shoehorned into the obligatory ""absent mom"" role. Shes an alcoholic loser who is in a reverse-relationship with Jay he fills the ""parent"" role and shes the ""child."" This could have been an interesting dynamic if it wasnt presented in such a perfunctory manner. That comment is largely true of every interpersonal relationship with the exception of the one between Frosty and Jay which forms the films emotional backbone. In the admittedly small subgenre of surfing movies recognition starts (and perhaps ends) with Point Break. Although not a titan of drama or adventure that movie spins a more compelling tale than the one on offering in Chasing Mavericks but the surfing sequences are more impressive here. Credit goes to everyone involved - the scenes with characters challenging the maverick waves are amazing. I have no idea how much of a mix of trick camera work stunt surfers and CGI was employed but the illusion is effective. For Hanson and Apted this is a rather inconsequential effort. Its themes of perseverance and facing ones inner fear will likely win it some adherents even though those are developed in ways that are more straightforward and less compelling than one might expect. The reason to see Chasing Mavericks is the same reason why people flock to shore locations when a hurricane approaches the waves. This is less effective as a bio-pic of Jay Moriarty than it is as a big screen National Geographic Special.

Chasing Mavericks review Be the board | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesChasing Mavericks review Be the boardChasing Mavericks starring Gerard Butler and Jonny Weston is based on the real story of California surfing legend Jay Moriarity.Gerard Butler and Jonny Weston in Chasing Mavericks a movie of epic waves but shallow narrative.  (John P. Johnson / Twentieth Century Fox)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterFri. Oct. 26 2012Chasing Mavericks(out of 4)Starring Gerard Butler Jonny Weston Elisabeth Shue and Leven Rambin. Directed by Curtis Hanson and Michael Apted. 115 minutes. Opens Oct. 26 at major theatres. PGThe heart-pounding surfing scenes are epic but the script can barely keep its head above the waves in the dramatized biopic Chasing Mavericks.The family drama is based on the true story of California teen surfing legend Jay Moriarity (played with pleasing boyish charm by newcomer Jonny Weston) who yearned to take on the mythic and massive wave break dubbed Mavericks by the surfers brave enough to take it on.Article Continued BelowFrosty Hesson (Gerard Butler trading in 300 heroics for a buddy-coach role) Jays neighbour in a rundown beachside suburb is one of them. He reluctantly agrees to train the determined Jay after the kid sneaks along for a look at Frosty and his pals (played by pro surfers Peter Mel Zach Wormhoudt and Greg Long) going up against the 10-metre monsters.Orphaned as a kid we never learn how Frosty a contractor who would rather be surfing than installing kitchens got his nickname. Could it be his icy demeanour when battling the surf or his chilled emotions? His wife Brenda (Abigail Spencer) a kitchen-sink psychologist would certainly say its the latter.So Frosty sees something of himself in Jay. The earnest teen is the man of the house since his dad walked out on his fragile mom (Elisabeth Shue poorly used here) a woman who has more than a whiff of white trash about her.Frosty trains Jay for Mavericks monstrous waves bad boys so big some dismiss them as fantasy. He makes Jay take on all manner of Karate Kid-like challenges from feats of strength to essays. Its all a bit too after-school special what with the bad kid who uses drugs the pressures on Jay to work extra shifts at the pizza parlour to pay the bills and the pretty miss (Leven Rambin) who cant see Jay is desperately pining for her.With dialogue that sounds taken from fortune cookie messages and motivational posters Chasing Mavericks sticks to its mission of inspiration and dedication as Jay and Frosty the surfman forge a father-son-like bond we can see coming from the first frame.Directed by Curtis Hanson (8 Mile Wonder Boys and an Oscar winner for L.A. Confidential) who had to drop out due to health problems and finished by Michael Apted (Coal Miners Daughter The World is Not Enough) Chasing Mavericks could have used some more judicious editing to trim the overlong 115-minute runtime.What makes it worthy of a big-screen ticket is the amazing camerawork of Bill Pope (the Matrix series) who gives a boards-eye view of the terrifying magnificence of the furious ocean instilling respect for anybody brave -- or foolish -- enough to take it on.

Michael Posner The Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 26 2012 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Oct. 25 2012 431PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Michael Apted Curtis Hanson Written by Kario Salem Jim Meenaghan Brandon Hooper Starring Gerard Butler Jonny Weston Elizabeth Shue Classification PG Genre drama Year 2012 Country USA Language English I dont know if you have to be a surfer to fully appreciate Chasing Mavericks but it certainly wouldnt hurt. When every frayed plot device youve predicted makes its inevitable appearance at least youll have the majestic waves off the California coastline to comfort you.Ostensibly the double-helmed feature - director Curtis Hanson became ill near the end of the shoot and was replaced by Michael Apted - is based on the life of the late surfing legend Jay Moriarity (Jonny Weston) who drowned in a diving accident at the age of 22. Screen grab from AP video Video Gerard Butler talks surfing accident at premiere Ever-smiling nicer-than-nice Jay carries a lot on his adolescent plate an absent father an irresponsible semi-alcoholic mother (Elisabeth Shue) a part-time job in a pizza parlour a gang of menacing drug-dealing toughs (who never deliver on their threats) an unrequited love for Kim (Leven Rambin) and his burning quest to conquer the mavericks the surfing term used to describe the outsized rogue breaks common to the Half Moon Bay region near Santa Cruz.To that end Jay enlists the reluctant help of his neighbour the aptly named Frosty (Gerard Butler). A married roofer with two children Frosty is an unreconstructed surfer at heart and soon becomes Jays surrogate father escorting him on early-morning paddles and prepping him mentally and physically for the mavericks challenge.Of course there is a narrow window of time during which to make the teenager maverick-worthy - the super-waves roll in only a few months of the year. And life as it does keeps getting in the way of the best-laid training regimens.If you think you have seen this story arc before you probably have. Its The Karate Kid with Butler as the rubber-suited sensei who must force his young charge to dig ever deeper. The enemy is not the killer wave. You have to control your own fear.Westons Jay is so relentlessly wholesome that you could put his face on orange juice. (A veteran surfer he apparently did most of his own stunts.) Irishman Butler still struggling to find a plausible American accent dutifully follows the plots trajectory from reflexive gruff to loving in loco parentis. Every one else does exactly what cardboard props are designed to do.Surfer documentaries do a better job of capturing the incredible athleticism of the sport but as features go Mavericks is a cut above if only for its fidelity to the ethos. The script alas is what it is so just ignore it and focus on the cinematography of Oliver Euclid and Bill Pope - the mighty Pacific throwing its weight around and toying with our petty ambitions.

I try to avoid spoilers in reviews but its only fair to warn parents that the supposedly inspirational family-friendly fact-based and often sappy ""Chasing Mavericks ends with the main characters memorial service. A title card informs us that surfing legend Jay Moriarty drowned while diving (alone) at the age of 22 and in the film we see him repeatedly engaging in potentially lethal surfing off the California coast before his 16th birthday. Were eventually told Jays boozy single mom (Elisabeth Shue) is aware that hes had his girlfriend forge the mothers signature to a ""permission slip but still you might not want the kids trying this at home. Jays chief enabler is his neighbor surrogate dad and daredevil surfer Frosty Hesson played by Scottish actor Gerard Butler with an amusing American accent that makes him sound like he gargled with scotch before each take. Its 1994 and Frosty discovers that teenage Jay (played at this point by Jonny Weston whose best acting is done in the water) has stowed away atop his truck to watch Frosty and his pals surf massive waves in a secret spot called Mavericks. Frostys wife (Abigail Spencer) convinces her husband its his obligation to teach Jay how to survive these waves because if he doesnt Jay will just try to do this himself with tragic results. Thus Frosty becomes Jays Mr. Miyagi lecturing his young charge about his philosophy of surfing while they spend so many hours in the water together that you wonder why someone doesnt call childrens services. Why two stars? The surfing sequences are some of the best Ive ever seen in a film and the re-creation of Jays climactic battle to ride El Nino-driven waves is real white-knuckle stuff. But neither Curtis Hanson (""L.A. Confidential"") nor the fellow veteran director who replaced him when Hanson took ill Michael Apted (""Gorillas in the Mist) can do much with the hokey sequences on land. Jay works in a pizzeria to help support his mom falls in love with a beautiful girl he will later (briefly) marry helps a pal who is tempted by drugs and is taunted by a wealthy bully straight out of ""The Karate Kid. At least the makers of that film were able to provide a happy ending -- unlike that of ""Chasing Mavericks.

Starring Gerard Butler Elisabeth Shue Leven Rambin Abigail Spencer Taylor Handley Jonny Weston Alexander Kanellakos Director Curtis Hanson Running time 145 Release Opened Oct 26 2012  Editorial Review Riding a wave of inspirationBy Michael OSullivanFriday October 26 2012There are two monster waves in ""Chasing Mavericks"" a surfing movie inspired by the life of Jay Moriarity the Northern California teenager who in 1994 became an overnight celebrity in the surfing world after riding the infamous swells off Half Moon Bay known as Mavericks. One is the literal mass of churning white water -- more washing machine than wave due to the bays unusual reef formation -- that lends the movie its name and much of its dramatic power. The other is a more figurative hydraulic -- the tsunami of schmaltzy melodrama that at times threatens to swamp the proceedings which at heart are actually kind of thrilling and inspirational. Although ""Mavericks"" is structured around the quasi father-son relationship between the squeaky-clean Jay (Jonny Weston) and Frosty Hesson (Gerard Butler) the gruff grizzled surfing veteran who becomes the teens life coach and big-wave trainer theres lots of extraneous plotting -- which however fact based is handled in such a pre-fab manner that it feels phony. Jay comes from a broken home and has abandonment issues around his absentee father. Jays mother (a fine Elizabeth Shue) is an irresponsible drunk at least initially. Jays childhood best friend (Devin Crittenden) starts hanging out with disreputable types threatening their friendship. Theres also a seemingly unattainable childhood sweetheart (Leven Rambin) and years of unrequited puppy love. Frosty for his part is wrestling with balancing family life as a husband and father of two kids with his love of a dangerous sport. Thats a lot for one little movie. Fortunately directors Michael Apted (best known for the series of ""Up"" documentaries) and Curtis Hanson (""L.A. Confidential"") manage to keep this syrupy tide in check mostly by focusing on the central relationship between Frosty who learns how to be a better father from his protege and Jay who finds a surrogate dad in his mentor. After a somewhat shaky start the movie improves as it works its way out of the tangle of subplots to an undeniably stirring conclusion. It even manages to make its corny surfing-as-a-metaphor-for-life message somewhat palatable although its not much deeper than ""carpe diem."" As Frosty Butler is appealingly crusty. His character is a nice -- and necessary -- tonic to Westons Jay who seems to have stepped out of a 1960s Disney movie. With his blond ringlets buff bod and sunny demeanor Jay is a male Pollyanna as loath to utter an unkind word as he is easy on the eyes. The surf cinematography is pretty impressive too. ""Chasing Mavericks"" builds perhaps not exactly like the majestic 40-foot walls of water that are its subject but with a satisfying enough -- and even somewhat unexpected -- crash. Like any wave it will carry you away as long as you dont try to fight it. Contains some roughhousing and dangerous surf.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 1054 a.m. EDT October 26 2012Majestic five-story waves are the stars in a film that should have better served the life of surf legend Jay Moriarity.Gerard Butler left and Jonny Weston star in Chasing Mavericks a surf movie that catches big waves and inspirational sports cliches. (Photo John P. Johnson Twentieth Century Fox)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY review   stars out of four; rated PG; opens Friday nationwideStars Gerard Butler Jonny Weston Elisabeth ShueFilm is based on true story of surfing legend Jay MoriarityNo this is not a movie about pursuing Sarah Palin.Chasing Mavericks is about surfin USA -- specifically some of the biggest breakers on the continent. Mavericks is the name of a huge surf break near Santa Cruz Calif. reaching up to 25 to 35 feet in peak times. Those waves are the uncontested stars of the movie.The film is based on the true story of surfing legend Jay Moriarity (Jonny Weston) and his friendship with Frosty Hesson (Gerard Butler in a bushy blond hairdo). Nothing about Chasing Mavericks (  stars out of four; rated PG; opens Friday nationwide) deviates much from the inspirational sports playbook.Frosty is Jays guardian angel in a wetsuit saving 8-year-old Jays life when the boy falls into roiling waves. The film skips ahead seven years to Jay as a surfing teen and all-around good kid whose risk-taking proclivities on surfboards and skateboards dont translate to other areas of his life. He dutifully takes care of his single mom (Elisabeth Shue) making sure her work uniforms are clean and that shes up and ready for work on time. Shue almost literally sleeps through her part. Her character spends half of her screen time passed out in bed presumably exhausted from work drunk or depressed.MANDELL Gerard Butler a true Hollywood maverickUnnecessary moments of silly conflict are thrown in for no good reason in the form of some local thugs who refer to Jay as ""trash"" and uselessly taunt him. Theres enough real conflict in Jays life with an absentee dad and a tuned-out single mom who loses a succession of jobs. Why muck up a good story with forced small-time obstacles?Everything centers on Jays passionate desire to surf the Mavericks surf break dubbed the Loch Ness Monster of surfing by Frosty for its near-mythic status. But not only are these waves frighteningly real theyre only a few miles from Jays Santa Cruz home.When Jay asks Frosty for help training to take on Mavericks the older surfer initially dismisses him. Cue Frostys ever-supportive wife Brenda (Abigail Spencer) painted as wise as the Oracle at Delphi. ""You just dont get it do you"" Brenda gently chides explaining to Frosty that fathers come in all guises. And since Jays dad is AWOL Frosty has a chance to partially fill that role.Unfortunately Chasing Mavericks spends too much time feeling like a watery Karate Kid. In the vein of Pat Moritas ""Wax on wax off"" Frosty offers homespun advice that is not surprisingly weightier than it appears. He doles out chores that Jay completes without complaining. He even assigns Jay a couple of essays though Frosty hardly seems like the professorial type. We do however get a sense of Jays unflagging drive.None of this rings particularly true. Or at the very least it feels embellished for the big screen. No doubt Frosty and Jay had a special friendship and the older surfer must have offered Jay some useful surfing pointers. But the scenes of assignments platitudes and exercises grow tedious. When the film heads out to the churning sea things get more interesting.Ultimately the story of Jay Moriarity who died tragically in a diving accident at 22 is a moving one and he deserved a better tribute than this film directed by Curtis Hanson and Michael Apted. With the massive power and mesmerizing curl of the giant waves Chasing Mavericks is at its best offshore.Read or Share this story http//usat.ly/TDwzmA",http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~r/UsatodaycomMovies-TopStories/~3/FHRyo-36EG0/,200,chasingmavericks8,chasingmavericks,usatoday

Johnson Associated Press Chasing Mavericks review For surfing fans 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Chasing Mavericks Drama. Starring Jonny Weston and Gerard Butler. Directed by Curtis Hanson and Michael Apted. (PG. 111 minutes.) ""Chasing Mavericks"" breaks through the cliches associated with surfer movies - the carefree beach party fantasies the fake mysticism - and offers a portrait that has a lot more integrity. In this telling the really serious surfers the big wave guys are anything but happy-go-lucky airheads. They are athletes who study currents and wave patterns and train their minds as well as their bodies knowing that theyre doing something almost crazy that has a good chance of killing them. So at the very least audiences will come away from ""Chasing Mavericks"" with a deeper understanding of surfing and an appreciation for surfers. Love has a way of demanding respect and the more irrational and dangerous the love is the more interesting. Yet for all that and despite the collaboration of two estimable directors - Michael Apted (the ""Up"" series) and Curtis Hanson (""L.A. Confidential"") - ""Chasing Mavericks"" moves as fast as a runner in waist-high water and wears out its welcome. The film is the true story of Jay Moriarity (Jonny Weston) a teenager from Santa Cruz who become famous overnight for surviving one of the worst wipe-outs in history. While surfing a wave the size of an apartment building he fell straight down and was held underwater by the current. Moriarity went on to have a legendary surfing career. ""Chasing Mavericks"" tells of Moriaritys discovery of surfing as a child and his training as a teenager in Santa Cruz to surf the waves at Mavericks. The training is systematic and guided by an older surfer Frosty (Gerard Butler) with whom he forms a father-son bond. In one way the training is too rigorous The story gets locked in the training phase and stays there until the viewer is more tired than Moriarity. Weston has a lovable guileless quality reminiscent of the real Moriarity who is shown at the end of the picture and the surfing scenes are well shot and interesting until they cease to be interesting. There is a pretty good 90-minute movie trapped inside this 111-minute extravaganza. As it stands this one is mainly for surfing aficionados. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

The outstanding big-wave footage proves more credible than the overfamiliar dramatics in ""Chasing Mavericks"" an earnest account of how Jay Moriarity became a Northern California teen surfing legend before his diving-accident death at age 22. Clunky and touching by turns this conventional effort from directors Curtis Hanson and Michael Apted centers around the relationship between the intrepid youth and his tough-love mentor both of whom embrace the ocean as a means of escaping and eventually conquering their deep personal heartaches. Overlong result wont benefit from Foxs low-profile marketing push which should generate mid-range B.O. ripples. Moriarity achieved fame at 16 for tackling big waves at the legendary break known as Mavericks even surviving a massive 1994 wipeout that landed him on the cover of Surfer magazine. A 1987-set prologue shows 8-year-old Jay (Cooper Timberline) transfixed by the tides breaking off the coast of his native Santa Cruz; seven years later hes a young pro (now played by Jonny Weston) navigating the waves with a grace and ease his peers envy. Hes also a bit of a goody two-fins smiling relentlessly taking care of his stressed single mom (Elisabeth Shue) and drawing the ire of a local beach bully (Taylor Handley). But Jays intrepid streak comes to the fore when he spies older neighbor Rick ""Frosty"" Hesson (Gerard Butler) a more seasoned but similarly obsessive surfer riding huge waves at Mavericks. When Jay asks Frosty to initiate him into this dangerous sport the older man gruffly refuses at first but eventually agrees realizing the youth needs a paternal figure as well as a teacher. Thus begins an intense 12-week training regimen during which Jay learns to paddle with all his strength and hold his breath underwater for up to four minutes. In line with his sometimes odd ""Karate Kid""-style methods Frosty gives Jay essay assignments (occasioning much use of a mid-90s scene-setting typewriter) designed to sharpen his mind and help him confront his innermost fears. Based on a story by producers and surfing aficionados Jim Meenaghan and Brandon Hooper Kario Salems screenplay tends to spell out Jay and Frostys personal baggage with on-the-nose situations and dialogue much of it delivered by Frostys wife (a fine Abigail Spencer) who supports her hubby even when he would rather surf than make himself physically and emotionally available to his family. En route to its big climax timed to coincide with enormous El Nino-influenced Mavericks waves the story generates occasional swells of feeling as Jay enjoys an ongoing flirtation with popular girl Kim (Leven Rambin) and Frosty has to deal with an unexpected family crisis. But the core of this often meandering leisurely paced picture is the surrogate father-son bond anchored by Butler a dab hand at sensitive but emotionally clenched characters and somewhat less confidently by Weston an agreeable screen presence in a lead role conceived along blandly reverential lines. Both thesps were surfing novices at the start of shooting but look quite convincing on their longboards thanks to hours of arduous training (Butler himself barely survived a frightening mid-production accident that saw him dragged underwater by successive waves). With contributions by numerous Mavericks surfers including Brock Little (stunt coordinator) Grant Washburn (surf consultant) and Greg Long Peter Mel and Zach Wormhoudt (cast as Frostys fellow riders) verisimilitude appears to have been a top priority for all involved. In that respect the material and indeed the overall legacy of onscreen surfing benefit from having Hanson aboard. Reliably bringing intelligence and keen observation to each environment he tackles the helmer thoroughly depicts the combination of mental aptitude and physical endurance needed to survive this daredevil undertaking (Apted took the reins last year when Hanson left for health reasons). The eye-popping water footage looks digitally undoctored and entirely persuasive generally maintaining a certain long-shot distance that allows audiences to see the surfers bodies in motion thrillingly dwarfed by 40- and 50-foot waves. The films sense of fidelity extends to its portrait of Moriaritys beach community with lensing done in Santa Cruz and at Mavericks itself. Topnotch tech package is distinguished by Bill Popes clean lensing Ida Randoms production design and Sophie de Rakoffs costumes while Chad Fischers score and Andrea von Foersters 90s-centric soundtrack dramatically enhance the action.

If your inner amphibian craves a wave you have the right kind of brain to appreciate the elemental story and scenic backdrops. But advanced mammals might smell something fishy.Butler plays Frosty a grizzled surfer in Santa Cruz Calif. who inspires his young neighbor Jay Moriarty (Jonny Weston) to chase the legendary ""maverick"" waves that tower up to 50 feet over a secluded rocky cove. Jay is only 15 and his single mom (Elisabeth Shue) is a mess so gruff-but-lovable Frosty becomes a surrogate parent to the wholesome kid while teaching him the zen of surfing.The 12 weeks of training before big-wave season includes tutorials on tides and currents that eco-minded audiences will enjoy and the free-for-all finale is both thrilling and spectacular. But ""Chasing Mavericks"" gets mired when its on dry land. It was co-directed by Curtis Hanson and Michael Apted who have made great films such as ""L.A. Confidential"" and the ""7 Up"" documentary series respectively. So its surprising that this movie is so lacking in personality. Granted both directors have been adrift for the past decade but even someone with water in his ears should have sensed that this script needed a rescue. Frostys pronouncements about conquering fear with the four pillars of surfer strength are wheezy and a subplot about Jays druggy best friend and a beach bully is dead weight. Even Jays crush on older classmate Kim (Leven Rambin) feels like little more than an obligatory inclusion in a true story.Finally the epilogue about living life to the fullest is dubious in light of the worry that surfing killer waves causes loved ones. While trying to be tubular ""Chasing Mavericks"" falls flat.

"Chasing Mavericks Surfs up films flat movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowMovie review In Chasing Mavericks surfs up films flatThe spectacular footage of the massive waves of Half Moon Bay ultimately prove far more involving than the overwrought story of true surfing legend Jay Moriarity.October 25 2012|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic The killer waves in ""Chasing Mavericks"" are the thing to watch the only thing to watch. They are angry waves monsters a with lots of attitude and undertow. If only the rest of the film had followed in their wake. The story and even the surfing just dont hold water against their crushing presence or fierce beauty.Starring Gerard Butler newcomer Jonny Weston and other beachy types ""Chasing Mavericks"" is based on the true story of surfing wunderkind Jay Moriarity (Weston). He lived a short but meaningful life making his name by surfing and surviving the infamous Mavericks surf break at Californias Half Moon Bay. Success came early at 16 and death as well a a free-diving accident off the Maldives when he was about to turn 23. By that point Moriarity had become a major figure in the surfing world known as much for his winning smile as his exceptional athleticism.The story by Jim Meenaghan and Brandon Hooper molded into a screenplay by Kario Salem focuses on Moriaritys early obsession with the sport his preparation to take on the big waves and his first-time try at the Mavericks. Even though it was a wipeout the moment gave the teenager an impressive start. Caught by photographers and splashed across surfing publications everywhere he became an overnight sensation.The film which started under the direction of Curtis Hanson with Michael Apted stepping in when Hanson became ill suffers from a serious unevenness from the first frame to the last. In fact ""Mavericks"" is so far from either directors best work a Hansons ""L.A. Confidential"" or ""The River Wild"" Apteds ""Coal Miners Daughter"" or ""Gorillas in the Mist"" a its hard to find their imprint at all.The footage itself particularly of the surf is spectacular with veteran cinematographer Bill Pope handling the camerawork. But the drama is soggy overreaching for the heartfelt and overdoing the inspirational. The ""Live Like Jay"" mantra which honors Moriaritys indomitable spirit never rings with the kind of emotional truth it actually carries in the world of competitive surfing and around his hometown of Santa Cruz.As ""Chasing Mavericks"" chronicles by all accounts Moriarity was a decent kid with a difficult start. After his dad left his mom played by Elisabeth Shue spent most of her time drunk and depressed a at least in the films telling. As a teenager Jay found a sense of purpose in riding the big waves and a surrogate father figure in an irascible older surfing dude named Frosty (Butler). For some human conflict there is a local tough (Taylor Handley) whos been specializing in bullying him since grade school. And on the romantic front there is Kim (Leven Rambin) the girl he got a crush on at 9 and would eventually marry.Weston definitely looks the part of young surfer dude on the rise a blond and bronzed with startling blue eyes. Though he is better in his scenes with Rambin the first-time actor struggles particularly opposite the dominating presence of Butler. Meanwhile Shue a fine actress who more than proved in ""Leaving Las Vegas"" that she knows how to finesse a drunk scene is seriously wasted here (as in ill-used). Most of her time is spent passed out on the bed with Jay left to make the dinners wash the clothes and wake her up when she oversleeps which is all the time.As for Butler ""Chasing Mavericks"" seems to continue the trend of roles that have the actor saving whatever world he happens into. His best performances thus far are rooted in ancient times a leading the Spartans into that doomed battle in 2006s ""300"" running the resistance in Ralph Fiennes update of Shakespeares ""Coriolanus"" in 2011. The rest of the lot including last years ""Machine Gun Preacher"" havent been a good fit despite or perhaps because of all their do-gooding intentions. ""Chasing Mavericks"" falls into the ""Machine Gun"" category of disappointments a at best its a wash.betsy.sharkeylatimes.comChasing MavericksMPAA rating PG for thematic elements and some perilous actionRunning time 1 hour 55 minutesPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Hollywood back lot moments The Envelope Awards Insider PHOTOS NC-17 movies Ratings explained MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESGerard Butlers surfing mentor?

(John P. Johnson) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday October 25 2012 452 PM Title Chasing Mavericks Film Info With Gerard Butler Jonny Weston. Biopic about a young surfer and his mentor. Directors Michael Apted Curtis Hanson (145). PG Mature themes peril. Area theaters. The sinking feeling starts as soon as ""Chasing Mavericks"" opens with Gerard Butlers solemn narration ""We all come from the sea"" he intones ""but we are not all of the sea."" Profound dude. As it turns out the only truly interesting element about this cliched surfer flick is that it was made by celebrated directors Michael Apted (""Coal Miners Daughter"" the ""Seven Up"" documentary series) and Curtis Hanson (""L.A. Confidential"" ""8 Mile). How two talented and experienced filmmakers combined to create such an uninspired effort is a mystery that remains unsolved. Everything else in their formulaic biopic however is spelled out as obviously as possible. Butler plays true-life Santa Cruz surf legend Frosty Hesson who reluctantly agrees to teach his 15-year-old neighbor Jay Moriarity (Jonny Weston) everything he knows. Jays goal is to surf the near-mythical Mavericks wave though it intimidates even the most experienced pros. Screenwriter Kario Salem delivers an endless supply of obstacles without satisfactorily resolving any of them. Jays mom (Elisabeth Shue) is a drunken layabout; his dad disappeared years ago. His crush (Leven Rambin) is enigmatically distant; his best friend (Devin Crittenden) buys drugs from the local bully (Taylor Handley). And Frosty has his own issues which his adoring wife (Abigail Spencer) tries to repair by encouraging him to mentor Jay. If youre not sure how to respond to all this drama Chad Fischers score will guide you. Though the film is set primarily in 1994 Weston plays Jay like hes in a ""Gidget"" movie turning optimism into saintly naivete. The gruff Butler who can be overly abrasive in romantic comedies should provide some necessary edge. But he lacks the Zen shagginess that could have made Frosty more appealing. There is an interesting story in the life of Moriarity whose single-minded passion redefined his life. A documentary might have done him greater justice and its curious that Apted in particular didnt consider a non-fiction approach. As it is we too perpetually long for the ocean the only place where the movies clutter drops away.

So it goes with ""Chasing Mavericks"" a biopic that features not enough stirringly gorgeous surfing footage and way too many clunky biopic cliches in telling the story of surf legend Jay Moriarity. With a storyline as by-the-numbers as a square dance the movies one surprise comes with the closing credits -- namely that this trite ""inspirational"" movie is the product of two world-class filmmakers Curtis Hanson and Michael Apted. After a prologue in which eight-year-old Jay already obsessed with the big waves is rescued from drowning by his ten-hanging neighbor Frosty Hesson (Gerard Butler) we meet our lead character at age 15 and played by Jonny Weston. A talented young surfer Jay sneaks off one morning and watches Frosty tackle Mavericks a giant super-wave thought by many to be the stuff of legend. Once he sees Mavericks Jay has found his Mt. Everest and he wont rest until he can conquer it. He begs Frosty to train him and so begins a 12-week course that will include the physical (paddling from Santa Cruz to Monterey learning to go four minutes without breathing) and the mental (Jay writes essays for Frosty about observing the tides and conquering personal demons). Naturally the surf lessons become life lessons whether its about taking a step back and finding the easy way through a situation or distinguishing the difference between fear (a good thing) and panic (not so much). Kario Salems screenplay ticks off the character development in the most predictable way possible; when Jay reveals early on that he has an unopened latter from the father who abandoned him as a child we know that envelopes going to be torn open in the final act. Because of his positive attitude and many achievements at a relatively young age Jay Moriarity became a legend in the surf world. Unfortunately that mantle anchors the film -- rather than portray Jay as the complex and interesting person he no doubt was the movie reduces him to a paragon. Constantly upbeat and crowned in a halo of blond curls Weston has nothing to play that can make Jay anything but a blank shiny ideal. Butler may still be grappling with his American accent but at least Frosty has a flaw or two that give the actor something to do. The women in the film are handed even less to work with stuck playing The Girlfriend (Leven Rambin) or The Boozy Mom Who Suddenly Isnt Boozy Anymore (Elisabeth Shue). Abigail Spencer as Frostys wife gets some relatively complex moments but even she is saddled with the requisite ""Please dont go surf Mavericks tonight honey"" speech. None of the films many flaws matter when Jay or Frosty hops on a board and swims out to the waves. If the surfing scenes are real then theyre breathtaking; if theyre faked then theyve been faked brilliantly. But for that better to rent ""The Endless Summer"" or ""Step Into Liquid"" so you can cut right to the good stuff without having to wade through all the personal-growth and surrogate-family bushwa that ""Chasing Mavericks"" handles so badly.

"Movie review Chasing Mavericks - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate Chasing Mavericks is a by-the-numbers tribute Share Tweet Share Tweet By Wesley Morris Globe Staff | 10.25.12 | 409 PM Related Link Find showtimes and theaters Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Im guessing the draw for ""Chasing Mavericks"" is the surfing. Professionals are calling the water scenes the real thing. Its unclear where they stand on the rest of the movie. Hungering for competently photographed orchestrated and edited surfing shots is one thing. Most movies chop unevenly between real actors and their stunt doubles between handsome long shots and unconvincing close-ups. When ""Chasing Mavericks"" cuts away to a concerned or elated reaction its usually after a long shot of a real body on a board on a wave. But in order to arrive at a moment like that you have to put up with a family movie of aggravating blandness. You have to really believe in messianic innocence and by-the-numbers screenwriting. ""Chasing Mavericks"" is a fond tribute to the perseverance of the actual surfer Jay Moriarty who at 16 scaled a 50-foot wave -- a maverick -- off the coast of Santa Cruz Calif. and lived to retrieve his board and go right after another. Its a tribute rigged for cheers and tears. I mean I welled up at least once Theres a touching moment in which Jay whos played by Jonny Weston hugs his mother whos played as pure sunshine by Elisabeth Shue. Its Jays birthday and Mom turns out to have her act more together than I previously thought returning a few of the many favors hes done for her over the years (hes her alarm her cook and her ATM). But getting misty at a movie like this doesnt mean much. Its involuntary. When someone stomps on your foot you yell. Jay wants to ride a maverick and for education turns to a crusty ex-surfer named Frosty Hesson (Gerard Butler). The movie gives Jay a lovely blonde (Leven Rambin) to chase and a bully (Taylor Handley) to chase him. The chasing of the mavericks meanwhile will have to wait for Jay to do a lot of training not open an envelope from his father and negotiate his relationship with this blustery paternal surrogate. Who could want a movie this corny? Who could want it from Michael Apted and Curtis Hanson? Theyre sharing directing credit and what theyve come up with is curiously generic. You can find it by the can in the ""feel good"" aisle. The best aspects of Apted (patient observation) appear to have canceled the best of Hanson (rigorous storytelling). ""Chasing Mavericks"" feels like a lot of underdog sports movies -- ""Rocky"" ""The Karate Kid"" ""Rudy"" ""Million Dollar Baby."" But it doesnt work you up in any sustainable way. Moriarty died in a diving accident when he was 22 and the movie wants to consecrate him. Characters say things to Jay like ""You only see the good in things"" and ""Not everyone can be as perfect as you."" The only person whos comparatively perfect is Mrs. Frosty which you dont mind because Abigail Spencer pretty much plays the Loving Wife to radiant perfection. As the Mr. Miyagi in this scenario Butler is a dudely lug with great hair and a himbo residue. You know Frostys strength is a sham and that Jay will eventually have to be strong for him. Westons made fewer movies and isnt yet much of an actor -- he has the straw hair sparkling eyes and the dreamy amphibiousness of William Katt and Christopher Atkins -- but Weston gives the camera more than Butler usually does. These movies dont need great acting per se. You just need to respond to whoevers running up that hill the way you do with Ralph Macchio and Hilary Swank. To that end the films a kind of success. Come for the surfing. Stay for the sainthood. Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. Follow him on Twitter wesley_morris.

TWITTER Despite a generic inspirational template and a change of directors in the eleventh hour of filming the surfing pic manages to sufficiently overcome those obstacles with affecting results. Despite its many challenges including a generic inspirational sports movie template that piles on the cliches and a change of directors during the last few weeks of shooting Chasing Mavericks manages to sufficiently overcome those obstacles with admittedly affecting results. Credit some pulse-pounding surf footage and a dedicated cast headed by Gerard Butler and fresh-faced newcomer Jonny Weston for bringing home the true story of Santa Cruz boarding phenom Jay Moriarty and his mentor local legend Rick ""Frosty"" Hesson. PHOTOS Going for Gold 10 Medal-Worthy Olympics Movies While its release would appear to be keyed to the traditional Nov. 1 start of the Jay at Mavericks Big Wave memorial invitational its going to face an additional seemingly insurmountable challenge going up against the likes of Cloud Atlas and the Halloween-themed Fun Size on its opening weekend. The mentor/student and symbolic father/son relationship between Hesson and Moriarty initially captured the attention of director Curtis Hanson and subsequently Michael Apted who stepped in for an ailing Hanson late into the production. That bond between the 15-year-old Santa Cruz teen with a part-time job at a local pizzeria and his neighboring sun-wizened elder was formed over their mutual obsession over the Mavericks the near-mythic surf break responsible for some truly monster waves. Determined to personally tame the big wave despite the inherent dangers Moriarty readily agrees to Hessons strictly-regimented training program while also juggling school his job his fragile mother (an sympathetic Elisabeth Shue) and his pent-up feelings concerning an absentee father. VIDEO Chasing Mavericks Trailer Gerald Butler Surfs Legendary Waves Hesson on the other hand has a supportive wife (Abigail Spencer) and a young family also requiring his attention. Ironically considering all that raging water and pumping adrenalin its a disappointment to have their storys telling so dryly and listlessly executed. The script by Kario Salem (Don King Only in America The Rat Pack) adheres heavily to formulaic platitudes rather than allowing the energetic youthful milieu to dictate something with much more vitality. Fortunately a third-act plot development lends the well-meaning but bland proceedings the emotional investment needed and the cast capably takes it home. As no-nonsense Hesson Butler convincingly invests his character with a commanding presence and rugged physicality although its a shame the Scottish-born actors commitment to a credible consistent American accent wasnt as equally fierce. STORY Movie 43 Trailer Emma Stone Gerard Butler and a Plethora of Stars Get Raunchy Newcomer Weston meanwhile has a clean-scrubbed wide-eyed appeal as the determined young Moriarty who would ultimately drown the day before his 23rd birthday while diving in the Malidives. And while those gargantuan Santa Cruz waves have been impressively captured by cinematographer Bill Pope only at the films climax to they feel truly organic to the accompanying plotline rather than dropped in sporadically to inject the drab dramatics with some much-needed local color.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint CHASING MAVERICKS  OUT OF FOUR STARS Rated PG for thematic elements and some perilous action. In this sports biopic Gerard Butler plays Frosty Hesson gruff-but-tender mentor to surf prodigy Jay Moriarty (handsome newcomer Jonny Weston). The story is rather flimsy. Hesson no model father to his own kids blossoms as a stand-in dad and guru for the Santa Cruz longboard star coaching him from age 10 to 22 as the boy masters ever-gnarlier waves and personal challenges. The real drama in this film occurred offscreen when the original director ""L.A. Confidentials"" Curtis Hanson fell ill and was replaced by Michael Apted of ""The World Is Not Enough."" Both men share credit on a film that feels understandably generic. The surfing scenes with waves battering the Northern California coast are breathtaking while the side issues of stressed-out working-class parents teen love troubles and Nicholas Sparks-style life lessons are ho-hum. Nothing special; decent enough considering the circumstances. SIMON AND THE OAKS  OUT OF FOUR STARS Unrated war themes and sensuality. In subtitled Swedish and German. Theater Uptown. Talented acting family those Skarsgaards. Bill brother of Alex and son of Stellan impresses as the star of this sweeping World War II-era drama based on Marianne Fredrikssons Swedish bestseller. Simon Larsson is a bright dreamy solitary boy who feels out of place on his kind foster parents hardscrabble farm in the countryside outside Gothenburg. More interested in books and symphonies than log-splitting he cant wait to leave for the expensive private school his family can barely afford. There he comes to the aid of Isak a student whos being bullied by anti-Semitic classmates forming an instant friendship. Isak and his family are urban well-to-do and refined refugees from Berlin yet with them Simon finds a second family that embraces his own in friendship and business partnership. The film follows Simon and Isak through their teenage years into their first romances professional lives and shared destiny in Swedens postwar economic boom. Director Lisa Ohlins lush handsomely crafted middlebrow epic was nominated for 13 Swedish Oscars. KEEP THE LIGHTS ON  OUT OF FOUR STARS Unrated sex and drug use. In English and subtitled Danish. Theater Lagoon. We meet Erik (Thure Lindhardt) a young Danish documentarian living in millennial New York City as he works the phone trying to arrange an anonymous gay hookup. He meets and falls hard for Paul (Zachary Booth) a publishing junior executive who claims to have a girlfriend and tells Erik not to get his hopes up. Their intense sexual bond leads to dating and something like romance. Pauls girlfriend drops out of the picture and the men become a comfortably affluent sophisticated couple for a decade. Their relationship is still a love triangle however with Pauls clandestine addiction to crack rivaling his bond to self-doubting Erik. As their home life becomes a chain of unanswered calls home and unexplained absences both men must decide whether their relationship is worth fighting for. This intimate semi-autobiographical drama from director Ira Sachs (""Forty Shades of Blue"") is commendably frank about the challenges facing his characters. The cast uniformly excellent draws us into a vibrant energetic Manhattan where commitments are forged and broken through sheer chance and those seeking permanence must continually resist temptation and ennui.

Photo Credit Twentieth Century Fox advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A teenage surfer finds a grizzled mentor to help him tackle some of the biggest waves on earth. Based on the true story of Santa Cruz legend Jay Moriarity. BOTTOM LINE The late Moriarity was clearly an inspirational figure but this hagiography turns him into a flawless beacon of smiles and beatitude. Its all triumph no conflict. CAST Gerard Butler Jonny Weston Elisabeth Shue Leven Rambin LENGTH 145 Theres more to big-wave surfing than derring-do in ""Chasing Mavericks"" the story of a rising star Jay Moriarity (Jonny Weston) and his curmudgeonly guru Frosty Hesson (Gerard Butler). Frosty demands not only rigorous training but typewritten essays including one on the nature of fear. Jays first draft is rejected with two words ""Go deeper."" That would have been good advice for this shallow film. ""Chasing Mavericks"" is based on the real-life figures of Moriarity who died in a diving accident in 2001 (he was 22) and his father-figure Hesson but little about this movie feels true. Relentlessly inspirational and pointedly wholesome ""Chasing Mavericks"" invents minor conflicts but avoids major problems coming off less like a biographical drama than a visit from a guest lecturer during Sunday school.

Weston a relative newcomer has the curly locks and injection-molded physique of Christopher Atkins in ""The Blue Lagoon"" but Jay is scrubbed free of sexuality. Mostly hes excited about the enormous waves at Mavericks a secret surf spot near Santa Cruz. Determined to take one of those five-story vertical drops Jay convinces Frosty a flawed family man (Abigail Spencer plays his wife) to become his teacher. This setup requires Frosty to snarl and philosophize (""fear and panic are different emotions"") while Jay tries to stay focused despite his layabout mother (Elisabeth Shue) wayward friends and bullying townies. These turn out to be low hurdles although Jays childhood crush Kim (Leven Rambin) is harder to ignore. Even two skilled directors Curtis Hanson (""L.A. Confidential"") and Michael Apted (""Coal Miners Daughter"") cant do much with Kario Salems choppy unconvincing script. ""Chasing Mavericks"" consistently forgets that triumph doesnt mean much without something to triumph over. 225 VideoTrailer Chasing Mavericks PLOT A teenage surfer finds a grizzled mentor to help him tackle some of the biggest waves on earth.

Chasing Mavericks Year 2012 Director Michael Apted Curtis Hanson Studio Twentieth Century Fox Actors Gerard Butler Jonny Weston Elisabeth Shue Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture Those of us who love the surfing movie genre tend to have forgiving standards. Were there primarily for the drama on the ocean not whatever drama is happening on shore. Like Patrick Swayze we were into Point Break for the ""100 percent pure adrenaline rush;"" Keanu Reeves undercover FBI investigation was just the motor that drove us to the beach. From Gidget onward the viewer has tended to pay for the vicarious thrill of being up close and personal with the waves (and often body doubles for the stars) by enduring dialogue along the lines of ""these waves are for the big boys."" Thats from Blue Crush and quite possibly half the surfing movies ever made where someone is always telling the hero or heroine theyre in over their head. The imminently forgivable surfing drama Chasing Mavericks which is based on a true story is about some very big waves the biggest in California and a boy named Jay Moriarity (Johnny Weston) who dreamed of riding them. The movie aims to be inspirational and for the most part it is in much the same bittersweet way as the baseball movie The Rookie. Its too poetically inclined to talk about adrenaline rushes (even while serving up a few) although it doesnt entirely escape the cliches. ""Untrained boys dont just step into the ring with Mike Tyson"" Santa Cruz surfer Frosty Hesson (Gerard Butler) growls when the 15-year-old Jay begs Frosty to take him to Mavericks. The surfing spot is a legend a place where a winters northwest swell can build 50-foot waves but in 1994 at the time the story takes place its location just north of Half Moon Bay was still a closely held secret among local surfers. (READ About Gerard Butlers romantic comedy history) Naturally the curmudgeon caves and agrees to train the boy who is already a gifted surfer a ballet dancer on a board. Weston a Christopher Atkins look-alike who does most of his own surfing (as did Butler who is trim and fit as a fiddle) seems like a natural reaching out easily to affectionately touch the inside curve of a wave as if it were a friendly elephant at the zoo. Co-directors Curtis Hanson and Michael Apted (who finished the film after Hanson had a health crisis) focus on the deepening relationship between Frosty and Jay as the training unfolds. Frosty sets physical goals for Jay--hold your breath for four minutes eat well be able to paddle a 36-mile distance from Santa Cruz to a point in Monterey--as well as spiritual and intellectual exercises including writing essays on topics like ""fear"" and learning what Frosty calls ""the four pillars of life."" I believe that Frostys first pillar has to do with observation the second with fear being healthy and panic deadly but I confess that in spite of a measured convincing performance by Butler I lost track of the other pillars and can only tell you they are noble sensible and Oprah-esque. Jay doesnt seem to need instruction on decency though. Hes depicted as having a deadbeat dad and being raised by a single mom (Elisabeth Shue) from the age of 8 but he doesnt drink or do drugs or chase girls (hes too busy gazing longingly at his childhood best friend Kim played by the stunning Leven Rambin aka Glimmer from The Hunger Games). Hes helpful to his slatternly mother dumping her booze down the drain and waking her for work in the morning (""Youre going to lose your job again""). When other kids sneer and call him ""little trash"" or refer to Frosty disparagingly as his ""rent-a-Daddy"" Jay just smiles calmly and turns his hopeful blue eyes to the always-welcoming sea. (READ About the quest to ride a 100-foot wave) By all accounts the real Jay Moriarity who got famous in the surfing world after surviving an epic wipeout at Mavericks was just as zen although Chasing Mavericks puts some Hollywood gloss on his and Frostys story. The movie Frosty has Jay on a 12-week training program for Mavericks; in reality Hesson trained Moriarity for two years. Moriaritys iconic tumble the one that landed him at 16 tiny atop a monster wave and poised to fall on the cover of Surfer magazine took place eight months after hed started surfing Mavericks; in the movie it happens on his very first big wave. In interviews the real Frosty who wrote a book about Mavericks seems a jovial sort--he happily trained many young surfers not just Jay. My hunch is that Frostys movie moodiness may be amped up to maximize the tension as to whether hell keep training Jay or not. At times the character is a little baffling particularly his avoidance of his own children which his saintly wife Brenda (Abigail Spencer daughter of famed surfer Yancy Spencer) is always gently chiding him about. But much of the drama that swirls around these characters including one untimely and unexpected death is true to life. (I thought oh come on they must have made that up.) When one of Frostys surfing buddies all played by real Mavericks stalwarts surveys the pummeling surf  and warns gloomily that ""Someones going to die out there"" it may seem overly dramatic but champion surfer Mark Foo did die at Mavericks just a few days after Moriaritys crazy ride. (SEE Footage of the big waves at Mavericks) Chasing Mavericks may treat its characters with a little too much reverence but it gives its titular subject its awe-inspiring due. When we finally see Mavericks in full churn the waves tower and crash impressively. Our proximity to them is breathtaking; look for a shot where a sizable boat nearly gets swamped by a wave. But the edits and cuts required to keep the focus on a character mean youre never quite getting the visual whole you long for. Watching Jay catch waves theres a terrifying angle the sea seems a whirlpool then suddenly there he is paddling through something that seems almost placid. Then theres the jarring meanwhile-back-on-shore static shot of Butler holding binoculars and looking anxious. Every surfing feature film is a bit of a tease; those in search of verisimilitude would do better to rent a documentary like Riding Giants. (Or go surfing themselves.) But Chasing Mavericks is still a sweet ride worth catching. Mary Pols MaryPols Mary Pols has been reviewing film and occasionally books for TIME since 2009.

(AP Photo/Twentieth Century Fox John P. Johnson) <<123>>Peter Mel -- big-wave surfer actor movie consultant -- stood outside the Santa Cruz premiere of ""Chasing Mavericks"" wearing the look of a proud big brother. And why not?""Chasing Mavericks"" had trained its glossy big-budget Hollywood lens on the surfing culture and did something unheard of It got it right.The visual stunner is built around a meaningful storyline told true to spirit through believable characters. Its a surf flick that doesnt make you want to stand up and shout in your best Jeff Spicoli voice ""Dude this is garbage bro""The film from veteran directors Michael Apted (""The Chronicles of Narnia"") and Curtis Hanson (""8 Mile"") takes the genre of ocean culture to places Frankie Avalon Keanu Reeves and Sean Penn could never comprehend. And therein lies the difference sincere investment.While the front-line actors (Gerard Butler Leven Rambin and Jonny Weston playing real-life surfers characters Frosty Hesson Kim Moriarity and the late Jay Moriarity) were not surfers and did not grow up in surf towns such as Santa Cruz they went to great lengths -- even dangerous lengths -- to understand the material they were portraying.It still wouldve been easy for the cheap-thrills Hollywood machine to muck it up. Credit a production team committed to bucking the trend by shooting on site in Santa Cruz and Half Moon Bay and by employing the careful watch of consultants such as Mel Hesson and the Moriarity family.Advertisement ""As a surfer you wonder Am I going to be proud of it? or say Damn they did it again "" Mel said. ""I actually am proud of it. First and foremost they hit the mark on Jay and his legacy. And its also a pretty real portrayal of the sport we do.""Oh its not perfect. Butlers pesky brogue and a somewhat clumsy brushing past of topics such as surf turf wars and localism are glaring. There also is some looseness with fine details that will gnaw on longtime observers of surfing Santa Cruz and the monster wave near Half Moon Bay.But the core is solid a humanity ever-present -- which was perhaps inevitable with the focus on the ebullient Jay Moriarity. He was the quick-smiling Pleasure Point kid who became an instant patron saint for stoked human beings everywhere upon his drowning off the Maldives in 2001. He was 22.""Live Like Jay"" had remained a key virtue inside and outside of Santa Cruz surf lineups for more than a decade after Moriaritys death -- long before Hollywood came knocking.""Chasing Mavericks"" zooms in on a 12-week period in the winter of 1994 when Hesson a restless big-wave hunter whose charging days are numbered tucks the young high schooler struggling to help keep his single mom afloat under his wing. A rigorous Mavericks training crash course ensues as does a relationship like Mr. Miyagi and Daniel from ""The Karate Kid"" -- only with intense cross-bay paddleboarding and essays on swell observation and fear supplanting fly swatters and car wax.The father-son relationship between Frosty and Jay and the inevitable pairing of Jay and Kim are nice complements to the overall theme What drove a 16-year-old kid to strive for something only the heartiest -- some would say craziest -- adults ever aspire to?Fortunately there are some tangible -- dare we say believable -- answers provided about Moriaritys inner tickings. And the visuals captured above and below the water at Mavericks not to mention a sound quality that rumbles beneath theater seats should leave moviegoers with a true appreciation for big-wave surfers.Butler certainly has one. He endured a frightening two-wave hold-down at Mavericks and was rushed to the hospital when a wave shifted while filmmakers were trying to frame a paddleout shot in December. Even though that was on a ""small day"" by Mavericks standards those 20 feet of whitewater -- and the ensuing test of mental and physical strength -- will be seared into Butlers brain forever.What could speak more to the authenticity of Hollywoods first true surf film?Mark Conley is a deputy sports editor for the Bay Area News Group who lives in Santa Cruz and follows the world of surfing and Mavericks.

Share Tweet Surfer Jay Moriarty who died in a diving accident the day before his 23rd birthday achieved fame by surfing Mavericks a famously forbidding California surfing spot. Theres no doubt a fascinating story in that about the drive and commitment it would take a kid to achieve such a feat at such a young age. Its unlikely however that it resembles The Karate Kid as closely as Chasing Mavericks a family-friendly retelling of Moriartys life. Gerard Butler co-stars as Frosty Hesson Moriartys mentor portrayed here as a bearded crusty surf-Miyagi to Jonny Westons worshipful Daniel-san. The son of an absentee dad and a mother (Elisabeth Shue) who spends half her time in an alcoholic fugue Weston worships Butler a lifelong surf enthusiast who lives next door. Having lost his parents when he was young Butler has a hard time relating to kids whether theyre his own or neighbors eager to learn the ways of the surf. But over the course of the film he learns to open up his heart a bit. Or something. Chasing Mavericks has two credited directors Curtis Hanson and Michael Apted. Apted assumed directing duties after health issues sidelined Hanson but that only partly explains the films tattered nature. Most of the relationships--even the central one between Weston and Butler--play as half-developed and there are several subplots so clouded in vagaries that they make little sense including Westons friends growing drug habit the taunts of some bullying rivals and a tenuous romance between Weston and neighbor Leven Rambin. It doesnt help that the characters have so little to them. Weston plays Moriarty as such an unfailingly good temptation-free kid that he only needs a halo floating above his pre-Raphaelite curls to complete the picture. Some exciting surfing sequences would let audiences forgive a lot of this but while Chasing Mavericks has a couple of eye-catching moments it doles them out stingily. Instead it offers scenes where Butler tasks Weston with writing an essay in preparation for taking on the big wave or makes him clean up his yard or forces him to wax cars. (Oops. Wrong movie.) All that time might have been better spent explaining the mechanics of surfing or even the appeal of the sport and the culture around it. Maybe Chasing Mavericks assumes other surfing movies have done that work for it. It certainly counts on other movies for what it does choose to include.
