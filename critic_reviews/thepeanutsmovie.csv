Photo Blue Sky Animation MOVIE REVIEW The Peanuts Movie Running time 88 minutes. Rated G. Good grief This painfully sincere animated feature seems aimed less at contemporary kids than nostalgic adults who might buy toys marketed for what is being billed as the 50th anniversary of the Peanuts gang for their children and grandchildren. Charles M. Schulzs beloved comic strip actually began in 1950 (it ran until his death in 2000) and was remarkably dark and psychologically complex in its early years paving the way for the likes of Garfield and Calvin and Hobbes. The new feature is mostly a series of curated (by a team including Schulzs son and grandson) greatest-hits moments from the famous and increasingly cheerful TV specials that ran from 1965 to 2006 with Vince Guaraldis iconic musical theme popping up repeatedly. The Peanuts gang.Photo Twentieth Century Fox and Peanuts Worldwide LLC If the new movie were set in the present day -- instead of a tablet-free past that appears to be around 1965 -- Charlie Brown would be labeled a chronic underachiever with an unhealthy obsession for the (personality-free) Little Red-Haired Girl and Lucy van Pelt a bully who now charges 5 for ""psychiatric help."" Rendering the Red Baron-fighting Snoopy and way too many supporting characters in 3-D and placing them in near-photo-realistic backgrounds drains much of the charm from ""The Peanuts Movie"" which peaks with Schroeder performing the 20th Century Fox fanfare before the opening title. Thats at least something we havent seen before.

By J.R. Jones Jr_Jones The Peanuts Movie The Peanuts Movie  Directed by Steve Martino Peanuts would never have been any good without the grief. When Charles Schulzs daily comic strip debuted in 1950 it offered cute jokes about neighborhood kids and their dog but as Schulz began to find his characters in the late 50s and early 60s--the depressed Charlie Brown the hardened Lucy the insecure Linus the monomaniacal Snoopy--Peanuts developed an emotional depth that made it hilariously funny and revolutionized the art form. Last week The Peanuts Movie brought Schulzs cast of characters back to the big screen for the first time in 35 years adding the modern technology of 3-D animation to give the characters physical depth. But emotional depth is another matter--this is a G-rated movie and in America we try to protect children from not only sex and violence but also unhappiness. Granted The Peanuts Movie could have been much much worse. The team behind it--producer Paul Feig who created the cult NBC comedy Freaks and Geeks and coscreenwriters Craig and Bryan Schulz the cartoonists son and grandson--have made a sincere effort to honor the strip. Unlike the 2-D Peanuts features released from 1969 to 1980 (A Boy Named Charlie Brown; Snoopy Come Home; Race for Your Life Charlie Brown; Bon Voyage Charlie Brown) the new movie offers no big adventure catapulting the gang to some exotic location. The story is a simple matter of Charlie Brown trying to impress the little red-haired girl he adores punctuated by Snoopys ongoing fantasy of battling the Red Baron in the skies and affectionate replays of some of Schulzs most durable gags (Lucys psychiatric booth Schroeders obsession with Beethoven Charlie Browns doomed attempts at football baseball and kite flying). I must confess I held out little hope for the movie after hearing Craig Schulz interviewed on NBCs Today Show marvel at peoples continued devotion to ""the brand."" Charles Schulz spent much of his professional life trying to square the circle between Peanuts the strip--which he personally wrote drew inked and lettered for 50 years--and Peanuts the brand which made him fabulously wealthy but steadily cheapened his creation. The friction dated back to 1959 when he licensed the characters to Ford Motor Company for a series of magazine ads and TV commercials and it built steadily after Schulz having turned down offers for years finally agreed to bring the Peanuts gang to television for their own yuletide special A Charlie Brown Christmas (1965). Once the TV specials began Peanuts really became part of the cultural firmament and toy merchandising of the characters exploded. The strip had always been intended for adults but the brand was aimed at kids. A Charlie Brown Christmas an instant classic set a lot of the aesthetic parameters that would govern The Peanuts Movie. In bringing the characters to the screen director Bill Melendez stuck closely to Schulzs vision relying heavily on the profile and three-quarter poses familiar from the strip. Schulz threatened to walk if there were a laugh track on the special and without it the animation had a deadpan comic force. He lobbied for the voice actors to be not professionals but kids recruited at auditions and their unschooled delivery added to the characters charm. Any adults were kept offscreen and represented on the soundtrack by the meaningless wah-wah of a muted trombone. Instead of scoring the special with goofy cartoon music the producers recruited jazz pianist Vince Guaraldi whose up-tempo signature tune ""Linus and Lucy"" and wistful ballad ""Christmas Time Is Here"" would become standards. All of these traditions are honored in The Peanuts Movie whose 3-D animation raises some interesting formal questions. The strip often transpired in a ruthlessly two-dimensional world--think of the line drives that would flatten Charlie Brown on the pitchers mound or his futile runs at Lucys football or even the characters conversing with their elbows propped on a long brick wall. Snoopys doghouse entered the strip at a three-quarter angle but eventually Schulz took to rendering it as purely two-dimensional with Snoopy impossibly stretched out along the edge of the roof. Steve Martino director of The Peanuts Movie gets some great 3-D effects when Snoopy is zooming around after the Red Baron (first on his house and then in a Sopwith Camel) but for the most part he respects the two-dimensional origins of the material. The characters are filled out somewhat--rather like those little plaster statues you can buy--but theres minimal ""inbetweening"" (the intermediate drawings between poses) so the characters tend to rest at the same old angles. In the figurative sense though the characters sharp edges have been filed down. Relatively little screen time goes to Lucy a girl of such acrid bitterness and fearsome rage that you pity the man she will marry. (Schulz based her on his first wife Joyce Halverson who had a talent for slicing and dicing him.) Theres even less of Linus whose high-minded philosophical and religious statements are undercut by the naked need of his blanket addiction. Charlie Brown is the same well-intentioned loser but theres nowhere near the level of agony he suffers in the strip (so severe that a frequent punch line is ""My stomach hurts""). Even the first Peanuts movie A Boy Named Charlie Brown (1969) was more traumatic with its scene of Charlie Brown being humiliated in a nationally televised spelling bee and its nocturnal sequence of Linus looking like a junkie from Panic in Needle Park as he trudges around Manhattan in search of his lost blanket. This kind of pain made Peanuts startling to newspaper readers in the 1950s but no one wanted to produce TV specials called Youre Unlovable Charlie Brown or Your Friends Are Cruel and Selfish Charlie Brown or Even Your Dog Is Just Using You Charlie Brown Pain is not something you want associated with your brand. (A spoiler follows.) Charlie Brown spends most of The Peanuts Movie longing for the little red-haired girl (who is pictured onscreen in contrast to the unseen unheard girl in the strip). ""If I was something and she was nothing I could talk to her"" he tells Lucy his five-cent shrink. ""Or if she was nothing and I was nothing I could talk to her. But shes something and Im nothing. So I just cant talk to her."" In the end though the little red-haired girl sees the worth in him that everyone else has overlooked and romance blooms. A Charlie Brown who scores with the ladies?

I canat make any great claims for it but it feels like the return of an old friend. 292 Shares Share 276 Tweet 7 Share 9 Share Email Print Share Photo Twentieth Century Fox At first glance The Peanuts Movie seems like a bad idea. To take the classic Bill Melendez-directed Peanuts specials of the 1960s and 70s --A handmade slight charming little toss-offs that nevertheless have had a strangely enduring pull over the years -- and adapt them for the hyperadrenalized CGI 3-D age feels like youre crossing two streams that should never meet. So watching the film itself comes as something of a relief Somehow this Peanuts feels familiar even cozy. I cant make any great claims for it but it feels like the return of an old friend. One thing that makes the Peanuts stories resonate so much has been their very wise realistic understanding of human behavior. The appeal of Charlie Brown as a character of course is immediate We all feel like him from time to time. Some of us more than others sure but go find the most popular confident kid at any elementary school and theyll probably have more than their share of Charlie Brown moments when theyre either mired in self-doubt or feel like the one person who somehow missed the assembly where crucial life lessons were doled out. Related Stories Vultureas November Movie-Preview Power Rankings The Peanuts Movie does a solid job of indulging Chucks haplessness while offering the requisite rays of hope. We start with him trying and failing to fly a kite in winter -- ever resourceful hes convinced this seasons a better time for it since the kite-eating tree that always foils him wont be as big of a factor -- and proceed swiftly to his adoration of the notorious Little Red-Haired Girl whos just moved into town. Much of the film focuses on Charlie Browns self-defeating attempts to woo his eternal object of affection. Hes his own worst enemy in that regard -- praying shell sit next to him on the school bus and then when she does so immediately disappearing under the seats and crawling away. If things start to look good hell find ways to bring himself down. ""Im not ready for a relationship"" he declares at one point. ""What if I need a mortgage? I cant afford an escrow ... This could be the worst thing that ever happened to her"" When things do objectively go his way -- as they do when against all expectations he gets an elusive perfect score on a surprise test in school we know that something will come around to pull the rug out from under him. Meanwhile Snoopy continues to be a beacon of confidence and competence -- somehow both Charlie Browns wingman and his foil. Running concurrently with his owners story is the iconic beagles own adventures -- part of a novel hes writing of course -- as a World War I flying ace fighting the Red Baron and pursuing a beautiful fellow flying dog named Fifi. These are the moments when the film most indulges in the 3-D action-y stuff but to its credit it remains in the simple aesthetic of the old Peanuts specials. For all his imaginative flights of fancy Snoopys still a Midwesterner at heart; his doghouse/plane is still firmly planted on the ground. The Peanuts Movie is a little whisper of a movie and you may find yourselfA feeling the following day like you saw it months ago. That might actually be part of its accomplishment. Those classic TV specials were defined by their imperfections by their homespun quality which seemed to fit with Charlie Browns own sense of provincial modesty -- and that in turn probably reflected Charles Schulzs own view of life. One could say that the Peanuts strips and shows themselves have endured over the years in part because they hearken back to a simpler time. The same could now be said for this film.

Many of the old exchanges and punchlines have been preserved completely intact. Creator Charles Schulzs scribbled facial expressions endure on the newly rounded heads and the essential sweetness and humanity are still in place despite the slings and arrows of outrageous childhood fortune. (Hello kite-eating tree.) But those slings and arrows? Blunted just like the suffering they so famously cause our hero. And without suffering Peanuts becomes little more than wholesome distraction for kiddies. Which is pretty clearly the goal here -- viz. the primary-color obviousness of lines like ""Charlie Brown is not a quitter"" ""That was a very brave thing you did Charlie Brown"" and ""It must feel pretty great being Charlie Brown right about now."" Viz. also the thin story the Looney Tunes-style visual gags and the heavy reliance on Snoopy the dogs heroic flights of fancy. Sigh. 2015. -- Matthew Lickona This movie is not currently in theaters.

Blue Sky Animation/Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation via AP Nancy Churnin The Dallas Morning News nchurnin nchurnindallasnews.com The Peanuts Movie should satisfy old fans and generate new ones (A-) Nov. 5 2015 1221pm Close Sharing really is caring... Close Join the conversation... On Twitter With Nancy Churnin Comment on one of our official threads. Share This Story Share Discuss Meh Charlie Brown may be the kid who loses the baseball game gets his kite caught in a tree and has the football whisked away by Lucy van Pelt before he gets a chance to kick it but give the boy they call Blockhead credit. Hes the star of The Peanuts Movie a terrific big-screen version that should satisfy Peanuts fans and generate new ones.The biggest challenge in translating the still-popular comic strip by the late Charles Schulz to the big screen is capturing the spirit of a sweet ""loser"" in cynical times that pump kids full of messages about revenge and winning.Not only do Steve Martinos direction and the script by Schulzs son and grandson Craig and Bryan Schulz and Cornelius Uliano keep Charlies vulnerabilities they double down on those vulnerabilities and lend them meaning. Charlie tells the truth as soon as he realizes that everyone is admiring him for something he didnt do. In an About a Boy-like moment he gives up his dignity and chance to impress by putting on a cow suit to help his sisters performance. The double plot interweaves Charlies stumbles on his quest to make himself worthy of the Little Red-Haired Girl he adores and his dog Snoopys fantasy sequences about fighting his nemesis the Red Baron World War I flying ace.Blue Sky Studio which gave us the wordless acorn-obsessed prehistoric squirrel Scrat from the Ice Age franchise is an inspired fit for Woodstock and Snoopy who tell us all we need to know about their travails and triumphs in barks and squeaks.The voices from Noah Schnapps Charlie to Alexander Garfins Linus echo the tones of the characters from the popular television specials with one celebrity voice Kristin Chenoweth doing fetching barks for Snoopys true love Fifi. Twentieth Century Fox amp; Peanuts Worldwide LLC via AP There arent any newfangled gadgets. Kids talk on rotary phones Snoopy (compiled from voice bits done by the late Bill Melendez) types on a manual typewriter and Lucy (Hadley Belle Miller) still charges 5 cents for psychiatric advice. In an effective bridge between past and present Martino blends Schulzs signature two-dimensional drawings of eyes brows and curls of hair on 3-D CGI animation.A wrap-up speech of the kind that Linus did so well in the television specials goes to the Little Red-Haired Girl whom Schulz had drawn as an enigmatic just-out-of-reach figure. Her words voiced sweetly by Francesca Capaldi are a little on the nose in spelling out the themes.Still its a welcome affirmation that kindness honesty and bravery matter. It bears hearing in a world that tells kids winning is the only thing and makes them desperate to do that at any cost. THE PEANUTS MOVIE (A-)Directed by Steve Martino. G. 93 mins. In wide release.

John Semley Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Nov. 06 2015 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Nov. 06 2015 1200AM EST Comments AA Directed by Steve Martino Written by Bryan Schulz Craig Schulz and Cornelius Uliano Starring the voices of Kristin Chenoweth Alexander Garfin Noah Schnapp Classification G Country USA Language English Late last week in a transparent promotional ploy conveniently tied to Halloween the cast of The Today Show dressed up as characters from The Peanuts Movie. Photos quickly spread across the Internet accompanied by disbelieving qualifiers like ""horrid"" and ""awful"" and ""nightmarish.""There was Al Roker as Charlie Brown Matt Lauer in a huge purple-blue dress as Lucy Kathie Lee Gifford in an overstuffed yellow suit as Woodstock the bird and so on. The costumes were truly horrendous. Carson Dalys Linus looked like Gollum from the Hobbit movies. Meredith Vieiras Pig-Pen was somehow even worse. And yet this bungled plug for The Peanuts Movie managed to say more about it than all the other considerably less ghoulish promotional material combined. Here were the familiar-ish faces of the Peanuts gang all ghastly and putrefied and totally repellent. It was like the prototypes of Charles M. Schulzs beloved characters had been exposed to some ungodly nuclear fallout been irreparably mutated and skittered howling and half-molten out of our anguished nightmares and onto Americas television screens.Theres a tendency I think to believe that nostalgia preserves things that its a kind of shellac safeguarding memories of things we care about. The Peanuts Movie reveals that the opposite is true. Nostalgia may offer a rosy redemptive glaze for the stuff we like - typically stuff from our youth such as Charlie Brown comics or more generally Schulzs charmingly simple notions of small-town life. But underneath that glossy patina the stuff we like rots and decomposes. Then theres only the nostalgia and the memory of the thing a shimmery sheen wrapped over a hollow centre.While its naive to expect that any media property would stand exempt from the relentless grind of rebooting and revival (and perhaps especially a property as thoroughly franchised as the Peanuts comics) theres something sad about seeing a character as sweet and simple as good ol Charlie Brown so totally ruined. The Peanuts Movie trots out everyones favourite balding child and hopeless depressive for another rote adventure where he learns the oft-learned lesson that he should just be himself. (Considering what a neurotic loser he is maybe Charlie Brown should give being someone else a shot?)This time around the anthropomorphic Zoloft tablet tries to win the affections of the new girl in school while managing his new-found fame after being fraudulently declared a genius for acing a standardized test. Theres also a bloated subplot involving Snoopy the dog pretending to be a pilot battling the notorious Red Baron chopped into the screenplay as a way of showcasing the films special effects.The animation itself is one of The Peanuts Movies few redeeming qualities. Although computer animation has always struck me as a soulless inhuman craft the technicians at Fox-owned Blue Sky Studios have retained something of the pleasing crudity of Schulzs drawings. But its not enough to cover for whats at its core a crass cash-in. (And to my eye a somewhat confused one. Does the modern Minion-obsessed child of today even care about Snoopy Peppermint Patty and the rest of them?) The Peanuts Movie is a sloppy mash-up of disconnected vignettes and rehashed jokes all lazily reverse-engineered from the premise that a Peanuts movie is a thing that people will like and will happily pay to see.Any parent thinking of doing so would be better off sitting their kids down and screening footage of the disgusting Today Show/Peanuts mash-up. Taking in the boringly uplifting message that you should accept yourself for who you are - even if youre as maladjusted cripplingly self-loathing and talentless as Charlie Brown - is all well-and-good. But watching Kathie Lee Gifford flail around embarrassingly while costumed as a cartoon bird provides a harsher more vital life lesson an illustration that nostalgia is a corrupting force that our culture is a whirling garbage gyre of meaninglessness and basically all we can do is ""AAUGH"" helplessly into the abyss. Just like good ol Charlie Brown.

Yes after a long time away from theaters the round-headed kid with the inferiority complex and the dog with the rich fantasy life is finally back and full of just as much angst as ever. But like him his films a bit of an underachiever. Of course it was a tricky proposition from the start. Made with the creative involvement of Charles M. Schulz family - but determined to win over a new generation -- it had to stay true to the original strip while grabbing fresh eyes. So yes for veteran followers there are familiar - ok very familiar -- gags recycled from the first few TV specials. And for the youngest crowd who only know Snoopy as an insurance-company shill theres computer animation and some slam-bang action. Its an uneasy mix. Although its always a treat to hear snatches of Vince Guaraldis jazzy music and see Violet and Shermie bust some dance moves the puffy computer graphics are occasionally distracting (particularly Snoopy whos given a wide variety of extreme expressions). The realistic backgrounds are jarring too. What was so charming about ""Peanuts"" was its honesty and its minimalism. The original black-and-white strip kept to a few simple lines; even the TV specials used sketchy backgrounds and big washes of color. Things didnt need to be spelled out and few things were easy or sweet. True the new young voice actors -- Noah Schnapp as Charlie Brown Hadley Belle Miller as Lucy and Alexander Garfin as Linus - are all very good and very much in keeping with previous performances. And the main story - which takes place over a school year and details Charlie Browns pursuit of the Little Red-Haired Girl - feels real. But if youre a veteran fan of ""Peanuts"" youll find yourself reminded of what happened to the strip over time A bittersweet look at childhood started getting taken over by Snoopy. The arrival of the chirpy Woodstock pushed things further into the cute; once we were out in the desert with Snoopys brother Spike it was all downhill. ""The Peanuts Movie"" shows some of the same failure of nerve constantly leaving Charlie Browns story to cut to Snoopys dogfight daydreams. Its fine at first. But the aerial action is frenetic and the beagles new love interest - Fifi - uninteresting. It feels like an obvious play for the littlest kids the plush-toy market who wont get Linus jokes. And frankly the film could use more of Linus and Schroeder and ""fussbudgets"" and loneliness and all those things that first made the strip the essential it was during the 50s and 60s before Schulz started pulling back. (Whenever Charlie Brown has a memory or a daydream things turn into old black-and-white drawings and your heart aches a little.) But at least the movie doesnt try to reboot things by giving the kids laptops and smartphones and trendy slang. (Apparently ""blockhead"" and ""Good Grief"" are still in constant usage.) It means no harm and makes no enemies. But it doesnt leave a huge impression either. Nervous to put a foot wrong it plays it safe. Of all the Charlie Brown movies in the world its the Charlie Browniest. Ratings note The film contains nothing to offend. The Peanuts Movie (G) Fox (93 min.) Directed by Steve Martino.

Blue Sky Animation Blue Sky Animation Blue Sky Animation The Peanuts Movie     Director Steve Martino Cast Voices of Trombone Shorty Rebecca Bloom Anastasia Bredikhina Rated G Running time 93 min. By Maricar Estrelladfw.comPosted 400pm on Thursday Nov. 05 2015 Thursday Nov. 05 2015 Thursday Nov. 05 2015 By Maricar Estrella Fort Worth Star-Telegram As a newspaper journalist its a bit alarming to know that a substantial number of readers pick up the paper only for the comics.So when a modern movie version of the ""Peanuts"" franchise -- one of the most beloved comic strips of all time -- comes along theres a glimmer of hope that fans will flock to see the film. Like the feeling you get every time you watch lovable loser Charlie Brown attempt to kick that football. In fact The Peanuts Movie revolves around the insecurity of the bald-headed protagonist who is always trying and always seems to fail miserably. This time Charlie Brown sets his sights on the Holy Grail of Peanuts lore the Little Red-Haired Girl. The story line shifts from Charlie Browns obsession with TLRHG and Snoopys expansive imagination as the World War I flying ace in search of his French love Fifi as he battles the evil Red Baron. Some of the transitions between the two story lines are a bit choppy. Still even my 5-year-old was captivated with Snoopys escapades.Charlie Browns attempts to win his girls heart are sweet and sad because you know it never really works out for him. This is what turned me off on all of those holiday television shows ( Its the Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown ; Youre Not Elected Charlie Brown) -- the losers never prospered but theres always that glimmer of hope just like that darn football.One of the best qualities about this film is that there was insight into the emotional endearing side of Charlie Brown. Even though he gets grief from his so-called friends he manages to smile. The Peanuts Movie has all of the elements a true fan would want -- the original characters a nod to past TV specials even a jazzed-up ""wahwah"" and youll want to stay through the end of the credits -- but like its stalwart hero it falls just short of completing the task at hand. Plus Blue Sky Films (Ice Age Rio) visuals dont stack up to its previous films nor did they warrant a 3-D adaptation.In the end the film is not great. Its just good Charlie Brown.

The one concession made for modern audiences is rendering Peanuts world in vibrant 3D but the animators do an admirable job of maintaining the feel of the source material like using a Tesla engine to power a Model T.Still the story is slight and the mild laughs are mostly derived from a sense of familiarity with the material which at times is too familiar; the film over-relies on fantasy sequences involving Snoopys battles with the Red Baron which pad its brief running time. And the endless suffering of Charlie Brown -- ""I just came down with a serious case of inadequacy"" he bemoans at one point -- will be unfamiliar to todays children who arent used to that sort of self-loathing from their cartoon heroes.But this isnt a movie for children its for parents who find these classic characters as comforting as Linus blanket. Theyll cozy up to it because of its antiquated sense of yesteryear which is what Peanuts do best.agrahamdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/grahamoramaThe Peanuts MovieGRADE BRated G Nothing objectionableRunning time 92 minutes 164 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1NvVIua MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/11/05/movie-review-peanuts-movie-preaches-converted/75267734/,200,thepeanutsmovie8,thepeanutsmovie,detroitnews

EntertainmentMovies Sorry Charlie Peanuts is a movie looking for a reason Originally published November 5 2015 at 300 pm Updated November 9 2015 at 1046 am Snoopy and Charlie Brown hit the big screen in 3D in ""The Peanuts Movie."" (Blue Sky Animation) Movie review of ""The Peanuts Movie"" The film is faithful to all the details -- the characters the dialogue the voices -- but doesnt conjure the old TV magic. Rating 2.5 stars out of 4. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic Its all the same but not the same. ""The Peanuts Movie"" the big-screen 3D debut of the classic comic strip created by Charles M. Schulz has everything youd expect the Vince Guaraldi music (including the joyously bopping ""Linus and Lucy"") the kite-eating tree the Red Baron the baseball diamond the doghouse with the old-school typewriter on top the goofy dancing the ""Psychiatric Help"" booth and all those little kids with round heads button eyes and a knack for philosophizing. But what it doesnt have is a reason to be a movie. At 88 minutes its charm is stretched out to the breaking point and you watch yearning for ""Its the Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown"" and ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" -- both tiny classics over before you want them to be. Their imprint is everywhere in this film Note the ""Melendez and Mendelson"" moving van named for the producers of the TV specials and how the kids all sound like clones of the TV voices. Scripted by a team that included Schulzs son and grandson ""The Peanuts Movie"" is scrupulously faithful to the original characters Charlie Brown is still a perpetual loser; Lucy a melodramatic bossy big sister; Linus the voice of wisdom; Snoopy the reckless dreamer masquerading as a common pet. (Its so faithful in fact that those of us who grew up with ""Peanuts"" will recognize much of the recycled dialogue.) Director Steve Martino (""Ice Age Continental Drift"") pays attention to the details and some of the visuals feel creative yet true to Schulzs vision -- particularly Snoopys lush ongoing dream-saga as a World War I flying ace. Movie Review 1/2   The Peanuts Movie with the voices of Noah Schnapp Hadley Belle Miller Venus Omega Schultheis Alex Garfin Marleik ""Mar Mar"" Walker Mariel Sheets Rebecca Bloom. Directed by Steve Martino from a screenplay by Craig Schulz Bryan Schulz and Cornelius Uliano. 88 minutes. Rated G. Several theaters. Maybe for young audiences who dont know Charlie Brown and the gang ""The Peanuts Movie"" might serve as a pleasant introduction -- its a skillful sweet-natured film with nice messages about believing in yourself and not giving up. But somehow the magic got lost along the way. Most Read StoriesThinking of voting for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson?

"Peanuts Movie The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; peanuts-movie-the ) Peanuts Movie The (United States 2015) November 05 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli Nostalgia - many movies (especially sequels to long-lasting franchises) trade in it to one degree or another. Few films however rely on its impact as strongly as The Peanuts Movie the first big-screen outing for Charlie Brown amp; friends since 1980s Bon Voyage Charlie Brown. Thanks to the ubiquitous TV specials kids today are familiar with the Peanuts gang even though the last original newspaper comic strip was published in February 2000 (the day after creator Charles M. Schulzs death).  Still the primary audience for The Peanuts Movie would seem to be the adults who grew up on the characters. Peanuts has been around for 65 years so a majority of Americans have some history with it. In making the latest chapter the filmmakers (including Schulzs son and grandson who collaborated on the screenplay) took great pains not to alienate older fans. The only concession The Peanuts Movie makes to modern animation is that it uses computer generated images rather than hand-drawn representations. (The 3-D is a colossal failure - unnecessary and at times distracting.) The overall look however reflects Schulzs strips and the TV specials with static backgrounds and a rough ""unfinished"" appearance. There are flashbacks and dream sequences when viewers are treated to hand-drawn sequences. Although the score was composed by Christoph Beck and features new music copious use is made of the original Vince Guaraldi arrangements most notably ""Linus and Lucy"" (known to many as ""The Peanuts Theme"") which is employed three times during the course of The Peanuts Movie. To the extent that the movie has a storyline its about the infatuation of Charlie (voice of Noah Schnapp) with The Little Red-Haired Girl (Francesca Capaldi) and the lessons he learns about self-worth as a result. Really though The Peanuts Movie is just an excuse to thumb through 50 years of Schulz cartoons. There are nods to the most popular TV specials - a mention of The Great Pumpkin carolers singing Guaraldis ""Christmas Time Is Here"" and a reference to Charlie Browns culinary limitations. Charlie has problems with baseball and flying a kite. Lucy still charges five cents for playing the psychiatrist. For one scene Snoopy takes on the persona of Joe Cool. In numerous fantasy sequences he becomes the WWI ace in dogfights with the Red Baron. To those with even a limited exposure to Peanuts over the years this will feel like a homecoming. Is that a bad thing? No but its more of a trip down memory lane than something new. The voice work is on-target - the child actors none of whom have played these parts before and many of whom have limited professional experience nail their characters. They sound just like we expect them to sound. The Peanuts Movie features no famous voices because it doesnt need any. Even a well-known cameo would have unbalanced things and the producers recognize that. This movie is unashamedly about Schultzs creations. What celebrity could be bigger than Charlie Brown after all?  (As a side note the late Bill Melendez who gave voice to Snoopy and Woodstock in the TV shows and movies dating back to 1966 provides the same service here via archived sounds.) Its often said that animated films make for good family fare when they work on two levels - one to engage kids and another to keep parents involved. With its wholesome characters and innocent isolation from modern cynicism The Peanuts Movie is perhaps an exception. For children enjoyment begins with the familiar characters and their amusing antics. For adults appreciation occurs not because of double entendres (Shrek) or profound revelations (Toy Story) but because this production stimulates warm memories of long-ago tender days. And that means everyone enjoying The Peanuts Movie is doing so for similar reasons regardless of physical age.

"Review The Peanuts Movie gives little grief as it straddles old and new - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review The Peanuts Movie gives little grief as it straddles old and new Spectre Peanuts signal box office rebound Twentieth Century Fox and ""Peanuts"" Lucy pulls the football away from Charlie Brown again in ""The Peanuts Movie."" Lucy pulls the football away from Charlie Brown again in ""The Peanuts Movie."" (Twentieth Century Fox and ""Peanuts"") Mark OlsenContact Reporter The Peanuts gang of Charlie Brown Lucy Van Pelt Linus Peppermint Patty Schroeder Franklin Snoopy and all the rest have come to represent a spirit of nostalgic Americana but also a world of emotional nuance not initially expected in a story about children.In the 65 years since Charles M. Schulz first published a Charlie Brown comic strip the characters have become archetypes of struggle and perseverance. Or as Charlie Brown says in the new ""The Peanuts Movie"" he has ""a serious case of inadequacy."" Part of the characters enduring appeal has been that deep down many of us know those feelings as well. Even ever-sunny Ronald Reagan is known to have sent Schulz a note saying he too identified with Charlie Brown. SIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter gt;gt;The movie doesnt try to modernize the story -- there are no cellphones or worrying about WiFi passwords -- opting instead to try to bring out matters that are more constants of childhood development. The movie is pleasant and charming but when making a big-screen adaptation of a beloved classic and genuine touchstone for generations adequate doesnt feel like quite enough. The movie isnt some kind of disservice to the legacy of Charles Schulz but it also feels unnecessary. The Peanuts Movie trailer Trailer for ""The Peanuts Movie"" which Fox will release November 6. Trailer for ""The Peanuts Movie"" which Fox will release November 6. See more videos The story covers part of a school year as Charlie Brown pines for a new neighbor and classmate he knows only as the Little Red-Haired Girl. Along the way his No. 1 obstacle is himself as he battles his own self-doubt as when he proclaims ""Shes something and Im nothing.""There are numerous digressions -- a few too many -- as his faithful dog Snoopy fantasizes about being a WWI pilot squaring off against his enemy the Red Baron.Directed by Steve Martino whose credits include codirecting the adaptation ""Dr. Seuss Horton Hears a Who"" the film is created by Blue Sky Studios the company behind such movies as ""Ice Age"" and ""Rio"" and written by Craig Schulz Bryan Schulz and Cornelius Uliano a team that includes Charles M. Schulzs son and grandson. See the most-read entertainment stories gt;gt;Open link Paul Feig is credited as a producer on the film creating a linkage between the Peanuts gang and the kids on the television series ""Freaks and Geeks"" which he created and was likewise set amid a group of kids trying to figure out the world. It is a constant that the pangs of youth are something that last even for grown-ups both as phantom memories of childhood and as distillations of the difficulties of being an adult. Filmmaker Wes Anderson has noted the influence of Schulz and Peanuts on the delicate blend of the whimsical and melancholy in his own work. The animation is notable for the way that the production team has tried to downgrade slightly from the shiny perfection of typical Blue Sky creations to at least nod toward the hand-drawn qualities of Schulzs drawings and the lo-fi feel of the string of animated cartoons that have become holiday television staples.When Charlie Brown grows embarrassed over something his face reddens in broad strokes as if someone were coloring him in and his mouth sometimes quivers as if drawn by an unsteady hand. In 3-D in particular there is something playfully surprising about seeing the squiggly forelock of hair that has always sat lonely in the middle of Charlie Browns forehead be raised slightly. Rather than a star-studded cast of voice actors the film has used actual children for the voices and it is among its wisest choices. Noah Schnapp as Charlie Hadley Belle Miller as Lucy and Alex Garfin as Linus in particular are able to make the characters their own while also capturing the voices many likely already hear in their heads. As Fifi the object of Snoopys affection within his Red Baron stories Kristin Chenoweth is the biggest name in the cast.The film struggles to hold a line between respecting the classic elements of the story and characters while also giving it all an updated feel via the visuals. A number of the skipping jazz tunes by Vince Guaraldi from the earlier television cartoons now beloved in their own right are a joy to be heard but somehow sit uneasily against the computer-generated visuals.The films end credits act as something of a character roll call with images of how they each look in the movie alongside a vintage drawing. Its a nice moment one that captures both the challenge of the film and also its modest achievements in respectfully moving things forward.""The Peanuts Movie"" falls somewhere between a tribute and something genuinely new. Whether it kicks off a new series of films will remain to be seen but the spirit of Charlie Brown will always be there to try to kick that ball one more time no matter how often it is pulled away from him. We can all learn from that.Twitter IndieFocus----------------------------------The Peanuts MovieMPAA rating G for general audiencesRunning time 1 hour 26 minutesPlaying In wide releaseALSOThe Spectre of burnout hovers over latest Bond filmRadiant Spotlight illuminates how the Boston Globe covered church sex scandalSaoirse Ronan soars in the emotionally rich immigrants tale Brooklyn Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Charles M.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateBrow BeatSlates Culture BlogNov. 5 2015 1256 PM Is a Charlie Brown Movie a Charlie Brown Movie If It Has a Happy Ending? By Dan Kois The Peanuts Movie. (c) 2015 - Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation. Spoilers for The Peanuts Movie ahead. Dan Kois Dan Kois is Slates culture editor and co-host of Mom and Dad Are Fighting and a contributing writer to the New York Times Magazine. He is writing a book called How to Be a Family. Lets start with the most important part Despite everything I feared The Peanuts Movie is not a fiasco. It is a little loud and stupid sometimes but it also retains a great deal of the charm of both Charles M. Schulzs strip and the best of Bill Melendezs animated specials. Children will love everything about it and adults will spend much of the movie in a pleasurable haze of recollection Oh yes the kite-eating tree Oh yes the wah-wah voices of the adults (performed unnecessarily but delightfully by the jazz musician Trombone Shorty) Woodstocks frozen birdbath Peppermint Patty snoring in class The movie even lovingly replicates the characters typographically expressive eyeballs ranging from single     dots when at rest to (  ) when exercised to the curly apostrophes of the truly exasperated. Advertisement If the film from animation studio Blue Sky spends a little too much time on Snoopys imaginative adventures well so did Schulz in his later years. Thats a small price to pay for a Peanuts movie that for the most part moves at a less antic pace than most contemporary childrens animation and even takes care to give minor characters the attributes they carried on the funny pages for 17897 strips. But as we walked out of the film my delighted kids asked me if I had liked it and I didnt quite know what to say. I had liked quite a bit of it but I couldnt decide how the ending sat with me. Charlie Brown spends most of the movie being humiliated mortified embarrassed made fun of and scapegoated. This is proper. The role of Charlie Brown in the Peanuts universe is to be ever hopeful and to be ever disappointed like a Prometheus who awakens every morning and thinks Well surely today no eagle will descend from the heavens and devour my liver. Charlie Brown tries; he fails; he cant stand it he just cant stand it; he tries again. But The Peanuts Movie ends unexpectedly with Charlie Brown victorious. He overcomes obstacles to reach the bus upon which his beloved Little Red-Headed Girl is leaving for camp before it departs; she tells him shes noticed all the kind things hes done this year; she warmly explains in front of the entire gang that he has all the qualities she admires. The movie ends on this moment of Charlie Brown succeeding and having his success recognized by everyone he knows and even a mid-credits sequence of Lucy pulling the football away and Charlie Brown auuughing his way to earth couldnt remove the bad taste from my mouth. Did this film so careful to hew to the spirit of its source material betray Schulz (and us) in its final moments? Is a Charlie Brown story with a happy ending really a Charlie Brown story? While I mostly recall Charlie Browns plentiful failures--all the times hes called a blockhead all the baseball games he loses all the anxieties he confesses to Dr. Van Pelt--its worth remembering that Charlie Brown did sometimes achieve success however bittersweet. Often that success came in the various adaptations of Peanuts to other media. Think of the end of A Charlie Brown Christmas when Linus explanation of the true meaning of the holiday leads the gang to view Charlie Browns sad little Christmas tree in a new way. Or Charlie Browns smooch of the Little Red-Haired Girl in Its Your First Kiss Charlie Brown--though the next day he doesnt remember it. The ending of the musical Youre a Good Man Charlie Brown even seems to serve as a model for the final scene of the film with even his greatest antagonist Lucy shaking his hand and acknowledging his worth. But these cases werent examples of adaptors adulterating Charles Schulzs vision. (Or at least not entirely examples of that.) Charlie Brown succeeded every once in a while even in the comic strip. In later years true he succeeded more; in 1990s strips he defeated the marbles bully Joe Agate and even hit a home run to lead his baseball team to victory. But even earlier in the strips history success sometimes found Charlie Brown he recovered a baseball signed by Joe Shlabotnik; he won a game against Peppermint Pattys team (albeit by forfeit); he was voted camp president (albeit with a sack on his head). He never kicked that football though. In that light Ive reconsidered the ending of The Peanuts Movie especially when I think about how happy it made not only my kids but pretty much all the kids in the theater. Charlie Brown isnt rewarded on the baseball field or in the classroom or in the eyes of any of the wah-wahing adults whose opinions in this world truly dont matter; instead the movie remedies for a moment the greatest injustice readers of the comic have always known that Charlie Brown is a good man unappreciated by those he wishes were his true friends. To see his worth acknowledged no matter how unfamiliar the scene was felt in the end lovely. Charles Schulz famously justified the endless failures of his most beloved character by observing that ""winning is great but it isnt funny."" Most of The Peanuts Movie is very funny indeed. Its ending however isnt funny--but it is pretty great. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1. Clinton Takes the Lead in First Post-DNC Poll 2.

Credit Blue Sky Animation/Twentieth Century Fox ""The Peanuts Movie"" may be simultaneously the most charming and the most daring experiment in human genetics ever conducted. At issue is whether the character summaries and back stories of fictional pop-culture figures can be passed from one generation to the next solely through DNA. How The Peanuts Movie Puts a New Spin on an Old Gag A familiar scene starring Lucy Charlie Brown and a football highlights the movies old-meets-new animation style. The movie is a pleasant G-rated grab bag of everything people over a certain age know and love from the Charles M. Schulz comic strip and its many offshoots all centered of course on Charlie Brown. The question though is whether the 7-year-old demographic will fully grasp the intricate dynamics of the universe Schulz created around Charlie Brown over many decades.Young children may have a passing acquaintance with the ""Peanuts"" gang from the annual holiday television specials and such but presumably they arent as thoroughly versed as youngsters of yore who read the comic strip daily and grew up in a time when the characters were as famous as any in the land. New Books Look at the Peanuts Gang The art and the magic of Charles M. Schulz are sometimes best viewed on paper. The main story in the film will appeal to them regardless. Charlie Brown (voiced by Noah Schnapp) is smitten with his new neighbor the Little Red-Haired Girl (Francesca Angelucci Capaldi) but all of his efforts to impress her end badly. There seems to be an opportunity when our blundering hero manages a perfect score on a standardized test and is to be honored at a school assembly but once Charlie Brown realizes that the score is a mistake his moment of triumph turns into an ethical dilemma instead.Its a bit startling and undeniably refreshing to see a childrens movie that doesnt involve a villains effort to seize a princesss kingdom or some other high-stakes power struggle but instead is driven by the small anxieties a real child might experience on a daily basis. Charlie Brown is just an ordinary kid trying to find a comfortable place in an ordinary but daunting world. Rather than taking the pint-size moviegoers in the audience out of their realm of experience the way fantasy-driven fare does this movie directed by Steve Martino meets them on their own turf. (One nice touch that young viewers may or may not appreciate As with ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" almost all of the character voices are provided by actual children not adults with childlike voices.) Video Trailer The Peanuts Movie Snoopy embarks upon his greatest mission as he and his team take to the skies to pursue their arch-nemesis while his best pal Charlie Brown begins his own epic quest back home.

Watch in Times Video >> embed The genetics experiment comes into play with the many side bits in the movie ones that will mean something to longtime ""Peanuts"" fans but go by so quickly that first-timers may be puzzled. Why is that dog trying to snatch that kids blanket? Why does that girl keep acting strangely around the piano-playing boy? How come one girl is calling another girl ""sir""? This is especially true of extended aerial battles that Snoopy has with the Red Baron (the visual high points of the movies 3-D incarnation) a sort of movie-within-the-movie that may require a little explanation. Or maybe not. If all of these things are perfectly clear to todays kiddies we will have positive proof of fictional-character DNA transference. The mind boggles. That future children will be born already knowing the Harry Potter mythology isnt too alarming but picture those infants also already knowing the more vile scenes from ""Game of Thrones.""

Courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox amp; Peanuts Worldwide LLC He may not seem it from his funny-looking round head but Charlie Brown is one of the great tragic heroes of American fiction. A born failure who nevertheless continues to believe his victories lie just around the corner Charles Schulzs enduring creation is the stand-in for our human condition We all pine for success and recognition and we usually get rocks instead. But you dear Peanuts reader probably have had similar deep thoughts about the character over the years. The comic strips picked-apart philosophies its transcendent mix of anxieties and absurdism and its seamless transition from the page to the screen in a series of TV specials and films all have ensured its pop-art immortality. For The Peanuts Movie the gangs first feature-length outing in 35 years the challenge is to introduce todays youth to that wondrous melancholy without succumbing to the same ugly commercialism that A Charlie Brown Christmas warned us about a half-century ago. Thats one tough kite to fly but the Schulz descendants who oversaw this new Peanuts avoid the obvious traps to ensure a charming harmless trip down memory lane. Schulzs son Craig produced the project co-writing the script with his son Bryan and Cornelius Uliano and they have taken the necessary steps to please the Great Pumpkin faithful. Director Steve Martino (Horton Hears A Who) and the team at Foxs Blue Sky Animation Studios lifted much of the dialogue and character poses verbatim from the strip. (The image of Charlie Brown on his pitchers mound getting the wind knocked out of him by a fastball will always endear.) Trombone Shortys got the wah-wah of the adults covered and Pig-Pen still gets to glide on a cloud of dust. The peppy score from Christophe Beck tips its hat to the iconic Vince Guaraldi tunes of yesteryear. The movie even goes one step further and resurrects Bill Melendez director and producer of pretty much every previous animated Peanuts escapade by repurposing archival audio of his comforting Snoopy and Woodstock noises. The biggest change to the original specials--3D computer animation--maintains the charming simplicity of Schulzs original drawings and the characters facial expressions look exactly as they have for decades. Remember 3D is still not the most blasphemous thing to ever happen in a Peanuts film 1980s Bon Voyage Charlie Brown (And Dont Come Back) had the gall to include visible audible adults. Yes the 80s were a crazy time for all of us. The Schulzes arent taking any big leaps with the story which sees the elusive Little Red-Haired Girl moving in across the street from Charlie Brown sending our smitten hero into a full-blown panic. ""Shes something and Im nothing"" he laments the familiar wail of anguish that defines the character. Chucks quest to be ""something"" will lead him to Lucys psychiatrist booth--still five cents unaffected by inflation--and a quest to become a ""winner"" putting him in the paths of fan favorites like Sally and Peppermint Patty. But this 2015 Charlie Brown feels safer and sappier than hes been in the past. Maybe it has to do with how often he smiles or how his poignant philosophizing has been replaced by madcap dance sequences meant to showcase an original Meghan Trainor pop ditty. Two characters crucial to the Peanuts world Lucy and Linus have muted personalities studio execs perhaps terrified of the formers caustic domineering nature and the latters penchant for quoting Scripture. And theres definitely something off about the chipper ending which milks a small internal victory to coddle Charlie Brown in a way that--well that robs him of his tragic status. Is a little low self-esteem no longer appropriate for G-rated audiences? Boundless fantasy optimism is Snoopys domain after all and maybe its no surprise that the beagles moments in The Peanuts Movie are the most charming. Its giddy watching Snoopy conjure his Red Baron battles in widescreen piloting his doghouse through a European countryside like something out of a Howard Hughes film backed by an all-Woodstock pit crew a rousing orchestral score and those Melendez cackles. This peculiar sense of childlike (or doglike) playfulness has been slumbering for decades inside that red doghouse--and for whatever doesnt work in this new incarnation abandoning Snoopy in the purgatory of MetLife commercials would have been a far greater crime. The Flying Ace flies on and alls right with the world.

(Twentieth Century Fox)By Gary Thompson Daily News Movie CriticPosted November 07 2015The Peanuts Movie finds Charlie Brown still suffering from self-esteem issues but that figures. He still goes to a five-cent psychiatrist.True to his comic-strip history motion-picture Charlie cant fly a kite cant throw a strike. We see him practicing his pitching in front of a scoreboard that reserves one digit for the home team three digits for the visitors.So not much has changed. Chuck fails at everything and from this there is no refuge. Even at home he is reminded that hes not as perceptive imaginative courageous or smart as his dog.The movie is in 3-D which is two more dimensions than Brown feels he deserves. When the Little Red-Haired Girl moves in next door a smitten Chuck cant work up the nerve to approach her.What follows is a G-rated story of stammering Chuck trying to impress the girl - pulling an all-nighter to write their jointly authored book report (on War and Peace) taking dancing lessons etc. These end in - good grief - failure and humiliation. Still Charlie soldiers on with a plodding consistency that falls somewhere between pathetic and heroic.That seems about right consistent with the Charlie we know from Charles Schulzs ""Peanuts"" comic strip. At other times the colorful upbeat Peanuts Movie seems a little too chirpy missing the unique mix of humor and melancholy that made Schulzs characters so distinctive and enduring.The Peanuts Movie aims instead for something cheerful and less complicated - and we fear less Schulz-like. Sure enough there is a scene in which a friend tells down-in-the-dumps Charlie that he simply needs to realize that hes a ""good person"" that ""people like you.""That sounds more like Al Frankens Stuart Smalley character than Charles Schulz.Charlie Brown is the fellow who hopes against all reason that when he attempts to kick a football recidivist placeholder Lucy will not yank it away.These days of course Lucy would be flagged for bullying and Charlie would thus be insulated from lifes inevitable disappointments.The Peanuts Movie sidesteps all that and rewards Charlie at last for his good intentions. I doubt Schulz would mind too much. His affinity for Charlie always seemed to come from a place of commiseration as did ours.And Charlie doesnt get the girl just a little encouragement which even Schulz was inclined to grant from time to time.There was a ""Peanuts"" strip in which Lucy did not yank the football away.Charlie missed.thompsgphillynews.com215-854-5992 The Peanuts Movie  (Out of four stars) Directed by Steve Martino.

"The Peanuts Movie is reliably nostalgic review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Peanuts Movie is reliably nostalgic reviewSnoopys imagination is as wild as ever but thankfully the makers of The Peanuts Movie tame any temptation to sully cherished memories. Would you have it any other way?The characters are up to their same old tricks in The Peanuts Movie.  (Twentieth Century Fox)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Nov. 5 2015The Peanuts MovieAnimated family comedy featuring the voices of Noah Schnapp (Charlie Brown) Alexander Garfin (Linus) Hadley Belle Miller (Lucy) Venus Schultheis (Peppermint Patty) Mariel Sheets (Sally) Noah Johnston (Schroeder) Bill Melendez (Snoopy/Woodstock). Directed by Steve Martino. At GTA theatres. 86 minutes. GSnoopys imagination is as wild as ever but thankfully the makers of The Peanuts Movie tame any temptation to sully cherished memories.Its a big wet dog kiss of an animated family film hitting all the expected notes of the Charles Schulz comic strip and TV specials that generations have loved. Article Continued BelowThis isnt the first widescreen Peanuts adaptation -- that would be A Boy Named Charlie Brown back in1969 -- but it certainly feels like it acting as if nothing has happened to Schulzs vision of small-town America since the 1970s or thereabouts. The only concession to modernity is 3D viewing.Good ol Charlie Brown as neurotic as ever is still trying to fly a kite make friends and get the Little Red-Haired Girl to notice him. His dog Snoopy with avian sidekick Woodstock acts like the Artful Dodger on the ground and a World War I flying ace in the skies of his dreams fighting the Red Baron. Snoopy also chases romance a poodle named Fifi.Linus still has his blanket and homespun philosophy. Lucy has her temper and her psychiatrists stand. Peppermint Patty is still a tomboy and dynamo. The cast members all sound exactly like the voices recalled from TV specials that began in 1965 with A Charlie Brown Christmas -- and Vince Guaraldis bouncy jazz theme from that show is woven throughout the films otherwise unremarkable soundtrack.Director Steve Martino is faithful to the episodic nature of the strip and TV shows down to the last detail the telephone in Charlie Browns house is still a rotary-dial landline; Lucys psychiatric help still costs just 5 cents. The screenplay penned by Schulzs son Craig grandson Bryson and co-producer Cornelius Uliano similarly chooses nostalgia over novelty. The story is hard-luck Charlies quest for love and friendship in the face of continuing obstacles including a kite-eating tree and yes Lucys insistence on yanking away the football just as hes trying to kick it.Even when Charlie finally gets some respect and attention perhaps for the wrong reason he doubts the motives behind his new admirers ""Do they like me for who I am or for who they think I am?"" (Wonder what hed make of ""friends"" on Facebook?)We do finally get to learn how Snoopy obtained the typewriter for his ""Dark and Stormy Night"" novel and why Charlie Browns shirts have that zigzag black strip (hint yet another accident by that blockhead).But The Peanuts Movie is for burnishing memories not burning them.And would you have it any other way? The smartphones social media and global warming worries can all follow in subsequent chapters of this freshly hatched franchise and you can bet those movies wont have the same warm glow as this one.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

We get all the greatest hits -- songs like ""Skating"" and ""Linus amp; Lucy"" (twice); Lucy dishing out psychobabble for a nickel (she hasnt raised her prices at least); Snoopy typing atop his dog house while dreaming up stories about fighting the Red Baron; and most emphatically Charlie Browns repeated failure at ... everything.Then as with the Stones and other dinosaur acts that still roam the earth we get new material the justification for cranking up the machinery one more time. As youve probably noticed thats when people head for the beer stand -- or in this case the snack bar. No one wants to live in the past but in ""The Peanuts Movie"" the old stuff still stands up while the new story is just flimsy glue holding the classic bits in place.Dont be mistaken Charlie Brown is not too old-fashioned for contemporary audiences. ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" and ""Its the Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown"" are flat-out great holiday specials. And if you think the late Charles M. Schulz was too sugary with his comic strip you need to check out the first couple of decades of its run. (You need to check them out anyway.) Theyre hilarious and often brutal in their takedown of Charlie Brown. Even later the edge was there. ""I got a rock"" from ""Its the Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown"" is one of the great cries of despair in popular culture (and one that surprisingly given everything else in there director Steve Martino didnt squeeze into the film).AZCENTRALList of movies opening in fall 2015Its winter when the film begins (thus Martino gets to use ""Skating"") and someone new has moved across the street from Charlie Brown (voice of Noah Schnapp). Mind you we dont get to this part until Martino has run through several familiar set pieces. For new audiences theyll be funny. For those of us who know the characters and the scenarios it threatens to grow monotonous.That said when the new kid arrives at school and we glimpse her through the frosted windows and all we see is long red hair maybe I started to choke up just a little.Yes its the Little Red-Haired-Girl (Francesca Capaldi) and Charlie Brown will spend the balance of the film trying to win her heart -- or at least make her know he exists. Of course Lucy (Hadley Belle Miller) is no help but Snoopy (the recorded voice of the late Bill Melendez who directed the TV specials) is.AZCENTRALThe Peanuts Movie (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsAs well as he should be since in a parallel story he is pursuing his own love interest. Sort of. After he finds a typewriter Snoopy (with Woodstock as his red-pencil-happy editor) begins writing a romance in which he saves Fifi (Kristin Chenoweth) from the clutches of the Red Baron.Thats a nice-enough plot line but it goes on far too long. Even some new bits with the Peanuts kids are funny (look for the scene in which Lucy redefines pulling names out of a hat) but the Fifi stories quickly begin to drag.The most radical thing about the film is its look. The two-dimensional cartoons are seen here as 3D computer animation. Its a bit jarring at first but after a while the shock fades. Certainly the filmmakers didnt need to make the movie look this way but since its one of the few innovations in the movie why not?Thats the real question right? ""The Peanuts Movie"" didnt need to be made but if it gets a new audience to Schulzs best work its done its job.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

But when the project is a reboot of those adults own wistful childhood memories the temptation is to make the whole movie for them. The 3D CG-animated Peanuts Movie is a weird time capsule to be sure. Kids use dial phones. There are no computers or video games. Snoopy types his ""It was a dark and stormy night"" prose on a typewriter while Charlie Brown uses a fountain pen to write a book report. But just when an adult thinks he or she can cozy up in a big soft blanket of nostalgia some auto-tuned pop song at the school dance (Meghan Trainor LMFAO and David Guetta are on the soundtrack) reminds you that its not really the 60s - just a confused mishmash of past and present. Like the half-hour TV specials of our youth - A Charlie Brown Christmas or Its The Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown - The Peanuts movie has a fairly simple plot. Just enough plot in fact to fill a half-hour TV special plus a few filler set-pieces. But since The Peanuts Movie is nearly one-and-a-half hours theres a lot of filler - bits and pieces of the Peanuts ""canon"" thrown in randomly. The kite-eating tree Linus and his blanket Sally loving him Lucy dispensing 5C/ psychiatric advice (good to see inflation hasnt affected some things) Schroeder playing Beethoven Pigpen attracting clouds of dust even in the snow Charlie Brown attempting to strike out a snowman and still getting his clothes blown off by the force of the hit. And Snoopy as the WWI flying ace. Thats practically a third of the movie probably the only part that will appeal to small children and the only reason at all to render the late Charles Schulz minimalist vision into 3D. All it adds to the rest of the film is definition in leaves and blades of grass. But to the plot. Yes Charlie Brown is a loser a guy whose every day seems a date with disaster. And hes in love with the Little Red Haired Girl - a mysterious figure in the old cartoons but right out in the open and talking here. And boy is she talking (she actually gets a monologue at the end). The twist though he was paying practically no attention to it the besotted Charlie Brown (accidentally?) aces a standardized test is suddenly seen as a genius and sees his luck change accordingly. The plot twist by the way is lifted from a classic Simpsons episode. Thereve been generations of voices behind the gang and this is a winning lot - particularly Noah Schnapp as Charlie Brown and Hadley Belle Miller as Lucy. But the most pleasant surprise is the late Bill Melendez a colleague of the great Schulz reprising his repertoire of expressive noises as Snoopy and his pal Woodstock. But I suspect kids may find these Peanuts kind of bland.

Photo Twentieth Century Fox McClatchy-Tribune News Service The Peanuts Movie stays true to the original 1 / 2 Back to Gallery There are so many ways Blue Sky Studios could have screwed up the new Peanuts movie. At some point some studio suit must have wanted to insert a flatulence joke or Snoopy writing a blog or a cross-promotion with Chuck E. Cheese Pizza Time Theater. But the beloved characters created by Charles Schulz remain pure -- at least until the sequel. Snoopy and Charlie Brown are locked in that time when a snow day meant playing with friends outside typewriters and newspapers were primary forms of communication and amateur psychiatry still cost just 5 cents. ""The Peanuts Movie"" is not perfect but it remains almost completely true to its original values. Its a snowflake slowly falling to the melancholy notes of Vince Guaraldi. About the worst thing you can say about its integrity is that the ending is maybe 50 percent too happy for a Peanuts purists tastes. Seeing the 3-D computer versions of the Peanuts gang takes a few minutes to get used to; the female characters seem to adapt the best while Linus and Pig Pen look as if they have hair plugs culled from the twigs of a dead tree. But director Steve Martino and the writers -- including two of Schulzs kin -- ease our concerns with obvious and subliminal cues. There are no famous actors voicing the children -- Blue Sky uses unknowns just as the producers did for the television-special holy trinity ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" (1965) ""Its the Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown"" (1966) and ""A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving"" (1973). The filmmakers even found a way to bring the late Bill Melendez back -- Snoopy and Woodstock ""speak"" with the familiar Melendez chirps and howls recorded before his death in 2008. Like the best Peanuts TV specials (and there were scores of bad ones you forgot or didnt see) the movie is happy to meander weaving slapstick childhood wisdom and Snoopy hallucinations around a loose plot. This one focuses on the Little Red-Haired Girl a new neighbor of Charlie Brown. Our wishy-washy hero spends an entire school year fretting over his feelings about his classmate. While the best Schulz specials showed this movie often tells. ""Remember its the courage to continue that counts"" Linus says in the first five minutes sounding like a professor of pop culture as he prompts the audience that there is dignity in Charlie Browns constant optimism/failure cycle. Co-writers Craig Schulz Bryan Schulz and Cornelius Uliano speed the gag-to-musical interlude ratio up to 21st century animated-movie levels wisely leaning heavily on Woodstock for comic relief. (If it does nothing else ""The Peanuts Movie"" makes a strong argument that everyone from the Minions to R2-D2 owe their careers to Snoopys little yellow sidekick.) After the screenwriters and Woodstock the MVP of the film is composer Christophe Beck. The movie and TV veteran manages to weave in several Guaraldi beats along with a few modern songs in the musical score -- and makes it all sound like classic Charlie Brown. ""The Peanuts Movie"" is more obvious and exposition-heavy than most Schulz productions but that doesnt detract from its more complicated adult-friendly messages. Pixars ""Inside Out"" had a tighter narrative but both 2015 animated films aim their emotional impact squarely at the chaperones in the audience and carve out buried emotions with a scalpel. Charlie Brown always carried pain in a way that adults could identify with more than children. Martino and the writers understand that. The one problem these filmmakers cant solve is how to stretch the Schulz magic into feature length. At a relatively lean 93 minutes ""The Peanuts Movie"" is still almost 70 minutes longer than the shortest of the good TV specials. Thats a lot of time watching Charlie Brown squirm and suffer even if the ending has a redemptive quality. Heading into the fringes of spoiler territory with the next five sentences Peanuts purists might argue that the movies last scenes are a little too redemptive before a post-credits sequence backs off a little. The original comic strip often featured woe with the door left open for happiness. ""The Peanuts Movie"" delivers genuine happiness with the door left open for woe. Schulz had his own chance to give his protagonist the same result as this movie in his final strips and declined. Should the filmmakers have done the same? Who knows what Schulz would have thought about ""The Peanuts Movie""? Its hard to believe he would have been anything less than thrilled with the overall effort. People who understand and care about the cartoonist made the film and it shows in the solidly made often lovely finished product. Peter Hartlaub is The San Francisco Chronicles pop culture critic.

Worse things could have happened with the first theatrically released Peanuts movie in 35 years. Unlike poor Charlie Brown himself it actually connects with the football though any yardage gained by staying true to Charles M. Schulzs gentle somewhat whitewashed vision of small-town childhood is offset by one too many head-bonking 3-D action sequences and a batch of truly dire pop tunes. (Good grief Flo Rida.) The better stretches involve Snoopy and his red-pen-editor Woodstock at the typewriter along with the never-out-of-fashion message of dreaming your way out of a jam. Charlie--""Chuck"" to Peppermint Patty ""Charles"" to the more formal Marcie these are the jokes people--is still inept with a kite still the constant target of frowny-trombone adult voices. As ever hes fallen for the Little Red-Haired Girl marshaled into a love object that barely justifies a three-panel comic strip never mind a feature. But as the films wispy narrative (largely conceived by Schulzs son and grandson) makes stops along the way of a big dance a terrifying 1000-word book report and Snoopys perpetual warfare against the Red Baron the movie begins to feel as cozily old-fashioned as Vince Guaraldis jazz music. The problem with all of this obeisance to the source (the film even revives the classic Snoopy voice of Bill Melendez himself dead for seven years) is you begin to feel encased in dirt. Unlike recent sharp-witted examples like The Lego Movie and Paddington theres zero interest in mocking or freshening up the material--think what Wes Anderson might have done with this--thus dooming the movie to nostalgic types only. It trudges along like that black jagged stripe on our heros yellow polo up and down scene by scene. When Charlie emerges from his insecurities to finally ring that darn doorbell its a positive. When stink clouds are digitally rendered around the perpetually foul Pig-Pen it feels like wasted effort.

Updated July 30 2016  1053 am Full Forecast News Sports Business Go Life Buy/Sell Movie reviews Review Its a good movie Charlie Brown By Jody Mitori St. Louis Post-Dispatch Jody Mitori Nov 5 2015 (...) ""The Peanuts Movie"" doesnt have big-name voice talent sassy sidekicks or sly pop-culture references. A welcome break from the noise of many kids flicks Charlie Browns trip to the big screen is set in a simpler times.The late Charles M. Schulzs characters still live in the same world of the comic strips and TV specials although the addition of CGI and 3-D make everything bigger brighter and rounder. Charlie Brown is still fighting the kite-eating tree. Snoopy still writes his stories on a typewriter. Lucy still charges 5 cents for her advice.Also simple is the plot of ""The Peanuts Movie."" The ever-elusive Little Red-Haired Girl shows up this time as Charlie Browns new neighbor. He quickly develops a crush but is afraid to approach her. Instead he goes through a series of typical Charlie Brown humiliations to try to get her attention. Snoopy gets his own storyline too. His soaring adventures as the Flying Ace in pursuit of the Red Baron make the best use of the 3-D in the film. Director Steve Martino (""Ice Age Continental Drift"") includes affectionate nods to the old stories often referenced in black-and-white line drawings. After a while the movie becomes an exercise in nostalgia a running checklist for longtime ""Peanuts"" fans. Unseen adults have their indecipherable honks (this time Troy ""Trombone Shorty"" Andrews plays the horn sounds). The clever opening has Schroeder playing the 20th Century Fox theme on his toy piano and Sally Pig Pen Peppermint Patty and the wise Linus all get a little screen time too.The film retains the sweetness -- and sadness -- of other ""Peanuts"" stories but at times it feels padded with one too many Flying Ace bits to fill the running time of a full-length film. But the efforts to stay true to the spirit of Schulz are worth a happy dance for kids and adults alike.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Sandie Angulo Chen November 5 2015 In this 3D movie about the beloved comic strip characters ""The Peanuts Movie"" features Snoopy going up against his nemesis and Charlie Brown trying to win the affections of a new girl in the neighborhood. (20th Century Fox) If the idea of a computer-animated 3-D version of the ""Peanuts"" gang has you sighing ""good grief"" to your five-cent therapist fear not. While plenty of other childhood treasures have been atrociously adapted for the big screen ""The Peanuts Movie"" is a sweet little gift for fans of the long-running comic strip. Based on a script written in part by the son and grandson of ""Peanuts"" creator Charles M. Schulz ""The Peanuts Movie"" is delightfully faithful to the earnest spirit of the original characters and their beloved holiday television specials. Director Steve Martino (""Ice Age Continental Drift"") focuses on several themes familiar from those works youthful angst love embarrassment and imagination all of which will tug on the heartstrings of nostalgic adults while introducing even the youngest moviegoers to the world of Charlie Brown and his pals. Charlie (voiced by Noah Schnapp) has fallen in love with the Little Red-Haired Girl (Francesca Capaldi) who has moved in across the street. Trying his hardest to impress her he learns magic tricks and dance moves; he even reads ""War and Peace."" But hes repeatedly foiled before he can find the courage to talk to her. Snoopy -- whose vocalizations use archival recordings by the late Bill Melendez -- is also in love but with the dog of his daydreams. As the imaginary ""Flying Ace"" battling the Red Baron from the roof of his doghouse Snoopy comes across a beautiful French poodle Fifi (Kristin Chenoweth). Although these canine reveries tend to go on too long the brightly colored World War I flight scenes take good advantage of the films 3-D animation. [What Hollywood gets right about Snoopy] Snoopys in love as is Charlie Brown A new tale about the ""Peanuts"" gang will tug on the heartstrings of nostalgic adults and of moviegoers too young to remember -- or even read -- the original comic strip. (Blue Sky Animation) Director Martino has captured the emotions that made ""Peanuts"" so meaningful masterfully replicating Schulzs hand-drawn expressions including Charlies sighs Sallys smiles and the exasperated yells of Lucy (Hadley Belle Miller). The filmmakers also stay true to the timelessness of Schulzs world. The only tweets come from Woodstock and Linus (Alexander Garfin) grips his blanket instead of an iPhone. Schroeder (Noah Johnston) still plays Beethoven on his toy piano and Lucy charges only five cents for advice. Parents hearts will melt every time Sally (Mariel Sheets) lovingly calls Charlie ""Big Brother"" and when Charlie -- feeling dejected at his prospects -- laments that he has no future with the Little Red-Haired Girl because ""shes something and Im nothing."" An entertaining combination of humor and tenderness ""The Peanuts Movie"" isnt just an all-ages crowd-pleaser. Its the perfect first feature film for a preschooler. Chen is a freelance writer. G.

Share Tweet The Peanuts Movie opens with a scene not dissimilar from the beginning of A Boy Named Charlie Brown the feature that first brought Charles Schulzs Peanuts comic strip to the big screen back in 1969. In both movies Charlie Brown sets out to fly a kite and fails; the chief difference is that in The Peanuts Movie perhaps trying to mimic the appeal of the beloved Charlie Brown Christmas special hes flying his kite during the winter months. Thats the Peanuts adaptation challenge in a nutshell There is both a wealth of material to pull from (baseball football camp the Great Pumpkin uncomfortable crushes Snoopys fantasies) and the difficulty of picking and choosing which bits of lore to assemble into a larger narrative--especially considering how much has already been strip-mined by movies specials a stage musical and the endlessly cycled strips themselves. Every new adaptation is the softest of reboots.Thats true of The Peanuts Movie too despite an upgrade in animation. Blue Sky the studio behind almost no good feature cartoons (including various Ice Ages and Rios) visualizes a script co-written by Schultzs son and grandson in the bright hues of contemporary computer animation with the faintest additions of 3-D textures. The kids faces do look more spherical but not distractingly so and the animators take care to render their facial expressions in Schulz-style lines rather than uncanny detail. While its more technically elaborate treatment than the characters have ever received its also gentler and more eye-pleasing than any of Blue Skys other features. Its also a neat extension of Schulzs style--though granted no one needs to see Pig-Pens permanent cloud of filth rendered more vividly.The higher production values pay off during a running series of fantasy sequences where Snoopy imagines himself fighting the Red Baron as he is wont to do. Though his imagination cooks up enemy planes and an imaginary love interest dog called Fifi (inexplicably non-voiced by Kristin Chenoweth opposite archival material from the late Bill Melendez as both Snoopy and Woodstock) the World War I Flying Aces own plane remains as ever his red doghouse. The play-pretend combat cleverly yoked to another familiar Snoopy routine from the comics finally lives up to the dogs dreams while drawing slapstick curlicues around the films margins. Its the best aerial dogfight involving actual dogs since Up. The big Snoopy sequences arent especially vital to the movies nominal plot which like the old Peanuts movies is not exactly tightly wound. But The Peanuts Movie does a better job linking together its episodes than many of the older films structuring itself around a series of mild school events a standardized test a talent show a dance contest and a book report. Theyre all occasions for Charlie Brown to attempt to prove his worth to the new girl in class the unnamed Little Red-Haired Girl. This version of Charlie Brown is a touch generic--a bumbling good-hearted dreamer without the richer more philosophical veins of melancholy that run through some of Schulzs best work. That simplification is reflected in the new movies attempt to honor the tradition of casting actual children as the characters voices. (This sounds obvious enough but stars ranging from Rihanna to Taylor Swift have masqueraded as tweens in recent animation.) Past Peanuts specials and movies used children that didnt sound particularly studied or actor-y and while this holds true in some of the Peanuts Movie casting--Linus (Alexander Garfin) and Lucy (Hadley Belle Miller) are particularly spot-on--young Noah Schnapp (the young son of Tom Hanks in Bridge Of Spies) gives Charlie Brown a more polished vocal. He speaks more clearly but with a somewhat reduced vocabulary. Still the movie does provide him with some hilariously Schulz-ish worries When partnered with a girl for a school assignment he frets about whether hes ready for a relationship that might turn into a house a mortgage and escrow. Even without dialogue operating at peak sophistication levels this charming movie mostly captures the tone of Schulzs work and the voices of his characters. Lucy lobs insults disguised as psychiatric help Linus offers levelheaded advice and when Charlie Brown achieves local notoriety his little sister Sally leads tours of the Brown home and sells souvenirs lightly kidding the strips history as a merchandising bonanza. Most of its flinches at Schulzs bleakness are minor--little moments where the movie wants to assure its young audience that the kids onscreen arent that sad or upset. That includes the sweet but not especially Schulz-like ending; the filmmakers cant find a way out of their story that doesnt to some degree give in to narrative demands for validation. (In their defense the more bittersweet ending of A Boy Named Charlie Brown probably the best possible balance of big defeats and little victories is already taken). Doubtless some hardcore Peanuts fans will shudder. But this movie hasnt been made exclusively for adult nostalgists and is something of a gift for its newest youngest potential fans. A bigger-budget Peanuts is still far more idiosyncratic than almost anything theyll see at a movie theater this year.

Director Steve Martino (Horton Hears a Who) and producer Paul Feig (Bridesmaids) bring Snoopy Peppermint Patty and all the gang to computer-generated 3-D life while never overshadowing the timeless quality of the late Charles M. Schulzs comic-strip world.The world is conspiring yet again to doom lovable loser Charlie Brown (voiced by Noah Schnapp) in every way. His pitching is still atrocious even though the mostly bald kid has had more than 65 years of practice.He quickly falls for the new student at school the Little Red-Haired Girl (Francesca Capaldi) though he misses out on every chance to talk with her because hes the least confident boy ever fails to show her his moves at the winter dance and has to do their book report by himself when shes out of town. Charlie Brown picks War and Peace for their paper one of many questionable decisions he makes during the film -- though people have done dumber things in the name of love.USA TODAYExclusive Chenoweth voices Snoopys love FifiMeanwhile his lovable beagle Snoopy -- whose barks and howls come courtesy of archival recordings by the late Bill Melendez -- has his own dreamy romance going on with his beloved Fifi (Kristin Chenoweth). Just like in the comics and TV specials Snoopy steals the movie every time he shows up on screen and his midair battles aboard his doghouse Sopwith Camel vs. archenemy the Red Baron are a big highlight. Sure the history of World War I flying aces might be a little over young kids heads but Snoopys dogged can-do spirit is enough to keep them entertained.Martino figures out a series of memorable ways to keep the hits from Peanuts classics while giving the whole crew from blanket-loving Linus (Alexander Garfin) to Beethoven-obsessed Schroeder (Noah Johnston) a little freshness. Pop star Meghan Trainor shares space on the soundtrack with Vince Guaraldis tinkling piano themes of old. And just look at the moves Snoopys happy dance is in full effect as is that unnamed kids head-bobbing thing from the 1965 holiday special but theres also a dude doing the ""Running Man.""USA TODAYExcerpt Why Jeff Kinney loves PeanutsThe creativity spills over to the technical filmmaking. The characters expressions change with the simplest line movements on their faces and Martino gives Charlie Brown thought bubbles as a way to revisit old gags such as Lucy infamously pulling away the football before the hapless boy can kick it.Even the stunt casting is inspired. Musician Trombone Shorty plays the signature instrumental wah-wahs of Charlie Browns teacher and Chenoweth lends wordless charisma to Fifi.Peanuts is all about simplicity and what the plot lacks in nuance and complexity is made up for with relatable characters whom people have spent a lifetime watching. The movie is a testament to Charlie Browns place in pop culture and a showcase for a new generation bound to fall in love with its perennially insecure star. 918 CONNECTTWEET 15 LINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1kb0bYa",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/11/04/peanuts-movie-charlie-brown-review/75109704/,200,thepeanutsmovie27,thepeanutsmovie,usatoday

Schulz (who died in 2000) the first feature-length version of Peanuts in decades is a patchwork quilt sewn with nostalgia for the little insecure blockheaded boy and his gang. But while TV reruns of Schulzs old-school specials still pull big numbers every holiday season the film disappointingly ditches the cartoonists modest visual formula for a photorealistic 3-D playground courtesy of the animation studio behind Ice Age. Even if you assume that Schulz always wanted his frozen pond reflecting lustrous light and Snoopy frolicking in a lavish Hayao Miyazaki world the animation steroids injected into the aesthetic here nonetheless shrivel the great melancholy thats so key to the comics endurance. And also its underdog humor--South Park which shares DNA with Peanuts would feel equally false in high gloss. Its a shame to see Charlie Brown one of our cultures most lovable nonconformists swing for the big leagues and whiff.

Comic strip gang returns to form. Director Steve Martino. (128) G. Empire 25 Union Square Fifteen years after the last original strip the whole gang is back for ""Peanuts"" a remarkably faithful feature starring the idiosyncratic round-headed characters created by Charles M. Schulz in 1950. Co-written by Schulzs son Craig and grandson Bryan (along with Cornelius Uliano) ""Peanuts"" is technically an update spiffed up by computer animation and incidental 3D. It looks shiny enough to keep the kids engaged but not so new and improved that itll alienate nostalgic parents. The movie strikes that balance adding a bell here a whistle there and what the heck throw in the 3D -- the youngsters will like it and producers can charge a couple bucks more. But the plot -- Charlie Brown tries to win over the Little Red-Haired Girl -- is straight from the paperbacks I used to plow though on summer nights in the 70s. Its ""Peanuts"" so Lucy is upset about something. Thank goodness (AP) That lovable loser is still chasing footballs. Snoopys still up on his house getting into dogfights with the Red Baron. And Lucys still the best mental health bargain in town doling out solutions for 5C/ a session. And Snoopy is going to battle with the Red Baron. (AP) Theirs is a world where kids cant wait to go outside and play on a snow day and there arent any parents policing the park for hurt feelings and peanut butter. And its a lo-fi delight. I was worried that the likes of ""Up"" and ""Toy Story"" had permanently raised the bar but the kids at my screening loved Snoopys antics laughed a lot and even clapped at the end. Id say thats worth the price of admission.

But the news for the most part is good The Peanuts Movie is much closer in spirit to Charles Schulzs half-century comic-strip masterpiece than say new episodes of The Simpsons are to the spirit of Matt Groening. The story -- concocted by Craig and Bryan Schulz sons of Charles and Cornelius Uliano -- is low-key Schulz stuff involving crushes ice-skating book reports a school dance and all the anxiety such everyday life stirs in our hero.Lucy rhapsodizes about the nickels she earns for her psychiatric advice the hero mopes that nobody likes him and the film has more moments of stillness and sadness than you would ever expect from a studio kids picture. Theres too much WWI dogfighting but thats the same as it ever was. Whats surprising -- even wondrous -- is how often Schulzs precisely crooked line work informs the big-budget gloss. Its there in the tufts of dust kicked up by Pig-Pen and the lumpish globs of snowflakes. But most importantly its in the faces in the mouths and eyes and Schulzian worry lines all sketched in with the raw expressiveness of pen on paper. Congratulations to director Steve Martino and his team Whens the last time a computer-animated feature showcased the power of cartooning?Related StoriesWhy Im Still Watching The MuppetsRemember the spirit of Schulzs creation has always been negotiable anyway from long before 1984s Its Flashbeagle Charlie Brown or all those decades of product endorsements. (Seriously who ever has thought I bet that depressed kid knows a thing or two about life insurance?) As far back as 1965 and the sublime A Charlie Brown Christmas the process of adapting Peanuts has been that of softening it On the comics page Lucy and company spent the first three weeks of December calling Charlie Brown a blockhead -- theyd never pass the last one celebrating his big heart with a carol.The strip was truer to the cruelty and indifference of children than its spinoffs would dare. For TV Schulz and director Bill Melendez imposed comforting resolution upon it a promise that for all their anxieties and humiliations the ol Chucks of the world will somehow win over the little shits who make their lives unbearable. Thats at odds with the strips steady calendar of disappointments which come and go with the seasons Spring is for kite failure summer is for losing ballgames and Christmas and Valentines Day -- well those only emphasize loneliness. If were comfortable with happy endings in adaptations of Peanuts -- or endings at all -- then theres little reason we should feel betrayed by hearing the voice of the Little Red-Haired Girl.The filmmakers present Charlie Browns longing as universal and perhaps it is. Schulz himself spread the pathos around Lucy pines for Schroeder and Sally embarrasses Linus with her ""Sweet Babboo"" business. All thats in the movie but only the leads feelings are treated with weight or seriousness. Peppermint Patty seems to like Charlie Brown but neither he nor The Peanuts Movie gets that thats worth noticing. Sally gets a fine anxious scene when shes a dud in front of a crowd but of the supporting cast only Snoopy exhibits much depth or soul. Couldnt some of those Red Baron battles have been trimmed to show us as Schulz did that Lucy aches too? And kids unacquainted with the characters may wonder why the potato-headed kid in the striped red top once in a while hides under a blanket.But such sins of omission are minor compared to all that the filmmakers get right. The story is all typical days and minor crises following Charlie Brown through a winter and up to the last day of the school year drifting from moment to moment rather than shoving him through a plot. The feeling at times is of taking in several months worth of strips in one go -- not reading them exactly as no studio would dare the full contemplative sparseness of those panels where Linus and his pal discuss life at a stone wall. Instead its like seeing those comics adapted by devotees of the TV cartoons Miss Othmars voice is a muted trombone the kids are real kids and Snoopys is the upset-tummy growl of Melendez director of the specials you grew up with. The kids dance.

Photo credit Twentieth Century Fox amp; Peanuts Worldwide LLC Related Ghostbusters Animated Movie in the Works at Sony Pictures Animation Justin Timberlake to Star in DreamWorks Animations Trolls Minions Animation Studio Illumination to Develop Johnny Express Feature Based on South Korean Short (Video) 2015 Oscar Hopefuls Poised to Outperform Last Years at Box Office Designed more for kids who know the characters from TV specials rather than the comic strip this cartoon tempers its boisterousness with a hint of melancholy Its been 15 years or so since the demise of the landmark newspaper comic strip ""Peanuts"" and the death of its legendary creator Charles M. Schulz which means that ""The Peanuts Movie"" will be playing to at least one generation who knows Charlie Brown Linus Lucy and all the rest only as characters from holiday TV specials. ""Peanuts"" on the page had an adult sensibility that children could also enjoy but the animated versions have always been aimed at kids with enough subtlety and intelligence that grown-ups could also be entertained. ""The Peanuts Movie"" maintains this tradition; its a kid movie through and through but care has been taken not to disrupt the gentle timelessness of the TV cartoons. (The original strips if you go back and read them never shied away from topical references.) See Video The Peanuts Movie Trailer Charlie Brown Needs a Miracle Schroeder doesnt play Beethoven in Garage Band no one has a cellphone Snoopy still composes his purple prose on a manual typewriter and the children still fill their days with ice skating and baseball. (Sure Meghan Trainor and Flo Rida are on the soundtrack but so is Vince Guaraldi.) And since every 3D cartoon seemingly must include a flying sequence Snoopy and Woodstock are there to oblige with some lengthy fantasies about a doghouse-mounted beagle facing off against the Red Baron over the French countryside. To the films credit these moments are integrated into the story more successfully than the tacked-on WWI subplot in ""Its the Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown."" Snoopys fantasies involve an unattainable love which ties in perfectly with the main plot here the sudden arrival of the Little Red-Haired Girl (voiced by Francesca Capaldi) and the flutter she brings to the clumsy insecure and generally already-flummoxed Charlie Brown (Noah Schnapp). But the plot such as it is mainly exists as a framework for beloved ""Peanuts"" tropes like Charlie Browns five-cent visits to would-be psychiatrist Lucy (Hadley Belle Miller) or Linus (Alexander Garfin) and his constant defense of his security blanket. See Photos Halloween Hijacks Daytime TV Ellens New Kardashian Empire on GMA Today Turns Into Peanuts Director Steve Martino (""Ice Age Continental Drift"" ""Horton Hears a Who"") in keeping with contemporary trends in animation has rendered these characters in computer-generated three dimensions. While Schulz himself might not have approved -- whenever you read about why he appreciated director Bill Melendezs work on the ""Peanuts"" TV specials and theatrical features the adjective ""flat"" is often cited -- the films version of this world goes down pretty easily. Did we need to see the individual strands of Friedas naturally curly hair or the fuzz on Snoopys face? Not really. Do those visual characteristics stop calling attention to themselves after a few minutes? For me yes. The screenplay by Bryan Schulz Craig Schulz and Cornelius Uliano keeps the jokes coming at a steady pace -- some of them will be familiar to fans but theyve also struck out into some new territory from a great running gag about an out-of-control model plane to a playful self-referential joke about merchandising. Also Read Why Peanuts Needed an African-American Character 47 Years Ago Today ""Peanuts"" purists looking to be rankled will no doubt find plenty to cause alarm. Theres the CG animation and the fact that we see and hear so much of the mysterious Red-Haired Girl (always off-panel in the strips though she did make some TV appearances) and a scene in which Peppermint Patty (Venus Schultheis) acknowledges that Snoopy is indeed a dog and not just a kid with a big nose. (Is this a first in the ""Peanuts"" canon?) But I suspect that for young audiences ""The Peanuts Movie"" will eventually be as much of a launching pad for the work of Charles M. Schulz as previous movie and TV iterations were for their parents. If ""The Peanuts Movie"" never quite reaches the melancholy of earlier films like ""A Boy Named Charlie Brown"" and ""Snoopy Come Home"" it nonetheless respects the importance of failure and disappointment that Schulz always included in his storytelling. The football Lucy picks up might be tactile and realistic but that doesnt make it any more kickable.

Youre in love Charlie Brown (and wouldnt you know it so is Snoopy). Thats the simple slender premise behind ""The Peanuts Movie"" Blue Skys gorgeous fans-best-friend adaptation of a comic strip that is beloved by so many around the world director Steve Martinos biggest challenge was simply not to screw it up. The late Charles M. Schulz almost surely would have appreciated the result which presents a wholesome goody-goody view of childhood emotional challenges barely advanced since his ""lil folks"" first graced the big screen back in 1969s ""A Boy Named Charlie Brown"" apart from the risky move or transforming the cartoonists hand-drawn bobble-headed characters into complex computer-generated models of themselves -- in 3D no less. While the old-fashioned story barely feels adequate to fill a half-hour TV special the new look positions all involved to make as much in tie-ins and merch as they do in ticket sales. Over the course of nearly 90 minutes incorrigible romantic Charlie Brown develops a crush on his new neighbor the otherwise nameless (and until now virtually faceless) Little Red-Haired Girl while his high-flying beagle falls for a little pink-haired poodle named Fifi an entirely new character he imagines rescuing from the Red Baron. Both the boy and his dog set their goals high though Snoopy has the self-confidence to follow through while Charlie Brown suffers from near-constant insecurity -- feelings exacerbated by longtime rival and resident know-it-all Lucy who gladly enumerates his shortcomings only to turn around and offer psychiatric help from her makeshift lemonade stand for a nickel a session. For those who know the strip well ""The Peanuts Movie"" should feel like the first day of a new school year reunited with a classroom full of familiar faces. With the exception of Fifi (who looks like Snoopy with pink pom-poms stuck to her head and ears) everyone here is a well-established member of the Peanuts ensemble and though their personalities come across as ever so slightly different (more by virtue of voice casting than by design) the kid characters are performed by actual kids Noah Schnapp for Charlie Brown Hadley Belle Miller for Lucy and so on. The grown-ups still speak via muffled trombone while Snoopys and Woodstocks voices have been resurrected from archival recordings by Bill Melendez who directed nearly all the ""Peanuts"" features and TV specials (yet another of the pics many strategies for not straying far from the canon). Over the course of an often-repetitive 50-year run Schulzs haiku-like strips were inherently too short to develop much more than recurring dynamics or themes so in narrative terms the film is obliged to lean more heavily on the propertys many previous animated incarnations (with certain lines like Lucys disgusted ""Ive been kissed by a dog"" lifted directly from ""A Charlie Brown Christmas""). What will feel like nostalgia for adults should play as fresh to younger auds as they discover the origin of Snoopys Red Baron obsession his invention of the Flying Ace character and his first appearance in Joe Cool mode. Meanwhile carrying on futile pursuits that have dogged him for half a century Charlie Brown struggles to fly his kite fails to kick his football and repeatedly makes a fool of himself in school. One can only imagine the countless hours that must have been spent debating every little detail -- from script to skin texture the density of Pigpens dust cloud to the bounce of Friedas curls -- although the creative team has been shrewd enough with nearly every one of its choices that audiences should have no trouble enjoying the film at face value. After all is there any face in cartoon history more apt than Snoopys to answer the classic joke ""Whats black and white and read all over?"" Like most classic jokes ""Peanuts"" isnt so much funny as mildly amusing which is evidently one of the many aspects of Schulzs legacy that his son Craig and grandson Bryan fought to protect as screenwriters and producers on the film (presumably trumping their genuinely hilarious collaborator Paul Feig also credited as a producer alongside co-writer Cornelius Uliano). But a little modernization wouldnt have hurt especially in the diversity department. While Franklin remains Charlie Browns only brown friend a non-white love interest would have been as progressive as Schulzs tomboyish depiction of Peppermint Patty was back in the day. From the very outset following a version of the Fox fanfare delivered by none other than resident piano prodigy Schroeder the film sets the stage with a hand-doodled snowfall squiggly black balls loosely sketched in a rectangular frame which fades from what could be one of Schulzs comic-strip panels into a pleasant-looking CG alternative. As in ""Horton Hears a Who"" (which Martino co-directed) we have entered a dynamic realm directly inspired by a visionary childrens artist except that this time instead of replicating the fantastical colors and creatures of Dr. Seuss imagination here we have the stripped-down hyper-simplified Midwestern world of Charlie Brown who is himself a glorified circle with ink-spot eyes bulb-like nose and an unruly curlicue for hair. It was no small challenge for the Blue Sky team to adapt the handful of expressions and poses Schulz recycled countless times over the course of his career into what are meant to be fully articulated CG character rigs. (The sheer effort involved will be lost on most audiences even many professionals in the animated community -- not unlike last years ""The Lego Movie"" which innovated in order to simulate the look of crude stop-motion.) Though actual hand-drawn touches do appear on occasion from floating red hearts to an elaborate animated daydream sequence the objective was clearly to find a vibrant visually interesting homologue for fundamentally flat elements all the while incorporating (or at least paying homage to) Schulzs signature wobbly lines. The cartoon that emerges is not only stunning to behold but also as comforting as a warm puppy (to paraphrase Lucy) the polar opposite of ""The Adventures of Tintin"" which committed the grievous design crime of replacing its protagonists popular comicbook face with a vaguely human equivalent. Though humans have been playing the ""Peanuts"" gang onstage since 1967 tuner ""Youre a Good Man Charlie Brown"" first bowed Off Broadway one need only consult Tim OBriens artists rendering of a realistic-looking Charlie Brown to confirm why the Blue Sky solution was the way to go onscreen. Still its consistency with the characters language and personalities that seems to have mattered most to Schulzs heirs who rightly consider Charlie Browns long-unrequited romantic obsession with the Little Red-Haired Girl to be the right catalyst to bring his inner optimist to light. As in his 1969 big-screen debut Charlie Brown has the opportunity to experience both ends of the popularity spectrum ranging from class reject to school hero. Early on Lucy convinces Charlie Brown that if he really wants to impress girls he has to show them hes a winner -- which is easier said than done for someone with a serious case of inadequacy translating to a clumsily episodic series of minor life challenges the most promising of which is a school dance. (It should be said that ""The Peanuts Movie"" has some of the most disappointing original songs of any ""Peanuts"" property.) Still what better lesson for Charlie Brown grammar-school Sisyphus that he is than to turn his loser status on its big round head and prove as his indefatigable creator did by delivering a strip a day all those years that its the courage to continue that counts?

SHERLY THOMAS says December 30 2015 at 231 pm The Peanuts Movie had something missing .Imbalance and that is not Charles Schultz should be remembered.What happened to the Hippa law? Trading health information and personal private memoirs in exchange for money.We will love his genius work and he will be remembered always Just no more talk of the red haired gal .A negative way to represent a friend as a character that was brought to screen.She doesnt deserve the limelight through the whole show. Reply Rebecca Tingbladt says November 9 2015 at 601 am The reviewer is as stupid as they come. Can the PC ""diversity"" bullshit; its Charles M Schulzs comic not Nameless SJW Hacks comic; if it were it would have been cancelled decades ago. Reply jdgalt says November 8 2015 at 211 pm If youre going to diversify Peanuts do an honest job. Show the bullies and low-life as they were in my high school. Especially show which socio-economic and ethnic groups they were and which groups the students who behaved were. (Hint the answers were probably the same at your school.) I doubt Charlie Brown or the other main characters will choose to hang around with those groups but they will have to deal with getting bullied. Charlie may succeed in running away but Linus will not. Beyond there Ill leave the details to other readers imagination. Reply AdmiralXizor says November 7 2015 at 844 pm Fifi was NOT an a new character - she was first seen as Snoopys love interest in ""Life is a Circus Charlie Brown"" - in 1980 Reply Eagle35 says November 6 2015 at 656 am ""Like most classic jokes ""Peanuts"" isnt so much funny as mildly amusing which is evidently one of the many aspects of Schulzs legacy that his son Craig and grandson Bryan fought to protect as screenwriters and producers on the film (presumably trumping their genuinely hilarious collaborator Paul Feig also credited as a producer alongside co-writer Cornelius Uliano).

And yet you would then turn around and disparage this diversity as pandering while criticizing the lack of multi-dimensional layers to these politically correct characters and nit-picking any negative stereotype they depict in your ""progressive"" eyes. There is no pleasing you people anymore. If its not inclusive its bad. If its TOO inclusive its bad. Another example of your hypocritical standards is when you bemoan the vanilla sameness of the enterprise itself. Its too predictable too ""Slender"" as you call it and the characters too plain and old-fashioned. But then you would whine and complain about Schultz spinning in his grave if the characters ever made pop culture references their personalities were more ""Contemporary"" and the humor Meta and self-aware. What do you people want? Im not even sure anymore. Reply You are a tool says November 5 2015 at 522 pm What a complete waste of print. I consider myself liberal in regards to social issues people like you are what destroys the true issues in the world. Your trivial ""progressive"" ideas is more fuel for creating the increasing bifurcation of our social politics. Nice half thought attempt to jump on the destructive PC bandwagon to try and appeal to masses as some sort of englightened individual. You are a completely shallow tool Reply Mary Mattheiss says November 5 2015 at 1204 pm Please leave iconic characters created in the 50s out of the political correctness parade of needing to be diversified. Peanuts does not need to have any other characters to make it "" better"". Peanuts is Peanuts. Leave it alone . Reply Michael Jones says November 5 2015 at 1144 am Hi Im on a scavenger hunt for the worst movie review ever; I think I found it. Reply Moses says November 4 2015 at 906 am As a minority I am saddened and a even little insulted by statements such as ""a little modernization wouldnt have hurt especially in the diversity department."" Thank you very much white people but really you dont have to take care of us by shoehorning diversity into your fictional works especially into fiction like Peanuts that already have an overt theme of the importance of love friendship and equality. Racism and bigotry in America are already going the way of the dinosaur (slowly but its getting there) without your condescending attempts to forcefully pat us on the head and remind us that were just as good as majorities so while your effort are probably well-meant (well most of the time -- its often obvious that social justice is often co-opted just to try to market and sell new things to us) theyre neither needed nor wanted. So lets try to just let everybody move forward on their own okay? Were capable of doing that by ourselves nowadays I promise Thanks Reply Diogenes says November 4 2015 at 639 pm Dont worry. Most of us whites dont want to take care of you. As a matter of fact we want little to do with you and are tired of people shoehorning you into our works of fiction. The ones responsible for this and those that support it are a very vocal minority. Reply Trent Vitri (TrentVitri) says November 4 2015 at 623 pm Spot on response. I always thought it was ironic when liberals / the left always said ""Only white people have privilege and power"" and ""Minorities will never have economic or political gain"" - really makes me wonder who the true racists are. They put down non-whites more than any other group. Reply Marie says November 4 2015 at 108 pm Thank you. Reply Ron Jeremy says November 4 2015 at 1103 am Ah the liberal trope of equating racism and bigotry with anyone who dares not agree with their worldview. And no what you incorrectly call racism and bigotry are not going the way of the dinosaur and thankfully so. Peanuts needs no modernization or diversity to pander to liberal apologists. It is perfect just as Schultz created it. Thankfully the writers and directors left well enough alone. Gee lets meet Charlie Browns new friends; Carlos and illegal immigrant and Pat a transgendered pre-operative boy that self-identifies as a woman. Good grief Reply Marie says November 4 2015 at 107 pm You sound bitter. Sharon Fitzpatrick says November 4 2015 at 823 am Whats wrong with the little redheaded girl? She maybe pasty white but the redhair DOES make her diverse. Being a 1% minority of the population Im standing up for her. Quit picking on the little redheaded girl Reply VampCass says November 4 2015 at 807 am ""But a little modernization wouldnt have hurt especially in the diversity department. While Franklin remains Charlie Browns only brown friend a non-white love interest would have been as progressive as Schulzs tomboyish depiction of Peppermint Patty was back in the day."" Are you kidding me Variety? Did you seriously just publish that in a review? ""Gee this film sure followed the source material closely but I wished they changed everything to make it more pandering"" Pathetic. Who hired you? Reply Harrison (harrison_alex) says November 4 2015 at 720 am 0/10 too much diversity Reply Jerry gonsor says November 4 2015 at 709 am Debrew Ive never heard of you until I saw you on Bill OReillys show. You recommend diversity for an animated characters girlfriend. Libs like you are always preaching political correctness so excuse my lack of it as I as you- Are you a complete retard? Writers of animated movies write what they believe children would enjoy. Im sure they do not consider what some half-ass lib movie critics thinks about diversity. The guys here at our Cleveland Fire house despise liberals who push their own agenda using other peoples work. After seeing your pic on the OReilly Factor- We also think you should try to look more like a man...not a smiling weasel.

What does this have to do with how good the movie is? Do you actually get paid to write this? Reply Hiro says November 4 2015 at 416 am So having the original characters in the movie and not force some interracial relationship because it seems ""progressive"" is bad now? This article is pretty offending towards white people in my opinion since you want to get rid of them so badly in movies nowadays. Btw Im not even white this whole leftist bullshit just seems wrong to me. Reply Jen Fleicher (idrinkyourtears) says November 4 2015 at 413 am Hey Variety I have a pitch for you A Shaka-Zulu reboot starring Elijah Wood. Oh wait that would be ""racist"" instead of ""diversity"". Reply Trent Vitri (TrentVitri) says November 4 2015 at 352 am Sorry but its 2015. Were all aware of this scam going on to promote ""diversity"" when its been thoroughly debunked so many times. For example; Hispanics are a larger minority in society yet lack any kind of ""diverse"" representation since the agenda is to default to african americans. Like I said its 2015. Nobody falls for this anymore. Reply zulgaines says November 4 2015 at 146 am You people wont be happy until everything is ripped apart and turned brown. Reply Dave says November 4 2015 at 135 am WOAHHH your right Why not add some Chinese kids too And Indians Honestly lets just change the whole cast Too many whites You cant kill reality. Anyone who agrees with this page needs to get out of their ""safe space"" the world isnt your liberal arts college campus. No one thinks this idea sounds progressive or cultural it sounds plain stupid. How about a white Bill Cosby reboot? Oh does that offend you? South Park is exposing your PC culture and will tear down ideology you call ""progressive."" Reply Ethan Page says November 3 2015 at 1141 pm No Black Love Interests Lets not ruin Peanuts shall we? Reply Jay Deal (jayrdeal) says November 3 2015 at 906 pm Nice try on the diversification opinion but no. The producers spent months remaining loyal to the original Peanuts narrative with incredible scrutiny and detail something that the IP holders demanded (and should). As with all works of art the Peanuts universe should not be altered in anyway regardless of any pc stupidity from this dumb writer. Reply timgray2013 says November 3 2015 at 923 pm This ""dumb writer"" has offered up a very thoughtful and informative review but the online commenters have fixated on one phrase. Charles M. Schulz created the character of Franklin in 1968 which was considered daring. Who knows what Schulz might have created/wanted by now? Its an interesting question but its also interesting to see how some readers are obsessing over this always with anger. Tim Gray Variety senior VP Reply Lisa Howard Glass says November 4 2015 at 1134 am ""but its also interesting to see how some readers are obsessing over this always with anger."" Are you serious? This is Charlie Brown not Bubble Guppies or Dora the Explorer Its coming off as anger because you PC robots insist on trashing every simple thing out there. And the fact that youre now calling Charlie Brown racist is equivalent to calling ME racist for not marrying a black man...no matter how I would feel about him in the first place. He may be HOT but what if I didnt have feelings for him? Oh thats racist according to asshats like you who obsess over skin color. Get over it already Its insulting to EVERYONE VampCass says November 4 2015 at 809 am Senior VP? So youre the one to blame for this terrible review? Jerry says November 4 2015 at 724 am Maybe that is because we are so friggen tired of it all. metalslug says November 4 2015 at 252 am it doesnt matter what he would have wanted then this is an adaptation of what he created. Besides we cant just ask Schulz of what he wanted because hes dead so its safer to take after him not just assume what he wanted you doughnut Tim says November 4 2015 at 244 am Man get outta here. This is bullshit and you know it Asuka says November 3 2015 at 948 pm As a ""senior VP"" are you familiar with the raison detre of your own publication? Since you encourage deviation from your publications focus do you extend the same ""journalistic discretion"" to writers while they cover other topics? Can we trust Variety to be fair in all its coverage given that you clearly feel that Variety writers should editorialize? Al Bedo says November 3 2015 at 823 pm I concur with your racial view comrade Debruge. Art should reflect our struggle. Reply Ethan Page says November 3 2015 at 1149 pm But NOT Peanuts Reply Steven says November 3 2015 at 614 pm Really? Regarding the charlie brown love interest. The left is running amok. By being so silly you lose credibility. So sad. Reply Asuka says November 3 2015 at 613 pm THE PEANUTS MOVIE? Really? Cant a cartoon just be a cartoon not yet another opportunity to foist your agenda on small children? Is everything to be used as a propaganda tool? Is there anything that the progressive left wont try to politicize? Is there any limit to white progressive guilt? Dont bother replying - I know the answers. Reply Jimmie says November 3 2015 at 608 pm I believe there was a poodle named Fifi that belonged to a circus act that Snoopy fell in love with in a older cartoon. They had a trapeze act together. Snoopy was colored pink. Reply DJazz says November 3 2015 at 533 pm Fortunately the silent majority does not live in a bubble of a PC pixie-dusted white guilt liberal fantasy world. Sure there are an extreme few interracial couples but they are not the main stream. Most races date and marry their own races. Thats the reality. When does the insanity stop? Whats next? Mandating that our next president have a spouse of a different race because its the 21st Century? Why would that idiocy not be any different? That in and of itself is EXACTLY what racism is We the people are getting sick of all this PC nonsense shoved down our throats in this case hidden under the guise of a cartoon being outdated from the segregated 1950s. There is a reason why the state of Hollywood is in such decay over the past 25 years as is TV. People are SICK AND TIRED of being lectured to and vote with their wallets. Just when I thought I had read the most idiotic liberal column of the week already along comes this gem. Im surprised Drudge hasnt picked this up. Reply ejazzyjeff says November 3 2015 at 1222 pm Im finally glad to see a lot of other people get just as irate as I when PC is crammed down our throats. It is going to be funny how (hopefully) this non-PC movie just blows out the box office proving just again that the average person is tired on PC and just want to see the movie you should learn from them Muppets Reply Marv L Shedley (MarvLSOne) says November 3 2015 at 1027 am Maybe they should have had Charlie Peppermint Patty and Franklin in a hot-tub threesome eh? That would have covered the race issue the war on women issue and the gay issue. Get over your childish P.C. nonsense will ya? Reply energyman says November 3 2015 at 1012 am Darn social justice warriors.This is why South Park has been mocking you so much this season. Save your PC propaganda for the democratic national convention. This is a kids movie for crying out loud. Reply Darren PackerNerd Kruschke says November 3 2015 at 956 am Can I be a cry baby too? I want a white kid on Fat Albert and other black cartoons. I am sorry for you. You must be absolutely paranoid and if you dont find something racist you go out looking for it. Peanuts is a classic. It doesnt need to be changed. Racism has nothing to do with flags and cartoons. If children can not be raised to tell the diference between reality and a cartoon that is a shame. My kid is a blonde haired blue eyed kid but not not racist at all. It has to with the way he was raised. You can whitewash everything in American Culture racism would not ever go away. Reply warrenjasonstreet says November 3 2015 at 912 am No no no and no again. Peanuts was a dark miserable strip and theres no misery here. Theres just marketing marketing and marketing. Schulz would have hated this film sight unseen and he would have disowned his children for acquiescing to this abomination. Oh sure. He would have cashed the checks. But this film perverts the legacy of the strip in ways only a salesman would love. Reply Ethan Page says November 3 2015 at 1145 pm No Schulz would have hated your comment. HE WOULD HAVE LOVED THIS MOVIE Reply Occultology says November 3 2015 at 909 am You are not a movie reviewer you are a minister of propaganda. Reply Big Dumb Ape says November 3 2015 at 815 am The reason people are reacting so strongly to the one sentence saying that the movie would have been better or hipper (or whatever word you want to use) if Charlie Brown had a ""non-white"" love interest is because (1) that has NOTHING to do with the movie itself so (2) that notion literally screams out at the average person and causes them to groan given its obvious eye-rolling lecture-some PC intent. Because once again its this silly progressive ideal raising its head to the point where people cant even enjoy a freaking cartoon these days unless it is PC driven. The other reason people are reacting strongly is because this same PC notion is constantly being rammed down everyones throats to the point that you feel you cant get away from it. Because it feels like Hollywood has gone crazy feeling it has to lecture everyone on what liberal Hollywood wants to promote -- the viewing audience be darned. A perfect example -- the new SUPERGIRL tv show where they not only felt the compelling need to turn classic comic book character Jimmy Olsen into a black male but -- as the icing on the cake -- when another character (Winn who is white) showed his attraction to Kara (the white female lead) and hinted at his crush by explaining that when you meet someone ""special"" you feel a ""ka-pow in your stomach"" -- sure enough -- she ignores Winn but smiles sexily and says ""ka-Pow"" when she meets new black Jimmy Olsen. In short the producers not only had to make a classic white character black but introduce an interracial romance in the same breath. And to be honest since they went that route I was actually shocked that they didnt make the Winn character gay while they were at it. Because then the producers would have been firing on ALL the groan inducing eye-rolling required PC cylinders for any current movie or TV show. Reply Victor Field says November 3 2015 at 438 am That most of the responses so far are from people complaining about one pro-diversity sentence says more about them than the reviewer. Reply Eagle35 says November 6 2015 at 143 pm Ever read Ray Bradburys Fahrenheit 451 Victor? Amongst many of the books themes like television driving the ruination of critical thought its also about the fear of offending minorities so the mainstream start editing out all the Politically Incorrect Offensive material from books as a whole until nothing remains but a tapioca pudding trifecta of blandness. This is what you and others like yourself are preaching. That we start changing things like films so as not to rankle the PC sensibilities of people like you. Keep everyone ""Happy"". I dont want to live in that world. Ill take The Peanuts Movie as is over something like ""The Peanuts Diversity Quota Hour"" any day. Reply Lisa Howard Glass says November 6 2015 at 1203 pm No Victor. Its not about being ""pro-diversity."" Its about being true to the Charlie Brown character and this nonsense of coming thisclose to calling anyone who actually liked Peanuts a racist because he always had a crush on a little red haired girl instead of a black girl. Why inject race into it when its JUST A FREAKING CARTOON????? People are sick amp; tried of political correctness being shoved into everything. THATS what it says about the responses Reply JSA says November 3 2015 at 557 pm No Victor it does not. Its a cartoon. ""Progressive"" or ""Conservative"" have no place. And you seem to be a pompous judgmental fool. Like the reviewer. THAT""S what these people are railing about. Being lectured and having ANY values jammed up their poop in a cartoon. Says everything about you that you defend this claptrap. Reply Gerard says November 3 2015 at 416 am ""Movies dont always have to push your liberal fantasies Peter"" I completely agree What the heck is wrong with just liking the movie for what it is. Those creepy liberals ALWAYS have to whine and complain about just ANYthing. Come on het a Life its a movie a kids movie not some kinda political propaganda. Please keep it that way. If everything has to be propaganda please buy a ticket to North Korea and let us just enjoy life as it is Reply Susan says November 4 2015 at 1203 am Im a liberal and even I think its getting crazy. The Civil Rights Movement was about equal rights for all not about dictating who people should be in relationships with. Now children programming has to be rewritten because two white people in a relationship is not modern or progressive? Enough already. Reply jon says November 3 2015 at 332 am Movies dont always have to push your liberal fantasies Peter. Reply TC Templeton says November 3 2015 at 1241 am When film critics become social justice warriors its pretty sad. I pity the person looking at life and art through the cultural Marxist lens. Reply Gerard says November 3 2015 at 414 am Agreed Reply Marie says November 2 2015 at 516 pm Not everything needs to change or have diversity. My god what it with the PC obsession of today? Reply me says November 2 2015 at 508 pm Ive read many many stupid comments in my life. To suggest an interracial romance - for absolutely no reason whatsoever - is perhaps the stupidest one yet. Reply david says November 2 2015 at 343 pm Thankfully it sounds like they got it right The trailers were encouraging so its great to hear a strong review. For many people like myself Peanuts is sacred cartoon ground and initially I thought they would never do this justice and try to go with a PG rating and updates to make it modern. It may sound corny to a lot of people who dont get it but every year my dad and I would watch A Charlie Brown Christmas as our yearly celebration. I get choked up just thinking about how much I will miss that ritual now that hes gone. To ALL involve in this production - THANK YOU Reply HPR says November 2 2015 at 315 pm Youre a reviewer not the PC police. Yawn. Reply Chizz says November 2 2015 at 1124 am A non-white love interest?? Yeah Peanuts lack of ""diversity"" is obviously racist by 21st Century standards standards that a clown like Debruge is only happy to uphold. Reply riesen2b says November 2 2015 at 945 am Your suggestion that Charlie Brown fall for a different ethnicity while being a bold progressive move would somehow seem totally out of place in this movie. The history of Charlie Brown has always been his infatuation with the redheaded girl and to have it any other way would have outraged those who are fans of his legacy. I am all for interracial relationships since my wife and I are of different races but not for Charlie Brown. I could see it with another character where a past history had not been established. Reply Peter Debruge says November 2 2015 at 428 pm Thanks for engaging with the suggestion as something more than political correctness. This is 2015 and there are mixed-race couples (and friendships) all around in real life but ""The Peanuts Movie"" gives young audiences scant examples preferring to stay wedged in the nearly segregated world of the 50s while throwing in a bad Flo Rida song for some sort of contemporary hipness quotient. I didnt honestly expect the film to go that direction but I do think its within a critics right/duty to raise such issues. Also for the record (since others seem to have misread my intention) the Peppermint Patty comparison references the fact that Schulz was challenging gender norms of the time when defining her character as a better athlete than Charlie Brown deliberately creating a role model for girls who might want to play sports in the process. Reply Eagle35 says November 6 2015 at 136 pm Mister Debridge why dont you just chill out okay? Not everything has to be a political battle or need to have a grand political statement. And I dont think Schultz himself would appreciate you devaluing his work all because it doesnt fit your Politically Correct agenda. This is an animated movie about kids and a beagle that flies A World War Two Aircraft chasing after The Red Baron in his head. Its not a Potpourri of Progressive or Regressive attitudes. ITS. AN. ANIMATED. MOVIE For young and old alike. Im all for diversity but Holy Equity Quota Batman put away the outrage utility belt. Andrew says November 4 2015 at 205 pm Did you really just call Peanuts segregated? Youve got a lot of nerve Mr. Debruge. Robbie says November 4 2015 at 1223 pm Debruge give it up. Over 50 comments and not ONE SINGLE PERSON has agreed with you. Sack up and learn from your mistakes dont keep digging the hole deeper. Lisa Howard Glass says November 4 2015 at 1143 am Heres the problem. Charlie Brown has ALWAYS had a thing for that little red haired girl. Why change that just to pander to politically correct butthurts? It has nothing to do with challenging social norms. This isnt a sociology college course ITS FREAKING CHARLIE BROWN Asuka says November 3 2015 at 633 pm ""But I do think its within a critics right/duty to raise such issues."" Unless Variety has switched formats and reassigned you to its newly formed political corps its not your ""duty"" to do anything but critique films as pieces of art. As a MOVIE critic please base your reviews on the artistic merits (or lack there of) of the work not on its conformation to your personal political agenda. You seem uncertain about what a critic does; perhaps Variety should employ someone who is free of your confusion. JSA says November 3 2015 at 603 pm Pompous haughty and self righteous claptrap. Go work at The Nation and serve the size audience that likes being preached to at a cartoon showing or reading a cartoon review. Your defense is as silly as your article. Scant examples? THEY""RE KIDS Theyre allowed to not have ANY values jammed down their throat for 2 hours. You must be a hoot to have a beer with. Or is that insensitive to Chablis drinkers and I now need training to correct my jingoistic mindset? Alejandro Montanaro says November 2 2015 at 720 pm Did you just literally use the ""meme"" answer for this being 2015? What does that have anything to do with the fact that your definition of ""progressive"" is backwards offensive in itself for non-white people and no offense dude but really dumb. Johnny Argon says November 2 2015 at 945 am bwahahahah Playing the race card in a movie review of a live action comic strip will most assuredly have you mentioned in the same breath as Roger Ebert Reply John Th says November 2 2015 at 943 am ""But a little modernization wouldnt have hurt especially in the diversity department. "" Ahh shut up. Its a kids movie...stop injecting your political correctness into everything. Reply Lee Mastroddi says November 2 2015 at 807 am Noah Shnapp (not Schapps - maybe you can correct?) who does the voice of Charlie Brown can also currently be seen playing the son of Tom Hanks character in Bridge of Spies.

TWITTER The Peanuts gang amusingly reunite for their first feature-length animated adventure in 35 years. You did it Charlie Brown Going where many before him have stumbled and fallen Charles M. Schulzs iconic follicly-challenged underdog has made a notably smooth transition to computer-animated 3D with The Peanuts Movie a delightful romp that captures the spirit of the adored 65-year-old comic strip. Its evident from the very start--with Schroeder accompanying the Fox fanfare on his baby baby grand--that those who may have initially cried ""Good grief"" when the studio announced the upgrade three years ago could just sit back and relax. Well aware that they were dealing with precious cargo director Steve Martino previously credited with preserving the distinctly Seussian qualities of his 2008 adaptation of Horton Hears A Who and screenwriters Craig Schulz Bryan Schulz and Cornelius Uliano have similarly brought the Peanuts gang into the 21st century without betraying that crucial fondly nostalgic element. The thoroughly engaging result coinciding with the 50th anniversary of the first airing of A Charlie Brown Christmas should deservedly carry its good cheer well into the holiday season. Read More TV Ratings Charlie Browns Great Pumpkin Strong as Ever Ahead of Peanuts Box-Office Bow Technically the fifth feature-length Peanuts outing (the first was 1969s A Boy Named Charlie Brown) the film doesnt venture too far from home despite that larger canvas once again confining the action to the immediate neighborhood save for Snoopys fantasy air battles with arch-nemesis the Red Baron. Driving this particular collection of character vignettes is the arrival of the Little Red-Haired Girl with whom Charlie Brown (pitch-perfectly voiced by 10-year-old Noah Schnapp) is instantly and hopelessly smitten. All the touchstones are in play including CBs kite-flying challenges and Lucys counseling sessions (still 5 cents) as are all the main characters voiced for the most part by actual kids. The only bit of stunt-casting comes from the presence of Kristin Chenoweth as Snoopys love interest a femme-fatale flyer named Fifi; while the electronically modulated voice recordings of the late Bill Melendez have been incorporated for those Snoopy/Woodstock ""line readings."" Similar care has been notably taken with those 3D character renderings which manage to bring warmth into an often soul-less technology by retaining Schulzs deceptively simple remarkably expressive squiggles depicting eyebrows and smiles rather than attempting to go for deeper visual dimension. Read More Annecy Peanuts Director Steve Martino on Translating the Comic to CG-Animated Film That same respect for the past can be found in the script credited to Schulz son Craig and grandson Bryan along with the younger Schulzs writing partner Cornelius Uliano which still favors rotary telephones and manual typewriters although introducing blue recycling boxes into the mix. Also wisely retained are Vince Guaraldis jazzy themes performed here by David Benoit which mesh nicely with Christophe Becks original score. Only Meghan Trainors bouncy dance-pop contribution ""Better When Im Dancin"" feels a bit out of place in an otherwise caringly organic affectionately composed love letter to Charles Schulz.
