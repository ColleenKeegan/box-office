Living with her ailing mother (Ariadna Gil) evil stepfather (Sergei Lopez) and his compassionate housekeeper (Maribel Verdu) the girl steps into a netherland where the ancient satyr Pan (Doug Jones) gives her three tasks to complete so she can return to her true life as princess of the underworld.The images are visceral surreal bewildering unnerving. The drama is passionate profound tragic startling. Its a film of horrors and marvels the tone ranging from savage atrocity to divine benevolence the movie bursting with provocative ambiguity that provides the stuff of endless debate over the storys meaning and even its outcome.

The morning line of speculation from the critics had Pedro Almodovars Volver and Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritus Babel holding as the frontrunners with Nuri Bilge Ceylans Climates as an honorable compromise candidate. But we know nothing. All the awards are chosen by the nine-member Jury headed this year by Hong Kong auteur Wong Kar-wai and theyre not talking. So we trade rumors. The most piquant floated by one French insider had the Palme dOr going to the Portuguese film Colossal Youth. If so this would be the upset of the movie millennium. Varietys Justin Chang described the film as ""a numbing nearly three-hour fusion of documentary and dramatic essay that will hold the Portuguese directors coterie of fans in rapt attention while proving a colossal bore to everyone else."" Poor Justin was obliged to stay for the whole thing (actually 2hr.35min.). And truth to tell a few critics who put themselves through the entire ordeal whispered the word materpiece if only to annoy the rest of us -- because for most reviewers this static film about the Lisbon lower depths was literally un-sit-throughable at least after the first hour. If Costa does win expect a chorus of boos to drown out his acceptance speech. The other rumor was that Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie were planning to honor the country where their daughter was born by naming her Branamibia. For a quick report on the closing ceremony come on back here around 10p.m. Paris time 4p.m. EDT for a quick report on the winners. Meanwhile we wanted to tell you about two movies one thats among our favorites at this years festival Guillermo Del Toros Pans Labyrinth and another John Cameron Mitchells Shortbus that points more clearly than any recent film in a provocative direction the cinema could take. --Mary Corliss and Richard Corliss Alice and Malice Pans Labyrinth was shown Saturday the Festivals final day of competition. Thats the graveyard slot here. By the 11th day many of the Cannes conventioneers have departed and the Jury presumably has a good idea of their award preferences by then. For a last-day film to win the Palme dOr would be like a public access show at two in the morning copping the top spot in the Nielsen ratings. Well who cares? Pans Labyrinth is terrific. It sets an Alice in Wonderland fantasy in the desperate conflict of fascists and insurgents in Francos Spain 1944. An Army officer the brutal Capt. Vidal (Sergi Lopez) has married and impregnated a young widow (Araidna Gil) bringing her and her 11-year-old daughter Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) to a house in the rebel zone he is patrolling. Ofelia fiercely loyal to her mother and dead father and rightly suspicious of the Captain feels the force of strange creatures from the moment she arrives at her new home. While the adults career toward confrontation and tragedy the girl becomes immersed in the magic world in the surrounding forest. This sylvan realm is populated by stickbugs that morph into fairies a toad the size of a Studebaker and ruling them all a seven-foot-tall Pan the goat-god. He knows Ofelia as soon as she enters his underground home identifying her as the long-lost Princess Moanna. He tells her she will reach her destiny -- will ""stroll through the seven circular gardens of your palace"" -- if she can accomplish three difficult tasks. One is to get a key that the toad has swallowed. The second use that key to unlock a door in the lair of the Pale Man a child-devourer who has eyeballs in his hands. And the third Del Toro is known for the horror movies (Cronos Hellboy) that he has directed in Hollywood and his native Mexico. Theyre quite sophisticated but nothing in them prepared viewers for the narrative richness and emotional gravity of Pans Labyrinth -- Lewis Carroll meets Luis Bunuel. This is a fantasy realm so fully and elegantly realized it might be the adaptation of a classic novel. Yet the source is Del Toros own capacious imagination. The inverted logic of a childs dreams rarely has had such a secure equilibrium. And it is brilliantly visualized by Guillermo Navarros cinematography a severe symphony of dark shades in the house more dramatic color contrasts in the labyrinth. For much of the film Ofelias fairy-tale quest is secondary to the power vectors at work in the house. Tensions bubble between the Captain and Ofelias weak mother and especially the Captain and the housekeeper Mercedes (Maribel Verdu). These are two marvelous characters. She has a quiet ferocity to match her cunning which makes her a splendid revolutionary heroine. He is the real monster of the story with a sadism bred in him by his own soldier father and a macho theatricality that makes him a great movie villain. Lopez (who has played memorably creepy types in With a Friend Like Harry and Dirty Pretty Things) and Verdu (the sexy ""older woman"" in Y tu mama tambien but here sinewy and resolute) would both be worthy of Cannes acting prizes. Del Toro calls Pans Labyrinth a childs dark fantasy for adults. Certainly its not for children. Even the grown-up audience in Cannes was jolted by the Captains acts of violence towards others (he shoots a suspect in cold blood after smashing his face to pulp with a broken bottle) and himself. The scene in which after having his own cheek cut open he sutures a pretty severe gash in his mouth earned the audiences applause. Most ""adult"" is Del Toros belief that the world into which young minds soar or retreat is fragile indeed. The ending should not be revealed except to say Ive never encountered it in a childrens book nor movie. While Ofelia burrows into Pans labyrinth the world outside -- the real one -- plays by a harsher more violent set of rules. Learning the difference is the beginning of maturity the end of childhood innocence. --Mary Corliss Meet the ers Shortbus is a nice funny romantic comedy-drama about relationships among ""the gifted and challenged"" in post-9/11 New York City. It could slip comfily into any slot at the Sundance Film Festival except for one thing it has lots of explicit hard-core sex. The movie opens and climaxes if I can say that with the cross-cutting of several scenes of vigorous sexual activity. One heterosexual couple rushes through a dozen permutations in a wham-bam-Kama-Sutra fashion. A young man photographs his genitals in his bathtub. Another fellow performs acrobatic onanistic sex; he could start his own Cirque de Solo. A dominatrix whups her client while he tries to pursue the kind of conversational line other people might have on a first date. (He ""Are you a top or a bottom in real life?"" She ""This is real life."" He ""Let me put it another way Do you think we should get out of Iraq?"") Having met these seekers in their most intimate moments we soon get to know them better. Severin (Lindsay Beamish) the dominatrix cant get past the idea of sex as a power struggle expressed in theatrical terms. The bathtub guy Jamie (PJ DeBoy) and the contortionist James (Paul Dawson) have been a couiple for a few years. Now they want to expand and experiment. As James observes dismissively""Monogamy is for straight people."" As for Sofia (Soon-yin Lee) half of the heterosexual pair she feels constrained in her marriage to Rob (Raphael Barker). No wonder there one day she discovers Rob pleasuring himself while perusing a porn website. ""Im looking for a job"" he explains lamely. ""What"" she asks ""a hand job?"" But Sofia has her own problems shes a sex therapist who gets no ultimate kick from sex. When James and Jamie come to her as patients she turns the tables by confessing to them ""Im pre-orgasmic."" ""Does that mean youre about to have one?"" ""No. It means Ive never had one."" For short-term solutions to their problems they all go to a sex cabaret called Shortbus. Among the denizens are a courtly older gent who bears a passing resemblance to a former bachelor mayor of New York and the cabarets host real-life male diva Justin Bond. ""Its just like the 60s"" he says of the entanglement of bodies in the orgy room ""only with less hope."" The search for connection might seem exclusively sexual but to Justin its all about style. He quotes one Lotus Weinstein as saying ""I used to want to change the world. Now I just want to leave the room with a little dignity."" Theres more sex in the movie including a three-way gay routine that features a rendition of ""The Star Spangled Banner"" sung in very close quarters. (It still sounds better than Rosannes version.) But Mitchell has little interest in being the avatar of those triple-X pioneers the Mitchell Brothers of Behind the Green Door infamy. This Mitchell was the author lyricist and star of the off-Broadway hit Hedwig and the Angry Inch. Here his structuring of the material is less like a hard-core film more like a musical. There are songs throughout though Mitchell didnt write them and the production numbers have a geometrical elegance and absurdity that suggests a porno Busby Berkeley. And when the movie finally ends (it has more tie-up-the-plot scenes than The Lord of the Rings The Return of the King) everybodys back at the salon singing the anthemic ""We All Get It in the End."" Im not saying Shortbus is a world-beater; its mostly clever sometimes meandering. And I have to say I didnt get excited by all the gay exertions (or the straight ones). But I hail Mitchell for achieving something that was on many a serious directors mind 30 years ago the coherent integration of explicit sex scenes into a naturalistic story film. Mitchell said that in press interviews here he was asked over and over ""Why sex?"" I wonder What took so long? Most people laugh and cry; most people have sex occasionally at the same time. Sex isnt divorced from our own emotional biographies; its an inextricable part of it. So I applaud Mitchell. And I say to other intrepid filmmakers Just do it. The night after the out-of-competition Cannes screening Shortbus threw itself a party on the Martinez Hotel beach. The press was told there would be performances. I cant imagine what we expected to find. A gamier version of Meet the Fokkers I guess. But no. various members of the cast convened for a concert. The vibe was like an American Idol audition on Avenue A. A little raunchy but essentially convivial. As Mary C. noted ""Its a dorm party not a porn party."" It took place in a bandshell at the end of the pier that stretches into the Mediterranean. As I looked down I noticed quite a bit of unattractive flotsam in the water. The sea was dirtier than the show. The host was Justin Bond backed by the piano stylings of Kenny Melman. He kept the event afloat with his lithe sarcasm. (""If I could love"" he told one singer ""I would love you very much."") But the 500 or so attendees standing on that pier really came to life when Mitchell bounded onstage singing forcefully dancing with a practiced frenzy showing the audience and the other performers what stage presence really is. Around 1 a.m. Mitchell asked the crowd to join in on the final number and we did. Mary swayed; I swayed. Next to me there was Sofia Coppola swaying with a friend and singing along to ""We All Get It in the End."" It was a lovely communal moment for we were moved by a spirit both erotic and innocent. Just like the 60s you might say only with less hype. --Richard Corliss Next The Da Vinci Code Mystery Revealed gt;gt; Home U.S. Politics World Business Tech Health Science Entertainment Newsfeed Living Ideas Parents Sports History The TIME Vault Magazine Subscribe Give a Gift TIME Shop Newsletters Customer Service Site Map Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights Terms of Use Advertising Ad Choices (c) 2016 Time Inc.

Ofelia and her beautiful bedridden mother (Ariadna Gil) are locked away in her new dads (a loathsome Sergi Lopez) secluded military outpost which to the left has an ancient maze and in the hills is surrounded by freedom fighters whom Papa eagerly scalps and tortures. When some carnivorous fairies appear and lure the girl away to do the icky bidding of the faun of the underworld (Doug Jones) Ofelia reckons it cant be worse than watching men get fatally bashed in the head by their own whiskey flasks and so she pluckily sets about crawling into roach-infested trees and running from child-eating ghouls. Though Ofelias smock is swiped from Alice her faun from Narnia her magic book from Harry Potter and her family tree from the Brothers Grimm Del Toro sets her fairytale apart with its unrelenting gore and misery. There could be black magic here if Baqueros leading heroine wasnt as wooden as the sorcerers broomstick; instead she sets about her chores with all the wonder and spark of an automaton. Meanwhile Daddy Dearest is taking pliers and knives to the rebels who dare to hope for happiness. What lingers isnt fantasy but Del Toros gorgeous despair that leaves you rushing home to stick your head not in the magic closet but in the oven. 0 Comments Be the first to comment You must be logged in to post a comment.

Rather than endure the brutality of her wicked stepfather a captain serving Francos harsh dictatorship Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) retreats to a magical realm where she learns to resist any who would intimidate her. Her netherworld is a carnival mirror image of the political horrors she witnesses. In this split-level narrative as Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez) snuffs out the underground resistance from his garrison near an abandoned mill Ofelia repairs to her subterranean realm where menacing creatures threaten. Fantasy is the sword with which this supremely poised innocent battles - and transcends - the forces of evil. Pans Labyrinth the extraordinary film from Mexican fabulist Guillermo del Toro is as poetic as a ballad and as primal as a myth - imagine The Chronicles of Narnia painted by a tag team of Goya and Dali. Del Toro is a conjurer who employs realism to intensify his fantasy - and vice versa. This is the breakthrough work of one of world cinemas most visionary artists. The film opens near the woods in northern Spain in 1944. The images introduce us to the real Ofelia as the narration tells of a mythical princess who has fled her kingdom abandoning a father who longs for her return. Ofelia bridges these separate realities. There is her terrestrial responsibility as a child who has lost her father and accompanies her pregnant mother to her stepfathers military outpost. And there is her subterranean supernatural adventure as the fatherless innocent whose quest is to resurrect the dead parent. Baqueros Ofelia bravely navigates both worlds armed by an accommodating dragonfly and an enchanted book. She looks perfectly capable of catching a falling star as the John Donne poem goes and getting with child a mandrake root. A mandrake which very much resembles an embryo plays a significant role in the story. Those familiar with the work of del Toro perhaps best known as the Hellboy horrormeister will not be disappointed with his tableau of gothic ruins where gargoyles spring to life as bizarre fauns and frogs. Because del Toro weds his grotesques to a story of enchantment - they are not there to scare you but to test Ofelias mettle - those with low thresholds for gore wont have to avert their eyes too often. More unsettling than the films imagery is its sound. Things dont just go bump in the night but gurgle and rustle and thud in ways that make your heart crack. Ofelia encounters many fearsome creatures on her quest. A vaguely lecherous faun. A loathsome toad big as Jabba the Hut of Star Wars fame swimming in his own slime. A mummy man with a featureless face and eyes hidden in the palms of his hands. (The production design by Eugenio Caballero is as evocative and pungent as that in Jean Cocteaus classic Beauty and the Beast.) But none of these ragged bogeymen is as intimidating or imposing as her stepfather immaculate in his gabardine uniform and leather gloves dedicated to ""cleansing"" Spain of the remaining Republicans opposing Francos regime. His contempt for stepdaughter and spouse is palpable; Vidal cares only for the child swelling in his wifes belly. And when he sees that Ofelia is his rival for this infant - the hope of future Spain - he treats her like an insurgent. Ofelias one ally is Mercedes (Maribel Verdu) the housekeeper who like the young girl lives a double life. The key to the narrative is . . . a key. In Vidals garrison it unlocks the warehouse where life-sustaining food and medicine are stored. In Ofelias underground caverns it unlocks the corridors of power. The motif of the key ties the two narrative strands into a knot placing Ofelia at the literal and metaphorical crossroads. She holds the key to whether Spain will fall to Fascism or rise with Republicanism. The films resolution is as ambiguous and rich as its narrative. I leave it to others to debate whether Pans Labyrinth ends on a note of triumph or tragedy - or both. What I do know for certain is that del Toro has created a timeless story. Finally Pans Labyrinth suggests that fairy-tale violence helps the vulnerable process and overcome real-life conflicts and that real-life violence permanently smashes the soul and the heart. By the end I rode the emotional waves of elation and elegy and thought once again of Donne of ""Death Be Not Proud"" of the poets hope that death shall be no more. ""Death thou shalt die.""

"Captivating Worlds washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Captivating Worlds Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) pays a visit to a child-eating ogre (Doug Jones) whos no less ominous than the forces of totalitarianism around her in 1940s Spain. (By Teresa Isasi -- Picturehouse) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday January 12 2007 Every now and then a movie comes along that is so extraordinary -- so breathtaking in its artistic ambition so technically accomplished so morally expansive so fully realized -- that it defies the usual critical blather. Just see it you want to tell readers. See it and celebrate that rare occasion when a director has the audacity to commit cinema. Such is the case with ""Pans Labyrinth"" Guillermo Del Toros visionary parable that would mark the zenith of the 42-year-old filmmakers career were he not still so young. A visually dazzling fairy tale set in Franco-era Spain this meditation on the costs and limits of totalitarianism combines the Gothic fantasy that has been Del Toros signature -- from his debut ""Cronos"" through comic book adaptations such as ""Blade II"" and ""Hellboy"" -- with the themes and setting of his 2001 historical drama ""The Devils Backbone."" With ""Pans Labyrinth"" Del Toro seems to have created his manifesto a tour de force of cautionary zeal humanism and magic. At this writing ""Pans Labyrinth"" is the best-reviewed film of 2006 listed on the movie review Web site http//metacritic.com/ and for a reason Its just that great. But enough critical blather. Its 1944 the fascists have won Spains brutal civil war and a young girl named Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is traveling with her mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil) to live with her new stepfather a Nationalist army captain named Vidal (Sergi Lopez). When Ofelia arrives at her new home -- an abandoned mill on the edge of a forest that still shelters Republican guerrillas -- it becomes clear that she matters little to Vidal who is more concerned that the baby her mother is carrying turn out to be the son he has always coveted. Ofelia increasingly takes refuge from the brutality of her surroundings in a richly imagined fantasy life one that eventually leads her to a faun living in the titular labyrinth on Vidals property. Meanwhile Vidals housekeeper Mercedes (Maribel Verdu) is covertly helping the rebels in the woods and befriends the young girl who in creating an increasingly elaborate and highly charged private world isnt retreating from reality as much as resisting it. Like all great fairy tales ""Pans Labyrinth"" features a girl on the cusp of womanhood who embarks on a quest-journey; when she meets the faun -- a fantastical creature played by Doug Jones with the help of prosthetics puppeteers and computer animation -- he charges her with completing three tasks in order to prove that shes worthy of the supernatural company shes keeping. By far the most memorable of the fauns challenges is Ofelias visit to a hideous ogre at a sumptuous banquet where the girl is not allowed to eat. The ogre -- also portrayed by Jones -- is a grotesque brilliantly conceived creation a deliquescent wraith who sees with eyes set in the palms of his hands. The effect when he raises those limbs to gaze at the girl is every bit as shocking and haunting as anything by Hieronymus Bosch. With its painterly palette (Del Toro once again works with cinematographer Guillermo Navarro) and densely detailed production design ""Pans Labyrinth"" evokes great works in any number of artistic mediums from the paintings of Goya and Balthus to the films of Luis Bunuel and Dario Argento. (Del Toro seems to be quoting Bunuel not to mention himself in an excruciating scene where Vidal stitches up his own sliced face.) The director has always been a special-effects wizard -- he started out as a makeup technician -- but here he outstrips his own prodigious achievements creating a menagerie of creatures and settings that are by turns poetic terrifying and amusing but all unforgettable. Its in its sophisticated politics that ""Pans Labyrinth"" qualifies as Del Toros most mature work; he depicts fascism not just as a failed political or philosophical system (taking well-aimed swipes at clerical complicity along the way) but primarily as the failure of imagination. As Ofelia makes her quiet and courageous way through the fauns to-do list -- while the sentient world around her falls apart -- her own imagination her willingness to surrender to her own creative subconscious becomes the means not just of escape but of survival. True to its title ""Pans Labyrinth"" pans effortlessly between the natural world Ofelias fantasies and Vidals rustic redoubt investing each with a share of enchantment and menace. But although Del Toros visual imagery whether beguiling or brutal is always dazzling the heart of the movie lies in the extraordinary relationship between Ofelia and her otherworldly muse. Seductive prickly demanding and mercurial the faun is an ambiguous creature his motives never neatly billboarded; Del Toro deliberately keeps filmgoers off balance when it comes to this complicated satyr who goes from puckish to sinister in the blink of a milky eye. As the audiences guide through this often confounding world Ofelia deserves a place alongside Alice in Wonderland and Dorothy Gale as one of the great young heroines of classic myth and the 12-year-old Baquero inhabits her with rare solemnity equanimity and moral strength. There are so many indelible images here the transformation of an insect into a fairy; an enormous toad who drips with sticky icky authenticity; a wounded fighter taking one last look at his leg. Seamlessly moving from myth to reality Del Toro creates a world that is of a piece with life as it is lived and in dreams. And unlike so many recent films that have trafficked in fantasy from Middle Earth to Narnia ""Pans Labyrinth"" creates a visual lexicon that is at once familiar and brand new drenched in the realities of milk honey and blood but plunging into our deep even perverse anxieties for its darkest imagery. Most heroically Del Toro subverts the traditional happy ending audiences have come to expect from their fairy tales. Instead he gives the fearless steadfast Ofelia her due until the bitter end. By the time she faces her last challenge in the shattering conclusion of ""Pans Labyrinth"" audiences will care deeply about a girl whos come to represent not just political dissent but life itself. Del Toro never flinches and the final sequence while both healing and tragic is finally a triumph of uncompromising vision. Pans Labyrinth (112 minutes in Spanish with subtitles at area theaters) is rated R for graphic violence and some profanity.

"`Pan is magic and tragic - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Labyrinth `Pan is magic and tragicmovies - reviewGuillermo del Toro aims high and hits the mark in his moving affecting fantasyJanuary 19 2007|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie CriticFantasy films dont often have the ambition to be historic allegories but Pans Labyrinth does. A violent fantasy set during the Spanish Civil War this magical film from Guillermo del Toro (Mimic) manages that intellectual high-mindedness even as it resonates on a primal mythic level.A Mexican writer-director del Toro knows his Spanish history. But he also knows his Joseph Campbell and his Vladimir Propp. This story of a young girl who escapes into a dangerous world of fairies and beasts has Campbells Hero With a Thousand Faces tests magic talismans moments of failure and heartfelt triumphs. It is a film cooked up with many a classic folktales required ingredients as described long ago by Propp a story analyst from Russia.Pans Labyrinth is a stunning blend of the magically surreal with the graphically real. It contrasts the real horrors of the Spanish Civil War -- torture atrocities murder and combat -- with the fantasy terrors and rewards of an enchanted labyrinth.Thats what impressionable Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) who is about 10 finds upon arriving at the new posting of her bloody-minded stepfather (Sergi Lopez) a sadistic captain in the fascist army sent to put down the rebels in this wooded corner of Spain. Ofelia reads her fairy tales and tries to comfort her weak pregnant mother (Ariadna Gil). But on arriving at the old mill where they are now to live she spies fairies. She soon meets Pan who charms her and tells her she is the queen whom they have been awaiting in his enchanted ancient labyrinth.Ofelia to take the throne has to prove herself. Every night she is given a task. Some quests she passes. Some she fails.The magic spills over into her daily life where she must protect her mother and unborn brother from the monster Mom has married. The Captain personally extracts confessions from suspected partisans. He personally executes them. He seems to enjoy it. Ofelia tries to use the magic she has discovered to protect herself her mother and her sibling-to-be.Del Toro has a zest for fantasy and unflinching horror (Hellboy The Devils Backbone). Here for all the faceless ghouls and gargantuan toads that Ofelia faces at night the reality of her days that he conjures up is much worse. Life in a combat zone is not pretty.Mercedes (Maribel Verdu) the housekeeper struggles to hide her partisan loyalties from the killer captain and to save Ofelia from her father made terrifyingly real and cruel by Lopez. Lopez makes the man so evil he would twirl his moustache if he had one.Its a story of stark simplicity. Every third-act climax is foreshadowed by a first-act explanation. Why are this mother and daughter here?""Because a son should be born where his father is"" the captain spits.Why dont the rebels and their sympathizers give up? All the captain wants is loyalty a willingness to follow orders even from his doctor.""But captain to obey for obeys sake . . . thats something only people like you do.""Lyrically written affectingly acted and poetically filmed Pans Labyrinth in Spanish with English subtitles is brilliant enough to lift an entire genre simply by its presence. It is one of the most acclaimed films of 2006 and justly so.And Baquero as the heroine written into a tale that dates from when time began touches us with her humanity her pluck and her hope that somewhere deep down we all have what it takes to navigate this labyrinth the world hurls us into.

Mexican director Guillermo Del Toro exercises his gift with fantasy to tell a fabulist saga in which horror is all too human and fantastical beings might provide if not a cure at least some way to combat the evil. The writer-director of ""Hellboy"" and ""The Devils Backbone"" (in Spanish 2001) fulfills a fundamental requirement of movies that rely on an overflowing bag of tricks from advanced puppetry to CGI to prosthetics He makes those gestures integral to the story. They beguile but do not insist they are the reason for the movie. So when young Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) faces a morbidly huge toad while searching for a key in the innards of a tree the scene is at once icky scary and fascinating. And when Ofelia follows a dragonfly fairy to the lair where the magnificent faun Pan lives the scene carries the rush of the new and the comforting aura of the ancient. We rush ahead. Once upon a time shortly after Francisco Francos Nationalists seized Spain a dark-haired lonely child named Ofelia traveled north with her pregnant mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil). At an outpost her wicked stepfather Capt. Vidal was doing all in his power to destroy the resistance fighters waging battle from the mountains nearby. Sergi Lopez does a disquieting job making Vidal believable and monstrous. In what might be a wink toward ""Pulp Fiction"" Del Toro gives the pent-up captain an obsession with a timepiece. Vidals own father a great soldier was said to have broken his pocket watch at the moment of his death so his son would know his heroism. Gleaning the shriveled root of Vidals pathology will not aid you in forgiving his many cruelties. In showing them Del Toro doesnt exploit. But you might shudder and cover your eyes. This fable earns its R rating. From the chilly moment Vidal greets Ofelia we know he has no use for this girl. His focus and faith are on the unborn child Carmen carries. A son Vidals certain of it. Fathers and patriarchy shape the rough terrain Ofelia traverses. Her own father a tailor died some years back. Her sweet mom doesnt provide much of an alternative. In a moment of mother-child confidence she tries to break the hold fables have on her daughters imagination with a lesson in adult compromise. Its not an appealing trade. Del Toro loves this little girl and provides her guides. At the outpost theres Mercedes who works in the captains house. The impressive Maribel Verdu played the older woman to the randy teens in ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" by Alfonso Cuaron an executive producer here. As Carmen grows weaker in her difficult pregnancy Mercedes offers Ofelia some strength. She might even find backbone to take on the devil. Above all there is Pan. Beneath prosthetics and hours of makeup Doug Jones (""Hellboy"") captures this satyrs complicated charms. Possessing a tricksters way with language he comforts but also taunts and challenges. Like the ""great and powerful"" and blustery wizard of a certain Emerald City Pan is fond of meting out the difficult task seemingly meant to trip up our young heroine. One leads her into the company of a spectacularly unnerving grostesque whose eyes are in the palms of his hands. Ivana Baquero was 11 at the time Del Toro cast her as Ofelia. On her slim shoulders the director placed a remarkable responsibility. But with apologies and gratitude to Simon amp; Garfunkel we can say of the wee wondrous heroine Ofelia you break our hearts. But you also restore our confidence in human decency.

Guillermo del Toros nightmare fable is an achievement but not one intended for small children. Its imagery is far too upsetting. For everyone else this picture is required viewing. Set in Francos Spain just after the civil war the story is told through the eyes of 13-year-old Ofelia whose beautiful but sickly mother has married a vicious Fascist captain. To escape her life Ofelia imagines an underground cavern filled with satyrs ogres and trolls. In tone ""Pans Labyrinth"" resembles a cross between ""Alice in Wonderland"" and H.P. Lovecraft with some Bunuel thrown in for good measure. Its a tribute to - as well as a prime example of - the disturbing power of imagination.

A few years ago he worked the raw materials of Nazis and demons into the formulaic shamelessly entertaining comic-book adventure ""Hellboy."" Now he has tapped the same ingredients for a serious art film that is at once deeply personal and touchingly universal.""Pans Labyrinth"" uses the final days of the Spanish Civil War as the nightmarish backdrop for a fable involving an evil step-parent occult beings and a heroic innocent child. The Fascist forces are exterminating the final remnants of the resistance in the countryside and Capt. Vidal the new adoptive father of 11-year-old Ofelia is one of the governments most merciless brutes. His callous treatment of Ofelias ailing pregnant mother is the mildest manifestation of his cruelty.If Vidal is the daytime face of infernal forces Ofelias dreamlike adventures among the fabulous creatures of the forest represent its nighttime opposite. Wandering the grounds near the old mill house where Vidal has relocated the family Ofelia encounters fairies an underground netherworld and its towering horn-headed lord the faun Pan. The ugly creature is suspect sometimes expressing concern for Ofelia calling himself ""your most humble servant"" sometimes harsh or deviously manipulating. He tells her she is a reincarnated princess of the underworld and that if she completes three dangerous quests she will regain her powers; with no other options to escape her painful life she agrees. She must believe. Hes all she has.Del Toro links Pans dark brooding magical realm to the sunny real world creating a story that can be understood from several points of view. Ofelia might be taking refuge in her imagination. Pan may exist but his promises could be lies. Or the frightening creature may really be Ofelias guardian spirit. The film retains its enticing ambiguity until the final shot a scene as heart-wrenching as anything in the original unfiltered Brothers Grimm. Del Toro understands that the correct cathartic and emotionally satisfying ending to a fairy tale isnt necessarily a happy one.""Pans Labyrinth"" is beautifully shot and designed but its the acting that makes it a remarkable emotional journey. Talented mime artist Doug Jones plays Pan so compellingly that you lose sight of the prosthetic limbs and demonoid makeup that have transformed him into a demigod. Its Pans mercurial nature rather than his grotesque form that rivets your attention. Hes an Alice-through-the-looking-glass reflection of the malicious and arbitrary Capt. Vidal a childs conception of unfathomable alien adult power.Of course the films success hangs on its brave suffering heroine and Ivana Baquero plays the lead impeccably offering the kind of textured imaginative performance seen in the best work by the young Jodie Foster or Dakota Fanning. Even when the story is deep in the realm of the fantastic she remains rivetingly realistic.

"A girl a maze and a monster - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW A girl a maze and a monster In masterful Labyrinth history comes alive By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  January 12 2007 I spent most of ""Pans Labyrinth"" reassembling the pieces of my shattered impression of Guillermo del Toro. While his earlier movies had whiffs of soul they looked like classic horror pictures -- the vampire flicks ""Cronos"" and ""Blade II"" -- or overcooked science fiction like 1996s ""Mimic"" with Mira Sorvino and its giant subway-dwelling bugs. Then there was ""Hellboy"" with its whooshing action sequences and winking wit. The Mexican director was a cult taste with a cultish following -- hes won the fealty of the pimpled thickly bespectacled and clannishly obsessed. As it turns out the geeks were on to something. ""Pans Labyrinth"" is a transcendent work of art. Del Toros gratifying surreal and fantastical instincts now have an unstinting moral eye on the world. Saying a filmmaker has matured suggests that hes forgone what made him so entertaining in the first place. But in evolving with this voluptuously realized film with its omnipresent dangers Del Toro has simply refined the deftness of his storytelling. A beautiful film about ugliness ""Pans Labyrinth"" is still pure del Toro (the insects and slime for instance are still here) but he gazes through a grim historical lens.Set in 1944 after the Spanish Civil War just as Franco begins his terrible domination this fractured fairy tale introduces us to a girl named Ofelia (Ivana Baquero ) whose father died in the Spanish Civil War and whose sickly mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil ) has recently wed the nasty fascist Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez ). Mother and daughter have moved to the captains military outpost an old mill whose wooded outskirts crawl with guerrillas and within which is hidden a rocky labyrinth. One evening following a dragonfly Ofelia makes her way inside the maze down a spiraling stairway and into the netherworld of a hissy faun (Doug Jones ). He convinces her that shes an escaped princess come home and through a magical book filled with calligraphy and Rorschach blots begins assigning her physical challenges -- sneaking inside trees or hoisting herself into her dingy bedroom through the floor.The book whose designs were sketched by del Toro  becomes a kind of instruction manual whose demands keep her busy above ground and below. It turns out that the faun is as forbidding as her stepfather. Some girls get a secret garden Narnia Wonderland or Oz. Poor Ofelia has to settle for her increasingly difficult straits.Del Toro masterfully intercuts Ofelias quests with scenes of the guerrillas who hide in the hills and launch random attacks. The men survive with the surreptitious dedication of the captains physician (Alex Angulo ) and his formidable housekeeper Mercedes (Maribel Verdu  the beauty from ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" whos fantastic here). At the mill and in the hills grisliness persists. In so many ways ""Pan s Labyrinth"" is about pain real human pain.Del Toro inhabits almost exactly the same territory as 2001s anti fascist ghost story ""The Devils Backbone"" before the fall of the Catalans in the civil war. A political sensibility suffused the supernaturalism but the film ultimately was about the predominance of phantasms the vague specters of history. The new movies clarity of vision is far more robust making similar ghosts flesh and blood.History is as alive and unquenchable as the faun and the captain  with their affronts on a girl who must learn to act independent ly of the state -- both the dream state and the fascist state. The brilliance of Lopezs performance is how he conflates the two giving us a monster with a seductively human face but never too human.Del Toros film belongs on a double bill with Victor Erices ""Spirit of the Beehive"" another more elliptical film set in Franco - era Spain and focused on the active imaginary lives of innocents. ""Pan s Labyrinth"" questions the limits of fantasy how complete devotion to allegory can be blinding. What will fans of ""Blade II"" and ""Hellboy"" make of this about - face?Del Toro is still interested in the physical surrealism of David Cronenberg and the social critiques of Luis Bunuel. But unlike say fellow fantasist Tim Burton whose movies can prize the saccharine while peddling bogus pathos Del Toro has made a film rich in both visual audacity and moral consequence. ""Pans Labyrinth"" is a feat of unique cinematic alchemy A master of horror-movie schlock has made a stunningmagic-realist masterpiece.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Ivana Baquero left and Doug Jones star in Pans Labyrinth. Photo Picturehouse Pans Labyrinth 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Disney might tell us otherwise but children understand the menace that lurks in a fairy tale. Ghouls hide under floorboards. Grown-ups hold murder in their hearts. Forests murmur with secrets and a dangerous shimmering witchcraft that demands the blood of innocents. Guns knives torture deadly pursuits under moonlight -- these are the grim imaginings of Pans Labyrinth Guillermo del Toros dark exploration of brutality and the underworld that sees both in the plight of a fatherless 12-year-old girl. Shes named Ofelia and shes played by Ivana Baquero -- a young Spaniard with the brunet bob and sweet damp eyes of Anne Frank. The resemblance might be intended or not but it resonates with meaning. For Ofelia is a child gasping for freedom in a time (1944) and place (Spain) oppressed by tyranny. Its the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War but Republicans fight on in the hills where government forces are trying to quash the last of the rebellion. Ofelia and her pregnant mother (Ariadna Gil) have journeyed to a rural army outpost to join her new stepfather Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez) a man of barbarous cruelty and a watchmakers fussy precision. Outside her new home Ofelia finds a mysterious stone labyrinth crumbling and mossy and gnarled with roots. ""Its just a pile of rocks that has always been here"" says Mercedes (Maribel Verdu) a kind housekeeper. Ofelia learns otherwise when a fairy lures her into the maze and down down down spiral steps into a clammy chamber occupied by a faun. He is a daunting creature horned and loamy with wide-set eyes as blanched as a huskys. But hes nothing next to the horrors Ofelia encounters in her quest to perform three assigned tasks before the next full moon. If she succeeds she will return to the underworld as a long-lost princess. If she fails shes fated to live a mortal life fraught with sadness. Ofelia strikes out on her fantastical mission facing down a slime-puking frog and a bald bipedal monstrosity with eyes in the palms of his hands. The bald guy like Pan is played by Doug Jones otherwise known as Abe Sapien in del Toros Hellboy. As he did in that film and The Devils Backbone the director uses fascism to explore the blackest nightmares of the human mind. Unlike most of us who recall our youths with moist nostalgia he remembers the horror of it -- the incubus in the bedroom the distant groans inside a creaking house. Few periods in life are as terrifying as childhood. But Ofelias life holds more terrors than most as she copes with a sick mother a ruthless stepfather and battles that rage in the woods. The demon under the floor has nothing on the slicked-back Capitan who kills and maims with relish and pounds a mans face in with a bottle. Del Toros film traverses the juvenile imagination but that doesnt make it suitable for children Its often savagely violent sometimes to the point of gaping overkill. (Watch or not as a character sews up his own face after its been filleted into a jokers grin.) Pans Labyrinth plays with dark magic a hideous enchantment spun with grief and torment. It is emotionally devastating and sensuously rich Details are as sharp as the ching of a straight-edge razor as strange as the squeal of a magic root. Del Toro enters Ofelias world with eyes wide open his vision delirious with fear. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals SanDisk 128GB Cruzer Glide USB Flash Drive for 20 + pickup at...

Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Pans Labyrinth"" with Sergi Lpez Maribel Verd Ivana Baquero Ariadna Gil Alex Angulo Doug Jones. Written and directed by Guillermo del Toro. 112 minutes. Rated R for graphic violence and some language. In Spanish with English subtitles. Several theaters. Asked by a child if she believes in fairies a weary-eyed housekeeper (Maribel Verdu) says that she doesnt anymore but that she did when she was younger. Back then she says ""I believed in a lot of things I dont believe anymore."" Guillermo del Toros dark beautiful and mesmerizing ""Pans Labyrinth"" set in 1940s Spain but framed by a fantasy world far less specific is about fairies and monsters childhood innocence and adult disillusion the intricate curlicues of fantasy creatures and the harsh glint in the eye of a villain all too real. At its center is a book-loving child on the brink of adolescence young enough to believe in fairies old enough to have begun to fear the dangers of the real world. Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) lost her father a few years ago in the Spanish Civil War. Now with the war over but resistance continuing she moves to a remote military outpost with her fragile mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil speaking in the softest of whispers) who has married a military captain (Sergi Lopez standing chillingly erect). He greets Ofelia with a handshake devoid of warmth; in his black gloves his large hand snatches her tiny one as if catching it in a trap. As the captain and his fascist troops viciously dispose of rebels in the region -- and as it becomes clear that his only interest in Carmen and Ofelia has to do with the child Carmen will soon bear -- Ofelia enters her own world of good and evil. Enticed by a whimsical stick insect (""Are you a fairy?"" Ofelia asks it) she descends into a decrepit mossy labyrinth and is greeted by a horned creature the faun Pan (Doug Jones). He calls her a princess and assigns her tasks to prove her worth. In the dim blue light he gives her a book on whose blank pages will be written her future. Ofelias fairy-tale world (except in a brief late sequence) is no prettier than her real-life surroundings Shes chased by a horrifying fleshy monster whose eyes are in its hands (also played by Jones); spat at by a giant toad; crawled upon by slimy bugs. As danger closes in on her in the gray-blue underworld the same happens above ground as her one sense of security -- her mother -- becomes weaker. Begging her unborn brother not to hurt Carmen Ofelia touchingly promises to take him to her kingdom and make him a prince to remove him from the ugliness into which he will be born. Her mother from her sickbed urges her not to put her faith in fairy tales telling her that the world is a cruel place. But as Ofelia finds refuge in her imagination so do we in del Toros The dark violence of the film (parents note ""Pans Labyrinth"" is not for children) is leavened by its invention -- by the way it pushes the limits of reality and fantasy each world overlapping with the other. The stick-insect fairy floats like an inky firefly above the bed Ofelia shares with Carmen; its both intruder and guardian. In her own way Ofelia is at war taking arms against the evil she has found in the eyes of the captain. Her weapon is not a gun but a book a belief and a pure heart. ""Create your own door"" the faun tells Ofelia and she does. Baquero in a quiet and beautifully controlled performance (we see just one naughty smile hinting that this girl once knew happier times) creates a memorable heroine a small warrior determined to find her escape. Del Toro (""The Devils Backbone"" ""Hellboy"") has crafted a triumph of creativity and storytelling a film that continues to reveal its intricate layers in multiple viewings. ""Pans Labyrinth"" a fairy tale entangled by the darkest of vines haunts its watchers the way a bedtime story stays with a child long after the lights have gone out.

"Pans Labyrinth Astonishing fairy tale for adults - EastBayTimes.com Hot Topics Big Sur fire No-parachute skydive Deadline 29 to Vegas Sheryl Sandbergs Option B Chandra Levy Steve Torrence Ask Amy Comics SV150 Print Email Font ResizeEast Bay and Bay Area NewsPans Labyrinth Astonishing fairy tale for adultsBy Bruce Newman MEDIANEWS STAFFPosted 01/12/2007 024633 AM PSTUpdated 01/12/2007 110617 AM PST HERES LOOKING AT YOU KID The character known as The Pale Man (Doug Jones) has his hands full frightening the little girl who wanders into his digs in the Spanish-language ""Pans Labyrinth."" MGM RELEASED ""The Wizard of Oz"" in 1939 just as an official armistice was being declared in the Spanish Civil War. Armed resistance to the fascist government continued for years in Spain (it melted more quickly in Oz) and at the outset of Guillermo del Toros astonishing adult fairy tale ""Pans Labyrinth"" a girl of about the same age and dreamy disposition as Dorothy Gale is being swept toward a similarly fantastical kingdom. En route to her new home at a remote military outpost Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) clutches an armload of books containing her favorite fairy stories despite her mothers wish that she would leave such childish tales behind. Ofelias mother (Adriadna Gil of ""Belle Epoque"") is pregnant with the child of the garrisons fearsome commander Capt. Vidal (Sergi Lopez) and when the car in which they are riding pulls to the side of the road so she can be sick Ofelia wanders into the emerald forest that envelops this film. Seeing an insect with large whirring wings she decides that it is a fairy. The creature doesnt look like Tinkerbell or any other movie fairy weve seen before. It looks like a dragonfly; literalists may even believe thats what it is. But through Ofelias open eyes we are granted passage into del Toros fantasy world which looks like no other. The creator of such pulp prodigies as ""Hellboy"" and ""Blade II"" del Toro mingles myth and history in ""Pans Labyrinth"" and produces a masterpiece of magical realism.Advertisement However much this may resemble a full-dress fairy tale its not meant for children and the violence is so harrowing at times that it may even make some adults look away. Thats actually a tribute to the intensity of del Toros filmmaking and to the vitality of the characters he has written. The giant faun who comes to visit Ofelia (Doug Jones who has already played a cockroach for del Toro in ""Mimic"" and Abe Sapien in ""Hellboy"") is so believably an emissary of the under world in this waking dream that he makes Narnias Mr. Tumnus look like an aluminum siding salesman. Set in the same year as the early scenes of Clint Eastwoods ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" the battlefield of ""Pans Labyrinth"" is an Iberian Oz that feels impossibly remote from the war in the Pacific. Eastwood looks at good and evil from two different directions in ""Flags of Our Fathers"" and ""Letters"" but del Toro sees good and evil as conditions that exist side by side in different worlds on separate planes -- one above ground the other below. The pain in Spain stays mainly on the plane we know where the cruelty of monsters like Vidal is all too real. When Ofelia arrives at the military camp she offers Vidal her left hand to shake and as a corrective he crushes her fingers. But not her spirit. Eager to get away from her new stepfather she follows the fairy into a crumbling stone labyrinth where soon she encounters a faun as massive and menacing as the fascist captain. The faun calls her ""Your Highness"" and explains that she is the displaced royalty of a subterranean kingdom -- a world of frogs fairies and one ectoplasmic foodie whose taste is all in his mouth and whose eyeballs are all in the palms of his hands. To the extent that ""Pans Labyrinth"" is also part political fable the curtseying compliance of Ofelias mother to Vidal whose only interest in her is as breeding stock seems to represent Spains decades-long tolerance of the fascist Franco. Ofelias interests are looked after by Mercedes the posts housekeeper (Maribel Verdu the sexpot in ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" looking very different here) who is herself a kind of labyrinth the mysterious link between the movies two worlds. Lopez the Spanish actor whose only performances widely seen in this country were in ""Dirty Pretty Things"" and ""With Friends Like Harry"" turns Vidal into a dreadnaught of evil and paranoia. As an enemy he is without remorse; as a stepfather he is without redeeming qualities; as a villain he is without rival in recent memory. In a labyrinth as twisted and terrifying as the cinematic gauntlet del Toro has laid down here a good memory is invaluable. In ""Pans Labyrinth"" it is inescapable.Print Email Font ResizeReturn to Top Bay Area Olympians Kerri Walsh Jennings dug deep for gold medal No. 4 attemptTop 10 most historic Bay Area Olympic spots George F.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Balancing childlike enchantment with grown-up horror isnt easy and for a good long stretch at the start Guillermo del Toros populist fable Pans Labyrinth seems bound to fumble. Set just after the Spanish Civil War the film stars Ivana Baquero as a pre-teen girl who prefers to disappear into books especially when her pregnant widowed mother remarries and moves them to a remote mountain outpost to live with the ultimate wicked stepfather a cruel army captain played by Sergi Lopez. Throughout Pans Labyrinth del Toro cuts between Lopezs attempts to smoke out the remaining rebels camped in the surrounding forest and Baqueros retreat into a fantasy world where shes a reincarnated princess asked by a towering faun to carry out three tasks and thereby complete her transformation into an immortal. Obviously parallels develop between the war story and the fantasy story. Both are about quixotic quests and demanding authority figures and both have their share of magic keys and special potions. But for most of its first hour Pans Labyrinth doesnt fit together neatly. The fantasy sequences are wildly stylized and simplistically plotted while the war sequences are bloody and brutal. But in the second hour the stories begin to merge as Baqueros tasks start intersecting Lopezs mission and she has to decide whether she can trust the creepy-looking mythological creature whos telling her what to do. It would be a mistake to read Pans Labyrinth simply as a heroines journey with a little girl representing all the Spaniards who stood up to the fascists. This isnt really a movie about one person or one historical moment; its about the larger question of how history judges what we do. The republicans lost the Spanish Civil War yet even though history is written by the winners almost no one thinks of the fascists as the good guys in that story. In Pans Labyrinth Baquero disobeys and makes mistakes but shes still the heroine. In the movies moving final lines del Toro shows a flower blooming and holds Baquero up as an inspiration to anyone who feels that the world has gotten too dark for any light to break through. Hes deliberate in getting there but after two hours of dazzlingly fantastical images and stomach-turning gore del Toro winds around and finds his storys center.

"Shhhh De Niros Spy Flick Keeps It to a Whisper | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Style amp; Design Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Shhhh De Niros Spy Flick Keeps It to a Whisper By Andrew Sarris  01/08/07 1200am Robert De Niros The Good Shepherd from a screenplay by Eric Roth has been described as ""The Godfather of spy movies"" which is reasonably accurate as far as the depiction of violence is concerned as well as the emphasis on ethnicity which in The Good Shepherd is mostly multi-generational American ruling-class WASP while in The Godfather it was mostly the Italian-American (or more specifically Sicilian-American) lineage that was on the line. But the differences between the two films are more striking. Whereas The Godfather was based on a vividly lucid and transparent fictional narrative The Good Shepherd is made shadowy and secretive by its fictional variations on the founding and clandestine operations of the C.I.A. starting even before its official creation in 1947 from the Office of Strategic Services during World War II and more or less ending with the agencys disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion intended to overthrow the Castro regime. The motivation behind this period movie seems to be to make viewers even more suspicious of an outfit whose recent head assured President George W. Bush that proving the existence of concealed W.M.D. in Iraq would be a ""slam dunk."" Also the early sequences of the film places its central character in the midst of a Skull and Bones initiation at Yale that invokes W.s own reportedly colorful college days. The prevailing tone of the film is both cautionary and cynical in its very reasonable assumption that excessive secrecy can induce excessive paranoia among the operatives involved in maintaining the secrets to say nothing of the population at large. Matt Damon is in top form as the fascinatingly repressed Edward Wilson who is first seen in female garb and makeup in a collegiate production of Gilbert and Sullivans The Mikado. When a classmate asks Edward in the dressing room afterward what it feels like to be a woman Edward snaps back with a nervy ""Why do you want to know?"" This quickly establishes the pattern of Edwards terse wit though it must be added that the terseness often suppresses the wit. Mr. Damons Wilson is loosely based on the still-controversial James Jesus Angleton the legendary head of C.I.A. counterintelligence from 1954 to 1974. During his initiation ceremony into Skull and Bones Edward reveals upon request a literally deadly family secret to clinch his acceptance into what will prove to be only the first of several secret societies. His story also demonstrates his unremitting poise under pressure which eventually earns him the grudging admiration of his Soviet counterpart. Still Mr. De Niro and Mr. Roth have made Edward such an uncommunicative character throughout the film that much of the narrative is hobbled by understatement--usually an aesthetic virtue. I was also momentarily confused by the casting of dopplegangers Angelina Jolie and Tammy Blanchard as the two significant women in Edwards life. Ms. Jolie becomes his wife after an aggressive courtship on her part results in pregnancy making a hasty marriage imperative to preserve the honor of her high-society family. Ms. Blanchard is Laura a deaf Yale undergraduate who is Edwards first love and later mystifyingly an instrument of his betrayal after an extramarital venture on his part. I didnt think Ms. Jolie fell short in her thankless role as the neglected wife as some reviewers have argued--particularly in this era when good parts for Hollywood actresses are in especially short supply. As it is both women remain marginal and disposable figures in a predominantly male cosmos. The only other female character of any importance Martina Gedecks Hanna Schiller is Edwards assistant (and one-night-stand bedmate) in Berlin a double agent who gets rubbed out for her treachery--though not by Edward who always remains immaculately above the fray. It was only after I saw the film that I learned that Angleton was a close friend of William Empson the literary critic who wrote The Seven Types of Ambiguity. Suddenly the doppelganger casting for both males and females spies and moles friends and foes in The Good Shepherd made a kind of convoluted sense. Yet I feel that the visual imperatives of a cinematic narrative with doppelgangers require the more expert hand of an Alfred Hitchcock vide Anthony Perkins and John Gavin as the mirror images of each other in Psycho (1960) to make that point without ever confusing the audience. Hence though I do concede that the director and his collaborators have fashioned an absorbingly uneasy entertainment very much in tune with the contemporary zeitgeist I feel that Mr. De Niro pays a price for his otherwise admirable philosophically pessimistic consistency. It may be that my preference for Hitchcock (and Fritz Lang) over most of the modern practitioners of film noir reflects my taste for clarity over ambiguity. And The Good Shepherd is nothing if not ambiguous in its characterizations and its storytelling. Along the way Alec Baldwin as Sam Murach Edwards F.B.I. counterpart and William Hurt as Philip Allen Edwards C.I.A. superior managed to entrance me with their deftly deceptive role-playing. Truth to tell I sort of liked the movie despite my being left in the dark about many of its more complicated operations. Significantly the most brutal act of torture is performed by John Turturros Ray Brocco a self-proclaimed Italian-American subordinate in Edwards unit. Edward himself goes so far as to acknowledge his own ruling-class ethnicity when challenged by Joe Pescis Joseph Palmi a deportable Italian mobster. For that matter Mr. De Niro plays Bill Sullivan a non-Italian character based on ""Wild Bill"" Donovan the founder of the O.S.S. and Edwards recruiter into the world of espionage. One might note if only in passing that it is highly unusual for an American film to skirt the boundaries of political correctness by being so precise about peoples ethnicities. The most tantalizing performance in the film however is that of Michael Gambon as Dr. Fredericks a gay academic who is expelled from the Yale faculty for his supposedly pro-German activities as a double agent in British intelligence after the outbreak of World War II. This occurs after he has promoted Edward to the editorship of Yales literary magazine--ostensibly motivated by their mutual love of poetry but actually as part of an unsuccessful attempt to seduce him. This gay subtext is extended by the curiously mannered performance of Billy Crudup as Arch Cummings an affected operative based on the British double agent Kim Philby who was eventually exposed as a mole in the employ of the Soviet Union. These and other strands of Cold War double-agentry--on both sides--are scattered throughout the narrative with melodramatic embellishments. Still no previous American film has ventured into this still largely unknown territory with such authority and emotional detachment. For this reason alone The Good Shepherd is must-see viewing. The Older Man Roger Michells Venus from a screenplay by Hanif Kureishi would have served as a creaky vehicle for any aged actor less gifted and eternally luminous than the 74-year-old Peter OToole he of the soft blue eyes that long ago glistened against the snow and ice of Nicholas Rays The Savage Innocents (1960) and the desert sands of David Leans Lawrence of Arabia (1962). As an added dividend Mr. OToole briefly shares the screen with Vanessa Redgrave one of the most charismatic stage and screen actresses I have ever seen here cast as the lead characters amiably forgiving and long-ago-abandoned wife Valerie. Mr. OToole plays Maurice a retired actor who still performs bit parts on television shows. His two closest if often cranky friends Ian (Leslie Phillips) and Donald (Richard Griffiths) are like Maurice beyond-twilight thespians huddling together with their uppers and downers and much alcohol for chasers in one pub or another. Their ritualized routines are temporarily disrupted by the unexpected visit of Ians grandniece Jessie (Jodie Whitaker) who has come to town from the provinces where she lives with her strict parents supposedly to ""look after"" her aged granduncle. Instead Jessie spends her nights partying to all hours sleeping late in the morning and completely ignoring her presumed household duties. Ian is quickly fed up with Jessie and her slovenly ways but Maurice takes a less-than-platonic interest in the uneducated young girl and soon we have the comic spectacle of a deviously lecherous Henry Higgins pretending to educate his (in this case definitely not virginal) Eliza Doolittle by taking her to the art museum where she can appreciate the finer points of a nude by Velazquez. Though Jessie accepts a job that Maurice gets her as an artists model she is adamant in her refusal to let him see her naked. What is acceptable for her callow boyfriend is verboten to a leering geezer like Maurice. This distinction is something that Jessie senses instinctually but Maurice shamelessly perseveres in his pursuit--even after he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer making his quest for Jessies fair flesh more quixotic than ever. When Ian finally realizes what Maurice is up to he flies into a rage. Blows are struck though without any lasting impact on the two mens friendship which the inexorability of time threatens to make short-lived anyway. Mr. OTooles self-confessed excesses over the years have left him looking much older than his official 74 years which lends an existential pathos to his stirringly gallant portrayal. No one knows how much longer we are going to continue to be blessed by this incandescent talent. If indeed Venus is his swan song it resounds with a sweetly magnificent melody. Dont miss it. Scary Tales Guillermo del Toros Pans Labyrinth from his own screenplay is distinguished by another in a long line of recent child performances that are nothing short of astonishing in their accomplished matter-of-factness. The latest child virtuoso is 12-year-old Ivana Baquero who plays Ofelia the fairy-tale-fancying daughter of Ariadna Gils Carmen the pregnant wife of a Francoist general named Vidal who in 1944 has taken his present and future family into a forested mountain-garrison headquarters somewhere in northern Spain where the anti-fascist Loyalist guerrillas still operate. As Carmens second husband Vidal is actually Ofelias frightening evil stepfather who has driven the young girl with her feelings of loneliness and dislocation to seek refuge in her books of fairy tales. These ironically come to life for her in her forbiddingly isolated new surroundings. The familys very competent housekeeper Mercedes (Maribel Verdu) plays a pivotal role in establishing a connection between the fascist generals family and the anti-fascist partisans in the area. Mercedes brother happens to be a leader of the partisans and she and the garrisons doctor (Alex Angulo) arrange to bring much-needed medicines from the fascist pharmacy to the Loyalist guerrillas. Meanwhile Ofelia searches through magical caves and tunnels carved out of the mountainscape and encounters various manifestations of Pan (Doug Jones) and the King (Frederico Luppi) among other nocturnal creations of her fevered imagination. The two levels of reality are given equal weight in Mr. del Toros inventive mise-en-scene. He has traversed this supernatural territory previously in The Devils Backbone (2001) an anti-fascist ghost story set during the Spanish Civil War. He has long been an admirer and practitioner of the Gothic horror film beginning with his first film Cronos in 1993 followed by Mimic (1997) a wild horror film about genetically engineered insects; Blade II (2002) a vampire-versus-mutant contest of good and evil; and Hellboy (2004) the well-regarded adaptation of the Dark Horse graphic novels by Mike Magnola about a supernatural creature employed by the United States government as a ""secret weapon"" against its paranormal enemies. Mr. del Toro is never without a certain degree of humor in his various ghoulish ventures. The problem is that his often-frightening depictions of evil--as with General Vidal in Pans Labyrinth--tend to dehumanize his villains so completely that they become even less believable than the imaginary creatures in Ofelias book of fairy tales. I can understand the deeply entrenched hatred of Francos fascist regime among Spanish-speaking artists like Mr. del Toro but coupled with an addiction to the supernatural on a graphic level the combination becomes too negatively spiritual for my taste. However this is not to take anything away from the enormous talents of the director and his young star Ms. Baquero which make Pans Labyrinth eminently worth seeing despite its Manichean excesses.

D. James novel.   Credit PHILIP BURKE Something is afoot in Mexican filmmaking. That much is clear from three movies of the past year ""Babel"" which came out in October and now ""Children of Men"" and ""Pans Labyrinth"" both of them released for the holiday. The first was directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu the second by Alfonso Cuaron and the third by Guillermo del Toro (one of whose producers was Cuaron). Even if none of the films are to your taste you cannot miss something forthright in their attitude--a willingness to entangle themselves in mystery and to flit across established borders both of geography and of genre. All three directors have previously filmed in their native Mexico bequeathing us works such as ""Amores Perros"" ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" and ""Cronos"" but the urge to see the world or to elaborate on the angle at which they see it seems lately to have consumed them. ""Children of Men"" based on the novel by P. D. James takes place in Britain in 2027. Cuaron is no stranger to the British backdrop having made ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" but the new film eschewing magic casts a more noisome spell. The land served up for us is a stew of anxiety and intolerance seething with casual savagery and overlaid by a rancid sky. Some of the most enduring details are glanced at in passing a yellowing gush from a waste pipe at the edge of a muddy field or the projectiles that bystanders hurl at the caged windows of a train. On board is Theo (Clive Owen) once a political activist now a deflated bureaucrat. In Owens hangdog half-snarling expression we quickly sense a man who has had just about enough of life. The whole planet in fact has had enough there is mass infertility and the youngest person on earth we learn from a news report on TV has died. He was eighteen years old. This is an extraordinary premise for a film--a childless world--and it will leave some viewers feeling restive and underinformed. How they will want to know did this catastrophe arise? To Cuaron however the first rule of storytelling is Go with the given. Dont waste space on deep background and dont delay the action with a preface--remember Ben Kingsley intoning like a royal robot at the start of Steven Spielbergs ""A.I.""? Cuaron respects his audience presuming that we are grown up enough (or ground down enough) to work out the horrors for ourselves. ""Only Britain soldiers on"" we hear in government announcements. Slowly we realize that they are trumpeting a siege mentality; immigrants are being rounded up and imprisoned and to harbor them is a criminal act. (If this rings a bell among current worriers so much the better.) We also see commercials for something called Quietus but what is it? Mineral water? Migraine cure? Suddenly the truth snaps into place its a suicide drug. Hence the nasty taste of Hamlet in the brand name (""He himself might his quietus make / With a bare bodkin"") and the chill of the advertising slogan ""You decide when."" Nobody is being born and everybody picks a time to die. One day Theo is bundled into a van and taken to meet not as you expect the secret police but an old girlfriend Julian (Julianne Moore) who still tends the subversive flame. She and a gang of fellow-dissidents want Theo to use his contacts personal or professional to get hold of transit papers--the only guarantee of safe passage these days--for a young woman named Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey). Transported to the countryside Theo goes into a barn to meet Kee. Without warning you see on his exhausted face a look of purest wonderment for Kee is great with child. So thats why Universal chose to release the film on Christmas Day. The rest of ""Children of Men"" is a scruffy panting escape flick with Theo retrieving his sense of purpose and guiding the expectant mother to safety offshore away from the powers that be. Kee herself of course is the only power that is; without her all that humanity can look forward to is one big bodkin. There is a relentless sequence late in the movie when the two of them are smuggled into an immigrants camp on the south coast from where they plan to pick up a boat. Within the camp civilization has all but rotted away and when the Army arrives to restore order we get a pitched battle between the feral and the near-fascist (what a choice) filmed with such unbroken urgency--there are blurred spots of blood on the lens--that you may want to duck under your seat and wait for the hell to subside. When it does so the peace is immediate. Look up and you will see Kee cradling the baby to whom she has just given birth stepping calmly through ranks of armed men--disarmed now by the sight and the cry of something that no one has witnessed since the year 2009. The idea of the world redeemed by a helpless infant is a specifically Christian one but here it shines out from a landscape that is bitterly stripped of faith. The people I know who have seen ""Children of Men"" have admired its grip but they had to be dragged to the theatre; its a film that you need to see not a film that you especially want to. I guess it should it be logged as sci-fi yet by 2027 mankind is clearly beyond the reach of science and the roughened pace of the film--photographed by Emmanuel Lubezki--leans away from fiction and toward the natural stutter of reportage. When a bomb explodes in Tony Scotts ""Deja Vu"" it is tensely prepared for and filmed with a lingering gloat; when a bomb explodes in ""Children of Men"" it bursts from nowhere on a dreary street. Even if you dont buy the main conceit the scumbled texture of the movie makes it feel not just plausible but recognizable and Cuaron takes care never to paint the future as consolingly different. Theo doesnt go to work in an aluminum-foil catsuit with a diagonal zip; he wears a jacket and tie. And where the cars of ""Blade Runner"" hovered in the ruined air the vehicles here still trundle along on roads. The Britain of twenty years time in short will be just like the Britain of today but worse. The sole survivors--the only citizens not to have caved in to despair--are shaggy old-timers like Jasper (Michael Caine) a friend of Theos who saw it coming. He lives in a forest hideaway smokes weed plays loud music and still finds something to laugh about. Such is the moral of this tough destabilizing film the hippies were right all along. Reversing the flow of time we come to 1944 and the rustling backwoods of Spain. Here as related by Guillermo del Toro in ""Pans Labyrinth"" Francos army is plucking out the remnants of the opposition--republican diehards who dwell among the trees emerging only to fight. We could be watching an update on the tales of Robin Hood or a foreshadowing of Jasper in ""Children of Men."" Into this remoteness comes Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) a girl of ten who has travelled with her widowed mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil) to meet her new stepfather. He is an immaculate sadist by the name of Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez) who commands the local military outpost and who has ordered Carmen to join him; she is carrying their first child who will be born the Captain decrees in the old house where he is quartered. Ofelia not surprisingly feels surplus to requirements and she duly drifts off into the surrounding grounds as though into sleep. Indeed for much of the film we cannot tell whether Ofelias adventures like those of Alice in Wonderland are rooted in the real or secreted by her own imaginings. We know she is a bookish creature and what ensues has the rich scent of a fairy tale. Entering a stone labyrinth she walks down spiral steps into a subterranean cavern and meets a faun (Doug Jones)--""very old very tall and smelling of earth"" she says. He has the hooves of a shire horse and a pair of horns that could double as musical instruments. He bears about as much resemblance to Mr. Tumnus his fellow-hybrid from the pages of C. S. Lewis as the late Jack Palance bore to Woody Allen. Like any self-respecting beast of legend the faun sets our heroine three tasks. These entail crawling into the roots of trees fitting keys to locks letting fall drops of blood and other staples of a Freudian adolescence. Ivana Baquero her face both credulous and wise before its time seems ideally poised between the childish and the adult and that makes her a fine successor to Ana Torrent whose youthful performances in ""The Spirit of the Beehive"" (1973) and ""Raise Ravens"" (1976) are indispensable to the cinema of modern Spain. Like those great films ""Pans Labyrinth"" needs a child at its heart because it is partly about a nation striving to define itself and confronted by a confusion of paths. To Captain Vidal the way is clear ""I want my son to be born in a new clean Spain"" he says in a declaration of Fascist fatherhood. The cleanliness continues as he tortures an enemy suspect then washes the blood off in a shower of rain. No wonder del Toro turns his camera downward to the soil. The mud that Ofelia gets all over her best dress in which she was meant to greet a party of adults is a squelching badge of honor. One virtue of ""Pans Labyrinth"" is its sound design which discards any hint of the ethereal by turning up the volume on small supercharged noises the creak of the Captains leather gloves as he flexes his fists the nighttime complaints of floorboard and rafter or Ofelias teeth biting into a succulent grape. More haunting still is the howl of a mandrake root ""a plant that dreams of being human"" in the words of the faun. Del Toro as he proved in ""The Devils Backbone"" (2001) is enthralled by such transformations plant to human man to beast war to uneasy peace. He is helped by Sergi Lopez to whom the script offers little more than monstrosity but who somehow turns Vidal into the most mystifying presence of all; his resilience to pain as shown when he stitches up a knife wound to his own mouth is not so far from the courage required by Ofelia in her descent to the underworld. The question is do the two halves of the movie fit together? What does Vidals attempt to suppress the freedom fighters have to do with fauns and giant toads? There is thank heavens no neat allegorical match. Take the long-fingered hairless figure whom Ofelia finds in her nightmare and who as if in homage to Bunuel screws his eyeballs into his palms and holds up his hands in order to see and pursue her. He does not represent a historical person or embody a single threat; he simply conjures an atmosphere of cannibalistic fear and thus feels gruesomely right for an age of schism and feud. The odd thing is that for all this adhesive detail del Toro lets the fantasy slip slightly from his grasp preferring to focus on the brutalities of fact. By the end the three tasks seem of limited consequence whereas the fate of Vidal--and of the steel-willed housekeeper Mercedes (Maribel Verdu) who has taken Ofelia to her bosom--tightens to a merciless climax. So smartly has del Toro thought his fable through and so graceful is his grasp of visual rhyme that to pick holes in it seems mean; yet ""Pans Labyrinth"" is perhaps more dazzling than involving--I was too busy reading its runes and clues as it were to be swept away. It is I suspect a film to return to like a country waiting to be explored a maze of dead ends and new life.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Starring Ivana Baquero Sergi Lopez and Maribel Verdu. Directed by Guillermo del Toro. (In Spanish with subtitles. R. 112 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) After ""Pans Labyrinth"" Guillermo del Toro will never again be dismissed as a director of horror movies. The artistry evident even in ""Mimic"" and ""Hellboy"" is confirmed in spades in his new work a lock for an Oscar nomination as best foreign language film. Visually stunning it meshes haunting images with a complex multilevel story about the enchantment of youth -- a time when fairy tales take on a reality that can shield children from painful truths -- and the unadulterated evil of fascism. Whether intentional or not ""Labyrinth"" bears a resemblance to Picassos ""Guernica."" Del Toro uses a similar palette -- the color is so faded that some scenes appear to be black and white with shades of gray -- and his eerie mythical characters sport multiple eyes in unusual locations as on the famous mural. Most significantly the strokes of two true masters are used to conjure up a horrific representation of the brutality suffering and death during Spains long struggle for freedom. ""Pans Labyrinth"" begins in 1944 after the countrys civil war has ended with the defeat of the Republican forces aiming to preserve democracy. A delicate 12-year-old Ofelia (the intense young Spanish actress Ivana Baquero) distracts herself during a long car ride by reading about an ill-fated princess. Ofelia is on her way to an uncertain future. Her father was killed in the war and her mother has hastily married Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez) and is heavily pregnant with his child. When mother and daughter arrive in the northern countryside where Vidal heads the fascist militia fighting off guerrilla attacks Ofelia immediately spots a labyrinth. A kindly housekeeper (Maribel Verdu) tells her to keep away from it but the warning only ignites her interest. Del Toro and cinematographer Guillermo Navarros imaginations run wild creating a muddy netherworld overgrown with moss for Ofelia to enter. These scenes are breathtaking in their originality and spookiness. The creatures are menacing along with welcoming led by a 7-foot-tall faun who promises the youngster royal status if she carries out three tasks. Handing her an instruction book that turns out to be blank the pages soon begin dripping blood. A childrens film this is not. Ofelia senses her stepfathers cruelty before being confronted with evidence of it and retreats into her fairy tale world. Although her mother resents it fearing she is losing the girl she still entreats the girl to tell a magical story to her unborn baby brother. (In full macho mode Captain Vidal insists its a boy.) Theres an entrancing moment of Ofelia speaking directly into her mommys belly as the camera hones in on a fetus in a womb. Baquero exquisitely captures Ofelias confusion over what is real and what isnt at once seeming wise beyond her years and incredibly childlike. Her dark eyes reflect the pain caused by a war in which shes lost a loving father only to have him replaced by a brute. Lopez (known in this country for ""Dirty Pretty Things"" although hes worked extensively in Spain and France) chillingly shows the banality of evil. When Vidal shoots a couple of innocent peasants believing them to be guerrillas he blames his underlings for involving him. His vanity is such that he cant resist smirking into mirrors. Hes also got a thing about needing to know the exact time. He cradles a chain watch like a baby. As the seemingly obedient maid who secretly is with the resistance Verdu has the trickiest role. She displays almost no emotion as a spy in the enemys household would train herself to do. Verdu projects such utter blandness that its hard to recognize her as the sexpot in ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" who seduces two teenage boys. The scary real world in which all the females must tiptoe around out of fear of upsetting Vidal is juxtaposed with an almost-as-scary fantasy one. The latter becomes as believable to us as it is to Ofelia. Del Toros single misstep is to point out the girls hallucinations by having her stepfather walk in while shes talking to her faun. You see through the captains eyes that there is no one else there. Although ""Pans Labyrinth"" relies heavily on special effects including the computer-generated kind youre never aware of them. Del Toro who wrote the story has created a special universe. The spell it casts lingers long after the final reel. -- Advisory Disturbing images and violence.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Guillermo del Toro who calls himself ""the geek from Guadalajara"" fires up a classic cinematic fantasy in Pans Labyrinth a film for all ages as long as theyre open to gothic twists that scare them senseless. Del Toro is just one of the three amigos showing our local boys how its done. Mexico Citys Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu cemented his reputation with Babel the completion of a trilogy he began with Amores Perros and 21 Grams. Not to be outdone Alfonso Cuaron also from Mexico City and a producer of Pans Labyrinth follows up Y Tu Mama Tambien and the only memorable Harry Potter film (The Prisoner of Azkaban) with another knockout Children of Men. More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Still its del Toro 42 the gore master behind Hellboy and Blade II who springs the biggest surprise. Pans Labyrinth horrific and heartfelt in the way it sees the trauma of war through the eyes of a little girl is some kind of great movie. Nothing in del Toros previous work except his little-seen 2001 ghost story The Devils Backbone prepares you for the impact of watching harsh reality and harsher fantasy bleed into each other. To hail Pans Labyrinth for its visionary ravishments is hardly to do it justice. You leave del Toros one-of-a-kind film feeling youve never seen the world before not like this not with such aching beauty and terror in the service of obliterating barriers of time place genre and language. Set in the Madrid countryside in 1944 after the Spanish Civil War when Generalissimo Francisco Franco and his repressive fascist guard attempted to quell rebel uprisings the film makes no attempt to hide or soften the brutality of the period. If del Toro is the wizard of this surreal Oz then Ofelia played with resilient spirit and dark-eyed loveliness by eleven-year-old Ivana Baquero is his Dorothy. As the film opens Ofelia and her mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil) have arrived at a garrison commanded by Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez). Vidal is a sadistic monster unaware that his housekeeper Mercedes (Maribel Verdu touching and vital) is aiding the guerrillas he executes with cold-blooded abandon. Ofelia hates him which is too bad since Vidal is her new stepfather and her beloved mother is carrying his baby. Ofelias only solace is in the fairy tales she reads with devouring obsession. When her mother falls ill Ofelia retreats into a fantasy world that mirrors the ferocity outside. She finds a garden labyrinth ruled by Pan (Doug Jones of Hellboy) a tall goatish creature with menacing horns who sets her a series of tasks that have dire consequences if she cant complete them. There is also the Giant Toad and the shuddery Pale Man (also Jones) who holds his bulging eyes in his hands. With the help of production designer Eugenio Caballero and the superb cinematographer Guillermo Navarro del Toro uses puppets prosthetics and computer-generated images to create a haunting parallel universe where Ofelia can exert at least some control. Still its the perils of the real world that Ofelia must confront at last in the person of Vidal the spirit of fascism incarnate. Lopez is brilliant in the role taking screen villainy to new levels by showing how a cruel ideology can contort the human into the bestial. Del Toro never coddles the audience. He means for us to leave Pans Labyrinth shaken to our souls. He succeeds triumphantly. Dont Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox.

Running time 112 minutes. Rated R (graphic violence profanity). At the Lincoln Square the Empire the Sunshinte others. FOR me nothing this year comes close to being as utterly unforgettable as Guillermo del Toros ""Pans Labyrinth"" an extremely dark and disturbing fairy tale for audiences say ages 12 and up. Thats the age of Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) the bookish heroine of this outstanding film set in 1944 Spain where Francos fascists are still rooting out rebels long after that countrys civil war had ended. Ofelia and her very pregnant mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil) have been brought to a remote military outpost commanded by Ofelias stepfather the sadistic and officious Capt. Vidal (Sergi Lopez). While his wife is confined to bed Vidal is relentlessly pursuing and torturing guerillas who are secretly being helped by the captains housekeeper Mercedes (Maribel Verdu of ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"") and his doctor (Alex Angulo). At the same time as this very grim reality del Toro unfolds a stunning fantasy. Fairies lead Ofelia into a stone labyrinth where she meets the legendary faun (half goat half man) Pan who is extremely well played by an elaborately costumed Doug Jones who appeared in del Toros ""Hellboy."" Pan reveals to Ofelia that shes a lost princess and assigns her three tasks to complete to regain her throne - facing everything from a giant toad to a skeletal creature with eyes in his hands. Meanwhile Ofelias mother has become very ill and the captain is closing in on the traitors in his household. Del Toro builds almost unbearable suspense until at last the two worlds converge for a stunning - and very frightening - climax. Besides ""Hellboy"" the Mexican director has alternated mainstream flicks such as ""Mimic"" with art-house fare such as the horror film ""The Devils Backbone"" which was also told against the background of the Spanish Civil War. ""Pans Labyrinth"" which closed this years New York Film Festival represents a quantum leap in del Toros storytelling drawing on ""Alice in Wonderland"" ""Pinocchio"" and many other inspirations to create something quite new and wonderful. The acting is terrific and the visuals are mesmerizing. Its like a cross between ""Schindlers List"" and ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"" though with vastly more style than last years movie version of the latter. Yes its in Spanish with English subtitles - but like the really great filmmakers del Toro tells much of the story without dialogue. And yes there is a scene of torture and mutilation that is not for the squeamish. But going back to the Brothers Grimm fairy tales are supposed to be scary as well as magical. ""Pans Labyrinth"" scores off the charts on both counts. Trust me on this one or youll miss the years best movie. Honest.

"A real scary fantasy - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEW A real scary fantasyIn `Pans Labyrinth its no easy escape from Francos Spain through fairy tale land.December 29 2006|Kenneth Turan | Times Staff Writer THE Mexican-born writer-director Guillermo del Toro is the most accomplished fantasist in contemporary cinema a master creator of images atmosphere and mood who uses his visionarys gifts to do what others cannot make imaginary worlds seem more real than reality itself.With ""Pans Labyrinth"" Del Toro has made his most accomplished film to date a dark and disturbing fairy tale for adults thats been thought out to the nth degree and resonates with the irresistible inevitability of a timeless myth.This is a film thats set in two parallel worlds the cold brutal one of Spain in 1944 just after the triumph of Francisco Francos fascism and an equally disturbing alternative universe that a serious 10-year-old girl named Ofelia stumbles upon behind an old mill.This world may be a kind of refuge from the savagery shaking Spain but dont mistake it for a bright and sunlit place. Ofelias found universe is dangerous in the extreme a pitiless arena where mistakes have serious consequences and trusting anyone even those who claim to be your friends is fraught with peril.What makes ""Pans Labyrinth"" so remarkable is Del Toros equal facility with both of these worlds. Starting from his debut feature 1995s marvelous ""Chronos"" hes always had a gift for the fantastical but as 2001s spooky ""The Devils Backbone"" demonstrated he also has an ability shared with Peter Jackson but not many others to deal with equal ease with the psychology of human relationships.In ""Pans Labyrinth"" Del Toro has perhaps his strongest cast ever beginning with the protean Sergi Lopez most familiar as the hotel manager in Stephen Frears ""Dirty Pretty Things"" and including Maribel Verdu almost unrecognizable (she was the heartthrob of ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"") and young Ivana Baquero as Ofelia.Del Toro also has the advantage of finally getting a crack at a project thats been on his mind for years. ""Its very dear to my heart"" the director said after the film debuted at Cannes. ""Its the movie Ive done that I like the most that most resembles the things I thought I would do when I began directing.""All that time considering ""Pans Labyrinth"" has meant that Del Toro has been able to both think up and sketch out in the notebooks he always carries with him the myriad specific details that make Ofelias world so compellingly real. There is a sense with this film that every last specific has been thoroughly thought through that the filmmaker is so at one with the material that he is actually living it with his characters.Before we properly meet those characters a voice-over tells us of the existence of a timeless underground realm ""where there are neither lies nor pain"" a world that once had a princess. She left it to experience life on Earth and had her memory blotted out by the sun but her father the king of the underground has always held out hope that her soul would return even if in another body.Ofelia we find out immediately is a girl who is passionate about fairy tales. She and her pregnant mother (Ariadna Gil) are making an arduous automobile journey to a remote part of Spain where her mothers new husband Captain Vidal is engaged in exterminating the last gasps of Republican resistance to Franco.Played with a kind of terrifying panache by Lopez the captain is both a fairy tale villain and an all too real psychopath who kills innocents without compunction or remorse. Its also safe to say that no one has ever taken more visible pleasure in wearing black leather gloves than this disturbing sadist.Even though Ofelia finds an ally in the captains somber housekeeper Mercedes (Verdu) it is no wonder the girl is eager to wander off and flee the house. Which is how she comes across an ancient labyrinth leading to a wide circular staircase that opens onto that underground world.Ofelias first steps waken an ancient and completely marvelous creature a faun who might be the god Pan himself but who prefers to say only ""Ive had so many names ... old ones that only the wind and the trees can pronounce.""Old though he is the faun immediately recognizes the girl as the long-awaited Princess Moanna returned to take her rightful place in the underground kingdom. Before she can do that however the faun insists like any good fairy tale enabler that Ofelia must perform three tasks before the moon is full ""to make sure her essence has remained intact.""Those tasks each more daunting than the last bring the girl into contact with a series of strange and wondrous creatures from a monstrous toad with a huge tongue to a terrifying monster called Pale Man an echo of Goyas child-devouring Saturn whose eyes are to be found in the palms of his hands. (Mime Doug Jones a Del Toro regular is the actor underneath both the faun and the Pale Man makeup and the work he does is irreplaceable.)Between these creatures and what happens above ground with Vidals army and the resistance ""Pans Labyrinth"" has its share of quite violent and potentially disturbing moments. Yet because the violence is used not for titillation but to create a world we can be fearful about because the film lives up to its tagline that ""Innocence has a power evil cannot resist"" we see it all without wishing we were somewhere else.""Pans"" stories of whats happening underground and aboveground subtly reinforce each other but the film refuses to say what exists and what does not. It not only leaves us free to determine how real Ofelias world is it trusts us to make the right decision.kenneth.turanlatimes.com""Pans Labyrinth.""

His latest finds him subterranean once again this time burrowing down to a fantastical universe where elves and fairies -- so small that they are invisible to human eyes -- live in harmony with nature. Adapted from a series of childrens books authored by Besson himself (based on an original idea by Celine Garcia) this live-action/computer-animated hybrid follows 10-year-old Arthur (Freddie Highmore) who in order to save the home he shares with his somewhat addled grandmother (Mia Farrow) must decipher a diary left by his grandfather before he mysteriously disappeared four years ago. Following the clues Arthur now a 3-D animated figure sporting cool shades and spiked hair enters the mythical Seven Kingdoms where he joins forces with sexy CGI Princess Selenia (voiced by a delightfully unrecognizable Madonna) and her chubby rubber troll of a brother Betameche (Jimmy Fallon) as they battle the evil Lord Malthazard (David Bowie) for buried treasure. Predictable and overly busy this sci-fi adventure should nonetheless appeal to computer-game-savvy tots especially those familiar with the source material while boring their parents silly. Highmore is sweetly exuberant but the voice talent is uneven and the only really clever bits find the CGI characters navigating real live foliage. (Beverly Center) (Jean Oppenheimer)BLACK CHRISTMAS Ever the devoted public servant I went to see this grisly little horror movie (which opened without benefit of preview screenings) by myself on Christmas. That makes me sound like a real loser but in truth going alone to scary movies takes me back to adolescence when my folks would drop me off at the local twin theater and I would gleefully experience soul-warping chillers with titles like Sssssss and Asylum. Writer-director Glen Morgan who co-produced the Final Destination films appears to have had a similarly unhealthy youth because whenever he gets a hankering to direct he remakes a horror classic of the 1970s. First came 2001s Willard (which wasnt bad at all) and now theres Morgans fast-paced but unsatisfying remake of a 1974 film by director Bob Clark (Porkys A Christmas Story) that few saw at the time but which has since been credited with influencing John Carpenters Halloween and the 30 years of slasher-movie brutality that followed. The gimmick first devised by screenwriter Roy Moore is simple On Christmas Eve a snowbound houseful of sorority girls are picked off by a killer who calls the house phone in between killings to rant in a variety of voices all of them creepy. In Clarks version we never saw the killers face or knew his reasons for killing. Here in a series of flashbacks Morgan tells of a boy who grew up in the house with an evil mother who drove him mad. The flashbacks are wittily gothic and the present-day murder scenes have the absurdist chain-reaction intricacy of the Final Destination deaths but the sorority girls -- buxom babes all -- are so interchangeable and so uninteresting that I got to wishing that Morgan and all those who tread the lucrative horror remake market would take the time to create a bona fide heroine whose survival we could cheer. Hey does Jamie Lee Curtis have an actress daughter? (Citywide) (Chuck Wilson)  THE DEAD GIRL Karen Moncrieffs dark showily acted ensemble piece begins where torture-porn flicks typically climax and move on -- with a girls mutilated body. Here the discovery splits the film into five stories of women somehow linked by the murder four afters and a before each providing its own partially obscured angle on the crime. Moncrieff who made a promising debut in 2002 with Blue Car  doesnt force some overlay of cosmic linkage on the stories The plot strands that connect the five women are direct and plausible. Most often images and details rhyme between the stories in mysterious ways -- the wifes pet rabbit and the dead girls stuffed bunny for example or the burning of news clippings by two characters for gravely different reasons. The top-notch cast includes Toni Collette Marcia Gay Harden Mary Beth Hurt Kerry Washington Rose Byrne and Brittany Murphy. The truncated stories force the actors to start at a high pitch and keep going but they -- and the director -- work wonders at low volume.

Sep. 13 600pm FAST TRACK Being cast out by the Weinstein Company into the wilds of January with barely a blip of advertising support director Jesse Peretzs Fast Track doesnt stand a chance at finding an audience -- which is a shame because when it works (which is at least half of the time) this antic romp has the off-the-wall go-for-broke zaniness of that other great modern screwball comedy David O. Russells Flirting with Disaster. When career slacker Tom (Zach Braff keeping his ""look how cute I am"" tics to a welcome minimum) gets fired from his latest job he packs up wife Sofia (Amanda Peet) and their newborn kid and trades life in the Big Apple for the calming pleasures of small-town Ohio -- Sherwood Anderson country. There he takes up his sad-sack father-in-law (Charles Grodin) on the offer of an ""assistant associate creative"" position in a new-agey advertising company where Tom soon finds himself under the thumb of Sofias paraplegic former classmate (and possible ex-flame) Chip (Jason Bateman) a seemingly benevolent cripple whos really a Machiavelli on wheels. Thats an inspired starting place for a farce and Peretz (working from a sometimes tasteless often insidiously funny script by first-time screenwriters David Guion and Michael Handelman) has a knack for casting the kind of bright comic talents -- Amy Adams Donal Logue Mia Farrow and Paul Rudd round out the ensemble -- who more or less just have to show up. The movie is Batemans to steal however which he does early and often whether re-enacting an old high-school cheerleading routine or trying to seduce Sofia by showing her the money shot from one of his favorite movies Coming Home. (Beverly Center 13) (Scott Foundas) THE FLYING SCOTSMAN Barely a year after The Worlds Fastest Indian we get The Worlds Fastest Schwinn? Well not exactly but its hard to keep Roger Donaldsons picaresque true-life tale about an eccentric New Zealand coot and his home-built motorbike totally out of mind while watching first-time director Douglas Mackinnons true-life about... an eccentric Glasgow coot and his home-built racing cycle. Only whereas Donaldsons movie was all heart Mackinnons is pure hokum. Its not that the story of Graeme Obree (Jonny Lee Miller) -- a former competitive cyclist who came out of self-imposed retirement in the 1990s to set a couple of world speed and distance records -- lacks for dramatic incident but as rendered by Mackinnon and screenwriters John Brown Declan Hughes and Simon Rose it has a terminal case of the cutes crossed with the labored earnestness of a disease-of-the-week melodrama. When Obree isnt busy being a maverick (taking apart a washing machine to use its bearings for his bike inventing new riding positions that are subsequently banned by mean-spirited racing officials) he battles the roller-coaster mood swings caused by his manic depression (which the movie never names outright a la the homosexuality of Suddenly Last Summer) and in one downright looney sequence that may or may not be a paranoid fantasy gets chased through the streets by the same schoolyard bullies who taunted him in childhood. All thats missing is the PSA coda in which the cast appears on screen out of character to say ""If you know someone who may be suffering from depression..."" (Fallbrook) (Scott Foundas)MISS POTTER See film feature. (Showtimes)NOTES ON A SCANDAL Queasily parked between halfhearted satire and overcooked melodrama this adaptation of a well-received 2003 novel by British writer Zoe Heller offers the unhappy spectacle of a raft of acting talent trying to do right by slimy material. The setting is one of those modern London high schools where what passes for education is pure ""crowd control"" but the premise -- an unlikely bonding between two lonely women teachers -- reaches all the way back to cut-rate Muriel Spark. Judi Dench is infuriatingly good as that reliable old Eng-lit creation the lesbian closet case whose repressed passions have warped her into a manipulative witch ready to whack all who stand in the way of her deluded desires. Director Richard Eyre (Stage Beauty) asks us to take on trust the emotional isolation of Denchs object of desire (the always excellent Cate Blanchett) who enjoys a rich domestic life whenever shes not shagging a 15-year-old special-needs pupil in her art studio after class. Setting aside the scads of preposterous plot contrivance Patrick Marbers screenplay is full of jaundiced cleverness about Englands intricate class system but thats far from enough to save this disreputable movie not the least of whose sins is that it manages to elicit a bad performance from Bill Nighy -- which Id have thought was close to impossible. (ArcLight; NuWilshire; Playhouse 7) (Ella Taylor)PICK PANS LABYRINTH Like his terrific 2001 The Devils Backbone Mexican horrormeister Guillermo del Toros new movie offers us both real-life and fantastical monsters and if you know his work you wont waste time figuring out which to root for. Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) a little girl whose anxious dark eyes recall those of that other dreamy daughter of the fascist era -- the Frankenstein-obsessed Ana from Victor Erices The Spirit of the Beehive -- is the link between harsh reality and dark fantasy in the savagely beautiful Pans Labyrinth which is set in 1944 in the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War. Trying to protect her sick mother (Ariadna Gil) who is pregnant by the austere officer (a menacing Sergi Lopez) in charge of rooting out the tattered remains of the rebel opposition Ofelia seeks refuge with the encouragement of a friendly maid ( Y Tu Mama Tambiens Maribel Verdu) in a classically del Toro underworld of dripping caves and grabby tree branches long-tongued toads and helpful fairies ruled over by a demanding but fair-minded faun (Doug Jones). Where the world up top is full of fascist spit and polish and sadistic violence for powers sake -- ever devoted to his beloved genre del Toro rubs our faces in nearly unbearable defacings both literal and symbolic -- down below Ofelia finds in the contents of her own troubled mind terror aplenty and a subversive challenge to confront the wicked stepfather whos ruining her life and Spains. Though never sentimental del Toros hopeful ending is as historically premature as it is true to the trust he places in the redemptive power of the imaginative life. (Selected theaters)  (Ella Taylor) PERFUME THE STORY OF A MURDERER A multimillion-euro adaptation of a best-selling German novel Perfume The Story of a Murderer relates the life of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) born in 18th-century Paris with a uniquely puissant sense of smell. He begins life as an orphan sold into servitude to a brutal tanner but in Toucan Sam fashion follows his nose into the rarefied world of perfumers where his superhuman gift proves highly valuable. After a brief yet intense infatuation with the bodily smell of a comely fruit monger leads to her sudden death Grenouille becomes obsessed with discovering the means to create a permanent record of an individuals scent and to concoct the most powerful perfume possible. The pungent plot may sound preposterous and indeed its hard not to snicker early on when Grenouille is introduced as a mere nose hanging in darkness his inner life revealed via a digital zoom up his nostril. But Perfume s hyperfragrant world strives beyond mere physical sensuality toward a spiritual erotic. Its a noble experiment in pushing the limits of cinema but one too many sequences of ruffling silks and dreamy flower bouquets evoke little more than the ad-agency cliches of an elongated Chanel No. 5 commercial. (ArcLight) (Ed Halter)THE RULES OF THE GAME ""What is natural these days?"" a lady dressing for the evening asks her maid who finds Madames violet lipstick a bit too artificial. The year is 1939 the place Paris after the Munich Conferences false promises of peace and on the eve of Hitlers deadly march across Europe. The question tossed off in the first few minutes of The Rules of the Game is like so much else in Jean Renoirs masterpiece at once frivolous and poignant -- a melancholy lament for a world gone awry delivered in a tone so light you might think you had missed it. The film follows the amorous exploits of a group of aristocrats invited to a hunting party at a French chateau. Their spineless yet sympathetic host the wealthy Jewish Marquis de la Chesnaye (brilliantly played by Marcel Dalio) entertains himself with mechanical toys when hes not attempting to rid himself of a cumbersome mistress. Meanwhile his beautiful foreign-born wife (Nora Gregor the stage name of an Austrian princess) must contend with the adoration of a dashing aviator (Roland Toutain) -- a romantic hero thrust into a society devoid of illusions. Renoir himself is unforgettable as the friend and hanger-on Octave a failed artist haunted by a sense of missed opportunities. Their hectic intrigues find an uncanny echo in the affairs of their servants upstairs and downstairs comically crossing paths on the way to a tragic conclusion. The dazzlingly labyrinthine script never mentions the coming war yet its menace permeates a milieu that seems to have lost all moral compass and where the ideal of happiness has been sacrificed to one of mere amusement. The Rules of the Game provoked something like a riot at its Parisian premiere. ""People who commit suicide do not care to do it in front of witnesses"" Renoir said of the French response to his film which beneath its frothy veneer showed their society going down the drain. The film was cut twice and its original negative was destroyed by Allied bombing. The occasion for this re-release is its complete restoration from a master print. It is required viewing if only to understand the ideal that filmmakers from Robert Altman to Woody Allen have been after. Even if you think you know it see it again for its newly rediscovered depth of field and even more for its infinite wellsprings of character and empathy. (Nuart) (Leslie Camhi) THE TIGER AND THE SNOW In an apparent attempt to revive the lukewarm blend of tragedy and comedy achieved in his concentration-camp-set Life Is Beautiful  Roberto Benigni here plays out a madcap tale of romantic obsession against the backdrop of the Iraq invasion. The results are neither profound nor funny. Benigni casts himself as Attilio a university professor who is shown early in the film expounding platitudes on poetic inspiration to a lecture hall of multicultural students who laugh with unrealistic spontaneity at his Robin Williams-esque antics. This doggerel Dante has his own Beatrice a woman who appears to him as his bride in recurring dreams and then seems to materialize in the flesh as Vittoria (Benignis real-life wife Nicoletta Braschi) a writer working on a biography of Attilios friend Fuad (Jean Reno). The film shifts from banal to tasteless as the war begins. Fuad calls Attilio from Baghdad informing him that Vittoria has been severely injured. Attilio rushes to Iraq to save her. Perhaps somewhere in Tiger lies a dim Bush parable Attilio as bumbling narcissistic go-it-aloner stumbling into Iraq with ill-conceived intentions. But the metaphor doesnt hold The outcome of this mess were in wont leave Bush a benighted romantic.

"Pans Labyrinth | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; pan-s-labyrinth ) Pans Labyrinth (Mexico/Spain/United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli One of the most anticipated releases of the 2006 holiday season is the latest offering from Mexican director Guillermo del Toro whose previous credits include The Devils Backbone Blade 2 and Hellboy. With Pans Labyrinth del Toro opens a landscape where gothic fantasy elements are infused into the real-life horrors of the second World War. Set in Spain during the days immediately before and after D-Day the movie provides a window into the mind of a young girl who seeks escape from a life that features a cruel stepfather and a mother whose difficult pregnancy is killing her. But is this girls method of escape a portal into another reality or is it a conjuration of her fairy tale obsessed imagination? Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) isnt just having a bad day shes having a bad life. Her country is war-torn with the fascist government battling the rebel maquis. Her father has died a victim of the fighting. Her mother (Ariadna Gil) alone and unprotected was forced to marry the vicious Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez) and conceive his child. She is now nearing full term but the pregnancy is killing her. The potential of being left alone in the world with Vidal is enough to turn Ofelias blood to ice. One day while exploring the terrain around her new rural home she discovers an ancient labyrinth made out of huge slabs of rock. Within live creatures of myth fairies and fauns. Ofelia learns an amazing thing she is the long-lost princess the daughter of the King of the Underworld. To prove her worthiness of this title she must complete three tasks set out for her by the faun Pan (Doug Jones). If they are done before the next full moon she will be welcomed into her kingdom. Perhaps the films greatest asset is the way in which it interweaves Ofelias quests with the tale of the Spanish resistance fighters. Both are equally compelling. When one story is being told we are sufficiently involved that we arent anxious to return to the other. This is an achievement. Many films with ""split personalities"" invest all their creative energy into one aspect of the story causing the other one to founder and feel obligatory. The set design and special effects which go hand-in-hand are impressive. The gloom of the labyrinth with its crumbling stone structures permeates the outside world. (Or should that be the other way around?) I used the word ""gothic"" earlier and its an apt descriptor of how the entire film feels. CGI effects are used in creating the fairies the faun and a few other creatures. By not overusing them and overwhelming us del Toro prevents Pans Labyrinth from seeming to have been assembled on a computer. His actors especially young Ivan Baquero and Sergi Lopez are excellent. The term ""fairy tale"" can be used to describe Pans Labyrinth and references to The Wizard of Oz are not out of place. However these should not go along with the expectation that this is a kid-friendly movie because it is not. It contains scenes of graphic violence and images that will cause all but the most stalwart children to have nightmares. Some scenes like one in which a character is forced to use a needle and thread to close a gaping wound may cause even adults to flinch. However the lack of family friendliness does not diminish what del Toro has achieved with this magical motion picture.

"In Spains fascist heyday Labyrinth cocoons a child - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs In Spains fascist heyday Labyrinth cocoons a childPANS LABYRINTH (star)(star)(star)(star)December 29 2006|By Michael Wilmington Tribune movie critic""Pans Labyrinth"" Guillermo del Toros horrific yet (wonderful tale of a little girls dream world during Spains worst era of fascism is a great cinematic fairy tale--a brilliant work of the imagination capable of truly seizing and igniting our fantasies.Del Toro a master of more conventional genre horror in his witty vampire film ""Cronos"" and the comic book epic ""Hellboy"" here transports us to an era of tyranny and bloodshed--rural 1944 Spain in the still violent aftermath of the 1936-39 Spanish civil war--and then carries us further to the magical realm of fairies and fauns that seems to exist in the mind of a smart spunky child Ofelia (11-year-old Ivana Baquero).Ofelia a little girl of fathomless curiosity and resilience becomes trapped in the world of Franco-era reality--of marauding guerrillas and fascist soldiers--when her mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil) marries the brutal outpost commander Capitan Vidal.As played by the extraordinary Spanish actor Sergi Lopez Vidal is a blood-chilling movie villain a portrait of true evil ruling over a domain where anyone can be tortured or shot at a moments notice. Against him outmanned are the guerrillas and their sympathizers in Vidals household including the quiet housekeeper Mercedes (Maribel Verdu of ""Y tu mama tambien"") and the anguished Dr. Ferreiro (Alex Angulo).The cold-blooded Capitan has a courtly considerate veneer with Ofelia and Carmen--who is pregnant with the child he insists must be a boy--and throughout Ofelia is torn between the real world of fascism and her own lively imagination. Near the beginning we see Carmen and Ofelia in an elegant limousine being driven to Vidals embattled outpost; after it stops briefly Ofelia spots a crumbling statue and a buzzing dragonfly (a magnificent CGI creation that later turns into a shimmering fairy) the first harbingers of her private underworld.That magical realm which Ofelia enters later through a well-like labyrinth she discovers in a garden on Vidals headquarters is packed with wonders and terrors. In it are beasts who carry their eyes in their hands huge toads with tongues like red pythons and Ofelias guide the capering faun Pan (Doug Jones) who informs her that she is a lost princess of this fairy realm and must accomplish three tasks to return to her rightful kingdom.Del Toro frames ""Pans Labyrinth"" as if it were a Brothers Grimm fairy tale with a ""Once Upon a Time""-style narrator. The film then unwinds in flashback switching back and forth between the apparent ""fantasy"" and the reality of 1944 Spain. Despite that story-hour narration del Toro implies that the fairy tale is Ofelias bulwark against Vidals real world. But a true master of horror and fantasy he presents Ofelias underworld as if it were real too. (Maybe it is.)In the end ""Pan"" succeeds both as a spectacular special-effects fantasy and as a psychological drama with superb actors. Lopezs Vidal especially is a chilling embodiment of both fascism and of relentless realism. In ""With a Friend Like Harry . . . "" Lopez played the memorable obsessed psychopath Harry who was a Hitchcockian terror. But Vidal would have dispatched Harry with a quick shot to the brain.A remorseless murderer Vidal is also a hardheaded pragmatist who despises fairy tales is inwardly contemptuous of women and observes everyone with a cruel irony. Against Vidal Carmens vulnerable love is useless and the doctors civilized liberalism is impotent. For del Toro only fantasy or revolution can defeat him.""Pans Labyrinth"" is all the more affecting because del Toro so effectively ""places"" the fantasy in real life in a place and an era he also portrayed in his 2001 ""The Devils Backbone."" Up to now del Toro--one of a brilliant trio of Mexican filmmaking comrades along with Alfonso Cuaron (one of ""Pans"" producers) and Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu--has mostly proven himself a first-rate horror craftsman in the vein of his own favorite filmmakers like George Romero Mario Bava and James Whale. But ""Pans Labyrinth"" proves him a real artist with a deep and harrowing vision of the world.""Pans Labyrinth"" one of the years great movies is an incredible achievement that takes us to the roots of fantasy and horror. As we enter Ofelias underworld/wonderland we can become amazed and enthralled at both the terrors of the reality outside and the splendors of the imagination within.- - -`Pans Labyrinth(star)(star)(star)(star)Directed and written by Guillermo del Toro; photographed by Guillermo Navarro; edited by Bernat Vilaplana; production designed by Eugenio Caballero; music by Javier Navarrete; produced by Alvaro Augustin Alfonso Cuaron Bertha Navarro Frida Torresblanco.

The movie pitches us into the midst of a barbaric civil war in Sierra Leone in 1999 in which the profits from illegal or ""conflict"" diamonds sold on the black market to reputable European companies (a tiny splinter of the diamond trade) are used to fund arms on both sides of the war.A rare pink diamond coveted by all is the ""MacGuffin"" that sets the plot in motion. Its found and secretly buried by Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) a Men-de fisherman rounded up by marauding rebel forces and forced to work in their mines. They have also kidnapped his 14-year-old son to join their legions of brainwashed doped-up child soldiers and Solomon is counting on the money his diamond will bring to save his boy. The gem is equally coveted by diamond smuggler Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) a tough amoral ex-mercenary from Zimbabwe for whom the diamond represents his ticket out of war-torn Africa. He promises to help Solomon rescue his family for a cut of the profits but he in turn needs the help of American journalist Maddy Brown (Jennifer Connelly). What she wants is Archers help in exposing the complicity of the Western diamond trade in the exploitation of the Third World. Their quest to retrieve the prize fuels the movies non-stop action.Fast-moving and brutally entertaining Zwicks movie from a Charles Leavitt screenplay is undeniably gripping but the by-the-book Hollywood melodrama (Will the cynical Archer discover a conscience? Will the aggressive journalist fall for his bad-boy charm?) doesnt always sit comfortably with the hellish images of hacked-off limbs machine-gun-toting child soldiers and teeming refugee camps. Theres something disturbingly formulaic about the ferociously well-staged outbursts of violence which arrive with a metronomic regularity that can seem more opportunistic than organic. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week But there is much to admire here. Zwick (""Legends of the Fall"" ""The Last Samurai"") who can err on the stolid side seems energized and engaged by the African milieu hes in peak form. DiCaprio transformed by his pitch-perfect South African accent is utterly convincing as a tough driven adventurer he exudes the masculine charisma he hadnt grown into in ""Gangs of New York."" Hounsou as always cuts an imposing sympathetic figure but it would be nice if for once he didnt have to play a noble moral paragon. ""Blood Diamond"" only skims the surface of many important subjects--the script doesnt begin to explain what the civil war was about. But if it opens a few eyes it will have done its job.London 2027. while the rest of the world has collapsed into chaos the United Kingdom conjured up in Alfonso Cuarons gripping but problematic dystopian thriller is hanging on by a militaristic thread. Terrorist bombs explode near Piccadilly. Immigrants and refugees are rounded up and held in pens awaiting deportation. The world is plagued by infertility its been 19 years since a baby was born. How do you live with no hope of a future for the species?The former activist Theo (Clive Owen) has succumbed to whisky-fueled numbness--until hes called upon by his ex-lover (Julianne Moore) now a radical leader fighting for refugee rights to get transit papers for Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey) a young African woman who desperately needs to flee the country. Theres good reason for the urgency Kee is pregnant.Cuaron and his phenomenal cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki bring this bleak terrifying near-future to life in astonishingly tactile images. Cuaron (""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" ) is one of the most exciting filmmakers around. He stages breathtaking action sequences one in which marauding thugs attack a car in the countryside is unlike anything youve seen.The filmmaking is so accomplished you wish it were matched by the script which was adapted from a P. D. James novel by Cuaron and four other credited writers. (That many scribes is never a good sign.) ""Children of Men"" is clearly more than a thrilling chase movie its meant to hold a barely distorted mirror to the world were living in now. But the characters are too sketchy for the political metaphors to resonate. (The exception is Theos old hippie mentor and friend beautifully played by Michael Caine a pot-smoking cartoonist whos retreated to his hidden home in the woods.) The infertility theme isnt explored in any depth. What exactly will it accomplish to get Kee out of the country? Since the future of mankind rests on this pregnant girl we want details. ""Children of Men"" leaves too many questions unanswered yet it has a stunning visceral impact. You can forgive a lot in the face of filmmaking this dazzling.If youve never seen a movie by the ghoulishly inventive Mexican director Guillermo del Toro you are in for a unique treat. Del Toro alternates between personal Spanish-language films such as ""Cronos"" and ""The Devils Backbone"" and American horror movies such as ""Mimic"" and ""Hellboy."" He also likes to mix high and low genres fantasy and reality in unexpected ways. Theyve never merged as hauntingly as they do in ""Pans Labyrinth"" which blends a fantastical fairy tale into the harsh reality of Francos Spain just after the civil war.The tale is told through the eyes of young Ofelia (played by 13-year-old Ivana Baquero) who is uprooted to a rural military compound when her sickly pregnant mother (Ariadna Gil) marries a Fascist captain (Sergi Lopez) a harsh authoritarian cleansing the countryside of the last remnants of the Republican opposition. Her only friend is the housekeeper (Maribel Verdu from ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"") who is secretly aiding the rebels. Lonely and frightened Ofelia retreats into a world of fantasy. In a maze in the woods she meets the ancient satyr Pan (Doug Jones) himself who challenges her to assume her true regal identity by undergoing a series of tests. Ofelia enters an underground kingdom of ogres monsters and spells; we see how this magical universe echoes her real life and how in this fable of innocence courage and evil the lessons of her fairy tale have to be applied in the real savage world.Suspended between the brutally graphic and flights of lyrical fancy ""Pans Labyrinth"" unfolds with the confidence of a classical fable one that paradoxically feels both timeless and startlingly new.The Third man."" ""Casablanca."" ""Notorious."" These great 1940s movies and many more will come to mind while youre watching ""The Good German"" and for good reason. Steven Soderberghs black-and-white melodrama may be brand new but it is a 40s movie right down to the typography used in the credits and the big Thomas Newman score. Set in partitioned Berlin just after the end of World War II it has an urbane war-correspondent hero (George Clooney) sent to Germany to cover the Potsdam conference a femme fatale who reeks ofDietrich-like doomed glamour (Cate Blanchett as Clooneys old flame now reduced to prosti-tution) a callow young American corporal (Tobey Maguire) milking the ruined city for black-market profits and international skullduggery involving Nazi scientists coveted by both the Soviets and the Americans.It sounds delicious what movie lover doesnt want to take this nourishing trip down memory lane? But the siren call of Old Hollywood can be as treacherous as this woman of mystery. Attempting a frame-by-frame duplication of Warner Bros. 40s filmmaking--even the extroverted acting style apes the period--Soderbergh has produced a movie so self-conscious that its drained of all life. ""The Good German"" written by Paul Attanasio from a Joseph Kanon novel promises a seduction but it plays like an academic exercise. Soderberghs skill intelligence and love for the genre are never in doubt. But as it turns out you cant play it again Sam.Clint Eastwood tells the story of the Battle of Iwo Jima from the Japanese side in ""Letters From Iwo Jima."" You can view it as a bookend to his recent ""Flags of Our Fathers"" or on its own. Either way its unprecedented a sorrowful and savagely beautiful elegy that can stand in the company of the greatest antiwar movies.Written in English which was then translated into Japanese by the young Japanese-American Iris Yamashita (who shares story credit with Paul Haggis) the screenplay brings to life four indelible characters all of whom know there is little chance theyll leave the island alive. General Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) is the untraditional officer in charge who devised the 18 miles of tunnels that enabled the Japanese to withstand the American invasion for almost 40 days. He fights with the irony that having spent time in the United States before the war he reveres Americans. Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya) is an irreverent young baker who just wants to stay alive to see his newborn daughter. The aristocratic Baron Nishi (Tsuyoshi Ihara) is a famous equestrian who competed in the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics. Private Shimizu (Ryo Kase) was trained in the elite military police but shipped off to Iwo Jima for disobeying orders to kill a dog. We see as well the old-guard officers who would shoot any soldier who tries to surrender and who when defeat seems inevitable order their men to die with honor by blowing themselves up with grenades. Eastwoods depiction of the horrors of war--and the atrocities committed on both sides--has a shocking intimacy.If ""Flags"" is more complex in its ambitions and structure the leaner simpler ""Letters"" is even more emotionally devastating. Superbly acted unblinking and unhysterical it looks beyond politics into the hearts and minds of the men we needed to call ""the enemy"" and lets us see ourselves.Movie trailers as we all know can be deceptive as anyone who went to ""Man of the Year"" expecting a knee-slapping Robin Williams satire can attest. The early glimpses of ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" starring Will Smith and his 7-year-old son Jaden had me fearing a tear-jerking blast of Hallmark card ""uplift."" The actual movie written by Steve Conrad and directed by the Italian Gabriele Muccino (""The Last Kiss"") is something quite different theres an inspirational hang-on-to-your-dreams message but it comes only at the very end of a long grim painful journey. Holiday cheer is not what this movie is offering.The movie is a fictionalized version of a true story about Chris Gardner (Smith) a smart struggling medical-supplies salesman in San Francisco in 1981 who dreams of becoming a stockbroker. In the film he takes an unpaid internship at Dean Witter--a huge and some might think irresponsible risk because only one intern will be chosen for a position at the firm. In debt with a fed-up wife (Than-die Newton) who walks out on him he ultimately loses his apartment and is thrown onto the streets with his son. They sleep in subway bathrooms and homeless shelters while during the day Gardner dons suit and tie and charms customers into investing with Dean Witter.Chris can be a fast-talking charmer but Smith is not coasting on his usual bouncy bravado here. He digs deep tapping into a ragged desperation and an urgent paternal protectiveness thats a far cry from ""Men in Black."" Newton doesnt stick around long but she makes a powerful impression as a woman knotted up with anger. And young Jaden Christopher Syre Smith is a natural. Muccino to his credit resists milking his million-dollar eyes for undue pathos.I respect the movies tact its honest exploration of homelessness its surprising refusal to exult in the rags-to-riches aspects of Gardners story but I cant say I was transported. Theres a repetitious one-note quality to the storytelling--the bone-density machine Chris sells gets stolen one too many times--that adds to the sense of oppression. I didnt see the ""20/20"" show about the real Chris Gardner that inspired the movie. But I suspect I would have come away more amazed and moved than I was by this honorable but dogged effort.Director Robert De Niro and screenwriter Eric Roths ""The Good Shepherd"" is nothing if not ambitious. In two hours and 40 minutes of grave hushed shadowy images it attempts to tell the story of the formation and transformation of the CIA. It begins with the agencys failed Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961 loops back to the late 1930s when the Office of Strategic Services (the CIAs predecessor) was created and then takes us on a globe-hopping trip through the cold war.All this is filtered through the fictional story of Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) a young Yale student plucked from the secret Skull and Bones society in 1939 to serve his country by spying on a suspected Nazi-sympathizing professor (Michael Gambon). The bright well-bred Wilson is an idealist but even as a young man theres something shut off about him he says little hides his emotions and is strangely passive in the presence of women even one as seductive as Clover (Angelina Jolie) whom he dutifully marries when she gets pregnant. Soon after he joins the OSS and whisks off to London and later Berlin not to return until his son is nearly 7. ""The Good Shepherd"" charts Wilsons devolution--and the agencys--from patriotic idealism to paranoid isolated ruthlessness. The cost of secrecy is his soul and his family.For the films mesmerizing first 50 minutes I thought De Niro might pull off the ""Godfather"" of spy movies. The tradecraft fascinates the sociology is astute the tense chess match between Wilson and his KGB counterpart ""Ulysses"" (Oleg Stefan) has an intricacy worthy of le Carre. But the unvaryingly solemn tone begins to wear and the elaborate flashback structure becomes confusing in the last act. Roths script is great on the cat-and-mouse games weak on the destruction of Wilsons marriage. Jolies character is barely coherent. And Roths choice to build an epic around a character as hooded as Wilson is risky its a testament to Damons skill and charisma that we care at all about this clenched careerist.Still even if the movies vast reach exceeds its grasp its a spellbinding history lesson. ""The Good Shepherd"" demands you watch it like a spy alert paranoid never knowing whom you can trust or who will stab you in the back.Shes vile beyond belief"" moans Ian (84-year-old Leslie Phillips) complaining to his friend and fellow veteran actor Maurice (74-year-old Peter OToole) about the young mulish working-class girl (Jodie Whittaker) belligerently ensconced in his flat as his ""nurse."" Maurice however whos always had an eye for the ladies takes one look at the sulky Jessie in her pink track suit and is enchanted.So begins the unlikeliest of May-December romances--his interest in her is sexual though he can no longer perform; her interest in him is strictly platonic--and so begins ""Venus"" a heartbreaking comedy that is simultaneously funny and sad raunchy and sweet funky and elegiac. These fresh unexpected juxtapositions are a specialty of the writer Hanif Kureishi (""My Beautiful Laundrette"") a sworn enemy of cliche.The once beautiful Maurice an elegant but blasphemous old thespian who still gets work playing deathbed cases on TV is a dream part for OToole. The lyricism and grace he had as Lawrence of Arabia have never left him--nor have the superb comic instincts of ""My Favorite Year."" Hes not playing himself here but his performance is haunted by our memory of the younger OToole. When his ex-wife played by Vanessa Redgrave spots Maurice in an old movie on TV and says ""Oh God how handsome you were"" we know exactly how she feels.Phillips is a delight as the prissy self-dramatizing Ian and Whittaker is a real find she makes Jessies ""Pygmalion"" -like blossoming utterly convincing. Under Roger (""Persuasion"") Michells brisk tender direction ""Venus"" works on every level. Its a bittersweet meditation on mortality a lovely valentine to the acting profession and a fine romance with no kisses.The aptly named Barbara Covett a stern resentful and lonely teacher at a shabby London secondary school is a master of both deception and self-deception which makes her a very dangerous woman and a pathetic one. Played with acid-tongued relish by Judi Dench in a radical departure from her roles as royalty shes a deliciously nasty piece of work.Barbara whose closest companion is her cat has fallen in love though she would never put it that way. The focus of her obsession is Sheba Hart (Cate Blanchett) the new art teacher. Attractive young happily married with two children and a ""bourgeois bohemian"" sense of privilege Sheba is everything Barbara isnt--and everything Barbara wants to be.Imagine her shock when she discovers Sheba in the arms of her ardent 15-year-old student Steven (Andrew Simpson). But Barbara quickly gets over her horror when she realizes the glorious opportunity this presents. Now their fates will be forever interlocked. It will be our little secret she tells the shaken Sheba as long as you give up the affair.""Notes on a Scandal"" is a wicked delight. Adapted by playwright Patrick Marber from Zoe Hellers acclaimed novel its at once a comedy of cluelessness and class a melodrama of two women in the grips of wildly inappropriate obsessions and a ""Fatal Attraction""-style thriller. Its not easy to pull off the tales delicate mix of tones but Richard (""Iris"") Eyres zesty direction gets it just right. (Philip Glasss throbbing score however gets it wrong.) Blanchett whos played her share of queens has never been more intriguingly life-size. The restless willful Sheba is a wonderfully complex role a devoted mother married to a loving much older husband (Bill Nighy) she falls into her passionate affair with the cocky schoolboy having no real idea what shes doing or why. Hes just a callow average kid with raging hormones which makes the folly of her misplaced emotions all the more poignant--and funny. What happens when the scandal gets out Ill leave for you to discover. Even if you know the novel youll hang on every twist and turn.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Entertainment News Were often so entranced by the wonder of fairy tales that we overlook their horror. Even old folk tales that have been cleaned up and reworked over the ages still harbor relics from the days when we thought it was a good idea to rule kids by fear Parents and stepparents with sinister hidden personalities; children who get baked into pies; winged or scaled creatures who demand impossible tasks of a hero for reasons that are sometimes murky. Fairy tales have their roots in very old very deep human fears fears that Guillermo del Toro teases out mercilessly in his ambitious glorious and harrowing adult fairy tale ""Pans Labyrinth."" This is a somber lovely picture set in Francos Spain a few years after that countrys civil war. Its rich both in metaphorical terms and in literal ones. Del Toros imagery is so vivid and concrete that its likely to change the color of your sleep A writhing cooing root thats ""almost"" a human baby; a faceless creature with pale wrinkly skin draped over its willowy bones its eyes located in the palms of its hands instead of in its head. Those far-side-of-sleep images (and the movie contains many others) can be read as symbols and stand-ins for other things -- a nascent country that might have been; so-called leadership thats howlingly blind -- but del Toro isnt playing a game of allegorical one-to-one matching here. The movies meanings emerge from its visuals instead of being driven by them. Del Toro has mastered the delicate difficult feat of using pure sensation to make us think (listen to a podcast of him talking about the film here). The heroine of ""Pans Labyrinth"" is a little girl who wont be little for much longer Ofelia (played by a wonderful young Spanish actress named Ivana Baquero) is just on the edge of adolescence -- a time that seems to go on forever while youre living through it but is really only just the barest sliver of moon in a lifetime. Her father has died and as the movie opens shes traveling through the Spanish countryside with her fragile pregnant mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil) to a remote military outpost where the father of the baby Carmens new husband -- and Ofelias stepfather -- is waiting for them. That stern ramrod of a man is Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez of ""Dirty Pretty Things"") and when he greets the arriving travelers (theyre late) it becomes clear that hes barely interested in Carmen and has even less interest in Ofelia Hes fixated on his unborn child which hes certain will be a boy. Although Carmen urges Ofelia to make the best of her new life shes desperately lonely in her cold surroundings The captains huge dark house -- he has turned an abandoned mill into his military headquarters -- creaks and groans at night as if it were alive; there are ghastly creatures carved into the posts of the bed she shares with her mother. Her only friends are the cherished books she has brought with her and the captains sympathetic but cautious servant Mercedes (Maribel Verdu of ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"") who is secretly spiriting food and medicine to the rebel fighters who live in the nearby forest still hoping to overthrow Francos oppressive government. And then a greenish buzzing insect that Ofelia befriended in the forest just before her arrival reappears to her and transforms before her eyes into a tiny flying man. He leads her to an underground lair where a strange faun (Doug Jones) with curly rams horns and piercing feline eyes reveals her true identity to her He believes she is really Princess Moanna daughter of the King of the Underworld. But before thats certain she must perform three dangerous tasks. You Might Also Like Ofelias -- and del Toros -- fantasy universe includes a secret garden with mysterious dead ends and passageways and a miniature kingdom beneath the roots of a gnarled tree where a fat king toad lives atop a carpet of mud and millipedes. At one point Carmen makes a new dress for Ofelia a dark-green pinafore thats intended to impress the captain. On this very serious-looking little girl with her dark bobbed hair and even darker eyes the dress is an inversion of the cheerful blue frock worn by Alice in Wonderland. But in ""Pans Labyrinth"" the through-the-looking-glass world and the real one are one and the same. The horrors of Ofelias real life (her mothers dangerous and difficult pregnancy; her stepfathers murderous indifference to her) are barely distinguishable from the fantasy obstacles she faces. Del Toro draws no comforting reality/fantasy boundary for us. Ofelia cant awake from the reality of her dream. And this is where I need to warn parents ""Pans Labyrinth"" opens around holiday time which may lead some of you to think its a great thing to take the kids to while theyre on vacation. This is a true fairy tale and one of the finest fantasy pictures ever made but please do not take your young children to see it unless you want them to be scarred for life. The movie is probably OK for an extremely well-adjusted 12-year-old. But even extremely well-adjusted grown-ups may find the movies creatures and crawlies -- and its less fantastic violence -- stalking their nightmares. That Im sure is del Toros intent. ""Pans Labyrinth"" drew glowing praise at Cannes last spring and this is one case in which rapturous word of mouth doesnt ring hollow. This is del Toros sixth feature and its not only one of the great fantasy pictures but one of the great end-of-childhood elegies. The movies political undercurrents run deep and strong but del Toro isnt interested in ideological screeds -- in fact he greatly distrusts blind ideology as he has shown in earlier pictures like the resonant comic-book fable ""Hellboy"" and the astonishing ""The Devils Backbone"" (set a few years earlier than and in many ways a warm-up for ""Pans Labyrinth"" although the picture stands tall on its own). ""Pans Labyrinth"" works on so many levels that it seems to change shape even as you watch it. It is at times a joyless picture and its pall of sadness can begin to weigh you down. But thats part of del Toros intent and of his technique. At one point the faun -- whose motives are never quite clear either to us or to Ofelia -- expresses his displeasure with her accusing her of being weak of being only human. He tells her that like others of her kind shes destined to die ""All memory of you will fade in time."" Thats a horrifying thing to hear and not just when youre a child. But del Toro doesnt buy this cruel taunt and with ""Pans Labyrinth"" he disproves it. Memories are carried in myths and stories; thats one way they survive. All those dragons slain and stepparents defied None of it has been in vain. If fairy tales were all simply pretty they wouldnt have stuck with us awake and asleep for so many centuries.

Liam Lacey From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Friday Dec. 22 2006 1200AM EST Last updated Thursday Jul. 11 2013 234PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Guillermo del Toro Written by Guillermo del Toro Starring Ivana Baquero Ariadna Gil Sergi Lopez Classification 14A Year 2006 Country Spain Mexico USA Language Spanish Mexican director Guillermo Del Toro is best-known to English-speaking audiences for his ghoulish comic-book adaptations such as Hellboy or Blade II but he also makes more personal Spanish-language films such as Chronos and The Devils Backbone. Like that latter film Pans Labyrinth is a childs story set against the tragedy of the Spanish Civil War and it may well be his masterpiece. This is like no movie youve seen before a haunting mixture of horror history and fantasy that works simultaneously on every level. In the 1940s while Franco is victorious in Spain and war still rages across Europe young Ofelia (13-year-old Ivana Baquero) is relocated to a military outpost with her sickly pregnant mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil). Ofelias real father has been killed and her pretty mother has married the fascist Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez) to ensure the survival of herself and her daughter. The captain is a handsome brutal sadist who can barely tolerate Ofelia and whose main interest in her mother is to bear him a son.He spends his days with a handful of soldiers working to exterminate the remnants of the Republican guerrilla stragglers in the woods. His enemies have allies in the military camp including a humanitarian doctor (Alex Angulo) and the housekeeper Mercedes (Maribel Verdu from Y tu mama tambien) who is also Ofelias only friend.The girl retreats into her books of fairytales and on walks in the woods into a fantasy world. After entering a maze in the woods she encounters a mythical faun who introduces her to an alternative reality. Fans of C.S. Lewiss book The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe (or the recent movie) may feel theyve been on this path before. From the outset though the details are more insidious and foreboding.The faun is neither cute nor uncertain. The gnarly old satyr (Doug Jones) seems to be made of tree roots. He is ancient and quick to snarl in anger and while hes less frightening than her stepfather he may be just as sinister. He insists she must realize her rightful identity as an underground princess by undergoing a series of terrifying tests.The fantasy allows Del Toro to give full sway to his use of digital creations -- straight from the land of nightmares -- on the screen. Theres a monstrous toad with a key in its mouth which lives under an ancient tree sucking out its life. Theres also a faceless pale naked humanoid creature looking both fetal and aged with eyes in the palms of its hands which sets out a tempting feast to entrap anyone who dares eat.Meanwhile in the outside world Ofelias mother is suffering from the difficult last stages of her labour. The captain is busy torturing and killing his captive prisoners and for Ofelia events are coming to a crisis.Pans Labryinth is no fairy tale and not a point-by-point allegory though the voracious monsters Del Toro has created are instinctively understood as manifestations of fascisms romance with cruelty and death. The movies most impressive accomplishment is the way it moves between the two worlds without suggesting the deeper reality of one or the other.This year has been an exceptional one for Mexican filmmakers Alfonso Cuaron who served as an executive producer on Pans Labyrinth directed Children of Men; Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu directed the globe-trotting story of miscommunication Babel. All three men were born in the early sixties and work both in Spanish and English and theyve brought a freshly grown-up imagination to mainstream movies. Even at their most fantastic as with Pans Labyrinth these films arent really escapist; theyre about those things were trying to escape from.Opens Christmas Day Report Typo/Error Follow Liam Lacey on Twitter liamlacey Comments Print /License AA In the know Life This woman became a middle-age man magnet.

Its a familiar even archetypal story well suited to the dreamlike parallel reality of cinema Alice Wendy and Dorothy found their ways on screen and have been joined by the young heroines of Labyrinth Spirited Away and Mirrormask to name just a few. Pans Labyrinth is another version of the tale but an unusual one in that it isnt suitable for children. Not only is it replete with violence visited on the body but its lessons - in the inadequacy of fantasy as a countermeasure to repression - might have sensitive youngsters chucking in the towel.As in The Devils Backbone and a prospective new project 3993 del Toro (who is Mexican) arranges his supernatural drama against the backdrop of the Spanish Civil War. The setting is 1944 so the conflict proper is over but skirmishes continue between anti-fascist guerrillas and forces under the command of sadistic narcissistic Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez) - or father as young Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is instructed to address him when she arrives at his forest base with her pregnant ailing mother (Ariadna Gil) Vidals new bride. The maid Mercedes (Maribel Verdu) is friendly and in some ways a mirror character for Ofelia but the girl is basically alone - until a large cricket transforms into a fairy and leads her to a crumbling stone maze in the grounds where an ageing faun greets her as a lost princess pending her completion of certain tasks...Its no coincidence that the fairy appears after the double-killing that establishes this fable isnt kids stuff or that the jeopardy of Ofelias challenges pales in comparison to real-world struggles. Reality increasingly dominates the story; in fact the fauns realm can seem merely the stage for a series of set-pieces whose grotesque and detailed design impresses more than any sense of momentum or high stakes.Yet as escapist fantasies go this supernature is markedly muddy - both literally as when Ofelia ventures into the belly of a great tree and in the general creepiness that marks even those ostensibly sympathetic to her like the faun with its unnerving habit of appearing in her bedroom. The labyrinth has echoes of authentic atrocity a pile of childrens shoes lies ominously near the banqueting table of a bald-bodied blank-faced baby-eater. At least as evident though is del Toros own immersion in fantasy and horror cinema with nods to Dont Look Now Rosemarys Baby and The Shining among others (not to mention Goya and The Spirit of the Beehive). Its as a filmmaker rather than storyteller that del Toro is most successful here a disjunction remains between the storys childlike form and its gruesome execution but few directors are so adept at conveying both the uncanny in the real and the recognisable in the fantastic.

A fairy tale not even remotely intended for children this entrancing magical-realist drama concocts a sinister spin on ""Alice in Wonderland"" against the war-torn backdrop of 1940s Spain Will rely heavily on strong reviews and the loyalty of del Toros fans. Theres plenty of blood -- both literal and figurative -- coursing through the veins of ""Pans Labyrinth"" a richly imagined and exquisitely violent fantasy from writer-director Guillermo del Toro. A fairy tale not even remotely intended for children this entrancing magical-realist drama concocts a sinister spin on ""Alice in Wonderland"" against the war-torn backdrop of 1940s Spain shifting between two worlds with striking craft and discipline. With its graphic phantasmagorical elements and Spanish-language dialogue pic will rely heavily on strong reviews and the loyalty of del Toros fans when Picturehouse releases it Stateside in October. International prospects look more promising. Though hes best known for directing the comic book adaptations ""Blade II"" and ""Hellboy"" the Mexican helmers sixth feature marks a return to the supernatural trappings and delicately shaded emotions of his 2001 ghost story ""The Devils Backbone."" Like the earlier film ""Pans Labyrinth"" (with five credited producers including del Toros countryman Alfonso Cuaron) is set during the violent aftermath of the Spanish Civil War and reveals a similar concern for the plight of children living under fascist rule. Opening voiceover tells the myth of a princess who fled her underground kingdom to reach the human world where she eventually died leaving her father to pine for the return of her soul. Storybook narration transitions smoothly into scenes of a bookish young girl Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and her mother Carmen (Ariadne Gil) traveling through the Spanish countryside underscoring the films matter-of-fact melding of the real and the fantastical. Carmen is pregnant by her new husband a proud and cruelly sadistic captain in Gen. Francisco Francos army named Vidal (Sergi Lopez) who is trying to snuff out a guerrilla uprising nearby. While her mother is bed-ridden Ofelia goes exploring and discovers an intricate stone labyrinth where she encounters the legendary faun Pan a half-man half-goat (played by ""Hellboys"" Doug Jones in a goat mask) with a chillingly glassy stare. The faun tells Ofelia that she is the lost princess and must complete three dangerous tasks to return to her underground home. Ofelia accepts this news readily and some viewers may not be quite convinced by her utter composure and unquestioning demeanor as she agrees to Pans challenge. Though the early setups will likely prove the greatest strain on audience credulity del Toros masterful direction shifts from fantasy to reality and back again with remarkable fluidity. As Ofelia goes about her tasks -- which include escaping from the skeletal Pale Man (Jones again) a spectacularly designed creature with oddly positioned eyeballs -- the helmer maintains equal focus on the war front as Vidals housekeeper Mercedes (""Y tu mama tambiens"" Maribel Verdu) and doctor (Alex Angulo) bravely conspire to keep the guerrilla revolt alive. The result is a slow-burning war drama that deepens audience involvement by incremental degrees punctuated by brief but potent spasms of visual grotesquerie that show Marti production designer Eugenio Caballero and visual effects supervisor Everett Burrell and special effects supervisor Reyes Abades working at a very high level. Despite pics intense level of stylization digital f/x are sparingly and precisely applied never devolving into visual overkill. Del Toros taste for matter-of-fact surrealism inevitably means that some of the storys metaphorical and mythological underpinnings remain elusive though for the most part the storys flow is so relentless that explanations feel almost unnecessary. With her quiet resilience and enormously expressive eyes Baquero makes an ideal if slightly milquetoast heroine. Shes nearly upstaged however by the far spunkier Verdu whose skill with a blade makes for one of the films most satisfying (and least magical) scenes. As Vidal the reliably creepy Lopez creates a complex indelible and vaguely Freudian portrait of chauvinism and fascist mania run amok. Guillermo Navarros cinematography bathes Caballeros Goyan fantasy-scapes in a warm orange light while favoring a cool blue palette for the nighttime sequences. Javier Navarretes supple score proves extraordinarily subtle in conjuring a grim sense of wonder. Sound work is exemplary.
