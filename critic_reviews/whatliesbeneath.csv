Starring Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer. Directed by Robert Zemeckis. (Rated PG-13. 130 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Harrison Ford has taken the plunge and its about time. Fords summer blockbuster is called ""What Lies Beneath"" and the title is a brilliant one working on several levels. The deepest meaning will not be revealed until this thrillers eerily satisfying climax. Ford plays off his familiar image in unexpected ways both subtle and large that are good for him and the movie. It is a big departure for the actor who really needed one after last years ""Random Hearts"" and for director Robert Zemeckis (""Forrest Gump"" ""Contact"") and Michelle Pfeiffer. Is ""What Lies Beneath"" a supernatural thriller? Or is it all in the mind? They might even come to the same thing which is one of the reasons this latest Zemeckis production keeps percolating in the memory long after all the Hitchcockeyed referencing -- and the screams -- have died down. Pfeiffer -- whose face here is so thin and angular it makes stress sculptural -- must carry long stretches of this elegantly spun-out thriller herself. As the high-strung wife of a geneticist (Ford) who is all too aware of his standing in the community and how it easily could be ruined Pfeiffer is variously skittish prone to hallucinations paranoid amnesi ac and as if that werent enough possessed by another personality -- of a lip-nipping thigh-straddling bad-girl sexual aggressor. They appear to be the ideal couple. Both Dr. Norman Spencer and his wife Claire however are haunted -- he by the memory of his illustrious father and she by an apparition she starts glimpsing in watery reflections. When Pfeiffer enters the bathroom of their comfortable lakeside house in Vermont its fair to ask if the ghost she sees there is that of Alfred Hitchcock. Zemeckis certainly does. Anybody so inclined can find in this picture echoes of ""Rear Window"" ""Vertigo"" and most unavoidably ""Psycho."" It must be too tempting I guess for a director shooting a murder scene anywhere near a shower to make allusions to ""Psycho"" and its no accident Ford is called Norman. But Zemeckis has something else up his sleeve. He is known for ratcheting the special effects up a notch in each of his productions from the live action combined with animation in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" (1988) through the morphing in the Meryl Streep comedy ""Death Becomes Her"" (1992) to the legless wonder of Gary Sinese in ""Forrest Gump"" (1994). ""What Lies Beneath"" goes Hitchcock one better by imagining what it would be like if the master had the advantage of digital technology. Excuse me. Hitchcock didnt need digital technology. The really imaginative thing would have been to duck it so to speak altogether. Brian De Palma already has the role of Hitchcock grave robber sewn up. What really matters in Zemeckis thriller is that it works. His high-tech touches are just that exquisite touching up. They do not call undue attention to themselves but enhance the chills. Zemeckis biggest digital effects here are the goosebumps. Its not smoke and mirrors in ""What Lies Beneath"" but water and mirrors. Water images run through this film beginning with the mist that clouds the bathroom mirror when Claire is drying her hair. There is a downpour a lake and a river. The tub fills deep enough to drown someone. It will end in ice a frozen grave. For two-thirds of the film the camera work too flows like water always in motion at least until it is deflected by a mirror or other elusive reflections. The effect is disorienting. Claire is so disoriented she begins telling her anxieties to a psychiatrist (Joe Morton) who in a funny touch offers her a jawbreaker. There are bigger laughs in this film most of them nervous laughter. In addition to seeing shimmering reflections of a face Claire stumbles upon other strange events. Doors open in advance of her hand on the doorknob. Mirrors and glass in photo frames break. She has a psychic friend -- no she does not call a 900 number. She phones her best pal (Diana Scarwid) who brings over a book on witchcraft and a Ouija board. There is a new couple next door (James Remar and Miranda Otto) whose loud lovemaking is a turn-on for Claire and Norman. Claire curious about them is something of a voyeur and suspects trouble. Is it another reflection of Claires own troubles? Fords performance is out of sync with the audiences expectations. A flash of the signature lopsided grin here seems phony. The Ford anger here is not righteous but a cover for marital infidelity. His display of comfortable confidence cannot last as his wife goes further around the bend. -- Advisory.

No sooner do the opening credits vanish for instance than were in the pleasurably queasy voyeuristic neighborhood of Rear Window. On first introduction Norman Spencer and his wife Claire appear invulnerable to hazard. Hes a prominent scientist who because hes played by Harrison Ford projects middle-aged manliness at its most laconically virile. Shes a former cellist the mother of a college-aged daughter and she brims with the melancholy loveliness of Michelle Pfeiffer. The couple live in a Vermont lakefront dream house; those who dont nurse a crush on Ford or Pfeiffer can covet the furniture. But Claire is skittish distrustful of her own instincts even her sanity as Hitchcocks women can be. (Her restless dread cant only be the result of empty-nest disorientation.) She hears disturbing sounds coming from the house next door where the neighbors (James Remar and Miranda Otto) are seen and heard loudly arguing -- or just as disturbingly engaging in noisy sex the sounds of pleasure indistinguishable from those of pain. Closer rear-window peeping with binoculars only unnerves Claire more. First she observes the man trudging around at odd hours with a heavy Raymond Burr-like step suspiciously lugging what appears to be a body bag through the pouring rain and loading it into his car. Then the mans wife appears to have disappeared. Is the husband a murderer? ""Hes harmless. He wouldnt hurt a flea"" Norman (Norman get it?) baits Claire (who in the course of the movie begins to see clearly). Still unexplained phenomena in Claires own pretty house while her own handsome husband is off at work spook her further. She starts to develop the paranoia of Joan Fontaine in Suspicion; she also starts to develop a sixth sense. Doors open and shut spontaneously sometimes accompanied by puffs of I-see-dead-people steam wafting from her mysteriously self-filling bathtub; a certain framed photograph falls to the floor demanding attention. At times Claire actually does glimpse the face of a ghostly woman hovering behind her after which even the attentions of a kindly but skeptical anti-Spellbound psychiatrist (Joe Morton) cant assuage her conviction of foul play. The cinematic references continue to accrue with even greater more daring chutzpah a shower-curtain nod to Psycho; a fetish-object kiss to Vertigo; a preference for anxiety-inducing low-to-the-ground camera angles; composer Alan Silvestris effective imitation of bits of Bernard Herrmanns famous scores. This is Robert Zemeckis having fun. Throughout his career from Back to the Future to Forrest Gump to Contact the director has excelled at creating complete compelling universes true to themselves and handsomely composed. Just as importantly he knows how not to junk up a frame with unnecessary stuff. With What Lies Beneath though what presses down is the weight of too many genres jostling for screen time a neurosis of the story rather than of the storyteller. Screenwriter and theater-based actor-director Clark Gregg throws equal parts marriage-in-peril thriller crazy-woman-stalker fantasy murder mystery and ghost story into his script. At some unrevealable point the movie takes a sharp unrevealable turn and suddenly the dominant homage is to Fatal Attraction complete with bathtub trauma. (Water is repeatedly significant.) And Ghost. And Ashley Judds car troubles in Double Jeopardy. And inevitably this plot restlessness affects the performances of the protagonists. After his corpse-on-corpse chemistry with Kristin Scott Thomas in Random Hearts and Julia Ormond in Sabrina Fords star-on-star alliance with Pfeiffer is a relief the two Hollywood A-listers a pleasing love match of dignity and sex appeal. But as Norman Ford has relatively little to do for two thirds of the movie and what he does do must do always feels bent by the screenwriters iron whim rather than by psychological inevitability. Meanwhile Pfeiffer electrically alive in some scenes must carry the burden of Claires emotional hysteria at a price. Unnaturally forced to toggle between torpor and rising panic she alternates faces of fragility and determination that familiar achingly delicate Pfeifferian tendril of vein always pulsing in her forehead. (She ought to get out and scream more; it suits her.) The lies buried in What Lies Beneath are in the end not very interesting. The rampant sampling and storytelling overload -- prevalent movie weaknesses these days -- result in parts greater than the sum of the whole. For what rises above we can thank Zemeckis and of course Hitchcock who knew that what lies beneath is almost always too frightening to bear.

Revisiting the turf of stylish thrillers in which an upscale yuppie couple is haunted by mistakes of the past story centers on a genius researcher and his loving wife played by Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer whose seemingly happy marriage and stable life are utterly shaken by mysterious events that spiral out of control. Intermittently scary but not fully absorbing this DreamWorks-Fox co-production should grab strong opening numbers due to shrewd marketing that positions pic as an adult thriller. Overall B.O. should be above mid-range but not stellar for a convoluted thriller bogged down by a familiar plot and middle-aged protagonists that might not prove especially alluring to youngerviewers.

Revisiting the turf of stylish thrillers in which an upscale yuppie couple is haunted by mistakes of the past story centers on a genius researcher and his loving wife played by Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer whose seemingly happy marriage and stable life are utterly shaken by mysterious events that spiral out of control. Intermittently scary but not fully absorbing this DreamWorks-Fox co-production should grab strong opening numbers due to shrewd marketing that positions pic as an adult thriller. Overall B.O. should be above mid-range but not stellar for a convoluted thriller bogged down by a familiar plot and middle-aged protagonists that might not prove especially alluring to younger viewers. Top flight talent on both sides of the camera cant quite disguise the B-quality of Clark Greggs script a patchwork composed of bits and pieces from Hitchcocks suspensers the Gothic ""haunted house"" tradition ""Fatal Attraction""-like cheap thrill sensations creepy supernatural mysteries like ""The Sixth Sense"" and so on. ""What Lies Beneath"" wont restore Ford or Pfeiffer to pre-eminence. On the one hand the old-fashioned material is inferior to their talents while on the other its not spooky or stylish enough to become a must-see for the goodtimes-hungry summer masses.First act is an unabashed reworking of ""Rear Window"" with a gender reversal. Norman and Claire Spencer (Ford and Pfeiffer) move to a picturesque house near a Vermont lake after sending their daughter to college. As soon as they settle down Claire begins to suspect that theres something wrong with their neighbors Warren and Mary Feur (James Remar and Miranda Otto). Behind a fence that divides the two estates she hears vocal arguments then painful cries. Like Jimmy Stewart in Hitchcocks classic shes glued to her window with spectacles soon beginning to fear that Warren has murdered his wife. Norman whos totally consumed with his research project and upcoming conference dismisses her reports. With too much time on her hands Claire wanders around the ominous house. Before long she begins to hear whispering voices and see objects that are unexplainable soon convincing herself that the house which belonged to Normans scientist father is haunted by ghosts. Again dismissing Claires anxieties as figments of her imagination Norman sends her to see a psychiatrist (Joe Morton) who also doubts her tales. In a problematic sequence that lacks much credibility an angry Claire accuses Warren of murdering his wife at a public function attended by Normans notable peers only to realize that his wife is there. The movie then drops the Hitchcockian subplot -- which proves to be a teaser -- and turns into a supernatural mystery revolving around a lone woman in a haunted house. Some humor is integrated into the proceedings by the presence of Claires cynical divorcee friend Jody (a splendid Diana Scarwid) in scenes in which the two discuss witchcraft and try to communicate with ghosts on a Ouija board. Changing gears again third chapter centers on Claires discovery that her husband had an affair with a girl who is missing. Working as a private eye she conducts an obsessive investigation to discover the girls whereabouts including a visit to the girls distressed mother. In these segments plot makes good use of a necklace worn by the girl and found by Claire. Once Norman confesses to his adultery story turns into a kind of ""Fatal Attraction"" with the hubbys past errors and present lies plaguing the couples balance. Centering on the spouses battle for survival the final reel which is completely silent assumes the contours of a horror picture with all the genres visual cliches. Mostly set in the bathroom passage is merely the latest of many film sequences to offer allusion to the famous shower scene in ""Psycho."" Possibly no thriller has made such extensive use of water both indoors and outdoors. Occasionally the tangled plot finds interesting ways to disclose crucial events of the past. Gradually we learn that Claire was involved in a mysterious car accident the circumstances of which she barely remembers; that Norman suffers from a father complex; that Claire was a musician whose first husband died leaving her the responsibility of raising their daughter. Nonetheless women might find the films subtext offensive Claire a talented cellist gave up her career entirely just three months after meeting Norman and neighbor Mary is so consumed with love that when her hubby leaves for work she goes into unbearable flights of hysterics. All along the feeling is that the filmmakers dont trust the core material and try to compensate with a complicated storyline and overbaked production. Zemeckis best known for combining storytelling skills and technical wizardry (""Back to the Future"" ""Forrest Gump"" ""Contact"") operates on a new turf directing a thriller for the first time. Helmer succeeds in creating a swirl of Hitchcockian suspense which means that you can expect a nasty fright every time a door opens a shock when the family dog appears out of nowhere a scare when a bathtub gets filled with water with no human presence in sight and so on. But something is amiss Sophisticated technology cant substitute for intriguing characters which are lacking here. Though he gets star billing Ford actually plays a supporting role -- hes hardly present in the first hour. Ford employs his customary ""Rock of Gibraltar"" strength but despite twists and turns his role isnt particularly rewarding. Credibly cast as his vulnerable wife Pfeiffer almost succeeds in holding the picture together with her beautiful presence. However what both stars desperately need is help from a larger more colorful gallery of secondary characters -- pic is vastly underpopulated particularly in its second half. Tech credits are high grade especially widescreen lensing by Zemeckis longtime collaborator Don Burgess which keeps things fluid during the numerous house-bound scenes. There are notable trick shots within tight and confined spaces good use of multiple mirrors that both reflect and distort Claires reality and long takes that allow the actors to develop a scene organically. Echoing motifs of Bernard Herrmanns music for Hitchcock Alan Silvetsris score contributes effectively to the menacing atmosphere.
