Its a talky imitation DeMille -- no sex little action but plenty of intrigues treachery  and comeuppance.The movie was adapted from the Tommy Tenney-Mark Andrew Olsen novel based on the Bibles Book of Esther. Its a Jews-in-exile tale of a girl (Tiffany Dupont) who hides her Hebrew identity when she is taken into the harem of the Persian king Xerxes (Luke Goss). Once there she enchants him with stories of her race and falls for him. And then duty calls.Theres a backstory -- an ancient blood feud between the Jews and the Agagites whom the Jews almost wiped out. Peter OToole is the prophet Samuel who orders that genocide in an opening flashback. A descendant of the ``child-sacrificing"" Agagites Haman (James Callis) is captain of the palace guards and bent on avenging his people . Hes scheming with a malevolent prince (John Noble ) against a peace-preaching prince (Omar Sharif).The producers have burdened the story with chat sanitized the harem and stripped almost all the sexuality from the tale. Dupont has a winsome screen presence but she and Goss dont really click. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

Pic has a much broader appeal than earlier product produced by Gener8Xion and conceivably could attract ticketbuyers who have ignored other recent pics aimed primarily at devout churchgoers. Blessed with abundant production values and a minimum of campy excess ""One Night With the King"" is a surprisingly satisfying attempt to revive the Old Hollywood tradition of lavishly appointed Biblical epics aimed at mainstream auds. Pic has a much broader appeal than earlier product produced by Gener8Xion Entertainment (""The Omega Code"" ""Carman The Champion"") and conceivably could attract ticketbuyers who have ignored other recent pics aimed primarily at devout churchgoers. Indeed even a few diehard non-believers may be won over by the considerable charisma of top-billed newcomer Tiffany Dupont. Strictly speaking pics source material isnt Holy Scripture but rather a historical novel -- ""Hadassah"" by Tommy Tenney and Mark Andrew Olsen -- based on the Book of Esther. Even so scripter Stephan Blinn sticks fairly close to the original divinely inspired scenario while tracing the rise of an orphaned Jewish peasant girl who becomes the wife of King Xerxes of Persia. Hadassah (Dupont) an appealingly spirited gamine was adopted by her uncle Mordecai (John Rhys-Davies) a dutiful scribe to King Xerxes (Luke Goss) in the capital city of Susa. Fortuitously -- or perhaps more accurately miraculously -- Hadassah is in the right place at the right time when an angry Xerxes banishes his prideful wife and sends his minions throughout the land to abduct worthy candidates to be the new queen. Mordecai suggests his niece keep her Jewish heritage a secret if she is seized -- which of course she is -- and enhances the imposture by re-naming her Esther. All in all a good career move. Esther immediately stands out in the eyes Hagai (Tommy ""Tiny"" Lister) the kings chief eunuch. Hagai befriends the young woman and takes steps to ensure Xerxes will be equally impressed. He is. Esther becomes queen just in time to impede the progress of two conspirators -- Prince Admantha (John Noble) a sly fox with designs on the throne and Hamen (James Callis) a dark schemer with a long-standing grievance against Jews. Prince Memucan (Omar Sharif) a loyal member of the court plays a major role in undermining Admantha. But Hamen very nearly launches a program to exterminate all Jews in the kingdom before Esther is able to open Xerxes eyes to his treachery. Helmer Michael O. Sajbel occasionally pushes too hard especially when he bedecks Hamen with a swastika-like herald to underscore the plotters anti-Semitism. (Fortunately the obviousness of the symbolism doesnt mar Callis effective performance.) And as often happens in this sort of epic characters are given to flowery flights of speechifying. However the well-cast players infuse even borderline-campy dialogue with persuasive conviction. Sharif in a small but key role sounds aptly impassioned when he asks ""Is the past so mighty that we must destroy of brethren to escape its grasp?"" And the mountainous Lister conveys a ineffably teddy-bearish likeability as he rumbles lines -- ""You think a eunuch cannot know love?"" -- that would choke most other actors. Despite his prominent billing Peter OToole appears in only one scene -- with a nicely explosive flash of righteous fury -- as the prophet Samuel. As Esther/Hadassah Dupont exudes charm grace and (when necessary) gravitas along with a hint of incipient star power. Goss is appropriately regal Rhys-Davies is heartily formidable. Noble slices the ham generously as the hiss-worthy is Admantha. Filmed on location in India ""One Night With the King"" maintains a steady but never stodgy pace while flaunting an opulence that belies its reported 20 million budget.
