This was the premise of one of 2006s most mirthless comedies the formulaic ""RV."" As if to prove that God is in the details along comes ""Little Miss Sunshine."" Same premise. Totally different results. This indie a sweet tart and smart satire about a family of losers in a world obsessed with winning is an authentic crowd pleaser. Theres been no more satisfying American comedy this year.Greg Kinnear plays the gratingly optimistic dad of the Hoover clan a motivational speaker with a 9-step program for success that nobody seems to want. Toni Collette is the mom desperate to keep her fractured clan together. This is not easy when your son (Paul Dano) an en-raged alienated Nietzsche-reading teenager has taken a vow of total silence and your brother (Steve Carell) a suicidal Proust scholar has just been let out of the hospital after his boyfriend jilted him. Adding to the havoc is potty-mouthed drug-snorting Grandpa (Alan Arkin) a diehard hedonist who has nothing but contempt for his sons rah-rah philosophy. The youngest is 7-year-old Olive (Abigail Breslin) a sweet plump ungainly girl who dreams of competing in the surreally sexualized ""Little Miss Sunshine"" preteen beauty contest. This spurs the entire family to hit the road to California in their run-down VW bus.These are juicy roles and the sterling cast makes the most of them meshing into a wonderfully eccentric ensemble. The perfect casting continues down the line to the short-tempered hospital ""bereavement liaison"" memorably played by Paula Newsome. Screenwriter Michael Arendt and the husband-and-wife directing team of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris bring the Hoovers to life with swift psychologically astute strokes and precise comic timing. Remarkably this is his first screenplay and their first feature. ""Little Miss Sunshine"" won both the audience and critics awards at Sundance this year. Thats usually the kiss of death too feel-good Sundance phenoms fizzled in the real world. (Anybody remember ""Happy Texas""? ""The Spitfire Grill""?) This ones the real deal. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week CorrectionIn ""A Busload of Losers"" (July 24) we misspelled the name of Michael Arndt the screenwriter of ""Little Miss Sunshine"" and incorrectly reported that the movie won both critics and audience awards at Sundance.

Rolling through the great outdoors bickering as they go what the wife and kids dont know is that all this is part of dads stealth plan to make an important business meeting in Colorado. The audience is supposed to be sympathetic because the poor schmucks desperately trying to maintain their comfortable lifestyle yet bourgeois anxiety here plays an essentially supporting role to routine slapstick. The blocked toilet pump the handbrake that doesnt work all the usual suspects. What are the likes of once-hip director Barry Sonnenfeld and an increasingly crinkly Williams doing in a virtual remake of National Lampoons Vacation (minus the cruel granny action)? Merely ticking over in the hope their careers hit an upturn one imagines. Actually its not unbearably terrible just thoroughly mediocre and the truly heroic Jeff Daniels warrants a smile as the dauntingly cheery hick paterfamilias encountered on the road.

In fact the face of Irv is supplied by the movies director Barry Sonnenfeld. And the look of outsized huckster idiocy the man who made Men In Black sports as a stressed-out high-income L.A. family of four motors east to Colorado sums up everything unnecessarily braying about this group-healing-through-fecal-sightgags adventure. Somewhere in the project (with a script by The Shaggy Dogs Geoff Rodkey and a cast that includes Robin Williams Jeff Daniels and the 24/7 caffeinated Kristin Chenoweth) is a mildly goofball essentially conservative midlife appreciation of health togetherness and good American fortune. But an addiction to antics and gags many of them involving Daniels and Chenoweth as full-time RVers makes it difficult for a viewer to smell the roses between jokes involving mad raccoons and strange-looking fellow Americans from the part of America thats not L.A. And as Williams ricochets between playing submissive soft-drink executive tethered to the whims of a hysterical boss (Arrested Developments Will Arnett who better?) and pathetic dad at the wheel trying to cajole his family into vacation satisfaction we can be excused for getting carsick.

Bringing new meaning -- if not new heights of hilarity -- to the concept of a Robin Williams vehicle Sony/Columbias ""RV"" works up an ingratiating sweetness that partially compensates for its blunt predictability and meager laughs. With Williams relatively subdued as a father trying to keep spirits high during the worst family vacation ever this Barry Sonnenfeld-directed road-trip romp looks more like a station wagon than a Winnebago B.O.-wise though the actors lengthy absence from the comic mainstream should ensure a solid opening. As he did to considerably more manic effect in 1993s ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" Williams plays a resourceful paterfamilias whose scheming is ostensibly an outgrowth of genuine love for his family. His Bob Munro is a high-paid exec at a Los Angeles soda conglomerate enabling him to provide a comfortable lifestyle but have little quality time for his yuppie wife Jamie (""Curb Your Enthusiasms"" Cheryl Hines) short-fused daughter Cassie (Joanna ""JoJo"" Levesque) and pint-sized but macho son Carl (Josh Hutcherson). When his sleazy boss (Will Arnett) forces him to cancel the familys Hawaii vacation to seal a deal with a Colorado-based beverage company Bob rather than level with his family rents a tanklike motor home and insists that a road trip is exactly what they need. His wife and kids are thoroughly exasperated by this implausible turn of events (a feeling that may well be shared by the audience) and Geoff Rodkeys screenplay lays on the disgruntled bickering very thick in the early going. Cassie in particular displays enough attitude for three hormonal teenagers her sarcastic dialogue sounding unnecessarily harsh even when the trip takes a turn as it must for the worst. In addition to being green and spectacularly hideous the lumbering vehicle comes equipped with faulty brakes -- a setback that causes it to roll away at inopportune moments thus accounting for roughly half the films store of jokes. Script soon reaches its gross-out nadir in a mirthlessly protracted sequence that finds Bob trying to empty the RVs septic tank. Pic improves significantly with the introduction of another traveling family composed of Travis Gornicke (Jeff Daniels) his wife Mary Jo (a delightful Kristin Chenoweth) and their endearingly gawky children (Hunter Parrish Chloe Sonnenfeld and Alex Ferris). Thoroughly turned off by this gregarious Southern clan their intrusive hospitality and their penchant for group yodeling the Munros try to distance themselves as much as possible. Yet rather than reduce them to homespun caricatures pic wisely holds up the Gornickes as a refreshing counterexample of a family that is functional guileless and devoid of materialism. While this doesnt up the laugh factor by much it does steer ""RV"" into more mature emotionally grounded territory. As Bob labors to maintain his deception -- even feigning gastrointestinal distress during a nature hike so he can sneak off to a business meeting -- a lesson about the meaning of family and sticking it to the Man looms large on the horizon. Fortunately helmer Sonnenfeld (the ""Men in Black"" movies ""Get Shorty"") has good schmaltz antennae and keeps the sap to a minimum here. Save for one out-of-nowhere gangsta-riff monologue this is one of Williams least shtick-reliant performances; at some points thesp has the unusual role of playing the straight man to the more boisterous Daniels. Supporting cast is strong including Levesque and Hutcherson whose appeals extend past the superficial sullenness of their roles. But the real scene-stealer is Chenoweth here displaying the same effortless sparkle and bracing warmth that made her such a Broadway luminary. Fred Murphys lush widescreen lensing showcasing wooded British Columbia locales standing in for Colorado to often dazzling effect is the chief standout of a strong tech package.

That title would refer less to the quality of the film -- which is unfunny sappy and massively predictable -- but to its obsession with fecal matter. A majority of the jokes in this family-focused gag guzzler center on bathroom humor. Is that what clueless Hollywood honchos think families want to bond over? Why Robin Williams would choose a leaden vehicle like RV for his latest starring role is not really worth pondering. He has made his share of clunkers of late. But what was Jeff Daniels thinking when he signed on particularly after his turn in The Squid and the Whale was so subtle and haunting? Williams wife (Cheryl Hines) daughter (JoJo Levesque) and son (Josh Hutcherson) would much rather vacation in Hawaii but dad rents a garish RV for a trip to the Rockies. At first the bratty kids and even the mother band together to mock Dad and his crazy notions of fun. They also try to ditch a load of overly friendly musical camping nomads led by Daniels and Kristin Chenoweth. But shockingly enough these apparent simpletons have a lesson to teach Williams fractured family. If originality is what you seek take a pass on RV. All twists can be seen for miles ahead.

"Robin Williams RV reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Robin Williams RV reviewed. Robin Williams RV reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.April 28 2006 126 PM How I Spent My Miserable Vacation Robin Williams in his latest disaster RV. By Grady Hendrix Robin Williams in RV Faces disfigured with boredom gaze dully out over blasted landscapes. Septic hoses drip fecal matter onto the body of a middle-aged man. The sun blasts an anonymous flat landscape interrupted only by rundown bars and empty campsites. Welcome to the world of RV (Columbia Pictures) the latest Robin Williams movie directed by Barry Sonnenfeld. Premiering out of competition at the Tribeca Film Festival it is set to open this weekend and its bleak dissection of middle-class angst and emotional death is guaranteed to shock audiences some of whom might even cry. Robin Williams plays Bob Munro an emotionally crippled family man who is locked in a master/slave relationship with his boss (Will Arnett from Arrested Development). When his job is threatened Williams has no choice but to cancel his familys vacation to Hawaii and instead con them into taking a vacation in an RV to Colorado where he will secretly make a presentation to a small soda company that his corporation is purchasing. Williams family is shattered numbing themselves with alcohol pills pop music and powerlifting. His wife (Cheryl Hines from Curb Your Enthusiasm) is a brittle woman whose large teeth and emaciated frame paint her as the personification of sterility. His children are Cassie (played by the singer known only as JoJo) and Carl (Josh Hutcherson). Cassie seems to be eternally angry with her father who used to entertain her with sock puppets but now spends all his hours hunched over his laptop. Carl looks like a small boy and is obsessed with powerlifting but as it is later revealed in the film he is actually much older than he appears and suffers from a condition that makes him appear prepubescent. Advertisement These emotionally deadened zombies are loaded into the RV against their will and head for Colorado. But as they leave the blue-state edges of the country for the red-state center the film turns dark. The red states are populated with menacing grotesques particularly the hyper-sexualized Gornicke clan led by Jeff Daniels who dresses like Heath Ledger in Brokeback Mountain and uses every opportunity to cuddle hold squeeze and hug Robin Williams. And feces begin to drip like something in a Cronenberg film. Barry Sonnenfeld has always told stories about outsiders making their way in a new world but in RV he tells a story about doo-doo. The film is covered in it. The Munro familys RV is nicknamed ""the big rolling turd"" and the male characters constantly talk about using the bathroom to ""launch an ICBM."" An early set piece is concerned with draining the RVs septic tank an exercise that draws an audience and ends with Williams humiliated and soaked in yellow liquefied excrement before Daniels hoses him off with special attention paid to hosing off Williams crotch. Later in the movie Williams will feign diarrhea to escape to his business meeting and he spends many scenes sitting on the toilet while using his laptop. Slobber chewed food brains and liquefied human fat also make unpleasant appearances. But here the film inverts the Deliverance formula The more the Munros are covered in feces the more they seem to enjoy it. As they move toward the ripe fertile center of the country they come alive. As their gleaming RV becomes more and more decrepit they reconnect with their own essential selves until finally they pass through a suggestive mud flume and come out on the other side dirty caked with mud and streaked with other less pleasant substances. Immediately they adjourn to a bar and get drunk enjoying each others bodies and souls for the first time. Strangely such a film does not seem to be aimed at children. At the Tribeca screening the adults watched appalled and fascinated to see their emotional lives portrayed in such visceral hideous detail while the children ran up and down the aisles and asked me for Mamp;Ms. A few slept. Scatologically obsessed grim shockingly sexualized RV is another disturbing entry in the dark cycle of movies that began for Robin Williams with One Hour Photo and Insomnia and has continued with The Night Listener. I look forward with queasy dread to what hell do in Mrs. Doubtfire 2. Grady Hendrix is one of the founders of the New York Asian Film Festival and he writes about pop culture on his blog.

Dads taking you on a long long ride. 1 / 1 Back to Gallery RV Comedy. Starring Robin Williams Cheryl Hines Joanna ""JoJo"" Lavesque and Josh Hutcherson. Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld. (PG. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""RV"" is a horrible movie about horrible people and just because they call it a comedy doesnt mean we have to play along. The story of a family vacation gone wrong the film is constructed as a series of comic bits that dont pay off that are not only not amusing but are often disturbing. Director Barry Sonnenfeld and writer Geoff Rodkey present a poisonous vision of family life without ever quite acknowledging its poisonous. Perhaps they dont notice. At the head of this miserable family is Robin Williams as a sweet-natured husband and father of two with a good job as a business executive but his position isnt secure. So hes on shaky ground at work and on shaky ground at home as well with a dissatisfied wife (Cheryl Hines) a relatively benign son (Josh Hutcherson) and an absolutely vicious daughter (Joanna ""JoJo"" Lavesque) whod be the most evil character appearing in a film this week were it not for the release of ""United 93."" This cold description would suggest the setup for a farce a modern version of the kind of film that W.C. Fields made satirizing marriage and family and presenting an exaggerated and bleak vision of middle age. But thats not whats going on here and anyway that would be odd casting for Williams. At least with Fields you can imagine that on some level he deserves this treatment but with Williams shuffling through the movie like Giulietta Masina you know he doesnt. To get the essence of ""RV"" just picture Williams beaming with unconditional love. Then picture a teenage girl giving him the finger and Williams expression changing ever so slightly to a love mixed with wistful hope. ""RV"" presents the story of a family that goes from hating Dad to one thats willing to tolerate him -- this is what it offers as a tenderhearted journey. Its not in any way a satire and yet its vision of American family life is as damning as anything the most bitter satirist could devise. In ""RV"" the family has planned a trip to Hawaii but Dad (Williams) has to go to Colorado on a business trip or else lose his job. Afraid to tell his unloving family about this turn of events -- theyll just think hes a loser or criticize him for caring too much about business -- he cashes in the Hawaii vacation and rents a recreation vehicle presenting a camping vacation in Colorado as the ultimate in fun and togetherness. And so for the next 45 minutes of screen time the daughter does nothing but snipe at him about missing out on Hawaii. She acts as if she had a right to Hawaii or as if she had paid for the tickets herself. The rest of the movie consists of Williams crashing the RV into things and getting abused. The family is without love and without the possibility of redemption laden with possessions and obligations soulless and hostile to outsiders. This the movie considers normal. Presented as freakish is another family (headed by Jeff Daniels and Kristin Chenoweth) thats generous loving and happy. The movies jaundiced perspective would have us regard these folks as chirpy stupid and silly. Yet even allowing for the condescending treatment they come across a lot better than the protagonists. So much for Hollywood family values. Speaking of family values this film is rated PG by the MPAA an organization devoted to making sure that no child ever sees breasts until they either pop up in the mirror on their own or present themselves in the backseat of a car. But if I were running the MPAA Id put a restricted label on ""RV."" I wouldnt want kids to think they could talk to their parents like that and get away with it. -- Advisory For crude humor and innuendo and a scene in which the daughter sings the suggestive ""Cherry Bomb"" seemingly without knowing that the Joan Jett-Kim Fowley classic is 30 years old.

"RV | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; rv ) RV (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli A sample of questions that floated through this reviewers mind while watching RV... Is the name ""Big Rolling Turd"" supposed to apply to the RV or the movie? Wheres Chevy Chase when you need him? And considering all the movies not being shown to critics this year why did the studio choose this one to subject us to? Have you ever been at a party where a guy starts telling a long-winded unremarkable story? He thinks its so hilarious that he guffaws his way through it. The problem is hes the only one who thinks its funny. One or two moments might be worth a chuckle but the thing as a whole is a bore. You want nothing more than to find a reason to get away from this guy and look for someone - anyone - else to mingle with. RV is that story and Barry Sonnenfeld is the storyteller. On the strength of some of his earlier efforts (Get Shorty Men in Black) I was willing to forgive Sonnenfeld Wild Wild West and Men in Black II. But this going too far. RV is the ultimate road trip insult - a National Lampoons Vacation comedy minus the Griswolds with Robin Williams standing in for Chevy Chase. I never thought I would write something like this but Williams performance pales in comparison with what Chase might have done with the role. At the very least we wouldnt have been subjected to the saccharine ending that is becoming the trademark of every movie featuring the neutered Williams. To avoid losing his high-profile job Bob Munro (Williams) cancels his family vacation to Hawaii and instead decides to take a road trip to Colorado with his wife Jamie (Cheryl Hines) daughter Cassie (Joanna JoJo Levescue) and son Carl (Josh Hutcherson). This not coincidentally will put Bob at a destination within a few miles of the place where his boss expects him to give a vital presentation. To make the trip Bob rents an oversized RV with failed parking brakes and a stopped up sewage system. His family embarks upon the nightmare trip with little enthusiasm. After a rest stop episode with sewage and fecal matter - as apt a metaphor for the film as any - Bob meets another RV family the Gornickes - Travis (Jeff Daniels) Marie Jo (Kristin Chenoweth) Earl (Hunter Parrish) Moon (Chloe Sonnenfeld) and Billy (Alex Ferris). These five are homeless living their lives out of their bus. Their kids are home schooled and their vehicle plays the first eight notes of the Star Trek theme any time the horn is pressed. Daniels proves that you dont have to be Randy Quaid to play an annoying interloper in a bad road movie comedy. To be fair RV starts out okay. The first ten minutes contain a few mirthful lines. But the film tips its hand during a painful sequence in which Bob struggles with his seatbelt. This scene goes on forever and isnt remotely amusing. And it gets worse from there. The occasional zinger thrown out by Cassie isnt enough to overcome the toxic cloud of cinematic badness that is Geoff Rodkeys script. Then again considering his past triumphs - The Shaggy Dog and Daddy Day Care - one shouldnt be surprised at the quality of this screenplay. On those rare occasions when RV stumbles across a comedic moment that is legitimately funny it drains the humor out of it by milking it dry. RV falls into the category of movies a critic endures primarily to warn others off. Those who ignore the danger signs and plunk down their hard-earned dollars to sit through RV will quickly recognize that this is one road trip upon which theyll wish they hadnt embarked.

If this fecally coated character is likely to be played by Rob Schneider and you arent Rob Schneider fine. But if the poor slob is likely to be played by you nix the script. And fire your agent. Who recommended RV to Robin Williams is among the films many mysteries. Why he took the role is another. RV must have seemed a good idea to somebody somewhere at some time or other. Family road trips are kind of funny right? Chevy Chase the Vacation movies Aunt Edna strapped to the roof ha-ha? Arent recreational vehicles just yuk factories on wheels? Regular tin cans of hilarity -- driving on highways parking in dusty camps hooking up with yokels who sing in harmony and spill forth bosom if they have any. Plus RVs have toilets which mean sewage which means sewage dumps which mean sewage dump accidents which mean magnificent geysers of brown stuff. RV issues from the helm of Barry Sonnenfeld who directed both Men in Black movies and the first two Addams Family films and whose forte consists of extraterrestrials and dysfunctional ghouls. Its plot involves Williams as Bob a kicked-around employee of a soft-drink manufacturer whose boss (Will Arnett) threatens to fire him unless he can score the takeover of a smaller soda company. Bob agrees but it means scotching a family vacation in Hawaii for a business trip with soda honchos. Rather than explain all this to his wife (Cheryl Hines) and kids Bob runs out rents a gargantuan RV and schleps his irritated brood to Colorado encountering predictable obstacles along the way. We suffer through the seat-belt joke; the crashing-into-gates joke; the vicious-wildlife joke; the (many) failed emergency-brake jokes; the sullen teen sullen preteen meathead dad and prickly-mom jokes; the country bumpkin jokes. Many of these revolve around another RV family an upbeat Texas clan (headed by Jeff Daniels and Kristin Chenoweth) whose emphatic cheerfulness annoys the sewage out of Bobs family who are pretty annoying themselves. I wouldnt step on a bus with any of these guys. Even Williams doesnt seem his old self the usual motormouthed mania subdued by Bobs serial humiliation. He gets one scene to riff in Williamsonian ghetto patter to a group of young toughs at a basketball court. The rest of the time hes reduced to trashing the RV hanging off the RV or getting doused. Three times in the movies first half Williams says ""My bad."" But he cant shoulder all the blame for this malodorous bomb.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Barry Sonnenfeld is right There is some- thing inherently funny about a big ungainly recreational vehicle even for those who own them and love them. Can you be depressed in an RV? (OK Jack Nicholson from ""About Schmidt"" dont answer that question.) RVs are for comedy and high jinks with their surreal paint jobs and interior fabrics replicated only on Las Vegas bedspreads. In a way they rank as the ultimate portable American gadget. RV use comes with a guaranteed family story Silly things happen to good people. But Sonnenfeld as the director of ""RV"" took too much of that for granted. Knowing RVs are funny he forgot to find a script that proved it. ""RV"" begins with promising sarcasm and biting laughs then slips the emergency brake and careens downhill into a forgettable montage of manufactured crises and teachable moments. In the script by Geoff Rodkey (""Daddy Day Care"") Robin Williams is a Pasadena dad beset by a cruel boss and children who are indifferent at best abusive at worst. A summer vacation in Hawaii should heal all wounds until Williams boss orders him to Boulder a week hence to lead an important sales pitch. To preserve the illusion of vacation Williams rents a garish RV and points it toward the Rocky Mountains. Wife Cheryl Hines response RVs are for friendly people and ""Honey try to remember were not friendly."" Daughter Joanna Levesques response ""Why dont we just stay home and set fire to an oil field?"" Williams is not the wrong choice to captain this gas-guzzling ship. His aura of barely controlled rage mixed with maudlin familial affection sets everyone on edge. Sonnenfelds mistake was surrounding Williams with relative lightweights and failing to take advantage of the real acting talent he did sign - people like Jeff Daniels. Rodkeys script muzzles its bite somewhere in Utah. Its hard for family-travel movies like ""RV"" to shake the friendly ghost of Randy Quaid in the National Lampoon farces. Quaid was the model for a foil who brought eccentricity inspired stupidity and near- hysteria to the folding card table of life. Here the wide-ranging talents of Daniels (from ""The Squid and the Whale"" to ""Dumb and Dumber"") seem locked in the luggage compartment for fear of overshadowing Williams. Not that Im automatically against extended sequences involving bathroom humor. ""Meet the Fockers"" spent a lot of time in and around the RV toilet and joke writers cant seem to resist the crude fact that in a mobile home Americans finally have to spend some time confronting their own waste. Be forewarned This ""RV"" family handles pipes full of poo for a good 10 minutes at a moonscape campground built to resemble the scorched ground of Nevada. And its one of the better sequences in the film as a supportive crowd of fellow RVers gathers in lawn chairs to watch the show of the Munro family trying desperately to dump sewage down the appropriate hole. Sonnenfeld had succeeded at comedy high and low with a classic like ""Get Shorty"" and crowd-pleasers like ""Men in Black."" The problem in ""RV"" is not that the comedy is low - I appreciate a well-timed groin-kick more than most critics - but that its so inconsistent. If an RV is going to make us feel mean then by all means drive that sucker all the way to Kenosha and back. Dont ask me to believe the 15-year- old girl with the meanest mouth in the West is redeemed by one 10-mile hike into the wilderness. In my experience a long hike is a good way to turn a harmless teenager into a potential felon. Please dont schedule a family hug before we get a bar fight with the local Harley club; and dont give Dad an epiphany before you give him a colonoscopy and Mom runs off with a park ranger.

"RV heads down the same old road - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW RV heads down the same old road By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  April 28 2006 Faithful readers of this space know how I feel about the Dopey Daddy stereotype that stumbles its way through commercials sitcoms and movies like Cheaper by the Dozen."" Life isnt hard enough for us guys without this pernicious cliche coming in for ritual humiliation from the media? Does Hollywood think we enjoy being painted as clueless mouth-breathers mocked by sassy knowing wives and painfully hip kids? Wheres the respect? Wheres the love? Its as big a mystery as where the moms go in Disney cartoons.In RV"" the broad-as-a-mobile-home new comedy from of all people Barry Sonnenfeld (Men in Black"" Get Shorty"") Robin Williams gives us a Dopey Dad for the ages. His character a corporate executive and suburban father named Bob Munro lies to his family grovels whines sputters shrieks sweats and purses his lips in that familiar expression of Williams Agonistes. His blue eyes water with the pain of castration administered on a daily basis. Is Bob mourning his trapped life or Williams his stalled career? Whatever the performance might be art if the movie werent such by-the-numbers offal.The Munros -- Bob wife Jamie (Cheryl Hines of Curb Your Enthusiasm"" snotty/trampy teen daughter Cassie (Joanna Levesque whom your kids know as the singer JoJo) thug tweener son Carl (Josh Hutcherson Zathura"") -- are looking forward to a vacation in Hawaii but Bobs boss played with twitchy Type-A neurosis by Will Arnett of Arrested Development"" lowers the boom Be in Colorado for the big merger meeting or youre fired.Without telling the family Bob switches plans and rents a recreational vehicle the size of Rhode Island -- everyone pile in for a cross-country bonding experience The results play like National Lampoons Vacation"" with a holding tank of excrement and a lot less nerve.As written by Geoff Rodkey (Daddy Day Care"" The Shaggy Dog"") RV"" is a Murphys Law movie Everything that can go wrong very quickly does. The vehicle coasts backward at will and is promptly dubbed The Rolling Turd"" (which prompted the child two seats away from me to ask his father Daddy whats a turd?"" -- these are precious moments folks). The septic tank clogs and erupts covering Bob in poo; I could work up a metaphor here but its just too easy. There are raccoons in the oven. Worse there are hicks in the RV camps in particular the way-too-friendly Gornickes Travis (Jeff Daniels) Marie Jo (Kristen Chenoweth) and their three kids.Like most modern comedies RV"" is paralyzed between ridiculing the Gornickes and worshiping them as the salt of the earth. (Vacation"" settled for ridicule and was impressively mean.) The movie asks us to laugh at these blue-collar mutants while putting up with Bob and his loathsome pampered brood then trowels on feel-good reconciliation at the end and expects us to buy it. In a way RV"" is as spineless as its hero.Still the relentless litany of disaster gets some giggles. Sonnenfeld uses dry timing to play against the grain of slapstick -- this is a director who learned his trade shooting Coen brothers movies after all -- and Williams seems game for just about anything. The sequence in which Bob drives his behemoth over a mountain road and gets stuck teetering like a compass needle at the top is pulled off with the verve of an old Road Runner"" cartoon.There are family moments that sting too the scene where Jamie Cassie and Carl all plug in their iPods and sing separate songs at peak volume while Bob drives miserably on is a wickedly jaundiced snapshot of the modern American family upper-middle-class division. RV"" has teeth -- more teeth than the last few Steve Martin films anyway -- but its terrified to bite down knowing that the paying audience would feel it more than anyone. The movie hints that Dopey Dads may be silly but that the alternatives -- Psycho Dad Despairing Dad Suicidal Dad -- are too painful to consider.

"Robin Williamss RV No Were Not There Yet washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Robin Williamss RV No Were Not There Yet Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday April 28 2006 In recent memory and the shudders havent stopped yet we have seen Steve Martin (in ""Cheaper by the Dozen 2"") and Cedric the Entertainer (in ""Johnson Family Vacation"") as beleaguered middle-aged fathers gamely leading sullen families into summer vacations. After watching ""RV"" in which Robin Williams plays yet another father taking his wife and kids to Colorado in yes a long recreational vehicle we noted some commonalities that have emerged from all three films. We couldnt help but notice . . . A This is always the familys last gasp -- it wont be long before the kids are too old for collective family pursuits. A The children start off with no relationship with Dad; they end up practically living out ""Field of Dreams"" with him. A These movies are all terrible. Williams is Bob Munro who has agreed to cancel his Hawaiian vacation so he can complete a presentation for his boss. But instead of fessing all to his wife Jamie (Cheryl Hines) he tells her hes decided to take the family on a road trip from their Los Angeles home to the Rockies by RV. Bob figures he can get the work done behind his wifes back and still give the family (including Josh Hutcherson and JoJo) a bonding holiday. Although Williams peppers his screen time with trademark jokes (completely inappropriate for his character) the real ""comedy"" occurs as he tries to navigate that unwieldy rig and also tries to keep a step ahead of the Gornickes a terminally cheery family from Texas (cue red-state/blue-state cultural clashes) led by good-natured patriarch Travis (Jeff Daniels) his wife Marie Jo (Kristin Chenoweth) and their three kids. Will Bob get that presentation done? Will the family bond? Will the Munros and the Gornickes achieve harmonic appreciation? How many times do we have to watch that RV sideswipe signposts? More questions Why did director Barry Sonnenfeld take on this project? Just to sully a fine comedic resume that includes ""The Addams Family"" and ""Get Shorty""? And one last one Which one of these levers do you pull to send the RV careering off the mountain for good? RV (98 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for crude humor sexual innuendo and profanity.
