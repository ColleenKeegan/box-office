A 70s-style political conspiracy thriller outfitted with contempo action techno gear ""Shooter"" is a brawny loner-against-a-duplicitous-government suspenser that asserts its own personality despite adherence to genre specifications. An immediately involving yarn of an ace Marine sharpshooter set up to take the fall for an attempted presidential assassination pic saddles itself with stereotypical villains hokey contrivances and too-expedient crisis solutions. But its skeptical disillusioned take on big government and official deceptions should strike a vibrant chord with a wide range of audiences as will the ample serving of dramatic just desserts resulting in potent B.O. in all markets. Among other things ""Shooter"" provides one answer to the oft-asked question of who can replace the aging action stars of the 80s and 90s. Following up his tangy turn in ""The Departed"" Mark Wahlberg easily fills shoes that once would have been worn by Sylvester Stallone or Bruce Willis. Hes got the focused determination the street smarts and the bod; hes aged enough now to have cast off the juvenile callowness and as an actor he clearly understands the Gary Cooper principle that less is usually more for a stoical hero in such fare. Adapting Washington Post film critic Stephen Hunters novel ""Point of Impact"" the first entry in a trilogy featuring military sniper Bob Lee Swagger scenarist Jonathan Lemkin stirs in recognizable ingredients from ""The Parallax View"" ""The Day of the Jackal"" ""Seven Days in May"" and ""Three Days of the Condor"" feeding on and encouraging suspicion of nefarious deeds and dastardly motives among men in high places. In a nine-minute Horn of Africa prologue Swagger (Wahlberg) is seen doing what he does best picking off enemies from a great distance in a clandestine operation. When his partner is killed and opposition forces gather however the Marines clear out and abandon the marksman to fend for himself. Its just the first of many occasions when hell be asked to do so and never does the slightest doubt arise that hell be up to the task. Three years later Swagger is ensconced in a Wyoming mountain cabin with his dog and firearms; when he goes online to survey the days news and mutters ""Lets see what lies theyre trying to sell us today"" its unclear whether hes turned into Jeremiah Johnson or the Unabomber. But when a vaguely defined Washington insider retired Col. Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover) comes to call he soon finds Swaggers Achilles heel patriotism. Intelligence suggests the president is about to be the target of a long-distance assassination attempt and Johnson insists only Swagger can deduce the would-be killers plans. Cementing his appeal for audiences on the left and then the right Swagger replies ""I dont like the president much. I didnt like the one before"" then reluctantly agrees to help reconnoitering public places in D.C. Baltimore and Philly before deducing Independence Hall will be the location for the attack. When the shooting goes awry and another official is killed all fingers have been prearranged to point at Swagger who slips through one tight spot after another with every cop in the country on his tail. Instructing the audience in diverse injury survival skills along the way he eventually finds sanctuary at the old Kentucky home of his late buddys former g.f. Sarah (Kate Mara). Sarahs a lonely hottie and her rather too extreme allure suddenly yanks focus to other matters. It also reps just the first of numerous improbabilities among them Swaggers ever-ready vigilance in the face of attack and the stock villainy of clandestine government nasties. Even after more than 40 years a director should never put an evil foreign-accented government schemer (played here by Rade Sherbedgia) into a wheelchair and expect not to summon unwanted comparisons to ""Dr. Strangelove."" Likewise Elias Koteas slimy goon all but drools when he gets his hands on Sarah and Ned Beattys right-wing senator has in every way been made to resemble a certain vice president with questionable riflery skills. All the same Lemkin and helmer Antoine Fuqua have constructed such a taut tale around a man so unfairly scorned by his superiors that one can scarcely help but develop a deep rooting interest. Most crucial factor in the films success is the conception of the Swagger character; he represents the classic American individualist of the sort one sees less and less of both onscreen and in real life a dont-tread-on-me patriot a cowboy loner whos only dangerous when crossed. Anyone with a healthy libertarian streak will embrace the entirely non-partisan way Swagger takes on an overgrown political apparatus. During a ""One-Eyed Jacks""-like second act in which Swagger bides his time while recovering from injuries centerstage is shared by young FBI agent Nick Memphis (Michael Pena). Memphis dares to question the party line on what went down in Independence Square an attitude quietly encouraged by a sultry bureau cohort (Rhona Mitra). Arriving in the middle of all this is a show-stopping one-scene cameo by Levon Helm as an aged Southern firearms expert who guides the hero through esoteric realms of ammunition history. By the time its over Swagger has taken down countless well-armed men in Ramboesque one-man-army style on his way to dealing with the big shots they protect. In any future Swagger installments though the bad guys will know better than to mess with his dog. Fuqua and his team serve the action straight up with no frills and a potent punch. British Columbian locations including spectacular mountaintops in the Whistler area stand in for settings as diverse as Montana and East Africa although actual Philly and D.C. locations are used where they count. All behind-the-scenes contributions are strong. Shooter ProductionA Paramount release of a Di Bonaventura Pictures production. Produced by Lorenzo Di Bonaventura Ric Kidney.

A former crack Marine sniper hung out to dry during an illegal mission in Ethiopia he finds three years on that dark forces at the heart of government have got it in for him personally. Lured from his sun-dappled Unabomber-style mountain retreat - where he bonds with his dog bones up on 9/11 and services a colossal personal armoury - by a shady CIA colonel (Danny Glover) who insists hes the only man able to foil a plot on the Presidents life Swagger soon finds himself the target of a massive manhunt with only his late buddys girl (Kate Mara) and a discredited rookie Fed (Michael Pena) willing to give him the time of day. In the Line of Fire meets The Fugitive then and for a while they get on rather well. Wahlberg is engaging the script pacy and director Antoine Fuqua (Training Day Tears of the Sun) has a sure grasp of the best three angles from which to cover a high-speed car chase or slow-motion fireball of which theres no shortage. That the characters and dialogue are cliched is no great surprise but the films weird thin politics become harder to swallow as it lurches from set-up to set-up anti-establishment social righteousness marches in step with man-alone isolationism; self-serving militarism is lambasted while automatic weaponry is slobbered over; and limbs crack and heads pop all the while. Its a funny kind of patriotism that so utterly disdains institutions.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review A Terrible Thing to Waste The Lookout is a nifty neurological thriller that only goes brain-dead at the end. Plus Adam Sandlers 9/11 movie. By David Edelstein Published Oct 25 2007 ShareThis Illustration by Paul Willoughby  (Photo Allen Fraser/Courtesy of Miramax Films) Chris Pratt played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt is the perfect patsy-hero for the crafty little minor-key thriller The Lookout a young man who has sinned in his own eyes and is also brain-damagedcompromised both morally and neurologically. When we first see him hes Slapshot Pratt a high-school rich-kid hockey star whos so certain of his indestructibility that he sails along a Midwest country road sans headlights the better to show off all the fireflies (theyre mating) to his girlfriend his buddy and his buddys girlfriendtwo of whom dont survive the subsequent collision. Now he spends his days at an independent life skills center and his nights as a janitor at a small bank where hell never have the cognitive function to rise to the level of teller. Sometimes I cry for no reason he writes in the journal he keeps in the battle to make sense of his life. The Lookout is the directing debut of the screenwriter Scott Frank (Out of Sight Minority Report) who reportedly wrote the script years agowell before Memento in which a brain injury plays havoc with both the protagonists short-term memory and the movies syntax. For those with a taste for neo-noir it might be disappointing that Chriss handicap doesnt generate seismic spatial-temporal dislocations. Franks ambitions are comparatively modest to deliver a nice tight genre piece with people you like watching so much that you barely feel the directors squeeeeze until you suddenly cant breathe. The forlorn Chris finds himself befriended at a bar by Gary Spargo (Matthew Goode) and a babe who calls herself Luvlee (the luscious Isla Fisher). Gary was a big fan of his high-school hockey playing Luvlee was such a big fan she cant believe shes kissing Slapshot Pratt The poor pratI mean Prattis the easiest bank-employee mark imaginable. Gordon-Levitt is a major tabula rasa actor. Its simpler to say what he doesnt do wronganythingthan what he does right. As in Mysterious Skin and Brick hes a minimalist no fuss no placards no Method sense-memory exercises. You dont catch him playing brain-damaged. You know his Chris is in chaos by the way he doesnt seize the space by what he takes away from the character. His feelings run deepest when that rubber face goes slack. Gordon-Levitt is a great re-actor and he bounces off some barnstormers here. As his intemperate blind roommate Lewis nice-guy-actor Jeff Daniels gets to wallow in the head of another self-righteous jerk (the last one was in The Squid and the Whale) and Danielss relish for playing a man with a chip on his shoulder the size of a tractor and nothing left to lose makes you love the character beyond reason. In Match Point Matthew Goode played Jonathan Rhys Meyerss mysteriously welcoming upper-class tennis partnermysteriously because Goode couldnt help but give the character an impish subtext as if some skeezy punch line were coming (except that Woody Allen forgot to write it). In The Lookout hes playing an American but the wiles are entertainingly English Its that mocking sinceritythat ironic fatuous niceness. Goodes Gary is just the friendliest guy Hes seductive even when you know where the movie is headingand when the editor Jill Savitt steals a beat from his close-ups to give you subliminal willies. Its almost a relief when the double entendres stop and Gary shows his true feral colors. Franks writing is razor-sharp his filmmaking whistle-clean. As a fan of sharp razors and clean whistles I enjoyed The Lookoutyet I did feel let down by the climax which ought to have been blunter and messier and crazier and more cathartic. It sounds churlish I know but a thriller with a hero like Gordon-Levitts Chris should be more of an act of sympathetic imagination. The payoff needed to be more brain-damaged. Reign Over Me is the rare studio film with the fullness of a novela novel that reels and overreaches and never finds its footing. The writer and director Mike Binder (The Upside of Anger) brings his screwball-sitcom temperament to a fictional premise that would stagger our most ruminative tragedian. Five years after the death of his wife and three daughters in one of the planes that crashed into the World Trade Center Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) remains in a state of extreme denialhe seems more brain-damaged than the hero of The Lookout. Whizzing around Manhattan on a scooter hes hailed by Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle) his college roommate and dental-school chum. While Alan recalls their relationship Charlie nods politely (Cool cool) and then prepares to go on his way. He doesnt want to remember anything. In some ways Charlie isnt a stretch for Sandler. His comic shtick has always depended on him living in his own head and being self-servingly slow-witted. The persona is a hostile onepassive-aggressive with the odd ferocious ejaculation. But Sandler was surprisingly soulful as an overgrown adolescent lashing out at the world for its unreliability in Paul Thomas Andersons tipsy romantic fantasia Punch-Drunk Love. And as Charlie Fineman hes like a dammed-up Bob Dylanhe even sports a shaggy Dylan-circa-1969 hair mop and a mumble that seems to issue straight from his sinuses. Hes always ready to boogieespecially when someone wants him to acknowledge the death of his family. The worst are his wifes parents (Robert Klein and Melinda Dillon) whove clung to the tragedy and rather selfishly feel they need his presence to help them cope. Cheadles Alan isnt that extreme but he does enlist the aid of a psychiatrist played by an oddly castbut not badLiv Tyler. 1 2 Next Share this story...

By David Denby Mark Wahlberg as a betrayed Marine marksman in Antoine Fuquas movie.   Credit FRANK STOCKTON An incomparable marksman stealthy silent relentless hiding among snowcapped peaks; the muzzle of a high-powered rifle aimed directly at the camera; helicopters swirling over mountains and city streets pursuing the hero from the sky; gunmetal colors everywhere and the chuggah-chuggah-chuggah of pounding drums and electronic music a sound both primal and advanced at the same time ""Shooter"" directed by Antoine Fuqua and starring Mark Wahlberg as Bob Lee Swagger a betrayed Marine marksman who becomes a vigilante crusader for justice is a virtual textbook of action cliches. Fuqua made something fiery and memorable out of ""Training Day"" (2001) with its demonic performance by Denzel Washington as a corrupt cop but here the director serves as little more than a skilled functionary. For two hours chase follows shoot-out as Swagger fires at men who like movie targets from time immemorial obligingly refuse to take cover. Swagger never misses--he could hunt mosquitoes for a living--and the extras both live and digital do their job; they fall down. The action has an oddly undifferentiated wearying feel to it. Yet this standard industrial product does something strange. On the surface the movie offers liberal ideological sentiments it condemns covert overseas operations controlled by oil interests; its angry at the higher-ups who escaped blame for Abu Ghraib; it exhibits a clear distaste for the person and values of Dick Cheney. But it places these sentiments within a matrix of gun culture and lonely-man-of-honor myths. Swagger is the latest incarnation of Rambo the anti-government crazy. The filmmakers may be trying to appeal both to liberals and to the Pat Buchanan conservatives who hate big government and multinational corporations and want American warriors to stay home. The clash of political currents suggests the degree of confusion roiling Hollywood at the moment. How do moviemakers find military heroes in the midst of an unpopular overseas war? When we first see Swagger he is taking down uniformed soldiers as part of a mysterious operation somewhere in the Horn of Africa. The operation is scrubbed and Swagger and his partner a spotter are abandoned. Outraged Swagger quits the Marines and moves to a cabin in Wyoming with his dog. But hes pulled back into action by a retired colonel (Danny Glover) who works in some unnamed federal agency. The colonel tells Swagger that a sniper may be planning to assassinate the President and the agency needs Swagger to think like him and track him down. But the hero is being set up--made to look (for reasons I will not explain) as though hes the one attempting the hit. The plotters try to eliminate their patsy on the spot. Swagger is shot twice falls through a window nearly drowns in the Delaware River yet with all of law enforcement after him manages to escape into the American nowhere. Throughout the rest of the movie he takes vengeance on the swine who tried to do him in--a rogue unit in the government operating under the control of a powerful oil-mad senator from Montana (the Cheney figure played by Ned Beatty). The government may be rotten but American honor is saved by the lone killer. The movie is based on the successful 1993 novel ""Point of Impact"" by the Washington Post film critic Stephen Hunter whose glumly macho fictions (there are three Bob Lee Swagger books) are very different in tone from his shrewd and funny reviews. Swagger has many notches on his gun. From a distance in hiding he has killed dozens of people in war and the movie celebrates his prowess in all its solitary cultic glory while wrapping him in an aura of sanctimonious approval. The mechanics of audience manipulation may be obvious here but they often work. The shooter twice betrayed becomes a victim. His fight against corrupt enemies absolves him of any personal guilt and we can simultaneously enjoy his skill at picking people off and the righteousness of his wrath. The screenwriter Jonathan Lemkin has acknowledged a debt not only to Hunter but to ""Three Days of the Condor"" and ""The Parallax View"" seventies thrillers that drew on fears of shadowy government conspiracies. Lemkin has updated the old plots with gun-catalogue lore. The movie is full of contented talk of rifles and ammunition and at one point Swagger picks up an astounding amount of what can only be called ordnance at a Virginia shopping mall. Snub-nosed and barrel-chested Wahlberg looks a little like a gun himself. ""What I love about Mark"" the movies producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura has said ""is hes not afraid to be a man."" Perhaps not but di Bonaventura and Fuqua seem afraid to let him be an actor. In this role he certainly has the stillness and the determination of a marksman but he mutters in a sludgy monotone thats hard to understand. Wahlberg has an unpretentious air about him and Id hate to see him get locked into dour star turns as an implacable killer. The engaging fast-talking idiosyncrasy of his performance in ""The Departed"" has vanished. In ""300"" a blood-dark account of the battle of Thermopylae the Spartan king Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and his noble queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) make love in the full splendor of their nakedness. When the Spartans pumped like linebackers leaving the weight room go out to fight they wear nothing but leather codpieces and red capes; they die clutching one anothers hands. The Persians go one better. Their king Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) an epicene seven-footer with a shaved head and what looks like a gold-lame thong lounges on cushions in his court surrounded by aroused lesbians intertwined and writhing like snakes in a basket. When he goes out to fight he commands an army of robed and turbaned slaves who enthusiastically hurl themselves onto Spartan spears. ""300"" which grossed nearly a hundred and thirty million dollars in its first ten days of release is perhaps the nuttiest film ever to become an enormous box-office hit. Based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller the movie is a porno-military curiosity--a muscle-magazine fantasy crossed with a video game and an Army recruiting film. The director Zack Snyder poses the Spartan heroes against the horizon or along the crests of mountains under roiling skies. The softening colors of blue and yellow have been filtered or drained out of the palette; the dominant remaining color is the molten brown-gold of bronze shields. The action is prolonged in agonizing slow motion only to snap to hyper-speed and then to a full stop leaving nothing moving but the fountain of blood spurting from a decapitated body. In Tehran after pirated copies hit the streets there a few weeks ago the movie was quickly denounced by an Iranian government spokesman as an act of ""psychological warfare"" that was intended to prepare Americans for an invasion of the country. ""American cultural officials thought they could get mental satisfaction by plundering Irans historic past and insulting this civilization"" he said. The complaint was echoed by President Ahmadinejad who said ""They are trying to tamper with history . . . by making Irans image look savage"" and a Time correspondent reported that many Iranians assumed that the movie was produced by an American government conspiracy. It is perhaps unfair to expect the Iranians to develop a sense of humor about American pop culture. They may also have trouble understanding that commercial American movies are ordered up not by ""cultural officials"" but by studio officials. The film is of course less an act of psychological warfare than an act of capitalism. It was called into being not by a hunger for war but by the desire to exploit a market--professional-wrestling and X-treme Fighting saturnalias play into the movies atmosphere. Everyone screams at everyone and specialized Persian warriors wearing masks and other freakish regalia turn up to do battle. Pop has always drawn energy from the lower floors of respectability; this movie in which fan-boy cultism reaches new levels of goofy chaos and sexual confusion draws energy from the subbasement. Still the Iranians have a point though first planned years ago ""300"" is a political fable that uneasily engages the current moment. An all-volunteer expeditionary force of Spartans ventures forth the warriors sacrificing themselves to stop the invading hordes from killing their wives and children which may be an allusion to the Bush Administrations get-them-in-Iraq-before-they-hit-us-here rationale. The Spartans also fight as a lofty narration informs us ""against mysticism and tyranny."" Against mysticism? How many ancient armies went to their deaths with that as their battle song? And how many men have died as the Spartans do to defend ""reason""? A whiff of contemporary disdain for the East--what the late Edward Said called ""Orientalism""--arises from the mayhem ""300"" turns into a dawn-of-democracy epic in which violence is marshalled to protect the future of Western civilization. Made in a time of frustration when Americans are fighting a war that they can neither win nor abandon ""300"" and ""Shooter"" feel like the products of a culture slowly and painfully going mad.

Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME ""I need you to plan a presidential assassination"" U.S. intelligence honcho Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover) tells ex-Marine Gunnery Sgt. and all-round super sniper Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg). Its for the good of the country of course Seems that the CIA has a tip on a plot to take a potshot at POTUS; and Swagger a former Marine Gunnery Sgt. who can nail a gnat from a mile away in a high wind is just the fellow to get into the mind of the would-be Hinckley and prevent the fourth killing of a U.S. President. If you smell a setup -- the old governmental double-cross -- dont bother congratulating yourself. Were only halfway through Act 1 of Shooter the latest movie in the conspiracy-theory genre. Filmmakers have spun some pretty decent political nightmares out of the fear of another Lincoln McKinley or Kennedy assassination. The Manchurian Candidate of blessed memory established the format; The Parallax View Three Days of the Condor Winter Kills JFK Conspiracy Theory and last years BBC fake-umentary Death of a President all ran cunning variations on it. Shooter written by Jonathan Lemkin from Stephen Hunters novel Point of Impact and directed by Antoine Fuqua is an honorable rather than exceptional addition to the canon. At the start Swagger still on active duty is perched on a hilltop in Ethiopia -- ""a country were not supposed to be in"" -- on assignment to shoot down some enemy soldiers. The movie has established its fidelity to the war and cop genres in this first scene when Swaggers spotter a nice kid mentions he cant wait to see his girlfriend back home and is promptly killed. That information also gives Swagger a rare ally (pretty stalwart Kate Mara who played Heath Ledgers daughter in Brokeback Mountain) once hes on the run from Washington D.C. to Tennessee which he calls ""the patron state of shootin stuff."" (The always authoritative Levon Helm has an excellent cameo here as a Yoda of gun lore.) His other helper is a rookie FBI agent (World Trade Centers Michael Pena) who does a lot of Internet research before he joins Swagger and gets to blow up some traitors. Fuqua who directed Training Day and King Arthur knows his male audience and knows that they like how-to movies on survival against all odds. So he spends plenty of screen time showing Swagger at work cauterizing his own bullet wound driving backward off a bridge into a river planting napalm (a nice Vietnam touch) in an enemy compound. Indeed the film is best at giving instructions in the assembling and detonation of weapons of movie distraction. And Wahlberg so muscled up he looks as if hes ready to explode is serious and committed to the genre. We happen to be in a period when the youngish male stars are mostly light comedians. Wahlberg could be the actor that action movies have been looking for since Sly Arnold Harrison Bruce Jackie and Jean-Claude -- all in their 50s or 60s -- got too old to execute the leg lifts necessary to kick bad guys in the butt. Like most of the earlier conspiracy thrillers this one proceeds from two warring premises a synoptic cynicism about the men who run things and a dewy belief in the myth of the lone hero. Youre to accept on faith that the high-level perps are both deeply malevolent and supremely competent. (Uh-huh. Then why cant they run a simple Iraq occupation?) In the Oliver Stone tradition -- who killed JFK? Everybody -- the mischief-makers have infected all branches of power the military the CIA the Senate big business. ""Theres no head to cut off"" one of the perps explains. ""This is a conglomerate."" With a monopoly on state-sponsored (stateside) terrorism they apparently can kill whomever gets in their way. Toward the end one of the villains (Rade Sherbedgia) spills the entire conspiracy plot to Swagger because ""This is just one dead man talking to another"" -- and because otherwise we wouldnt have a clue to whats going down. In opposition is just one person the Erin Brockovich of decommed soldiers a Rambo with a higher IQ -- Bob Lee Swagger With a surname redolent of American machismo and Christian names that suggest both Good Ol Boy and President Assassination Suspect Swagger is your standard-issue outlaw hero. He loves his pet pooch has little use for humans. On being offered the assignment to prevent an assassination he spits out his apolitical nihilism ""I dont much like this President. Didnt like the last one much either."" (As a non-voter for either Bush or Clinton hes in sync with nearly half of the American electorate.) But he soon has a personal motivation ""These boys killed my dog."" Besides a mans gotta do what a mans gotta do. And Swagger was born bred and trained to locate and kill the enemy. Even the enemy within. Toward the end Swagger gets a civics lesson from a venal Montana Senator (Ned Beatty) ""Theres always a confused soul who thinks that one man can make a difference.... Thats the problem with democracy."" Actually no. The problem with democracy is thinking that all men can make a difference. One man thats despotism or comic-book wish-fulfillment. Or the premise of nearly every Hollywood movie which says that the system is corrupt and the little guy can beat it. (Until the next movie where the system is corrupt...) With the entire U.S. police force half the military and seemingly most of the employees of Blackwater USA trying to kill him will Bob Lee survive? Wed never tell but a quick check of amazon.com will show that Hunter has already published two Swagger sequels. There are other conspiracies to uncover or invent other countries in need of a superhero. Readers and moviegoers need him too as an imaginary solution to monstrously real problems. Its too bad that Swagger is a fiction and that the notion of one man who can right wrongs is less plausible than the conspiracy fears that summoned him up as a solo world police force.

"Shooter Bang on | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesShooter Bang onDespite their national fervour for flag-waving our American neighbours remain something of a puzzle when it comes to actually believing in their system of government.In <i>Shooter</i> Mark Wahlberg plays former Marine crack sniper Bob Lee Swagger who gets called up to do one last job for the government.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. March 23 2007  (out of 4)Starring Mark Wahlberg Danny Glover Kate Mara and Michael Pena. Directed by Antoine Fuqua. 124 minutes. At major theatres. 14A  Article Continued Below Despite their national fervour for flag-waving our American neighbours remain something of a puzzle when it comes to actually believing in their system of government.They exalt truth justice and the pursuit of fossil fuels yet when you get right down it many of them are deeply suspicious about what actually goes on in the White House and Pentagon. The guy in the Oval Office isnt really running the show; its the shadow government in the dungeon below. Some lone nut with a grudge didnt shoot JFK; it had to be the work of a cabal of dark business and political interests funded by Havana or Moscow.Skepticism about the official story is without doubt justified. The victims of Watergate the Pentagon Papers and the non-existent Iraqi WMD have every reason to wonder if Pinocchio has been on the ballot. This systemic dread has fired the imagination of American filmmakers resulting in such masterpieces of mistrust as The Manchurian Candidate The Parallax View and Three Days of the Condor which also happen to be great entertainment. No other nation on Earth can top the U.S. for marrying paranoia with popcorn.Which leads us to Shooter a movie by the status quo-questioning Antoine Fuqua (Training Day) that may not qualify as a masterpiece yet is a masterful thriller nonetheless. Steeped in 1970s skulduggery yet right up to date with todays dubious War on Terror its a portrait of America that will slap the back of any grassy knoll theorist.It stars the all-American Mark Wahlberg as Bob Lee Swagger a former Marine scout sniper whom we meet in a prologue as he is delivering unsanctioned liberty to unsuspecting Ethiopians. Possessed of the almost supernatural ability to fire a rifle from more than a mile away - a distance that requires him to calculate not only velocity and wind resistance but also the rotation of the Earth - hes highly prized for his ability to get the job done quickly and covertly. Hes happy to do it too because after all hes an American.Something goes tragically wrong and when we next meet Swagger 36 months later hes living like the Unabomber in a remote mountain retreat (a cleverly disguised British Columbia). Hes grown a wispy beard donned lumberjack clothes and a ball cap and acquired a big hound dog for company. A copy of the final report of the 9/11 Commission is on his desk. He is to put it mildly supremely cheesed at his government for what happened in Ethiopia. Yet his government still wants and needs him.""Some people dont know what to do when their belief system collapses"" observes retired Col. Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover) a Medal of Honor winner who has been dispatched to Dogpatch to convince Swagger to do the proverbial one last job for Uncle Sam.Seems an assassination attempt on the president is nigh to be perpetrated by a sniper who is the equal of Swagger. Our reluctant hero is needed to scout locations on the presidents itinerary where a gunman could fire from a mile away and still get a clear shot. After much palaver and against his better judgment Swagger signs on for the gig and identifies a location that is both feasible and highly symbolic.Shots ring out and dark forces descend right on cue. Swagger is suddenly transformed from guardian angel into Public Enemy No. 1 as hated as Lee Harvey Oswald and John Wilkes Booth. He knows hes innocent but how does he find the real villain(s) and how does he avoid getting killed in the process?Students of cinema will recognize more than a little Rambo in the story penned by Jonathan Lemkin from the novel Point of Impact by Stephen Hunter. Which is to say that its not exactly the most believable of thrillers even for people who welcome UFO visitors and who are sure that 9/11 was dreamed up by that evil genius George W. Bush. But its one heck of a chase movie and the baby-faced Wahlberg makes for the most sympathetic fugitive since Bambi was fleeing Godzilla. Hes tough when he needs to be such as when hes driving a stolen FBI vehicle straight through a police roadblock. Yet hes also gentle enough to charm medical attention and other sweet ministrations out of a doe-eyed teacher (Kate Mara) who refuses to accept the official story that hes a bad bad man. Helping the cause is a disgruntled FBI man (Michael Pena) who has a sneaking suspicion that possibly just maybe Swagger was framed by counter-government spooks who keep their fingers crossed when they salute the flag. Shooter is right in step with that long and noble American film tradition of biting the hand that spoons the official Pablum. It even finds room during an unnecessary but highly entertaining side trip to an Arkansas gun nut (a spry Levon Helm) to casually speculate that the grassy knoll gunmen at the JFK assassination were spirited away in some kind of witness protection scheme.Pure codswallop of course. Stuff like that could never happen. But these Hollywood rascals never stop and Shooter has all the hallmarks of a profitable new franchise.Next thing you know some moviemaker will be having us slurp our Cokes while we watch the hilarious fiction about a war in the Middle East that was entirely invented by some backroom Washington hawk.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Shooter reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Shooter reviewed. Shooter reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.March 23 2007 514 PM Top Gun The political revenge fantasies of Shooter. By Dana Stevens To listen to Slates Spoiler Special about Shooter click the arrow button on the player below You can also click here to download the MP3 file or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed in iTunes by clicking here. Mark Wahlberg as ""Bob Lee Swagger"" in Shooter The hero of Shooter Antoine Fuquas libertarian action thriller is the marvelously named Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg). That three-part name inevitably suggests a political assassin but the ominous Oswaldian ""Lee"" is safely confined between two irreproachably virile handles the friendly-sounding ""Bob"" and the Eastwood-worthy ""Swagger."" Similarly Swaggers power to do harm--hes a former Marine sniper with world-class marksmanship skills and hes got a score to settle with the U.S. government--is kept in check by his innate sense of right and wrong. This characters complexity is contained in his very name. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Which is a good thing because theres certainly not much complexity to be found in Jonathan Lemkins script based on the novel Point of Impact by Stephen Hunter and directed by the man who made the notoriously unsubtle Training Day. Not that crudeness is necessarily a liability in this kind of movie Napalm explosions speak louder than words and a well-aimed rifle to the head can go a long way toward providing character motivation. Advertisement Though much of the action in Shooter is beautifully photographed the movies force is as a blunt instrument of metaphor. Shooter is a video-game-fantasy version of the 2006 midterm elections a howl of rage at the hypocrisy of the Bush presidency and the Iraq war (not that either is ever mentioned by name). The Dirty Harry-style villain in Shooter--the punk looking to make Bob Swaggers day--is none other than the U.S. government as embodied by an unctuous retired colonel (Danny Glover) and a Machiavellian senator from Montana (Ned Beatty). Beattys character--a ham-faced amateur hunter whos quite frank about his allegiance to big money-cant help but recall a certain Wyoming congressman turned vice president. Glovers Col. Johnson now an operative for an organization so shady that as one character explains ""it doesnt even have initials"" shows up one day at the Grizzly Adams-style cottage where Swagger has holed up after leaving the Marines. It seems that when a secret sniper mission in Africa went wrong Swaggers buddy was killed and he himself was deliberately left to die by the powers that be. As a result hes become the kind of crackpot who lives alone with his dog in Wyoming cruising a social-change site like Znet.com and reading The 9/11 Commission Report in a log cabin decorated with flags. Swagger is neither a progressive nor a conservative Hes a survivalist. Glover and his icky right-hand man (played with evil glee by Elias Koteas) pressure Swagger to use his expertise to help prevent a presidential assassination If he were going to make the near-impossible shot how would he do it? Swaggers righteousness--plus a satisfying practice shot at a Dinty Moore stew can placed at a distance of one mile--finally convinces him to scope out the suspected assassination site at Independence Hall in Philadelphia. But when the day of the presidents speech arrives all hell breaks loose The wrong guy dies and Swagger finds himself framed for the attempted assassination of the president and the actual assassination of--well youll see. The rest of the movie is a Rambo-style hide-and-seek chase as Swagger uses his special-ops training to treat his wounds with homemade IVs in gas-station bathrooms. Swagger seeks out Sarah Fenn (Kate Mara) the sexy-tough Southern widow of his former Marine buddy and the only person in the world that Swagger can trust with the truth (doesnt the guy have a mother?). Eventually the two find one other ally rookie FBI agent Nick Memphis (Michael Pena) who believes Swaggers been set up--and pays for that belief in a Guantanamo-like scene of extreme interrogation. Swagger kidnaps agent Memphis (but in a nice way) and teaches him how to manufacture napalm and stop trusting people. Together they pull off a Hardy Boys-style raid on the ranch of a legendary sharpshooter (Rade Sherbedgia spouting the same indeterminately accented spy-speak thats his specialty on 24). Helicopters crash disguises are donned and Levon Helm (the drummer from the Band) does a fun cameo as a wizened gun expert. Eventually everyone finds themselves atop a glacier in a standoff straight out of Sergio Leone (if The Man With No Name wore winter camouflage instead of a poncho). The movies final bloody coda hammers home its strangely powerful and absolutely nihilistic political message Everything sucks as much as it possibly can and even if youre named something as awesome as Bob Lee Swagger theres not much you can do about it. Swaggers one-man attempt to clean up the streets of Washington is presented as a futile almost symbolic gesture. The most he (and we) can expect is to satisfy our basest anti-establishment fantasy to track down the bastards who got us into this mess and blow them the fuck away (to be replaced presumably by other bastards). Theres no apparatus of justice in place at the end of this movie no public stockade in which to shame the perpetrators of all the war crimes cover-ups and lies. Theres just a lone dude with his girl in a getaway car leaving behind a pile of bodies. Swagger may be our hero but hes no savior. Challenged with the rhetorical question ""Do we allow America to be ruled by thugs?"" he can only shrug ""Sure some years we do."" Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Shooter"" with Mark Wahlberg Michael Pea Danny Glover Kate Mara Elias Koteas Rhona Mitra. Directed by Antoine Fuqua from a screenplay by Jonathan Lemkin based on the novel ""Point of Impact"" by Stephen Hunter. 126 minutes. Rated R for strong graphic violence and some language. Several theaters. Mark Wahlberg in ""Shooter"" is so tough you could serve him on a plate at a greasy-spoon diner with potatoes on the side. As Bob Lee Swagger (not exactly the name of a milquetoast) a former Marine scout sniper he single-handedly overcomes swarms of cops large dogs bullets submerged cars fire urban chaos reckless driving primitive surgery and some very scary hit men. Plus in a macho-movie master stroke hes taught his own dog to fetch beer from the fridge. Match that Rambo. Yes the testosterone meter is high in this competent if uninspired action thriller from Antoine Fuqua (""Training Day"" ""Tears of the Sun"") based on Stephen Hunters novel ""Point of Impact."" Swagger a combat hero and uncanny sharpshooter has walked away from military work in disillusionment sequestering himself in a remote mountain cabin with dog beer and plenty of weaponry. This idyll is interrupted by a carful of military men led by a retired colonel (Danny Glover) with a request Could Swagger swagger down from that mountain and help them ward off an imminent assassination attempt on the president? Reluctantly Swagger does so and its not one of his better decisions. A shot is indeed fired at the president and Swagger it turns out has been set up to take the fall. Quickly hes on the lam trying to unmask the conspiracy while every television screen in America displays his face as the presidential assassin. But hes not entirely alone enlisting the help of a long-ago friends widow (Kate Mara Heath Ledgers grown-up daughter in ""Brokeback Mountain"") and a rookie FBI agent (Michael Pena) who defies his colleagues sensing that perhaps Swagger wasnt the gunman after all. (For his pains a senior G-woman delivers to him the immortal line ""Youre asking questions way above your pay grade."") All of this unfolds briskly if somewhat predictably and plenty of standard-issue action-thriller scenes roll by the hero typing madly on a computer screen while tense music plays; the heroine placed in sudden danger a development telegraphed by Mara stripping down to a bra. And there are plenty of moments of Wahlberg grimacing in a lower-rent-Tom-Cruise-ish way so we remember that this guys been shot up with bullets and really should be lying down rather than running around uncovering conspiracies. Action-wise it all works as intended but ""Shooter"" lacks the character drama of Fuquas ""Training Day"" (which won Denzel Washington his first Oscar). Part of the problem is Jonathan Lemkins screenplay which tells us things about Swagger rather than showing us. ""Hes a man with a history of duty and patriotism"" says Glover making sure we get it. Wahlberg a recent Academy Award nominee for ""The Departed"" never makes his character distinctive but rather relies on his usual flinty toughness. The role of action hero suits him with his bland good looks and impressive biceps but there isnt a real performance here. Perhaps thats just as well; itd be lost among the gunfire anyway.

Dressed like a shrub and planted as much as a mile away the pictures lonesome hero Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) adjusts his aim to allow for the smallest gust of wind and for the rotation of the Earth while the bullet is in flight.

At the end of this elaborate sequence of calculations awaits a villain - a man in all his particulars but prone to impure thoughts - and a dull but satisfying thud as those thoughts fly out of his head atomized into a fine mist. One minute he is and the next he emphatically isnt. There is no dying. When a slug scoops out your brain like a melon-baller you are just ended. Despite its obvious aspirations to be the kind of paranoid political thriller that ""The Parallax View"" and ""Three Days of the Condor"" were in the mid-70s ""Shooter"" is at its best - which is very good indeed - when its a rootin tootin shootin party. To set its conspiratorial plot in motion however ""Shooter"" requires a fair amount of throat clearing which commences when a flock of government boys arrive at Swaggers mountaintop retreat. They have come to ask the former Marine sniper to help prevent a presidential assassination and according to Col. Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover) of the Federal Agency That Never Bothers to Show Any ID the fateful shot will be taken from a mile away.Advertisement Only a handful of men in the whole world can make that shot which is enough to arouse Swaggers curiosity and overcome his abandonment issues. During a mission three years earlier he was left to die in the African desert and you can tell by his peekaboo ponytail that hes still bitter about it. But the thing about ol Bob Lee Swagger is when his country calls he comes. The other thing about him is when things go sideways on assassination day and he is framed as the shooter he ought to be the easiest kind of fugitive to hunt because he immediately reverts to his military training. Yet somehow with the combined forces of the FBI the Philadelphia police and Danny Glovers Agency Whose Only Headquarters Seems To Be In An SUV arrayed against him Swagger escapes. He does this by overpowering rookie FBI agent Nick Memphis played by Michael Pena whose last law enforcement gig was playing a cop at the bottom of the rubble pile in ""World Trade Center."" (The characters in this movie either have no names exceptionally colorful ones - Memphis Swagger Payne - or in the case of Archbishop Desmond Mutumbo appear to be named after South African clerics who once led the NBA in shot-blocking.) When Memphis becomes the inter-agency scapegoat for allowing Bob Lee to swagger away he begins asking questions. This is a rookie mistake and after many more years at the FBI he will know better. But for the time being of course he must be subjected to an FBI review board. Or brutally murdered. Whichever comes first. After Memphis too goes on the run he is aided by a woman at the Bureau who is either a fellow agent or the night cleaning woman; this is a little unclear. (In the credits we learn the characters name is Alourdes Galindo which is funny because we thought she looked like an Alourdes Galindo.) She feeds Memphis information that leads him to Swagger after which the two of them turn the tables on the conspirators and begin hunting them. This is when the movie gets interesting. For all Swaggers survival skills when it comes to the big stuff he needs to get a clue. It never occurs to him for instance that plotting a presidential assassination might look bad on his re`sume`. And after the fateful shot is fired when the movies focus turns to the manhunt and Swaggers ability to evade it there are no news reports about the condition of the president of the United States. Is he dead? Wounded? Has he been taken to Alourdes for a cure? We dont know. And furthermore we dont care. Bob Lee Swagger has got hisself a girlfriend There is nothing quite like being the most wanted man in America to make you a chick magnet and this apparently is especially true in Kentucky. Thats where Swagger goes to find the one person he thinks will hide him (she does) perform surgery on him without anesthesia (she does) and speak like an authentic Kentucky hillbilly gal (OK two out of three). Toting his long-barreled snipers rifle like Sergeant York Swagger tells Sarah (Kate Mara) that he was framed though that turns out to be unnecessary. He had her at ""Hello would you slice me open like a Christmas goose while I huff aerosol propellants from what appear to be cans of whipped cream?"" Most of the conspiracy scenario in ""Shooter"" is so ridiculous that if you think about it for even a moment the movie will just collapse. So dont do that. Director Antoine Fuqua working from a swiftly paced script by Jonathan Lemkin keeps the heads exploding and the action moving so that no thought is required. And in Swagger the movie has a hero of such good intentions and ruthless efficiency that Wahlberg is able to add another notable performance to his Oscar-nominated turn in ""The Departed."" ""Shooter"" wont win any Oscars but it has blood and brains and even some heart. Theyre splattered all over the screen.

Starring Mark Wahlberg Michael Pena Danny Glover and Kate Mara. Directed by Antoine Fuqua. (R. 124 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to SF Gate.com/movies.) Remember that really cool scene in ""First Blood"" when Rambo pulls a needle and thread out of his knife and stitches up a laceration on his own arm? He looks like a whiny little baby compared with Mark Wahlbergs character in ""Shooter"" who self-treats a variety of gaping wounds while running from the law -- at one point hooking himself up to a makeshift plasma IV made out of a plastic bag a pound of sugar and a bicycle pump. Director Antoine Fuqua keeps the testosterone flowing in this framed-man-on-the-run thriller and the always reliable Wahlberg comes one step closer to making everyone forget about the Marky Mark years. (Were not quite there yet.) But the crushing two-hour-plus running time and Tom Clancy-for-dummies plot sabotage the film which becomes particularly ridiculous in the last 30 minutes. By the time Ned Beatty shows up late in the movie as the baddest of the bad guys the makers of ""Shooter"" almost seem to be intentionally going for humor. Its too bad because Fuqua has a talent for filling his plots with nuance while maintaining a brisk action-movie pace. His best film ""Training Day"" was gritty felt real and had plenty of surprises but still worked as a shoot-em-up. And you walked away thinking you learned something about corrupt cops and gang life even though it was probably all made up. ""Shooter"" tries to do the same thing with military snipers and government conspiracies. The good guy is Bob Lee Swagger (yet another Wahlberg character with a great porn name) one of the four or five best marksmen on the planet. The first scenes are the best where Swagger and others explain the difficulty of making a head shot at more than a mile away. Trigonometry is involved and the Earths rotation figures into the equation. How awesome is that? The movie looks like a sure winner after the opening action sequence where a hit in Africa goes bad and Swagger ends up single-handedly taking on a small army. But after a couple of double crosses Fuqua starts to show more of his hand which looks a little too much like Michael Moores. As the conspiracies pile up Swagger ends up on the run from an oil profits-obsessed government that is corrupt in every corner. His only allies are a low-level FBI agent (Michael Pena) and his dead partners girlfriend (Kate Mara) who dropped out of nursing school because she couldnt stand the sight of blood. Guess who gets to remove all the dead flesh from inside Swaggers bullet wounds? Fuquas heavy political slant might be an interesting twist on the genre if it was played with more than a hint of realism. But for every nice touch in the script -- Swagger gets weapons information from an Internet chat room filled with gun nuts -- there are five lines of over-the-top dialogue delivered by characters who seem to be evil just for the sake of being evil. (""Theres always a confused soul who thinks one man can make a difference"" one character says. ""And you have to kill him to convince him otherwise."") Wahlberg does his best to get past his clunker lines and plays the kind of tough guy that we used to get before scrawny wimps such as Orlando Bloom and Ryan Phillippe started getting People magazine covers. Hes sort of like Harrison Ford in ""The Fugitive"" except he knows a lot more about ballistics and doesnt run like a duck. Unfortunately the movie really needs an antagonist with the presence of Tommy Lee Jones or at least Alan Rickman. Instead we have Beatty an otherwise fine thespian who is only slightly more menacing than Fred Rogers and Gary Burghoff. His character also has really bad teeth which adds to the films assault on reality. Since C-SPAN came on the air no U.S. senator has gone out in public without a nice set of veneers. -- Advisory This film contains adult language torture and violent gunplay -- although all the exploding heads put together arent half as disturbing as Wahlbergs ridiculous Nancy McKeon-from-""The Facts of Life"" ponytail that the actor wears for 10 minutes in the middle of the film.

BY Jack Mathewsdaily News Movie Critic Friday March 23 2007 400 AM View the gallery ""Shooter"" Action thriller about an ex-Marine sniper framed as an assassin by his own government. With Mark Wahlberg Danny Glover Michael Pena. Director Antoine Fuqua (204). R Language sexual references. At area theaters. Antoine Fuquas ""Shooter"" is sort of the Muscle Beach of contemporary political thrillers. The author of the novel from which it was adapted the screenwriter who wrote it and Fuqua (""Training Day"") himself are tough guys with sassy attitudes and six-pack abs on their resumes. Their movie doesnt play; it flexes snorts sweats and grunts. And it certainly doesnt use its head; the plot is so dense and cockamamie trying to follow it isnt worth the bother. Supposedly years in the writing ""Shooter"" - adapted from Washington Post film critic Stephen Hunters ""Point of Impact"" - creates a superhero version of Rambo. His name is Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) a disillusioned ex-Marine sniper whos drawn out of retirement to help the Secret Service prevent a planned assassination of the President. The premise is that in three speaking appearances the Prez is vulnerable only to a bullet fired from more than a mile away something only Swagger and one or two other marksmen could pull off. So Swagger scouts the three sites identifies the likely sniper nest and waits for the feds to do their job. But its all a setup. The target isnt the President but an African leader sharing the podium with him in a Philadelphia park. Swagger who escapes the trap with two bullet wounds is immediately pegged as the killer and becomes the target of a national manhunt. As hes being pursued he has just two allies Sarah (Kate Mara) the gutsy girlfriend of his late Marine partner; and Nick Memphis (Michael Pena) a young FBI agent who smells a rat and conducts his own investigation. If this were a more serious film its cynicism about the U.S. government would put it in a league with ""The Manchurian Candidate."" But it is simply an Arnold Schwarzenegger action flick with bantamweight Wahlberg doing the heavy lifting for the preoccupied Governator. We hope Wahlberg is enjoying himself because Hunter has written another Bob Lee Swagger novel and the crowd-pleasing ""Shooter"" should produce a sequel.

Photo Paramount Pictures Wahlbergs Shooter a classic tale of vengeance 1 / 2 Back to Gallery For a few precious minutes near the start of Shooter a Rambolicious tribute to all that is vengeful and true Mark Wahlberg appears on-screen in the worlds ugliest ponytail and the worlds scuzziest cap. This is not a good look for him It blurs the shoe-box masculinity of his face. But it gives the film a flicker of grungy realism an effect quickly lost in a sleek scattershot and vigorously incoherent vigilante flick that assumes the high ground just long enough to slay every corrupt dirt-ball in its path. Its mounting body count is as snappily directed and morally smug as the genre requires unleashing a firestorm of bullets with a cross-wired patriotism that wants it both ways. On the one hand the Constitution is a good thing. Yay checks and balances Yay rule of law On the other hand anyone who opposes the Constitution deserves to be fried. Yay lawless killer The lone wolf here is named Bobby Lee Swagger (Wahlberg) and that alone should tell you something. It tells you he is a Man. It tells you he has a Dog. It tells you he is a government-trained ace sniper who lost his best bud on a mission in Africa a tragic episode that opens the film. After that Swagger turns hermit and holes up in Gods country with his guns and his survivalist hairdo nursing a major grudge against the feds. When a smooth-talking colonel (Danny Glover who should know better) and his flunkies (including almost inevitably Elias Koteas) show up outside his cabin Swagger is suspicious. When the colonel asks him to help thwart a presidential assassination by assuming the assassins POV -- scoping out sites angles wind direction the whole bit -- Swagger is still suspicious but not suspicious enough to stop the plot in its tracks by saying no. So he agrees. He cuts his hair and scouts locales. And guess what? Hes framed. At the very moment the assassin pops one off during a presidential speech killing an Ethiopian archbishop Swagger is fingered as the gunman and shot by a local cop. But Swagger gets away bleeding staggering proclaiming his innocence to a small-fry FBI agent named Nick Memphis (the impressive Michael Pena out from under the rubble in World Trade Center). For a while Shooter whooshes along in a thrilling run of hunted-man scenes Hunted man clobbers pursuers hunted man buys supplies hunted man hides out with Sarah the dead friends lovely widow (Kate Mara We Are Marshall). In one amusing sequence Swagger bombs himself on a can of whipped cream so Sarah can operate on his shoulder. There are others highlights too most of them involving byplay with the nervy intrepid Nick -- and an old-coot shooting guru played by Band mate Levon Helm whose conspiracy theorizing sounds almost reasonable compared to the rest of the films hooey. Director Antoine Fuqua who politicized and sensitized King Arthur has an obvious blast with the action set pieces -- all those cool guns all that sneaking around in camo -- but loses his grip when the plot goes preachy on a slime-merchant congressman played by Ned Beatty. Jonathan Lemkins screenplay (from the Stephen Hunter novel Point of Impact) thereafter drives off a cliff of Death Wish banalities that abuse credibility story integrity and a supporting character who shall not be named. ""Justice does not always prevail"" intones the attorney general and Bobby Lee takes the lesson to heart.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Writers are an envious lot truth be told. Theres an old joke every fall ""The bad news is I didnt win the Nobel Prize for literature. The good news is none of my friends won either."" Imagine the stabs Washington Post movie critic Stephen Hunter will take as ""Shooter"" opens this week. Not only is Hunter a Pulitzer Prize winner for his newspaper work hes also a best-selling novelist for books like ""Point of Impact"" on which ""Shooter"" is based. So when I nick the entertaining but cliched ""Shooter"" for alleged flaws youll have to take my word that Im firing for effect rather than from pure jealousy. Hunter didnt write the screenplay for ""Shooter"" and the movies high points come straight from his highly readable Bob Lee Swagger novels. The low points come straight out of Hollywood. Mark Wahlberg is Bob Lee transplanted for movie purposes from his snipers role in Vietnam to the Ethiopian/Eritrean border in Africa. He hides with a trusted partner picking off the leaders of a presumably evil band of rebels on behalf of a super- secret U.S. mission. Mission goes bad partner gets killed guilt-ridden Swagger retreats to the Montana hills and swears off government work for good. Three years later the scuzzy chief of a super-super-secret U.S. agency (Danny Glover) climbs the hill and asks for Bob Lees help. Seems another top sniper is about to assassinate the president. They need Bob Lees advice to scope the angles and catch the killer just before he strikes. Bob Lee reluctantly accepts of course or there would be no movie. Its not giving away too much plot to reveal that theres a double-cross. Bob Lee hightails it out of town accused of murder. What gives Hunters novels a heft beyond pure beach-blanket pulp is a pervasive sense of grim depressive paranoia. Power corrupts absolutely the thinking goes and the best defense for the average man is a withdrawal from society and a determined reading of his ballistics tables. Hunter like the heroes he creates is an intellectual gun-nut poring over obscure shooting manuals and calculating the effect of ambient humidity on 1000-yard rifle shots. ""Shooter"" tosses around the right words in service of this snipers ideal and some of the right pictures. The always-appealing Wahlberg mutters knowingly about wind-speed bore deflection and the detectable impact of earth rotation on long-range targeting. We kid you not the snipers world of worries is well the whole world. The best parts of ""Shooter"" are a couple of set action pieces one at a Virginia farm safehouse and the other atop a Montana glacier. With more spatter-shots than the conclusion of ""The Departed"" Bob Lee dispatches evil with frightening skill and admirable stoicism. Michael Pena lends some subtle humor and warmth as the slovenly well-intentioned FBI agent Nick Memphis. (No one not potboiler novelists nor Hollywood screenwriters demands a reality check on character names.) Unlike Hunters novels though Jonathan Lemkins screenplay doesnt stand up to scrutiny for plausibility or continuity. Glover and his henchmen have more swagger - sorry - than menace. ""Yer a hard man to find."" Aint a good man always so? Apparently the latest visceral signal that your secret agent is a bad guy is that he wears one of those goofy Bluetooth earpieces for his cellphone. The cornpone widow of aforementioned dead buddy (Kate Mara pretty but empty) is all too ready for amateur surgery and miniskirted sleuthing. When Bob Lee is running across an open field shot at by a helicopter gunship and 30 heavily armed marksmen he uses that time-honored impregnable technique to escape the zig-zag. Hunter certainly wont review ""Shooter"" himself but I suspect hed be honest enough to give the movie what it deserves a middling endorsement. ""Shooter"" boasts a likable hero and the possibility of a sequel and Hollywood rarely asks for a more storybook ending than that.

"Mark Wahlberg is on his mark as sniper with attitude in Antoine Fuquas Shooter - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW The marksman Mark Wahlberg is on target as a sniper with attitude in grim Shooter Mark Wahlberg (right) is special forces sniper Bob Lee Swagger and Michael Pena is an FBI agent in ""Shooter."" (kimberley french) By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  March 23 2007 How to describe ""Shooter""? Mark Wahlbergs bid to become the next Clint Eastwood ? An action-film Humvee with a ""support our troops"" ribbon magnet slapped on the back?How about ""Rambo"" as Al Franken might have imagined it?Thats about right The new film from ""Training Day"" director Antoine Fuqua -- hes what youd get if you put an auteurist on steroids -- is a stylish but essentially businesslike smash-and-crasher about a special forces sniper who gets used by a shadow arm of the US government only to come back for bloody revenge.The movie stops short of accusing the villains of masterminding 9/11 but maybe just because they lacked the manpower. For assassinations Third World genocide oil-pipeline skullduggery theyre your go-to guys. And up against them is only Bob Lee Swagger (Wahlberg).Did novelist Stephen Hunter come up with that name using some kind of NASCAR randomizing algorithm? The author (and Pulitzer-winning film critic for The Washington Post) wrote ""Point of Impact"" back in 1993 when Bob Lee was an aging Vietnam vet; the novels success led to two more books featuring the character and eventually this long-in-development film.Its too late for Bob Lee to have served in Nam of course so the filmmakers elect to plop him in northeast Africa in the early part of the new millennium where a mission protecting US troops goes awry. ""Bob the Nailer"" -- thats how hes referred to in hushed tones throughout the armed forces -- returns to the States holes up in a back country shack with his hound dog grows a mullet and broods. The movie calls the country he served in Ethiopia but emotionally its Iraq and youd be a fool to think otherwise.A government suit named Johnson (Danny Glover ) arrives three years later and plays on Bob Lees dormant patriotism The president of the United States has been threatened with assassination and they need a shooter to catch a shooter. Or so they say. What the movie needs actually is a fugitive with jungle-hillbilly survival skills Harrison Ford crossbred with Lil Abner.Wahlberg brings a grim purposefulness to his role and he doesnt grandstand or preen. Personally I prefer the actor when he has his thinking cap on as in ""The Departed "" or when hes at a dimbulb loss (""I Heart Huckabees "" ""Boogie Nights "") but hes eminently watchable here. Bob Lees a man with a serious talent and while the movie fetishizes the hardware and the long-distance exploding-head shots the character doesnt have the time to do likewise. Theres a lot of pink mist in ""Shooter"" though which will excite certain boys of many ages. All I can say is better here than in the Zapruder film.Bob Lees an awfully glum fellow to hang a movie on so ""Shooter"" gives him Nick Memphis (Michael Pena  the locksmith in ""Crash"") an FBI newbie who figures out all is not what it seems. There needs to be a girl too so the hero briefly takes refuge with a late colleagues fiancee (Kate Mara  red-haired wide-eyed handy with a shotgun). For sadistic villains we get character actors Elias Koteas and Rade Serbedzija  respectively drooling and sighing fatalistically.Look fast and youll even spot dear old Ned Beatty as a porcine senator. Wahlbergs Bob Lee seems he knows how to handle all these folks except the girl.The film moves at a clip and smartly alternates mayhem and drama. Its as professional as Bob Lee himself and I was never bored even watching a storyline Ive seen in countless variations. All thats new or new for the first time in a few decades is that unfocused anger against the people in charge. ""Shooter"" carries a heady whiff of post-Iraq populist brimstone -- a resentment over the fact that no matter what the government says theyre not acting in the interests of you me America or the world.Bob Lee in other words is Billy Jack. And hes headed for Washington. (c) Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company.

A 70s-style political conspiracy thriller outfitted with contempo action techno gear ""Shooter"" is a brawny loner-against-a-duplicitous-government suspenser that asserts its own personality despite adherence to genre specifications. An immediately involving yarn of an ace Marine sharpshooter set up to take the fall for an attempted presidential assassination pic saddles itself with stereotypical villains hokey contrivances and too-expedient crisis solutions. But its skeptical disillusioned take on big government and official deceptions should strike a vibrant chord with a wide range of audiences as will the ample serving of dramatic just desserts resulting in potent B.O. in all markets. Among other things ""Shooter"" provides one answer to the oft-asked question of who can replace the aging action stars of the 80s and 90s. Following up his tangy turn in ""The Departed"" Mark Wahlberg easily fills shoes that once would have been worn by Sylvester Stallone or Bruce Willis. Hes got the focused determination the street smarts and the bod; hes aged enough now to have cast off the juvenile callowness and as an actor he clearly understands the Gary Cooper principle that less is usually more for a stoical hero in such fare. Adapting Washington Post film critic Stephen Hunters novel ""Point of Impact"" the first entry in a trilogy featuring military sniper Bob Lee Swagger scenarist Jonathan Lemkin stirs in recognizable ingredients from ""The Parallax View"" ""The Day of the Jackal"" ""Seven Days in May"" and ""Three Days of the Condor"" feeding on and encouraging suspicion of nefarious deeds and dastardly motives among men in high places. In a nine-minute Horn of Africa prologue Swagger (Wahlberg) is seen doing what he does best picking off enemies from a great distance in a clandestine operation. When his partner is killed and opposition forces gather however the Marines clear out and abandon the marksman to fend for himself. Its just the first of many occasions when hell be asked to do so and never does the slightest doubt arise that hell be up to the task. Three years later Swagger is ensconced in a Wyoming mountain cabin with his dog and firearms; when he goes online to survey the days news and mutters ""Lets see what lies theyre trying to sell us today"" its unclear whether hes turned into Jeremiah Johnson or the Unabomber. But when a vaguely defined Washington insider retired Col. Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover) comes to call he soon finds Swaggers Achilles heel patriotism. Intelligence suggests the president is about to be the target of a long-distance assassination attempt and Johnson insists only Swagger can deduce the would-be killers plans. Cementing his appeal for audiences on the left and then the right Swagger replies ""I dont like the president much. I didnt like the one before"" then reluctantly agrees to help reconnoitering public places in D.C. Baltimore and Philly before deducing Independence Hall will be the location for the attack. When the shooting goes awry and another official is killed all fingers have been prearranged to point at Swagger who slips through one tight spot after another with every cop in the country on his tail. Instructing the audience in diverse injury survival skills along the way he eventually finds sanctuary at the old Kentucky home of his late buddys former g.f. Sarah (Kate Mara). Sarahs a lonely hottie and her rather too extreme allure suddenly yanks focus to other matters. It also reps just the first of numerous improbabilities among them Swaggers ever-ready vigilance in the face of attack and the stock villainy of clandestine government nasties. Even after more than 40 years a director should never put an evil foreign-accented government schemer (played here by Rade Sherbedgia) into a wheelchair and expect not to summon unwanted comparisons to ""Dr. Strangelove."" Likewise Elias Koteas slimy goon all but drools when he gets his hands on Sarah and Ned Beattys right-wing senator has in every way been made to resemble a certain vice president with questionable riflery skills. All the same Lemkin and helmer Antoine Fuqua have constructed such a taut tale around a man so unfairly scorned by his superiors that one can scarcely help but develop a deep rooting interest. Most crucial factor in the films success is the conception of the Swagger character; he represents the classic American individualist of the sort one sees less and less of both onscreen and in real life a dont-tread-on-me patriot a cowboy loner whos only dangerous when crossed. Anyone with a healthy libertarian streak will embrace the entirely non-partisan way Swagger takes on an overgrown political apparatus. During a ""One-Eyed Jacks""-like second act in which Swagger bides his time while recovering from injuries centerstage is shared by young FBI agent Nick Memphis (Michael Pena). Memphis dares to question the party line on what went down in Independence Square an attitude quietly encouraged by a sultry bureau cohort (Rhona Mitra). Arriving in the middle of all this is a show-stopping one-scene cameo by Levon Helm as an aged Southern firearms expert who guides the hero through esoteric realms of ammunition history. By the time its over Swagger has taken down countless well-armed men in Ramboesque one-man-army style on his way to dealing with the big shots they protect. In any future Swagger installments though the bad guys will know better than to mess with his dog. Fuqua and his team serve the action straight up with no frills and a potent punch. British Columbian locations including spectacular mountaintops in the Whistler area stand in for settings as diverse as Montana and East Africa although actual Philly and D.C. locations are used where they count. All behind-the-scenes contributions are strong. Shooter ProductionA Paramount release of a Di Bonaventura Pictures production. Produced by Lorenzo Di Bonaventura Ric Kidney.

Disheveled and intense the scooterist resembles a younger Bob Dylan. His name is Charlie Fineman he is played by Adam Sandler and hes anything but simple. Like many of Mr. Sandlers characters Charlie boils with inchoate rage beneath a simpletons placid exterior. The difference here is the source of his distress -- his wife and children were on one of the planes that hit the World Trade Center on 9/11 and losing them has turned Charlie once a successful dentist into a sort of Rain Man shut off from the world. This is not a simple picture. Its serious disarmingly funny at times and certainly ambitious yet diminished by some of the traits that have made the standard Sandler characters so popular. ENLARGE The film which takes its title from the song by The Who was written and directed by Mike Binder the man responsible for ""The Upside of Anger"" the fine 2005 comedy about female rage. His new one a raunchy hymn to the power of friendship co-stars Don Cheadle as Alan Johnson a prosperous cosmetic dentist who roomed with Charlie in college. (Refreshingly race doesnt enter into the picture; the script is color-blind.) Fourteen years after dental school and half a decade after 9/11 Alan chances to see Charlie scooting by catches up with him and discovers why his old friend dropped out of sight. Moved by his plight Alan becomes the instrument of Charlies renewal -- his possible renewal since Alan is only an amateur therapist treating a patient who could pass for a paranoid schizophrenic. In a New York story thats Hollywood-heavy with healers and healing (Liv Tyler plays an earnest shrink) one hand must therapize the other so Charlie also serves as the instrument of his friends liberation -- from Alans own emotional opacity and from the tedium of what he calls ""putting phony teeth on phony people."" As the movie wears on though Charlies behavior grows not only repetitive -- mood swings between violent and sweetly passive rageful and contrite -- but increasingly reminiscent of the Sandler archetype a sly Peter Pan who persists in being lovable. Indeed Charlie goes beyond childhood into a cloying infantilism thats only partly explained by regression in the face of unmanageable tragedy; you wonder how he ever worked with a probe and drill. Don Cheadle is as always a quietly commanding star with an engaging quick-witted presence. Still his character like much of the movie suffers from a case of what seems to be communicable infantilization. Alan is an educated man with a lovely wife -- played attractively by Jada Pinkett Smith -- and bright children. Yet he like others around him cant seem to grasp let alone articulate the gravity of Charlies condition. Thus the drama keeps lapsing into conventional comedy (which sometimes works well) when it isnt converting Charlies grief and Alans frustration into the borderline bathos of buddies who are both wounded birds. Saffron Burrows is eerily amusing as Donna Remar a troubled beauty with nymphomaniacal tendencies but Donna too falls into the prevailing pattern of being healed and more alarming still helping to heal. Only Paula Newsome as Melanie a receptionist in Alans office gets to play -- gleefully well -- a cynic whose delicious cynicism stays unsoftened. Melanies a real person with real teeth and a real bite. Shooter Mark Wahlberg stars as the peerless marksman of ""Shooter"" an updating and downgrading of Stephen Hunters popular 1993 novel ""Point of Impact."" Betrayed by his beloved Marines after a covert mission in the Horn of Africa goes bad Bob Lee Swagger leaves the military for the life of a mountain man until hes seduced into quasi-governmental service. Soon hes betrayed yet again by a shadowy cabal that awakens his dormant patriotism then frames him as a presidential assassin. The result is lots of gunplay and explosions governed by little logic plus some tantalizing factoids about things that a sniper must consider before sniping at a target a mile away. (Including the Coriolis effect which involves the rotation of the earth.) If theres an organizing principle at work in the film which was directed by Antoine Fuqua its that everyone in government is corrupt. The bad guys include a Strangelovian character in a wheelchair so ""Shooter""s covert intent could have been satire. Overtly though its definitely about shooting betrayal and shooting. In that order. Pride ENLARGE Terrence Howard and Bernie Mac in Pride the story of an inner-city swimming team. Terrence Howard is a singular star -- firmly grounded never flashy yet formidably intense and capable of communicating passion with a poignant glance. And ""Pride"" is a tale that needed to be told. Its the story of Jim Ellis an inspirational coach who founded an inner-city swim team in Philadelphia in the early 1970s and who continues to this day bringing young African-Americans to competitive swimming. Despite Mr. Howards best efforts in the role though the film rarely realizes its subjects potential. The first signs of trouble appear in the opening credits -- four writers and preposterously 17 producers. Its impossible to know which of these cooks did what to the scripts thin broth. But the telling of a relatively straightforward story is semicoherent and the hero is written so sketchily that he barely has a life outside the run-down recreation center where he works and which he rehabilitates for the benefit of the neighborhood kids. What a waste -- and not only of a shot at genuine uplift or of Bernie Mac a gifted comic actor who seems baffled by his perfunctory role as the rec centers janitor. ""Pride"" chooses to airbrush the authentic black anger of the period in the course of dramatizing the clash between Jim Elliss team and the bigoted whites they swam against. Yet all isnt lost. Terrence Howards participation confers authority on the production and Elliss young swimmers have their own unquenchable exuberance. ""Keep your focus"" the coach tells them. They do and so does he even though the film cant. Offside By any conventional measure ""Offside"" a film from Iran by Jafar Panahi falls somewhere between small and slight. Yet this charming comedy takes on a big subject with great zest. It concerns the plight of Iranian women -- wait wait this is no earnest feminist tract -- who happen to be soccer fans but who are excluded from the nations stadiums even though they may be equal to Iranian men in their passion for the sport. The heroines are a diverse group of young Tehrani women whove been busted for trying to crash a World Cup qualifying match against Bahrain. Most of the action takes place in a stadium holding pen where boobish boys in military uniforms seek to explain the logic of the policy they enforce. They dont know what theyre talking about of course. But the delicately subversive Mr. Panahi makes his subjects perfectly clear -- the stupidity of authority and the hypocrisy of discrimination. ""Offside"" is surprisingly entertaining and edifying to boot.    DVD TIP Adam Sandlers dark side was put to brilliant use in ""Punch-Drunk Love"" (2002) Paul Thomas Andersons one-of-a-kind comedy of anxiety and explosive delusion. Mr. Sandler is Barry Egan the addled lover of the title and Emily Watson is Lena the woman of Barrys dreams. Jon Brion did the percussive and inimitable soundtrack.
