In the former the conclusion--when the sleuth explains whodunit and how--was everything; what led up to it was mere ""passagework"" a careful alignment of plot elements to enable that final big revelation. In the hard-boiled genre by contrast the opposite was true ""[T]he scene outranked the plot in the sense that a good plot was one that made good scenes."" Its one of many insights that Kiss Kiss Bang Bang writer/director Shane Blacks sly ironic contribution to the genre gets exactly right. As with Chandlers tales the plot of the film is almost willfully convoluted. But its also largely beside the point an excuse for quite a few good scenes most of them equal parts homage and subversion. The familiar ingredients of the hard-boiled school (and the noir cinema it spawned) are all here the half-glittering half-seedy L.A. setting; the protagonists expository voiceover; the jaded but ultimately decent private eye; the dead body that mysteriously turns up exactly where its not wanted. But Black gives each element a satiric twist the tough shamus is gay; the corpse is discovered in a bathroom and accidentally peed on; the first-person narrator is not so much unreliable as simply incompetent. That narrator is Harry Lockhart (Robert Downey Jr.) the movies hero and he is incompetent at many things. We first meet him in that most disjunctive of settings the L.A. Christmas party. Standing by a massive swimming pool in which a Santa hat is sinking lazily he informs the audience ""You may wonder how I wound up here. Or maybe not. Maybe you wonder how Silly Putty picks shit up from comic books. Point is I dont see another goddamn narrator here so pipe down."" From there he loops backward and forward stutter-stepping his way through the story stopping to revise as necessary. (""Oh shit I skipped something"" he chides himself at one point. ""This is bad narrating."") Just a few days earlier Harry was an inept petty thief in New York City. But fleeing police after a burglary gone awry he stumbled into an open movie audition where his authentic distress was mistaken for method acting. In no time Harry is in Hollywood as the presumptive star of a cop flick. (Hence the party.) To research his role hes assigned ""detective lessons"" with big-time P.I. Perry van Shrike aka ""Gay Perry"" (Val Kilmer). But their routine stakeout becomes decidedly non-routine when they witness a car dumped into a lake with a dead woman locked in the trunk. Harry meanwhile has met his dream girl struggling actress Harmony Faith Lane (Michelle Monaghan); when her sister goes missing he pretends to be a private eye and offers to help. Soon the two cases--the girl from the lake and Harmonys sister--are revealed to be connected. Of course we knew they would be because Harry had already explained to Perry that in hard-boiled novels the detective always takes on two separate assignments only to discover later that they are intertwined. The movie is full of knowing self-referential moments like this and those with a limited appetite for irony may wish to steer clear. For the rest of us however Black has assembled a delightfully crafty ride a film that succeeds as both paragon and parody of its genre better than any other since the Scream franchise. In addition to the many noirish references (the ""chapters"" for example are named after Chandler stories ""The Lady in the Lake"" ""The Little Sister"" etc.) the movie offers nods to cultural artifacts as varied as The Natural Elmo from Sesame Street Robocop Colin Farrell ""My Friend Flicka"" and Pauline Kael whose 1968 criticism collection Kiss Kiss Bang Bang supplies the films title. Yet for all the wisecrackery and in-jokes Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is true enough to its hard-boiled origins that it never plays as mere spoof. The death of Harmonys sister the way Harrys sexual gallantry is sometimes indiscernible from misogyny the quiet suggestion that some people may have compromised themselves too much ever to be made whole again--all of these echo the pitiless tone of Chandler and his successors. Though frequently hysterical Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is seldom just a walk in the park. (The one actual walk in the park that takes place--in MacArthur Park to be precise--concludes in a barrage of gunfire.) In different hands this awkward mixture might have been disastrous. But Downey seamlessly integrates the sweet and sour in Blacks script. Like the movie itself his Harry careens a bit hedonistic one moment and judgmental the next. But his tics and inconsistencies are washed away by an incessant self-deprecating patter as if the spirit of Woody Allen were animating the mouth of Philip Marlowe. Just as Harry is an improvisational character--a thief pretending to be an actor pretending to be a detective--Downey delivers an improvisational performance an extended riff in the syncopated self-correcting rhythms of eternal insecurity. Indeed there are times the whole movie almost feels like the monologue of a performance artist Downey is in nearly every scene of the film and when hes physically absent his role as narrator gives him an almost greater stature. But for all his virtuosity Downey isnt a soloist. On the contrary he seems especially attuned to his costars who perhaps partly as a result are exceptionally good. Kilmers Perry may be gay but in narrative terms hes the straight man and Kilmer portrays him with deadpan assurance never falling back on comic stereotype. Kilmer has always been talented (just not quite so talented as hes imagined himself to be) and its nice to be reminded what he can do when he plays off his fellow performers allowing the action to come to him rather than trying to generate it all himself. (The last time he was this generous may have been 1992s Thunderheart.) As for Monaghan she constitutes a find. The film was clearly intended as a Downey-Kilmer buddy movie with her in a secondary role. But Monaghan (who resembles a tougher sexier Ellen Pompeo) forces her way into the boys room bringing enough wit and grit to her character that its a shock when shes abruptly written out of the script at the end. (For her sins she got to play Tom Cruises wife in Mission Impossible III; yes onscreen as well as off Tom wants to assure us hes the marrying kind.) For Shane Black meanwhile Kiss Kiss Bang Bang offers a second chance to make a first impression. In the 1990s he became synonymous with Hollywood excess for his action screenplays--The Last Boy Scout The Last Action Hero The Long Kiss Goodnight--and the million-dollar fees he received for them. But after a decade of quiet he has returned with something very different and vastly more appealing. The cover of the Kiss Kiss Bang Bang DVD captures the incongruity advertising that the film is ""from the creator of Lethal Weapon."" Its intended as a boast of course. Yet its hard not to view this quirky literate send-up as something more closely resembling an apology. Youre forgiven Shane. The Home Movies List Comic Capers The Imposters (1998). There are no criminals posing as actors in writer/director/star Stanley Tuccis delightful throwback farce but instead actors driven to con artistry. The latter half of the movie is a tad uneven but Tucci and costar Oliver Platt are superb throughout and an early scene in a pastry shop is a comic gem.Murder By Death (1976). A broad but witty spoof of the classic murder mystery and the rare film with an all-star cast that actually lives up to its billing. Peter Sellers and Alec Guinness are excellent in the early going but in the end it is Peter Falks Sam Spade routine that steals the movie. Play It Again Sam (1972). Not Woody Allen animating Marlowes mouth but essentially the reverse with Allen taking romantic advice from the ghost of Humphrey Bogart. Allen adapted the movie from his own hit play--and reunited virtually its entire cast--but surrendered directorial duties to Herbert Ross who gives the film a clearer structure and more winsome tone than Allens earlier gag-driven comedies. Charade (1963). The comedy-thriller that Hitchcock never directed but should have. Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn are both at their iconic best (even if he was a bit long in the tooth for this particular romance) and director Stanley Donen moves the proceedings along with a deftness not even the Master of Suspense could have faulted. A film every bit as much worth seeing as its toxic remake The Truth About Charlie is worth avoiding. The Ladykillers (1955). Not the funniest of Alec Guinnesss comedies for Ealing Studios (nor even necessarily of his caper movies with The Lavender Hill Mob perhaps edging it out) but arguably the most endearing. Guinness displays an understated depravity as a criminal mastermind and Katie Johnson is marvelous as the dotty landlady drawn into his plot. Another movie worth seeing; another remake worth skipping. This post originally appeared at TNR.com.

Twitter previousGuantanamo and KafkanextGuantanamo and Kafka II Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics. Continue Reading Tom Pennington / Getty Images The Mind of Donald Trump Dan P. McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Lucy Nicholson / Reuters Trump Time Capsule 65 Id Like to Hear His Wife Say Something James Fallows None The most personally moving and most fundamentally patriotic moment of the Democratic National Convention was the appearance by the bereaved parents of Army Captain Humayun Khan and the statement about the meaning of their sons life and death and about the Constitution by Mr. Khizr Khan. After Khizr Khan spoke politicians and commentators on most networks said they were moved humbled inspired choked up. (Commentators on Fox did not say these things because their coverage cut away from the Khans for Brit Hume and Megyn Kelly plus a Benghazi ad.) Continue Reading Gary Cameron / Reuters Trump Time Capsule 62 A Man Who Can Be Baited With a Tweet James Fallows None Last night in her overall very successful acceptance speech Hillary Clinton said with ruthless precision about her opponent Ask yourself Does Donald Trump have the temperament to be Commander-in-Chief? Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion. Continue Reading carianoff/flickr Why Some People Respond to Stress by Falling Asleep Elijah Wolfson Fight or flight or sleep Last month my wife and I found ourselves in a disagreement about whether or not our apartment was clean enough for guests--the type of medium-sized disagreement that likely plagues all close relationships. In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

Once there was even a transsexual rock opera starring a lady with an Adams apple ""Hedlamp and the ..."" something something. Drat. Long-term memory shot. Blame Michael Bay. That always works. Todays assignment ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" an innovative film noir spoof that a more sentimental man might say was ""satisfyingly zany"" and ""cocked and loaded for laughs."" Shane Black wrote and directed it. Hes the kid who penned ""Lethal Weapon"" back in the 80s made mountains of scratch in the 90s and promptly went into Hollywood hibernation for eight years. (Not to study the Bible if my sources are correct.) The way I reckon Black is going for something different here Tinseltown-insider intrigue (think Robert Altmans ""The Player"") meets the mean streets chatter of a pulpy paperback detective novel meets ""The Naked Gun."" Robert Downey Jr. plays the hero lovable New York crook Harry Lockhart (he steals toys for his nephew ... hows that for lovable?). In one of those art-becomes-life mix-ups that used to be Mel Brooks shtick Harry is mistaken for an actor and whisked to L.A. to audition for a big movie role. And then the fun begins. First Harry - a lippy kind of guy; good with his wits not his fists - gets paired up with gay private eye Perry Van Shrike (Val Kilmer) to do research for the role. Then he runs into childhood crush Harmony Lane (Michelle Monaghan from ""North Country"") now a struggling B-movie actress. Then he witnesses a murder linked to Harmonys dead sister linked to a shady producer (Corbin Bernsen) linked to some ""Chinatown""-inspired luridness best left under the rose. As the star and narrator Downey is good doing his thing. Talking fast. Talking parenthetically. Withering. Sarcastic. Midway through Harry makes a crack about a ""native American Joe Pesci"" that makes me want to wet my pants. If Downey is the movies Riggs (Mel Gibsons insane cop in ""Lethal Weapon"") Kilmer is ... another Riggs. Everyone is Riggs in this movie addled and frantic waged in desperate contests to spit out apt metaphors and movie allusions like baseball players perched on the steps of a dugout hawking sunflower seeds. Nothing wrong with that. Noir characters are supposed to talk funny. Like Fred MacMurray in ""Double Indemnity"" ""Baby"" this and ""baby"" that. Baby baby baby. ""Kiss Kiss"" is such a delightful bombardment we barely notice that Blacks convoluted serpentine plot doesnt make a lick of sense. Go figure. Theres a nice sense of justice here too - that the guy who practically sired the modern buddy picture two decades ago should give the genre its freshest treatment in years.Contact the writer (800) 536-3251 or couthierfreedom.com Most Popular Costa Mesa Police detail homeowners 2012 fatal shooting of burglar -- caper involved artGrocery Outlet debut Free Bruxie lunch for shoppers next week in OrangeDodgers Yasiel Puig remains in limbo as trade deadline nears; Jay Bruce a possible targeTim Lincecums struggles continue in Angels 6-2 loss to Red SoxEarly Trump supporter changes her tune User Agreement Comments are encouraged but you must follow our Privacy Policy Policy amp; Terms of Use Keep it civil and stay on topic.

Niki (""Whale Rider"") Caros intermittently stirring drama is loosely based on a true story.

Illusion and reality further collide when Harry falls for an aspiring actress (Michelle Monaghan) then witnesses a murder and finds himself dodging real bullets. Jumpy and ironic Downey is a quicksilver delight and Kilmer is funny as the gay Perry. But Blacks inventive self-conscious script--heavy on voice-over narration--can be too clever for its own good.

Watching the IMAX version was like wearing a pair of them and now the morning after its as if theyre still beaming images to my brain. I cant vouch for the merely wide-screen version that opens next week but the action sequences shot in IMAX--one-quarter of the film opening today--lift this fourth installment of the near-venerable series from impressive action to spectacular abstraction. Its not the generic plot thats so memorable even though its convolutions are clever enough or the cast of mostly interesting characters but the surreal swirl of form and color that frequently fills the enormous screen. ENLARGE Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible--Ghost Protocol. Paramount Pictures The best stuff transpires and perspires in Dubai. What brings the IMF team to that emirates skyscrapered sands is their search for a madman who plans to launch a nuclear missile that will plunge the world into nuclear war. (If the plot was good enough for James its good enough for Ethan.) The search starts in Moscow where the team is wrongly blamed for a blast that destroys much of the Kremlin--not just blamed but officially disavowed and effectively reduced to the status of ghostly rogues--and it extends to Mumbai by way of fulfilling the franchises supercharged-travelogue function. The IMF is shut down when its implicated in the bombing of the Kremlin causing Ethan Hunt and his new team to go rogue to clear their organizations name. Video courtesy of Paramount. Still Dubai is where Ethan scales the worlds tallest building the Burj Khalifa and where the IMAX camera records his human-fly escapade in wondrously dense yet expansive detail. One shot alone is almost worth the price of admission its when Ethan goes out a window and the camera follows him then pivots and soars above him to take in the building the climber and the whole panorama of urbanized desert. ""Ghost Protocol"" is the live-action debut of Brad Bird who has directed no less than three animated masterpieces ""The Iron Giant"" ""The Incredibles"" and ""Ratatouille."" This film is no masterpiece; all-too-familiar elements of the action-adventure genre animate the script by Andre Nemec and Josh Appelbaum. But Mr. Bird and his cinematographer Robert Elswit sustain a remarkable level of visual and dramatic energy in scenes that exult in exotic settings edgy architecture and quirky behavior. (The production designer was James D. Bissell. Michael Giacchino did the powerful score. The editor was Paul Hirsch.) In a tale that also relies on face-recognition gizmos--theyre deployed as casually as dental floss--the most readily recognizable face belongs to the star whose features have matured and coarsened with the passage of time. Hes become an abstraction too an eerily Tom Cruise-like figure who runs jumps smiles and frowns with a devotion to IMF duty thats always entertaining and sometimes downright touching. The excellent actors around him include Jeremy Renner as Brandt an agent who knows more about whats possible than he lets on (and who may take Ethans place in the franchise should Mr. Cruise refuse any more of these missions); Simon Pegg as Benji Dunn the teams whimsical computer whiz; Paula Patton as the buff and fearless Agent Jane Carter; Michael Nyqvist as the megalomaniacal villain Hendricks (its not the fault of Mr. Nyqvist who played the journalist in the original Swedish screen adaptation of Stieg Larssons Millennium trilogy that this villain as written is insufficiently villainous); Anil Kapoor (the volcanic quiz show host in ""Slumdog Millionaire"") as a lecherous Mumbai billionaire; and most mysteriously because most seductively without visible effort Lea Seydoux as a dangerously for-profit operative named Sabine Moreau. The movies schizoid attitude toward its fancy technology mirrors our own. On the one hand the IMF team members know just as well as we do that intricate systems and machines are vulnerable to intricate failure; their efforts to avert nuclear annihilation fail ignominiously before they succeed. On the other hand they invest those machines with limitless power just as we are more than willing to go along with breaking access codes instantly locating quarries almost infallibly (even in a sand storm) taking over the entire operation of an immense building by hacking its central computer or rendering an alternate reality--as in the computer-animation sense of rendering--with little more than a laptop and a portable screen. ""Mission Impossible"" has always been about alternate realities and this episode gave Mr. Bird a chance to render a huge one with live people as his incredibles. The result is hugely enjoyable. Carnage ENLARGE Christoph Waltz and Kate Winslet in Carnage. Sony Pictures Classics A claustrophobic quartet for strident voices ""Carnage"" was adapted from Yasmina Rezas play ""God of Carnage"" and directed by Roman Polanski who collaborated with the playwright on the script. As in the original two ostensibly enlightened couples meet for a civilized discussion of a schoolyard fight that involved their respective sons then fall to fighting among themselves with infantile savagery. The Broadway production starred James Gandolfini Marcia Gay Harden Jeff Daniels and Hope Davis. Most of the people I know who saw it--I did not--came away delighted by the acting if not the writing though many thought well of both. The screen version stars Jodie Foster Kate Winslet Christoph Waltz and John C. Reilly. I was put off by the acting or more properly by the spectacle of good actors dutifully following leaden direction and equally by the writing which is as thin as the veneer of civilization it purports to peel back. A dark comedy directed by Roman Polanksi. Two sets of parents work out the issues after their sons get into an altercation on the playground. Video courtesy of The Weinstein Company. ""Were all decent people"" says Mr. Reillys Michael Longstreet. Three of the four seem to be Michael a hardware salesman; his wife Penelope (Ms. Foster) an occasional writer of do-good prose; and Nancy Cowan (Ms. Winslet) a smart investment broker. The clear exception is Nancys husband Alan (Mr. Waltz) a lawyer of dubious probity who keeps using his cell phone to advise an unscrupulous client. But Alan turns out to be the only truth-teller--""Nobody cares about anything outside themself"" he tells Penelope bluntly if not grammatically--and the others bear him out by baring the hostility that stokes their desperate souls. ""God of Carnage"" has been compared--loosely and overgenerously I believe--to the classic four-part disharmonies of Edward Albees ""Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf."" Similar sentiments may greet the film. Mr. Waltz comes closest to being genuinely funny; hes a sly actor as well as a fine one and the ironies of his character allow him some restraint. But the unsubtleties of the script--gleeful displays of glib hypocrisy--compounded by two broad performances plus Ms. Fosters excruciatingly shrill one make ""Carnage"" a puppet show with a misanthropic puppeteer. Sherlock Holmes A Game of Shadows Detective Sherlock Holmes and his stalwart partner Watson engage in a battle of wits and brawn with a nemesis whose plot is a threat to all of England. Video courtesy of Warners. ENLARGE Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law in Sherlock Holmes A Game of Shadows. Warner Bros. Pictures Two years ago Robert Downey Jr. reinvented himself--re-reinvented himself having done the same thing in ""Iron Man""--as Sherlock Holmes. His vehicle was an imaginative feature film directed by Guy Ritchie that made Arthur Conan Doyles Victorian detective a martial artist with precarious mental balance paired him with Jude Laws witty Dr. Watson and gave him an intriguingly ambiguous relationship with a beautiful criminal Rachel McAdamss Irene Adler. Now the two men are back along with Irene. But she vanishes all too soon in this overproduced self-enchanted sequel and so does the spirit of bright invention that made the previous film such a pleasant surprise. In Irenes place is a mysterious Gypsy named Sim; shes played by Noomi Rapace who was unforgettably Lisbeth Salander in the original Millennium trilogy. Here in her first English-speaking role Ms. Rapace has little to do but accompany Holmes and Watson as they race across France Germany and Switzerland in an effort to stop the criminal mastermind Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris) from plunging the world into war. (No he doesnt have a nuclear missile.) ""Hidden within the unconscious is an insatiable desire for conflict"" Moriarty intones at a crucial point. Maybe so but theres also a desire for coherence and humanity in movies. This one doesnt feed it. DVD Focus ENLARGE Mission Impossible (1996) Movie technology has come a long way since this first feature-film version of the television series. Still the director Brian de Palma stages one set piece of unrivaled elegance. It has Tom Cruise hovering above a keyboard like a spaceman at the end of his tether as he tries to crack the central computer at the CIA. This task is undertaken in utter silence like the break-in in ""Rififi"" but with humor that evokes the one in ""Topkapi."" If the presence of a rat doesnt blow the job it looks like a bead of sweat will. The Hurt Locker (2009) Jeremy Renner is Sgt. First Class William James a man who has a special relationship with bombs in the Oscar-winning drama that Kathryn Bigelow directed from a script by Mark Boal. The film is many things at once--a first-rate thriller a vivid evocation of warfare in Iraq a penetrating study of heroism and a showcase for austere technique terse writing and brilliant performances. Most of all though it demonstrates in a brutally hot and dusty laboratory setting how the drug of war hooks its victims and why they cant kick the habit. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005) Robert Downey Jr. is fully returned to form after a notoriously enforced absence in Shane Blacks buoyant comedy. That is to say hes the quickest sharpest slyest and wryest comic actor on the screen. He plays Harry Lockhart a petty crook from New York who by lurid inadvertence is taken first for an actor then for a private eye. Mr. Downeys co-stars are revelations too Val Kilmer all synapses firing furiously as a genuine albeit fuzzily focused private eye who likes to call himself Gay Perry and Michelle Monaghan as a perpetually aspiring actress named Harmony Faith Lane.

Comments Kiss Kiss Bang Bang Rated R  102 minutes  2005 Screenwriter Shane Black (Lethal Weapon Last Action Hero) makes his directing debut with this cheerful mess of a pulp-fiction parody pumped full of laughs by Michelle Monaghan Val Kilmer and Robert Downey Jr. An east-coast thief (Downey) is improbably lured out west for a screen test and schooled for his role by a gay private eye (Kilmer); after the crook encounters an old childhood friend (Monaghan) the three are drawn into a convoluted web of intrigue. Downeys character provides voice-over narration a task he mocks along with the storys other pulp conventions; when the structure is this rickety crashing through the fourth wall isnt a bad idea.

His directorial debut is an ultra-knowing contemporary take on the naive gumshoe procedural with Downey on deliciously rumpled form as a two-bit thief marooned in LA and mixed up in murder. Less clued-up tec than richocheting pinball hes ably assisted by Monaghans old flame and Kilmers Gay Perry a more accomplished private dick. The self-aware narration and formal trickery are ultimately window-dressing but a very enjoyable way to have your genre cake and eat it too.

"`Kiss Kiss Bang Bang Fast fun brutal amoral - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Lethal Weapon `Kiss Kiss Bang Bang Fast fun brutal amoralmovies - reviewNovember 11 2005|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie CriticKiss Kiss Bang Bang said the Italian movie poster a translation that ignored the original American title and got straight to the point.Kiss Kiss Bang Bang wrote the great critic Pauline Kael who saw that poster and titled one of her collections of reviews that.And Kiss Kiss Bang Bang wrote Shane ""Lethal Weapon"" Black a writer turned writer-director who wanted to sum up everything he has learned about wiseacre buddy comedies and trigger-happy and bloody detective movies.Black who hasnt been heard from much since the debacles of The Last Boy Scout and Last Action Hero in the 90s boils down a detective novel by Brett Halliday and everything he knows about sassy dialogue and gunplay-as-comedy for this two-fisted firefight. The joke title for it might be Lethal Weapon 5 but the Lethal Weapons never had one-liners this sharp; a brave super-competent gay detective; or a plot as overplotted as Kiss Kiss.This is the movie to put on Shane Blacks tombstone.Robert Downey Jr. stars as Harry Lockhart a small-time crook turned actor ""Ill be your narrator tonight.""Harry and his burgling accomplice get into a gunfight (Harry doesnt carry); the friend is killed. And Harrys getaway takes him into an audition. Next thing you know hes in Los Angeles ""Welcome to the party"" going to detective school looking at the possible lead in a major motion picture.His instructor? Val Kilmer as Perry a k a ""Gay Perry"" as in ""Gay Paree"" (Paris). Hes the shameless shamus whos supposed to show Harry the trade.""This business?"" Perry growls. ""Real life? Boring.""Perry tries to keep Harry from spitting out those inane sure-to-get-you-beat-up threats like ""Walk away. Dont think. Just do it.""Harrys childhood friend Harmony (Michelle Monaghan) has been trying to make it as an actress. Harmonys sister is mixed up in something that gets her killed and next thing you know Harry and Harmony are getting on-the-case lessons in hardball.Black has concocted a zany detective dramedy a jokey nocturnal Chinatown and an amazingly amusingly verbose movie all banter and hard-as-nails detective cliches.Its a movie-savvy film joking through the City of Wannabes as a place where everybody looks like -- or wants to look like -- somebody famous. Check out ""Punk Rock Steven Seagal"" ""Native American Joe Pesci"" or ""Brazilian Billy Bob Thornton.""Downey lets himself go all haggard to play this utterly inept but quick-with-a-line stumble-bum. And Kilmer plays a gay man with no gay cliches. Well aside from his choice of guns.Speaking of that a recent study linked the smoking kids see in the movies with behavior they want to imitate. Take or leave the cigarettes in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. Its the pistols that beg for imitation here. Everybody will want a gun after watching the way dangerous situations interrogations and disagreements over driving are resolved quickly brutally and efficiently without the presence of L.A.s finest.Yeah its amoral in exactly the way the Lethal Weapons were. Theres a ""girl"" to ""get"" in the end (Monaghan is pretty cool) a web of intrigues that have to be tied together and tidied up (with guns) and a droll narrated walk off into the sunset. But even thats a movie joke and a movie joke that works""Dont worry. I saw the last Lord of the Rings. Im not going to have the movie end 17 times.""

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post A lot less kiss-kissing than bang-banging takes place in writer-director Shane Blacks winking homage to the detective flick starring Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer. Much of ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bangs"" pleasing rat-a-tat- tat comes thanks to Downey. Its not gunplay though. Instead very petty thief turned Hollywood hopeful Harry Lockhart just cant help shooting his mouth off in bursts and volleys. When Los Angeles private eye Perry van Shrike (Kilmer) finally puts his hand to Harrys mouth you gotta thank him for doing what we cant. Not that we really want Harry to shut up. That would mean dialing down Downeys crazed work. We just want his portrayer to catch his breath so we can catch ours. Harry hasnt got time to suck in air. Hes the narrator of this story about a guy (him) who lands in Los Angeles where he is being groomed for a detective movie. As the movie begins Harry stands poolside recounting how he ""got to the party."" (Something about an escape that turned into a screen test.) This particular soiree takes place at the digs of millionaire Harlan Dexter (Corbin Bern- sen). Dexters estranged daughter has returned from Paris. Theyve reconciled and she has dropped a lawsuit against him. At the party Harry runs into but doesnt recognize childhood friend and crush Harmony Faith Lane (Michelle Monaghan) who journeyed from their hometown seeking stardom. Of course by ""party"" Harry also means Los Angeles. ""You Wouldnt Want to Live Here"" is the title of one of the Jonny Gossamer pulp thrillers Harmony devoured as a little girl growing up in Indiana. Its also a non-too-subtle comment on the L.A. that these characters find themselves in. (There are few more enjoyable ways to celebrate L.A. while dissing it than film noir. The genre and its progeny have had their way with Lala Land for decades now.) Also at the party Harry meets van Shrike. Known around town as Gay Perry because he likes the fellas van Shrike is an on-call consultant for motion pictures. He takes Harry on a job that ends with a car plunging into a pond a female corpse in a trunk and two hooded guys on a bluff above. Whos the girl? Why was she killed? The murder and the arrival and sad departure of Harmonys kid sister get tied into ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bangs"" knotted narrative in ways that keep Harry Perry and Harmony busy and us guessing. From its hipster opening credits to its final confiding flourish ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" flaunts its ultra-awareness. A movie this clever about film noir this familiar with L.A. hucksterism this fluid with its postmodern tricks risks being gimmicky. Sometimes it is. Yet even when it is its hard not to grin at the movies excess. When Harrys recounts a story about Harmony the flashback slows then stops between frames. Wait he needs to add an aside. At the movies core beat strong performances from two gifted but notoriously tormented performers. If ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" is more ""Thin Man"" than ""Mal- tese Falcon"" then Harry and Perry are Nick and Nora. Which ones Nora? Not Perry who can out-butch the best of them. Its nattering nervous Harry. Film noir has always contemplated male sexual anxieties. Dear genre thank you very much for the femme fatale. Women still vex here. But updated for the times ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" plays fast and loose with an anxiety that dares speak its name. Writer-director Black became a Tinseltown legend when as a very young man he wrote ""Lethal Weapon."" ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" is the more than confident directorial debut of a scribe still thrilled with words. A running gag about grammar and the quirks of adverbs will make copy editors everywhere slap-happy. And any movie that uses the famously misused ""nonplus"" and makes a joke of the pluperfect is a flick that enjoys language. ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" is crass and crude and loves every minute of it. Theres enough doubling and double-entendres to give one vertigo. In the Gossamer novels there were always 16 dead bodies. I didnt count the toll here but Im betting the numbers add up.  | ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" R for language violence and sexuality/nudity|1 hour 43 minutes|NOIR SENDUP|Written and directed by Shane Black; photography by Michael Barrett; starring Robert Downey Jr. Val Kilmer Michelle Monaghan Corbin Bernsen|Opens today at area theaters.

Robert Downey Jr. provides a voice-over (""Ill be your narrator"" he intros to the audience) playing Harry Lockhart a con artist turned movie actor signed to play a private eye.The directorial debut of L.A. screenwriter Shane Black (the Lethal Weapon series) Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is steeped in attitude - a smart-alecky insider sarcasm that can be pretty clever at times but also pretty insufferable. The meta-ness of the proceedings extends to the chapter headings lifted wholesale from the Chandler oeuvre ""Trouble Is My Business"" ""The Simple Art of Murder"" and so forth.While Downeys rumpled insouciance jibes with the movies jaded narcissistic tone its a hard tone to take for a hundred minutes or so. Val Kilmer of all people is brought in for comic relief doing a funny stab as a gay detective who has been hired to teach Lockhart the ins and outs of the business. (And who keeps a Derringer on his person in a most unique hiding place.) Michelle Monaghan stars as the dromedary in Harrys life - a high school muse moved to Hollywood.Kiss Kiss Bang Bang has a plot denser than vintage San Fernando Valley smog and not even its stars can make sense of it - though they try in breezy explanations delivered in a rat-tat-tat style with a so-what shrug.Contact movie critic Steven Reaat 215-854-5629 or seaphillynews.com.Kiss Kiss Bang Bang 1/2 (out of four stars)Written and directed by Shane Black.

Pictures Kiss gives props to pulp genre while satirizing it 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Kiss Kiss Bang Bang Action comedy. Starring Robert Downey Jr. Val Kilmer and Michelle Monaghan. Directed by Shane Black. (R. 103 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Writer-director Shane Black knows detective movies and pulp fiction inside out. In ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" he takes all the elements and scenes that have become staples of these genres and changes them slightly so that we get a hard-boiled narrator but not quite; a tense Russian roulette scene but not exactly; and a scene in which the hero defends a ladys honor with a slightly unexpected result. These changes and others are worked to comic and sometimes hilarious effect. Yet its the wonder of ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" that despite its comic moments and its constant winking at the audience it still succeeds in dramatic terms. Its still an exciting-enough thriller. Black who wrote the original ""Lethal Weapon"" walks that line and its not an easy line. That he manages it has something to do with instinct something to do with experience something to do with flair -- but really what were talking about here is talent that cruel and random thing. There is so much talent on display in ""Kiss Kiss"" that it will annoy some people. Its a smarty-pants movie full of wise attitude and cute genre references. Thats fine. People who dislike smarty-pants movies can skip this one. There are plenty of stupid-pants movies to choose from. Related Stories Hilarious dramatic smarty-pants thriller Robert Downey Jr. stars as a petty thief from New York who is mistaken for an actor and sent to Los Angeles for possible work on a movie. The circumstances of the casting directors confusion make for the first laugh-out-loud moment in the picture. Now Harry (Downey) is walking around a Hollywood party. Its night; theres a pool and there are plenty of strange people some imitating human beings some not even trying. Though its all couched in comedy its about as bleak a representation of socializing as anything on film. Black establishes the tone early. Harrys self-conscious narration is full of stops and starts digressions and corrections and a couple of times the film freezes and goes backward or shifts to another scene that should have been mentioned earlier. Harrys not a good narrator he tells us but hes the only one weve got. But Black doesnt just spoof classic Hollywood style; he emulates it. With an economy bordering on the obvious he uses the party to introduce all the key characters the most important of which are Perry a gay detective played by Val Kilmer and Harmony (Michelle Monaghan) an actress whose career is going nowhere. Harry takes one look at Harmony and falls in love then realizes that he knew her in high school and was crazy about her then too. Monaghan and Downey hardly look as if they could have been schoolmates. The movie could have accounted for the discrepancy by saying that she spent 10 years cryogenically frozen or that he spent that long eating nothing but toxic waste. Instead Black chooses not to explain it and soon the reason for their casting becomes apparent Their comic rhythms are in perfect synch. At times it seems as if theyre improvising inspiring and topping each other. Harry and Harmony share an affinity for old-time crime fiction -- specifically for fictitious novels featuring the Los Angeles detective Jonny Gossamer -- a predilection that Black shrewdly weaves into a complicated story involving the deaths of two women. By having the characters talk about the Gossamer novels Black telegraphs whats going to happen later in the movie. In a particularly mischievous moment he all but announces the ending in advance at an early stage when such an ending is unimaginable. Black is calling attention to his own virtuosity which would be obnoxious if he couldnt back it up. But he can. ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" mocks celebrates wallows in and ultimately exemplifies the allure of the traditional Hollywood formula. Pauline Kael used the title ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" for one of her collections of film reviews because she considered it a succinct summary of the movies appeal. Blacks postmodern take lives up to its title though an added ""Laugh Laugh"" might have said it all. -- Advisory This film contains nudity sexual situations and violence.

"Happy Danes Shopgirl Shines | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Style amp; Design Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Happy Danes Shopgirl Shines By Rex Reed  10/31/05 1200am In the sudden plethora of faceless film stars with more publicity than talent Claire Danes is a shining exception. With her wistful and querulous combination of distant longing and in-the-moment sensitivity she is never less than totally committed to every role. Usually erasing her leading men from memory in a single radiant smile she has a wan but intelligent beauty and she can act. Shopgirl adapted by Steve Martin from his novella is about a May-December love affair between an older man (sensibly and attractively played by Mr. Martin with plenty of sincerity and no shtick) and a girl young enough to be his daughter. They share the screen but the movie is really more of a valentine to Claire Danes. She accepts it gracefully. Lonely and unfocused college graduate Mirabelle Buttersfield (Ms. Danes) moves from Vermont to Los Angeles to pursue an art career but to pay off her student loan she is forced to take a job selling gloves at Saks. During the day she watches waxed zombies from Beverly Hills stretching their mitts into elegant leather she cant afford; at night she goes home to a modest little apartment where her cat eats better than she does. Suddenly there are two men in her life--well make that one man and a hairy doofus who shows no sign of ever passing puberty. The older man is Ray Porter a wealthy successful and divorced Lochinvar who is charming odd coldly distant and played with exquisite elegance by Mr. Martin. (Why not? He created the role for himself and studied all the angles.) Ray sizes up Mirabelle at Saks and showers her with gifts offering the reassuring warmth of a father figure without the promise of any long-term commitment. Simultaneously she is also romanced by a cretin she meets in a laundromat named Jeremy played by the almost terminally creepy Jason Schwartzman who specializes in freaks who speak in grunts and appear to be submental. Small wonder she chooses the older man since the audience has already chosen him for her. Jeremy is a meathead slacker whose job is a blank (something about designing logos) and whose future is even bleaker. Ray knows how to make a wallflower feel like a debutante and when he takes her to bed she sees visions of security that shopgirls on breadline budgets only dream about. But Ray is dogged by problems of his own. Hes afraid of women once theyve been seduced he cant show true tenderness and theres always a glint in his eye in a crowded room that suggests he may be looking for the next best thing. Only as the film progresses and Ms. Danes grows from Bridget Jones to Anna Karenina do we see how vulnerable Mirabelle really is and how deeply Ray lets her down. The fact that she eventually reunites with the oafish Jeremy is a letdown (she deserves better) but even he seems to have taken a toddlers step toward maturity He buys a razor and a toothbrush. Carefully constructed by Mr. Martin the Shopgirl screenplay retains the authors sophisticated literary sensibility and is well served by director Anand Tucker to give a realistic picture of a young woman floating in the cheesy neon pudding of Los Angeles where individuals struggle to forge meaningful relationships in an atmosphere of superficial values. The fact that the film takes its time involving you in the lives of its characters is to Mr. Martins credit. The leisurely pace is comforting as cashmere. I liked Shopgirl a lot mainly because its heart is in the right place and because it is so refreshingly unpretentious. Ms. Danes never makes a wrong move. The camera responds accordingly caressing her movements gazing adoringly into her moist eyes and enhancing her talent the way Frank Borzage celebrated Margaret Sullavan in the close-ups. For Mr. Martin this is a welcome change of pace after years of regrettably dumb comedies that rely on sight gags for laughs instead of human foibles. Ive always preferred his serious side; from the evidence of his books hes a thoughtful man and in the character of Ray he has drawn from his best instincts as an actor. Ray is wise and nurturing but weak when it comes to emotional strength; hes a man who feels deeply but cant show it except in material ways. (What a disaster this movie would be with a blank cartridge like Bill Murray in the lead.) Classy and suave Mr. Martin is a babe magnet for the kind of girl who wants a lover and a dad all rolled into one but how many bottles of perfume does it take to make her feel needed? Although he loves Mirabelle in his way Rays kind of love doesnt have forever written on it. When she sees the light I get the feeling that her heartbreak will be temporary. Jeremy appeals in a different way because he loves her unselfishly. He might be an idiot but he wants all of her not just little fragments. Shopgirl seems to be saying that not loving in the same tempo will undeniably lead to loss but in a cockeyed reversal of the sexes its reassuring to see a movie in which its the older man who dumps the younger girl instead of the other way around. There are no villains and no victims here just likeable people bruised by their own sensitivity. The people at Disneys Touchstone Pictures havent got a clue how to release sell market or publicize a film this special so it will probably get lost in the overcrowded autumn shuffle. This will be a shame of course. Soft and muted and irresistibly warm Shopgirl is a feel-good movie that lingers. Jacks Back It gives me pleasure to welcome back Michelangelo Antonionis 1975 masterwork The Passenger re-released for a new generation to savor. This is a stunning sobering film experience with some of the most breathtaking camera work it has been my privilege to see. The film is full of metaphor and cynicism but its impact is astonishing. Jack Nicholson is magnificent as David Locke a hack reporter doing a documentary on North African guerrillas unhappy with his life disillusioned with his work frustrated and exhausted as he approaches burnout. His moment of truth comes in a sand-swept village hotel surrounded by silence heat and bugs crawling on the plumbing. The whir of a ceiling fan is the only sound he hears. In the next room a man dies. Locke steals his passport plane ticket and identity. People disappear from the film every time they leave a room yet remain the same even in foreign zones--translating everything into their own personal codes of experience. Very puzzling stuff yet bracing in its eventual clarity of vision. The point of The Passenger (and Mr. Antonionis psychic philosophy) is that life is not worth living. Trade in your own for a different model and youll only discover that nobody elses life is worth living either. I dont agree so the film becomes ultimately depressing when Mr. Antonioni insists that I do. But the mystery ambiguity and inner passion unrequited are gorgeously telegraphed through visual terms in Mr. Antonionis best film after The Red Desert. The Passenger has lost none of its power in 30 years. It exists on two levels In a commercial adventurous sense it is an exciting mystery of chance with Locke embarking on a new life only to discover as he keeps the dead mans appointments that he is a gun-runner in immediate danger from unknown enemies as well as his pursuing wife and employers. (Mr. Nicholsons perpetual look of a mangy dog whose fur has been rubbed by calloused hands in the wrong direction has never served him better.) On a starker level its an investigation of illusions and dreams in an ambiance of surreal disposition and mood. The quest for life turns ironically into an odyssey of suicide. Not for the TV crowd but a sober and rewarding film worthy of the same attention and time it received the first time around. The more I reflect on it the more it grows on me like a lichen. Downey and Out The title says it all Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is vulgar noisy pointless and stupid. This dismal masturbatory fantasy marks the directing debut of Shane Black the one-dimensional hack who typed out such drivel as The Last Boy Scout The Long Kiss Goodnight and two Lethal Weapons. In Hollywood if you drink enough latte and type fast enough and promise to finish up by Thursday you too can become a director. Apparently nobody bothers to read the scripts anymore. Robert Downey Jr. plays Harry the thief-narrator who starts off by sawing a girl in half in a kiddie carnival in Indiana. Years later while robbing a toy store in New York he gets shot and his partner is killed while doing their Christmas shopping after closing hours. Fleeing from the police Harry escapes into a room where auditions are being held for a movie about a petty thief whose partner is killed during a heist and ... you get the picture. Mistaken for an actor Harry is so good at this art-imitating-life crap that (naturally with no experience and this being a Hollywood movie) the producers fly him to L.A. for a chance at stardom. A hopelessly miscast and depressingly humorless Val Kilmer plays ""Gay Perry"" a homosexual detective assigned to coach and prepare Harry for his screen test. At a zonked-out Hollywood party this mismatched team meets Harmony (Michelle Monaghan currently being seen to better advantage in North Country) who grew up on a robot comic strip called Protocop. When the guy who played Protocop in the screen version accidentally falls to his death from her balcony in his Protocop costume she drags Harry into a murder mystery so bizarre and implausible it comes right out of the slush pile in Quentin Tarantinos wastebasket. From a Cuisinart of ideas borrowed begged and stolen from a long line of better movies like The Big Sleep and Chinatown a pureed plot unravels in which Harmony turns out to be the girl Harry sawed in half back in Indiana Harry locks lips with Harmony Perry locks lips with Harry and the contrived idiocy is illustrated by so much surreal camerawork (red skies and blue buildings) and preposterous metaphysical set designs that the whole movie seems positively schizophrenic. All of it is matched by the kind of incompetent over-the-top posing that passes for acting in Shane Black movies (Val Kilmer as a butch queen reaches some kind of new low even by Hollywood standards) as well as truly lousy dialogue (""I was tired ... I was pissed ... I was wetter than Drew Barrymore at a grunge club"") that sounds like Philip Marlowe on Quaaludes. For laughs Mr. Downey is tortured by electrical wires attached to his genitals Ms. Monaghan cuts his finger off a dog eats it before he reaches the hospital to sew it back on and she leaps from the car and jumps off a bridge wearing a Santa Claus costume. Theres even an epilogue in which Harry tells the audience ""Dont worry I saw Lord of the Rings--Im not going to end this 17 times"" but although the movie takes place over the course of four days it seems more like four years. I suppose we all wish Mr. Downey a speedy recovery from his off-screen troubles but Kiss Kiss Bang Bang could send anyone back to rehab. Dont Stay--Go If you dont want to feel alternately frustrated confused bored and exasperated then stay away from Stay. With direction by Marc Forster who made Monsters Ball and Finding Neverland and a cast that includes Ewan McGregor Ryan Gosling and Naomi Watts you might expect more. But this is worse than bad--its unbearable. Completely incomprehensible Stay is filled with shots of swirling circular staircases that go nowhere fuzzy images that might be ghosts and dreamlike hallucinations from at least 20 other stinkers released in the past year. Yet the excessive visual hokum makes no more sense than the plot. Mr. McGregor plays a psychiatrist who meets Mr. Gosling a troubled art student who announces that he will be committing suicide at midnight in a few days. Mr. McGregor discusses this with Ms. Watts his loopy girlfriend who once attempted suicide herself. Then he sets out to talk Mr. Gosling out of his fatal decision. But this outline is only an inch thick. It quickly becomes apparent that this movie is not about anything at all. Sets of people walk by in identical clothing. The same faces show up playing different characters. Time shifts. Actors meld. Then the camera spins around until you will either be forced to walk out or throw up. I opted for the former. How do you care about a movie that is only a mirage? Why do you want to watch actors waffling away their time on a maddening script screwy direction fanciful lighting and cheap tricks? This is the kind of flop that makes even the popcorn taste lousy. Comment Filed under On the Town Trending Now Why Does Selena Gomez Make Half a Million Dollars for Instagram Posts?

By Anthony Lane On the edge of MacArthur Park in Los Angeles a young woman runs across the traffic after dark dressed in a sawn-off Santa suit trimmed with tufts of fur. Her other accessories include festive red panty hose and a loaded gun. Her name is Harmony Faith Lane and if she were one of my relatives I would look forward to Christmas a whole lot more. Sadly she is a fictional being lodged in the world according to Shane Black--a livid pulpish environment where failure to possess a gun is if not a criminal offense at least a crime against style. Black is a man of parts. ""As an actor"" according to Warner Bros. publicists he was ""the first to be eviscerated by the Predator"" which in industry terms means that he once shook hands with Arnold Schwarzenegger. As a screenwriter he was responsible for ""Lethal Weapon"" and may God have mercy on his soul. Now he has directed his own script. ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" stars Robert Downey Jr. as Harry Lockhart a petty thief and better at the pettiness than at the thieving. One charm of this film is that its hero is useless at everything but smoking--not much of a talent given that circumstances have spun him from the East Coast to the West and landed him in L.A. We first see him at a party where he defends the honor of a drunken girl challenges her aggressor and gets his face mashed in. If that strikes you as a wimpish take on the old Philip Marlowe rule--that somebody should make the effort to uphold the dignity of others ones own dignity having been poured down the sink--then youd be right. Harry is a shirker and a shrinker low-grade Bogart cut with shreds of Bob Hope and Black pays homage to Chandler throughout the plot. He chops it into chunks and names each one accordingly. ""Day Two The Lady in the Lake"" or ""Day Three The Little Sister."" The drunken girl is our old friend Harmony (Michelle Monaghan). A while ago she made the trek from Indiana in search of her fortune. Now her sister is in town too but shes dead--in a hotel room naturally hotels being like mass graves in the land of pulp. If you ask me how Harry gets fouled up in this case I couldnt tell you. What roughly occurs is that he flees a crime scene stumbles into a movie audition earns a screen test and finds himself paired with a private dick known as Gay Perry (Val Kilmer) who preps him for the test by teaching him the basics of investigation. All of which takes him back to a crime scene. If youre trying to squeeze this tale for logic forget it. Black is not aiming to make sense. Hes too busy stirring together the juice of a hundred thrillers and cackling like a witch. By rights ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" should be the most annoying movie of the year. It keeps stopping starting and scrolling back. It hops between plot strands like a flea on a dog. At one point the frame of the image freezes halfway up the screen. ""My name is Harry Lockhart and Ill be your narrator"" Harry says adding ""I dont see another goddam narrator so pipe down."" He likes to mock the sweltering absurdities of the plot but then so did Marlowe more than sixty years ago in ""The Lady in the Lake"" ""Ive never liked this scene"" I said. ""Detective confronts murderer. Murderer produces gun points same at detective. Murderer tells detective the whole sad story with the idea of shooting him at the end of it."" Chandler knew in his bones that detective fiction was hardly worth a spoof. How could it be when it lay only inches away from self-parody in the first place? You could be as cocky as you liked but you still had a tale to tell and what links ""The Lady in the Lake"" to ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" is that both put so much time and sweat into smoke-ringed cleverness that they suddenly panic gather themselves and hurry the characters into a final cluster of explanations like a man trying to finish a crossword before his train reaches the station. But heres the joke ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" is not a bust. You may have the occasional unpleasant sensation of having wandered into the Annual General Meeting of Hollywood Smart-asses Incorporated but you come out smiling. The reason is threefold Val Kilmer Michelle Monaghan and Robert Downey Jr. all of them yakking their heads off. As Harmony Monaghan is a real find; she winces at the bum notes of L.A. yet she quips back at Harry as if they were soloists riffing on the same tune. (Their spotting of look-alikes in a fashionable bar--he points out ""the Native American Joe Pesci"" behind her--is a rare delight.) Meanwhile for those of us who liked the funny whippy Kilmer in ""Top Secret"" back in 1984 its a relief to learn that the heavyset sideburned Kilmer can still steal laughs like a pro and the gay patter between him and Downey is both perfect for the fussy disapproving milieu of the private eye and nicely keyed into everything that Chandler often thought but never dared express. ""This isnt good cop and bad cop"" says Harry. ""This is fag and New Yorker."" As for Downey he is the leading protean in American movies. Reports of his offscreen jinks are of interest only insofar as they confirm or feed his life onscreen. Watching a Downey film I look at his eyes as restless as Cary Grants listen to his wired delivery with its hiccups and bass slurs and follow his easy tacking back and forth between sexual tastes and I see not just an invincible dread of boredom--the kind that might well be sated by drugs or by keeping a gun in his truck. I see somebody whose only conceivable home is the movie business. No other star could have assumed the role of Harry because in more secure hands the slippage of his desires not to mention his wild slalom from criminal to crime-buster would have seemed merely silly whereas to a changeling like Downey nothing could be more natural. The fact that Harry becomes an actor without realizing or knowing why or even particularly wanting to be an actor is a delicious comment on Downeys helpless predicament. I wouldnt trust him to look after my handkerchief but Ill watch him in anything and that is why ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang""--smug as it is and more like a day in the reptile house than a night at the movies--remains a slithery treat. To bring a class-action lawsuit against a mining company for sexual harassment is hard enough but you try getting people to see a movie about a class-action lawsuit brought against a mining company for sexual harassment. Such is the challenge that the director Niki Caro has set herself. ""North Country"" stars Charlize Theron as Josey Aimes who walks out of a punch-drunk marriage takes her two children and drives to Minnesota. There she returns to her mother Alice (Sissy Spacek) and her gravelly father Hank (Richard Jenkins) the kind of guy who thinks that a wife with a black eye must somehow be to blame. Hank works at the iron mines nearby. So does Glory (Frances McDormand) an old friend of Joseys who persuades her to follow suit. The job is all grease and grime but it pays well. The problem is that from management down to rockface the miners dont want females on their turf; a fear and loathing of women seems grained into the mens skins like dirt and there is a primitive almost infantile filth-fixation in the way that they vent that scorn daubing fecal graffiti on the womens locker-room walls. Josey hits back which makes her more of a pest than a hero. Not until she airs her grievance in court with the help of Bill White (Woody Harrelson) a local lawyer does she find out who her friends are. There is so much tamping down here so many seams of discontent that the uplifting scenes of the finale seem to have floated in from another film. Theron who is fast becoming the queen of angry victimhood can barely remember how to look pleased. ""North Country"" is beautifully shot by Chris Menges whose credits run from ""Kes"" to ""Dirty Pretty Things"" yet in this case the beauty--light shafting in from the ceiling of the plant heaps of taconite gleaming like gold--is not always helpful tugging against the wish to record a wretched truth. How pretty should dirty things be? As with ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" however you cannot help being stirred by the reach and depth the constant rebuffs to sloppiness of a strong ensemble. Spacek never lets the mothers adherence to good form tighten her into a tyrant or a shrew and when she cracks she cracks quickly and almost noiselessly like a teacup. In the role of Glory McDormand could have turned mushy when she grows sick but she ups her rueful humor instead; as for Sean Bean playing her husband there is no mistaking the relief with which after a resume full of hams and hunks he embraces this unexplosive role. The scene in his downstairs workshop where he delivers a gentle lecture on hatred to Joseys son is the best thing Bean has ever done and he owes Niki Caro a drink. And Michelle Monaghan fresh from ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" gives us the heartbreaking Sherry a fellow-sufferer alongside Josey barely grown up but already ground down. Its a long way from Harmony Faith Lane.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993. More Read something that means something Try The New Yorker for only a dollar a week.

Running time 102 minutes. Rated R (profanity violence sex nudity). At the Empire the Lincoln Square the Loews Village others. SCREENWRITER Shane Black is back with a vengeance as the director of ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" a smart hilarious and affec tionate spoof of detective movies - and Hollywood - starring the inspired team of Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer. Black who became Tinseltowns top-paid screenwriter in his early 20s after creating the ""Lethal Weapon"" franchise - only to disappear a decade ago after a couple of flops - knows where the bodies are buried in more ways than one. Downey plays Harry a small-time crook who accidentally auditions for a movie while fleeing a crime scene in Manhattan and of course lands the part. At the first of a series of wild Hollywood Christmas parties Harry meets a character nicknamed Gay Perry (Val Kilmer) a tough private eye assigned to become his acting coach. Harry also meets Harmony (Michelle Monaghan) a former childhood friend and pulp-fiction aficionado who believes that Harry actually is a P.I. - and asks him to investigate a mystery involving her sister. But by this point Harry has gotten himself and a very annoyed Perry involved in another seemingly unrelated case. The comically convoluted plot - which makes ""The Big Sleep"" seem almost comprehensible - involves a series of female corpses (one of whom Harry accidentally urinates on when he discovers it in his bathroom) mistaken identities shootouts double-crosses beatingsand incest among other genre staples. Much of the fun comes from the constant bickering between the inept Harry and the extremely professional Perry who uses his sexuality in constantly surprising ways. ""This isnt good cop bad cop"" he explains to one bad guy. ""This is fag and New Yorker."" Downey who also serves as an extremely unreliable narrator is at his most endearing as the bumbling Harry. And Kilmer in his first full-scale comic role since ""Top Secret"" more than two decades ago is an absolute hoot as the exasperated Perry. ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" takes its title from a collection of reviews by Pauline Kael part of its story from a 1941 Brett Halliday novel and borrows chapter headings from Raymond Chandler. Black honors all of them with one of the seasons most delightful surprises.

Liam Lacey From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 21 2005 1200AM EDT Last updated Tuesday Mar. 17 2009 540PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Kiss Kiss Bang Bang Reviewed by Liam Lacey  Directed and written by Shane Black Starring Robert Downey Jr. Val Kilmer and Michelle Monaghan Classification 14A When a movie sets out so self-consciously to be a disreputable pleasure you feel wrong for falling for it but not to quote one of the innumerable quotable phrases from the script of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang ""every shade of wrong."" The movie is pretty damned funny in its insubstantial gratuitously violent gratuitously everything way. Insulting everything from The Lord of the Rings to Drew Barrymore arbitrarily using Raymond Chandler book titles for its chapter headings throwing in flashbacks digressions and voiceover intrusions the entire movie feels like a big inside ha-ha. I confess I ha-had and more than once. The title comes from James Bond ( Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang was the original Shirley Bassey-sung title song for the movie Thunderball) as well as the name of a book of film reviews by Pauline Kael. The opening-credit cartoon sequence is an homage to Saul Bass. The plot takes its inspiration from the pulpy Mike Shane novels by Brett Halliday books notable for their illustrated covers of half-dressed bad girls in improbable poses. The maestro of all this ingenious larceny is Shane Black the one-time screenwriting wunderkind of Hollywood who created the Lethal Weapon franchise when he was just 22. He subsequently wrote The Last Action Hero The Last Boy Scout and The Long Kiss Goodnight before going into seclusion in the late nineties reportedly bored and contemptuous of the action-movie business. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is his first movie as a director and although its a departure fans will see connections The wise-cracking black humour that made the first Lethal Weapon seem fresh and more specific preoccupations such as kidnapping Christmas and torture. This time the entire package comes in prominent ironic quote marks. Lets see how it goes Robert Downey Jr. plays petty thief Harry Lockhart who we first meet boosting X-Boxes at a New York electronics store. When the police arrive he runs up a staircase into an audition for a movie about a detective. He happens to get the part is flown to Los Angeles for a screen test where hes supposed to prepare for his role by hanging out with a detective called Perry Von Shrike known by his employer as Gay Perry -- say it with a French accent -- who is in fact gay and is played by Val Kilmer. When old flame and wannabe actress Harmony Faith (Michelle Monaghan) needs Harrys help he pretends he really is a detective and soon its raining dead girls though some of them may be duplicates or just corpses that move around a lot. Keeping this improbable plot almost credible depends mightily on the charm of the hyper-energetic self-deprecating and irreverent persona of Robert Downey Jr. (Other stars considered for the role reportedly included Harrison Ford and Johnny Knoxville. Huh?) In its final Downey-ized form the movie is self-referential enough to mock the stars own storied screw-ups At one point his character awakens in a suburban garage at night and wanders into the adjacent home. The one-liners come fast and rude and when it turns into an action movie in the last 20 minutes Black throws in enough comically improbable scenarios to cause Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzenegger to salivate. Otherwise the casting is a little less persuasive. Val Kilmer as a GQ-dressing tough guy is a standing gay joke that wears awfully thin. Michelle Monaghan who supposedly was the high-school crush of Downeys character looks a good 15 years too young for the role which is only explicable if its another in-joke on the Hollywood cosmetics industry. The movie is intended as Shane Blacks resurrection but it stands out more prominently as another comeback in the eccentric and fascinating career of Robert Downey Jr. who once again raises the level of a movie by his performance.

"Private-eye farce is the best party in town - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Private-eye farce is the best party in town By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  October 21 2005 The story goes that when screenwriter Shane Black was coming up in Hollywood 15 years ago he and his housemates used to throw bashes that regularly devolved into precise re-creations of classic fight scenes from Hong Kong action movies on their front lawn. His directorial debut Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" takes a similar approach to the hard-boiled detective genre Its a merry deconstructive delight and easily the best party in town.Its also a surprisingly confident comeback for Black -- the kid who made millions penning boom-boom buddy films like Lethal Weapon"" in the late 1980s -- and a blazing return to form for both Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" is such a good time that you may not care if its less than the sum of its fabulously witty parts.Downeys drug and legal problems are in the past but theyve somehow added to his bitter comic authority. Playing petty thief-turned-Hollywood-actor-turned-wannabe-detective Harry Lockhart Downey narrates his way through the byzantine plot like a man spinning tall tales occasionally stopping to point out their absurdity. Several times the film appears to jam in the projector gate while Harry berates himself for missing a key bit of information.A little of this meta-movie archness goes a long way unless youre an expert juggler and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" is lucky to have a number on board. Lured to LA by a shady producer (Larry Miller) promising him a part Harry is instructed to stick by the side of private eye Perry Van Shrike a.k.a. Gay Perry (Kilmer) who dresses in discreetly expensive suits and informs him that real PI work is boring. This is just before a car with a dead woman in its trunk sails over their heads.There are many more corpses before the film ends but they seem to pile up almost accidentally and to Harrys great chagrin. (The one that appears in his hotel bathroom is greeted with an involuntary physical response thats both understandable and really sick.) All he wants to do is get close to Harmony Lane (Michelle Monaghan) the childhood sweetheart who has reappeared almost magically as a struggling actress in Gay Perrys orbit. Despite her protests -- and Monaghan doth protest with sly and sensuous charm -- she and Harry are made for each other.Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" is full of mordantly delicious inside-Hollywood shots When a woman at a party tells Harry I do a little acting"" the film cuts to her scene getting decapitated in a Z-grade horror film. Theres even a riff on the pharmaceutically fueled home invasion that was Downeys real-life nadir a few years back; the movie suggests this is a normal stage for actors on the slide. Blacks equally in love with the tough-guy patter of private eye fiction but he gives it a playfully shallow spin that lives on the lips of actors and dies on the printed page (meaning its useless to quote here).Downey ricochets through Kiss Kiss"" with aplomb but Val Kilmer owns the movie as a man who approaches his sexuality with the same dryly rattled professionalism as he approaches his caseload. Gay Perry doesnt really want Harry around -- Sleep badly; any questions hesitate to call"" he instructs his partner by way of saying good night -- but he knows a good mystery when someone else bumbles into it. Kilmers timing here elevates Blacks bad-boy dialogue close to the realm of farce and for those who remember the actors 80s comedies like Real Genius"" this is a long-awaited homecoming. (For those who know only the unintentional hilarity of Alexander"" and The Island of Dr. Moreau"" Kilmer will be a revelation.)Much of the fun in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" lies in the piling of event upon surreal event and while Im still not sure how that large friendly dog got in there its scene is perhaps the movies black-comedy highpoint. There are shady women in pink wigs gunmen trying to banter Tarantino-style and failing an unwanted minor amputation and bullets that never land where theyre meant to.After a while though the seams holding the whole thing together start to come apart and in the spaces between you see -- nothing. More antic than Get Shorty"" and less brutally artful than Pulp Fiction"" Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" lacks the lasting impact of either movie and it continually tiptoes on the edge of smarm. The central mystery is sacrificed to individual scenes; the self-conscious style ultimately nullifies its content. When Elvis makes a brief appearance toward the end you realize Blacks willing to throw just about anything into his stewpot. He has fashioned a dazzling bagatelle that spins faster and faster until it disappears and while the movie puts him back in the ring theres only so much pride you can take in glibness.Maybe thats asking too much. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" is a terrific one-night stand but you may wake up as Harry does and wonder exactly who you slept with. Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Robert Downey Jr. right pretends to be actor who has to learn to be a detective from Val Kilmer in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. Warner Bros. Pictures The rest though is undermined by inconvenient rules that state what a detective story must have a mystery. So were left with a form-fitting role for Robert Downey Jr.s tics; a Val Kilmer performance thats ""the anti-Jim Morrison""; and relative newcomer Michelle Monaghans fresh spin on the film noir vixen a sexy tomboy type. And how does Downeys character pull off his career switch in this directorial debut of Lethal Weapon writer Shane Black? Well hes chased by the cops and stumbles into a New York acting audition landing a detective role. Hes then assigned to learn the ropes by hanging out with a real sleuth a gay gumshoe (Kilmer). About the movie Kiss Kiss Bang Bang  1/2 (out of four) Stars Robert Downey Jr. Val Kilmer Michelle Monaghan Corbin Bernsen Larry Miller Director Shane Black Distributor Warner Bros. Rating R for language violence and sexuality/nudity Running time 1 hour 42 minutes Opens Friday in select cities Monaghan is the woman from back home in Indiana -- the gal-pal Downey lusted for futilely in high school. He initially fails to recognize her then undergoes a major mind-melt once he does. At this point dead bodies become a distraction from the initial breeziness as Kiss all but outdoes The Big Sleep for storytelling obfuscation. All three actors give it their all but Monaghan stands out with a sexy yet oddly down-to-earth variation on the Midwest girl gone wrong thanks partly to a dark dysfunctional family secret. Atop A History of Violence also set in Indiana Hollywood has really put the horror in Hoosier this past month.

"Raymond Chandler lite - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMovies | REVIEW Raymond Chandler liteShane Blacks Kiss Kiss Bang Bang delivers some goofy fun but the wacky voice-overs like so much else proves wearying.October 21 2005|Kenneth Turan | Times Staff Writer Given that ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" is Shane Blacks directorial debut after nearly 20 years as a screenwriter its not surprising that the film has the exuberant glee of a kid whos just been let out of detention. A little of this kind of glee however goes a longer way than you might expect.Black the screenwriter best known for dreaming up the ""Lethal Weapon"" franchise is someone who cant resist showing off and that eventually becomes a problem. Its not that hes not stylish and inventive -- he is. But ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" turns into a film that is too ostentatiously pleased with itself so in love with its own cleverness it doesnt notice its darn near worn you out.A post-post-modern version of the Los Angeles-based hard-boiled detective story starring the yin and yang team of verbose Robert Downey Jr. and laconic Val Kilmer ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" is first of all filled with popular culture references almost without end.Its title for instance is identical to one critic Pauline Kael cribbed from an Italian poster for an early review collection because it was ""perhaps the briefest statement imaginable of the basic appeal of movies."" The titles of Raymond Chandler novels and short story collections -- ""The Lady in the Lake"" ""The Little Sister"" ""Trouble Is My Business"" -- are used as visual chapter titles here. Black even names a peripheral character Flicka so someone can refer to ""my friend Flicka"" and remind us of that barely remembered 1950s TV show.Just as glib as Black is his protagonist/alter ego Harry Lockhart (Downey at his most engagingly voluble). Introduced at the kind of L.A. party where ""if a girls name is Jill she spells it Jyll"" Harry is our guide through the wilder shores of Hollywood.Its not we soon learn his native habitat. A complete fluke too amusing to give away has brought this New Yorker to the coast where a producer is grooming him for a role as a detective. Part of the process has Harry apprentice himself to a real-life detective named Perry van Shrike (Kilmer) nicknamed ""Gay Perry"" because of his sexual orientation and because Black couldnt resist the sound of the name.A no-nonsense type (and one of Kilmers most effective performances) whose motto is ""any questions hesitate to call"" Perry insists to Harry that detective work is boring in real life. What happens to this unlikely team when they hook up with Harrys dream girl Harmony Faith Lane (a lively Michelle Monaghan) is anything but.For ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" has one of those hyper-complex plots filled with feints and dodges corpses and coincidences that is so self-referentially twisted that Harry feels free to use his voice-over to taunt the audience with a brazen ""Have you solved this yet?""Harrys voice-over work as he is the first to point out adds to the confusion. Hes forever forgetting to pass on information stopping the film to confess ""I was a bad narrator"" and then calling our bluff with a terse ""I dont see another narrator so pipe down.""This kind of show-offy slickness is entertaining for a while as is Harrys habit of saying things like ""I was wetter than Drew Barrymore at a grunge club."" But 103 minutes of nonstop glossy patter proves wearing. When Harmony Faith Lane takes a deep breath and says ""this is so exhausting"" she speaks for more people than she realizes.Kiss Kiss Bang BangMPAA rating R for language violence and sexuality/nudityTimes guidelines More violence than you might be expectingReleased by Warner Bros.

With Val Kilmer Robert Downey Jr. (102 min.) Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? As a petty thief turned aspiring actor and detective in Shane Blacks raucously entertaining ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" Robert Downey Jr. is on screen almost all the time which is good news since few performers can hold the screen as well. His live-wire physicality is capable of just about anything. In his new film he uses it for comic effect; at times he is as jumpy and jerky as a cartoon character (Bugs Bunny to be exact). Black who wrote ""Lethal Weapon"" makes his directorial debut and he puts a fresh spin not only on that film but also on a whole slew of films noirs. Grade B+- Peter Rainer Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Stay (R)Director Marc Forster. With Ewan McGregor Naomi Watts. (99 min.)If youre the kind of moviegoer who likes puzzling out the plots of insoluble movies then by all means rush to see ""Stay"" a great big blurry mess starring Ewan McGregor as a psychiatrist who gets pulled into the dreamscape of his disturbed patient played by Ryan Gosling. Besides these two Naomi Watts and Bob Hoskins also make appearances - the cast if not the movie is first-rate. The director Marc Foster most recently made ""Finding Neverland"" which could also serve as the title for his new film except nothing is found and ""neverland"" is too kind a term for the chaos he flings at us.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet In the years after Scream it quickly became apparent that films acknowledging the tricks and cliches of genre filmmaking could be just as dull as those which pretended not to notice them. The winking just made what was tired before seem meta-tired. What the Scream rip-offs (and eventually the Scream series itself) forgot was that all the peeks behind the curtain didnt matter if the viewers didnt care what was in front of the curtain. Old-fashioned virtues like intriguing characters a compelling plot and exciting filmmaking dont hurt either. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang has one foot in Screams deconstruct-as-we-go-along approach but its just one element kicking around the audacious sure-footed directorial debut of screenwriter Shane Black. In the early 90s Black was the highest-paid writer in Hollywood thanks to Lethal Weapon and The Last Boy Scout. But Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is only Blacks second produced screenplay since 1996s The Long Kiss Goodnight. (It follows 1999s virtually unseen A.W.O.L.) That might explain why hes made a film about second chances filled with a cast in need of them specifically Robert Downey Jr. Val Kilmer and in a supporting role Corbin Bernsen. Together theyre the hottest lineup of 1991. So it makes sense that an impatience with Los Angeles moviemaking and genre films fuels Kiss Kiss Bang Bang a noir-inspired L.A. mystery that isnt afraid to show some satirical teeth. It opens however on the other coast with Downey stumbling from a botched robbery into a screen test that takes him to Hollywood. There he begins researching a role with gay private eye Val Kilmer and he hooks up with a lost high-school love (Michelle Monaghan) whose chance encounter with a strung-out actor (nice touch that) who stumbles into her house one night might be her last shot for finding fame beyond work in beer commercials. Theres a mystery of course inspired by an entry in Brett Hallidays extensive series of Michael Shayne novels. When the film sinks into the storys mechanics it loses some of the crazy energy that drives its first few reels but when the momentum of play between fiction and reality--and how the illusions of one influence the other--dont carry it the acidic dialogue and winning characters do. Playing a man who has to learn to stop acting like a tough guy and be one Downey sinks into the meaty role and Kilmers clipped delivery creates a character as hardboiled in his own way as the heroes of the Raymond Chandler novels that give Kiss Kiss Bang Bang its chapter titles. If only he didnt seem more asexual than gay Kilmer might have been a giant step forward for gay action heroes instead of just the first one of any significance. Blacks sadistic streak remains as uncomfortable as it ever was and his direction is very much in the house style of producer Joel Silver. But both elements perfectly suit the material which sneaks in a lot of sly stuff beneath the slick surface. The movie itself may be the slyest bit of all proving that its possible to come back not just adequately but better than before.

"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; kiss-kiss-bang-bang ) Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is the breezy directorial debut of Lethal Weapon screenwriter Shane Black. Black knows film noir inside and out because he uses the basic template here. He jazzes things up by employing an aware and self-deprecating narrator and toying with many of the clichA(c)s. Yet although the tone is never more than semi-serious and Blacks tongue is never far from his cheek we grow to like the characters. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang offers a few thrills a surprise or two and several wholehearted laughs. It gives off the same kind of vibe as Get Shorty. The film is narrated by Robert Downey Jr.s Harry Lockhart and he makes it apparent from the start that hes not a generic disembodied voice. He knows hes talking to a movie audience and he doesnt hesitate to pause or rewind the film when he forgets something or makes a mistake. At one point he comments ""This is bad narrating"" then wonders if its okay for him to use a certain profanity. From time-to-time Hollywood uses offbeat narration but the last time I recall something this irreverent was when Christina Ricci provided the voiceover for The Opposite of Sex. Harry is a petty thief in New York City who breaks into a casting call in an attempt to escape the police and ends up being invited to Los Angeles as the ""next big discovery"" of a hot-shot producer (Larry Miller). Once there he is teamed with a private investigator named ""Gay Perry"" (Val Kilmer) who is supposed to teach him how to become a better actor by exposing him to real-life detective situations. Harry gets more than he bargained for. On the good side he is reunited with his high school sweetheart an actress wannabe named Harmony (Michelle Monaghan). On the bad side he discovers two bodies in less than 24 hours - one of which resurfaces (after being disposed of) in his hotel room bathroom. Someone thinks Harry knows something he shouldnt and he/she is determined to shut him up. The noir plot is standard. Black knows it. We know it. And Black knows that we know it. So he spices things up by including all of the expected contrivances but never buying into them wholeheartedly. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang has fun with the conventions of the genre by simultaneously embracing them and mocking them. Despite all of the laughs however its not a full-fledged parody. Then again considering how close many noir B-movies come to self-parody it can be difficult to identify the line of demarcation. Robert Downey Jr. is perfect as Harry. He brings the right mix of cynicism self-doubt and unpretentiousness. He has the timing of a comedian and the ability to summon a dramatic approach to the films (few) more serious moments. Val Kilmer adds a degree of pomposity to his part as the elusive grammatically particular Gay Perry. And Michelle Monaghan makes for an atypical femme fatale. Shes too straightforward and in-your-face to hide many secrets. Instead of slinky black dresses she favors female Santa costumes and its almost worth the price of admission to see her in (and out of) them. Has-been Corbin Bernsen plays an appropriate role - that of a washed-up actor who has moved on to other business endeavors. Blacks screenplay doesnt insult the audiences intelligence by slowing down to let the confused viewer catch up. At times the plot careens forward so quickly it seems like a scene is missing. But the rapid-fire pace is useful because it keeps us involved. And despite its irreverent tone the narration avoids becoming a distraction. Significant chunks of time go by without Harrys omnipresent voice offering comments or observations. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang doesnt offer much thats groundbreaking but it gets the balance between comedy and pulp thrillers right and the result is an entertaining albeit eclectic and eccentric mA(c)lange.

""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" is a stylish smarty-pants mystery thriller from the way-glib pen of Shane Black. In his directorial debut Black has made a film at the adrenaline level of the manic cop character he wrote for Mel Gibson in ""Lethal Weapon"" and the Hollywood setting provides an excuse for a wise-ass insider tone. Perhaps too clever for its own good and so confusingly dense one is tempted to stop trying to follow the plot and just go along for the ride Warner Bros. release looks poised for a modest theatrical life with likely prolonged cult status among hardcore fans in home formats. Taking its title from James Bond and Pauline Kael hyperventilating pic has the perfect put-upon lead in Robert Downey Jr. as a no-account New York actor whose ad hoc pose as a private dick on a trip to Los Angeles leads him into very deep and murky water. First seen as an outsider at a chic Hollywood Hills party Downeys Harry Lockhart explains in playfully confidential narration how he ended up here at the behest of Gay Perry an upfront and funny character played in what can modestly be termed an extreme change of pace by Val Kilmer; jokey gay banter abounds which may amuse and bewilder different viewers in equal measure. Harry also expounds on his forlorn history with a long-lost high-school heartthrob who reportedly got it on with nearly every boy in his small-town Indiana class except for him. So who should catch his eye at the party but a slinky lady who turns out to be the very same woman Harmony (Michelle Monaghan) now a pulp-fiction aficionado whose sassy rap recaptures Harrys fancy. In the first of several hilarious/awful mishaps that prevent him from finally scoring with her Harry manages to take Harmony and her plain Jane girlfriend home only to get so wasted he sleeps with the wrong woman. As nicely set up as it is however the Harry/Harmony reunion presents a major problem simply because Downey looks about 15 years older than Monaghan with both characters briefly repped by child actors of the same age; the issue continues to dog the film throughout. Party and club talk is so deft and mordant you get the feeling Black could write it all night and nobody could deliver it better than Downey with a deadpan sometime sad-sack tone that contains a delicious mix of self-deprecation and bad-boy impudence. But not content to toss off one-upping dialogue at a dizzying clip Black must finally get around to laying out a plot and here things get quickly tangled. While waiting for what he hopes will be a career-altering movie role Harry gets into the sleuthing business. Its all far too complicated to explain even if you could; Gay Perry gives it a go at the very end and only affirms the inscrutability of the yarn in the process. But it involves Harrys discovery of a succession of female corpses the identities of which are jumbled; Harmony egging him on to solve the mysteries because shes convinced hes a detective; Harry and Perry bickering while they help each other out of jams; Harry becoming detached from the same finger twice; significant humor stemming from the location where Perry carries a secret Derringer; a reasonably outrageous action climax set on a freeway overpass; and an epilogue cut short as Harry reassures ""Dont worry I saw Lord of the Rings. Im not going to end this 17 times."" To no particular point other than paying homage where homage is due pic is divided into five chapters named after Raymond Chandler titles beginning with ""Trouble Is My Business"" and concluding with ""Farewell My Lovely."" Once again making a diverting but insubstantial movie look better than it is Downey with haggard charm to burn is winning all the way. Kilmer is riotous at times as an impeccably groomed businesslike guy keen to assert his orientation at every opportunity. Monaghan handles the cascading dialogue with aplomb but cant eradicate the sense of mismatch with Downey. Visual style is enjoyably nimble and slick and musical choices are smart.
