Comments Spider-Man 2 Recommended Many critics are calling this an improvement over the first movie and theyre probably right. But both are fairly routine minor variations on superhero tropes that have been around for over half a century and as such I find them blending together into one ultimately forgettable (if agreeable) four-hour romp. As Dr. Octopus Alfred Molina makes a more baroque supervillain than Willem Dafoes Green Goblin but the other stars--Tobey Maguire Kirsten Dunst James Franco Rosemary Harris J.K. Simmons--seem happy to be giving us more of the same. Sam Raimis direction on the other hand is even more fluent and well paced integrating the heros spectacular acrobatics with the grueling horrors of being a working-class teen. PG-13 127 min.

"At the Movies Spider-Man 2 062904 - The Augusta Chronicle Augusta Chronicle   | CC News Times   | Augusta.com   | Augusta Real Estate   | Augusta Autos   | Augusta Jobs   | Apartment Finder Site Web At the Movies Spider-Man 2 By Christy Lemire| Associated Press Tuesday June 29 2004 More is more - and were not talking about Michael Moore for once - with ""Spider-Man 2."" The web-slinging sequences are bigger-better-brighter-faster than the already spectacular ones in 2002s ""Spider-Man"" and at the same time the films smaller emotional moments are denser richer and more resonant than those in the first. Summer blockbusters arent supposed to make you think or feel - they usually dazzle and deafen for a couple of hours of air-conditioned numbness before sending you back out into the blinding sun. Much of what makes the ""Spider-Man"" movies more engaging has to do with Tobey Maguire whose big blue eyes and boyish face ooze vulnerability - when hes not wearing the Spidey mask that is. You want to take him in your arms and protect him from the worlds cruelties even though as a comic-book superhero its his responsibility to protect everyone else. When hes just regular-guy Peter Parker hes even more of a sad sack than he was in the first film. Director Sam Raimi needed time with ""Spider-Man"" to establish Peters back story and the thrill of discovering his new powers. With the sequel - written by Alvin Sargent from a story by Michael Chabon Alfred Gough and Miles Millar - Raimi has room to explore the details of Peters daily life which can be simultaneously hilarious and heartbreaking. Hes always late - with the rent on his shabby one-room apartment; with his job delivering pizzas which he loses at the films beginning; and with assignments for his college science courses where his professors have written him off as brilliant but lazy. Hes wracked with guilt over the death of his uncle Ben for which he feels responsible. He tries but fails to financially support his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) whos on the verge of eviction. And he constantly disappoints best friend Harry (James Franco) and secret love Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) when his secret life takes him away from them. Peter Parker in essence is just like us - struggling to keep it together while juggling a million tasks at once. Some of those tasks just happen to include stopping crimes and saving lives. That becomes more difficult when Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) a scientist Peter admires turns into the menacing multitentacled Doc Ock during a fusion experiment that goes horribly awry. Doc Ock is a more intimidating villain than Willem Dafoes Green Goblin was in the original film partly because his face isnt obscured by a dark mask and partly because his capacity for destruction is so much greater. He first unleashes his fury in a truly horrifying scene in a hospital operating room that harkens to Raimis ""Evil Dead"" days in the 80s. The four metal arms that snake and whip from his back have minds of their own and they often want to wreak havoc on Manhattan when the human being theyre attached to wants to do the right thing. And yet because Doc Ock is such a complicated creature trying to figure out exactly how hes doing what hes doing can be distracting and it sometimes takes away from the action itself. (Molina however has no trouble conveying warmth and humanity as his character fights his newfound evil urges.) At its core though ""Spider-Man 2"" is a love story fully realized and with a believable effortless chemistry between Maguire and an adorably redheaded Dunst. The most moving moments take place when Peter and Mary Jane are on the verge of professing their hidden ardor for each other - or at least sharing their first face-to-face kiss having famously smooched in the rain in part one while Peter was upside-down disguised in his red-and-blue get-up. Stricken with doubt Peter even temporarily abdicates his Spideyship to be with Mary Jane until crime and chaos ensue - to the delight of Daily Bugle tabloid editor J. Jonah Jameson played again with campy cigar-chomping glee by J.K. Simmons. Something always stands between them though - like Mary Janes fiance or a car that comes flying at her and Peter through a coffee house window. And who in the audience cant relate to that? ""Spider-Man 2"" a Columbia Pictures release is rated PG-13 for stylized action violence. Running time 122 minutes. Three stars out of four.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The 2002 box-office smash Spider-Man didnt just warrant a sequel; it demanded one. Sam Raimis superhero epic was a textbook example of how to bring a beloved comic book to the big screen with its spirit intact just as its terrific follow-up illustrates how a sequel can build and expand on its predecessor rather than simply cannibalizing it. Simultaneously funnier darker and more emotional than its forebear Spider-Man 2 opens with its web-slinging protagonist (Tobey Maguire deftly balancing action and angst) at a low ebb. Tired of his indecisiveness his would-be girlfriend Kirsten Dunst has moved on to a less conflicted suitor. Maguires gig as a freelance photographer is constantly in danger while professor Dylan Baker views him as brilliant but lazy little realizing that Maguires extracurricular activities involve more than the usual bong-huffing and channel-surfing. Cracking under the strain of his thankless job rescuing a regularly imperiled New York that still views him with suspicion and dismayed by a sudden reduction in his web-slinging abilities Maguire decides to retire his Spider-Man ensemble and pursue the simple pleasures that come with not having to save the world. His resolve is tested however when Alfred Molina dramatically transforms from an endearingly dorky scientist to super-villain Dr. Octopus a malevolent David Cronenberg-esque fusion of man and machine with sinister mechanical arms that have an evil will all their own. Raimi and his screenwriters--including two-time Academy Award winner Alvin Sargent and novelist Michael Chabon--use their characters superhuman powers to amplify the issues and concerns of a human story. Spider-Man 2 wrestles with conflicts between power and responsibility but the filmmakers smartly counter heavy drama with goofy comedy mining a rich vein of humor in the juxtaposition of the mundane and the superheroic. Maguire and Molina excel at opposite ends of the moral spectrum but the film is stolen once again by J.K. Simmons as Maguires belligerent relentlessly self-serving motormouth of a boss whose office is a loving oasis of retro screwball comedy anachronistic hairstyles and all. Molinas tormented man-machine is a stunning technical and creative achievement a terrifying monster who moves with the sinister shudder of an impending earthquake and fights a mostly losing battle with his own mind and body. His weirdly expressive mechanical arms alone have more personality than most human movie characters but Molinas performance ensures that the man doesnt get lost in the machinery. In that sense hes a bit like Spider-Man 2 itself a blockbuster with tremendous emotional resonance a special-effects extravaganza with soul.

Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) hits a mid-career existential crisis in this superior follow-up to the original and the result is all the more interesting for it. Sure Spidie still emits goo from his wrists and swings through the streets in pursuit of comic book criminals (theres no terrorist threat in this New York City) but he does so with a heavy heart. Superman was always most intriguing when he was battling his own powers - cowering at the sight of Kryptonite or drunkenly flicking peanuts at bartenders in Superman 3. Now poor old Parker joins the line-up of good guys having a crisis. Hes fed up and depressed. Hell he doesnt even know if he wants to be a crimefighter anymore goddammit Welcome to twenty-first-century America; where even superheroes need a shrink.The problem? Sweet old Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is still on the scene tempting Parker to renege on his earlier commitment to duty over domesticity. But theres trouble brewing in the world of science maverick nuclear physicist Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) accidentally turns himself into an eight-limbed metallic creature who looks pretty nifty in a black leather coat and sunglasses. Molina makes a great bad guy; less of a caricature than Willem Dafoes Green Goblin and more menacing as a result of scrimping on the camp histrionics.Its not all neuroses and nuclear science. Two centrepiece showdowns between Octavius (or Doc Ock as the Daily Bugle tags him) and Spider-Man - the first on a speeding subway train the second on a derelict pier - make for excellent gripping viewing. All in all this sequel is a blockbuster with both a heart and a brain. And Raimi leaves the door wide open for the next hopefully welcome instalment.

By Anthony Lane Our first duty with regard to ""Spider-Man 2"" is to congratulate the filmmakers on their refusal to elasticate the title. I am fed up with having to wrap my tongue around ""Pirates of the Caribbean The Curse of the Black Pearl"" and as for the forthcoming ""Anacondas The Hunt for the Blood Orchid"" why bother to see a picture whose name goes on even longer than its leading snake? There would have been little percentage in luring us with ""Spider-Man 2 Back Up Through the Plughole"" or ""Spider-Man 2 Still Not Quite Sure What to Do with All His Sticky Stuff."" We know the deal. This second film--written by Alvin Sargent and directed once again by Sam Raimi--is like the first installment refreshingly perverse in its intent. It is an action movie founded on indecision. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) continues to be blessed with an armory of web-based gifts which enable him to wreak a twanging revenge on the criminal element of New York and to widen the eyes of Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) in the process yet part of Peter craves the quiet life. In the first half of the movie he merrily swings by during a police pursuit strings up the villains and stops a car from landing on the heads of crushable citizens; in the second half he spies an alleyway mugging pauses then walks away. There is only one young man I can think of who was more torn about his purpose in life and he regrettably was taken off the case by Laertes. One reason that superhero franchises are now so rampant in Hollywood is that more often than not they lend thrust to the revenge of the nerd. All the reported haggling over who would play Spider-Man--Maguire Jake Gyllenhaal you name it--was basically a means of fending off the awful truth that the person most suited to the role was never going to be available because he was too busy running Microsoft. The moment at which Michael Keatons Bruce Wayne a twitching social misfit decided to shoehorn himself into black rubber for ""Batman"" back in 1989 we realized that the world would no longer be saved by tough guys but by dreamy fetishistic types who donned their mock toughness as a form of extreme therapy. That is why George Clooneys Batman came off worst of all; Clooney is the one current American star who hails from the constellation of true leading men and so when he does appear we like him straight up not hiding his light beneath a hood. Maguires Spider-Man on the other hand spends most of the time wringing his adhesive hands over the doubleness of his nature and Raimi takes care to insert innumerable gags at the expense of Parkers geekhood--taking a tumble in the street or grabbing for and missing the canapes at a swish soiree where Mary Jane understandably miffed at his vacillations gets engaged to another man. And not just any man but an astronaut. Every movie franchise demands a regular turnover of nemeses and ""Spider-Man 2"" does not disappoint. In fact it performs better than its predecessor for in place of the wildly cackling and therefore deeply unfrightening Green Goblin we have Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) known to the tabloids as Doc Ock. Molina is such a singular presence fleshy pendulous and sad like a secret love child of Charles Laughton. Otto a pensive scientist with a poetry-reading wife seems only mildly put out when one of his experiments backfires leaving him with four metal limbs that appear to have plans and perhaps even voting intentions very different from his own. They writhe and snap like Medusas hair they enable Otto to scale buildings and they light his cigar; what services they provide in the privacy of his bathroom I shudder to think. They even walk the walk for him clattering along like the claws of a crab and Molina seems to relish the ride with an unflustered serenity. Amid all this we get a dull subplot about Harry Osborn (James Franco) the scion of the Green Goblin who keeps tearfully vowing to avenge his fathers death but we know what we want here we want Spider-Man to join battle with Doc Ock and in so doing to wreck as much real estate as possible. Hence the climactic feud which takes place on an elevated train of the movies own devising; the real New York has been overlaid with a comic-book brightness although Raimi insures that the subway carful of New Yorkers who offer help to Spider-Man are reassuringly ordinary in their heroism and in their own deep need for reassurance. So vigorous is the fight that Spider-Man is unmasked and the passengers find themselves looking at the non-super face of Peter Parker ""Hes just a kid"" one of them says. By the end of the film Mary Jane too sees our hero hoodless but she registers little surprise. ""I think I always knew"" she says and if theres one actress to whom producers turn for lack of faze its Kirsten Dunst. She looks no happier about the hue of her hair which could be the pelt of a highly embarrassed fox than she did in the previous picture but there is wonderful consolation in the near-narcoleptic calm of her gaze. The typical Dunst reverie in which the body is all there but the mind is elsewhere makes her the least modern of actresses; look at stills of Marion Davies or other stalwarts of the silent era and you catch the same strain of inward rhapsody. (Mary Jane is even tied up and imperilled toward the end like an early heroine lashed to a railroad track.) Thus perhaps the unexpected--even unplanned--strangeness of Raimis film which fulfills its brief as a summer smash but which also proceeds with a distracted and sometimes lonely air. Never has a blockbuster I would guess required so many soliloquies. What with the mournful Molina the hazed-over Dunst and the puffy uncertainties of Maguire we in the audience are the only ones who still believe without qualification in thrill and spill. Consider the moment at which Peters lips draw close to Mary Janes opening slightly for a kiss only to be interrupted by a large automobile being tossed through the window behind them. Dont you just love it when that happens? The closeups at the start of ""The Clearing"" are too close for comfort. Arnold Mack (Willem Dafoe) is getting up and preparing for work but the way the camera treats him inspecting everything from the lather on his chin to the part in his hair suggests somebody who is destined for a physical or a police lineup. As things turn out this hint of unhealthiness whether of body or of soul is well founded for Arnold is about to embark on a days intensive kidnapping. Later we realize that he has even made a couple of packed lunches with a choice of ham or tuna for his victim. The victim is Wayne Hayes (Robert Redford) and I hope Im not alone in feeling a twinge of cosmic sadness at the thought that Robert Redford who once flashed the most winning smile in the world has been reduced to playing somebody named Wayne Hayes. Still if Wayne represents the clouding over of the Sundance Kid he doesnt show it; he lives in a sylvan suburb with a pool a dog a maid and a car so fancy that its side mirrors open and close like the petals of a remote-controlled rose. Its a fitting gimmick since Wayne made his pile in the car-rental business--hes ""the man Hertz and Avis are afraid of"" in the words of the awestruck Arnold. The problem with Arnold is that nobody is afraid of him. He was laid off long ago in the wake of Waynes success but now in his mild and sweaty fashion he is bent on vengeance. With his fussy planning and his fake mustache Arnold is a throwback to the old-fashioned desperation of the little man an Arthur Miller character doing a David Mamet thing. The film soon settles into a two-tone plot dividing its time between a tranquil forest through which Arnold guides Wayne with a gun and the Hayes family home. There Eileen Hayes (Helen Mirren) holds court awaiting her husbands return and condescending exquisitely to the F.B.I. officials who are handling the crime. One of them Agent Fuller (Matt Craven) moves in and she comes to know his personal habits ""Pepsi for breakfast?"" she inquires with an intonation rarely heard since Marie Antoinette took an interest in the bakery products of the peasantry. When she is questioned about one of Waynes former secretaries she replies ""My husband had an affair with her"" implying that she ordered it to cease. When she is informed that the affair had continued without her knowledge she receives the news as if learning of a crack in a teacup. This is Mirrens film all the way not simply because she remains cool and commanding although it is perfectly true that you could store a case of Chablis in her heart but because she has the wit to push that coolness to suspicious extremes. Eileen professes love for her vanished husband and a sappy retrospective epilogue backs her up yet if Arnold werent such a loser I would seriously wonder whether she herself had set the kidnapping in motion. Mirren does all this I guess because more clearly than the men around her she sees the movies yawning fault--the nagging threat of dullness--and tries to make amends. She was equally rigorous and stiff-spined in the television series ""Prime Suspect"" but there we had an array of tasty mysteries to be savored and solved whereas ""The Clearing"" written by Justin Haythe and directed by Pieter Jan Brugge is a thriller stripped of thrills--or even worse a thriller that thinks of itself as somehow rising above the vulgar pleasures of excitement. Brugge is directing his first film here and theres no mistaking his ambition; as a producer or an executive producer he worked on ""The Insider"" ""Bulworth"" and ""Heat"" each of which was startlingly keen to stretch a genre. Yet all of them however thought-provoking took the trouble to arouse whereas ""The Clearing"" wants the thought without the provocation. The climax of the tale appears to have so embarrassed the filmmakers that we see it only in flashback as a wincing afterthought and even then we cant quite tell what occurred. I hate to say it but if Arnold ever made a movie it would look like this.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Jones The Bleader Film July 15 2004 Movies | Movie Review Tweet Pin It Reprints Share Super Human By Julien Lapointe Spider-Man 2  (A must-see) Directed by Sam Raimi Written by Michael Chabon Alfred Gough Miles Millar and Alvin Sargent With Tobey Maguire Kirsten Dunst Alfred Molina and James Franco. Who we are and how we exist in the world are central themes in superhero stories even if they get overlooked by most reviewers of comic-book movies. Its a mainstay of the genre that superheroes lead dual lives and adopt split identities. Whats interesting is the play between who these heroes are in private and how they present themselves to the world. Once in his Batman suit Bruce Wayne reveals more of his inner thoughts and feelings than he does as Bruce Wayne his hatred of criminals triggered by the loss of his parents in a mugging comes seething through. Spider-Man 2 of course is about the double life of web-slinging Spider-Man and goofy everyman Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) but its also about the perks and pitfalls of having a public identity. As in the first film Spider-Mans superhero skills are more a burden than a privilege. And here again are sappy lines about self-sacrifice and responsibility that curb the vigilantism of the comic-book original. The film doesnt apply its insights about identity as searchingly to the other characters as it does to Peter Parker/Spider-Man--a better movie would. It does however show us that theyre all defined by a world that both rewards and punishes fame one thats slightly but significantly different from the universe of the original Spider-Man comics. When Spider-Man creators Stan Lee and Steve Ditko set the action in New York they wedded their fantastic stories to realism with neighborhoods street corners offices and apartments often drawn from actual locations and a protagonist who was cut down to human proportions as well. Director Sam Raimi is good with the details too--the Flatiron Building an East Village cafe Parkers sardine-size apartment where he can barely make the rent. But through subtle additions he does something more here. His New York becomes a city that thrives on celebrity and myth a place where Spider-Man with his newsbreaking crime stopping is just another celeb hounded by the tabloids. The opening shot is a loving close-up of Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) the girl next door Parkers adored since childhood. Then the camera pulls back to reveal that were seeing her face on a billboard. Shes an up-and-coming actress and model with friends in high places when she gets engaged the film is careful to point out that the groom to be is a headline-making astronaut. The mad-scientist villain Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) also has his sights set on renown--a Nobel Prize no less. As the film sets him up there are two Octaviuses one a loving husband with a healthy personal life the other a tentacled monster wholl sacrifice even the love of his life to get ahead. Spider-Mans reputation by the start of the story is pervasive seeping into every corner of Peter Parkers life. In one well-timed gag he goes out for a walk and hears a street musician playing the theme song from the old Spider-Man TV cartoon. Raimi uses less pop-cultural references to comment on Parkers double life too Parker attends a performance of Oscar Wildes The Importance of Being Earnest starring Mary Jane as Cecily. She says to her would-be suitor Algernon whos posing under a false identity ""I hope you have not been leading a double life pretending to be wicked and being really good all the time."" At that point she looks out at the audience and fortuitously catches Parkers eye. Wildes stories often concern divided lives with characters concealing their real natures and motives behind a conventional facade. In Earnest Algernon assumes the identity of his friend Jacks brother Ernest an alleged troublemaker. As it turns out ""Ernest"" is a fictive invention of Jacks with whom Cecily knowing of him only through hearsay is smitten. Algernon has to pose as Ernest to woo Cecily. His dilemma is not unlike that faced by superheroes who win the adulation of the heroine while masked but cant get the time of day from any girl in their workaday lives. Raimi doesnt push such parallels too far. But the gags and the tongue-in-cheek tone of early parts of the film suggest how easily superhero tales of divided identity can be played as classic comedies of errors. The opening sequence has Peter Parker ordinary Joe rushing to make a pizza delivery on time. Sensing that he wont make it he changes into his Spider-Man suit and web-slings his way to his destination--only to have to change back later in a janitors closet knocking over several brooms on his way out. Its a good joke setting Spider-Mans agility against Parkers ineptitude but it also reminds us that superhero stories are not merely escapist fantasies. Spider-Man sails past the obstacles of daily life swinging from building to building; Parker stays stuck in traffic. The split between a superhero and his clumsy alter ego is a little like the divisions we all face heroes like Spider-Man are caricatures of the confidence and capability we show when we excel at a job go out on a date or play at a sport leaving behind a web of doubts--or at least trying to. Underlying the mystique of the superhero is the notion that going out into the world--especially when one has a public identity--involves a mix of self-fulfillment and repression. In the most startling scene in Spider-Man 2 our hero loses his mask while fighting Octavius on an elevated train. ""Hes just a kid"" exclaims a passenger. Being Spider-Man is an outlet for Peter Parkers superhuman strength but it also conceals that hes only human.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Charles Taylor Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Entertainment News If youre going to make adolescent self-pity the heart of a movie -- and youre not going to parody it -- then it should be so masochistically self-involved that it becomes a rapturous wallow. (Thats the brand of hysteria Elia Kazan whipped up in his roaring-hormones classics ""East of Eden"" and ""Splendor in the Grass."") ""Spider-Man 2 is too square to take that approach and not imaginative enough to take any other. For a big-budget action movie ""Spider-Man 2 is modest and not assaultive -- it has a boring decency. The pokiness of the first ""Spider-Man"" was forgivable because the picture had a sweet spirit and because it was unusual to see an action blockbuster that wasnt out to bonk you over the head every few minutes. It was also almost immediately forgettable. (About all I retain from it is Kirsten Dunst mugging as she poses for Tobey Maguire in the first scene and their later kiss in a rain-drenched alley as he in Spidey drag hangs upside down.) Like its predecessor ""Spider-Man 2 was directed by Sam Raimi. For a filmmaker who has spent much of his career dealing in the fantastic Raimi is awfully prosaic. His best movie remains the overlooked heartland noir ""A Simple Plan"" which showed what Hollywood used to call an ""invisible"" command of craft and narrative; the movie also felt as though it had been made for adults. Those same qualities were present in Raimis paranormal thriller ""The Gift."" The plot was Southern-gothic trash but the details and sense of place felt authentic and as in ""A Simple Plan"" Raimi took real care with the performances. But in his outright genre movies like the western pastiche ""The Quick and the Dead"" and the comic-book adventure ""Darkman"" Raimi has never escaped a B-movie flatness. That quality worked to the advantage of the best of them the giddy horror slapstick ""Evil Dead 2 Dead by Dawn."" The B-movie cruddiness gave the racing camera and the stop-motion dancing corpses something to bounce off. The ""Spider-Man"" movies are genre pictures writ large (or at least expensive). Raimi is a capable director who I dont think has ever demonstrated a crass impulse but he just doesnt have the excess of spirit sense of grandeur and flights of poetic imagination that a comic-book extravaganza needs. In ""Spider-Man 2 he shows flashes of a nasty wild streak. One character exits the movie in a hail of flying jagged glass. We see her screaming face reflected in the approaching shards. Its a terrific image obviously an homage to Carrie Snodgress death in ""The Fury."" But that flying glass needs to cut the movies flesh (and ours) as well as the characters and the death is too easily forgotten. Like all the best effects in the movie its muffled. Theres a promising villain this time out. Dr. Otto Octavius aka Doc Ock and played by Alfred Molina is the proverbial good scientist turned evil -- in this case when experiments to develop an alternative energy source leave him with four mechanical tentacles embedded in his spine each doing his telepathic bidding. Theyre quite a sight with their snapping jaws open like a rattler ready to strike and theres a purring menace in the way they coil around Molina like familiars. Doc Ock can use those metallic arms to crawl up buildings or to hoist himself into the air and I wanted to see those crazy arms do more inventively meaner things -- as well as to see Molina get a few arias to sing the mournfulness driving Doc Ocks rage. With their mixture of the organic and the mechanical those arms would have been catnip for David Lynch or Guillermo del Toro (whose ""Hellboy"" has all the grandeur poetry and romance missing from ""Spider-Man 2) or perhaps even David Cronenberg (if he had a sense of humor). But after hes established as a character Doc Ock is pretty much absent until the last half-hour when the filmmakers seem to suddenly remember they need a villain and bring him back. Theres a good moment when a group of New Yorkers try to protect Spider-Man by telling Doc Ock hes going to have to go through them first. He uses his mechanical arms to shove them out of his way. Couldnt he have done away with even one innocent bystander to give the movie a jolt? This is an adventure without cunning or bloodlust a fairy tale without any of the lyrical cruelty that gives fairy tales their primal power. Even when Doc Ock unleashes those fiendish arms in an operating room on a surgical team trying to remove them there isnt a drop of blood to be seen. The screenwriter Alvin Sargent wrote the scripts for ""Ordinary People"" and ""Julia."" Thats blame enough for one lifetime but Sargent cant get off scot-free here. ""Spider-Man 2 is packed with incidents but its a pileup rather than a plot. The script from a story by Michael Chabon and the team of Alfred Gough and Miles Milar is supposed to be about how Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) learns to live with the burden of being Spider-Man -- that is how a young man learns that adult life means compromise. It plays less like the education of a hero than like the tale of a young man so self-absorbed you have a hard time believing theres anything heroic in him. You Might Also Like ""Spider-Man 2 picks up two years after the first movie ends. Peter is struggling to balance his duties as Spider-Man and his life as a college student and failing miserably. Scraping by on next to no money he has a shabby one-room apartment (the landlord whos always dunning him for back rent is played by the wonderful Elya Baskin whose bulging eyes and rough manner suggest what Charlie Chaplins nemesis Eric Campbell might have done had he spoken onscreen). Hes given up pursuit of the girl he loves Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) because he fears his identity as Spider-Man will endanger her. Peters best friend Harry (James Franco) who blames Spider-Man for the death of his father (the first movies villain the Green Goblin) resents what he believes is Peters friendship with Spidey. And Peters dear old Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) is about to be tossed out of her Queens home because she cant pay the mortgage. Some of the details in that buttload of misery dont add up. I understand that college is the time to cut the apron strings but I couldnt figure out why Peter gives up his room in Aunt Mays house for a rat hole in the city -- especially when his contribution could help her pay the mortgage. (Harris is stuck with the movies worst lines but she has one good moment when she lashes out in anger at Peter for trying to refuse the 20 bucks she hands him for his birthday; you feel her resentment at being an old woman in straitened circumstances.) When we find out that M.J. is engaged to the son of Spideys nemesis newspaper editor J. Jonah Jameson is it just laziness that keeps Sargent from including a scene between M.J. and her prospective father-in-law? (Once again J.K. Simmons is so much like what you expect Jonah Jameson to be from the comic book that he gets a laugh nearly every time he opens his mouth.) And when we find out the reason Peters web-slinging powers are so erratic its a cheat. And its a cheat that reflects the particular wimpiness of the movie. Theres less torment than sheer late-adolescent petulance in Peters decision to stop being Spider-Man. When Superman gave up his powers in Richard Lesters wonderful ""Superman II"" it was so he could love Lois Lane as a mortal. Peters decision is ... cause it interferes with his course load. And Superman consciously chooses to give up his powers. Peter doesnt give up a thing. The only sacrifice he makes is to toss his Spidey costume in a trash can. How are we supposed to look at him as a hero after he walks away from a guy being mugged in an alley? Raimi frames Maguire in the forefront of this shot so we can see how badly Peter feels. (If you think he feels bad think about that poor son of a bitch in the alley.) Christopher Reeve walked away from a bully in ""Superman II"" but it was only Clark Kent that the tough was picking on. The only thing that comes together in ""Spider-Man 2 are the shortcomings of Raimi Maguire and Sargent. The scripts miscalculation of Peters decision feeds into the pedestrian quality of Raimis direction and into Maguires weightlessness. Thats not something I would have said about him in any other movie. The thing thats been great about Maguire is the lovely lost quality he has. But here he simply does not suggest a heroic presence not even the smart-ass daredevil quality Spidey has in the original comic books. If Maguire seems out of place here so does Dunst. As M.J. Dunst seems to be possessed of a held-in resentment whose source and whose target you can never quite figure out. Something in this performance reminded me of Cindy Williams spiky performance as a prefeminist teen queen in ""American Graffiti."" Like her Dunst appears to be chafing against strictures she cannot articulate. Theres zero chemistry between Maguire and Dunst. You keep wondering why Peter is making himself miserable chasing after her when two other young women in the movie are much more alluring -- Elizabeth Banks with her ghost of a dirty grin as Jamesons secretary and Mageina Tovah as his landlords daughter a big-eyed beauty teetering right on the cusp between duckling and swan. The longing and desire that should be bubbling up between Maguire and Dunst in the whole movie finally comes to the surface in the climax -- which only makes you wonder where it was for the previous two hours. (And why oh why when Raimi gets the two of them nestling in a spider web strung above the city doesnt he allow them some time to canoodle?) As before there are lots of shots of Spider-Man swinging through the canyons of Manhattan and as before despite all the millions spent on the movie they look cheap. (Spidey in particular has the unreal look of a computer-animated figure set against a backdrop into which he has not been adequately blended.)

Of course the webbing and scarlet threads and the running up and down tall buildings helped as did that green meany trying to take down Manhattan on his natty little skateboard. Still its heartening to know that no amount of chilly hipster CGI action pictures can fully dislodge the ancient human longings for love community and as Peter Parkers rosy Aunt May likes to remind her tortured nephew ""honesty fairness and justice."" Like all the other superannuated (if hardly dated) heroes of Marvel Comics heyday Spider-Man is a rallying call for the doofus and the charismatic leader in all of us -- or at least those of us who are male. In Stan Lees creations boys big and small can live the one and dream of becoming the other while indulging their longing to rescue damsels bask in the light of good fathers and kill off the bad ones. As funny and tough as they are the Spider-Man comics are palpably sincere and soft-hearted. Even the villains mad scientists the lot of them are basically nice blokes divided against themselves by their failure to draw the line between ambition and humanity. Spider-Man 2 made with most of the same cast and by most of the same team as Spider-Man under the direction of Sam Raimi is if anything more of a charmer than its predecessor. (David Koepps serviceable if corny screenplay is replaced by Alvin Sargents ditto.) When last we saw poor schlep Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) he was regretfully explaining to a downcast Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) who still didnt know his secret identity that their love was not to be. Two years on M.J. has gotten on with her acting career and is dating an astronaut (the son of Peters cranky editor to add insult to injury) as who would not when given the heave-ho by Spider-Man? Still shes sighing in the direction of Peter who is having no fun at all having been fired twice -- by a pizza-delivery service for tardiness and by his boss (the apoplectically funny J.K. Simmons) at the Daily Bugle for not taking enough photos of Spider-Man -- and nearly flunked brilliant young scientist though he is by his Columbia professor (Dylan Baker) for not doing his homework. Meanwhile his beloved uncle Ben is dead Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) is faced with foreclosure in Queens and poor Peter thinks he caused it all including the strain on his friendship with young Harry Osborn (James Franco) who holds Spider-Man responsible for the death of his father a.k.a. the Green Goblin. Serving the masses it seems is incompatible with having a life -- except apparently for Peters new role model Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) a scientist who has managed both a sparkling career in fusion research and marriage to the lovely Donna Murphy. Until that is one of his experiments runs out of control and he like the Goblin turns into a raving monster out to wreak vengeance on the whole of Manhattan with particular attention to Peter and those he loves. In other words the same old story. However there is a small problem here Molina is an actor of unusually elastic gifts but unlike Willem Dafoe who has only to bare his scary teeth to send us all scampering for the exits theres no getting around the fact that Molina has the face of a kindly basset hound even when its contorted into a deadly grimace. It doesnt help that the creature hes created and is now at the mercy of turns out to be a rather endearing tentacled thingy with inquisitive Medusan serpent heads; when Molina rears up in its slow-moving clutches one is inescapably reminded of John Cleese the Minister of Silly Walks. Until that is Doc Ock comes up with a fiery hellhole in which to sink the whole city Spider-Man and M.J. included. At which point there comes the familiar delirious delight of watching Spider-Man -- back from a brief and ill-advised hiatus as your average Joe -- swing back into gear up and down from the rooftops in and out of skyscrapers and in his way reclaiming Manhattan from the trauma of 9/11.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm Spider-Man 2 has all manner of fancy CGI improvements on its precursor but in the end its the old-style action sequences that carry it The funniest is Aunt May swatting Doc Ock with her umbrella like some demented Mary Poppins as he scrambles up the side of a building and the scariest a climactic scene involving an elevated train and some sterling representatives of the American people who become heroes themselves and remind Peter of his true calling. It is of course one thing to save whole cities and quite another to keep a relationship with a peppy redhead on the boil. In this regard it must be said Spider-Man never a bastion of feminist discourse steps up to the plate in a minor way by giving the damsel more of a say in the outcome. Dunst is a feline beauty and a remarkably adventurous young actress (if you havent seen her as Marion Davies in The Cats Meow youve missed a great performance) and notwithstanding a few campy squealing Fay Wray scenes she invests the lovely M.J. with a sturdy willfulness that leaves us confident she can take perfectly good care of herself not to mention a few million of her fellow New Yorkers. And so girls let us sit drumming our fingers and waiting for Spider-Woman The Awakening.

Rick Groen From Wednesdays Globe and Mail Published Wednesday Jun. 30 2004 118AM EDT Last updated Wednesday Apr. 08 2009 858AM EDT Comments AA Spider-Man 2 Directed by Sam Raimi Written by Alvin Sargent Alfred Gough Miles Millar and Michael Chabon Starring Tobey Maguire Kirsten Dunst Alfred Molina James Franco Classification PG Rating 1/2 At the end of another long day battling crime whats an overtaxed superhero to do? His laundry of course. So there he is a mere Peter Parker like the rest of us short on coins and forced to mix his coloureds with his whites his Spidey costume with his delicates whereupon the washer rinses and spins and spits out his bleeding alter egos into a rainbow coalition of comedy Oh no pink and blue undies. Thats when I fell hard for Spider-Man 2. In a genre where costs are routinely counted in the scores of millions heres something as rare as it is refreshing - not an obscenely expensive sight but a terrifically cheap sight gag. And yes the pricey action is pretty good too. Director Sam Raimi is back as is Tobey Maguire along with much of the principal cast and together theyve managed to demonstrate what few sequels do - that (go figure) practice can actually make for improvements. Smart yet not cerebral kinetically gifted without being flamboyant Raimi was always the right man for this comic-book job. But hes even better on the second go-round. The aerial sequences - our acrobatic arachnid swinging from his filaments across the Manhattan skyscape - are wider in frame and more exhilarating in feel. In too many of these flicks the action is frenetic and over-long and has the ironic effect of slowing down the picture. But Raimi knows when to call ""cut."" Hes got all the latest CGI toys in his play-box but handles them efficiently with clean dispatch. Where lesser directors think a huge budget is an excuse to crank out run-on sentences his cinematic grammar is crisp clear and unafraid to employ that most useful of punctuation marks - the full stop. Also unlike Ang Lee in The Hulk Raimi doesnt make the mistake of over-thinking the flimsy psychology of the genre. All this conflicted-hero stuff isnt meant to be profound; instead its there for the same reason as everything else - to give the action (the interior action in this case) a healthy shot of pop energy. Raimi walks that line perfectly neither downgrading the conflicts into mere camp or inflating them into faux Nietzsche. This Spidey aint heavy this Spidey aint light - this Spidey weighs in just right. He is pooped though. Two years have passed since his metamorphosis and constantly battling the evildoers has taken its toll. Perpetually broke chronically tired falling behind in his college classes unable to make the rent on his dingy apartment a beleaguered Peter is deeply entangled in the web of his crime-fighting duties. Ah the stress of superheroism - saving others has left him no time to nurture himself. Meanwhile old flame Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) has blossomed into a celebrated actress currently starring in an off-Broadway production of The Importance of Being Earnest (nice touch - another comic tale of confused identities). Whats worse tired of waiting for her tardy prince shes accepted a marriage proposal from a more conventional titan your garden-variety astronaut. And if that werent bad enough Spidey is suffering from an occasional bout of filamentary impotence - with annoying frequency and at the most embarrassing moments his squirter isnt squirting. Add it all up and who can blame Peter for denying his saviour. Which he does - briefly at least until the villain du jour pays him a moral wake-up call. In the interim Maguire is a continuing pleasure to watch. Physically hes an ideal fit for this bisected role because the camera cant decide who he is either - in all his films it wavers between making him leading-man handsome in one shot forgettably mundane in the next. More important his modest acting style - hes a supremely talented minimalist - meshes nicely with Raimis understated direction especially in fleshing out the comic-book psychology. Maguire brings to the self-doubting scenes his peculiar brand of spaced-out mooniness and consequently finds the same balance as the picture - neither too frivolous (we still feel his pain) nor too intense (he leaves the brooding quota to James Franco in his recurring gig as the poor little rich boy). But back to todays villain and to Alfred Molina in another neat balancing act. On the nefarious surface of things Dr. Otto Octavius is just one more mad scientist done in by his ungoverned hubris and a misguided test tube. This time the ill-fated experiment has left him with four huge steel tentacles welded to his body and waving about like the lethal flailings of a demented octopus. Or thats the idea. But since were talking about Alfred Molinas body here the idea could have easily degenerated into a laughable reality - think fat man trailing a quartet of Slinky toys. That it never does that his villain truly elevates the piece is an everlasting tribute to Molinas verve - somehow the guy suspends both his considerable anatomy and our looming disbelief. And credit Raimi with his own dexterity with a creative bit of spot-welding that grafts some impressively high-tech effects onto an essentially low-tech monster. Over all among the ranks of comic-book men with cinematic breeding Spidey 2 lacks the mythic power of the first Super or the operatic grandeur of the original Bat. Yet it has something they dont a pop modesty that not only becomes a pop hero but also - and this really takes super-power - might even sustain a pop franchise. Typically in the vast machine that is Hollywood attractive modesty and summer blockbuster are never put in the same cycle. But hey happy accidents sometimes happen - just look whats come out in the wash.

"Marvel Of A Sequel - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Spider-man Marvel Of A SequelMOVIE REVIEW - `Spider-Man 2 -  - (OUT OF FIVE)Spider-man 2 Spins Into Action With A New Bully And A Strong Plot.June 30 2004|By Jay Boyar Sentinel Movie CriticWith great power comes great responsibility as we learned along with Spider-Man a couple of years ago.By the same token with great box-office performance comes great hope for the sequel.Not a problem. Spider-Man 2 which swoops into theaters today not only meets those expectations it leaps far beyond them.Easily the film of the summer Spideys sensational sequel is also the best superhero movie in at least 15 years -- since Tim Burtons Batman.Yes the first Spider-Man was a hoot especially the wonderful way its web-slinging star swung through the skies of Manhattan. But the plot was clunky at times and the fiendish Green Goblins private moments tended to slip into melodrama.The new improved SM2 has a far smoother narrative line as well as more amazing special effects including even more terrific swinging. And this time the villain is totally marvelous.That would be Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina) a well-meaning scientist who goes over to the dark side after a lab accident leaves him with four metallic tentacles fused to his body. Naturally its up to our friendly neighborhood Spider-Man to save the day.But whats this?Our hero is going through an emotional crisis thats affecting his spider powers. Hes losing his strength agility and knack for climbing walls and spinning webs.Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) thinks hed rather just be plain old Peter Parker ace science student -- and if hes lucky boyfriend of Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) the super-hot model-actress whos currently appearing on stage in Oscar Wildes The Importance of Being Earnest.Thanks to his Spidey duties Peter keeps letting her down by missing the show. Oh what a tantalizingly tangled web our favorite human arachnid has gotten caught inSpidey didnt get there by himself of course. He had plenty of help from returning director Sam Raimi and screenwriter Alvin Sargent (Ordinary People Unfaithful). Theyve faithfully and inventively captured the offbeat spirit of the character created more than 40 years ago by comic-book writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko.Raimi and Sargent offer us tons of action including just to kick things off a breakneck bike dash through the streets of the city. Near the films end a stirring set piece features Spider-Man trying to rescue a subway trains passengers from a deadly fate.In between there are fantastic face-offs between the dark doctor with his terrifying tentacles and the wall-crawler with his often-unreliable spider powers. Its a nice touch that before Doc Ock attacks we often hear his tentacles ominously clanking as he approaches.Meanwhile on the home front the unassuming Peter cant meet the rent and fumes in frustration as a hunky astronaut (""the first man to play football on the moon"") starts to steal Mary Jane. Peter also tries to level with his sweet-but-tough Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) about the troubling circumstances surrounding the death of her beloved husband Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson).No its not Wilde but its wild and it swings.You believe in these people and care about them The luminous faces of Maguire and Dunst in an early nighttime encounter really help to sell the romance. (In fact Raimi and cinematographer Bill Pope of the Matrix series do some of the most sensitive work with close-ups in recent memory.)Once again Raimi doesnt forget to put the comic in comic book.Fans will roar when Peter discovers that Aunt May has -- horrors -- tossed out his comic-book collection. And everyone will howl at the superb comic timing in a standout scene in which Spidey and a stranger awkwardly attempt to make small talk as they share an elevator.""Cool Spidey outfit"" the man offers.""It gets kinda itchy"" our angst-ridden hero eventually reveals.As hero and villain Maguire and Molina are ideally matched. Both command a powerful stillness which in Maguires case vanishes with each sudden leap and which for Molina provides a fine counterpoint to his ever-active artificial arms.Dunst who seemed rather fragile as Mary Jane in the first film has here acquired a refreshing self-assurance. And James Franco (The Company) does yeoman work as Harry Osborn tormented son of the late Green Goblin.Whenever cobwebs threaten to slow things down up pops J.K. Simmons (the explosives expert in The Ladykillers). As blustery newspaper honcho J. Jonah Jameson hes an inspired cartoon of a paper tyrant ripped straight from the pages of Marvel Comics The Amazing Spider-Man.And speaking of Marvel lets not miss a key point With all the hype about the recent wave of Marvels superhero films most of them have been disappointing.The Hulk was an interesting dud. The X-Men flicks have their moments (and have made some money) but dont hold together.

We dont just want to re-taste the flavor of the original movie. We want the whole experience all over again. So we set ourselves up for disappointment. To add insult to ticket-buying injury we feel a little let down afterward as if the moviemakers had reneged on the contract. We go for repetition then fault the movie for repeating itself. Its a lose-lose proposition most of the time. <a href=""http//ad.doubleclick.net/jump/wpni.artsandlivingarticle/movies/reviews;dir=howenode;dir=artsandliving;dir=movies;dir=reviews;dir=howe;page=article;kw=;ad=ss;ad=bb;ad=hp;pos=ad26;sz=300x250;tile=20;abr=ie;ord=1088742841476?""></a> <a href=""http//ad.doubleclick.net/jump/wpni.artsandlivingarticle/movies/reviews;dir=howenode;dir=artsandliving;dir=movies;dir=reviews;dir=howe;page=article;kw=;ad=ss;ad=bb;ad=hp;pos=ad27;sz=160x600;tile=20;abr=ie;ord=1088742841476?""></a> <a href=""http//ad.doubleclick.net/jump/wpni.artsandlivingarticle/movies/reviews;dir=howenode;dir=artsandliving;dir=movies;dir=reviews;dir=howe;page=article;kw=;ad=ss;ad=bb;ad=hp;pos=ad24;sz=336x850;tile=20;abr=ie;ord=1088742841477?""></a> ""Spider-Man 2"" avoids this trap thanks to one inbuilt dumb-luck reason The original Marvel Comics story has some narrative developments. These events which happen to Spider-Man take more than one movie to occur. Im talking specifically about the relationship between Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). Usually a superhero cannot find the happy medium between his secret life and the normal one he would love to live if only he hadnt been the victim of a gamma ray experiment or an interspecies evolution or traumatized by the death of his parents etc. ""Spider-Man 2"" explores the possibilities of finding that balance between superheroic and normal life. Ill leave it at that. Plus this movie directed with precision and an appreciation for (relatively) rich character texture by Sam Raimi remembers all the fine elements of the original film (and the comic book story). It reprises them perfectly including wonderfully choreographed skyscraper-hanging fights. And once again you can expect that red-eyed failure-prone vulnerability from Peter Parker/Spider-Man and his tortured relationship with Mary Jane. Oh how exquisitely frustrating it is In this installment (well of course there are more films to come) she is engaged to the good-looking upstanding John Jameson (Daniel Gillies). Theres no reason for her to look back at the scrawny Peter who for reasons only we understand cannot become her lover. (A superhero doesnt need a romantic Achilles heel not with all those supervillains looking for weaknesses to exploit.) But she does look back. She knows theres something there. And that frustrated passion is memorably underlined by Dunsts one-of-a-kind voluptuousness. As Mary Jane she is pale delicate beautiful and built like Jessica Rabbit; and those green eyes convey her emotions with such emphasis youre ready to push the conflicted Peter into her arms yourself. Without this relationship Spider-Mans just another superhero. The movie also reprises the charmingly hokey affection between Peter and his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris). Seen through the prism of comic book sentimentality it has a sort of old-fashioned poignancy. ""Spider-Man 2"" also brings back the movies best caricature tabloid publisher J. Jonah Jameson. J.K. Simmons a fabulous character actor who was the memorable Garth Pancake in the Coen brothers ""The Ladykillers"" is crackingly hilarious as Jameson bent on selling papers on the defamed back of Spider-Man. Have Jameson and Rupert Murdoch ever been photographed together? Its worth investigating. And in this movie we have a fascinating villain Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) a scientist who (through the usual accident) is fused with the evil he has wrought a man caught and forever connected to four metallic pincered arms. As this new creation Doc Ock hes powered by a lethal fusion of energy enough to equal the sun (or something). Played with a combination of pantomime sensitivity and cackling evil by Molina hes a reasonably compelling villain. I say ""reasonably"" because Raimi and his cluster of writers (including Columbia native Michael Chabon and the great Alvin Sargent) could have taken this creation to higher heights. Hes not as psychotically evil as youd hope. And one huge opportunity is missed. The movie could have made a little more of Octaviuss heartbreak over the love that he has lost thanks to this evil transformation. (Again Ill leave it at that.) Giving him fuller dimension would have raised ""Spider-Man 2"" to a higher level making Doc Ocks Manichaean struggles (not only between himself and Spider-Man but within himself) formidable. But all in all ""Spider-Man 2"" is as fine a repeat experience as our foolish creativity-challenged tradition of sequelizing allows. You cant ask for more than that.

Thats good not bad. In fact thats very good. It shows that all concerned in the second installment of this mega-franchise -- most important director Sam Raimi returning from his love-labor of the first one -- have looked hard at the success of the original and have understood and preserved its core. Which is to say that ""Spider-Man 2"" may be the most internalized superhero vs. monster movie ever made. Though buildings crumble an arachno-man swings an octo-man crushes and the earth trembles its really about whats going on inside where each of the antagonists mulls fate vs. character wishes things were otherwise wants more settles for less and generally carries on like Holden Caulfield walking around the East Side in that goofy hat all those years ago. Oh and incidentally the movie cleverly solves one of the most difficult technical issues of the monster movie in a way no film ever has. But more on that later. Lets begin with Peter Parker. Hes still a kid -- when hes 77 Maguire will look like a kid -- with a quivery voice a forlorn look of befuddlement and anxiety a boys tentative way of moving and doubts about self and destiny. And he is still in love. Pete lives with his aunt -- the great Rosemary Harris -- and his heartstrings go bing-bing-bing over the girl next door except that shes become a model and an actress and no longer lives next door on Staten Island but in swanky Midtown digs. It helps if you have a thing for ex-child star Kirsten Dunst and I dont so I have to fake it here. To my ungrateful eyes Dunst has flat hair and a wan face; she could have used some orthodontia as a child as well if she hadnt been so busy acting. But that aside the movies central emotional tussle is the doomed yearning love between Pete and Mary Jane. When one is available the other isnt. And now that shes high-powered in the glitzy artistic-fashion world and hes er delivering pizzas by day and saving the city by night it looks like theyll never get it together. But each looks and weeps for what might have been so the movie is built on a hollow ache in the heart that even we non-super people feel once in a while. (Unless youre a critic of course; we werent issued hearts.) Meanwhile -- its fair to chide the film for repeating the plot device of the first -- a genius scientist Professor Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) is trying to develop a new energy source under the sponsorship of Peters rich-boy pal Harry Osborn (James Franco) who is the son of the villain of the first picture Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe). Dr. Octaviuss technology goes very wrong -- splosions flames lectricity -- killing his wife and a legion of anonymous lab assistants and turning him into an angry metal freak that is a man with four gigantic prehensile arms harnessed to his nervous system capable of incredible strength violence and agility. This puts him in a very bad mood and before you can say ""Good lord Myra its alive"" hes off on a destructive toot expressing his rage at his failure. Okay kids whats the problem solved? The problem is this In most monster movies where the sub-theme is man-becomes-monster the monster ends up being so different from the man that you feel nothing for it. Its new its different its not affiliated with the man before it. It has no emotional connection to the investment in empathy youve already made in the picture. This problem is ubiquitous; most famously it undercut the end of the original ""Terminator"" where -- his flesh and Arnold Schwarzeneggerian mug melted away -- the Terminator was just a clanking metallic gizmo of no emotional resonance. It was like watching a fight between Linda Hamilton and a can opener. Here the brilliance of Raimi is that Molina never ceases to be Molina; his face doesnt disappear in some larger amorphous mass. His body doesnt go away. Hes always Molina Its Molinas character his malevolence as reflected in his snarl the black hubris of his eyes the droopy flop of his old-guy body the vitality of his nasty line readings. Okay so? The guys got ""It Came From Beneath the Seas"" gigantic tentacles affixed and if he wants he can slap the Chrysler Building into a pile of rubble. This sets up a number of arachno vs. octopod confrontations in downtown Gotham or in a computerized version thereof. Who knows how they do this stuff? What is important is that its pretty believable more on the strength of the dynamism of the movement (which is the most authentic thing about the sequences) than on the verisimilitude of the characters. To my eyes Spidey and Doc Ock in action up there beyond the 75th floor never cease to be slightly rubberized artificial objects. But the cutting is so sinuous and breathtaking the music (by Danny Elfman after too much coffee) so onrushing and the camera so penetrative of the depths and heights of midtown Manhattan at cloud level that the illusion despite its artificiality works. You dont believe it but you ""believe"" it. The best of these effects involves a runaway elevated train with Spidey atop it flinging out cables of web to brake the momentum and Ock urging it onward toward a track that ends depositing the contrivance in midair Spidey aboard. Maguire with his dim eyes (he must be the least expressive good actor in Hollywood) and his forlorn voice gives the movie an emotional center utterly rare for this sort of thing. You can love ""Spider-Man 2"" and not hate yourself in the morning. Spider-Man 2 (127 minutes at area theaters) is PG-13 rated for dynamic bloodless pop violence.

At least if youre Wayne you have a butler to run interference and a manor under which to build your bat-cave Money does make it so much easier to leap among disparate roles in an over-compartmentalized life. At the other extreme there is Peter Parker/Spider-Man--desperately impoverished lovelorn without confidants persecuted by an unscrupulous tabloid editor when he dons his spider suit and racked with guilt when he doesnt. The gravely splendid Spider-Man 2 (Columbia Pictures) again directed by Sam Raimi dramatizes this schism as powerfully as any superhero picture since Superman II (1980) Its protagonist (Tobey Maguire) is so conflicted that neither side of him can properly function. The movie is a cut above the pretty-darn-good original The special effects are more tightly woven into the human drama the villain is better dramatized (and acted by Alfred Molina) and the love story is a few notches up the evolutionary scale from the first movies adolescent infatuation. But its the tone of the picture thats most striking. This is nothing less than a superheros lament--Spidey Agonistes a comic-book spectacle in which the primary struggles are behind the mask. Advertisement There were a lot of threads left dangling in the last Spidey movie which is gorgeously recapped in a credit sequence limned by the great Marvel artist Alex Ross a look back in anguish with a score by Danny Elfman that hits notes of both yearning and unrest. Amid the comic-book panels is a recurring picture of Mary Jane ""M.J."" Watson (Kirsten Dunst)--the only photo-realist touch as if she exists on more than a single plane. She is certainly the most solid thing in Peter Parkers life. The opening finds him at loose ends. His romance with M.J. has been choked off with neither party sure just what to do now. His best friend Harry (James Franco) has sworn vengeance against his alter ego--and cant let the subject drop. His college grades have nosedived. His finances have dwindled to the point where hes begging to keep a pizza delivery-boy job. He lives in a noisy hovel with a landlord who seems to take sadistic pleasure in chasing him for rent. He cant seem to keep an appointment. His time is out of joint. And things are no happier on the superhero front. In the first film Peters discovery that his teenage body could suddenly shoot white sticky stuff was confusing but also scary and exhilarating--as it is for so many of us. Now he discovers that once in a while when there are a lot of other things on his mind that sticky stuff wont come. In Peters case more than self-esteem is at stake A couple of 30-story plunges to the street are enough to make even the most Olympian superheroic athlete quiver with performance anxiety. Its a long downward trajectory for poor Peter. For the first 90 minutes he cant catch a break and the only thing that keeps Spider-Man 2 from becoming too much of a Job-like downer is Maguires lightness and magnanimity. I dont know how to praise this actor enough Hed win a sweetness contest with Jake Gyllenhaal. Hearing the news that M.J. has a boyfriend his head sinks as if it suddenly weighs 300 pounds. He forces it up gives it a shake manages a sickly smile and stammers ""Thats good ... companionship ... "" That gentle high slightly hoarse voice that touch of effeminacy in his manner Its no wonder that almost every woman alive wants to eat him up. Theres still alas only a tenuous link between Peter and that little digitized computer-game figure that hurtles with impossible fluidity through those wide CGI avenues. I had hoped that Raimi and his army of FX people would get a little more real with the action this time but the figures of Spider-Man and his tentacled antagonist Doc Ock are often downright cartoony. That said theyve made these sequences explosively kinetic with sharp angles rock-em-sock-em editing and a brilliantly three-dimensional cityscape. The action is unreal but it spins your head bombards your senses and otherwise envelops you. Its the closest thing to a virtual-reality comic book without a helmet. It helps that the filmmakers have demystified the Spider-Man costume It gets laundered (badly) dumped in a trashcan and finally mounted on the wall of the office of the cigar-wielding editor J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons). In climactic scenes the superhero is only partially costumed--Peters head on Spideys body. The disjunction is painful the superhero both inside him--in his DNA--yet alien to his nature. After one excruciating feat of heroism Peter lies unconscious on the floor of a subway his face naked and the passengers register the discontinuity as we do. One of them murmurs ""Hes just a kid."" They might have said the same of the movies villain Dr. Otto Octavius. Molina looks more than ever like an overgrown bull-calf--soulful not unkind but prone to snorting and charging when he doesnt get his way. He doesnt get his way--big time. After a cataclysmic attempt at creating nuclear fusion he ends up bereft mad and more to the point controlled by four giant nano-chip-generated tentacles that snap and hiss into his ears like H.R. Gigers aliens. His tentacles hoist him up and propel him along and Raimi is careful to emphasize the disjunction here too--the real man in the middle with his beer belly hanging out. Doc Ock might have been a comic sight if it werent for the directors horror chops. The villains awakening sets the tone an operating-room massacre thats like the second Evil Dead picture compressed into one furious bloodcurdling minute--complete with chainsaw. The script--which is credited to the veteran Alvin Sargent with a story by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar and tantalizingly the novelist Michael Chabon--is beautifully worked-out but at times it takes itself a bit too seriously. I could have done without half of Aunt Mays big speech about how kids need a hero--although not without the great Rosemary Harris impassioned delivery. But by then theres a ton of feeling pent up a dam waiting to bust. The climax isnt a battle its Spidey and M.J. high above the city having their moment at long last. And Spider-Mans final swing is exultant like a Fred Astaire happy dance. Spider-Man 2 has the cleanest emotional arc of any comic-book movie ever. For all the simulation it breathes.

(You never hear anyone talking about ""winter movies"" do you?) Like fizzy lemonade or a sudden cool breeze a well-crafted summer movie brings uncomplicated pleasure; fleeting but delicious. And its my great pleasure to tell you that Sam Raimis marvelous ""Spider-Man 2"" is as good as summer movies get. Get in line and pass the popcorn; this is undoubtedly the most fun youll have at the multiplexes this season or maybe even this year. This sequel had some pretty well-stretched tights to fill ""Spider-Man"" released back in May 2002 was a terrific jump-start for the franchise. Tobey Maguire quavery-voiced and sincere proved to be an inspired choice as Peter Parker the lonely young orphan who acquires spiderlike powers and great strength when bitten by a radioactive spider on a class field trip. The skinny pale kid is nobodys idea of a superhero so he easily slips into a double life as nerdy Peter and the masked ""friendly neighborhood Spider-Man."" Unsuspected by the girl he loves from afar Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) he learns to accept the great responsibility that comes with great power. If the first ""Spider-Man"" was a coming-of-age story the new film is the portrait of a superhero as a young man. Taking place two years after the events of the first movie (a clever intricate opening credit sequence reminds us of what happened then) ""Spider-Man 2"" drops us into Peters new life which involves not only part-time superherodom and work as a free-lance photographer for the Daily Bugle but also college classes a job delivering pizzas a threadbare apartment in Manhattan and severe financial problems. (Careful attention has been paid to visual detail and it pays off in a wealth of character notes Peter for example is exactly the sort of 20-year-old who takes the time to neatly make his bed every day.) Other aspects of Peters life are familiar. He still loves Mary Jane whos clearly his soul mate (her soulful sky-blue eyes match his) but cant tell her out of concern for her safety. She now an up-and-coming young actress has grown tired of his promises and met somebody else. And theres a new threat to the citys safety Dr. Octavius known as Doc Ock (Alfred Molina). Previously a brilliant scientist researching fusion techniques he is transformed after a terrible accident into a multi-tentacled villain. Meanwhile Peters friend Harry (James Franco) is moving into his own subplot he blames Spider-Man for the death of his father and plots to avenge him -- if only he could learn the masked mans identity. ""Youd tell me if you knew who Spider-Man was wouldnt you?"" he asks Peter who avoids his gaze. All these threads intertwine in Alvin Sargents screenplay which stays resolutely true to these characters while leaving plenty of room to show off the films stellar special effects. A duel between Doc Ock and Spidey staged on the outside wall of a vast Manhattan apartment building is magical Ocks legs have a coiling leering life of their own. And in a late sequence Spider-Man wildly swings through the streets of Manhattan as if taking us on an out-of-control guided tour. His swoops and swirls are even more balletic this time around -- some of his toe-pointed poses in the air are worthy of Baryshnikov -- and the effects are so seamless you feel like youre on a breathless ride with him. ""Spider-Man 2"" bubbles over with small pleasures the high-voltage bellowing of J.K. Simmons as Daily Bugle editor J. Jonah Jameson; the all-too-casual introduction of characters sure to play more of a role next time around (a landlords spindly daughter a sympathetic professor); Molinas gleeful villainy under his acreage of eyebrows; the sweet wistful chemistry between Maguire and Dunst who play their scenes with an honesty and directness thats rare in any film. Take out the love story and youd still have a nifty action flick; delete the special effects and a beautifully acted romance would remain. Put it all together and ... hey its going to be a ""Spider-Man"" summer. Bring on the next one; I cant wait.

Spider-Man 2 starring Tobey Maguire and Alfred Molina. Being Spider-Man is no easy job. But the new film is seamless. 1 / 3 Back to Gallery SPIDER-MAN 2 Action. Starring Tobey Maguire Alfred Molina and Kirsten Dunst. Directed by Sam Raimi. (PG-13. 127 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Instead of coasting on the formula that made the first ""Spider-Man"" an enormous international hit the talented people behind ""Spider-Man 2"" have refreshed it. This second installment of the series is at once deeper and funnier than the original with a greater emphasis on the human side of the story. At the same time the new movie marks a vast improvement on the originals special effects The cartoony hatched-on-a-computer-screen look is a thing of the past. Heres a comic book adventure that strikes a perfect balance between action and story. The movie compromises nothing in the way of thrills and spectacle. Spider-Man still swings from buildings although this time we worry about him a bit more and theres still a monster of sorts for him to face a human octopus-man with a plan to blow up New York City just for fun. But at no point does director Sam Raimi lose control and indulge in spectacle for its own sake. He doesnt get carried away and forget hes making a movie not an amusement park ride. Most people will like this movie but thats not such a big deal. The much bigger deal is that the people who like it will like all parts of it; theres nothing to simply endure. Raimi -- with the indispensable collaboration of screenwriter Alan Sargent and story writers Alfred Gough Miles Millar and Michael Chabon -- has succeeded in making what Ang Lee tried to make with ""Hulk"" a thinking persons comic-book movie. Raimi and his writers succeed by realizing that the thinking has to be comic-book thinking and the crises have to be comic-book crises. This is not ""Hamlet."" By embracing rather than distorting the original material the filmmakers are able to breathe life into it and present a film thats all of a piece. If the first ""Batman"" movie explored the existential angst of the superhero life then ""Spider-Man 2"" shows the practical consequences of it. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a mess. Hes exhausted from late hours spent fighting crime. He cant hold down a job. Hes failing in school. Hes living in a dump and falling behind on the rent. Hes in love with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) but hes afraid to subject her to the dangers that a romance with Spider-Man might bring. Its a life that would be difficult enough for a rich guy like Batman or a middle-class guy like Superman. For a struggling young man like Peter Parker being Spider-Man is a selfless expensive life- consuming soul-draining and romance-robbing existence. Though the tone remains reasonably light the movie builds an intense sympathy for Peter for whom no good deed goes unpunished. With his sensitive face and a courteousness that goes almost to the point of social paralysis Tobey Maguire gives us a superhero who is also an underdog. In his real-life incarnation he doesnt command respect -- at best just maternal indulgence. The world treats him with indifference or contempt and yet he continues to devote himself to a course of life-risking altruism without ever taking a bow -- without it ever seeming to occur to him that he could or should. Its hard to imagine a more selfless hero. The unstated commitment behind such civic devotion increases the audiences sense of Peters stature and also makes us believe in the monumental intensity of his devotion to Mary Jane. It doesnt hurt that as played by Kirsten Dunst Mary Jane seems worthy of it -- a comic book character whos no cartoon but a sharp and talented young woman with a blossoming acting career. ""Spider-Man 2"" gets a big lift from its villain who is more interesting and complex than the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) who leered and laughed his way through the first ""Spider-Man"" movie. Dr. Otto Octavius starts off as a scientist studying fusion. By turns jolly and arrogant in Alfred Molinas portrayal hes a fellow who can go either way -- until an experiment goes wrong and he goes all the way in the evil direction. With four giant metal arms coming out of his spine Dr. Octopus is able to climb buildings and put his metal pincers through walls. When he walks the streets the ground shakes. The films visuals are brilliantly realized. When Dr. Octopus scoops Mary Jane up in his claws and climbs up a building in New Yorks West Village theres no doubting it. Its seamless. Likewise Spider-Mans swinging stunts are convincing and dont have a whiff of the computer about them. Well maybe a whiff but no more. ""Spider-Man 2"" is smart fun entertainment made by people who took nothing for granted including the audience. -- ADVISORY This film contains superhero violence.

His Love Life. College. A Friendship. As The Sequel Shows Things Can Get Sticky Even For A Superhero.By Carrie Rickey INQUIRER MOVIE CRITICPosted June 29 2004Much as I enjoyed watching Peter Parker develop his arachnid alter ego in Spider-Man Tobey Maguire was still something of the Spider-Boy.This time around the web hes lost the teen angst and all spinnerets firing he untangles the contradictions of being a student a superhero and a man in love.So what if Peter hasnt learned to sort the laundry and his Spidey suit bleeds pinkish splotches on his tidy whities?Spider-Man 2 is a deeply satisfying and involving sequel one that builds upon the complications of the first but stands on its own.With director Sam Raimi at the helm and Maguire in the hot seat this franchise is about the challenges of simultaneously mustering moral and physical strength.Just as Spider-Man struggles to strike a balance between doing whats right for others and whats right for himself Raimi and Maguire struggle to find the balance between psychological and physical action. In doing so they subvert the conventions of the action flick. Who would have imagined that stillness and silence would be so dramatically effective in a genre that typically plays at hyper-pace and eardrum-shattering din?Maguire that improbable star possesses a spiderlike calm. The globe spins off its axis the subway car hurtles off the tracks but his Spider-Man holds on by a thread the still point in a turning world. Without visibly emoting the puppy-eyed performer suggests a richer spectrum of feelings than a rainbow of screen actors. He is enormously moving and his deadpan delivery makes him enormously funny too.The humor in Spider-Man 2 is mostly of the rueful variety. Depleted from saving New Yorkers in jeopardy and also from working as a pizza delivery man Spidey/Peter cuts classes at Columbia much to the consternation of his professors and friends. If anyone took the time to look into his transparent eyes they would be able to see that hes got a secret.Peter cant tell his best chum Harry Osborn (James Franco) that hes Spider-Man because Harry wants to kill the superhero who killed his father archvillain Green Goblin. Peter cant tell Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) the girl he loves because he worries that she might become a target for his enemies.And before Peter can tell his secret to his new mentor Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) the scientists latest invention takes over the inventor. The machine meant to harness energy through fusion instead fuses to its creator turning him into a four-tentacled madman whom Spidey must subdue. Doc Ock is a more formidable less cartoony nemesis than the Green Goblin but Im speaking as one more interested in Spider-Man 2s emotional affects than its special effects.I also like that when Our Hero starts swinging from skyscrapers hes not just emulating Tarzan but is working out the Newtonian physics of action and reaction.Despite cheesy sequences in which Doc Ock holds Manhattan in the grip of his mechanical tentacles from conception to execution Spider-Man is an unusually well-wrought film. Working from a story developed by novelist Michael Chabon (The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay) and action-film scribes Alfred Gough and Miles Millar (Shanghai Noon) screenwriter Alvin Sargent (Ordinary People) powerfully imagines the ordinary struggles and domestic dilemmas of a superhero.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Running time 127 minutes. Rated PG-13 (action violence). At the Astor Plaza the Union Square the Chelsea West others. SEQUELS dont get much better - or smarter - than the action- drama- romance- and comedy-packed ""Spider-Man 2"" which miraculously improves on the webslingers hugely popular first screen adventure in every imaginable department. This time around Spideys alter-ego Peter Parker is suffering more than any screen hero since ""The Passion of the Christ."" He faces dismissal from two part-time jobs (one hilariously as a pizza deliveryman) hes flunking out of Columbia University - and hes facing eviction from his dismal cold-water apartment on the Lower East Side. Worse he cant commit to longtime love Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) for fear his Spider-Man activities would put her in harms way. M.J. finally gets so fed up with his ambivalence that she gets engaged to astronaut John Jameson (Daniel Gillies) son of Peters sometimes boss and Spidey nemesis the blustering yellow journalist J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons). The stress reaches such proportions that Peter tosses his Spidey suit in the trash - after the colors run when he washes it with white underwear and his powers start behaving erratically - and he momentarily becomes carefree in a montage set to ""Raindrops Keep Fallin on My Head"" (a hoot) and is free to pursue M.J. But their reunion doesnt exactly go swimmingly. A fusion experiment gone amuck has transformed Peters scientist idol Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) into Doc Ock a raving madman bent on world domination - whose mind is controlled by four hissing steel tentacles that allow him to climb buildings as well and as fast as Spidey. Soon Dr. Octavius - egged on by Harry Osborne (James Franco) increasingly unhinged by the notion that Peters ""pal"" Spider-Man killed his father the Green Goblin - has his tentacles around both Peters Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) and M.J. Peter reclaims his Spidey suit to do battle with Doc Ock - most memorably on an elevated subway line that runs across Manhattan. ""Spider-Man 2"" explores much the same territory as the original but Sam Raimis direction is more nimble - and it far better integrates the dramatic and action scenes which all but dominated the second half of No. 1. The script credited to Oscar-winner Alvin Sergeant (""Ordinary People"") - with an assist from three other writers including Pulitzer Prizewinner Michael Chabon (""The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier amp; Clay"") - is unusually literate and witty. There are long dialogue sequences - including one where Peter finally confesses to Aunt May that he feels responsible for her husbands death - that show faith in the attention span of audiences that is extremely rare in summer blockbusters. Tobey Maguire is terrific as the conflicted hero and he and Dunst (whose M.J. is now an actress appearing in ""The Importance of Being Earnest"") once again have palpable chemistry together even if there is no single scene as memorable as the upside-down kiss in the first ""Spider-Man."" Molinas Doc Ock - whose almost Shakespearean inner turmoil mirrors Peters - is a far more interesting villain than Willem Dafoes hammy Green Goblin. Franco as the latters son does a little scenery chewing of his own as the now-alcoholic Harry (complete with an odd product placement for Makers Mark). But Harris Aunt May is wonderful - given not only a big action sequence and a funny scene where she applies for a bank loan to stave off eviction but a moving soliloquy in which she lectures Peter about our need for heroes. That need is ably and stylishly filled with ""Spider-Man 2"" which incidentally has far more convincing special effects than Spideys jerky skyscraper-crawling last time around. Bravo.

Director Sam Raimi (207). PG-13 Comic-book-style violence. 3.5 STARS Its a very human Spidey who swoops gymnastically through the canyons of Manhattan in the richly satisfying ""Spider-Man 2"" opening at midnight in several theaters throughout the city. The movie opens wide tomorrow. Directed by comic-book aficionado Sam Raimi this sequel to the 2002 blockbuster based on the Marvel Comics character picks up with an overextended Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) trying to keep it together. Hes got homework for his Columbia University science classes and a part-time job delivering pizza at breakneck speed - and his unexpressed love for former next-door neighbor M.J. (Kirsten Dunst) is burning him up. Then there are the demands of his secret life. Peter moonlights as Spider-Man that misunderstood hero whose ears perk up at the sound of a police sirens wail. Where there is trouble or injustice Spidey swings to the rescue. By stretching himself so thin Peter is living in squalor flunking out and dishonest with his friends. Even his web-slinging powers are failing - as if they too have given up on him. Spider-Mans huge glassine eyes seem moist with the misery of the ages. ""Spider-Man 2"" is a perfect blend of summer action a big movie with a deeply personal story. The chases and battles are stunningly rendered with Spidey ping-ponging off skyscrapers and landmarks courtesy of special effects. Our hero slows a runaway elevated train (a phantom Second Ave. el?) with such effort that his limp body is then passed mosh-pit style worshipfully over the heads of the rescued passengers. Like Batman Spidey is a part-time hero and full-time conflicted mortal whose conscience wont let him rest. Does he really want to sacrifice all earthly joys to lead the lonely life of a superhero? He thinks not. The responsibilities of being Spider-Man are daunting. It means a life without love because anyone close to him would be forever in jeopardy. And he cant keep promises because theres always something bigger demanding his attention. Even with his beloved aunt (Rosemary Harris) facing bankruptcy there are other priorities. This leaves Peter with the ultimate irony that the more responsibly he plies his secret trade in saving lives the more his everyday crowd rejects him as unreliable and flaky. Hes never on time with the pizzas unavailable for M.J.s first acting gig and unable to keep a job. So he hangs up the homemade uniform. But can he really retire when the city is being terrorized by Dr. Octopus? Doc Ock (Alfred Molina) is a scientist whose misguided experiment with fusion leaves him with four mechanical tentacles fused to his spinal column directing his brain to harness alternative power sources for evil. Raimi showers the movie with humor and visual delights 50s sci-fi compositions comic-book references and in-jokes for Spidey fans even though the story takes certain liberties with the characters abilities and the frequency with which he entrusts his secret to others. The sound design is dense with all things metal as Doc Ock heartily clangs along on those dexterous extra limbs. Molina makes a fine gloating nemesis to Maguires somewhat tender boyish Spider-Man. The returning Dunst is again a perfect girl next door - lovely feisty vulnerable undervalued. But the movies key line is uttered by Harris playing that indefatigable aunt from Queens ""I believe theres a hero in all of us.""

But since his comics origin in 1962 Spider-Man has clung to an opposing mantra ""With great power comes great responsibility."" Director Sam Raimi -- a fan since childhood -- stayed true to that spirit in 2002s Spider-Man dutifully retelling the origin of the heroic web-spinner and his humble alter ego Peter Parker. Raimi then shouldered the responsibility of following up an 821 million global smash by daring to direct its sequel. What a sequel it is. Freed from the first films expository constraints Spider-Man 2 races from the gate with the gallop of a champion. Sensational enough for power-fantasy fans it also tells a strong story that tugs agreeably on our heartstrings. Hip to the special spark that humanity gives superheroes -- a formula that lofted Marvel from scrappy upstart to publishing giant -- Raimi plays up the soap opera of Peters personal life without sacrificing action-movie momentum. When last seen Peter (Tobey Maguire) had isolated himself from his beloved Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) to protect her in case Spider-Mans enemies learned his identity. Two years later Peter is missing college classes and failing at small jobs because hes been sidetracked saving New Yorkers from disaster. Meanwhile his sweet Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) is about to lose her modest home to the bank. And when Peter belatedly tries to reconcile with Mary Jane despite his better judgment the webbing hits the fan. Plagued by doubts he even seems to be losing his powers. But theres nothing like a bad guy to focus a fella. Enter Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) a respected scientist whose experiments with fusion power involve four long mechanical arms. When a demo goes kerplooey the arms weld to his torso and start showing wicked wills of their own. He then becomes Dr. Octopus or Doc Ock a durable Spidey villain since 1963s Amazing Spider-Man No. 3. Warped by suffering Ock is tangled in a web snaring Peter and friend Harry Osborn (James Franco) who blames Spidey for the death of his father Norman Osborn -- the Green Goblin -- in the first film. An inheritance brat Harry will fund Ocks experiments if he delivers Spidey for vengeance. The ensuing melees are the most spectacular superpowered action ever seen on screen especially a runaway train ride that builds to an excruciating crescendo. Raimi also draws upon his creepy Evil Dead flicks for a twisted emergency-room scene the movies darkest moment. Even more spiderlike than Spider-Man Ock skitters across walls and thunders like a Jurassic Park dino as he stomps Manhattans streets with pounding writhing tentacles their voracious tips snapping like metal mouths. Its an inspired effect that couldnt have been achieved until the computer-generated era. Spideys wild web-swinging through New Yorks steel canyons also gains zip. Yet none of this plays as action for actions sake. Rather it flows seamlessly from a tight screenplay by two-time Oscar winner Alvin Sargent. The result is the finest comic-book movie since 1992s Batman Returns another first sequel. The second time it seems is the charm. Even Maguires typical mumbling and underplaying doesnt detract since Peter so often is dazed by dilemmas. Hed be awful as a swaggering superhero but as conscience-wracked Peter/Spidey Maguire is touchingly downtrodden and resolute when forced. Molina shows cunning and intelligence behind his flamboyance and his Ock is conflicted -- as much victim as villain. Hes also recognizably human unlike Willem Dafoes masked Goblin. Mary Jane has become a top model and actress a career arc that Dunst doesnt sell as well as her torch-carrying for Peter. A third side to their romantic triangle is John Jameson (Daniel Gillies) astronaut son of J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) the boorish editor who rakes muck against Spidey with show-stealing histrionics. Raimi keeps it all clipped and snappy without getting overheated injecting humor in the right doses. Mostly he treats Spider-Man 2 as a thrilling adventure propelled by courage in the face of frailty. In-jokes include a glimpse of Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee a line about Marvels Dr. Strange a nod to the fan nightmare of having a comics collection tossed out and a sly stab at the back pains that almost sidelined Maguire. We also meet Dr. Curt Connors (Dylan Baker) who became the villainous Lizard three issues after Ock was born -- and who might be back for Spidey 3. Raimi covers still more bases from the comics early run including a messy secret-identity spill. With 42 years of history to serve he must have felt a great responsibility. With Spider-Man 2 he has honored it.

RELATED  The man pulling Spider-Mans strings YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Stan Lee Tobey Maguire Kirsten Dunst or Create your own Manage alerts | What is this? (CNN) -- ""Spider-Man 2"" joins ""Shrek 2"" as a 2004 blockbuster sequel thats every bit as good -- if not better -- than the original. Two great sequels in one summer. No mean feat that. In the new ""Spider-Man"" two years have passed since Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) walked away from his true love Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and decided to take the road of responsibility as Spider-Man. But hes finding the burden of being a superhero more than he bargained for and things have reached a crisis. Parker is trying to hold down a job as a pizza delivery guy remain a full-time student at Columbia University keep his feelings for Mary Jane at bay and still be the Spider-Man on whom everyone has come to depend. Talk about a tough job.This mild-mannered Average Joe quality is what makes this particular superhero so accessible to fans and director Sam Raimi -- along with numerous screenwriters including Alvin Sargent (who won Academy Awards for his screenplays for 1977s""Julia"" 1980s ""Ordinary People"") -- underscore Parkers ordinary-guy persona every chance they get.Parker isnt the only character audiences can relate to. Even the villain this time out -- Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) -- is a reluctant bad guy with everyman qualities. Molina who starts out a promising scientist involved in an experiment gone wrong is great in the role of ""Doc Ock.""Having a well-rounded villain makes the story and the dilemmas suffered by our protagonist more plausible than say the comic book plots in other films even the ""Batman"" or the ""X-Men"" series. Lets not even mention ""Daredevil.""(OK giant steel arms growing out of Octavius back is a far cry from plausible -- but this is based on a comic book.)Great runaway train Spider-ManWhile upping the emotional ante Raimi has not forgotten that action is king in a summer movie and there are plenty of razzle-dazzle heart-pounding adrenaline-pumping action sequences. Indeed a scene featuring runaway subway cars is the best use of a train in an action sequence Ive seen since ""The Fugitive.""James Franco is back as Peters best friend Harry Osborn whos still nursing a grudge against Spider-Man for killing his father (Willem Dafoe) aka the Green Goblin in the original film. His seething anger is pitch perfect. (Perhaps Franco is remembering that he auditioned for the role of Peter Parker and lost out to Maguire.) Alfred Molina plays ""Spider-Man 2s"" villain Dr. Otto Octavius who becomes Doctor Octopus.Rosemary Harris also returns as Peters Aunt May and her role is more active than it was in her first outing.J.K. Simmons continues to be a hoot playing Peters cigar-chomping scenery-chewing boss at the Daily Bugle newspaper where Peters claim to fame is his ability to capture Spider-Man on film. Its never made clear how Peter can fly through the air as Spider-Man while taking his own pictures at the same time but whatever.(Editors note Several readers have since written in to say Parker uses timers or remote controls on his cameras which are set up in advance of his Spidey derring-do.)""Spider-Man 2"" is faithful to the spirit of Stan Lees invention and the Marvel comics that made this action hero so beloved.

"Hero sandwiched - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Hero sandwiched Spider-Man 2 spins a compelling tale A superteen squeezed between his awesome abilities and existential questions about what it all means By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  June 29 2004 Stop the world Spider-Man wants to get off The exasperating double life the repression of his eternal flame for Mary Jane the tights -- it all has to come to an end. He has to be free to be Peter Parker college kid science enthusiast amateur photographer./pgt;So halfway into Sam Raimis exuberant ""Spider-Man 2"" Peter (Tobey Maguire) has tossed that trademark blue and red costume complete with mask into the garbage. Hes going to take his studies seriously and make a real effort to tell the betrothed Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) he loves her -- things he cant do when hes running all over New York City fighting crime.The first hour of Raimis first installment which came out in 2001 was a valentine to anyone whod ever read the Marvel comic or been an unpopular 17-year-old boy. When the bite of a radioactive arachnid gave him superpowers his first impulse was not to save the world but to impress Mary Jane. But somewhere in the middle Willem Dafoe appeared as the Green Goblin and the movie fell into the quicksand of saving distressed damsels.This sequel is a more complete not to mention more complex experience. Most of the time its better too. For one thing the vil- lain Alfred Molinas mad scientist -- Otto Octavius who becomes Dr. Octopus -- has four mechanical tentacles and feels no need to hide himself behind a pesky mask. But more important Raimi seems more comfortable being his outlandishly jokey B-movie self letting entire sequences play on the line between carefree schlock and Hollywood blockbusting. The escape of Dr. Octopus from an operating table is a ripsnorting piece of retro splatter-trash.But the movies soul belongs to Peter and his existential doubt about whether Dr. Octopus -- let alone garden-variety muggers and purse snatchers -- is worth fighting. Suddenly hes falling off the sides of buildings instead of scurrying up them. His senses dont tingle the way they should and he cant shoot a web from his wrists to save his own life let alone anybody elses. Sounds like a nasty case of Spiders block. His identity crisis is a superhero rite of passage. In their own movies Batman and Superman have flirted with the idea of hanging up their capes. The whole secrecy of this Spider-Man business comes at too high a practical and emotional price. So rather than out himself to anyone he quits. The movie is at its best in depicting Peters self-doubting misery without wallowing in it. Of course these pleasures cant last forever Once Dr. Octopus has kidnapped Mary Jane the comic-book formula leads back toward action complete with obligatory showdown.Alvin Sargent wrote the screenplay for ""Spider-Man 2"" but the novelist Michael Chabon is credited with making some contributions to the story. And Peter Parkers struggle with the morality of being a superhero is grounded soundly in the sort of personal but accessible angst of the young men whom Chabon dreamed up in ""The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay."" Peters friends have embarked on their brilliant careers -- Mary Jane is a stage actress and model; his pal Harry (James Franco) is running his late fathers technology company which is funding Otto Octaviuss breakthroughs in fusion. Poor Peter meanwhile is a flop at everything from his pizza-delivery job and his classes at Empire State University to getting to Mary Janes Broadway show on time. Hes behind in the rent for his cave of an apartment. To make ends meet he has to exploit himself chiefly by snapping pictures of Spider-Man to sell to the amusingly gonzo Daily Bugle editor J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons). And the superhero stuff is a job whose very social necessity robs it of its glamour and chic -- like schoolteaching and trash collection.Dr. Octopus is more necessary than he is exciting. Molina is good in the part keeping the hammy villain stuff to a minimum. He always seems kind of sad doing mundane stuff such as robbing a bank and snatching Aunt May (Rosemary Harris). Molina is a sideshow here and he knows it. The menacing archfoe is the only means the movie has to rid Peter of his demoralization and restore his sense of greatness.The stern talking-tos from the fed-up Mary Jane and stormy Harry (who has no idea his father was the Green Goblin and hates Spider-Man for killing him) dont help. If ever there were an actor built to handle the sniping its Maguire whose boyishness has a real urgency here. Seeming forever 18 has never suited him better. Theres a Hall of Fame encounter involving Spider-Man a speeding train and its passengers that seems more like a job for Superman -- but Maguire is up to the task. Beneath all the ennui and indecisiveness beats the heart of a young man of steel.Spider-Man 2Directed by Sam Raimi.

Tobey Maguires Peter Parker is a bit of a head-case in the early scenes of Spider-Man 2. Columbia Pictures Like 2002s original this is an uncommonly entertaining movie for one whose principals near-morbid hang-ups are as messy as Spideys projectile goo. And when a web-spinning spinoff ends up being even better than its predecessor its potential box office has -- to steal a claim from the films villain -- the power of the sun in the palm of its hand. Dr. Otto Octavius (a super Alfred Molina) makes that declaration about the energy stockpile he has at his disposal. And by the time it goes haywire and kills his wife just for starters New York City needs sun-screen protection ""Number Infinity."" Enter brooding Peter Parker/Spider-Man again perfectly played by Tobey Maguire. Overworked Peter is still working out problems with sad-eyed Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst). He fails to catch her Broadway triumph (yes shes an actress now) in The Importance of Being Earnest. So defeated she elects to wed an astronaut who has ""played football on the moon."" Though for all the wondrous aerial trajectories runaway trains and reptilian ""Doc Ock"" tentacles the movie offers this nonentity might as well be punching a time clock. Director Sam Raimi is back working a screenplay by Tony veteran Alvin Sargent (Julia and Ordinary People). They expertly modulate the action by juggling personal introspection (from Peter Mary Jane and James Francos now on-the-sauce Harry Osborn) no introspection (from J.K. Simmons still funny daily-rag editor) and showstoppers that include an airborne doozy with Rosemary Harris Aunt May. Just a month ago the special effects in The Day After Tomorrow seemed like an Oscar lock yet Spider-Man 2s marathon skyscraper ping-pong is just as dazzling. Moreover Spider-Mans sturdy script knows just when and how much to call on the dazzling effects -- ultimately humiliating the comparably overblown and destined-for-obscurity Tomorrow and Van Helsing. How great it is to see that even in a summer blockbuster someone has remembered the importance of being good. (Opens midnight tonight in select cities and worldwide Wednesday.

"Mano a mano - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Spider-man 2 (movie)MOVIE REVIEW Mano a manoSpider-Man finally meets a villain who merits our attention and the sequel takes flight with Alfred Molinas Doc Ock.June 29 2004|Kenneth Turan | Times Staff Writer Romance and empathy are all very nice but comic-book movies cry out for exceptional villains and ""Spider-Man 2"" has come up with a memorable one.In bringing to vivid and extravagant life Dr. Otto Octavius the ever-menacing Doc Ock Spider-Mans nemesis since the comics earliest days this energetic sequel has taken the scenario that made the first film successful and turned it inside out.The Green Goblin the bad guy the last time around is almost universally conceded to have been that films weakest element. Instead the original prospered on the pleasure of seeing a young Spider-Man learning to use his powers as well as the on-screen chemistry between stars Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst as Peter Parker Spider-Mans alter ego and Mary Jane Watson the girl next door but just out of reach.Though that relationship remains satisfying it has been greatly overshadowed by Doc Ock. As played by Alfred Molina with both computer-generated and puppeteer assistance Doc Ock grabs this film with his quartet of sinisterly serpentine mechanical arms and refuses to let go.This unintentionally different focus renders ""Spider-Man 2"" at least equal if not better than the first in overall impact. There are times when it feels like its cruising but it rewards our attention by successfully firing on more and different cylinders than the original did.It helps that not just Maguire and Dunst are back from the first film but also Rosemary Harris as kindly Aunt May J.K. Simmons as dyspeptic newspaper editor J. Jonah Jameson and James Franco as Harry Osborn Peters best friend and Spider-Mans deadliest enemy.Also returning is director Sam Raimi this time assisted by a quartet of credited writers. The films screenplay is by two-time Oscar winner Alvin Sargent with screen story by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar best known for TVs ""Smallville"" and novelist Michael Chabon author of ""The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier amp; Clay.""Despite the best efforts of this group the early parts of ""Spider-Man 2"" cant have the emotional impact of the first film because it is in effect a reprise of that initial venture. Though Maguire and Dunst are sweet together their early interaction feels lethargic and pro-forma like they read and believed their good notices. Plus its just not possible to experience the glow of first love twice.Plot-wise Peter Parker is still pining away for M.J. whose face is all over Manhattan as the poster girl for a fancy perfume. And he is still fuming that being a responsible Spider-Man has wreaked havoc with his personal life i.e. he doesnt have one.Though it is still a major treat to see Spider-Man take to the air what is as hard to duplicate as first love is the first films thrill of learning to fly.""Spider-Man 2"" tries to replace it with Parkers crisis of confidence as the young man wonders if being Spider-Man is worth it.Not lacking in confidence at all is that celebrated scientist Dr. Octavius initially a heck of a nice guy albeit one focused on his forthcoming attempt to use four mechanical arms to harness a fusion reaction and create a perpetual energy source.But something (doesnt it always) goes terribly wrong and those 13-foot mechanical arms not only fuse to the doctors body which would be bad enough they also take over his mind with their evil evil thoughts. Oh the horror of it all.Though the original Doc Ock was conceptualized by comic artist Steve Ditko the filmmakers have done a spectacular job of making him real on screen. It started with vivid illustrations by conceptual artist Paul Catling (reproduced in a making-of book called ""Caught in the Web"") and ended with the Doc having his own personal art director Jeff Knipp working with visual effects designer John Dykstra and cinematographer Bill Pope.Computer work by Sony Pictures Imageworks and several other firms made the Doc chillingly mobile able to climb tall buildings like a larger more ungainly but powerfully effective spider. Best of all was the animatronic work by Edge FX puppeteers which give those metallic arms with tentacle heads that swirl around Doc Ocks head like snakes around Medusa very unnerving personalities.All told Doc Ock is such a completely realized creation the battles he has with Spider-Man are so involving he actually helps buck up the rest of the production. Even the romantic moments between Parker and M.J. become more poignant and moving as the menace of the Doc looms. Its not that we want the villains to actually win but if they arent worthy opponents just what is the heros victory good for?Spider-Man 2MPAA rating PG-13 for stylized action-violenceTimes guidelines Violence in some scenes may be too intense for young children.Tobey Maguire...Peter Parker/Spider-ManKirsten Dunst...Mary Jane WatsonAlfred Molina...Dr. Otto OctaviusJames Franco...Harry OsbornRosemary Harris...Aunt MayDonna Murphy...Rosalie OctaviusJ.K.

"Spider-Man 2 leaps off screen - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Spider-Man 2 leaps off screenJuly 02 2004|By Mark Caro Tribune movie reporter.""Spider-Man 2"" gives comic-book movies sequels and summer popcorn flicks a good name. Until it develops a case of verbal diarrhea toward the end it improves upon its predecessor in almost every way delivering flashier thrills while digging deeper into its characters and adding an overlay of wit.""Spider-Man 2"" cant offer the surprise of discovery but it turns out to be a richer story with a sharper focus on Peters inability to reconcile his heroic alter ego with his everyday identity Spider-Mans constant crime-fighting renders Peter perpetually late and unreliable. Peter (Tobey Maguire) also feels he cant proclaim his love for Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) for fear of endangering her if his identity is ever discovered.Peters split personality is your basic superhero dilemma but its handled with such sympathy and smarts that it becomes universal Comic-book characters arent the only ones who suffer for trying to lead a secret life. With Maguire and Dunst you feel the full force of these emotions.Spider-Mans nemesis this time is a scientist named Dr. Otto Octavius (a pleasingly complex Alfred Molina) whose botched science experiment leaves him with four ""smart arms"" fused to his body. Although Doc Ock lacks the legendary Spider-Man pedigree of the Green Goblin he turns out to be the more compelling villain.Working from a character-rich screenplay by Alvin Sargent director Sam Raimi returns with a surer sense of tone and greater ability to integrate the character drama with impressive set pieces. Yes Spider-Man still looks cartoonish as he swings from building to building but the lack of realism plays like a valid stylistic choice; the action scenes boast an undeniable exuberance.Although this superhero overstays his welcome by the end you can forgive him because in ""Spider-Man 2"" hes flying high.----------""Spider-Man 2"" (star)(star)(star)1/2 is playing at area theaters.

Its dangerous for his beloved Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) to know hes Spider-Man so he has to keep his true agonized self distant from her yearning heart. Every once in a while this affects his superheroic night job he loses the ability to spin the sticky webs that permit him boinging passage through the New York City skies and -- splat ouch -- he tumbles to the concrete. Is this any way to manage a franchise film? You bet it is. Written primarily by Alvin Sargent (who the credits indicate had a lot of help) and directed by Sam Raimi with his heart on his sleeve and his tongue in his cheek Spider-Man 2 is 1) a sequel thats much better than the original movie and 2) probably the best special-effects extravaganza since Raiders of the Lost Ark. This is because the effects though handsomely managed dont overwhelm the story and characters. The latter include a soulful scientist (Alfred Molina) who having fooled with Mother Nature is somehow transformed into a great clanking mechanical octopus; back from Spidey I Peters spunky sweet-spirited aunt (the divine Rosemary Harris); and the meanest newspaper managing editor in movie history (J.K. Simmons). Occasionally a street singer shows up to croak awful ballads about Spideys exploits and poor Auntie cant even get a toaster premium much less a desperately needed loan from her bank. Thats the thing about this movie. It takes the time -- all right sometimes too much time -- to meander up paths that are not strictly germane to its main narrative. But mostly that pays off -- in funny tossed-off lines and quirky situations and a nice warm glow at the end. Were not dealing with Jamesian complexity here. But we do have something almost as rare to contemplate a big Hollywood machine thats unexpectedly full of wit and -- dare we say it? -- intelligence.

"Spider-Man 2 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; spider-man-2 ) Spider-Man 2 (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli Spider-Man 2 has all the elements of a good but not great superhero motion picture. While lacking the tragic grandeur that made last years Hulk such a unique experience Spider-Man 2 fills the void with solid character development self-referential humor effects-enhanced action and (unfortunately) talky pop psychology. A worthy sequel to the 2002 blockbuster Spider-Man 2 will deposit fans somewhere on the satisfaction spectrum between quietly pleased and overjoyed. Although not as economical with its scenes as the first Spider-Man this film nevertheless advances the leftover threads from its predecessor tells its own self-contained tale and dangles enough bait to hint at where Spider-Man 3 will be heading. The movie - at least the first half - is a little light on action and heavy on talk. This is not an inherently bad thing except that a lot of the dialogue relates to Peter Parkers soul-searching should he sacrifice his inner desires for the greater good of mankind (cue his dead uncles pronouncement ""With great power comes great responsibility"") or give up crime fighting to become an ordinary guy pursue his dreams and get the girl. This material would work better if it wasnt re-hashing ground that was effectively covered in the first film. Although its useful for character-building theres a little too much of it and it threatens to bog down the proceedings. Fortunately the second hour which contains all three major action sequences is better paced leading to a rousing climax that works on multiple emotional levels. There are a trio of endings all of which satisfy in their own ways. Spider-Man 2 picks up a couple of years after the conclusion of the original Spider-Man. By this time the costumed alter-ego of geeky Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) has become a New York City legend. Despite being decried by the Daily Bugle as a ""menace"" Spidey (as he is affectionately known) is as big a hero to some as he is a villain to others. In staying true to his calling as a crime fighter Peter must stay away from the girl of his dreams. Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) loves Peter and Peter loves her but he can never let her know because hes afraid his enemies would use that information against them. So he pines in silence and she becomes engaged an astronaut. Meanwhile a brilliant physicist named Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) who is working for Peters best friend Harry Osborne (James Franco) has mastered a way to generate a controlled fusion reaction that can provide enough energy to fuel an entire city. Using mechanical arms grafted into his spinal column he begins to manipulate the mini-sun he creates but things go disastrously wrong. When the dust has settled Dock Ock is no longer the man he was - hes insane and obsessed and determined to rid Manhattan of Spider-Man. But like Clark Kent in Superman 2 Peter has decided to abandon his powers so he can love a woman - and just at the time when the world most needs him. One could argue that Spider-Mans most compelling and dangerous comic book adversary is Doctor Octopus and Alfred Molina develops the villain into something more than just another mad genius. Hes certainly more intimidating than Willem Dafoes Green Goblin. With his four mechanical arms (to go along with two natural arms and two legs) Doc Ock matches (or exceeds) Spidey when it comes to brains brawn and reflexes. Stripped of a conscience and set adrift in a current of amorality Octavius represents one of the most dangerous screen interpretations of a comic book bad guy to date. And Molina finds the right balance between being too low-key and chewing on the scenery. Tobey Maguire is back as the web-crawler and Kirsten Dunst makes her second appearance as his One True Love. James Franco shows a marked improvement in his acting as the conflicted Harry whose desire to fill his fathers shoes is matched only by his hatred of Spider-Man. The return of so many familiar faces (including Cliff Robertson as Uncle Ben and Dafoe as the Goblin in cameos) assures a strong sense of continuity with the first film. If theres an acting standout however its not any of the major players. Instead its J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson the publisher of the Daily Bugle. Simmons was one of Spider-Mans small pleasures. Here in an expanded role he dominates every scene hes in with his perfect timing and his drill sergeant-like delivery of dialogue. Simmons not only embodies the Jameson from the comic books he enhances the character. Spider-Man 2 is essentially three movies rolled into one a traditional superhero story a coming-of-age tale and a romance. The third element which is likely to find more favor with 13-year old girls than with 13-year old boys isnt just an extraneous element. Its crucial to the development of both the plot and the characters and it is better resolved than in the first film. Then theres the humor. One of Spider-Man 2s strengths is that it doesnt fear occasionally lightening up. So we get a lady singing the theme song from the animated ""Spider-Man"" TV series (""Spider-Man Spider-Man does whatever a spider cana|"") Spidey taking an elevator and complaining that his costume is too tight in the crotch Bruce Campbell playing a snooty usher and Peter Parker displaying an aghast expression when learning that Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) gave away his comic book collection. The special effects are on the whole a little less successful than in the previous outing - probably because there are more of them. At times especially during some of the complex battle maneuvers or when hes slinging his way high above Manhattan its pretty obvious that Spider-Man is computer generated. The key to CGI is not to overuse the technique. Spider-Man flirted with the line. Spider-Man 2 crosses it although barely and not in a way that it becomes a serious detriment. And there are some marvelous scenes such as when Spider-Man tries to stop an out-of-control train or when Peter Parker leaps atop Mary Jane to keep her from harms way. (That may be the most impressive sequence in the entire movie and its in the trailers.) Spider-Man 2 is about 20 minutes too long. Although Sam Raimis direction is generally solid (and in some scenes flawless) the films middle act has instances when it seems repetitive and exposition-heavy. The strength of the climax and denouement almost renders such concerns moot but they cannot be completely dismissed since they prevent this film from ascending to the pinnacle of superhero movies. Nevertheless even though it does not eclipse Superman Hulk or even X-Men 2 Spider-Man 2 proves that this series has plenty of juice left. As long as this creative team remains in place I look forward to more adventures with my friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.

The pleasure is doubled in ""Spider-Man 2."" Crackerjack entertainment from start to finish this rousing yarn about a reluctant superhero and his equally conflicted friends and enemies improves in every way on its predecessor and is arguably about as good a live-action picture as anyones ever made using comicbook characters. The 2002 original grossed 822 million worldwide in theatrical release -- 404 million of that domestically -- and theres no reason to believe this one wont generate that much and more. In one of those occasional examples of sequelmakers setting their sights higher the second time around and mostly hitting the mark director Sam Raimi producers Laura Ziskin and Avi Arad amp; Co. rather than equating bigger with better have conscientiously applied themselves to improving all aspects of the franchise. Conspicuously the action sequences are more exciting the visual effects -- particularly Spider-Mans swings through the canyons of Manhattan -- are far more natural and compelling and even Danny Elfmans score is improved. Most importantly however the script provides a depth and dramatic balance quite rare in this sort of fare. Alvin Sargent a distinguished vet screenwriter best known for such estimable character-driven fare as ""Paper Moon"" ""Julia"" ""Ordinary People"" and ""Unfaithful"" did uncredited rewrites on the first ""Spider-Man."" Here working from a story devised by Alfred Gough Miles Millar and Michael Chabon he makes at least five characters into tortured souls with momentous decisions to make and places them all in a narrative frame within which the related elements are adroitly proportioned. Result is an object lesson in how even for this sort of fare the script can very much be the thing. Unlike the last round of ""Batman"" films which got sillier with each installment ""Spider-Man"" is on the upswing an impression fostered even by the opening credits which resemble the comicbook style of those in the original but incorporate arresting renderings of key scenes to recapitulate the first pictures story. At the outset Spider-Man is on a sort of hiatus taking a back seat to the bumbling efforts of Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) to juggle his studies at Columbia with part-time gigs taking pictures for the tabloid Daily Bugle and delivering pizzas on a strict schedule which even Spideys best web-swinging cant manage successfully. Opening section quickly pulls the viewer close to Peter by sympathetically and amusingly detailing the difficulties of his struggle to make ends meet in a tough city. Hes constantly reminded of his inexpressible feelings for Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) whose face on a perfume campaign is plastered all over the city and whos enjoying success onstage in a revival of ""The Importance of Being Earnest."" Driven by a deep need to succeed where his father Norman failed and still tormented over his death Harry Osborn (James Franco) has invested heavily in the research of scientific genius Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) who believes hes on the verge of creating a source of perpetual energy through sustained fusion. As the altruistic Octavius tells the admiring Peter who intends to write his thesis on him this breakthrough will put ""the power of the sun in the palm of my hand."" But just as Norman Osborns experiment turned him into a demented villain so does Octavius; in front of numerous onlookers his electrical gizmos bust a gut and his four enormous metal ""activators"" turn into murderous tentacles of staggering speed and strength and capable of transporting the creature soon to be dubbed Dr. Octopus or Doc Ock up and down walls with ease. Even here however there is internal tension. Octavius is dreadfully aware of the tragic implications of his transformation as the evil-minded tentacles assume control over his mind rendering him powerless to halt their rampage. He is therefore an arch-villain in violent disagreement with the mantle hes suddenly inherited. To some perhaps this will make Doc Ock less than the ideal bad guy but to others it could make him more interesting than the standard-issue doomdealer. Spider-Mans first spectacular battle with Doc Ock takes place in and on a bank the latter has decided to rob; for hardly the last time Spidey is sent plunging from high off a building only to save himself at the last second. Upping the stakes is Doc Ocks having turned Peters beloved Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) into an unlikely Harold Lloyd dangling the poor woman off a skyscraper by her umbrella. The new verisimilitude with which the visual effects are executed gives this sequence as well as others a special thrill. But for Peter Parker unlike the audience the thrill is gone. Crushed when he realizes his own reticence has induced a frustrated Mary Jane to become engaged to another man astronaut John Jameson (Daniel Gillies) son of Daily Bugle editor J. Jonah Jameson (the ever-punchy J.K. Simmons) Peter finds his superpowers occasionally failing him. This subconscious manifestation of his misgivings about fully assuming the responsibilities of societys savior provides a dramatic act-one climax as at the storys precise midway point Peter tosses his Spider-Man costume in the trash. A light-hearted interlude cheekily accompanied by ""Raindrops Keep Fallin on My Head"" illustrates the more balanced and happier young man Peter is able to become without the specter of Spider-Man constantly hovering over him; he hopes his fresh approach to life will win Mary Jane over before its too late and in the bargain confesses to Aunt May his guilt for his part in the death of Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson seen in one quasi-dream sequence). But Peters good deeds on a strictly interpersonal level cant compete with the life-saving contributions he can make as Spider-Man. The Bugle blares that in Spideys absence crime has risen 75% and when the now-alcoholic Harry agrees to provide Doc Ock with the ingredient he needs to complete repairs on his fusion machine in exchange for Spider-Man on a platter the stage is set for a renewed showdown. Most elaborate -- and geographically the goofiest -- set piece takes place when Manhattan is suddenly transformed into downtown Chicago to enable Spider-Man and Doc Ock to fight it out on an elevated train. Once this considerable poetic license is swallowed scene is a doozy as Spidey eludes a barrage of tentacled probings before struggling to slow down the runaway train by flinging webs onto nearby buildings. In the process Spider-Man is unmasked to the public the beginning of an unveiling that will have private implications as well. In an equally nifty intimate scene Mary Jane puts her own feelings to the test by repeating her unforgettable upside-down kiss of Spider-Man on her fiance the result of which will determine her destiny henceforth. The action climax which could have ended the picture in a routine way is followed by a satisfying emotional exchange between Peter and Mary Jane as well as by a strong setting-up of the presumed central conflict for the next installment in the series. The new emotional levels and increased opportunities provided by the script give the actors a chance to stretch and they all respond none more than Maguire. Running the gamut from heroic knight to heartbroken suitor thesp is a constant delight his lightness of touch providing many grace notes to what was already a lively characterization. Dunst gets more screentime than before and fleshes out the damsel-in-distress aspects of her part with a nice portrait of a young woman trying to figure out where her future lies. With Aunt May finally after two years of mourning trying to move on Harris has much more to do and does it with her customary excellence and Franco pushes Harry into an unanticipated dark realm. Molinas initial geniality morphs into a determined but unmaniacal evil although the lack of a specific focus for his destructiveness makes Doc Ock real purpose a bit fuzzy. Raimis direction is more assured than before and often downright stylish with Bill Popes lustrous lensing combining on a finished picture that provides constant visual delight. With the speeded-up herky-jerkiness gone the effects now are all but perfect and numerous point-of-view shots add to the pop of the web-flinging. Bob Murawskis editing is very tight and at six minutes even the end credits are shorter than the norm for this kind of crew-heavy picture.
