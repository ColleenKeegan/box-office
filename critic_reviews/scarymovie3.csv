Franchise is now in the directorial hands of David Zucker who kick-started its umpteen-gags-per-hour parody ilk with ""Airplane"" in 1980. Feature should benefit from the continued boom market for mainstream horror pics in coining strong short-term returns at the B.O. Ditto longer-term home format biz. A correction was made to this review on Oct. 24 2003 The Wayans are gone but the laughs are back (well somewhat) as ""Scary Movie 3"" improves upon part deuxs soph slump. Still falling well short of the originals inspired (if spotty) hilarity franchise is now in the directorial hands of David Zucker who kick-started its umpteen-gags-per-hour parody ilk with ""Airplane"" in prehistoric 1980. Feature should benefit from the continued boom market for mainstream horror pics (most recently ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" which duly gets a nod here) in coining strong short-term returns at the B.O. Ditto longer-term home format biz. For reasons best known to Miramax/Dimension brass series co-creators Keenan Marlon and Shawn Wayans are now out of the picture. While latter duos screen characters (terminal pothead Shorty and horndogging closet case Ray respectively) are missed a bit the tapped-out scatological humor of ""2"" is not. Though far from a paragon of good taste latest entry does for the most part realize that a good joke cant live on body parts functions and fluids alone. That said results here are just middling funny with no truly memorable high points and a sum impact that goes poof before youve left the parking garage. Anna Faris and Regina Hall are lone returnees bearing the same character names but otherwise providing no narrative connection to ""Scary"" 1 amp; 2. Opening scenes make it clear what the primary reference points will be First career cover girls Pamela Anderson and Jenny McCarthy -as busty Catholic schoolgirl nitwits -suffer the ""Ring"" fate during a sleepover. Then pic switches to cornfields where farmer Tom (Charlie Sheen of former Zucker partner Jim Abrahams ""Hot Shots"" pics) and aspiring rapper brother George (Simon Rex) reenact the alien-invasion scenario of ""Signs."" Cindy (Faris blonde again after her scene stealing ""Lost in Translation"" ditz) is now a local TV news anchor raising orphaned nephew Cody (Drew Mikuska). Shes soon on the trail of both the killer ""Ring"" video and UFO rumors -- as well as on the tail of cute George whose niece Sue (Jianna Ballard) has the same schoolteacher (Halls Brenda) as Cody. Brenda is soon a casualty. So is a labored sequence at her wake which endures much well-intended indignity at the hands of George his vaguely lovesick manager Mahalik (Anthony Anderson) and hanger-on C.J. (Kevin Hart). As the various phenomena are investigated the President (frequent Zucker muse Leslie Nielsen) becomes involved. All principals end up back at the farm for an OK climax wherein the secret link between mysterious E.T.s and the straggle-haired video-death chick is sussed out. Occupying midpic reels in Craig Mazin and Pat Profts script are a succession of gags parodying other films (notably the ""Matrix"" ones with Queen Latifah Eddie Griffin and George Carlin standing in for Ruby Dee Laurence Fishburne and Helmut Bataikus) as well as general pop-culture targets. Variably less inspired are set pieces revolving around such familiar punching bags as pederastic priests (though ""Saturday Night Lives"" Darrell Hammond handles that one nicely) and Michael Jackson (impersonator not credited). At times Zucker doesnt seem interested in sticking to the horror genre which is something the first two ""Movies"" were clearer about. His flair for punishing slapstick physicality is a compensation though the amount of reckless child endangerment here (Cody is a particular abuse-magnet) stops being funny and turns a little creepy around the half-way point. Casting reps a sometimes crass attempt to hang onto the series appeal for African-American audiences. Some placements (""8 Mile"" and ""Matrix"" segs Anderson and Harts solid turns) are justified while others (like D.L. Hughley and Ja Rule as presidential aides) make so little use of the talent as to seem merely opportunist. Worst in that respect is en masse appearance of Master P Macy Gray Redman and other music stars who no sooner show up than they shoot each other dead. Other celebs thrown into the mix for recognition value include Denise Richards ""American Idols"" Simon Cowell and ""Coors Twins"" the Klimaszewskis. Leads Faris and Rex have their moments while Sheen pretty much plays straight man. Camryn Mannheims role as a rural cop must have justified her fourth billing in some earlier edit. For better or worse pics tenor and production style recall Zuckers prior yokfests far more than the first ""Scarys."" All design/tech contribs are professionally slick. A note advising ""We are about halfway through this thing"" is posted amidst closing credits so long they allow for another four or five hip-hop tracks to be sandwiched onto the soundtrack.

The first ""Scary Movie"" was of course a slashing burlesque of ""Scream."" In the years since however Hollywood fright flicks have gone back to taking themselves very very seriously and so Scary Movie 3 with somber thrillers like ""Signs"" ""The Ring"" and ""The Others"" in its sights has if anything a richer fatter series of targets than its forebears. There is for instance a spooky-eyed telepathic kid whos a takeoff on Haley Joel Osment and all of the other spooky-eyed telepaths who have followed in his cutely ghoulish wake. The casting alone is hilarious - the young actor Drew Mikuska has a face so knowing so fraught with mystical worry that he looks like he could be a bobblehead doll in an occult bookstore. His predictions are all disasters delivered with smart-alecky one-upmanship (""Smile all you want - youre going to be hit by a bus"") but then comes the Zucker touch The kid himself gets hit by cars smashed by mallets - in other words he gets exactly what he deserves. Thats comedy with a healthy kick of vengeance. Like its two predecessors ""Scary Movie 3"" is a hit-or-miss affair but the gags that connect really connect. Im thinking of moments like Charlie Sheen as the forlorn Mel Gibson farmer rushing to close his dying wifes eyes as she attempts to extract from him a lifetime vow of celibacy; Anna Faris whos like Britney Spears with self-mockery talking to the mysterious phone caller from ""The Ring"" about whether thats seven business days until you die; the ungodly havoc wreaked upon a corpse at a wake; home videos of ""terrifying"" aliens that look like ""Jackass"" outtakes invaded by a rubber-headed theme-restaurant mascot; and Sheen having been whacked in the crotch with a wooden beam screaming ""My balls"" and then - with that impeccable Zuckerian vaudeville timing - being handed a pair of bowling balls. Thats a joke so perfectly terrible you have to laugh. Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

Pam Anderson plays a pal of Jenny McCarthys in Scary Movie 3. Its also a movie in which Pamela Anderson parading her cleavage in Cinerama and 24-track stereo plays a pal of Jenny McCarthys. (Related itemSee a clip from the film) And a movie in which Leslie Nielsen plays the president. All this naturally leads to Scary Movie3 a sequel funnier than its predecessors because it has the director/co-writer the series should have employed all along. Hes David Zucker whos just coming off one of the years worst debacles (My Bosss Daughter) but is born to this franchise. Zucker was after all a key player on 1980s Airplane which has led to 23 years of hit-and-miss comedies designed to cannibalize Hollywood hits and hoary cliches. This one is slightly more ""hit."" More about the movie Scary Movie 3 (  stars) Stars Anna Faris Charlie Sheen Leslie Nielsen Anthony Anderson Queen Latifah Director David Zucker Distributor Dimension Rating PG-13 for pervasive crude and sexual humor language comic violence and drug references Opens today nationwide Soon to be sporting the reddest ears around is writer/director M. Night Shyamalan whose The Sixth Sense and Signs come in for especially severe drubbing. We start with the fact that Charlie Sheen stands in for Signs Mel Gibson. When the expected crop circles appear Sheens younger brother skedaddles from the farm in hopes of becoming the new Eminem. Later in a flashback Sheens Mrs. (real-life wife Denise Richards) dishes him dirt even as shes dying from effects of automobile metal cutting her in half. And Jackson (or Edward Moss in dead-ringer Michael makeup) briefly shows up to enable Zucker amp; Co. to get in a good-and-grisly nose joke. Meanwhile Anderson and McCarthy have watched a supernatural VHS right out of The Ring a mayhem-maker that gets blond TV reporter Anna Faris (reprising her Scary 1 and 2 Cindy Campbell brunette role) to investigate. Faris has some of the breathy/wispy quality Julie Hagerty brought to Airplane and shes a major asset here. Jeremy Piven anchoring the news may have the films single funniest scene when a custodian wreaks havoc with the teleprompter. Gags designed to be in the worst taste turn out to be the least funny -- so when they bomb they really leave a stench. Compensating is a funny bit with Eddie Griffin and Queen Latifah (Mrs. Psychic at Home) and 77-year-old Nielsen in the Oval Office. Nielsen and his fellow performers find some of his jokes left hanging -- though in truth there were far more hanging chads in the last election. The time might be right for the Scary movies to quit on top even though alas there are no term limits for sequels.

The film by ... more Photo HO Scary 3 falls short in ha-ha and aaahh 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Scary Movie 3 Comedy. Starring Charlie Sheen Anna Faris Leslie Nielsen and Simon Rex. Directed by David Zucker. (Rated R. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The list of actors in ""Scary Movie 3"" is long and at first the variety of roles looks promising. Along with the usual array of celebrity guests portraying themselves actors were hired to play (in order of appearance) Catholic Schoolgirl 2 Toilet Guy Tracheotomy Man and Tracheotomy Mans Wife. But despite the impressive breadth of bodily function jokes gaping cleavage and other tasteless spectacle and despite help from one of the creators of ""Airplane"" this years addition to the popular horror-spoof series isnt very funny. The first and second entries in the ""Scary Movie"" series were Wayans- infused affairs with Keenen Ivory directing and Shawn and Marlon in starring roles as they sent up movies such as ""Scream"" and ""The Sixth Sense."" The responsibility this time is passed to David Zucker who co-directed the 1980 hit ""Airplane"" and two of the ""Naked Gun"" movies. ""Scary Movie 3"" once again follows newscaster Cindy (Anna Faris) through a virtually plot-free journey that focuses heavily on events in ""The Ring"" ""Signs"" and a few other 2001 and 2002 movies that have long since gone to DVD. After the first few minutes viewers will get the feeling they just emerged from a 14-month coma. Even the non-movie jokes focus on last years news including Michael Jacksons nose pedophile priests and ""American Idol."" By the time the twins from the Coors commercial show up youll realize you could have saved 8.50 stayed home and read old Mad magazines. ""Airplane"" co-director Jerry Zucker (Davids brother) went on to direct painfully serious movies starring Patrick Swayze (""Ghost"") and Richard Gere (""First Knight"") and he probably had the better idea. The art of lampooning has developed dramatically since the Zuckers made their best movies with Jon Abrahams in the 1980s and the comedy formulas that were so popular 20 years ago seem out of date with the expansion of cable television. When the makers of ""South Park"" can riff off world events two weeks after they happen and Jon Stewarts ""The Daily Show"" produces biting humor the same day how is a scene spoofing the 2001 movie ""The Others"" supposed to compete? ""Scary Movie 3"" deadlines were too tight for a Don Zimmer throw-down or a white tiger mauling (presumably those will be seen in ""Scary Movie 4"" already in preproduction). As a result the film relies heavily on the old standards -- bodily functions and racial stereotypes -- and the results are mixed. Zucker may have earned a lot of laughs by including jive-talking African American characters in ""Airplane"" but the world has since changed for the better. Worse than simply being prejudiced much of the humor coming out of characters mouths in ""Scary Movie 3"" is also recycled. (Example ""Ive got this feeling something bads going to happen to me -- like when you see an Asian behind the wheel of a car."") Considering the amount of time he spent lambasting the comparatively educational ""Barbershop"" Jesse Jackson better go on a David-Blaine-in-a-box 44-day hunger strike over the scene in ""SM3"" in which a smirking priest comes over to baby-sit Cindys kindergarten-age nephew. That promising young actor is later hit by a car and repeatedly beaten with a baseball bat. Faring better over time is the flatulence and excrement humor. Both major vomit jokes hit their mark (without giving too much away the best one involves Toilet Guy) and an extended horse defecation scene is as well timed as it is unappetizing. Most moviegoers will recognize at least 20 actors in ""Scary Movie 3"" and their comic abilities are mixed. Charlie Sheen classes up the joint with his deadpan humor Alameda native Simon Rex contributes a decent Eminem imitation and Jeremy Piven does a great job as a newscaster who needs to be weaned off his TelePrompTer. Faris by contrast doesnt have a single entertaining line despite being in the movie more than anyone else. ""Naked Gun"" star Leslie Nielsen who hasnt been funny since 1991 keeps his streak intact. And one can only hope that the rappers who showed up on the set just to blow each other away with handguns (see racial stereotypes above) arent walking around with Screen Actors Guild cards because of it. There are a few laughs in ""Scary Movie 3"" but most of the content is hopelessly dated. And thats the kind of problem that all the Toilet Guys in the world cant fix. - This film contains violence profanity and sexual situations.

"Scary Movie 3 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; scary-movie-3 ) Scary Movie 3 (United States 2003) A movie review by James Berardinelli When the filmmakers started out two films ago the Scary Movies were funny. Since then it has been a rapid decline through mediocrity into near-unwatchability. Absent for this third installment are the Wayans Brothers who are replaced by David Zucker and his scribe-for-hire Pat Proft. If theres one thing this motion picture proves its that The Naked Gun 33 1/3 wasnt the final insult from a founding ZAZ (Zucker/Abrams/Zucker) member; this is. Only two weeks after foisting their last greed-impelled cinematic atrocity upon us (a drawn-and-quartered Kill Bill) Miramax (a.k.a. Dimension) is at it again. Theres only one reason Scary Movie 3 exists and it has nothing to do with creativity comedy or the need to give Charlie Sheen a job. These movies are cheap to make and they are proven box office performers. Frankly the film could take in 20 million during its first week out then not earn another cent and it would still be considered a solid performer. So were doomed to endure more Scary Movies after this one. Scary thought. Two decades ago David Zucker and Pat Proft were responsible in one form or another for a pair of the funniest saturation comedies to reach the big screen Airplane and The Naked Gun. Lately they have been slumming and their tenements have gotten progressively more dilapidated with every effort. Zucker recently directed My Boss Daughter and Proft was responsible for Mr. Magoo. Not good signs. There are about three or four genuine laughs in Scary Movie 3 and a lot of failed jokes in between. Even a National League pitcher gets more hits. Once these guys were funny but they have stayed around too long and their comedy has grown more flaccid than an overcooked noodle. Theres a sense of desperation lurking just beneath the surface of this film - the desperation of men who need someone to laugh at them but have forgotten how to provoke the desired reaction. Apparently Kevin Smith was involved in the screenwriting process at one point although there doesnt seem to be anything remaining that could have come from his pen. Scary Movie 3 is an uninspired parody of three recent popular movies 8 Mile Signs and The Ring. The only relationship it has with the previous two Scary Movies is that lead actress Anna Faris is back as Cindy Campbell. This time shes dropped into the middle of a combination alien invasion/ghost story. After watching a killer video tape she has only seven days to live and in that time she has to stop a deranged ghost living in a well fall in love with a white self-doubting rapper named George (Simon Rex) and help the President (Leslie Nielsen) stymie an invasion by aliens who have a fondness for the corn field of a minister-turned-farmer (Charlie Sheen). Parodies are only funny when the barbs are pointed and on-target and those are two of the least likely adjectives to be used when describing Scary Movie 3. None of the comedy is daring (not an unusual trait for a PG-13 movie). Theres some gross-out material and various indignities are performed on a corpse but that stuff is pretty tame by todays standards. The weaving together of the primary three inspirations is done inelegantly. Zucker and Proft obviously dont care about plot; normally the viewer wouldnt either. However with so much of the humor failing it becomes increasingly obvious that theres not much of a storyline to fall back on and that makes Scary Movie 3 a colossal waste of time. Cameos abound presumably in a vain attempt to distract us from how tedious this movie is. But like the stars and the screenplay theyre second rate. Some of the biggest names are Denise Richards (playing Charlie Sheens wife) Ja Rule Camryn Manheim Pamela Anderson (looking artificial) Jenny McCarthy (looking old) Simon Cowell (hoist by his own petard) Queen Latifah and George Carlin. Carlins appearance is the most frustrating. For someone who almost always gets a laugh Carlin (playing the Matrixs architect) comes across as flat. Likewise Queen Latifah (as the Oracle) shows little spark. Of the leads Anna Faris is her usual perky self Charlie Sheen appears somewhat bewildered (maybe he couldnt believe how bad the movie is) and Simon Rex is about the unlikeliest and most unlikable love interest one is apt to find. Then theres the sad case of 77-year old Leslie Nielsen who spends his limited screen time trying to re-create the kind of comedic bumbling that became his meat-and-potatoes when he re-invigorated his career in the 80s. Now this routine is tired repetitious and devoid of energy - which is a pretty good way to describe the movie as a whole. The cast and crew of Scary Movie 3 might be able to strike the funny bone occasionally but the rhythmic thudding of the dud jokes as they miss their targets is enough to put just about anyone to sleep. This is comedy at its worst - the kind of thing that makes Saturday Night Live circa 2003 seem innovative and fresh.
