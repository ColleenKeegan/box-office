Liev Schreiber best known as the creepy Cotton Weary in Scream gives off entirely the wrong vibe in the US ambassador role to which Gregory Peck brought so much gravitas. As his wife Kathryn played by Lee Remick in the Richard Donner film the insipid Julia Stiles is far too young and way out of her depth. Likewise poor Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick who makes no impression at all as their perpetually scowling son Damien. Only David Thewlis in David Warners old role as the press photographer whose snaps seem to presage his own death survives with his credibility intact. A shameless Da Vinci Code-style prologue shows Vatican priests warning the Pope about an impending Armageddon citing the Book of Revelation and recent disasters Hurricane Katrina the Asian tsunami and 9/11. This pre-empts any ambiguity about the devilish nature of the baby Damien (Davey-Fitzpatrick) which Rome-based diplomat Robert Thorn (Schreiber) switches for the boy his wife lost in childbirth. So when Thorn is unexpectedly appointed US ambassador to Great Britain and the family move to London its no surprise when the diabolical happenings start. Theres a shocking public suicide the ominous warnings and bizarre death of Father Brennan (Pete Postlethwaite) and the mysterious appearance of ubernanny Mrs Baylock (Mia Farrow) and her fiercely protective devil dog. Nuts-and-bolts director John Moore (The Flight of the Phoenix) stages a couple of gruesome set pieces with panache but the film lacks suspense atmosphere and any hint of human emotion.Exclusive The Omen interviews here.

That Julia Stiles and Liev Schreiber cant bring the same gravitas to their roles Gregory Peck and Lee Remick in their respective portrayals seems an appropriate reflection of an age where politics seems to be populated by fresh-faced ambitious young graduates that have barely started growing facial hair. Stiles and Schreibers comparative youth is an effective conduit for the blind faith that there can be no such thing as evil incarnate - especially in their own infant child - on which the storys horror depends. Stiles performance echoed Tilda Swintons role in We Need To Talk About Kevin - a woman whose own well intentioned nature and character cannot make up for the failure to establish the maternal bond with her son that will keep him off a path to evil. She convincingly wears the strain of being unable to reconcile the expectations of those around her with her own instincts that something is deeply wrong with her child. Schreiber handles a thankless role well able to develop the blandness of his initial disbelief of the assertions being made to him through to his eventual acceptance that they were right all along and he does in fact have to murder his son. And when he introduces Mrs Baylock to the end of her role in the story I clapped my hands with a satisfaction I dont remember feeling when I watched the original. I cant say Id choose the remake over the original if I could only pick one. The relentless motifs of red against cold blue start to grate and the new Damian is no match for his predecessor who balanced both the potential for evil with the innocence of a child so chillingly. But its an effective effort for a younger generation with no awareness of the original or of the period in history that produced it. I think they have as much reason to be as appalled and fascinated by the story as I was first time round.

Comments The Omen The most commercially successful of the early Exorcist knockoffs The Omen (1976) launched its own franchise with the tale of an American diplomat and his wife (Gregory Peck and Lee Remick) whose adopted son turns out to be Satans spawn. This new version is an almost scene-for-scene remake which is good news in the first half and bad in the torpid second. As the unsuspecting parents Liev Schreiber and Julia Stiles cant fill their predecessors shoes but Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick is much creepier as little Damien and Mia Farrow is a perpetual delight as Mrs. Baylock the literal nanny from hell. John Moore (Flight of the Phoenix) directed; with David Thewlis Pete Postlethwaite and Michael Gambon. R 105 min. By J.R.

With Gael Garcia Bernal William Hurt. (105 min.)Gael Garcia Bernal plays Elvis Valderez newly discharged from the Navy who makes his way to a small Texas town and presents himself to the local pastor (Hurt) as the son he never knew. The offspring of a relationship between a prostitute and the priest in his pre-born-again days Elvis also takes a shine to his half sister (Pell James). The first-time director James Marsh and his co-writer Milo Addica (who wrote ""Monsters Ball"") sustain a black-comic tone and the performances as far they go are quietly chilling. But they dont go far enough and neither does the movie. Its a sick joke inflated to parable size. Grade BThe Omen (R)Director John Moore. With Julia Stiles Liev Schreiber. (110 min.) Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? There was no reason to have remade ""The Omen"" and so of course it has been remade. This is one of those movies that profits from very low expectations. If you go in expecting something dreadful be assured Its only near dreadful. Liev Schreiber looking like he has just emerged from a root-canal job plays the Gregory Peck role of the US ambassador to Britain who cant accept the fact that his Damien is really the son of Beelzebub. Or is it just that Schreiber cant accept the fact that hes in this movie which has the temerity to include 9/11 footage in its panoply of horrors? In an amusing piece of casting Mia Farrow plays the boys nanny. Grade C Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Still in ReleaseThe Break-Up (PG-13)Director Peyton Reed. With Vince Vaughn Jennifer Aniston. (105 min.)Gary (Vaughn) a tour-bus operator in Chicago spots Brooke (Aniston) an upscale art-gallery employee at a Cubs game and puts the rush on her with his motormouth come-ons. They end up sharing an elegant condo but eventually the relationship sours. Because both Gary and Brooke want to remain in the condo they end up living in separate battle zones around a common area. ""The Break-Up"" may be about relationships but it looks like it was made by people who have never been in one. Grade D+Clean (R)Director Olivier Assayas. With Maggie Cheung Nick Nolte. (111 min.)Most movies about junkies tend in the same direction - downward. ""Clean"" is a rare example of a film where the drug addict secures a second chance. Emily (Cheung) who has just lost her longtime rock musician boyfriend Lee to a heroin overdose decamps to her old bohemian stomping grounds in Paris - only to fall back into drug dependency. This is one movie where a characters spiritual redemption doesnt seem like a plot convenience.

The folks who devised the remake of The Omen may actually have gone them one better Their starting point might almost have been the release date (6/6/06). Which if so renders the movie a very expensive afterthought. The new Omen is slavishly faithful to the 1976 original which means that we get the same salivating jackal and owl-eyed cherubic Damien the same slow-moving heavy-lidded atmosphere of liturgical Catholic gloom the same Rube Goldberg impalings and decapitations the same schlock rehash of The Exorcist which was itself already a sensationalist reduction of Rosemarys Baby. Theres one moment that achieves the camp shiver of the original when Damiens nanny hangs herself at his birthday party (""Damien its all for you""). But the kid himself played by Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick doesnt look evil enough; hes too passive to be a devious contemporary child. Mia Farrow as the sinister new nanny makes her glazed spaciness work for once but its almost touching to see Liev Schreiber as Damiens ambassador father and Julia Stiles as the mother who thinks she gave birth to him (in fact he came from the Satanic Adoption Agency) neuter their personalities in homage to the solemn wooden acting of the original. I confess that I jumped in fright at the shock cuts of devil heads punctuated by electric screams. The rest of the time I felt like I was seeing The Da Vinci Code with slightly shadier priests.

"Six Sense washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Six Sense Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick as Damien Boy Devil in a new version of the 1976 supernatural thriller released on a satanically significant date. (By Vince Valitutti -- 20Th Century Fox) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Tuesday June 6 2006 Hellz still a-poppin in the remake -- well its more a tracing -- of the surprise hit of the 1976 movie season ""The Omen"" which gets a rare Tuesday opening in salute to an even rarer day of three sixes. The original was the first to put high-end stars (Gregory Peck Lee Remick) in a blood-soaked Devil-worshiping supernatural slick and -- did I say blood-soaked? -- horror movie which had been theretofore the province of second- and third-tier faces (such as the one belonging to Vincent Price). It was such a hit it got its director Richard Donner in line for a mainstream career (his next film was ""Superman"" and he later was founder and franchise owner of the ""Lethal Weapon"" series). One hopes it nicely feathered the nest of those sturdy yeomen of the American industry Peck and Remick. The remake is directed by another slickster the Irishman John Moore who is no deep thinker (as his ""Behind Enemy Lines"" confirmed) but like Donner hes an able hack -- smooth stylish clever soulless and a hoot. And sos his damned movie. And it is damned. Its still the same old story hardly updated possibly because the same typist is behind the same keyboard hitting the same keys. That writer would be David Seltzer here as before earning a solo writing credit. He hits the same high notes as before a horrifying moral paradox driving a taut detective-like story ahead well-lubricated by highly choreographed murders engineered from down under by His Satanic Majesty. Impalements burnings beheadings hangings all those nasty things done to witches in days of yore. Here theyre done again to the tune of malodorous choral music only the victims are the chaste the good and the pure. And on top of that You get to see Mia Farrow get creamed. Seltzers plot is simple and serviceable. When the just-born son of an American diplomat dies in the postnatal care theater the father (Liev Schreiber) knows it will break his fragile wifes heart if not her brain. A priest points out that an unwed mother has just perished in giving birth; could we not switch the now parentless newborn for the now-dead newborn? He doesnt bother to tell the young man that the babys mommy was a hyena or maybe a jackal or some other slavering canine from beyond the Styx. That deed done the son Damien grows into a beautiful boy but one with an odd sense of aloofness. He never speaks but projects a spooky sense of implacable serenity. At the same time he can issue a laser-shot of contempt through his beady little eyes (the production must have looked for months before it came up with a tot with just such a willed coldness to his presence in newcomer Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) that would give a black cat a myocardial infarction. When hes about 4 deaths begin happening around him each calculated to advance his position; a nanny spectacularly hangs herself (shocking in 1976 still shocking 30 years later). Soon lovable old Mrs. Baylock (Farrow) has shown up to take over as nanny and she bonds with Damien and begins radiating nutcase heat waves. A priest (Pete Postlethwaite) who comes to warn the couple (Schreibers Robert Thorn is by dint of another weird accident now full ambassador) seems nuts but ends up skewered like a Vienna cocktail wienie on a really big toothpick for his trouble. A photographer (David Thewlis) notes suggestive light streaks in the photos hes taken of two early victims implying their spectacular ends and so he begins to investigate first on his own then with Thorn. Cue the beheading machine. Anyway soon enough Daddy begins to wonder if the boy is actually He Whom the Liturgical Chants on the Soundtrack Heavily Suggest to Be Old Scratch in Diapers; that is the Devil himself the Antichrist. Whats a father to do? A lot of things stay the same. The movie still has the gloss of a Lincoln Continental commercial as it prowls through swanky European backdrops (Italy then England; it was filmed mostly in Prague). Its handsome in the way its fast-moving sleek well-engineered full of gooses and honks. Some of the casting seems a little off. For example the heroic parents David and Katherine Thorn played in the original by the patrician Peck and Remick are played by Schreiber and Julia Stiles. Whatever you think of their talent (Schreiber has lots Stiles less) the truth is they are too young for their roles which insist that he ends up the ambassador to the Court of St. Jamess. Schreiber hardly a patrician looks more like the ambassador to the Kensington Gardens Courtyard by Marriott. Stiles looks like a hatcheck girl in a 40s melodrama. You keep thinking Where are the Pecks of yesteryear? What are these kids doing in grown-up clothes? Still it works. Moore keeps the thing humming leaping from atrocity to atrocity. And he gets something weird that is the deep and abiding pleasure certain people feel in watching the elaborate extermination tricks assembled diabolically. For Moore anything can be a killing machine. To cite one example when a certain character gets that extremely deep crew cut (note to cultural scorekeepers The ever-progressive American film industry has finally surpassed the Japanese film industry in depicting that magic moment when Mr. Head goes over here and Mr. Body goes over there) he has a laff riot of a time tracking the implausibilities that lead up to it. A roofer ticks a hammer with his foot it lands squarely on a rusty bolt shearing it and thus a heavy steel sign is freed to rotate on a rusty rod its lower edge picking up the speed and fury of Mme. Guillotine and it loops down just as todays victim is standing in the arc of its rotation and -- And Moore reiterates the other unsettling disturbing aspect of ""The Omen"" which is in itself a cautionary warning of the power of film to manipulate. That is as the movie rushes toward its finish it subverts the audience into mobhood; it makes us no longer human. It makes us yearn to break our deepest moral code and harm a child. The guy behind me summed it up ""Kill that little freak"" he implored. Now thats scary. The Omen (110 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for disturbing extreme and graphic violence and some profanity.

Starring Julia Stiles Liev Schreiber and Mia Farrow. Directed by John Moore. (R 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The child actor they got to play Satan spawn Damien in the remake of ""The Omen"" is beyond perfect. This kid can be making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and the look on his face is more frightening than all the scary scenes in ""Silent Hill"" and ""An American Haunting"" put together. Its good that he stands out because for better or worse theres not much beyond the performances to distinguish this horror thriller from the 1976 ""The Omen"" starring Gregory Peck and Lee Remick. While other remakes of scary 70s movies have tossed in 21st century updates -- ""When a Stranger Calls"" ... now with text messaging -- the formula here is the same Big-name actors. Slow pace. Shocking deaths. Creepy little kid with a bowl haircut. Other than the obvious marketing advantages of releasing this movie on 06/06/06 a second ""Omen"" seems completely unnecessary even if it is kind of fun. The set-up -- diplomat Robert Thorns wife has a stillborn child so priests replace it with another baby who turns out to be the devils son -- is the same although the scenario seems even more ridiculous now. Anyone who has given birth in the age of HMOs knows that hospitals do everything short of installing LoJack in the fetus to avoid a switched-baby scenario. Do you think Kaiser wants 45 straight days of bad publicity on ""Nancy Grace?"" Thorn is named ambassador to England and after horrific things keep happening to people close to his son he becomes a tabloid newspaper target. A seedy photographer played by David Thewlis suspects supernatural forces are responsible and a mystery unravels punctuated by a series of gory chain-reaction deaths. (Young people might think ""The Omen"" is paying homage to the ""Final Destination"" series when its really the other way around.) Among the actors only Liev Schreiber in the Thorn role is a disappointment giving an uninterested monotone performance that recalls Christopher Lambert in his prime ""Highlander"" years. Julia Stiles is much better as Katherine Thorn overcoming the movies Jerry Lee Lewis casting (Stiles looks like shes 14 and Schreiber looks 40) to bring nuances to her stay-at-home mom role. Newcomer Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick is outstanding as Damien -- immediately joining Haley Joel Osment and those two little girls from ""The Shining"" in the Freaky-Looking Kid Hall of Fame. The producers also recruited a Robert Altman movie-worth of great character actors including Michael Gambon and Pete Postlethwaite. Is there anyone other than Postlethwaite who could shout the line ""Its mother is a jackal"" and not sound totally ridiculous? In this crowd of master thespians Mia Farrow elbows everyone off the stage playing a very polite but seriously imbalanced nanny who acts as Damiens protector. Whether it was done with studio makeup and camera tricks or real-life sessions with Dr. 90210 Farrows face is now approaching Loni Anderson/Priscilla Presley levels of wax-like immobility. And what could be scarier than that? Director John Moore plays the light-versus-dark themes for all theyre worth and his visual style helps make ""The Omen"" feel like a mature horror film. Truth be told the director uses many of the same cheap-thrill techniques featured in the ""Friday the 13th"" films but Moore has the skills to make it look like art. Writer David Seltzer who also scripted the original ""The Omen"" makes a few huge missteps in the second try. The movie is derailed early on by video of the smoking Twin Towers Hurricane Katrina damage and tsunami destruction in Thailand -- all described as signs of the coming of the Beast. Whether or not its too soon to include these recent disasters in a feature film is a matter of opinion but in terms of filming a fantasy these distracting real-world images take a while to get over. And even though the new ""Omen"" has a nearly identical plot it is missing the best part from the original film and its sequels -- that totally sweet ""Sanguis bebimus Corpus edimus"" chanting in Jerry Goldsmiths musical score which got cranked up every time Damien did something particularly evil. (The words translate to ""We drink the blood We eat the flesh"" How cool is that?) The remake is a solidly crafted movie with a lot of good scares but it also raises the question Why even bother with an update? On a scale of 1 to 1200 ""The Omen"" gets a 666. -- Advisory This film contains profanity gore and multiple themes involving murdering children. Anyone who is pregnant intends to get pregnant or just loves babies should not only run screaming from ""The Omen"" but spend the next month watching PBS stations to avoid stumbling onto the movies commercials. ...

"This Omen is so bad its scary - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW This Omen is so bad its scary By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  June 6 2006 Its a terrible sign for a movie when the sole reason for its existence is a satanic opening date. Yes in case youve missed it today is 06/06/06 perfect for Hollywood to deliver an otherwise pointless cabalistic blow to our heads. For this occasion the blunt instrument is a remake of Richard Donners legitimately scary 1976 horror flick ``The Omen"" about a couple unwittingly raising Satans little boy.Gregory Peck and Lee Remick played the couple in the original picture. Liev Schreiber and Julia Stiles both looking miserable take the same parts in this new version which John Moore has directed without much wit or feeling. The screenwriter for both movies is David Seltzer who merely appears to have dusted off his original and handed it in to the studio. The first one was chilling. This remake is an icy bore.It gets underway when an evil priest swaps the couples newborn for a demon seed. He tells Roger Thorn (Schreiber) that their child died after labor and that this little orphan will make a perfect replacement. His wife Katherine (Stiles) has no idea whats going on but really a mother always knows. Sort of. The adopted tot grows into Damien a 6-year-old sourpuss played with one facial expression by Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick and Katherines awakening to his evil has to be beaten into her -- chiefly by the boy himself.To put it mildly the Devil pulls some strings landing Roger a job as the US ambassador in London. So he isnt around when Damien puts his increasingly clued-in mom in the hospital. (Ladies when Satans kid is riding his Big Wheel around your mansion never water your plants perched on a chair overlooking a 100-foot drop.)Another priest (Pete Postlethwaite) keeps showing up to warn Roger that something terrible is afoot. So does an omnipresent photographer (David Thewlis) who happens to be building a fetching photo library of all the Devils victims.Eventually the atheistic Roger comes around and his suspicion turns ``The Omen"" into a chase picture not unlike ``The Da Vinci Code"" in which he and the photographer try to solve the mystery. But Moore shows greater interest in concocting a chic-looking movie than in making our skin crawl and the violently loud score works harder than he does to spook us. (It succeeds only in producing migraines.) Beyond the alluring production design and some tasteless allusions to 9/11 and the Challenger disaster its hard to explain whyd we need another ``Omen.""Since nearly every Catholic-minded horror movie in the last 30 years has cribbed from Donners movie this remakes attempts to shock and surprise seem monotonously by the book. Even if you missed the 76 version you already know whats going on. Material this stupid and this familiar needs a touch of camp but Mia Farrow as Damiens unholy nanny is the only participant who brings the goods.Now that no one seems to have the patience interest or skill to build a suspenseful horrifying horror film theres nowhere for the genres misogyny to hide. Moore for instance saves his inspired shot-making for Stiless demise. There are attractive images of her brushing her teeth in a big white room (its the Oral-B commercial from hell) and the sequence of her plummeting from that balcony is beautiful. Why would someone with Stiless talent want such a thankless part?Stiles is punched scratched dropped and worse. The fear in her face seems real That kid playing Damien is no boy hes Chucky the killer doll from the ``Childs Play"" movies. Theres no prestige in this kind of acting for her. But at next years MTV Movie Awards shes a shoo-in to win Best Frightened Performance.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; omen-the ) Omen The (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli The Omen is regarded as a horror classic although I have never been able to figure out why Richard Donners second-rate exploitation flick has been accorded such a lofty status. Since the 2006 re-make is almost identical to its predecessor (even using essentially the same script) theres no reason to expect me to think more highly of this film. To the extent that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery the crew behind the original might be expected to blush. From my perspective however the only reason to embark upon a re-make is to offer a new unique or interesting perspective. All that The Omen succeeds at is proving that director John Moore could have a nice alternative career working for Xerox. The first version of The Omen came out in 1976 during a time when apocalyptic beliefs and scenarios were the rage. The idea that we might be in a Biblical ""end time"" was a popular pop theory and it led to a lot of pointless speculation about what prominent individual might fit the profile of the so-called Antichrist. The Omen capitalized on this phenomenon and was popular enough to spin off two sequels. Thirty years later however many of the films elements seem quaint almost to the point of being anachronistic. Admittedly there are still segments of Christianity that preach the imminent approach of the end of the world but they are mostly seen as fringe groups. The collapse of the USSR removed the Apocalypse from the mainstream. For U.S. Deputy Ambassador to Italy Robert Thorn (Liev Schreiber) and his wife Katherine (Julia Stiles) tragedy occurs on June 6 when their first child is stillborn. A priest at the hospital offers Robert an option he can ""trade"" his dead son for a healthy baby boy whose mother passed away during the birthing process. Katherine need never know the truth. Robert agrees. Five years later the parents and their son Damien (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) are living in London. They employ a nanny Mrs. Baylock (Mia Farrow) to help care for the boy. However people all around Damien are dying and Katherine becomes convinced that he is possessed by an evil force. A fanatical priest (Pete Posthethwaite) and a journalist (David Thewlis) believe something more astonishing Damien is the anti-Christ. To give Moore credit he does a good job at peppering The Omen with ""boo"" moments. Im usually immune to cheap theatrical scares but a couple of these with their ear-splitting musical stings got me. Unfortunately thats all the movie has going for it. Those who have seen the original The Omen will find nothing new or surprising here. Its the most literal remake since Gus Van Sant copied Psycho. One of the few new elements to be found in The Omen is a shot of the World Trade Center collapsing - a moment that will raise legitimate questions about using the image for exploitative purposes. Theres an ironic parallel between The Omen and The Da Vinci Code. The latter follows the protagonist and his side-kick as they travel across Europe seeking clues about a descendant of Jesus Christ. In The Omen a protagonist and his sidekick travel across Europe seeking clues about a descendant of Satan. Both films are as unappealing as watching a scavenger hunt. At least The Da Vinci Code contains enough controversial elements to sex things up. All The Omen has going for it are dubious interpretations of Biblical passages and a satisfyingly gory decapitation. Plus David Thewlis is not as easy on the eyes as Audrey Tautou. Moore has recruited a lackluster cast. Julia Stiles and Liev Schreiber are B-grade performers who have avoided stardom because theyre boring and they live up to their reputations here. David Thewlis who normally plays the heavy gets a chance to take on more of a ""good guy"" role. Mia Farrow who has a Satanic baby in her past is creepy as Nanny Baylock. One can understand why Woody Allen left her. Pete Postlethwaite who has made a career out of playing weird characters is in his environment here. Michael Gambon has a blink-and-youll-miss-it cameo. Finally newcomer Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick has no trouble exhibiting Damiens blank stare although thats about as far as his acting capabilities go. I suppose whats unique about The Omen is the concept that a seemingly defenseless child is the spawn of the Devil. It brings to mind the conundrum about traveling back in time to stand beside Hitlers crib. Could you kill the child even knowing the great evil that would result from his surviving into adulthood? Unfortunately Roberts moral dilemma isnt presented in a compelling fashion. We know from the beginning that Damien is rotten to the core. Roberts qualms about driving a variety of knives into his sons body seem like a weakness of character or spirit. (One also has to ask this question if the Pope and his advisors believe Damien to be the Antichrist why leave it to Robert to commit the assassination. Why not order a Vatican-orchestrated hit which would presumably have a greater chance of succeeding?) Its hard to guess who the projected audience is for The Omen. Maybe the only reason the film was made is because someone thought up a good marketing ploy for opening day (6/6/06 which replicates the ""666"" Sign of the Beast). The R-rating locks out the teenage crowd who are todays biggest consumers of PG-13 horror. Its hard to imagine college age movie goers being attracted by such a passA(c) premise. And fans of the original will end up doing shot-by-shot comparisons. On every level The Omen isnt just bad filmmaking its bad storytelling.

But look at those monkeys. Listen to that chatter. Are they really afraid? Hoo-hoo-ha-ha-ha could mean something other than ""Ahhh Its the antichrist"" The monkeys might be laughing. If so its one of several natural responses to The Omen a slavishly literal remake of the satanic-horror standby that elicits laughter sleep and occasional eye-popped shock but drums up scant real terror. It offers a few cheap shots of adrenaline nothing more. But fear? Fear lurks nowhere in The Omen. From the start Richard Donners 1976 demon-child classic was less scary than jolting but it had Gregory Peck it had spooky priests and it had fantastically gluey death scenes the likes of which few viewers had ever seen. If the pace felt like a slow drive on a potholed street (crawl BUMP crawl BUMP) Pecks Lincolnesque moral certitude and the films then-unprecedented graphic show-stoppers pushed it along. It became a phenomenon and spawned three sequels one for TV. Thirty years later the gross-out novelty is gone and so is Peck. In his place stands Liev Schreiber a gifted actor whose own baritonal gravitas cant quite shoulder this poky and affected borefest. Its not his fault. The fault lies with director John Moore (Flight of the Phoenix) and noncredited screenwriter Dan McDermott whose ""update"" of David Seltzers original screenplay includes a few concessions to the passage of time and technology So Damien plays videos whoop-de-do. Its visual effects are gussied up but like Gus Van Sants shot-for-shot homage to Psycho its an anachronism. You know the script. Schreiber plays Damiens father a U.S. diplomat who agrees to swap his stillborn son with a healthy orphan after spooky priest No. 1 (Giovanni Lombardo Radice) assures him its ""Gods plan."" Au contraire its Satans plan and pretty soon beatific 5-year-old Damien (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick a cute boy with a vicious frown) is inspiring his nanny to hang herself. Not long afterward we encounter spooky priest No. 2 (Pete Postlethwaite) who exhorts Damiens father to ""defeat the devils son."" Damiens mother (Julia Stiles) meanwhile shops around for a new nanny when who comes to the rescue but Mia Farrow her space-case routine well honed as a gentle-mannered demonic minion in cahoots with Damien. Spooky priests Nos. 1 and 2 reappear disgustingly in later scenes. Lots of arty blood-red props allude to lots of arty blood-red violence including a gonzo retake of the original films iconic decapitation-by-glass scene. Shot through everything are the usual woozy horror sounds (whistling wind distant growls men chanting ""Ohhh"") and agitated visions (a crucifix a bleeding baby someone in a bad latex mask) all of which are meant to scare the pudding out of us. Other fright tactics include early scenes set at the Vatican where yet more spooky priests shudder at news of a comet that heralds Armageddon. So is it coming? Lets see today is June 6 2006 or 6/6/06 -- the mark of the devil right on time.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Weve offered simple rules for zombie movies and simple rules for horror films. Time for a new set of suggestions for another genre Movies Where You Suspect Your Son Might Be the Antichrist. This weeks remake of 1976s ""The Omen"" provides these handy lessons 1. If you fear your son might bear the mark of the beast names like Damien are out. Also Jason (see ""Friday the 13th"") or Freddy (various ""Nightmares"") or Michael for that matter (see ""Halloween""). Try naming the kid Brad. Or Dennis. Very few horsemen of the Apocalypse have been named Tyler. 2.When hiring a nanny for the pint-sized Prince of Darkness you might want to avoid Mia Farrow. Given her role in ""Rosemarys Baby"" this might not be the best choice for an in-home day-care provider. 3. While acquiring a dog companion for your bad boy avoid Rottweilers or Dobermans. Buy him a nice teacup poodle. Hounds of Hell has a nice ring to it but Shih-Tzus of Hell make better pets. 4. If at your boys fifth birthday party your nanny climbs up on the roof with a noose around her neck and calls his name dont look up. Nothing good will come of this. 5. Dont stand on ladders teetering over three-story atriums when Satans Spawn is riding his scooter. Get somebody else to change the light bulb or spritz the hanging planters. 6. To better notice any stray ""666"" birth marks keep the lads hair cut short. Lord knows with the mop-top haircuts kids sport these days youll never know if its the Beast playing your X-Box. Students of the original spooky ""Omen"" will have noticed by now that the remake is almost shot-for-shot prophecy. Screenwriter David Seltzer double-dips with his screenplay barely updating his 1976 version with cellphones and digital cameras. (Too bad Seltzer never tells us ""Whats on Damiens iPod."" Im guessing Icelandic death metal Wagner and a lot of screamo.) The update is serviceable but fairly bland. Gregory Peck and Lee Remick made a pretty dynamic pair in 1976 but Liev Schreiber and Julia Stiles dont pack the same ominous wallop. As Damien Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick does an adequate job of saying ""Boo"" just with his eyes. But horror remakes are tricky. The first time around we can suspend disbelief and let the general chill answer any lingering questions. When the characters get a do-over 30 years later we want to shout at them ""Didnt you see this movie? When the priest says God will forgive this little deception dont swap babies"" Which brings us to rule No. 7 Dont walk near cathedrals during lightning storms. There. Our work is done. If your second-grader starts assembling the Army of Beelzebub dont come crying to us.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Radio End-of-Days The sweet sweet sadness of Robert Altmans Prairie Home Companion. By David Edelstein Published ShareThis Illustration by Charles Wilkin  (Photo Melinda Sue Gordon/Courtesy of Picturehouse) The Chatterbox Cafe is what Garrison Keillor calls the restaurant in his fictional upper-Minnesota town of Lake Wobegon and its there I imagine him and Robert Altman having lunch to discuss A Prairie Home Companion their fantasia on Keillors public-radio show. Im not sure how much these two born-and-bred Midwesterners have in common philosophically Keillor still grapples with his Lutheranism while Altman treats religion more sardonically. But both men famously taciturn have spent their careers hovering on the sidelines watching extroverts talk past one another. Thats their point of overlap and its enough to give A Prairie Home Companion an atmosphere both boisterous and holy. The movie redolent of death is a sort of wake but a funny-sad one teeming with music corny jokes and an ensemble of gifted performers who appear to be having an obscene amount of fun in one anothers company. That funand that sadnessis contagious. A lot of people have ridiculed the radio show over the years for what they see as elitism masquerading as folksy populism but in the almost quarter-century Ive been listening whats held me is the underlying melancholy. Big and weird-looking rooted in a religion in which you were a sinner until proved innocent (which is never) and in a frigid place in which people were too hardy (and too buttoned-up) to dramatize their misery Keillor could never be at home in his body. His transcendence came via that deep plangent voice and he went on to concoct a universe in which it could preside a radio variety showcumchurch service free of doctrine but with spirituals skits and even an oblique sermon (News From Lake Wobegon). The materials are shopworn but in a good way Keillor finds spiritual nourishment in the bric-a-brac of old radio even in jingles for things like biscuits and duct tape. Its not salvation but its a tender mercy. Keillor sets the film on the night of the last broadcast of A Prairie Home Companionhere a parallel-universe show not nearly as renowned a casualty of its theaters imminent demolition. Among the dramatis personae are characters from Keillors sketches made flesh the detective Guy Noir (Kevin Kline) not so much radios rumpled gumshoe as a preening dandy and the cowboys Dusty (John C. Reilly) and Lefty (Woody Harrelson) a rambunctious pair of pickers and crooners. The musicians are both real and fictional bandleader Rich Dworsky; Robin and Linda Williams; Jearlyn Steele; and the Johnson sisters Yolanda (Meryl Streep) and Rhonda (Lily Tomlin). And of course there is Keillor himself both the center of the movie and a dazed bystander. A virtuoso of flux Altman is in his element. The camera travels up and down and side to side trailing characters as they hurtle from dressing rooms to wings to lobby. You catch bits of babble from backstage personnel (among them radio regulars Sue Scott and Tim Russell and Saturday Night Lives Maya Rudolph as a pregnant harried stage manager). Altman lingers now and again on the stageon Keillors musings or parts of numbersbut hes easily distracted. A car pulls up with the Axeman (Tommy Lee Jones) a steel-spectacled Scripture-quoting company worm there to watch the death of a theater. And on a more surreal note death itself arrives in the form of a golden-haired woman (Virginia Madsen) who comes to enfold a performer in a loving embrace. The ingenue-of-death thing is dicey the staging a little flat; its only Madsens unaffected radiance and Klines over-the-top infatuationshes the dame of his dreamsthat keep the device from being utterly risible. Sometimes you forget how great an actor is then he or she is reborn in an Altman movie. It happens with Kline a master of athletic deadpan who elegantly lights a cigarette and nearly burns off his mustache. Streep is just as brilliant. Her Yolanda is a goosy creature with sloppy cleavage and a Minnesota twitter It might have been a caricature but when she plays a performer a childish joy breaks through her often overcontrolled demeanor. And if Tomlins face has become a bit of a mask in recent years her dryness makes her Streeps perfect foiland her timing is as gorgeous as ever. A Prairie Home Companion has off notes. Keillors writing is too glib for Yolandas high-school daughter who pens bad poems about suicide and the casting of Lindsay Lohan throws you out of the movie (although shes not bad). And Keillor isnt a film actor. Its not that features are squashed in the middle of his big head. Its that hes simply too well defendedtoo insulatedto open himself up to the camera. Inexplicably theres no News From Lake Wobegon which might have accounted for his defenses and connected some of the movies dots. 1 2 Next Share this story...

Remaking the original with only modest updates and augmentation ""The Omen"" poses an intriguing question Will a movie that scared the bejeezus out of moviegoers 30 years ago pack the necessary wallop and carnage to satisfy fans of blood-soaked modern horror? The answer is a qualified yes if only because the premise of the Devils child loosed upon the Earth remains so inherently spooky feeding the modern fascination with conspiracies and apocalyptic threats. Cleverly unleashing the film on 6/6/06 (a Tuesday? Why not) Fox should attract those yet-to-be born for the earlier version while fostering curiosity among those who were. David Seltzer who authored the 1976 movie receives script credit as well he should given the mostly cosmetic (and in some ways beneficial) changes -- including fleeting references to recent events such as the 2004 tsunami and even Sept. 11 as signs of Armageddon. The other major switch less successful involves going considerably younger with the leads casting Liev Schreiber and Julia Stiles (wasnt she doing teen roles like two years ago?) as the couple that unwittingly becomes guardians of the Anti-Christ played by cherub-faced newcomer Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick. Pic labors a bit to explain how Robert Thorn (Schreiber) godson of the president becomes the youngest-ever ambassador to England. From then on though director John Moore delivers whats close to a shot-for-shot remake with some savvy casting of supporting roles including Mia Farrow (in an homage to ""Rosemarys Baby"") as Damiens satanic governess. Once again Thorn agrees to take in an orphaned baby as a replacement for his own stillborn child. As the tyke grows however clues that something is different about him drip out slowly if not particularly subtly and its mother Katherine (Stiles) who gradually recognizes them -- animals acting up at the zoo a nanny committing suicide the kid throwing a hissy fit at the prospect of going into a church. Eventually Robert must also grapple with the truth albeit after prodding by a mysterious priest (Pete Postlethwaite) who warns of an end-of-the-world scenario and help from a photographer (David Thewlis) who begins to put the pieces together. Moore (whose last film was another remake ""Flight of the Phoenix"") has a reputation for visual flair which he introduces through eerie dream sequences but in the main he adheres closely to Seltzer and director Richard Donners template from the prevailing sense of dread to the atmosphere of general gloom interrupted by well spaced and effective bursts of gore. That said pic is deficient on a few levels. Shot principally in Prague theoretically to keep costs down the production in places betrays a low-budget look. Also the final act lacks the pacing punch and suspense of the original -- or maybe they just dont breed Rottweilers like they used so. And while Marco Beltrami has delivered an evocative score a snippet of the late Jerry Goldsmiths masterpiece ""Ave Satani"" over the closing credits stirs a hunger for more. Despite seeming too young Stiles and Schreiber go through the paces gamely enough with Schreiber -- if lacking the gravitas Gregory Peck brought to the proceedings -- still left wrestling with the daunting chore of thwarting biblical prophecy through the ritual murder of a little boy. Of course the first ""Omen"" spawned a pair of highly forgettable sequels raising questions as to where a revived franchise might go. Then again if Fox execs must confront the high-class problem of deciding what do for an encore rest assured that it will be the audience not the Devil that makes them do it.
