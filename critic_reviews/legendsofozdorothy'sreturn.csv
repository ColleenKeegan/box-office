Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Since all of L. Frank Baums Oz novels are in the public domain there have been countless continuations and adaptations of the series with varying degrees of separation from canon to apocrypha. Legends Of Oz Dorothys Return--based on Dorothy Of Oz a 1989 novel by L. Frank Baums grandson Roger S. Baum and the first in a series intended for younger readers--makes for an odd choice as a computer-animated feature film adaptation. Sure it features the characters everyone cares about Dorothy Gale (Lea Michele) Scarecrow (Dan Aykroyd) Tin Man (Kelsey Grammer) and Lion (Jim Belushi). But theyre altered for the worse and stranded apart from one another for a story that has precious little message other than ""beware of obvious hucksters."" In Oz the now-genius Scarecrow works with Lion (hes dropped the ""cowardly"" and gained a crown) and an over-emoting Tin Man to send an emergency message from Emerald City to Dorothy. An evil Jester (Martin Short) threatens to take over Oz and hes turning beloved (yet unfamiliar) characters into puppets with a magic wand a ret-conned possession leftover from the Wicked Witch Of The West.Dorothy awakens in Kansas after another twister--one that destroys the Gales house and the surrounding town yet somehow didnt merit a retreat to the storm cellar. After a slimy and questionably credentialed insurance appraiser (Short again because there must be a real-world villain parallel in Oz stories) shows up to condemn all the houses in town and coerce their owners to quickly sign them away and vacate the Gales resign themselves to selling and moving. As Dorothy rues her inability to fix everything she and Toto are whisked back to Oz via a moving rainbow (why not?) though not to Emerald City. Instead of her familiar companions a new group joins Dorothy on her journey of rediscovery Wiser (Oliver Platt) a flightless chatterbox owl; Marshal Mallow (Hannibals Hugh Dancy) a marshmallow soldier from Candy County; and Dainty China Princess (Megan Hilty) the... princess of Dainty China Country. Casting a legitimately prodigious Broadway talent like Michele in an iconic role like Dorothy is a no-brainer but problems abound from the rushed beginning all the way through the impossibly resolved ending. Instead of traveling through an Oz that even somewhat resembles one familiar to anyone versed in the MGM classic Dorothy and her new cadre wander through what is essentially a mash-up of Candyland and the Mad Hatters tea party. The Jester like his human counterpart has only a tenuous foundation as a villain. Hes the Wicked Witch Of The Wests brother who was forced to serve as her downtrodden fool and now... hes inexplicably evil. The new characters are as weakly drawn as the old guard--who are locked up by the jester for most of the movie and sorely missed. Formidable as the cast list looks on paper the voice acting reeks of cash grabs and the performances are way off (Grammers Tin Man in particular). Not a single one of the grating songs is likely to be remembered after the credits roll. At one point as Dorothy and Wiser stuff their faces full of candy due to some nefarious sign-changing from the Jester Short sings a seemingly never-ending list of candy names that does absolutely nothing but stretch out the tune to an acceptable length.The land Dorothy visits in Legends is not the merry old land of Oz--its a retread as flimsy as cotton candy. NBCs gamble on broadcasting a live staging of The Sound Of Music paid off so well that Fox is already giving Grease the same treatment. But the only good thing to come from Legends Of Oz is the idea that perhaps once Glee concludes its final season and that long-rumored Funny Girl revival is complete someone will cast Lea Michele as Dorothy in a worthier musical adaptation of Baums material.

(Weinstein) C Legends of Oz Dorothys Return Starring Dan Aykroyd Kelsey Grammer Lea Michele; Director Will Finn; Release Date Wide 05/09/2014; Runtime (in minutes) 88; Distributor Clarius Entertainment Posted June 3 2014 -- 1200 AM EDT As unnecessary uninspired Wizard of Oz revivals go (see also Oz The Great and Powerful Return to Oz the Wicked Witch parts of Once Upon a Time) this 3-D animated off-brand tale isnt exactly wicked -- its just a little short on brains. Dorothy (voiced by Lea Michele) is now a cowboy-booted country girl fighting to keep her familys home in Kansas and shes teleported back to Oz by the Scarecrow (Dan Aykroyd) Lion (Jim Belushi) and Tin Man (Kelsey Grammer) to rescue Glinda (Bernadette Peters) from the grips of the evil Jester (Martin Short). On her way to the Emerald City Dorothy runs into a slew of new Ozzies including an oversize owl named Wiser (Oliver Platt) the brave and squishy Marshal Mallow (Hugh Dancy) and a snooty China Princess (Megan Hilty) whose royal fortification -- a literal great wall of China -- is one of the movies best throwaway gags. Based on the book Dorothy of Oz by Roger Stanton Baum (great-grandson of Oz creator L. Frank Baum) and featuring so-so original music by Bryan Adams and co-writer Jim Vallance Legends should serve its presumed purpose of hypnotizing kids. Its rainbow-hued animation is like a CG Candy Land board come to computerized life. But theres barely a trace of the magic of 1939s The Wizard of Oz; the bricks are still yellow but the road doesnt lead anywhere special.

JOHN SEMLEY Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday May 09 2014 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday May 09 2014 1200AM EDT Comments AA Classification G Country USA Language English To its credit the 3-D computer-animated musical Legends Of Oz Dorothys Return sidesteps the smirking Shrek-y snark that mars so much kiddie cinema. The Tin Man (Kelsey Grammer) doesnt wear sunglasses or breakdance or anything. Theres no nagging desperate hipness. In its place is an old-timey earnestness sincere to the point of boredom as G-rated Legends charts the quest of Dorothy (Glees Lea Michele) to thwart an evil jester (Martin Short) who wields the powers of the late Wicked Witch. But its short on jokes and hampered by unmemorable musical numbers (including one about building a boat) and the films niceness cant overcome the dopey tedium.

Credit Clarius Entertainment The maps included with many Oz books promised bookish completists that there was always another little corner of this flip-side world to explore. That sense of imagination is largely absent from ""Legends of Oz Dorothys Return"" a second-rate animated adaptation of a spinoff by Roger Stanton Baum L. Frank Baums great-grandson. Still the films set-piece journey through China Country ruled over by a tiny haughty porcelain princess (a delightful Megan Hilty) is a highlight the picture of a self-absorbed royal hamlet with its own rules and wigs.China Country is one stop on a rescue mission undertaken by Dorothy (Lea Michele of ""Glee"") here a blandly courageous kid whos summoned to save Oz from an evil jester (Martin Short). In addition to her usual trio of pals there are a helpful tubby owl (Oliver Platt) and later a talking tree (Patrick Stewart) that turns into a boat.The owls argyle-pattern chest is a nice touch as is the trees textured grain. But fine details like these must be picked out from among more slipshod visuals much as the one-liners are lost in the wash of generic back-and-forth and weak characterizations. (The bookend Kansas sequences are generally an embarrassment.)The films songs imperfectly staged feel pitched to younger tots uneasily bridging Broadway and a childrens television show. All in all the beloved kingdom of Oz is not well served though theres just enough detectable affection to keep it from feeling like a pure cashing-in.""Legends of Oz"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for all the perils of a commute from Kansas.

May 8 2014Legends of Oz Dorothys ReturnAnimated musical comedy featuring the voices of Dan Aykroyd James Belushi Kelsey Grammer Lea Michele Martin Short Hugh Dancy and Patrick Stewart. Directed by Will Finn and Dan St. Pierre. 95 minutes. Opens Friday at GTA theatres. GA big-name cast singing songs co-written by rocker Bryan Adams still cant save animated clunker Legends of Oz Dorothys Return a flat-footed attempt to cash in on the story first told in L. Frank Baums beloved books and 1939 film with a rebooted 3D version.This Emerald City adventure is based on More Adventures of Oz penned in 1989 by Baums great-grandson banker-turned-writer Roger Stanton Baum.Article Continued BelowAlthough the initial action is set in modern-day Kansas there is enough from the original tale of Dorothy including a tornado yellow brick road and her little dog too to make the story familiar. Theres another contemporary update a healthy dose of girl power is injected into Dorothy often called by her full name Dorothy Gale and voiced by Glees Lea Michele.Legends of Oz Dorothys Return is based on a story written by L. Frank baums great-grandson.Co-directed by DreamWorks and Disney animation veterans Will Finn and Dan St. Pierre screenwriters Adam Balsam and Randi Barnes send Dorothy newly returned from Oz right back to the Emerald City on a ""rainbow mover"" dispatched by the Scarecrow (Dan Aykroyd).Scarecrow Tin Man (Kelsey Grammer) and no-longer cowardly lion (James Belushi) need Dorothys help to go up against the power-mad brother of the now melted Wicked Witch Jester (Martin Short bellowing both songs and lines).Creepy computer animation gives the characters both human and fantasy the bizarrely cold sheen of those direct-to-DVD animated works about Barbie and Tinkerbelle. Glinda mechanically voiced by Bernadette Peters looks like a victim of bad plastic surgery.New adventures await for crusading Dorothy as she sets out to save the day but the pace feels off and new sidekicks Wiser (Oliver Platt) an obese over-sharing owl imperious China Princess (Megan Hilty who played Glinda in Broadways Wicked) and helpful tree Tugg (Patrick Stewart) arent going to stick in anyones memory.Hugh Dancy is the exception as the sweet-natured Candy Country officer Marshal Mallow. Not only does he engage with a fine singing voice his shyly big-hearted character nicely blends the heroic and vulnerable.Too bad the jokes arent funny and stirred little reaction in the kid-filled screening. And Jester isnt just mean in the broad sense of cartoon villains; his torment of the flying monkey leader is downright vicious.Devoid of the visual magic and heartfelt emotion of the original film this version of Oz and Dorothy 2.0 feel like the cheaply made knockoffs you find in a dollar store garishly shiny flimsy and not built to last. ""Toto this doesnt look like the Oz I remember"" Dorothy tells her furry sidekick upon her arrival which effectively sums up this charmless cash-grab.

Photo Credit Clarius Entertainment advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Dorothy Gale must save Oz from a new villain The Jester. Rated PG (some scary images and mild peril) BOTTOM LINE An uninspired sequel with weird characters generic rock songs and none of the original storys heart. CAST Voices of Lea Michele Dan Aykroyd Martin Short Kelsey Grammer LENGTH 130 More than ruby slippers or poppies the most magical ingredient in the story of Oz was simplicity. Its the reason were all still familiar with a 75-year-old movie ""The Wizard of Oz"" adapted from whats now a 114-year-old novel by L. Frank Baum. The lost little girl and her companions all wishing for powers they already have -- these characters resonate in a way that needs no explanation. Simplicity has been missing from every ""Oz"" sequel since. After all the only way to continue a story is to complicate it. Subsequent screenwriters (and Baum himself) have come up with whimsical new characters like Jack Pumpkinhead from the 1985 flop ""Return to Oz"" and clever new story lines like the Wizards tale in last years ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" but none have had the original storys powerful mythical simplicity. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? A new animated movie ""Legends of Oz Dorothys Return"" continues the tradition. Based on a 1989 novel by Baums great-grandson Roger Stanton Baum it begins just as Dorothy Gale (the voice of Lea Michele of Foxs ""Glee"") regains consciousness in her tornado-ravaged house. Within moments however a rainbow-shaped teleporter whisks her back to Oz where years have passed. Scarecrow (Dan Aykroyd) is now a math whiz the Tin Man (Kelsey Grammer) cant control his emotions and the Lion (Jim Belushi) is a blustery brawler. That beloved trio is quickly incapacitated by the evil Jester (a manic Martin Short) leaving Dorothy to find new companions. Ranging from ill-conceived to grotesque they include the mordibly obese owl Wiser (Oliver Platt) a candy soldier named Marshal Mallow (Hugh Dancy) and Dainty China Princess an insufferably privileged 18th century aristocrat (Megan Hilty) whose hollow porcelain body seems almost intended as a Marxist metaphor. Bernadette Peters is the voice of a spaced-out Glinda; Patrick Stewart plays a tree so old he begs to be whittled into a boat. Stiffly animated sluggishly directed (by Daniel St. Pierre and Will Finn) and padded out with generic Broadway-rock tunes co-written by Bryan Adams (yep the one who sang ""Cuts Like a Knife"" in 1983) ""Legends of Oz"" feels like the opposite of the original film. Underneath its aggressive distractions and dim ideas it has no heart. 221 MoviesLegends of Oz trailer PLOT Dorothy Gale must save Oz from a new villain The Jester. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING PG (some scary images and mild peril) CAST Voices of Lea Michele Dan Aykroyd Martin Short Kelsey Grammer LENGTH 130 BOTTOM LINE An uninspired sequel with weird characters generic rock songs and none of the original storys heart.

Dorothys Return is not quite Oz-some By Joe Williams joewilliamspost-dispatch.com 314-340-8344 Joe Williams May 8 2014 (...) Jody Mitori China Princess Dorothy Gale and Marshal Mallow from ""Legends of Oz Dorothys Return."" When most of us watch a movie we pay no attention to the men and women behind the curtain. But especially in an animated film there are minions doing the dirty work one frame at a time. They may not be as important as the director the screenwriter and the actors but sometimes the crews handicraft is the most interesting thing in the film.Case in point ""Legends of Oz Dorothys Return."" This musical toon isnt made for anyone old enough to operate a remote control let alone remember the MGM classic but the dubious discount-bin eye candy could keep the chaperones awake.In the books by L. Frank Baum Dorothy returned to Oz several times but none of the stories was set in the 21st century like this one. Dorothy (voice of Lea Michelle) is still living in tornado-plagued Kansas where the good folks are losing their property to an evil bureaucrat (Martin Short). But before Dorothy can save the farm she gets sucked back over the rainbow by those needy nincompoops the Scarecrow (Dan Akyroyd) the Tin Man (Kelsey Grammer) and the Lion (James Belushi). They need her help to defeat the evil Joker (Short) who has imprisoned the good witch Glinda (Bernadette Peters). In Oz Dorothy and Toto acquire a new set of traveling companions to lead them to the Emerald City flightless bird-brain Wiser the Owl (Oliver Platt) gallant candy-man Marshal Mallow (Hugh Dancy) and tiny diva China Princess (Megan Hilty). When they discover that the Yellow Brick Road has been washed away by floods they float down river on Tugg (Patrick Stewart) the only oak tree in the Haunted Forest who isnt still mad at Dorothy about that apple incident from years ago.Of course there are songs by a motley crew of tunesmiths who include Bryan Adams but except for a showstopper tailor-made for Short they dont make much of an impact. Ditto for the script which is woefully lacking in the kind of wisecracks for grown-ups that make the Pixar and ""Shrek"" movies cross-generational hits. Yet if youre old enough to read this and you find yourself at a screening try thinking about the munchkins who worked so hard on the psychedelic scenery. And if counting Plasticine sugarplums doesnt help pass the 88 minutes click your heels and softly repeat ""Theres no place like home.""What ""Legends of Oz Dorothys Return""  Two stars out of four  Rating PG  Run time 128  Content Some mild peril Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

(Clarius Entertainment) Martin Tsai Legends of Oz Dorothys Return is a lackluster animated sequel ""Legends of Oz Dorothys Return"" picks up where L. Frank Baums ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" (and Victor Flemings 1939 live-action adaptation ""The Wizard of Oz"") left off. But the new 3-D animation feels like a formulaic knockoff of the original replacing most everything whimsical about its predecessor with inane surrogates.Dorothy (voiced by Lea Michele) has traded Scarecrow (Dan Aykroyd) Tin Man (Kelsey Grammer) and Lion (Jim Belushi) for Wiser the plump owl (Oliver Platt) Marshal Mallow (Hugh Dancy) China Princess (Megan Hilty) and Tugg the tree (Patrick Stewart) as her travel companions. The warlock Jester (Martin Short) vows to avenge the death of his sister the Wicked Witch of the West just as she did for the Wicked Witch of the East in the original. ""Over the Rainbow"" has been supplanted by some throwaway number about teamwork courtesy of Bryan Adams. Whatever the shortcomings inherent in ""Dorothy of Oz"" they are only exacerbated here by sweatshop animation cringeworthy ditties and a DreamWorks-influenced wisecracking screenplay by Adam Balsam and Randi Barnes that undermines the story at almost every turn.In the original ""Oz"" Scarecrow Tin Man and Lion yearned for a brain a heart and the nerve. But in this ""Legends of Oz"" based on a book by Baums great grandson Roger S. Baum Dorothys pals have no such lofty desires. The same can be said about the film itself.

Daily Edition Login to download Legends of Oz Dorothys Return Film Review 347 PM PDT 5/7/2014 by Michael Rechtshaffen FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Courtesy of PR This animated road back to Oz makes for a colorful if noisily peripatetic journey. TWITTER Lea Micheles Dorothy is summoned back to Oz in this 3D computer animated sequel also featuring Dan Aykroyd Martin Short and Kelsey Grammer. A 3D animated adventure that essentially picks up where the 1939 classic left off (as opposed to last years live action prequel Oz The Great and Powerful) Legends of Oz Dorothys Return is visually energetic but tonally all over the Yellow Brick Road map. Although it makes a conscious attempt to contemporize the venerable tale--mainly by amping up the characters and the volume--while still incorporating the classic touchstones that have made the original one of the most iconic movies of all time the desired Oz-mosis never occurs. Instead its a loud Oz hodgepodge that never adheres to a prevailing tone long enough to allow viewers to emotionally engage with those characters in spite of some admittedly inspired CG flourishes. STORY Lea Michele Darren Criss Help Raise 700000 for UCLA Cancer Center With its buoyant cast providing the voices led by Lea Micheles spirited Dorothy the Clarius Entertainment release could charm younger audiences but some of those louder darker sequences might prove too intense for pre-schoolers. While youll find the name Baum on the source material--in this case it refers to author L. Frank Baums great grandson Roger Stanton Baum a former stockbroker who has written a series of books under the More Adventures of Oz umbrella. Barely having time to assess the considerable devastation rendered by that fateful twister Dorothy is once again summoned from Kansas back to Oz (courtesy of a Rainbow Mover) by her old pals the Scarecrow (Dan Aykroyd) the Tin Man (Kelsey Grammer) and the formerly cowardly Lion (Jim Belushi). It seems the devious frantic Jester (Martin Short) has turned the key denizens of Oz including beloved Glinda (Bernadette Peters) into his literal puppets in his quest to carry out the unfinished business of his late sister The Wicked Witch of the West. With Dorothys old travel mates among the Jesters fresh conquests she and Toto team with an obese Owl named Wiser (amusingly voiced by Oliver Platt) the squishy Marshal Mallow (Hugh Dancy) and the delicate China Princess (Megan Hilty) in her fresh trek to Emerald City. Along the way they sing some truly forgettable songs penned by the likes of Bryan Adams and longtime writing partner Jim Vallance and Tift Merritt. STORY Warner Bros. Wins 2.57 Million Ruling Over Wizard of Oz Merchandise Animation veterans Daniel St. Pierre who doubles as production designer and Will Finn work hard to be all things to all generations--constantly switching modes from bright and bouncy to shrill and manic to soft and poignant with each shift of gears making an awkward transition. The bumpy ride is especially noticeable during those bookended sequences back in a modern day Kansas where the effects of the tornado are portrayed with a degree of realism that feels jarringly out of place with the rest of the production. That absence of a unifying mood also extends to a script credited to Adam Balsam (Murphy Brown) and Randi Barnes (George of the Jungle)  which like the Scarecrows straw-stuffed limbs seldom finds a firm footing in that hyper-imaginative world that is Oz.

Bill Goodykoontz USA TODAY NETWORK 1051 a.m. MST May 8 2014Theres nothing wrong with a sequel to ""Oz"" as L. Frank Baum wrote several himself. But this one is uninspired and lacks the magic of the most-familiar version.A scene from the animated film Legends of Oz Dorothys Return.

If ""Legends of Oz Dorothys Return"" is any indication it might have been nice to stick around the farm for a while.Theres nothing wrong with a sequel to ""The Wizard of Oz"" as L. Frank Baum wrote several ""Oz"" books in addition to the original. This latest film directed by Will Finn and Dan St. Pierre is based on a book by Roger S. Baum Franks great-grandson so theyre keeping it in the family.But with the Scarecrow (voice of Dan Aykroyd) Tin Man (Kelsey Grammer) and Lion (James Belushi) on the shelf for most of the movie unimaginative animation and a story that just isnt that compelling theres simply no good reason for another trip down the yellow-brick road.MAY MOVIES Avoid the heat and take a seat in theatersLea Michele provides the voice for Dorothy who is back with Uncle Henry and Aunt Em after the tornado and her adventures in Oz. The county is a mess with lots of storm damage and a shady insurance appraiser (Martin Short) is going around condemning everyones property.Dorothy smells a rat but shes needed in Oz where much time has passed. There is some explanation about the different passage of time in Oz and on earth but it makes about as much sense as the rainbow transporter that brings Dorothy back to Oz. (Oddly life in Kansas seems to be set much closer to the present time.)Soon Dorothy is back and the evil Jester (Short again) is wreaking havoc after having stolen the Wicked Witch of the Wests broom turning all of Ozs leading citizens into marionettes and encasing them in glass. Meanwhile the Emerald City has lost its luster.Cue the new characters like Marshal Mallow (Hugh Dancy) a soldier; Wiser (Oliver Platt) an owl so fat he can no longer fly; and Tugg (Patrick Stewart) a tree who becomes a boat. (Tugg. Get it? Yeah.)The group must work together to help Dorothy defeat the Jester and if that sounds a lot like the plot of ""The Wizard of Oz"" well its certainly similar. Its just not nearly as well done.INTERVIEW All in the family Another Baum takes on OzTo be fair not much is. And thats what is so tricky about trying to continue a story that was pretty much perfect. Yes Baum himself did it and more power to him. But ""Legends of Oz Dorothys Return"" lacks any sense of magic. These wont be songs youll find yourself singing over and over after youve left the theater or a movie youll be watching again and again.

( Summertime Entertainment) BY Jordan Hoffman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday May 8 2014 213 PM Title Legends of Oz Dorothys Return Film Info Classic characters are sullied in an uninspired ripoff (128). PG Mild peril. Area theaters. In 3-D where available. This crass cheap hack-job cash-grab is partly based on a book by the grandson of original ""Oz"" author L. Frank Baum. Dorothy is voiced by ""Glee"" star Lea Michele whos no Judy Garland. The farmgirl heroine -- rendered in a lifeless digital-animation style that makes Taiwanese news recaps look good -- is summoned back to Emerald City by Scarecrow (Dan Aykroyd) Tin Man (Kelsey Grammer) and Lion (Jim Belushi) to defeat the evil Jester (Martin Short). Its been years since her last visit though thanks to magical-world logic its just ""the next day"" in Kansas. Which should be the 1930s not the present day it seems to be. The Tin Man (Kelsey Grammer) Cowardly Lion (Jim Belushi) and Scarecrow (Dan Aykroyd) in Legends of Oz Dorothys Return ( Summertime Entertainment) Patrick Stewart voices a new character Tugg while Bernadette Peters chirps up as Glinda. Bad puns and even worse pop songs lead to a boring battle for Oz. This film is loud ugly disrespectful to the spirit of the classic original and far too simplistic for all but the youngest kids. Avoid any brick roads that lead to it.

A scene from ""Legends of Oz Dorothys Return."" Photo Clarius Entertainment Legends of Oz Dorothys Return review third act missing 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Legends of Oz Dorothys Return Animated musical. Starring the voices of Martin Short Patrick Stewart Lea Michele and Megan Hilty. Directed by Will Finn and Dan St. Pierre. (PG. 88 minutes.) ""Legends of Oz Dorothys Return"" returns the heroine who inspired a billion Halloween costumes back to the yellow brick road - this time in search of a plot. The long journey is filled with action and familiar characters but ultimately falls short of success. All the brains heart and courage in the world cant save a movie that doesnt have a third act. The animated film is based on ""Dorothy of Oz"" by Frank L. Baums great-grandson Roger S. Baum. It never approaches the subtle beauty or emotional pull of the 1939 film despite attempts to repeat some of the magic with musical numbers. Its possible that someone will some day write or perform a better song for a film than ""Over the Rainbow."" Its less likely Bryan Adams or Lea Michele will be part of that equation. The sequel begins with the Scarecrow Tin Man and Cowardly Lion panicking about the state of Emerald City where beloved Oz figures have been turned into puppets. They send a rainbow to Kansas that can teleport Dorothy who is dealing with a post-tornado eviction. The animation in this scene and several others after it looks like something from a cereal commercial. ""Legends of Oz"" isnt completely without merit or effort. The art direction and production design are solid creating an imaginative landscape that is often worthy of the Oz label. Chivalrous marshmallow soldier Marshal Mallow (voiced by Hugh Dancy) and the high-maintenance China Princess (Megan Hilty) offer some pleasantly trippy Baum-style weirdness. But the familiar heroes and primary villain display little depth. The most grating newcomer is antagonist the Jester voiced by Martin Short who must have been paid in cases of Rockstar energy drink. He isnt particularly menacing and theres no pathos accompanying the character either. The Jester is just another obstacle. A shouting hyper unpleasantly manic obstacle. The animation is disappointing in ""Legends of Oz"" with filmmakers often choosing dull contrast-free tones. Repetitive action inspires the lazy feeling one gets while watching someone else play a video game. The bland visual depiction does Michele no favors capturing almost none of the spunky or compassionate qualities of Dorothy. Even Toto seems lacking in depth as if hed just jumped off a ""Legends of Oz"" lunch box. After a few entertaining diversions along the way the ending is a disaster piling on visual distractions before wrapping everything up in a too-tidy bow. There was sadness and hope when Dorothy returned to tornado-ravaged Kansas at the finish of the original ""Wizard"" to face a possibly bleak future surrounded by loved ones. ""Legend of Oz"" drops a house on that perfect ending with an oversimplified and painfully scripted fight against con men trying to condemn Dorothys family home. ""Legends of Oz"" may have some deeply hidden charms. We still havent watched it cued up to Pink Floyds ""Dark Side of the Moon."" Mostly the film reaffirms how hard it is to make a movie as unforgettable and enduring as ""The Wizard of Oz."" Good chance youll forget this one on the way home from the theater.

One star Sid (John Leguizamo) meets a female sloth (Jessie J) in ""Ice Age Collision Course."" Stephanie Merry writes ""Ice Age Collision Course"" the fifth installment in the 14-year-long saga of animated prehistoric animals will with any luck also be the last. Lazy scattershot and excruciatingly unfunny the movie is a hazard to the very young who might come away with the erroneous impression that movies dont get any better than this."" Read the full review. Blue Sky Studios/Twentieth Century Fox Film Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. By Jen Chaney May 8 2014 Follow chaneyj When L. Frank Baum invented the land of Oz he created a place that would be remembered forever for its Munchkins winged monkeys the magical green sheen of Emerald City and its capacity to generate book Broadway television and movie spinoffs for as long as the Earth exists -- and possibly even after it hurtles into the universe and lands abruptly on the Wicked Witch of East Mars. As anyone with even rudimentary knowledge of the ruby slipper genre is aware those spinoffs have always varied wildly in terms of quality. On the movie side of things alone ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" has spawned films that are exquisite and cherished (the 1939 classic of the same name) retroliciously funky (1978s ""The Wiz"") largely forgettable (1985s ""Return to Oz"") and narratively empty works of 3-D beauty (last years ""Oz The Great and Powerful""). Now along comes ""Legends of Oz Dorothys Return"" which manages to be animated in form but completely listless in content. This is a musical that borrows tangentially from some of the most imaginative source material in the history of childrens stories and weaves elements of that material into a tale with zero stakes and a troubling tendency to make Scarecrow say such things as ""Copy that"" and ""Secure the chamber"" ""Legends of Oz Dorothys Return"" is adapted most directly from ""Dorothy of Oz"" -- a 1989 novel by Baums great-grandson Roger S. Baum -- that cherrypicks various characters and settings from the original ""Oz"" series and tosses them into a story that again requires Dorothy to save the merry old land from the forces of wickedness. This time that wickedness is disseminated by the Jester (voiced in the movie by Martin Short) the Wicked Witch of the Wests brother whose reign of terror involves turning beloved leaders from all corners of the land including Glinda the good (Bernadette Peters) into his metaphorical and literal marionettes. (Note to parents This movie may induce a severe fear of puppet shows in very young children.) The only person capable of stopping the Jester is Dorothy a fact made abundantly clear by the constantly reiterated but never fully supported contention that ""Dorothy Gale is the only person who can save us"" Whats wrong with ""Legends of Oz Dorothys Return""? Lets ease on down a list of missteps 1. Its cast features some fantastic vocal talents including ""Glees"" Lea Michele as Dorothy and Megan Hilty as the China Princess but most of the movies original songs a couple of which were co-penned by Bryan Adams are like weak-tea versions of soundtrack singles from subpar Disney movies. ""Even Then"" which gives Michele Hilty and Hugh Dancy as Marshal Mallow (hes a marshal made out of marshmallows obviously) is the truly lovely standout. The rest of them? Lets just say the film could have er let them go and they wouldnt have been missed. 2. Speaking of fantastic talents Peters lends her voice to this movie . . . and she doesnt get a single solo. Honestly she got to show off her singing abilities more effectively in 1979s ""The Jerk."" 3. Everything about ""Legends of Oz"" looks and feels flat even through a pair of 3-D glasses. The CGI animated people in particular often appear oddly inhuman instead of realistically expressive. Dorothys Aunt Em and Uncle Henry for example look like they got lost in Kansas on their way to clock in for their regular jobs in ""The Sims 3."" 4. Finally while this 88-minute tale about a little girl in a blue jumper is hardly a harmful choice for kids its painful to think that for some of them ""Dorothys Return"" will serve as their initial big-screen introduction to Oz. That shouldnt be. Every child deserves to see Oz for the first time the way God or at least MGM intended via the opening of a door in a sudden pop of Technicolor gloriousness with a wide-eyed Judy Garland as their guide to a place where Dorothy Gale becomes a hero -- not because everyone keeps saying shes one but because she discovers that her bravery has been buried inside her all along.

"Legends of Oz Dorothys Return Review Back Down the Yellow-Brick Road | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review Legends of Oz Dorothys Return Justin Chang Chief Film Critic JustinCChang 15 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr May 7 2014 | 0351PM PT This kid-friendly 3D toon musical offers another joyless trip down the yellow-brick road. There are more credited producers than there are Munchkins in ""Legends of Oz Dorothys Return"" a kid-friendly 3D toon musical that offers another joyless trip down the yellow-brick road after last years ""Oz the Great and Powerful."" Certainly the hit success of that Disney live-action tentpole may explain why this independent venture is getting a wide release despite its merely passable animation and a story that feels straight-to-video through and through. Banking on audience affection for MGMs classic ""The Wizard of Oz"" (but remaining within acceptable legal boundaries of course) while cooking up a comparatively feeble set of adventures for Dorothy Toto and friends this first theatrical outing for Clarius Entertainment will likely melt away at the box office before finding a small pot of ancillary gold at the end of the rainbow. Since the publication of its beloved first installment in 1900 L. Frank Baums 14-book Oz cycle has spawned any number of authorized and unauthorized sequels alternative legends and revisionist histories; these include 1989s ""Dorothy of Oz"" which was written by the authors great-grandson Roger Stanton Baum and provides the rough outline for Randi Barnes and Adam Balsams screenplay. Visually and iconographically however its clear enough from the films pink-clad Glinda (voiced by Bernadette Peters who sounds heavily sedated) and green-skinned Wicked Witch of the West (making a brief posthumous appearance) that ""Legend of Oz Dorothys Return"" is leaning heavily on the 1939 Victor Fleming-directed original -- a movie that looms so large in the American cultural imagination its the reason why so many of these subpar knockoffs exist and also the reason why they shouldnt. There are key differences to be sure This Dorothy Gale sings not in the creamy tones of Judy Garland but rather in the slick pop-diva register of ""Glees"" Lea Michele. Our heroine has also surrendered her ruby slippers for brown-and-blue cowgirl boots a less flashy but more practical choice of footwear for her long journey back to the Emerald City where the Scarecrow (voiced by Dan Aykroyd) the Tin Man (Kelsey Grammer) and the no-longer-cowardly Lion (James Belushi) are in desperate need of her help The Jester (Martin Short) the devious younger brother of the Wicked Witch of the West has found a way to turn his sisters broomstick into an all-powerful magic scepter and is laying waste to Oz realm by realm brick by yellow brick. ""Oh Toto this doesnt look like the Oz I remember"" Dorothy murmurs at one point. Truer words were never spoken. With the Scarecrow strenuously trying to think his way out of the situation and the Tin Man and Lion basically reduced to bromantic bickering (""Sounds like somebody needs an oil change"") its not long before the three companions have fallen into the Jokers (er Jesters) clutches. Meanwhile Dorothy and Toto make a new friend in Wiser (Oliver Platt) an oversized owl who cant fly (didnt we see this in ""Rio""?) and slowly make their way to the Emerald City by way of some of Ozs lesser-known higher-rent districts including Dainty China Country and Candy Country (didnt we see this in ""Wreck-It Ralph""?). These two detours do allow for one of the pictures few genuinely touching moments in which the chivalrous Marshal Mallow (Hugh Dancy) rather than searching for Sugar Woman courts and woos the haughty China Princess (Megan Hilty back in Oz again after her superb stage performance as Glinda in ""Wicked""). And as this sort of hackneyed fantasy-land mashup goes ""Legends of Oz Dorothys Return"" at least looks more competent than a tonal and technical disaster like ""Hoodwinked Too Hood vs. Evil."" As overseen by directors Will Finn and Daniel St. Pierre the visuals here may be scrappy and derivative but they wont leave your eyeballs screaming for mercy and the 3D while hardly essential to the experience has been applied with a judicious hand. Much of this is watchable; virtually none of it is memorable. The humdrum songs go in one ear and out the other. There are noisy battle scenes lessons in friendship and teamwork and enough second-rate puns and wisecracks to test the voice casts collective patience (although Short seems to be in his element). And in perhaps the most tiresome bit of borrowing from ""The Wizard of Oz"" Dorothys quest here is mirrored by a lazy framing device set in Kansas immediately following the cyclone disaster that blew her to Oz the first time. When Dorothy woke up the first time it was a glorious cinematic testament to the power of dreams; when she does the same here its a glum reminder that you really cant go home again.

Trudi says May 16 2014 at 1208 pm Cmon Grandma You just cut and pasted your comment from screenrant.com (and who knows where else). And the whole ""There will always be a rainbow when one needs it most"" quote... At the end of that rainbow do you think there will be a pot of gold waiting for the thousands of people who invested in this clunker? Reply 76 yr old Grandma says May 15 2014 at 1213 pm Ok First the Wizard of Oz book by Frank Baum amp; Julie Garland in the Wizard of Oz film is classic amp; timeless ~ one thats watched time amp; again by each generation. The Legends of Oz animated musical film is delightful and charming. It remains to be seen how the kids will react amp; whether the film stands the test of time. I say that because we [the writer and several of her grand-mother or older gal friends] attended an afternoon show amp; there were No children watching the film -only about 1 dozen attendees. The gals amp; I LOVED the animation amp; melodious musicality of the movie It will catch on amp; there should be lots of children seeing it this weekend. The music by Bryan Adams songwriter/composer pinned for the film is Great -- I think the kids will particularly like the song amp; animation of the Happy song ""Work with Me"" amp; of course the journey through Candyland will be loved by the kids. The animation process amp; effects for the characters of Oz (i.e. Tin Man monkeys) are amazing. I enjoyed listening to the talented singing voice of Lea Micheles amp; she really got into the role of Dorothys character. This grownup Loved/enjoyed the wonderful stellar talented voices of Megan Hilty amp; Hugh Dancy both in their solo performances amp; as the China Princess amp; Marshall Mallow singing their Beautiful duet song Even Then.~ sigh -) Martin Short really shines as the Jester dont you think; amp; kudos go to the costume designing for the Jester -- Patrick Stewart is also great amp; appealing to the little ones as Tugg the Tugboat The gals thought the movie was very cute amp; well suited for young children to see -- lots of laughs amp; chuckles made in the journey through candyland -- all of them will tell their kids to take their grandchildren to see it. Personally (amp; at my suggestion) we All agreed over cups of Hot Tea to give it an A+ on being a positive role model with high marks in educational values to be discussed w/the kids. Some of the values we talked about were 1) the good Vs evil; the ""work with me"" attitude in helping one another 2) a reiteration of helping those in need of a brain(education); of courage amp; heart (scarecrow/lion/tin man) amp; 3) it connects the dots to people in Dorothys Kansas; e.g. the Jester amp; the appraiser abusing governmental powers et al. One reservation perhaps could be for parents to be cautious about their young 3 to 4 YOs seeing the film ~ the mean flying monkeys battle in 3D might be too scary for them. Although the Top Box Office attendance stats were not as great as other films at this point (about 3.7M) I do think it will do Very Well especially in DVD sales for home viewing. TOYS I think the Jester Toto Tin Man amp; Marshall Mallow plush toys will do well; amp; I believe the Hotest item will be the fashion Singing Dorothy Doll w/cute cowboy boots et al- especially since she sings the Happy song ""Work with Me"" from the movie. Like Dorothy lets think positive amp; remember ""There Will Always be a Rainbow when One Needs it Most"" Reply Psycho says May 16 2014 at 1055 pm Nobody will ever believe that a 76 year old ""grandma"" posted about the movies deplorable 3.7 million draw at the box office. And why would a random grandmother be interested in selling the idea of tie-in toy merchandise? Nice try though. You really had me going with the ""cup of hot tea"" thing because we all know thats what grandmas drink right? Reply KJ says May 12 2014 at 521 pm Have you not read the books??? Great movie for the age category of 3 to 9 Song and animation held the kids attention throughout the entire movie. Reply Trudi says May 10 2014 at 517 am It is just sad that after 10 years of collecting 100M from investors to make this movie that it is of such poor quality that the investors are unlikely to ever see any returns...but I doubt that was the end goal anyway. Reply Tom says May 8 2014 at 502 pm Justin get a grip its a kids animated movie my kids were at the LA premiere and loved it. Maybe you arent the right guy to review a family movie where parents can sit with their children and not have to hear four letter words or see people naked on the big screen Reply Steve Hane says May 8 2014 at 430 pm I dont understand why you thought the framing device was lazy. There was a tornado it caused damage Dorothy as a young girl was confronted by a very adult reality but she was able to leverage her earnestness and dedication to work to rebuild in spite of the damage in the face of a world that had given up. Then when she returns from her adventure in Oz she is empowered once again and challenges the authority that orders her and her aunt and uncle to give up their home. This is a powerful message for young people and you missed it? Or just dismissed the value of storytelling as lazy. One might just as easily call your review lazy and thoughtless. Reply LOL says May 8 2014 at 118 pm Many of the comments threaded here below this review be insider hacks methinks. Justin Chang always speaks the truth ignore the others. Reply Suki says May 9 2014 at 830 am Nope....Im not an insider hack just a member of the general public. Justin Changs truth isnt everybodys truth and everyone is entitled to their own opinion. If a movie is entertaining to my family especially without feeling the need to resort to four-letter words then its a 5 star movie in my book. Well be seeing it again tonight and Im sure it will be just as entertaining as it was the first time. Reply frank martino says May 8 2014 at 102 pm I actually saw a screening of the film and loved it. My children really loved it and thats all that matters. This film was not made to compete with the classic Wizard of Oz and critics comparing them shows that some critics should leave the judging to the audience and their opinions to themselves. But then why have them employed? Exactly. Story characters and music all get a 5 star rating and a must see this weekend. Reply Suki says May 8 2014 at 1126 am My family and I went to a special screening of this movie and completely 100% disagree with this review. We watched Frozen a couple of days before seeing Legends of Oz and my daughter enjoyed this movie so much more. As a matter of fact she cant stop singing a couple of the songs from the movie This movie was entertaining and funny for adults and children alike and the animation is superb. I have a feeling this critic may have been watching a different movie. Reply Supersonic says May 8 2014 at 952 am This is definitely a future entry for the Nostalgia Critic. Reply Tyler says May 7 2014 at 937 pm Disagree completely with every aspect of this review. I have 4 kids they saw the premiere and all LOVED the movie. It was clean humor for adults and kids(Toy Story-like) and very memorable. In fact theyve been quoting lines from the movie since we saw the Premiere on May 3rd. They loved the music and the animation was spectacular. Disregard everything Justin said if you have kids and a family. Reply Studio West Blog says May 7 2014 at 1016 pm Yeah riiiight. You sound like a studio shill. Reply fsn.rfox says May 7 2014 at 440 pm Reblogged this on Global News Now.

Photo Clarius Entertainment MOVIE REVIEW Legends of Oz Dorothys Return Running time 90 minutes. Rated PG (mild rude humor). At the E-Walk Loews East Village others. James Franco all is forgiven. His woebegotten ""Oz The Great and Powerful is practically a masterpiece compared to this eyeball-gougingly ugly charm-free animated musical sequel which is inexplicably opening in thousands of theaters instead of going direct to video. Scarecrow (voiced by Dan Aykroyd) Cowardly Lion (James Belushi) and Tin Man (Kelsey Grammer) are literally tied up for most of the time with Glinda (Bernadette Peters) trapped in a glass case. This leaves poor Dorothy (Lea Michele) to share a journey and several forgettable songs with the sorry company of Marshal Mallow (Hugh Dancy) Wiser the Owl (Oliver Platt) China Princess (Megan Hilty) and Tug the Tugboat (Patrick Stewart). Based on a book by L. Frank Baums great-grandson ""Legends of Oz focuses on the less-than-scintillating Jester (a frantic Martin Short) devious brother of the late Wicked Witch of the West.

A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Theres that clunky passive title; the credit informing us that the movie is not based on any of L. Frank Baums 40 public-domain Oz books but rather a book by Roger Stanton Baum (who?); and the fact that while it purports to pick up the day after the tornado from The Wizard of Oz Dorothy (Lea Michele) now lives in modern-day Kansas. (The early 2000s anyway judging from the gas prices.)Thats a baffling decision that isnt paid off by anything that follows as the Scarecrow (Dan Aykroyd) uses a rainbow-based kidnapping machine to pull Dorothy back to an Oz that has been taken over by the Wicked Witchs brother the Jester (Martin Short at his shoutiest).Film Details Legends of Oz Dorothys Return RatingPG GenreAnimation Running Time87 More Info Trailer Legends of Oz Dorothys Return fails to make us care about the characters or their journeys and the animation is shoddy and occasionally creepy -- particularly Dorothys aunt and uncle who fall on the wrong side of the Uncanny Valley.Kids today deserve better than this and if theyre hankering for a Wizard of Oz sequel that captures the adventure of the original while respecting their intelligence skip this and show them Walter Murchs Return to Oz instead.
