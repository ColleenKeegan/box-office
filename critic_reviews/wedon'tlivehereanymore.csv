Jack (Mark Ruffalo) and Hank (Peter Krause) both teach English at a college in a small peaceful New England town; in many respects their lives are similar but their wives are very different Terry (Laura Dern) is volatile and as Jack often feels moved to point out not the most efficient of housekeepers whereas Edith (Naomi Watts) seems calm confident and capable of keeping a home quiet enough for Hank to write. They are all close friends however and hang out together whenever babysitters are available - until Jack and Edith embark on an affair at which point guilt anxiety suspicion resentment recrimination and revenge begin to take their toll on all four... As scripted by Larry Gross the film offers an unusually balanced and insightful look at an emotional maelstrom less concerned with any notions of right or wrong than with exploring the bewildering blend of contradictory feelings and thoughts that can give rise to or result from infidelity. All four central performances are notable for their courage and expertise and some scenes attain a ferocious intensity as they reveal the characters capacity to hurt one another. Strong stuff then and one of the most mature movies to emerge from America this year.

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

Its an appropriate beginning for a movie thats essentially a melancholy change-partners dance and a reflection on two marriages gone stale. And that choreography is given grace by four splendid actors each of whom contributes a rich portrait of a troubled husband or wife who looks at the head on the other pillow and wonders where things went wrong. As we gradually sort out the players (Curran and screenwriter Larry Gross wisely let us wonder for a while whos married to whom) the films mood of simmering painful honesty takes shape. Jack Linden (Mark Ruffalo) is a literature professor at a New England college. He and his wife Terry (Laura Dern) have had a longtime friendship with writing professor Hank Evans (Peter Krause) and his wife Edith (Naomi Watts) -- meals and movies glasses of wine and companionable talks while the kids play in the next room. But this two-couple friendship is infinitely more complicated than those cozy dinners would indicate. Jack and Edith are having an affair; Terry suspects but isnt sure; Hank knows but obsessed with his own problems (hes got writers block and has grown emotionally distant from his wife) doesnt much care. Movie review Showtimes  ""We Dont Live Here Anymore"" with Mark Ruffalo Laura Dern Peter Krause Naomi Watts Sam Charles Haili Page Jennifer Bishop. Directed by John Curran from a screenplay by Larry Gross based on the short stories ""We Dont Live Here Anymore"" and ""Adultery"" by Andre Dubus. 103 minutes. Rated R for sexual content and language. Seven Gables Uptown. Curran zigzags from Jack and Terrys messy home to Hank and Ediths perfectly ordered one contrasting two very different paired lives. Terry desperately trying to regain control of her household wants to create a life more like the calm Evanses -- she attacks the laundry offers lobster dinners tries to smooth out the disorder. But she and Jack always seem to end up shouting at each other -- her face tear-streaked her frightened eyes indicating that what shes looking for is lost for good. ""Other husbands"" she tells Jack heartbreak in her voice ""touch their wives."" Meanwhile Hank and Edith barely speak living quietly side-by-side. And the four form other pairings. Jack and Hank take jogs together chasing each other (or so it seems) on a wooded trail and hoist a few beers afterward talking in circles about love. (Hank played with angry detachment by Krause enjoys playing games with Jack never quite letting the other man know that he knows about the affair.) Terry and Ediths friendship continues with an unspoken strain. And Hanks eyes finally do land on Terry leading to the final steps in the dance. ""We Dont Live Here Anymore"" is a very talky movie and occasionally an oddly dated one. (The Andre Dubus stories on which its based date from the 70s and while the movies settings and costumes feel contemporary there are a few anachronisms most notably the burning of a manuscript. Wouldnt it be backed up on a disk somewhere?) But its performances stay with you -- particularly Watts angelic expression when she tells Jack ""If I didnt love you Id have to love somebody else"" Ruffalos sheepish smile as he finds not-quite-amusement at something that isnt there and most of all Derns ravaged face and emptied-out despair. The Evans and Linden marriages may be fatally ill but the art of screen acting is alive well and cause to celebrate.

Starring Mark Ruffalo Laura Dern Peter Krause and Naomi Watts. Directed by John Curran. (R. 104 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""We Dont Live Here Anymore"" is a movie for adults of a kind that usually isnt made in America a film whose only purpose is to delve into human passions and emotions. Specifically its about infidelity and its effect on two families in a small college town. Adapted from two stories by the late Andre Dubus  its a film of sexy trysts slash-and-burn arguments and unexpected flashes of humor. The acting is fervent and the insights cut deep. Americans may not often film this kind of story and yet ""We Dont Live Here Anymore"" is refreshingly distinctly American. Unlike every Continental film about adultery it tells its story without the raised eyebrow without cynicism. Sex is serious. Infidelity brings guilt. A sense of responsibility hangs over the characters particularly Mark Ruffalo as Jack who initiates an affair with his best friends wife Edith (Naomi Watts). To spend 10 minutes with Jack is to know his mental loop his wondering which woman to be with which one he loves and whats to be done about the kids. Its to see a harrowing example of someone who doesnt know himself. Jack is married to Terry played by Laura Dern who feels her husbands drift from her but has no evidence of his infidelity. Something of a drinker and emotionally out of control her mode is to lash out make accusations and apologize later. The least intellectual of the spouses Terry has the humility to think she might be imagining things and she has the motive to doubt herself too -- she loves her husband. Their arguments are painful to watch because shes really trying to communicate and hes just trying to confuse her. The Jack-Terry arguments can almost exhaust an audience making viewers feel as if theyre stuck in that marriage too. But they have the ring of truth The spouses see the arguments before they arrive and yet they stand there and let them happen. They argue about everything including things theyre not really concerned about. And by next morning theres a truce but its entirely a function of exhaustion and proximity not reconciliation. By contrast Edith and her husband Hank (Peter Krause) never argue but then they dont really talk. Like Jack Hank teaches in the college but unlike Jack he is also a writer. Caught up in his own inner life he assumes a blithe facade in his daily existence a benign face on what is really a rather chilly indifference. He doesnt have much to offer a wife who as played by Watts is a woman of vivacity and intelligence just coming into her own power. So why shouldnt Jack and Edith get together? They make a sexy couple and the fireworks they make are the only sparks in their dreary existence. Who could blame them? And yet we do blame them and they blame themselves. Their passion can only relieve itself. Scenes with their respective children -- kids are usually avoided in adultery movies but not in this one -- are painful with each parent suddenly feeling like an impostor someone obliged to assume a cheerful demeanor even the kids world is being undermined. Hemingway wrote that ""All things truly wicked start from an innocence."" In ""We Dont Live Here Anymore"" the characters share an innocent belief in the right to pursue happiness and the equally naive expectation that such a state is their due. Out of this faith comes cruelty and emotional perversity. Often the characters dont even know whats driving them. But we do. Its one of the great pleasures offered by this movie the privileged view into extreme human behavior. The direction by John Curran is superior not only for the uniform strength and subtlety of the performances but also for the way Curran juggles the perspectives of all the spouses. Part of the credit goes to Larry Gross for his intelligent screenplay. But its also a function of editing. Curran is constantly flashing for two or three seconds at a time either to show what someone is thinking or to let us see what is happening concurrently in the other household. The possibilities for such intercutting are almost infinite. Curran chooses his moments well. Also notable is the sound design full of echoes and mystical chords that create the sense that in these specific lives something is playing out both universal and inexpressibly sad. -- Advisory This film contains strong language and simulated sex.

""I think this might be a good time for me to go to the movies"" Hank (Peter Krause) announces to the two folks who have been cuckolding him just as they sit down at Jacks dining room table for a little heart-to-heart. Funny I was thinking the same thing. Mark Ruffalo from left Peter Krause Naomi Watts and Laura Dern play two unhappy adulterous couples in John Currans gut-wrenching drama ""We Dont Live Here Anymore."" (Kimberly French -- Warner Independent Pictures) _____More in Movies_____  We Dont Live Here Anymore Details  Watch the Trailer  Latest Movie Releases  Arts amp; Living Movies _____Free E-mail Newsletters_____  News Headlines  News Alert Not that I wanted to leave. Far from it. Not when it was just starting to get good. (Hank to make matters worse is sleeping with Jacks wife Terry played by Laura Dern). Its just that this exquisitely awkward moment didnt feel like a movie to me. Rather it felt like I was in the dining room with these people experiencing every cringing squirming beat like some kind of invisible voyeur. Yup its that good. Or that bad depending on your appetite for this sort of feel-bad drama. Myself I loved almost every minute of its psychologically and emotionally raw story of betrayal and healing adapted by screenwriter Larry Gross from two short stories by Andre Dubus whose work also inspired the great and equally gut-wrenching ""In the Bedroom."" Mind you I said almost every minute. I could have used a little less of what felt like director John Currans overly ominous focus on train tracks and hurtling white water. At times it seems certain that someone is about to get run over by a Metroliner or fall into the river and drown. As the husband of another critic put it after a recent screening ""Theres enough real horror here without adding fake horror."" Hes got that right. When Jack a college literature professor teaching Tolstoys ""The Death of Ivan Ilyich"" (symbolism alert) informs his wife that he loves Edith it feels less like a declaration of affection for another than a head-on blow meant to injure his spouse. And yet theres something strangely appropriate about Currans attention to the features of a threatening landscape particularly to railroad crossing gates the first of which descend portentously only a few minutes into the film when it is clear that Jack and Edith are about to embark on their out-of-control affair (which in turn precipitates the one between Hank and Terry.) Why do these people cheat? Lust to be sure but also a desire to punish their spouses for their own unhappiness. ""We Dont Live Here Anymore"" is not however a morality tale. True to its metaphorical title its actually more than a geography lesson -- one whose subject is the shifting terrain of two broken drifting marriages. Lines are crossed; people venture into the woods -- literally and figuratively -- only to get lost. In this film which is as harrowing a horror story as they come one couple might make it out of that scary forest and one might not. Far be it from me to call ""We Dont Live Here Anymore"" optimistic yet theres a ray of hope shining through all the gathering darkness that feels a little bit like the kind of lesson that can be learned only at the school of hard knocks. In the process the movie may leave its audience feeling a little battered (some might say betrayed) as well. Still the films honesty along with its refusal to pander to Hollywood happy endings is well worth the beating.

Youre glad when either of them -- the marriage or the movie -- is over. Adapted from two short stories by truth-teller Andre Dubus the movie is about adultery among the assistant professoriate. It gets the incidental anthropology perfectly the messy Arts and Crafts bungalows crammed with books and wine bottles where our characters live; and the mismatched clothing worn by people who read Tolstoy but not GQ. Laura Dern left and Naomi Watts play campus wives having affairs with each others husband in ""We Dont Live Here Anymore."" (Photos Kimberly French -- Warner Independent Films Via Reuters) _____More in Movies_____  We Dont Live Here Anymore Details  Watch the Trailer  Latest Movie Releases  Arts amp; Living Movies _____Free E-mail Newsletters_____  News Headlines  News Alert Having evoked effortlessly that world by superb scene and costume design the film then watches as two highly verbal and overly intelligent couples fight cheat regret lie try to pick up the pieces act abominably drink too much and get on with their lives. Watching the movie is like having dinner with two George-and-Marthas from ""Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" and you might ask Why put yourself through it? The answer I suppose is that although the truth hurts (even if its other peoples) its still the truth. Jack amp; Terry amp; Hank amp; Edith -- who could not call them that? -- live somewhere in Washington state and Jack amp; Hank teach in a small colleges creative writing department. Hank (Peter Krause of ""Six Feet Under"") still wants to publish. Jack (Mark Ruffalo) appears to have given up and his writing consists of scrawling the word ""Awkward"" on student manuscripts. The two may be experts on creative writing but they know more about creative loving as each is having an affair with the others wife and though it is unsaid each of the four either knows or suspects the truth. The problem isnt really sex. As Hank says ""Everyone deserves to be happy"" meaning that no one in this menage a quatre appears to begrudge his or her official spouse an unofficial roll in the hay now and then. The problem is love. As Charles Bukowski said love is a dog from hell and its assault pretty much tears these poor folks apart. The most destructive love is Jacks for Hanks wife Edith. Jack wants not just the pleasure of the new body but the lasting joy of finding the soul mate. He no longer loves his wife Terry (Laura Dern) and has given himself over -- the longing looks the trysts in the woods the feeble ever-mounting edifice of lies necessary to sustain the relationship -- entirely to Edith (Naomi Watts) instead. Hank for his part no longer loves Edith or at least no longer desires her because hes upset with his inability to publish. Edith feels distraught at her disconnection from Hank and has thus given herself eagerly to Jack although its unclear whether the sex or the love is more important. Terry is so furious at Jack she has sex with Hank to get even. Oh and they all love their kids. And just to make it all the more tangled they really like each other a lot. Directed by an Australian named John Curran who has only one obscure feature on his resume the film astutely finds a vivid personality for each character. The intricacies of whos mad at whom when and why and who has just slept with whom or planning to sleep with whom might not be worth chronicling in any depth but the characters are. Krauses Hank is the most laid back; hes a man of repose quiet irony and even quieter despair. I dont think he ever raises his voice and his most conspicuous trait is a kind of smug refusal to be surprised by anything the world is capable of conjuring for his ironic examination. Meanwhile Wattss Edith is sexually greedy open funny and strangely untroubled by the situation. Possibly she comes from wealth for her house is much nicer -- Id guess it has been professionally decorated -- and she drives a Mercedes-Benz station wagon that has to be beyond an assistant professors salary. Shes like Daisy Buchanan sloppy and numb without much in the way of self-awareness. Ruffalos Jack is all fidgets and sensitivity. This actor can be annoying in his occasional attempts to out-Sandy Dennis Sandy Dennis but here he keeps his twitchiness the odd pauses and clumsy gropings of his line readings under control. Poor Dern has the least attractive role; her Terry is semi-alcoholic and riven with fury. Her beauty is almost always banished by her anger which clenches her mouth into an eternal sneer out of which pours the most vicious but never unjustified venom. The movie never builds any particular dramatic momentum; like life its anti-dramatic and you know that these marriages probably cant be saved. It drifts toward unsatisfying resolution without the kind of Big Movie Moments so popular in the summer. In the end it merely says This is how it was this is what it felt like this is what happened. Thats more than enough. We Dont Live Here Anymore (104 minutes at Landmark E Street Cinema Landmark Bethesda Row Cinema and Loews Cineplex Georgetown) is rated R for sexual situations and profanity as well as ugly emotional confrontations.

"We Dont Live Here Anymore the miseries of marriage. Slate Sign In Sign Up We Dont Live Here Anymore the miseries of marriage. We Dont Live Here Anymore the miseries of marriage. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Aug. 13 2004 1252 PM Very Unhappy Families About to tie the knot? Skip We Dont Live Here Anymore. By David Edelstein Ruffalo and Dern wedded bliss When it comes to marriage especially marriage with children every couple reinvents the torture wheel. Different people make different sorts of compromises between freedom and responsibility based on different thresholds for shrieking volleys of four-letter words serial infidelity and the other forms of emotional battery that tend to accompany cohabitation. And its a good thing too or American domestic novels would all be the same and the chamber drama We Dont Live Here Anymore (Warner Independent Pictures)--based on two linked novellas by the late Andre Dubus--wouldnt leave you so wrung-out. This is not a movie to see if youre contemplating tying the knot; its a hard slog for those of us already entwined. The film directed by John Curran from a script by Larry Gross revolves around two couples Jack (Mark Ruffalo) and Terry (Laura Dern) and Hank (Peter Krause) and Edith (Naomi Watts). The men are college-English-department academics (with beards) the women stay-at-home moms--probably more common in the academic world of the early 70s when Dubus novellas were written. (The script was written in the 70s but the movie appears to be set in the present.) We Dont Live Here Anymore opens with these two couples somewhat drunk dancing and hanging out in Jack and Terrys kitchen. Then Ruffalos Jack heads off to buy beer with Watts Edith and an awkward sputtering declaration a smooch and a date for a rendezvous signal the start of something big. But Krauses Hank the unpublished novelist isnt oblivious to whats brewing between his wife and best buddy. His own affairs are legion and he might have designs on the miserably forsaken Terry. Advertisement ""Miserably"" is not a word I use lightly here Dern turns Terry into one of the more desperately ragingly neglected spouses in the annals of film. The actress face always mobile now approaches Claymation--especially that wiggly semaphore of a mouth that is constantly collapsing and reforming. Terry thinks that Jack is relentlessly judging her and finding her wanting--and shes not wrong. When Terry sags in defeat the skin on Derns face looks ready to slide into a puddle on the ground and her stringy haggardness is often downright alarming. Its a powerful committed performance (redolent of the actresss own romantic past) but Dern makes Terrys confrontationalism so intensely painful that its no wonder Jack is driven into the arms of Watts relatively cool Edith. Well OK no man would need much of an excuse. Watts is pretty as a clear pond which is not to say she has no depths Shes Sharon Stone with soul. The script by Larry Gross doesnt bring out Ediths inner life. (The second Dubus novella ""Adultery"" is told from her point of view.) But Krauses Hank has the sort of mythic narcissism that makes her affair an act of self-preservation. Hank has that Lord-of-Misrule self-centeredness you see in artists who decide that their work gives them license to do anything They can justify indulging their most selfish and destructive impulses in the name of studying human nature. Its all fodder for fiction right? Hank tells Jack after one of those runs that turn into a macho competition ""Youre too nice to sleep with other women without loving them. Just once try fucking someone because it feels good."" Except that Ruffalos Jack isnt especially ""nice."" Hes always fleeing the mess that is his wife (Terry is a slob) and then criticizing her for that mess. His passivity is another form of torture. He lies in bed pretending to be asleep while downstairs his best friend seduces his wife and then takes sadistic pleasure in letting her know he was awake the whole time. The veteran screenwriter Gross did a sterling job with his underrated exceedingly nasty adaptation of Jim Thompsons exceedingly nasty This World Then the Fireworks (1998). But hes a sensationalist His work has punch but spotty dramatic logic. His adaptation here is quasi-faithful by which I mean he preserves Dubus dialogue but doesnt always keep the right context or speaker. ""Sometimes I think I love you even more than I think I do"" says Ruffalos Jack to Watts Edith after their initial coupling--which doesnt quite scan. In the novella theyve been sleeping together at least a month and it makes a difference Later Edith has a speech about a trip to the zoo how a gorilla crapped into its hand held up the crap so that the human onlookers could see and then licked the crap; and how this was the gorillas way of showing how trapped it was--and by extension how trapped she is. Its a good monologue but in the film it comes when shes still in mid-affair instead of later when that option for release has been choked off. Its too bad the script has the fuzzies because We Dont Live Here Anymore might have been a bad-marriage classic. Its still pretty potent. Films about couples breaking up often build to were-all-gorillas-licking-our-shit metaphors or drunken husband-wife brawls; this one has them from start to finish. Even the lame excuses of the furtive lovers as they head out the door to ""take the car in"" or ""run some errands"" or ""do some work in the library"" hit you like blows--especially when the needy kids are being lied to along with the spouses. Curran made a little-seen (in this country) Australian movie called Praise (1998) When I reviewed it I compared it to Sid amp; Nancy (1986) ""if you took away the violence and satire and melodrama and rock n roll--in other words all the externals--and left only the grasping."" We Dont Live Here Anymore proves that Curran has a taste for grasping and for moving his camera close enough so that the characters pain twists you up but not so close that the actors are violated. The movie is intimate yet jarringly distanced by floating long shots sudden allusive flashbacks and mysterious transitions. The score by Michael Covertino deepens the mystery. In one scene Jacks little daughter watches a moon-walk on TV and the sounds are picked up and carried through the film echoey blips and beeps and disharmonic shimmers like astral winds. Its music for people right on top of one another and yet lost in space. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air.

But the powerful truths within their struggle are captivating. Laura Dern plays the moral center of a complex drama in We Dont Live Here Anymore. Warner Independent Pictures Audiences will be drawn by a kind of uneasy voyeuristic curiosity to the story of this quartet of misguided souls. Because the complexities of married life are so keenly observed and ring so true without preachiness were willing to endure the pain of watching their string of wrong-headed choices. Based on two short stories by Andre Dubus who wrote the similarly dark In the Bedroom the movie focuses on the infidelities of two couples all friends which tear at the fabric of their marriages. It becomes a contest between freedom and responsibility with neither option offering complete salvation. One truth emerges Nothing can be more challenging than making an enduring commitment to another human being. ABOUT THE MOVIE We Dont Live Here Anymore    1/2 (out of four) Stars Laura Dern Naomi Watts Mark Ruffalo Peter Krause Director John Curran Distributor Warner Independent Pictures Rating R for sexual content and language Opens Friday in New York and Los Angeles Jack (Mark Ruffalo) a passive-aggressive college professor is married to Terry (Laura Dern) a headstrong mother of two young children who struggles with the banal requirements of running a household. Their passion has cooled replaced by disillusionment and annoyance. As chaotic and disheveled as Jack and Terrys lives are their best pals Hank (Peter Krause) and Edith (Naomi Watts) live in immaculate almost sterile tidiness. Hank is a womanzing writer and Edith is his distant moneyed wife. They have a quiet young daughter who seems to exist in her own world. Indeed all of the children in this drama seem sadly incidental to the passions of their parents. All four actors put in strong performances but the movie belongs to Dern the moral center of the saga. Her tour-de-force portrayal is marked by such palpable anguish that the angst of the other characters seems almost nonchalant in comparison. We Dont Live Here Anymore is a revelation. One rarely sees American-made movies that are so unafraid to explore emotional cruelty and portray the consequences without positing easy answers or attaching happy endings.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm --Stop what? Such words have been spoken by a billion adulterers back to Lilith and Adam Adam and Eve Eve and Lucifer. The beauty is that when we speak them (and adult life condemns us to either speak these words eventually or choose hard against their being spoken) we do so in the necessary illusion that nothing we do or say has ever been done or said quite this way before. Yet being human means we all breathe the same universal delicious soul-betraying air. The great accomplishment of the new film We Dont Live Here Anymore is that it so freshly and forcefully takes the temperature of such treacheries and heroics. Jack (Mark Ruffalo) is a professor at a rural university enmeshed in an affair with Edith (Naomi Watts) wife of his best friend Hank (Six Feet Unders Peter Krause) a rakish aloof fiction writer who may knowingly have goaded them into getting together. Meanwhile Jacks wife Terry (Laura Dern) looks on in a rage that is by turns vengeful and self-lacerating wavering between Medea-like storms of emotion meant to crack the growing wall between herself and Jack (yet which only drive him away) and the urge to have an affair of her own with Hank (partly for the pleasure in it but mostly to provoke Jack). Writer Larry Gross adapting two stories by Andre Dubus has a great ear for the layers of irony and challenge latent in even the most familiar exchanges. The one quoted above is whispered breathlessly by Jack and Edith when the pair have momentarily escaped their spouses and counterweighted by director John Curran with glimpses of Terry and Hank whove been left behind to float in a serpentine dance with one another. ""How could you leave me with Hank?"" Terry asks Jack later probing him about his phony beer run with Edith. Were snared in a web of intersecting guilts and jealousies Terrys radar regarding Jack is up because shes as tempted to stray as he is while Jacks guilt about fucking Edith rouses in him a jealous obsession with whatever may or may not be brewing between Terry and Hank. These people are so deeply vitally realized that the intricate suspense of We Dont Live Here Anymore is excruciating without being at all ""plotty."" Were on familiar human ground throughout yet the character-driven questions keep burning What will these particular folks do? Jack a passionate reader finds himself mirrored in the prose of Tolstoys The Death of Ivan Ilyich -- not because his death is imminent but because he feels his mortality looming in the scale of the choices hes making an anguish (beautifully enacted by Ruffalo) that culminates in a fierce self-reckoning on an outing with his children. Edith a light sweet-seeming sphinx acts out a secretive struggle in Jacks arms a struggle illuminated with startling clarity by Watts in a single close-up as she evades the gaze of her friend Terry who stands behind her. Its as though Ediths infidelity makes her more real to herself. Hank playing a ghostly game of God with his wife and friends is as Krause embodies him a fascinating absence rather than a person -- a paragon of seductive charisma feeding on itself. Laura Derns Terry is by contrast all presence and as such constitutes Derns fieriest and most mature performance to date. She has always possessed a mouth as expressive as an extra pair of eyes but here it becomes a rictus flashing anger and disappointment at the turns her life has taken. As Gross told a recent audience at the L.A. Film Festival We Dont Live Here Anymore was originally written in the 1970s. That figures in the best sense It is worthy of comparison to the lifelike character-rich films we cherish from that era and is certainly one of the finest films to come out this year.

Its occasionally allowed to be sexy usually muffled by guilt. What films almost never have the daring or sophistication to show is that adultery can be less a violation of life than a desperate deeply urgent expression of it. We Dont Live Here Anymore a wrenchingly intimate drama of marital infidelity is the kind of movie for and about grown-ups that people used to talk about wanting to see but that just about no one makes anymore. Written by Larry Gross who based it on two short stories by Andre Dubus (whose ""Killings"" became ""In the Bedroom"") and directed by John Curran the film is at times harrowing to watch yet its also wry and delicate and absorbing. Its infused with the messy excitement of imperfect passion. Jack (Mark Ruffalo) and Hank (Peter Krause) are 40ish English professors who are enjoying the summer off in their small pastoral college town. The two jog and drink together sharing weary macho confessions yet theyre only half honest; both are stuck in marriages that are quietly dying. As a drunken dinner party winds down it takes us a few minutes to sort out through all the flirting and dancing who is actually married to whom. Jack and his wife the depressed self-medicating Terry (Laura Dern) still need each other yet the pressures of raising a family have ground them into a mutual unhappiness that they acknowledge in occasional screaming matches only to sweep it back under the rug. Hank and Edith (Naomi Watts) by contrast are the picture of smooth functionality only its a false picture He worships their young daughter and devotes himself to writing fiction and poetry yet hes also a poker-faced academic sleaze who has never been faithful. Beaming out of this dark tangle of relationships is a ray of light Jack and Edith are having an affair and its a blissful one - erotic emotional a union of affection and spirit. As they meet up in town then make love in the woods Ruffalo and Watts forge a tender and moving bond even as were lured into the thorny practical intrigue of the characters attempts to arrange an afternoon tryst. Do their spouses know? Its part of the films subtle emotional force to recognize that this extramarital connection while far from the vulgar act of ""wife swapping"" really involves all four people. Its a playing out maybe even an exorcism of their fragile private demons. ""We Dont Live Here Anymore"" doesnt have anything like a conventional story. It ebbs and flows on currents of hope and anger lust and despair and if thats a high-wire way to make a movie Gross and Curran have crafted it with stunning skill. Its the acting however that leaves one breathless. I wont soon forget Ruffalos vulnerability Krauses acerbic self-delusion Watts radiant sadness or the flat-out brilliance of Laura Dern whose face twisted with love and torment becomes an emblem of the movies cathartic honesty.
