"A story that is truly evergreen - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEW A story that is truly evergreenThe adventure continues as Shrek 2 heads into happily ever after.May 18 2004|Kenneth Turan | Times Staff Writer Can an ogre live happily ever after? Can fairy tale characters be content with their fairy tale lives? Can an Oscar-winning animated success generate a successful sequel? To all these questions ""Shrek 2"" is happy to answer yes yes and yes.A key reason for this accomplishment is that so much of the talent of the original has returned to the new ""Shrek"" including one of its directors (Andrew Adamson) two of its writers (Adamson and Joe Stillman) and all three of its vocal stars Eddie Murphy as Donkey Cameron Diaz as Princess Fiona and Mike Myers as Shrek the ogre that walks like a man. These are people who know how to make the trains run on time and run on time they do.The more anonymous heroes of ""Shrek 2"" are the teams of computer animators who make the story come alive on screen. There is something about the computer that seems to set animators free that liberates their enthusiasm and enables them to come up with razzle-dazzle set pieces that are too clever to resist.Which is a good thing because this ""Shrek"" is on the slow side getting started. While the films initial exposition is necessary to set things up it does feel like pro forma business that has to be gotten through before the animators can go wild.After an all-too-brief romantic interlude at Hansels Honeymoon Hideaway newlyweds Shrek and Fiona return home to the swamp only to be confronted with a pair of real-life problems best friend Donkeys refusal to make himself scarce and an invitation from Fionas folks the King and Queen of Far Far Away to Meet the Parents.Though hes a trial to the young marrieds Eddie Murphys irrepressible impossible to discourage beast of burden is the opposite for audiences. As Fiona and Shrek gradually morph into romantic leads Murphys Donkey at least initially carries the comic burden bringing the perfect reading to lines such as ""How about a side of sugar for the steed?""Less enthralling is the initial conflict-with-the-in-laws plot structure. Co-writer/co-director Adamson has said it was inspired by ""Guess Whos Coming to Dinner"" and there is something of the plodding nature of that film in this ones initial exposition.Shrek and the King and Queen (Julie Andrews and John Cleese) who always thought their daughter would marry the photogenic Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) are less than enchanted by Fionas choice of mate and that leads to an equally predictable rift between husband and wife.Fortunately ""Shrek 2"" has two new characters up its sleeve who liven things up considerably -- one a malicious completely insincere fairy godmother (""Absolutely Fabulous "" Jennifer Saunders) whos turned herself into a conglomerate on the Martha Stewart model but is never too busy to do good people an evil turn.Even better is Puss in Boots wonderfully voiced by Antonio Banderas. He goes from Shreks nemesis to his friend from rascally assassin to cute kitty arousing Donkeys jealousy in the process. ""The position of annoying talking animal"" Murphy magisterially announces ""has been taken.""Also gradually kicking in is the films preeminent cleverness which extends from having Far Far Away be a recognizable (albeit medieval) Beverly Hills to showing us (in a parody of ""Cops"") a pepper-spray can that actually sprays pepper.""Shrek 2"" also makes a ton of references to other films and pop culture artifacts. A partial list includes use of Justin Timberlake the Paramount gate Love Potion No. 9 the theme from TVs ""Rawhide"" the surf kiss in ""From Here to Eternity"" and most delicious of all a fairy tale parody of ""Mission Impossible"" with Pinocchio in the leading role.""Shrek 2"" also benefits from more elaborate visuals than the original and some great voice casting including TVs Larry King as the Ugly Stepsister and Tom Waits as a singing Captain Hook. Its cleverness and its good heart enable it to overcome a slow start which is how all good fairy tales end.Shrek 2MPAA rating PG for some crude humor a brief substance reference and some suggestive contentTimes guidelines Some flatulence humorMike Myers...ShrekEddie Murphy...DonkeyCameron Diaz...Princess FionaJulie Andrews...Queen LillianJohn Cleese...King HaroldAntonio Banderas...Puss in BootsRupert Everett...Prince CharmingJennifer Saunders...Fairy GodmotherReleased by DreamWorks Pictures.

This second edition of DreamWorkss Oscar-winning ogre opus may not match the original for well originality but it honors the prime injunction governing sequels To thine own characters be true. And it gets a strong infusion of comic energy from a newcomer Puss In Boots who is voiced by Antonio Banderas and played as a dashing Zorro deterred only by hairballs. Much of the story finds Shrek Princess Fiona and Donkey in a Land Of Far Far Away thats a live ringer for present-day Hollywood complete with Bowl Oscar ceremonies a sun-struck palm-lined thoroughfare called Romeo Drive and Pinocchio doing Tom Cruise in ""Mission Impossible."" Yet theres an old-Hollywood feel to the movies solid showmanship and unabashed sophistication. These days its feature-length toons sporting the newest-fangled technology that take kids and adults alike back to the movies good old days. At the end of the first film Shrek and Fiona had become happy newlyweds notwithstanding his green complexion broadband halitosis and surfeit of ear wax or her reverse-magical transformation from a beautiful royal babe into a cheerfully chubby frumpy ogress. Theyre still happy in ""Shrek 2"" and still voiced by respectively Mike Myers and Cameron Diaz while Eddie Murphy is wonderfully funny once again as the volcanically bumptious Donkey. But a dark cloud soon scuds into view -- an invitation from her parents the King and Queen to a royal ball that will celebrate the union of their presumably radiant daughter with presumably her handsome Prince Charming. If this sounds like a riff on ""Guess Whos Coming To Dinner"" it is that and more. The plot that previously stressed the importance of self-acceptance now expands into the area of plain old acceptance -- what ensues when her parents refuse to accept the monster of a husband she brings home. Viewed objectively the plot doesnt expand very far even if takes some ingenious twists and turns within the boundaries of its source material the classic childrens book by the late William Steig. But I didnt view ""Shrek 2"" objectively and I dont think you will either. At a time when many supposed blockbusters turn out to be demeaning duds DreamWorks has stuffed this sequel full of good gags (the tone is worldly but not oppressively so) and in addition to the hilarious Puss In Boots has matched vivid vocal performances with engaging new characters Rupert Everett as Prince Charming John Cleese as the King Julie Andrews as the Queen and Jennifer Saunders as an extremely untrustworthy Fairy Godmother who flits around like a hovercraft with big hair. Fairy Godmother has a little white dog and at one point I caught myself making a mental note that the dog was computer-generated. The whole movie is computer-generated of course but Id managed to lose sight of that basic fact in my delight with and entire acceptance of a fantasy world with an irresistible pull. The production notes use such arcane terms as bounce shader smooshing system dynamic crowd character and a 3000-processor render farm. All of that translates into steady-state enchantment on a very big screen. Its also worth noting that I saw ""Shrek 2"" at a screening in a theater equipped with digital projection -- no celluloid print traveling through the projector just digital tape turning bits and bytes into beams of uncompromised clarity. Sometimes technology really does live up to its bright promise. Strayed Once in a great while a film seems right in every detail. Andre Techines ""Strayed"" (""Les Egares"") is such a film an austere story of survival at the outset of World War II. And its rightness is enhanced by Agnes Godards lyrical luminous cinematography; its as if Jean Renoir had set ""A Day In the Country"" in a disenchanted forest. ""Strayed"" in French with good English subtitles starts with a panorama of stark terror -- a column of refugees strafed by Nazi Stukas as they flee Hitlers invading hordes. Among them is Odile (Emmanuelle Beart) a young Parisian mother and recent widow with her 13-year-old son Philippe and her 7-year-old daughter Cathy. When their car is destroyed by a bomb Odile and her children take to the woods where they cross paths with a fearless country boy Yvan who seems to possess all of the rough survival skills that Odile lacks. Most of the story plays out in a manor house -- the abandoned home of a cultivated family -- where Odile and her children hide from the Nazis and set up ad hoc housekeeping under Yvans direction. Yet ""Strayed"" goes beyond the practicalities of staying alive in a mortally dangerous situation. (The script by Mr. Techine and Gilles Taurand was adapted from Gilles Perraults novel ""Le Garcon Aux Yeux Gris."") In the complex intensely sensual drama that unfolds the illiterate -- and damaged -- Yvan grows close to Odile first as a sort of unwanted wild child then as a substitute husband whos both threatening and alluring. Yvan is played superbly by Gaspard Ulliel; he gives the boy an appealing bleakness reminiscent of the young Matt Damon and an explosive brusqueness that stands in contrast to Emmanuelle Bearts placid beauty. At first her beauty seems out of place but thats the point. Odile who continues to wear pretty skirts and heels is ill-equipped as most of her countrymen were to cope with the wars brutality. Shes gone off the rails by her own account; she has strayed beyond the limits of her comprehension. But who has strayed farther Odile or Yvan and who saves whom in the end? Mr. Techines film is never simple but its hugely rewarding. Love Me If You Dare ""Love Me If You Dare"" is if nothing else a cure for otherwise incurable Francophilia. Numbingly arch suffocatingly cute Yann Samuells treacly-tart saga of twisted love across the decades combines the perversity of ""Les Liaisons Dangereuses"" the trickiness of ""Amelie"" and an FAO Schwarz aesthetic. The lovers Sophie and Julien live for the excitement of a game they began in childhood -- a compulsive game of dares that drives them to ever more dangerous and destructive pranks. Mr. Samuells stylistic revelries are meant as comments on the conventions and excesses of movie romance but his approach is glib and self-congratulatory. No feelings dwell beneath the layers upon layers of faux-naive artifice. I dare you to sit through this movie and not wish you were somewhere else.    DVD TIP Sometimes its hard to find a good film thats relevant to the main review but this week its a piece of cake. If you want to understand how Antonio Banderas can be so funny and charming as the voice behind a feline consult ""The Mask Of Zorro"" (1998) the movie that provided the superhero-cum-buffoon model for Puss In Boots. Earlier in his career Mr. Banderas had done one remarkable comedy after another with the Spanish director Pedro Almodovar among them ""Matador"" ""Law of Desire"" and the peerless ""Women On the Verge Of A Nervous Breakdown."" But he seemed hopelessly lost in the thickets of Hollywood. Then along came ""The Mask Of Zorro"" which Martin Campbell directed from a smart witty script by John Eskow and the writing team of Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio. Messrs. Elliott and Rossio also wrote the script for ""Shrek"" and were ""creative consultants"" on ""Shrek 2.""

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet One reason so few fairy tales have sequels is that once the story gets to ""...and they lived happily ever after"" theres generally nowhere to go. Adapted from William Steigs childrens book the 2001 computer-animated movie Shrek was a snarky irony-laden fairy tale but a fairy tale nonetheless and a sweet one at that. So Shrek 2 is hamstrung from the beginning as an unnecessary follow-up to a perfectly good happily ever after. For some an ending isnt actually happy until all the revenue streams have been tapped and Shrek 2 suffers from the creative exhaustion of a sequel that didnt have to happen. Resuming the action with an entertaining sequence that could easily have played over Shreks closing credits Shrek 2 finds brogue-talking ogre Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers) and his new wife Fiona (Cameron Diaz) on their honeymoon. Moments after returning home theyre reunited with their cartoon donkey pal (Eddie Murphy) and on their way to meet Diazs parents (John Cleese and Julie Andrews) who exiled their daughter years before. After an uneasy family reunion the meddling of fairy godmother Jennifer Saunders and arrival of Prince Charming Rupert Everett throws the ogres marriage into confusion. Apparently the love-conquers-all message of the first film didnt quite sink in. Even so theres no doubt how the movie will end and the heroes wacky/arbitrary adventures never provide enough of a distraction from that inevitability. All the clever touches of the first Shrek return but in diminished form. In full self-deprecating Spy Kids mode Antonio Banderas makes for an entertaining Puss In Boots and its fun when Tom Waits voice starts coming out of a saloon piano player. But by the time Joan Rivers shows up in animated form the joke of the modern world invading the fairy-tale past has worn pretty thin. Cleese and Andrews rule over a kingdom that looks a lot like a storybook variation on Hollywood and that gag like the first films Michael Eisner-baiting will probably play better to Hollywood Reporter subscribers than to doll-toting kids. (Or most of the rest of the world for that matter.) The expansive vistas and expressive character design remain a wonder but the story is never as impressive as the animation. Shrek 2 sustains Shreks sweet tone but it never joins that tone to real emotions. The lovable characters remain but they never do much of interest in a sequel thats safely above average but superfluous.

(c)2004 Dreamworks Pictures By Christy Lemire AP Entertainment Writer Whatever was wrong with ""Shrek"" -- and there were more weaknesses than its beloved status would suggest - has been eradicated or improved upon with ""Shrek 2 a rare example of a sequel thats better than the original. The computer-generated animation which dazzled the first time in 2001 looks even better. The backgrounds and landscapes are even more lush and de-tailed from the realistic drops of water during a thunderstorm to the contours left in the snow after a horse-drawn carriage has rumbled through. The cha-racters movements are smoother not as herky-jerky - especially those of Princess Fiona (voiced by Cameron Diaz) - all of which contributes to the sensation of watching something truly filmic not digitally manufactured. But the most important change of all and the most fundamental is in the screenplay. While the ""Shrek script consisted of little more than a litany of pop culture references many of which already felt stale ""Shrek 2 has a strong story line with more fully developed characters. The in-jokes that do exist here seem relevant including a clever little reference to Justin Timberlake Diazs real-life beau. A send-up of ""COPS -- called ""KNIGHTS in keeping with the fairy-tale theme -- is a fast-paced dead-on riot. Other pop culture references -- to movie musicals Beverly Hills cliches and old Hollywood - seem classic and more likely to withstand the test of time unlike those in the first ""Shrek which included tired takeoffs on ""The Matrix and the Macarena. These of course are intended to en-tertain the adults in the audience - and theyll succeed - but theres plenty to keep the kids happy too. ""Shrek 2 like the first is bright light and colorful with a nonstop energy thats infectious. Several strong supporting characters and actors have been added to the al-ready-solid lineup of returning vocal talent led by Diaz Mike Myers as the lovable ogre Shrek and Eddie Murphy as his perpetually perky sidekick Don-key. Picking up right where the original left off ""Shrek 2 begins with the new-ly married ogre couple returning from their honeymoon and receiving an in-vitation to visit Princess Fionas parents King Harold (John Cleese) and Queen Lillian (Julie Andrews) who rule over the kingdom of Far Far Away. Donkey tags along. Upon first meeting the boorish Shrek the in-laws dont exactly approve. While the queen eventually tries to be conciliatory the king and Shrek get into a passive-aggressive shouting match over dinner in which they tear apart all the food on the table (and each other al-most). Meanwhile Fionas fairy godmother (voiced decadently by Jennifer Saun-ders from ""Absolutely Fabulous) is astonished to learn that the princess has gotten married. Her son the self-obsessed blond-tressed Prince Charm-ing (Rupert Everett) was supposed to have rescued Fiona from the tower and lived happily ever after with her - but he got there too late. This brings us to the most fantastic addition of all to the ""Shrek series Puss-in-Boots a tabby cat decked out in tiny Zorro duds and voiced by An-tonio Banderas in a nod to his starring role in ""The Mask of Zorro in 1998. Puss-in-Boots is sent to take out Shrek which would make way for a fairy-tale ending for Fiona and Prince Charming. Instead the kitty ends up warming to the big green guy and fight-ing on his side even after Shrek has undergone a medieval version of ""Ex-treme Makeover thinking thats what Fiona really wants in a husband. The character alternates with catlike agility between sword-fighting bravado and saucer-eyed vulnerability and Banderas plays him with a sexual am-biguity that adds a hilariously subversive layer of humor to the film. You could easily imagine him slashing and purring his way to his own movie. The moral of the story - that love conquers all despite appearances - is the same as the first movie. Even that element is conveyed with a lighter touch this time something that seems unlikely in a film with three directors and about a half-dozen screenwriters. ""Shrek 2 a DreamWorks release was co-written and directed by An-drew Adamson and co-directed by Kelly Asbury and Conrad Vernon. Its rated PG for some crude humor a brief substance reference and some suggestive content. Running time 93 minutes. Return to top Copyright(c) 2000 - 2016 Canarsie Courier Publications Inc.

Comments Shrek 2 Free Rated PG  105 minutes At the end of the digitally animated Shrek the lovely Princess Fiona (given voice by Cameron Diaz) flipped the formula of Beauty and the Beast by electing to become a stocky green ogre just like her gruff but tender beau (Mike Myers); this time around she faces the delicate task of bringing him home to mom and dad (Julie Andrews and John Cleese). Like the first movie this is unassailable family entertainment with a gentle fairy tale for kids and a raft of mildly satirical pop-culture references for parents. Antonio Banderas is very funny as the Zorro-esque Puss in Boots and there are two priceless set pieces a parody of COPS and a giddy survey of the kingdom which is a medieval version of Rodeo Drive.

Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Entertainment News Forget rescuing princesses from fire-breathing dragons. Everyone who has ever tried it knows that marriage (official or un-) is the most dangerous adventure known to man- and womankind. Every year millions attempt it and millions of others flee from it in remorse and defeat. So while I suppose there are children out there who are excited about the prospect of ""Shrek 2"" my hunch is that by and large its really their parents who are brimming with curiosity about the fate of the cantankerously likable ogre Shrek and his new bride Princess Fiona now that the pair face the grim thankless task of attempting to live happily ever after. Is it going too far out on a beanstalk to say that ""Shrek 2 is one of the most mature movies about adult relationships ever made? At the very least I think its accurate to say that among movies aimed primarily at children ""Shrek 2 is redolent of a specifically adult wistfulness -- its a happy picture but one thats nonetheless aware of the sometimes uncomfortable stretching and contorting that two people have to endure when they attempt to build a life together. ""Shrek 2 may also be the first animated feature about among other things the unpredictability of sexual attraction. If the message of the first ""Shrek"" was the wearisomely threadbare ""Real beauty is on the inside"" the message of ""Shrek 2 is the significantly more complicated ""You probably dont realize it but the chubby pimply kid who picks his nose in homeroom may quite possibly grow up to be much better in the sack and a nicer guy than the Troy Donahue look-alike everybody swoons over."" ""Shrek 2 never suggests we should ignore good character in favor of animal attraction. But just as significantly it acknowledges that people (and ogres) arent just walking compendia of noble inner virtues. Looks do matter to us -- its only when we get hung up on the conventions of good looks that we get into trouble. Fat or thin conventionally pretty or not flesh-toned or green ""Shrek 2 believes in the erotic possibilities of everyone. ""Shrek 2 opens with the honeymoon of Shrek (voice provided by Mike Myers) and Fiona (Cameron Diaz) Theyve rented a gingerbread house by the sea and they roll around on the shore ""From Here to Eternity""-style enjoying each other in a way thats NC-17 in spirit if not in explicitness. (""Shrek 2 is incidentally rated a relatively chaste and child-friendly PG.) Shrek and Fiona share luxurious mud baths together giggling cheerfully if one of them should pass gas. (Like its predecessor ""Shrek 2 has its share of fart and poo jokes; my favorite touch is the magic-potion bottle marked with the incongruous legend ""Toadstool Softener."") But Shrek and Fionas fairy tale-honeymoon happiness cant last forever. After they return to their ogre hut ready to start their everyday life together they receive an invitation from Fionas mother and father the king and queen of Far Far Away (played by John Cleese and Julie Andrews). The king and queen have not met Fionas husband and they want to throw a wedding ball in honor of the couple. So Shrek and Fiona travel to the kingdom -- with Donkey (Eddie Murphy) making loud loud lip-smacking noises in the back seat of their carriage all the way -- only to discover that Fionas parents couldnt be more disapproving of Shrek. Their disapproval is blatant and hurtful As Shrek and Fiona approach the parental castle the king suggests to his wife they go inside turn off the lights and pretend theyre not at home. We learn that unbeknownst to his wife the king had made a deal with the local and very power-hungry fairy godmother (Jennifer Saunders of ""Absolutely Fabulous"") Her son the fussy preening Prince Charming (played with hilarious bubbleheaded insouciance by Rupert Everett) was supposed to be the one to rescue Fiona from the spell that made her an ogre in the first place -- the two of them would then be joined in marriage. Shreks appearance on the scene messed up the devious duos meticulously laid plan and they scheme to find a way to remove him from the picture. Meanwhile though unsettled by the chilly reception theyve gotten from the king and queen Fiona and Shrek bicker and spar. Fiona even though shes a grown-up and even though she knows shes chosen the right guy for her cant help wanting their approval. Shrek fears for the first time that he really doesnt measure up. Fiona frustrated and confused by her own feelings seizes upon his stubbornness and crankiness. The two hurl accusations at each other ""I made changes for you Shrek"" Fiona says bitterly at one point. ""Think about that."" This is a peculiarly stinging type of fairy-tale discord and while it may be geared toward adults I dont think its beyond children to understand its essential nature While ""Shrek 2 doesnt rub kids noses in their worst fears the way many of the classic Disney pictures do (""Bambi"" is Exhibit A) it doesnt talk down to them either. ""Shrek 2 was directed by Andrew Adamson (also one of the directors of ""Shrek"") Kelly Asbury and Conrad Vernon. Its script is by Adamson Joe Stillman J. David Stem and David N. Weiss and I only wish that there were more live-action pictures written with as much careful shaping. Shrek leaves the castle on an adventure that he hopes will help Fiona realize she made the right choice -- he thinks she has doubts about having married him not recognizing that her love for him is the one thing shes certain of. But ""Shrek 2 doesnt feel heavy-handed or lesson-logged If anything it has a lighter touch than its predecessor even though its themes are more complicated. You Might Also Like The picture is clever and vivacious -- at times like the first ""Shrek"" it seems a bit taken with its own precociousness. But its moments of sheer inventiveness can still catch you off-guard and some of them are wittily poetic. The streets of Far Far Away are lined with Beverly Hills-style mansions (the names of Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty are wrought right into their curly iron gates) and swanky stores like the bow-and-arrow supply joint Versarchery (its sign even uses the Versace typeface). As Fiona gazes out a window unhappily we see the kingdoms named spelled out on the hills behind her just like the Hollywood sign. ""Happiness is just a teardrop away"" reads the business card that the meddlesome fairy godmother gives to Fiona after trying to force her into an extreme makeover she doesnt want in the least. ""Shrek 2 doesnt set itself up as a sanctimonious indictment of Hollywood shallowness but it shows a limited amount of patience with Hollywoods preoccupation with looks style and status. Theyre hollow things to be pricked like balloons but the movie doesnt make the mistake of building dopey homilies around them. Like the first ""Shrek"" ""Shrek 2 mixes and matches a panoply of fairy-tale characters Pinocchio appears in a daring rescue mission -- hes lowered by his strings into a dark hole to the strains of the ""Mission Impossible"" theme. There are three blind mice who do little more than run around and bump into things but theyre still hilarious in an admittedly Three Stooges kind of way. The best character of all is the orange tabby Puss in Boots (played with impeccable timing by Antonio Banderas) who sashays and saunters through the picture as if he owns it -- but who also looks suitably embarrassed when at an inconvenient moment he hacks up a large fur ball. Theres only one thing wrong with ""Shrek 2"" and its a pretty major thing Its hyperrealistic animation threatens to hold us apart from the intensity of the story instead of drawing us into it. I had the same problem with the first ""Shrek"" While I can tolerate the animal characters the animated human figures with their airbrushy skin tones and glassy-looking eyes give me the willies. The look-at-me technique of ""Shrek 2 detracts from instead of enhancing the buoyancy of the direction and the writing. Still I gave in to ""Shrek 2 perhaps partly because this time around I at least knew what to expect. Computer animation still leaves me cold but the sensibility behind ""Shrek 2 doesnt. For a ""childrens"" picture ""Shrek 2 delves into some pretty complicated ideas about parental relationships While many kids movies pit the cluelessness of parents against the simple wisdom of children ""Shrek 2 is the first kids movie I can think of that recognizes that even after were grown up our parents dont always behave as wed like them to (or as they should). Their age or ours has nothing to do with what we like to call maturity. And then theres the scene that defines the nature of the bond between Shrek and Fiona. Its not giving too much away to tell you that Fiona has a chance to become as ""attractive"" as Prince Charming is ""handsome"" and to trade her beloved green fatso for this tall thin movie-star-like fellow. But when Prince Charming tries to kiss her she literally recoils from him. Its her Shrek shes longing for the guy who woke up on the other side of her bed not so long ago scratching his bulbous stomach and shuffling along in his undershorts and socks. Theres no explaining why we fall for or stick with the people we do. ""Shrek 2 isnt one of those thinly veiled conservative sermons the kind of thing that stresses how grown-ups should stick together for the sake of the children or for God or for the good of society at large. Its about grown-ups sticking together for the sake of themselves. Its a movie about both the selflessness and the selfishness of love. Its about how we want whom we want -- even if hes fat and green.

Which makes perfect sense given the nearly nonstop barrage of inside-jokey references to ""From Here to Eternity"" ""Alien"" ""Mission Impossible"" ""The Lord of the Rings"" ""Spider-Man"" ""King Kong"" ""Its a Wonderful Life"" ""The Mask of Zorro"" ""Cinderella"" ""Beauty and the Beast"" the TV show ""Cops"" the Oscar telecast and about a thousand other references to La-La Land I didnt have time to write down. Why would I want to spend the whole movie with my nose buried in a note pad? I might have missed a laugh. As with ""The Simpsons"" another gold mine of knowingly self-referential humor prized for its high-volume use of evanescent sight gags that whiz by in the background ""Shrek 2"" seems made for repeat viewings on video or DVD. The gags fly past so fast and furious here that its impossible to catch them all without a pause button. Picking up where ""Shrek"" left off our story begins with the honeymoon of ogre Shrek (voice of Mike Myers) and Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) she having been only recently rescued from a dragon-guarded castle by the Green-Skinned One. It isnt long after eloping however that the newlyweds are invited by her parents the King and Queen of Far Far Away (John Cleese and Julie Andrews) for a visit. Now this may seem strange given that it was Mummy and Daddy who locked Fiona away in a castle to begin with. This was their somewhat medieval solution to the curse that had turned her into a hag each night after sunset. Despite this theyre not pardon the expression ogres. Nevertheless Fionas folks are more than a bit disappointed in their daughters choice of husband having hoped that the vain Brad Pitt-like Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) might have been the one to sweep their little girl off her feet and break the spell. Turns out though Charming was a little late getting to Fiona who is now stuck 24-7 with skin as green as Shreks. Tensions needless to say run high during these awkward ""Meet the Parents"" moments. So high in fact that the King hires a killer named Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) to off his son-in-law even as Shrek runs away seeking assistance from Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) in a mission to find a spell that will make himself more lovable. Hilarious complications as they say ensue thanks in no small part to the supporting cast. Chief among them is Banderas mocking some of his own derring-do roles (not to mention his Latin-lover shtick) with gleeful scene-stealing abandon. Saunders of ""Absolutely Fabulous"" fame brings a deliciously nasty edge to her role as the meddling mother (yes Prince Charming is her son). Holding a dark secret over the Kings head as blackmail shes about as far from the benign Disney-fied wand-waver as possible. Reprising his role as Shreks talkative asinine animal sidekick Donkey Eddie Murphy is good for a few more laughs too. Still the one-note burros no match for Banderass tomcat who gets as much comic mileage from his propensity for making sad-eyed cat faces -- just before pouncing -- as he does from his ability to lick his own crotch. But it is Myers and Diaz who breathe the most life into their computer-animated characters -- and the film. As they did in the first movie they make Shrek and Fiona so much more than cartoons. Sure the animation work is great but its the actors and their subtle complex vocal performances that make us care about these fairy-tale characters. ""Shrek 2"" is all about fantasy but its characters are rousingly affectingly real -- not to mention real real funny. SHREK 2 (PG 93 minutes) -- Contains some edgy humor mild jokes about body fluids and gasses vaguely sexual references along the lines of ""a roll in the hay"" and slapstick violence. Area theaters.

Thats especially so for Princess Fiona since Mom and Dad are King and Queen of Far Far Away and her beloved is green overweight and notably lacking in the social graces. Also of course his best pal is an emotionally needy motor-mouthed Donkey. In Shrek 2 the altogether adorable sequel to the animated sensation of three years ago the nice young couple is obliged to overcome many obstacles before gaining her familys acceptance of an ogre as son-in-law and a genial ending. Mostly the trouble stems from a Fairy Godmother who thinks her handsome egomaniac son would be a much better mate for Fiona but who goes to Shrek movies for the plot? God may or may not be in the details but the best laughs surely are. For example this films most delightful new character is Puss In Boots (brilliantly voiced by Antonio Banderas). Hired by the King to slay Shrek but soon his ally Puss vies with Donkey for the coveted role of ""annoying talking animal."" Striking a heroic pose swishing his sword with menacing elan he is suddenly undone by that most undignified of feline problems -- a hair ball. So it goes in this movie Pinocchio has a cross-dressing secret; Joan Rivers does inane fashion commentary on the red carpet leading to a palace shindig; a dash to rescue the Princess is interrupted by corrupt cops who plant an illegal drug -- Yikes Its catnip -- on Puss while tabloid TV covers the bust. The most basic Shrek joke -- satirized modernity intruding on fairy-tale romance -- is played in 100 variants some of which will sail over the heads of the littlest kids in the audience (theres plenty else to keep them giggling) but will be very gratefully received by those on parental-guidance duty. This wonderfully animated movie is a little more softly pitched than its predecessor but it still has plenty of rollicking spin on the ball.

"The pleasures of Shrek 2. Slate Sign In Sign Up The pleasures of Shrek 2. The pleasures of Shrek 2. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 19 2004 656 PM Green Like Me The pleasures of Shrek 2. By David Edelstein Green rested and better than ever As maybe the only person on the planet indifferent to Shrek (2001) I felt like a fat green ogre in a sea of frolicking pixies; and rather than write about how puke-ugly I thought the movie looked and how bored I was with the smirky in-jokes and the fast-talking black-guy sidekick disguised as a donkey I folded up my word processor and slunk into my cave. Shrek had its felicities--none more prophetic than the mendacious Lord Farquaads exhortation to his troops ""Some of you may die but its a sacrifice Im willing to make."" I wasnt prepared though for the slap-happy brilliance of Shrek 2 (DreamWorks) which should ideally be seen twice--once with kids once savored at something like a midnight show. The improvements in Shrek 2--directed by Andrew Adamson Kelly Asbury and Conrad Vernon--begin with the plot which isnt another cookie-cutter odyssey but a plunge into the happily-ever-after-land of the ogre Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers) and his bride Fiona (Cameron Diaz). As often happens on honeymoons the lovebirds revel in their shared freakiness unmoved by the pitchfork-wielding mob that flatulent ogres having noisy (PG) sex in their fields tend to attract. Advertisement Problems arrive with an invitation from Fionas mom and dad the king (John Cleese) and queen (Julie Andrews) who dont realize that their beauteous daughter has not only married a mammoth trumpet-eared slab of green beef but has gaily become one herself. Understandably put out is a certain Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) with his heart (or rather ego) set on the princess; and even more incensed is his mom (Jennifer Saunders) a professional fairy godmother who behind her twinkly facade hatches a plan to turn Fiona back into a willowy redhead and pair her up with her preening boy. The question in Shrek 2 is not just how one rescues a princess but how one makes that relationship work within a family--and a society--that has major race/species issues. You could say the film boils down to a laudably progressive plea on behalf of so-called misfits to let them stay true to their essential misfit selves. Fortunately theres no need to boil it down--just wallow in the wave upon wave of parodies songs and stupendous visual and vocal characterizations. I should add that I still dont love the 3-D look which at times is startlingly lifelike--a small step removed from virtual reality. My taste runs to cartoons that are thoroughly cartoonlike madly improvising with the laws of time and space in the manner of last years surreal synapse-tickling The Triplets of Belleville. More annoying are the fast-food tie-ins with chain outlets cleverly transformed into medieval equivalents Its all just parodic enough to make you forget that theres nothing cute about telling kids even for yuks that Burger King Starbucks and other mega-corporations have always been part of the landscape. It would be nice if the Shrek 2 had more original songs I enjoyed Pete Yorns new cover of the Buzzcocks ""Ever Fallen in Love With Someone"" but my heart sank when Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss-in-Boots (Antonio Banderas) launched into a rollicking duet that turned out to be ... ""Livin la Vida Loca."" After a measured first hour the final third gives way to a dizzying procession of take-offs one more ingenious than the next I only hope the person who came up with the Pinocchio meets Mission Impossible gag got one-tenth as much pleasure out of it as I did. (The writers are J. David Stem Joe Stillman and David N. Weiss.) It would be tasteless to give away any jokes--well Ill give away one when Donkey warns Puss ""The position of annoying talking animal has already been taken."" That suggests a healthy attitude toward Murphys braying ass who actually does manage to make room for Banderas joyously subtle feline--a show-stopping reworking of his Zorro with an even more disarming weapon a pair of impossibly adorable schlock-kitty-painting saucer eyes. Its possible that the Fairy Godmother (created by Saunders from Absolutely Fabulous and the animators) is an even more remarkable creation like the sugary/steely face of the modern Disney. Thats the true target of Shrek 2 the entertainment conglomerate with its rigid enforcement of happily-ever-afterdom. Generously bankrolled by a big Hollywood studio which stands to make billions from box-office and merchandising and product tie-ins Shrek 2 nevertheless suggests how to keep your head when those around you are surgically altering theirs.

As it turns out Shrek 2 is one of the funniest movies Ive seen in years. But Im far from sure that its a kids movie anymore even though like its predecessor its a thoroughly sugared-up reading of the book by veteran New Yorker cartoonist William Steig on which both films are based. Like many gifted childrens writers -- among them Hans Christian Andersen and Roald Dahl -- Steig who died last October didnt much like children in real life and he had a poor opinion of families in general. But he understood kids innate suspicion of sweetness and light and their gleeful fascination with the macabre and he never tried to clean up the world for them. Steigs ogre isnt just homely -- what makes him funny is that hes hideous and that he hates most of humanity children included. Theres no sweet fellow waiting to bust through Shreks crusty exterior. Hes a dyed-in-the-wool misanthrope and remains one to the end while the woman of his dreams is as magnificently ugly inside and out as he is. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Tweaked and claymated for maximal adorability the Shrek according to DreamWorks was as cuddly as could be. After a little perfunctory growling at some dispossessed fairy-tale characters it was no time at all before he allowed Princess Fiona and the worlds most garrulous donkey (Eddie Murphy) to warm his none-too-frozen heart. True Shrek had the courage of its pro-fat convictions. Delivered from her narcissistic fantasies about the handsome prince who would rescue her from her castle Fiona retained her chubbier if hardly unsightly ogre self to marry her swain and sail away in their garlic carriage to live happily ever after in his beloved swamp. But Shrek was more an inversion than a subversion of the standard Prince Charming story and a good-natured unthreatening one to boot. With Shrek 2 -- riddled with pop in-jokes and an amiable if iconoclastic skewering of classic fairy tales -- the franchise doesnt so much top itself as sail into overdrive and from an adults point of view at least its none the worse for it. From the moment were reunited with Shrek and the missus the movie is throwing out film references like theres no tomorrow. We meet Shrek and Fiona contentedly porked out and frolicking happily in their swamp. After a roll in the waves recalling Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerrs sultry clinch in From Here to Eternity they discover theres trouble in paradise and its name is in-laws. Having gotten wind of Fionas rescue her parents invite the happy couple to a wedding celebration in the Kingdom of Far Far Away a divine cross between Beverly Hills and Universal CityWalk complete with Farbucks Coffee and a doctored Hollywood sign nestled in the hills. Over their first evening meal en famille -- either Guess Whos Coming to Dinner or Meet the Parents depending on when you grew up -- King Harold (voiced by a querulous John Cleese) and Queen Lillian (Julie Andrews reprising her regal dignity in The Princess Diaries) try to overcome their shock at their daughters altered appearance and her new husbands table manners. Good soul that she is the Queen only wants her daughter to be happy but the King conspires for mysterious reasons of his own to pry Fiona loose from her swamp thing and replace him with Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) a blond creep of staggering vanity whose cerebral assets are set close to zero. Working closely with the princes fairy-godmother mum (Ab Fabs hilariously tart Jennifer Saunders) a blue-rinsed gorgon with all the charm of a ranking Hollywood agent the King hires an expert to whack Shrek. Puss-in-Boots the famed ogre killer and Shrek 2s showpiece as well as a canny bow to the burgeoning Latino audience is a pintsize ginger fellow voiced by Antonio Banderas (wildly spoofing his role in Zorro) who can shrink into a giant pair of cute Walter Keane eyes or rise to the swashbuckling occasion as needed. Unluckily for the royal family Puss takes one look at the Shreks and seeing soul mates throws in his lot with them to the loudly brayed disgust of Donkey who sees only a sibling rival.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm The rest of Shrek 2 is an exuberant bounce through more action-movie send-ups (from King Kong to The Matrix) and irreverent sight gags than you could possibly catch in a single sitting culminating in a final good-humored poke at the Oscars hosted by a Joan Rivers whose grinning mug looks only marginally more claymated than her worked-over face in real life. (Shreks own transformation into a credible human hunk is stupendous.) Though full of excitable gay wit (Larry King voices a musclebound drag-queen Ugly Stepsister who tends bar at the Poison Apple) and British cheek (it takes real brass to bestow a broad Glasgow accent on the hero of a movie designed to take the global box office by storm) Shrek 2 is rarely mean or cynical. The Shreks are as warmly interpreted as ever by Cameron Diaz and by Mike Myers in a performance that shows up everything that was wrong with his misbegotten feline in The Cat in the Hat. And the fairy-tale characters however gently mocked are after all the ones who rally to rescue Shrek and company from a sorry climactic mess.   In a world where little girls are modeling themselves after Britney Spears who would quarrel with a story that throws its weight behind the plump and homely? Still -- and it feels almost churlish to say this about a movie that gives such a rollicking good time -- Shrek 2 ups the hip-allusive quotient to such a pitch one has to wonder whats in it for the little kids to whom the movie has already been pre-sold in the usual hurricane of television ads toy-store tie-ins and schoolyard word of mouth. There isnt a child in my daughters kindergarten class who isnt chafing for a date with Shrek 2. Yet it was mainly adults I heard shrieking with laughter in the movie theater. The two little girls accompanying me -- bewildered by most everything but the uplifting message and a frankly pandering coda -- glommed onto a favorite character and clung to it with desperate tenacity. To the degree that Shrek 2 attends to little kids at all it traffics in cuteness The script canny as it may be has about as much to do with Steigs understanding of the dark side of childrens imaginative lives as a Hallmark card. Given the pointlessly violent crap todays kids soak up on a daily basis I suppose we should be thankful for small mercies. But Id almost rather go with Steigs gleeful malevolence than encourage kids to get hip to the postmodern before their time. In asking small children to go along with the ridicule however affectionate of their favorite fairy-tale characters we may be crafting a depressingly premature generation of ironic kindergartners.

Directors Andrew Adamson Kelly Asbury and Conrad Vernon (145). PG Crude humor brief substance reference and some suggestive content. 3.5 STARS. Shrek 2"" delivers more fun than there is slime in a green ogres swamp. Much of that is thanks to Antonio Banderas who runs away with ""Shrek 2"" on little cat feet. Banderas provides the voice of the inspired new character Puss in Boots - a feline of enormous charisma and dignity except when he happens to be chucking up a hairball or uh grooming himself. With a dash of Zorro a wink at Banderas other screen characters and a liquid-eyed adorability Puss deserves his own spinoff series - not to mention a warm bowl of milk. Ol reliable sidekick Donkey (Eddie Murphy) is right to feel threatened when Shrek (Mike Myers) begins spending more time with the kitten in thigh-high leather boots. This sequel to the enormously successful ""Shrek"" takes up where fairy tales usually fade out after the misanthropic ogre of the title sweeps his one true ogress off her bunioned feet. The story begins on their honeymoon where Shrek and Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) make out in a ""From Here to Eternity"" surf. Bliss doesnt last long again putting to rout the notion that ""happily ever after"" is the last word on any tale. Fiona drags Shrek to meet the parents - with the voices of Julie Andrews and John Cleese - in the Kingdom of Far Far Away. Far Far Away is structured to provide a few digs at the not-so-wonderful world of Disney from this DreamWorks production. As Shrek expected he gets a cold reception. Its not the first time a son-in-law has been rejected as a mouth-breathing swamp-dwelling intruder. The disapproving in-laws angle doesnt make for original storytelling - even with the prettifying potions and plot complications caused by a scheming fairy godmother (Jennifer Saunders of ""Ab Fab"") and her narcissistic son Prince Charming (Rupert Everett). The delirious second half goes back to the comic roots of the first ""Shrek"" mining the idea that fairy-tale figures stay in character and suffer consequences long after the fadeouts of their familiar narratives. Jokes and movie references begin to fly like mud splattering off Demi Moores potters wheel. Joan Rivers sends up her Oscar-night play-by-play. Larry King provides the ragged voice of an Ugly Stepsister barmaid. Theres an ingenious Frankensteins monster that far outclasses anything in ""Van Helsing."" The jokes target all age groups so that ""Shrek 2"" can open its doors wide to audiences this summer. Considering the hit-and-miss nature of this kind of movie it does quite well. Things keep getting better right through an inspired Hollywood musical ending full of exuberance and creative charm.

In Shrek 2 the jolly green monster returns from his honeymoon with Fiona his green heavyset lady love to find his old pal Donkey has moved into his house and Fionas parents -- the king and queen of a place called Far Far Away -- would like the newlyweds to visit. Shrek doesnt want to do it. He knows mom and pop will hate him but Fiona prevails and soon the three of them are on their way. Further complicating things is that the parents mistakenly think shes married the handsome Prince Charming whose kiss was to have turned her into a ravishing beauty. Everyone in the kingdom (which looks amazingly like Beverly Hills) turns out for their arrival (which looks amazingly like the red carpet scene at the Oscars). And the entire kingdom is speechless when Shrek and Fiona step out of their coach. Mike Myers Cameron Diaz and the irrepressible Eddie Murphy supply the lead voices same as in the first film but since the first Shrek came out weve seen that other skinny blonde Gwyneth Paltrow in a fat suit in Shallow Hal. Thats who Fiona kept reminding me of. Shrek which won the first-ever Oscar for best animated feature was terrific. Few sequels feel as fresh as the original and this is no exception although a hilarious new character keeps things lively. Antonio Banderas provides the voice for a sword-wielding would-be assassin named Puss In Boots who threatens to nudge the annoying Donkey to the status of sidekick No. 2 (and not a minute too soon). The digital artwork and computer-generated characters remain impressive especially in action scenes and panoramas. The animation is least persuasive when the characters stand around talking. Their gestures look mechanical and rote like those of teenage thespians in a school production. Luckily the action- and music-filled story doesnt leave a lot of room for conversation. The movie is studded with generic-sounding rock covers but you cant fault a movie music supervisor who manages to slip Tom Waits and Nick Cave onto the soundtrack (though you can fault somebody for having their voices come out of the mouth of the same character a nameless barroom piano player). The cast also includes John Cleese and Julie Andrews doing the voices of Fionas parents and Rupert Everett as Prince Charming. Jennifer Saunders star of the popular British TV series Absolutely Fabulous does Fionas Fairy Godmother. A silly overblown rescue scene near the end provides evidence of exhausted imagination on the part of the screenwriters and the musical number that ends the film doesnt compare to the kicky close of the original Shrek but what could? Its entertaining enough. The same can be said of the movie as a whole.

David Stemand David N. Weiss Starring Mike Myers Cameron Diaz Eddie Murphy Antonio Banderas Jennifer Saunders Classification G Rating 1/2 Its lightning quick its ultra-slick its awfully funny and needless to say its state of the art digitally animated right down to the last perfect hair on that donkeys smart ass. Even better in a computerized culture that has cartoons looking realistic and live-action seeming cartoonish and in a topsy-turvy world that has children looking grown-up and grownups seeming childish this sequel is shrewdly pitched to the shared middle of the spectrum - that amiable place where parents can hold hands with their kids marvel in unison at the digitalized sights and who knows maybe even explain the jokes to each other. Yep Shrek 2 deserves nothing more than its own user-friendly rating Two tooty-ears up way more than halfway up. The script jumps in where all fairy tales (and Shrek 1) leave off - after the happily ever after as our kindly ogre and his freshly minted missus get spirited away on a whirlwind honeymoon. Cue the montage of merriment in the mud where the amorous sights are almost as reassuring as the old sounds a besotted Shrek with his Scottish brogue (more Mike Myers) a fulfilled Fiona with her Everygirl chirp (Cameron Diaz again). Gosh in passions swamp theirs is a monstrous love to make us green with envy. Meanwhile back in the real world where beauty is reassuringly more than skin deep the King and Queen (John Cleese and Julie Andrews) have issued a royal invite to the newlyweds summoning them to the pleasures of the court. So with their faithful comic relief in tow (cant have a sequel sans Eddie Murphys motor-mouth donkey) the trio make the journey to the kingdom of Far Far Away which bears a certain resemblance to a land that is Near Near and Dear - on a posh Romeo Drive the medieval glitterati shuttle from Versarchery to Abercrombie amp; Witch stopping for a skinny latte at Farbucks and a sinful snack at Baskin Robbinhood (XXXI Flavours). You get the picture. The puns come thick and fast while the pop culture riffing never stops as yesterdays fables get decked out in todays quips. Bring on the Guess Whos Coming to Dinner parody Daddy takes a dim view of his daughters mixed marriage; he prefers his princes charming and vain and sporting the haughty accent of Rupert Everett at his most plummy. So does the Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders at her Ab Fab best) who weaves a mean wand in this outing. Summoned by Fionas tears her entrance is a gorgeous piece of animation with a wicked kicker - she emerges out of one bubble only to burst another. From there yesterday and today continue their lively jitterbug. The fable introduces a potion that turns a jive-talking ass into a preening white charger and a one-woman ogre into a babe-magnet hunk. Of course in fairy tales metamorphosis is always a great teacher and the lesson here is more of the same - you know pretty is fine but home(ly) and hearth are better. Thats the moral yet its just an old-fashioned face to accommodate all the contemporary winking at everything from Mission Impossible and Justin Timberlake to reality cop shows and Livin La Vida Loca. Sometimes old and new morph together as when the Gingerbread Man balloons into a brown Michelin Man or when a down-at-the-heels Captain Hook pops up in a dingy piano bar croaking out a Tom Waits tune - namely Little Drop of Poison. Dont know how many eight-year-olds will catch that reference but its a funny earful for the rest of us. Most of the humour is like that the split-level kind that has one tier for the adults and another for the kiddies with a common room to house the sight gags. But everyone in the place regardless of age will agree on the tiny star who steals the show. Its the diminutive Puss in Boots a swashbuckling fur-ball with a pirate hat and a baleful gaze and a heap of hilarious attitude thanks to the vocal pyrotechnics of Antonio Banderas (no doubt warming up for his own sequel in Zorro 2). Even Murphys donkey is daunted and snarls in a jealous snit ""Im sorry - the position of Annoying Talking Animal has already been taken."" Spoiler alert Making for very strange bedfellows indeed Puss n Donk end up proving just how loca la vida is. In short the Shrek franchise is alive and well - Model 2 is zippier sleeker with ever-improving graphics vast commercial potential and the same sly ability to reach out and hook the whole family. So brace yourself. Children love repetition (almost as much as Hollywood) and a year from now when youve bought little Johnny the DVD and watched him watch it 400 times be prepared to feel married to the ogre yourself - more or less happily and surely ever after.

"The Ugly Truth About Shrek 2 - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Fiona The Ugly Truth About Shrek 2MOVIE REVIEW - `Shrek 2Filmdoms Favorite Ogre Couple Are Back - Cursed By A Sequel Filled With Tired Gags Adult Zingers And A Story Stuck In Neutral.May 19 2004|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie CriticAny semblance Shrek 2 has to a childrens movie is whisked away when Puss-in-Boots is busted on Cops.Actually the TV show spoof is called Knights. But theres Puss paws against the wall with a law enforcement officer dangling a dime bag of . . . catnip.""Hones officer ees not mine"" the cavalier cat purrs in the voice of Antonio Banderas.A novel moment in the history of animated fairy tales and a funny one. And an adult one. There are a lot of them in this sequel to the irreverent jokey pop culture-savvy cartoon smash of 2001. So long as you think flatulence pants that ride down on the overweight Viagra jokes or Eddie Murphy singing ""One is the Loneliest Number"" is funny to grown-ups.Gags that feel tired too many musical interludes a story that doesnt really progress from the first film -- Shrek 2 feels a day late and an enchanted princess short.Shrek and Fiona the ogre and homely princess voiced by Mike Myers and Cameron Diaz are married. Maybe its time to meet the folks -- her folks a king (John Cleese) and queen (Julie Andrews) who dont appreciate their ogre of a son-in-law. Shrek in saving Fiona from the dragon bungled her chances of being kissed by a handsome prince and transformed into somebody who would fit in at Sleeping Beautys slumber party.Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) was the guy who missed making that magic kiss. The king the prince and his fairy godmother mom (Jennifer Saunders) scheme to undo the love that Shrek and Fiona have found transform Fiona and to set Charming up to rule the kingdom of Far Far Away which looks suspiciously like Hollywood.The zingers about a glamorous neo-medieval Rodeo Drive in this land of ""swimming pools movie stars"" seemed played when they turned up in Ella Enchanted last month. Theyre no funnier here. Cleese in person is much sillier looking and more animated than he is here. Though the film starts with an eye-popping sequence that demonstrates how much more realistic computer animation can be the film suffers from the same immobile faces of clay that Shrek did.The best thing in 2 is Puss-in-Boots. Banderas with a playful accent and swashbuckling take on the role wins a grand entrance -- and the visual punch lines of his scenes work. Thats good because Myers and Murphy amusing enough the first time around have nothing else to say or do with their characters.The movie recycles more jabs at all things Disney. New jokes such as getting Joan Rivers to voice a medieval ""E"" red carpet show a chase involving a ""white bronco"" Captain Hook at the piano (singing with Tom Waits voice in one song) of the Poison Apple Pub lack the sparkle of life.As indeed does the film.The original Shrek for all its Oscar-winning box-office- dominating glory isnt holding up the way its Oscar competition of that year is. Monsters Inc. is winning the pre-K war -- which one would your 4-year-old rather sit through 34 times in a row?This time its the ogre not the emperor who has no clothes.

Too bad that some of Shreks green luster is wearing off. 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Shrek 2 Animation. With the voices of Mike Myers Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz. Directed by Andrew Adamson Kelly Asbury and Conrad Vernon. (PG. 96 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) So much has happened in the world since May 2001 when ""Shrek"" premiered in theaters that its easy to forget the delight that that movie was the technological advance it represented and the new tone it brought to animated films. A sequel was called for and so a sequel has arrived -- but its a slightly zombie-like version with the size look and shape of the original movie but without its lightness or spirit its soul. On the plus side the animation is still startlingly good and that as well as the occasional bursts of wit keeps ""Shrek 2"" afloat. Though the creative confidence seems to be lacking and the movies focus is off theres still something undeniably appealing about the whole ""Shrek"" atmosphere. The films storybook look and matter-of-fact characters are nice to be around even if the story repeatedly strikes a sour note. This time Shrek (Mike Myers) the big green ogre who lives in the woods and talks with a Scottish accent is a married man. His wife is Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) who as a result of the lifting of a spell has been transformed from a willowy beauty into a homely ogre with protruding ogrelike ears. Ogre and Mrs. are doing just fine living happily ever after until one day when they get an invitation to the palace to meet Fionas parents the king and queen (the voices of John Cleese and Julie Andrews). Part of the kick of ""Shrek"" was the way it took commonplace emotions and situations and brought them into a magical storybook context. Here an attempt is made to repeat that formula with Shrek having to deal with the pedestrian problem of in-law trouble. But the writers take the strategy too far grounding ""Shrek 2"" in too much reality. Thus when the king is horrified to see the princess going through life permanently in her homely incarnation or when he wonders out loud about how his daughter could possibly marry an ogre theres a tendency to see his point of view however unwillingly. This creates an ambivalence in the audience thats unpleasant. Even more unpleasant are the machinations of the king and the evil fairy godmother (the voice of Jennifer Saunders) to have Shrek assassinated. Of course fairy tales have always been full of violence and attempts at violence. But fairy tales usually create some distance the sense of a strange other world. By contrast in ""Shrek 2"" were repeatedly invited to see the characters world as a version of our world. The Kingdom of Far Far Away for example is presented as a medieval-inflected Hollywood with tour buses vendors selling ""star maps "" and a mountainside sign reading ""Far Far Away."" There are too many scenes in which Shrek the Donkey (the voice of Eddie Murphy) and Fiona dont appear at all because its the fairy godmother and the king who are really moving the plot. The filmmakers invest too much time and faith in the idea of the fairy godmother as being wickedly amusing but shes no Cruella De Vil and the movie suffers. It begins to recover only when the focus shifts back to Shrek about halfway through. The imaginative visuals go a long way toward making up for the storys lapses. At times the images have an almost photographic quality and its hard to believe the characters are animated at all. Shrek goes through much of the filmed transformed into a handsome man and its a testament to the taste and good sense of the art direction that a look is found for the handsome Shrek that in no way feels like a compromise of his ogre spirit. The best new addition is that of Puss n Boots an orange pint-sized swordsman voiced by Antonio Banderas. A great running joke involves the way that Puss uses his cuteness to his advantage looking big-eyed and pathetic before sinking his fangs into an opponents leg. The Puss scenes like the Shrek scenes can be enjoyed in between the missteps such as when the fairy godmother sings the Bonnie Tyler song ""I Need a Hero"" for no reason except filler. Theres intermittent fun to be had as soon as one surrenders hope that the new ""Shrek"" will be nearly as good as the original.

YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Mike Myers Eddie Murphy Cameron Diaz or Create your own Manage alerts | What is this? (CNN) -- ""Shrek 2"" is a Hollywood rarity a sequel every bit as good -- if not better -- than the original. The whole gang is back and then some. Mike Myers returns as the voice of the lovable ogre Shrek; Cameron Diaz is once again Princess Fiona now happily married to the ogre of her life; and Eddie Murphy is still spouting one-liners providing marvelous comic relief as Donkey.Fiona and her main man are settling down into domestic bliss when her parents the King (John Cleese) and Queen (Julie Andrews) of the Kingdom of Far Far Away command them to attend a royal ball. Now theyre the ones who sent Fiona into exile in the first place due to her annoying habit of turning into an ogre when the sun sets. The parents plan was for Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) to rescue her thereby breaking the curse and making her beautiful 24/7. It didnt work because Shrek rescued her first but the King and Queen havent learned that yet -- nor do they know that the couple is married. (As always the parents are the last to know.)So when Fiona shows up with Shrek (and Donkey in tow) the parents are royally -- well lets just say theyre less than thrilled.Welcoming a clever cat and a fairy godmotherIn addition to the royal couple and Prince Charming -- whose charm is questionable -- there are some other wonderful characters added to the mix. Antonio Banderas is hilarious as Puss-In-Boots a feline assassin who is sent to kill Shrek but instead becomes his staunch ally. Donkey however is not happy with his new sidekick competition. At one point he turns to Puss with the withering comment ""Im sorry but the position of annoying talking animal has already been taken.""Jennifer Saunders of ""Absolutely Fabulous"" fame plays the Fairy Godmother who is secretly the mother of Prince Charming. Notice there is no ""good"" proceeding ""Fairy"" in her name. This fairy godmother is rotten to the core and determined to replace Shrek with her toothy smiling son no matter what the cost.Cultural Cuisinart The Queen and King (Julie Andrews and John Cleese) are none too pleased with their daughters choice of a mate.So many sequels come off like a side dish nobody ordered. But ""Shrek 2"" feels just as fresh as the original. The storyline picks up seamlessly from the first film and doesnt feel forced at all. The film was directed by Andrew Adamson who was also behind the first film and the story is chock full of laughter for all ages. There are puns a-plenty for the kids and of course tons of wonderful zingers of the sort that adults loved so much in ""Shrek.""The Kingdom of Far Far Away is a dead ringer for Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills and there are dozens of other cultural touchstones such as the theme song to the old TV show ""Rawhide"" with new lyrics and parodies of such movies as ""The Matrix"" and ""Spider-Man."" Also look for a bit with a picture taped to the ceiling above Fionas girlhood bed. The stud in the photo ""Sir Justin"" looks a lot like a certain Justin dating a certain actress who happens to provide Fionas voice in this film.""Shrek"" was the first animated film to win an Academy Award in the category of best animated feature. Now with ""Shrek 2"" the filmmakers may pull off another Oscar win in the same category.All in all ""Shrek 2"" is downright wonderful. Its the best comedy of the year so far.""Shrek 2"" a DreamWorks release is rated PG.

"Happily ever ogre - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Happily ever ogre It gets off to a shaky start but in the end Shrek 2 proves the second times a charm By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  May 19 2004 Having no inherent reason to exist second films must struggle to convince us otherwise. That said I dont think Ive ever seen a movie plunge so far over the cliff before pulling out of its nosedive and soaring into the air (motor spluttering) as ""Shrek 2.""The new computer-animated green machine turns out to be a frenetic and very enjoyable 93 minutes at the movies for child and parent alike but you watch the first half through your fingers. It has taken four writers and three directors -- not all the kings horses and all the kings men but still -- to craft scenes of the lovable title ogre (voiced by Mike Myers) and his jolly green bride Fiona (Cameron Diaz) arguing tearfully about whether to visit her parents. Later they argue tearfully about the hard compromises necessary to maintaining a marriage. Maybe Im missing something here but does DreamWorks really think we want to pay for something we can get at home for free?Luckily weve had hints by then of the fizzy shallow pun-strewn lunacy that eventually lifts ""Shrek 2"" to within sight of the original film. In the honeymoon montage that begins the film there are references to ""From Here To Eternity"" ""The Lord of The Rings"" and ""The Little Mermaid"" -- more importantly at least two of those three gags get a laugh.But the story line remains the weakest and most forced part of ""Shrek 2"" and sometimes you pray for it to just get out of the way. Shrek and Fiona return to her home country of Far Far Away where they are greeted with alarm because King Harold (John Cleese) Queen Lillian (Julie Andrews) and their subjects expected a human un-cursed Princess and a Prince who was if not charming then at least not flatulent. Theres a real Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) though a vain lunkhead cheesed at not getting the girl. And theres a Fairy Godmother whos not quite as helpful as the ones in the old stories -- but then shes voiced by Jennifer Saunders the divine floozy of ""Absolutely Fabulous."" A fairyland CEO with itsy-bitsy wings this Godmother suggests a power-mad Angela Lansbury and if you missed the implied Disney bashing the musical number that rips off rips up and merrily stomps on ""Be Our Guest"" from ""Beauty and the Beast"" should tip you off.What works best in ""Shrek 2"" are the smaller roles the pile-driving pop-culture jokes and the moments of weird early-Mad-magazine comic invention Prince Charming wearing a paper Burger King crown in the background of a scene for example. The CGI animation is painterly and sometimes breathtaking but it lacks the easy brilliance of a Pixar film (so does the script) and the human characters have the ungainly plasticity of Barbie dolls. Theres a reason ""Toy Story"" used toys.There is one inspired new figure though Puss-in-Boots voiced by Antonio Banderas as a sawed-off Castilian dandy who isnt above using Bambi eyes to get what he wants. Half Inigo Montoya half Morris the finicky cat Puss quickly joins our heros side and what starts as a halfhearted Zorro knockoff has become a funny and welcome regular by the final scenes.Eddie Murphys Donkey also takes a while to find his legs and when he does theyre the legs of a white stallion -- but Ill say no more. Shrek goes through some changes too and Myers thankfully keeps the characters vocal showboating to a minimum as though karmically atoning for ""The Cat in the Hat."" But Diaz mostly mopes and Im not sure why one would hire a class act like Andrews and give her nothing to do. Even Cleese is surprisingly un-Cleese-like.As in the first film an inventive pop-rock soundtrack smoothes over the dull patches -- any movie that puts Tom Waitss ""Little Drop of Poison"" into the mouth of a barroom-piano-playing Captain Hook has more on its mind than product placement.Eventually Shreks fairy-tale pals from the first film show up to lend a helping hand and ""Shrek 2"" finally ascends into the comic stratosphere with Pinocchio the Gingerbread Man and the Three Little Pigs all delivering solid guffaws that land on different parts of kids and parents brains.You may be having such a fun time in fact that you dont notice its taking characters from the first film to finally make the second one airborne. ""Shrek 2"" is just good enough to make you worry about the prospect of ""Shrek 3."" Get ready Itll probably be called ""Married With Gremlins."" Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

"Shrek 2 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; shrek-2 ) Shrek 2 (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli A certain amount of credit must be given to the filmmaking team behind Shrek 2 for overcoming a seemingly insurmountable obstacle and producing an entertaining motion picture. That obstacle is the ending of the original Shrek which neatly wrapped up every conceivable aspect of the story leaving little room for a sequel. Originally Shrek had been designed as a one-off movie but when it became a huge hit Dreamworks decided that a second installment was warranted. However with Shrek and Princess Fiona married and living happily ever after as ogres some creative brainstorming had to be done to arrive at a sequel-worthy concept. To be fair Shrek 2 doesnt have much of a storyline. Its basically about the meeting between newlyweds Shrek (voice of Mike Myers) and Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and the brides parents King Harold (John Cleese) and Queen Lillian (Juilie Andrews). To facilitate this encounter Shrek Fiona and Donkey (Eddie Murphy) must travel to the kingdom of Far Far Away. The grotesque appearance of the happy couple isnt to the liking of the ruling family or to studly Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) who wants Fiona for his wife. With a little help from his mom the Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) and a killer cat named Puss n Boots (Antonio Banderas) Charming seeks to win Fiona away from Shrek. Although there isnt much in the way of a plot Shrek 2 is populated with clever and amusing sequences parodies and pop references. Theres a nod to The Lord of the Rings (the forging of Fionas wedding band) and a lampoon of the Oscars Red Carpet (complete with Joan Rivers). Theres a brilliant satire of the ""Cops"" TV show (named ""Knights"") and several opportunities to poke fun at Hollywood (Far Far Away is a medieval version of the eccentric West Coast city). The dialogue includes plenty of double entendres and secondary meanings. The music is laced with contemporary tunes Donkey croons (in his own inimitable fashion) the theme to ""Rawhide"" and the whole cast joins in on ""Livin La Vida Loca."" And what would a Dreamworks animated film be without a few knocks at Disney? This time attentive viewers will catch unflattering glimpses of Ariel (The Little Mermaid) and the duo of Lumiere and Cogsworth (Beauty and the Beast). Its these things not the unimaginative storyline that give Shrek 2 its energy and freshness. The most recognizable vocal talents from the first film are back. Mike Myers again using his Fat Bastard accent returns as the jolly green giant who as a result of a magic potion is presented with the opportunity to temporarily adopt a more pleasing appearance. Cameron Diaz gives Fiona equal parts sweetness and steel. And Eddie Murphy is once again the most annoying ass around and his ability to carry a tune has not improved. This time hes not the only chatty animal. Antonio Banderas gives Puss n Boots his voice (while the animators provide the lifelike mannerisms). Jennifer Saunders makes a perfectly nasty Fairy Godmother. And the duo of John Cleese and Julie Andrews add a touch of class to the production - sort of. (Cleese is given more than one opportunity to act like Basil Fawlty with a crown.) Other familiar faces from the first movie have brief appearances Pinnochio the possessed toy the three blind mice the mirror on the wall the not-so-big bad wolf and the gingerbread man. Plus a few other fairy tale folk join the party. The animation is on the same level as that of Shrek which was in its own time groundbreaking. There havent been many advances in computer animation since then but Shrek 2 hasnt done any backsliding. The film looks as bright and imaginative as its predecessor. The non-humans are surprisingly life-like while the humans still retain the slightly awkward look of something designed on a computer. There are a lot of background jokes; I have a feeling that it will take multiple viewings to uncover some of the more subtle ones. As in the first film its clear that the Shrek animators had fun putting everything together. With its appealing blend of animated comedy romance and adventure Shrek 2 follows the formula of its predecessor while maintaining enough originality not to come across as a direct copy. Fans of the first movie will be pleased. Although Shrek 2 isnt as breezy as Shrek its a respectable effort and a solid example of family-friendly entertainment. The enjoyable animated romp lives up to expectations which is more than can be said for any of its current big-budget multiplex competition.

But now the honeymoon is over Its time for the bride to take her beloved green ogre home to meet the parents.Will Fionas royal kin who expected Prince Charming accept Swamp Thing into the family? Will the guy who eats with his fingers use utensils? Will Fiona find the ogres hut too down-market after a spell at her parents roomy castle? The prospect of meeting fancy in-laws rekindles all of Shreks insecurities about being ugly and unlovable.Shrek is a wreck. But Shrek 2 is a dream a sequel as exhilarating and riotously funny as 2001s top-grossing original.This time the computer-animated features ""accept yourself"" theme cuts even deeper because the filmmakers get to the dyed roots of intolerance. They reveal the secret of why Fionas father King Harold (voice of John Cleese) so anxiously rejects his son-in-law much to his wifes exasperation.""Youre such a drama king"" Queen Lillian (voice of Julie Andrews) tweaks her husband.During the course of its 93 galloping minutes Shrek 2 carries the standard for self-esteem while spoofing showbiz fairy tales self-help books and every other cultural phenom from animal-testing to the Oscars.With their beloved sidekick Donkey (voice of Eddie Murphy) riding shotgun the newlyweds travel to Far Far Away a Fairyland metropolis that resembles a medieval Beverly Hills. The best part of their odd odyssey is the Shreks encounter with Puss-in-Boots hilariously voiced by Antonio Banderas as a cross between Zorro and the Cheshire Cat. His foppish feline gives bounce to this ball.In Far Far Away the streets are lined with gated mansions and retail emporiums such as Farbucks and Barneys Old York. There are even premieres where Fairyland celebs arrive on the red carpet and are greeted by a fashion cop who resembles Joan Rivers. Only Grumpy would fail to laugh when Sleeping Beauty falls out of her carriage face-down on the carpet snoring her narcoleptic song.The pomp and presumption of Far Far Away totally intimidates Shrek who makes the worst first impression imaginable. And thats before he discovers Fionas teenage diary in which she confides her dream of marrying Prince Charming (voice of Rupert Everett) the son of Fairy Godmother (voice of the absolutely fabulous Jennifer Saunders) who is cooking up something in her lab that requires cruelty to animals.Rather than being his colorful carbuncled trumpet-eared self Shrek wants to be the man of Fionas teen dreams. Unlike the wise authors of Shrek 2 he hasnt read Bruno Bettelheims landmark study of fairy tales The Uses of Enchantment.Being oneself is not enough Bettelheim observed. The secret we learn from fairy tales is that happiness is being oneself with another.The improbably moving Shrek both first and second chapters follows its characters as they learn forget and are reminded once again to be comfortable in their own neon-green skin.Like its predecessor Shrek 2 combines eloquence with irreverence striking a unique visual and narrative tone that is both photorealistic and surreal. If the film has a flaw its that Banderas is so friskily funny that he easily hijacks the film from the other characters including Murphys scene-stealing Donkey.Whatever you do dont walk out during the credits The after-party is happening.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.Shrek 2  1/2 (out of four stars)Produced by David Lipman Aron Warner and John H.

Running time 92 minutes. Rated PG (fart jokes). At the Chelsea the Union Square The Kips Bay others. --- SHREK 2"" the inevitable sequel to the 2001 hit is so gorgeously animated and so thoroughly entertaining for all ages that only an ogre would complain its not quite as fresh as the original. The follow-up which opens tomorrow after premiering over the weekend at the Cannes Film Festival follows a very familiar path as it picks up the story of Shrek the ogre (voiced again by Mike Myers) and Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) now a full-time ogre after their fairy-tale marriage at the end of the first movie. After their honeymoon - depicted in a hilarious montage - the couple is invited by her parents to a ball celebrating their marriage in the Kingdom of Far Far Away. A very reluctant Shrek sets out with Fiona and the stillannoying Donkey (Eddie Murphy) for the kingdom an amusing if obvious spoof of Beverly Hills complete with stores like Versarchery Saxxon Fifth Avenue and Tower of London Records. Predictably King Harold (John Cleese) and Queen Lillian (Julie Andrews) are less than thrilled at their new son-in-law much less the fact that their daughter is now an ogre. The big-hearted Lillian is willing to make adjustments but the king is furious that by rescuing Fiona from a dragon and her castle prison in the earlier film our hero upset his plot to have her rescued by the egotistical Prince Charming (Rupert Everett). The king turns out to be in cahoots with the princes mother Fairy Godmother (an excellent Jennifer Saunders) who runs a potions factory and advertises her services on billboards. While she plots to eliminate Shrek the king enlists the services of a professional ogre killer the swashbuckling Puss-in-Boots (Antonio Banderas in a comic tour de force that spoofs his role as Zorro). Shrek easily wins over the adorably cute Puss much to the chagrin of Donkey who complains ""The position of annoying talking animal is already taken."" With Puss help Shrek and Donkey steal a magic potion from Fairy Godmother that turns Shrek into a hunky human and Fiona back into her old beautiful self. Along the way there are countless clever pop references movie spoofs (everything from ""From Here to Eternity"" to ""Ghostbusters"") and voice cameos by the likes of Larry King (as an Ugly Stepsister now tending bar) and Joan Rivers (as herself working the red carpet at the marriage ball). The kids will be able to figure out how the patchwork plot plays out but its still great fun - even if making fun of Disney and its characters has become something of a national sport over the past three years (though the Michael Eisner-like Lord Farquadd voiced by John Lithgow is sorely missed in the sequel). And the stunningly detailed computer animation is a quantum leap over the work in the original which won the first Oscar for Best Animated Feature. Directors Andrew Adamson Kelly Asbury and Conrad Vernon have delivered a visual knockout that rarely fails to dazzle and the voice work is superb. But storywise theres a feeling of gently diminishing returns - to the point that by promising both ""Shrek 3"" due in 2006 and ""Shrek 4"" also on the drawing boards its valid to fear DreamWorks may be overworking the Golden Goose.

Married at the end of ""Shrek"" (2001) the big ugly title ogre (Mike Myers) and his ungainly bride Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) head back to the Kingdom of Far Far Away--with the ever-funny Donkey (Eddie Murphy) in tow--to meet her folks the King (John Cleese) and Queen (Julie Andrews).But the royal parents assume that the preening Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) is the one who broke the curse on their tower-confined daughter so theyre expecting to greet a Barbie-thin Fiona alongside her new hunk o man not a pair of lime-colored ogres. Plus Prince Charmings mom the Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) is vexed and ready to hex.""Shrek 2"" is a solid if not groundbreaking yarn less discordant than the first one but also less surprising. I was put off by the first movies cynicism in making lots of short jokes and then moralizing about accepting everyones appearance. In ""Shrek 2"" the desires to amuse kids and adults dont seem so much at odds.But the repurposing of fairy-tale characters--atop even more abundant movie TV and celebrity culture references--doesnt feel as fresh. The filmmakers also depict the Kingdom of Far Far Away as a mock version of Beverly Hills--ho-hum.""Shrek 2"" is better looking than its predecessor though DreamWorks computer animation still isnt at Pixars level.

They are not generally ""about"" anything but their precursory movie the receipts it gathered and the infantile comfort audiences experience in revisiting favorite characters whether or not they are inhabiting a film worth the attention of an encephalopathic hen. Thus The Whole Ten Yards say isnt a comedy but a sequel just as Shrek 2 is a sequel and not a . . . whatever the hell the first one was--a fluorescent foam-rubber gargantua spawned in a fructose-stoked nightmare from the modest pages of William Steigs sketchy little book badly drafted opportunistic and cross-marketed into a rapacious consumerist howl. Perhaps because it barely qualifies as a film on its own Shrek 2 is more easily tolerated--it fulfills its scant sequel obligations without breaking a sweat and thereafter concerns itself with wacky non sequitur. Shrek himself composed of swollen-cute Babe Ruth-ness and Mike Myerss limp and context-less burr remains this plasticene universes least interesting creation. The plot he waddles through is a haphazard jerry-rigging of cross purposes betrayals accidents and impromptu gags centering on Shreks in-law problems and a scheming fairy godmothers plans for Princess Fiona--now Mrs. Shrek--to wed her son Charming. Pretensions toward cohesion and character empathy are scuttled in favor of broad-barn gaggery The in-laws kingdom is a Mother Goose Hollywood complete with punning product placements and Oscar night red carpet; Charming is a Rupert Everett-voiced showbiz fop; a seedy gin mill has Captain Hook playing a Tom Waits song on the piano and a headless man burping beer from an abyss between his shoulders. As before exec producer Jeffrey Katzenberg--apparently still peeved about that half-billion in Disney profits he didnt get from Mike Eisner--mocks Magic Kingdom tropes (Beauty and the Beast takes a slight flogging) other movies are pointlessly quoted (look for the LOTR-isms and then wonder why you bothered) and song interludes are so ubiquitous they virtually play over one another. Some of the buckshot hits its target Shreks second sidekick assassin-turned-comrade Puss in Boots is voiced by Antonio Banderas as an outrageously mock-dramatic Spaniard with most of the pig-pile screenplays best toss-offs and Eddie Murphys Donkey still has the right timing to go with his undersized eyes and oversized teeth. The movie flirts with a certain variety of communal joy when the Big Bad Wolf Three Pigs Three Blind Mice et al. show up for the climactic showdown--a brief Mission Impossible rescue that involves getting Pinocchio to grow his nose may be this skit-messs reckless high point. That is if you can resist the redoubtable spectacle of Puss heaving a hair ball in mid duel.

Browse over 8 million products  Clothing amp; Jewelry  Computers amp; Electronics  Home amp; Garden  Kids amp; Family Shrek 2 A fairy tale come true for audiencesBy Claudia Puig USA TODAY Its a rare sequel that is as good as its predecessor but DreamWorks Shrek 2 (    stars out of four) is just as funny sweet and engaging as the first film starring the big galoot. Shrek (voiced by Mike Meyers) finds a new sidekick in the lovable but scrappy Puss-In-Boots (Antonio Banderas). DreamWorks But in this one the lovable green giant (voiced again by Mike Myers) and his neurotic donkey pal (reprised by Eddie Murphy) are upstaged by the resplendent Puss In Boots (Antonio Banderas). Shrek and Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) are on their honeymoon. The sequences in which they gambol through scenic spots are a great send-up of all the corny montages of live-action movies. The first film had similar moments but Shrek 2 takes things a step further with an homage to From Here to Eternity. But that nod is then turned on its ear with another cinematic reference that takes a jab at Disney animation. Viewers also will have fun catching Shrek 2s mini-tributes to Spider-Man The Wizard of Oz The Lord of the Rings and Charlies Angels. Returning from their romantic idyll Shrek and Princess Fiona are summoned by Fionas parents the king and queen of the Kingdom of Far Far Away (a fairy-tale version of Beverly Hills). Donkey cannot resist tagging along and whining most of the way. John Cleese and Julie Andrews are pitch-perfect as the royal couple who are taken aback when they learn that their princess has married an ogre and become one too. Andrews Queen Lillian has a dignified kindly air while the curmudgeonly King Harold immediately locks horns with Shrek. The king had plans for Fionas future enlisting the aid of the megalomaniac Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders). She had designs on the royal title herself involving her foppish son Prince Charming (a very funny Rupert Everett). The king also calls upon famous ogre hunter Puss In Boots but the courtly feline eventually joins forces with Shrek much to Donkeys dismay. The tabby cat with the fancy plumed hat has an exotic Spanish accent -- and Banderas parodies his earlier role as Zorro. But Puss is a cute kitty when he wants to get his way in scenes that prompt a theater-full of ""awwws."" Such manipulation might have seemed cloying if Puss were not equally adept at clawing when the need arises. His funniest bit is a role in a wild take-off of TVs Cops. As in the original Shrek 2s musical score is first-rate with songs by Counting Crows and Tom Waits as well as retooled old hits. And the computer animation is gorgeous. A high-spirited fun-filled comedy adventure Shrek 2 probably will emerge as summers best family film. (PG for some crude humor a brief substance reference and some suggestive content. Opens in many theaters at midnight tonight Wednesday nationwide.)

Original pulled in 480 million and DreamWorks will be able to ride anticipation alone to numbers approaching those in the end. Ancillary reps a gold mine. Lightning strikes twice but not as brilliantly as before in ""Shrek 2."" The welcome sequel to the monster 2001 Oscar winner about an ogres unlikely romance with a beautiful princess successfully recycles many of the qualities that made the first one an instant animated classic and worldwide smash. But despite the great pleasure provided by all the familiar returning characters and some nifty new ones as well the anarchic humor isnt quite as fresh or abundant this time around and the message is identical. Original pulled in 480 million worldwide 268 million of that in the U.S. making it the fourth-biggest-grossing computer-animated pic of all time and DreamWorks will be able to ride anticipation alone to numbers approaching but likely not equaling those in the end. Ancillary once again reps a gold mine. It was inevitable that any follow-up to ""Shrek"" would start with the honeymoon of Shrek and his bride Fiona now ogrefied in her mates own image after the uproarious climactic events of the original film. And the sequel achieves its highest hilarity quotient during the opening-minutes montage which includes some clever throwaway homages such as a mermaid getting between the two ardent lovers during a ""From Here to Eternity"" wave-swept embrace and which sees their pal Donkey obnoxiously overstaying his welcome once the couple return to settle down in Shreks cottage. Due to this peppy opening and the striking reminder of how brilliantly vivid the colors and designs were in the first picture (something that comes across stunningly in digital projection) one relaxes into the comfort of director Andrew Adamsons helming working without original co-helmer Vicky Jenson but joined this time by Kelly Asbury and Conrad Vernon. Buoyant feeling persists as the principals make an overland journey far far away to meet Fionas parents the king and queen of a place literally called Far Far Away (and so signified by a Hollywood-style sign on the mountainside) where a royal ball is scheduled in their honor. Of course mom and dad (aptly voiced by Julie Andrews and John Cleese) have no clue as to their daughters recent transformation nor to the nature of the hombre shes married. This gives Shrek intense pause about making the trip at all and the shocked reaction of the royals and the populace gathered to meet their carriage fully justifies his fears. Its only less-happily-ever-after from there. The foursomes awkward introductory dinner spirals into a food-flinging disaster Shrek surreptitiously reads his wifes handsome prince-obsessed childhood diary and Fionas Fairy Godmother (a devilishly good Jennifer Saunders) gets into the act by scheming with the king to eliminate Shrek so his daughter can fulfill her destiny by marring Prince Charming (the humorously vain Rupert Everett) who just happens to be her son. The kings solution to this is to hire the mercenary swordsman and legendary ogre killer Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas deliciously sending up his Zorro persona). At their first meeting Puss literally gets his claws into the hitherto unflappable Shrek but the green one quickly domesticates the diminutive feline and enlists him to battle the Fairy Godmother whose all-purpose wand and vast store of secret potions makes her the most powerful force in the kingdom. So far so good. But beginning with the newlyweds nervous arrival and subsequent rocky first night at the castle a certain conventionality and easy familiarity lightly cloud the proceedings. What were amusing but unstressed digs at Disney in the Lord Farquaad interludes of the first film become overdone borderline hypocritical digs at commercialdom when the couple arrives at the City Walk-like royal city. Further the story for too long remains grounded in the familiar in-laws dynamics of ""Meet the Parents"" and a host of other comedies. Puss in Boots becoming so quickly neutered also takes a little air out of the balloon. Doing her best to elevate the proceedings is Fairy Godmother a woman of a certain age with stylishly swept-back gray hair glasses perched skeptically down her nose and constantly whirring wings keeping her airborne like a hummingbird. Her mind works just as fast especially when scheming is required and the way she maneuvers Fiona into position to marry her preening blond-maned son despite the princesss love for Shrek is worthy of the most cunning storybook characters. But Shrek and his ""annoying talking animal"" cohorts prove themselves capable adversaries making off with some ""Happily Ever After"" potion from the Godmothers lab. A stiff dose of the stuff not only turns Shrek into a strappingly handsome leading man type and Donkey into a glorious white stallion but Fiona back into her beauteous old self. Meanwhile Godmother tries to convince Fiona that Prince Charming actually is Shrek and action climax hinges on whether or not Shrek will make it back to the castle before Fiona capitulates to the prince. Finale also sees a host of fairy tale characters reentering the fray sometimes to vastly amusing effect. Whereas the first ""Shrek"" benefited from the forward momentum provided by its journey format second installment scripted by Adamson and previous collaborator Joe Stillman along with newcomers J. David Stern and David N. Weiss flows less smoothly with Fiona stuck in a dither at the castle while Shrek and his allies bounce around the land looking for a solution to his dilemma. Format provides plenty of opportunity for incident but some of it seems self-consciously wrenched into existence rather than having grown organically out of character and situation. Still the appeal of the characters and the abundance of cleverness in the telling will keep viewers grinning if not always laughing through most of the picture. Once again Mike Myers as Shrek Eddie Murphy as Donkey and Cameron Diaz as Fiona provide full value with their enthusiastic voicings and all the newcomers jump in with the proper spirit with Saunders getting the bonus of some rambunctious musical interludes. A couple of notable cameos include Larry King as a transvestite ""Ugly Stepsister"" bartender and Joan Rivers as herself as a commentator at the royal ball. Visually pic may be even more vibrant than the first edition with the colors and backgrounds leaping off the screen in nearly hyper-realistic fashion; numerous moments of photographic visual precision are almost unsettling in their detail. Design elements from the imaginative costumes and glittering backgrounds to the highly articulated character work are superb but while Harry Gregson-Williams score is inventively invigorating some of the pop song choices are uncharacteristically underwhelming for a franchise that sets its own bar so high.

Heres what youd get in return Ninety percent of the cards would be blank. Of the remaining 10 percent no card would agree with any other card. Thats the dreary reality of this sequel to the wondrous ""Shrek"" of three years ago a piecemeal plot that seems to go nowhere and be about nothing and wind up no place somewhat effectively camouflaged by a number of intriguing but incidental bits. Oh it looks great. The pixies of pixelism at DreamWorks Animation know their stuff and can conjure up anything imaginable. The forms of the creatures are sinuous and convincing their movements dynamic and frequently witty. The landscapes boast that eerie blend of the mythically resonant and palpable as if distilled from N.C. Wyeths id. The dwellings and urban landscapes are devilishly clever. The new breakthrough seems to be skin blemishes and whiskers because the beings human and mythic have conspicuously reality-TV skin instead of that dead luster that seems endemic to the computer-generated world. So yes Mr. and Mrs. America in accordance with your wishes the geniuses at DreamWorks can now give you animated acne The story -- hmm well lets see where to begin how to proceed where to end? Since the filmmakers botched all of these why should anyone expect me to be able to bring this off? As best as I can figure out there is no overarching overall ultimately satisfying story in the global sense. Theres certainly nothing like the quest-structure of redemption through rescue that energized the first film to say nothing of 7908987098765887 or so stories before it. Rather throughout ""Shrek 2s"" plot patterns are engineered along a single model the arbitrary emplacement of a minor obstacle to be overcome in about a 10-minute sequence. At that point equally arbitrarily a new minor obstacle is created then overcome in 10 more minutes and so forth for 90 minutes or so. When you get there theres no there there and there never was a there there so you wonder Why did we just go there? The movie is at least a pure sequel following immediately upon the completion of what preceded it. It seems that upon waking up on the first night of their honeymoon our favorite ogres the just-married Mr. and Mrs. Shrek -- the former Princess Fiona voiced in a lackluster performance by Cameron Diaz -- are invited -- commanded that is by royal decree -- to go to her parents castle in Far Far Away Land for a wedding ball in their honor. The royal parents (the voices belong to John Cleese unrecognizable and Julie Andrews so recognizable you wait for her to burst into ""The Sound of Music"" which incidentally would have been preferable to any of the tunes the movie itself offers) are horrified to discover that their new son-in-law is 12 feet tall green and has trumpets for ears. Even worse is that so does their daughter. At this point the movie takes a very strange twist then pretty much forgets about it. The king -- an unseemly little man with a weak weaselly face -- hires a professional assassin to kill Shrek. Yukkk Isnt this a little much for what is essentially a fairy tale for children? Need we segue into Greek tragedy with a gambit so intense and violent? Well evidently the storytellers -- three are listed on the screenplay under the direction of three more directors for a total of six -- were frightened of what they had wrought as well and after playing with that one for the allotted 10 minutes they jettison it altogether and the killer -- Puss-in-Boots (the voice of Antonio Banderas) -- joins Shrek (the voice of Mike Myers) and the Donkey (likewise Eddie Murphy) and the two caballeros become three amigos. But why? Literally I dont know; the insertion of the third member into the previous twosome adds nothing and really just gets in the way of the amusing chemistry between Murphy and Myers. It also turns out that while Myers and particularly Murphy are terrific vocal performers Banderas isnt. Too frequently you cannot understand him and theres no real impulse to do so because his interaction with the story is so tenuous to begin with. Finally at about the 40-minute mark what seems to be a plot begins to emerge It seems that an evil Fairy Godmother wants her vain worthless peacock of a son Prince Charming to marry Princess Fiona and shes the one who accelerates the plot against Shrek which has its climax at that fancy ball. None of this is particularly engaging and the Fairy Godmother (voiced by Jennifer Saunders) is the only compelling figure in the film because shes the only one doing something direct; the others are quite passive reacting (barely) to her initiatives. What does engage are the riffs which makes a good point about the nature of commercial storytelling. In fact ""Shrek 2"" is almost a clinical study of storytelling tendencies. In this as in all concoctions meant to delight provoke entertain fascinate or whatever basically two aspects of a good story come into play. One Id call global Its the central dramatic situation the arc of story in which one makes an emotional investment. Thats the key in most stories but here its way underdeveloped. Whats overdeveloped is the second aspect which I call local. Its better known as the business. You know the riffs the things the conceits the styles if you will. And at this lesser enterprise ""Shrek 2"" shines. Its most elaborate and amusing conceit sees Far Far Away Land as an elaborate metaphorized version of Hollywood complete with the palms the mansions (with fairy-tale heroes and heroines as ""stars"") the fast-food joints the famous sign spilling across the green hills (fiction the hills arent normally green but a kind of thatchy brown the color of a cicadas thorax). The ""dress ball"" to continue the visual merriment is seen as a kind of Oscar ceremony with amusing coach-limo vehicles delivering the celebs to a red carpet as a Joan Rivers type dishes their outfits. Thats extremely enjoyable for its pure wit and energy and somehow as clever as it is its not enough. One wishes the same wit and energy had gone into the story. Thats ""Shrek 2"" in a nutshell -- very pretty to look at very hard to care for. Shrek 2 (94 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG and contains nothing really objectionable though there is some crude humor and suggestive content.
