Comments Kangaroo Jack Brooklyn buddies owe a mobster a favor so they hop a plane to down under--cue the Men at Work song--to deliver an envelope. The films best bit has the errand boys crammed in the jets lavatory as they discover 50000 inside the envelope; excitedly calling the money ""shit"" and reveling in its aroma they sound like scat fetishists to an eavesdropping stewardess. In the outback they pose for a snapshot with a kangaroo which bounds away wearing a jacket with the envelope in its pocket. Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer this likable but negligible lark was briskly directed by David McNally (Coyote Ugly). Australia is stocked with stereotyped characters and camels are burdened with fart jokes; presumably foreign audiences will cheer every time the computer-generated roo sucker punches the clueless Yanks. With Jerry OConnell Anthony Anderson Estella Warren Christopher Walken Dyan Cannon and David Ngoombujarra. 89 min.

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

Directed by David McNally from a screenplay by Steve Bing and Scott Rosenberg. 89 minutes. Rated PG for language crude humor sensuality and violence. Several theaters. Every movie has something to teach us and from ""Kangaroo Jack"" we learn this Hairdressers even low-rent Brooklyn hairdressers traveling in Australia on a mission from the mob (yes Im getting to that) always have a pair of scissors concealed somewhere on their person just in case they need to provide an emergency bang trim or something. At least this is true in Steve Bing and Scott Rosenbergs boneheaded screenplay in which it seems that the only reason for making the main character a hairdresser is so that he can whip out those scissors and cut a crucial rope late in the movie. Imagine the script meetings Hmm if hes a plumber or an insurance salesman or an architect how does he cut that rope? Hey Lets make him a hairdresser And then we can throw in some gratuitous hairdresser jokes Now weve got a movie Um well yes you have a movie if thats what you want to call a collection of tepid chase scenes perked up sadly by moments of camel flatulence. Charlie (Jerry OConnell bland as ever) and Louis (Anthony Anderson) a pair of childhood buddies accidentally tip off the Brooklyn cops to Charlies Mafia stepdads stash of stolen loot. (Christopher Walken as stepdad Sal speaks in bad-movie-mobster cadences and looks just a bit embarrassed as well he should.) The guys are given a chance to redeem themselves Deliver 50000 to a Mr. Smith in remote Australia theyre told and the mob will forgive them. Once in the outback our intrepid pair encounters a CGI-created kangaroo who hops off with the 50000. (Maybe Im out of touch with mobster finance but this seems like an awfully lame amount for two people to be risking their lives over no?) More complications ensue involving camels dingos a drunken helicopter pilot and a very beautiful wildlife scientist (Estella Warren) who provides a love interest for Charlie and a textbook example of bad acting for the rest of us. Warren a former model last seen in ""Planet of the Apes"" smiles sweetly when delivering her perfectly expressionless lines as if apologizing in advance. From the movies title and its ubiquitous poster and trailer youd think the kangaroo played a crucial role; actually hes barely in the movie has no personality and only sings and dances once in a brief fantasy sequence. Far more entertaining are the camels loftily dignified creatures who deserve far better than to be the target of fart jokes. They eye the camera elegantly as if its an inferior creature that nonetheless holds their interest. Somebody get these animals an agent -- theyve got more charisma than anyone else in this cast. For the record my 7-year-old companion loved this movie (weve agreed to disagree on it) especially the bathroom humor. But ""Kangaroo Jack"" leaves a few unanswered questions. Such as does Christopher Walken really need a gig this badly? And if those camels got together and wrote a screenplay would it be better than this one? To the second question I say let em try.

Starring Jerry OConnell Anthony Anderson Estella Warren. Directed by David McNally. (PG. 84 minutes. At Bay Area theaters). At one point in the lame comedy ""Kangaroo Jack"" a character holds up a cylinder filled with liquid animal tranquilizer. Every viewer man child or marsupial will know instantly that the tranquilizer will end up somewhere it shouldnt. Guessing which character will get it is one way to kill time during this terrible would-be kids movie. Another is figuring out how long it took CGI animators to turn a lovely animal the kangaroo into something vulgar and vaguely creepy. These thoughts will shave at least five minutes of boredom from the movies otherwise interminable 84-minute running time. The kangaroo has hopped off with 50000 cash which had been transported to Australia by a Brooklyn mobsters hapless stepson (Jerry OConnell) and sidekick (Anthony Anderson). In case its unclear that this is Australia there are cutaway shots of koalas accompanied by Men at Works ""Land Down Under"" a novelty song from 20 years ago that has grown sinister in its overuse. How did the kangaroo end up with the money? Well thats an unfunny story already familiar as an urban myth. Having accidentally hit the animal with their Jeep the guys dress it up in a baseball jacket and sunglasses and take photos. The animal revives and heads off with the jacket and cash. The pairs search for the kangaroo and a subsequent hunt for them by the mobsters henchmen take up most of the movie. The kangaroo presumably the reason kids would want to see this movie has more of a cameo role. Less turns out to be better because computer effects have reduced a magnificent animal to a cartoon comic foil with human expressions and a yen for red licorice. It might not look so weird if the picture didnt have so many shots of real kangaroos. That the CGI kangaroo resembles Joe Camel of the cigarette ads only increases a sense of unease. OConnell (TVs ""Crossing Jordan"") and Anderson (""Barbershop"") seem game enough but their collective charisma isnt enough to carry a good-quality movie much less a dud like this. Fish-out-of-water comedies work only when the fish are believable in their own pond. OConnell and Anderson appear to have come not from Brooklyn but from a Hollywood sitcom factory that churns out genial unthreatening actors devoid of regional traits. ""Kangaroo Jack"" was co-written by Steve Bing the rich guy who fathered Elizabeth Hurleys son but once denied his paternity. His efforts here reveal no particular affinity for children. Then again its hard to tell whom this movie targets given its innuendo and unlikely romance between OConnells character and a wildlife expert. Shes played by Estella Warren (""Planet of the Apes"") she of the vivid features and wan acting ability. Seeing Warren in a clingy T-shirt makes one wistful for ""Coyote Ugly"" the picture that director David McNally made before this one. At least that film had some life in it. Proving that yes he will take any role Christopher Walken plays OConnells mafioso stepfather. He also provides one of the films few lively moments when his self-improving goomba confuses ""anathema"" and ""plethora"" in a sentence. Only Walkens wacko line readings could sell such a stupid gag. . This film contains violence raunchy humor.

But Jack is probably the only one wearing a red ""Brooklyn"" jacket with 50000 of Mob money in it. Lead Jerry OConnell still living down last years Tomcats plays the hairdresser stepson of hoodlum chieftain Christopher Walken. OConnell plays the lifelong best friend of trouble-bait Anthony Anderson who in the course of the movie performs two cannonballs into separate bodies of water. Anderson also takes part in this kid-oriented comedys almost obligatory flatulence jokes. Is this the best an agent can do? Review of the movie Kangaroo Jack ( out of four) Stars Jerry OConnell Anthony Anderson Estella Warren Christopher Walken Bill Hunter Director David McNally Distributor Warner Bros. Rating PG for language crude humor sensuality and violence. Opens Friday nationwide Both buds end up in the Australian outback though not before a New York car chase that cuts to the shot weve seen at least 10 times a year Two guys going ""Aaaaaaahhhhhh"" just before a crash. Then both spend the rest of the movie chasing Jack aided by a large-lipped American looker in khaki shorts (Estella Warren). Adventures in planes and jeeps ensue as computer-generated kangaroos hop across the screen. Young children will like the hubbub and probably the flatulence but grim-faced grown-ups might share sentiments with grizzled Australian character actor Bill Hunter who plays a pilot. His comment after being thrown from a moving vehicle ""I should have never left the pub.""

Posted January 15 2003 -- 1200 AM EST Christopher Walken plays a small role as a gangster in the junky kids comedy Kangaroo Jack and every moment hes on the screen is a marvel of charisma over crap. As he did last year in ""The Country Bears"" the cosmically uncategorizable actor (a possible Oscar nominee for his tender supporting performance in ""Catch Me if You Can"") provides brief oases of adult pleasure in a desert of shrill juvenile jokes and clanging chase sequences. The Jack of the title (who by the way isnt a talker contrary to the misleading TV commercials) is an Australian marsupial in temporary possession of a jacket containing 50000 usually worn by Louis Fucci (Anthony Anderson) whos the best friend of Charlie Carbone (Jerry OConnell) whos the gangsters hairdresser stepson from Brooklyn sent Down Under to...like it matters. What does matter to those fascinated by such trivia is that this charmless expense-deductible business trip to Australia was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer (now branching out into action junk for kids) and cowritten by Steve Bing (penning a lullaby for his son with Elizabeth Hurley?). Also ""Kangaroo Jack"" costars Estella Warren as a wildlife conservationist who in the interests of PG swims in an opaque white tank top and flirts demurely with Charlie.

Lowbrow kid-skewing comedy likely will earn small change from small fry during brief theatrical run. For auds unwilling or unable to grapple with the subtle nuances of ""Scooby Doo"" Warners now gives us ""Kangaroo Jack"" a shrill and silly farce in which a CGI marsupial seems more lifelike than most of its flesh-and-blood co-stars. Lowbrow kid-skewing comedy likely will earn small change from small fry during brief theatrical run before hopping off to greener pastures in homevid realm. Jerry OConnell plays Charlie Carbone a Brooklyn-born hairdresser whos deeply indebted to Sal Maggio (Christopher Walken) his mob boss stepfather. As if this criminal connection werent problematical enough Charlie also is recklessly loyal to Louis Booker (Anthony Anderson) a long-time friend whos a full-time hustler. Early on Charlie rashly agrees to help Louis deliver a truckload of hot merchandise thereby triggering a high-speed pursuit by dozens of NYPD squad cars. (The resulting demolition derby -- involving an unseemly number of auto crashes -- serves as a none-too subtle reminder that this is after all a Jerry Bruckheimer production.) Charlie and Louis inadvertently lead the cops to a warehouse stocked with stolen goods. A warehouse of course that just happens to be operated by Charlies stepfather. To punish the troublesome bumblers Sal sends Charlie and Louis off to a remote spot in Australia to deliver a cash-stuffed envelope to a mysterious Mr. Smith (Martin Csokas). As they drive through the Outback however the none-too-bright heroes accidentally hit a kangaroo with their car. Thinking the poor critter has joined the Choir Invisible the friends pause to take pictures of themselves with the beast. Indeed theyre such jolly jokesters they place Louis ""lucky jacket"" on the fallen roo and snap a few more photos. Surprise The seemingly deceased marsupial stirs to life and hops away while still wearing the jacket. Naturally the cash-stuffed envelope is inside one of the jackets pockets which means Charlie and Louis spend the rest of the movie trying to tie that kangaroo down. In this ensuing duel of wits the dumb-and-dumber buddies are repeatedly outmatched. OConnell and Anderson convey the haplessness of their characters with broad bug-eyed performances that make one yearn for the delicate restraint of the Three Stooges. At best theyre annoying; at worst appalling. Andersons character a stereotypical fat black man might have played well with Mississippi audiences in 1948 but many viewers today will be less amused. The wacky buddies seek assistance from a beautiful wildlife specialist (Estella Warren) a grizzled bush pilot (Bill Hunter) and a guide with a secret agenda (David Ngoombujarra). Unfortunately these supporting characters arent sufficiently funny or developed enough to score much impact and the actors cast in the roles simply go through the motions. As Sal Walken adds yet another self-mockingly spooky/crazy role to his resume. He has a couple of comical moments -- note his canny throwaway delivery of a line referring to Charlies beauty-school education -- but he appeared more engaged in ""The Country Bears."" Working from a clumsily contrived script by Steve Bing and Scott Rosenberg helmer David McNally (""Coyote Ugly"") underscores every piece of comic business with a enthusiasm bordering on desperation. Jokes about camel flatulence and full-cavity searches typify pics overall level of humor. (By the way this is second pic of 2003 -- after ""Just Married"" -- to feature a slapsticky sequence in a jetliner lavatory. And its only January) Tech values -- including attractive lensing of Aussie countryside by Peter Menzies Jr. -- are mostly first-rate. Thanks to the CGI wizards title character is seamlessly inserted into live-action scenes. And creatures quizzical expressions often are genuinely amusing. Taking its cue from a similar scene in ""Snow Dogs"" pic enhances its kid appeal by including a dream sequence in which the kangaroo speaks sings and -- no kidding -- breakdances.
