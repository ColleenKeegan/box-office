This lavish screen version of Andrew Lloyd Webbers musical is so chockablock with decorative detail the human figures are often competing with the decor for attention Baroque balustrades flower-strewn dressing rooms a chandelier to end all chandeliers and the title characters murky subterranean grotto which depending on your point of view evokes either a brooding 19th-century painting or a new Disneyland ride. Sometimes the sets win but not when Emmy Rossum is around as Christine the lovely chorus girl whom the disfigured Phantom (Gerard Butler)--her mysterious ""Angel of Music""--is molding into the Paris Operas next great star. The 18-year-old may not have the acting chops of a seasoned pro but with a pure-as-crystal soprano voice to match her dark beauty shes a heart-stopping presence.What can I tell the millions of fans whove made Lloyd Webbers breast-beating musical the most successful stage show in history (3.3 billion and counting)? As someone who just doesnt get it--its kitschy romanticism bored me on Broadway and it bores me here--I may not be the most reliable witness. Still I can easily imagine a more dashing charismatic Phantom than Butlers. A shouter he lacks mystery and without it the love triangle with Christine and Patrick Wilsons ardent Raoul is a non-starter. Rest assured how-ever Lloyd Webbers neo-Puccinian songs--ravishingly recorded under Simon Lees baton--are all there reprised and reprised and reprised until youre guaranteed to go out humming.

On film nothings impossible so its correspondingly hard to make an audience gasp. Its not so hard to make them laugh though even a sympathetic preview house sniggered when the hideously deformed phantoms mask was torn from his face to reveal - gasp - a case of nettle rash and a broadish nose of the type considered endearing on an adolescent Hayley Mills.The prospect of semi-grand guignol set in the already overblown world of opera (the shows music sounds paltry in hypothetical comparison) prompts Joel Schumacher to pile on gothic vaults subterranean chapels snowy cemeteries and set-piece costume balls dithering between Moulin Rouge lushness and campy latter-day Hammer. Numbingly predictable couplets squelch into bathos; pantomime sounds like TS Eliot in comparison. The mewling heroine Emmy Rossum (or more accurately given her state of semi-animation Possum) wears a simper as inexpressive as the Phantoms mask and young Raoul (Patrick Wilson) also tries to disturb his waxwork loveliness as little as possible. Minnie Driver as a temperamental diva steals every joyous moment she can but Gerard Butlers Phantom is elusive beyond the call of duty - feebly vocalised uncharismatic. Theres one good line as the heroine leaps into a cab Take me to my fathers grave please. Try it on a London cabbie.

"Phantom Hits the Right Notes washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids Phantom Hits the Right Notes Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 24 2004 DONT BE AFRAID ""Andrew Lloyd Webbers The Phantom of the Opera"" isnt just for music fans. Its more accessible than that thanks to Joel Schumachers bright direction and a few storytelling embellishments. But remember You are reading the review of a Phantom rube who knows next to nothing about Phantom-iana (note to self Check Amazon.com for a "" Phantom for Dummies"" book) and would only go to a stage musical at gunpoint. As for hardcore Phantomaniacs (theyve read Gaston Lerouxs original book own a signed poster of Lon Chaney have built a Sarah Brightman shrine in their living room attended 14 stage productions in London and New York and so on) I know theyll have their druthers. Some lyrics are spoken some songs have been trimmed and the big expansive gestures required for stage musicals have been pared to subtler levels to suggest just a few potential areas of impassioned debate. But theres still a sense of a big show here. The sets costumes and decor are lavish. Emmy Rossum (Christine) and Gerard Butler (the Phantom) may not hold a candle to Brightman and Michael Crawford (stars of the renowned 1980s stage show directed by Harold Prince). And this phantom is something of a stud with a teeny mask that hides little more than a mild skin problem. But the two are pretty and peppy. (You were looking for depth?) And to this set of tin ears at least Rossum a trained opera singer has an impressive set of pipes. The year is 1919. (Schumacher films this opening sequence persuasively in grainy black-and-white to mirror the silent movies of that time.) Pariss Opera Populaire has fallen into seedy disrepair. Two significant and aged characters Madame Giry (Miranda Richardson) and Raoul (Patrick Wilson) enter the rundown building to attend an auction. Some of the items include a mechanical music box with a cymbal-clapping monkey and a huge dusty chandelier under a shroud. Ahh that chandelier The one that illuminated the glorious world of opera circa 1870. And back in time we go . . . . . . To the days when the opera was a thriving industry of performers chorus girls set decorators stagehands and well-dressed audiences. (The color returns to the movie.) As we enter this time stroppy diva Carlotta (an enjoyably over-the-top Minnie Driver) is upset about this and that and the operas new owners (Ciaran Hinds and Simon Callow) are desperately trying to placate her. When she refuses to perform that night someone suggests Christine for a replacement. She knows the routines the songs everything. Christines immediate success on stage reunites her with childhood sweetheart Raoul de Chagny (Wilson again) who happens to be the Operas patron. But Christine is also in thrall to another presence the spectral Angel of Music (aka the Phantom) who lives in the basement. He trained Christine as a girl. Hell do anything to further her career. Watch out Carlotta. And watch out Raoul The Phantom doesnt just like her singing. There is much more to come as Christine struggles with her conflicted passions (Good guy? Bad guy? Good skin? Bad skin?) and the Phantom makes threatening demands on the company. Christine he declares must remain the star or woe betide everyone. There are some secrets of the past to be uncovered known only to the Phantom and Madame Giry (also Richardson). And of course there are the songs -- most of the reason people have turned Lloyd Webbers original show into the best-selling musical ever. Its now in its 18th year playing on stages around the world. Director Schumacher who wrote the screenplay with Lloyd Webber (also the main producer of the movie) was given a tough job. He knew that ""Phantom"" needed little selling to the already converted. But he also knew they had to be satisfied. And then there are the cultural cavemen like me who havent paid attention to Lloyd Webber since Ted Neeley and Carl Anderson locked vocal horns in the stage and movie versions of ""Jesus Christ Superstar."" All in all this ""Phantom"" seems to be a satisfying solution. ANDREW LLOYD WEBBERS THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA (PG-13 140 minutes) -- Contains some brief violent images. Area theaters.

A handful of maddeningly catchy tunes did triple and quadruple duty suggesting often contradictory emotions love and malevolence resolution and anxiety. When words are set willy-nilly to repetitive music you dont pay much attention to them -- this can be a blessing -- and if youre not paying attention to the words then you cant scrutinize the plot. And the plot of this drastic adaptation of Gaston Lerouxs 1911 novel about a soprano seduced by a murderous genius who lives beneath the Paris Opera simply makes no sense. Certainly not on the philosophical level where any attempt to reduce it to an intelligible conflict -- art vs. life? life vs. death? love vs. anger? -- leads almost instantly to a metaphysical logjam. Fortunately the movie version of Lloyd Webbers smash hit does to the music what the music did to the words and story It distracts the mind and cajoles the eyes to the point that one doesnt really care that everything the ears are hearing is pure nonsense. Its gorgeous nonsense to look at and in director Joel Schumachers hands ""Phantom"" emerges as one of those queer works of art that actually improve somehow as they get tackier and more removed from the original. Gerard Butler as the Phantom and Emmy Rossum as Christine in the attractive but equally nonsensical movie version of Andrew Lloyd Webbers hit musical. (Alex Bailey -- Warner Bros. Pictures) _____More in Movies_____  Phantom Nationwide Showtimes  Watch the Trailer  More Movie Trailers  Holiday Movie Guide  Current Movie Openings  Arts amp; Living Movies Free E-mail Newsletters Washington Entertainment GuideSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now MoviesSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now TravelSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now At HomeSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now Perhaps its because the camera is the ultimate apologist. It apologizes for instance for Patrick Wilson and Emmy Rossum who as the dashing leads cant or wont dance. In a dazzling ballroom scene that marks their betrothal the camera swirls around them supplying the moves that in a real movie musical would be danced by the cast. It apologizes for the fact that when Rossums character the ingenue soprano Christine gets her first big break she doesnt actually produce very good music. But theres the ever-loving camera emphasizing not her singing but the response of others to the music so we love her through them and forgive a voice that would be laughed out of a real opera house. And when Lloyd Webbers score grows particularly repetitive the camera steps discreetly into the void supplying visual momentum when musical momentum falters. So the whole thing feels breathless and exhilarating even if at the end one cant be sure why any of these characters gathered in this place -- an opera house in Paris in the 1870s -- and persisted in the various amours and ambitions that bind them together. When psychological logic fails theres always caricature and when dramatic logic fails theres always cliche. Nobody spins better desserts from caricature and cliche than Lloyd Webber. Caricature thy name is Minnie Driver who acts (but doesnt sing) the role of Carlotta the reigning diva of the Opera Populaire. Driver has made her character not just a shrew (that much is believable of a diva) but a shrew with no surface charisma. To other characters Schumacher has added his own touches turning the nonentity Raoul played by Wilson into a swashbuckling hero on a white horse -- making it yet more inexplicable why Rossums Christine would waver between a dashing young man of fortune and the eponymous Phantom a subterranean homicidal maniac with only half a face. For cliche theres a parade in borrowed rags of material cadged from other dramas and sources. Lloyd Webber adds to the novel the Shakespearean mousetrap device a fateful play within a play a la ""Hamlet""; and in his hands the Phantom morphs from evil genius to suffering artist and becomes a weirdly sympathetic character like the Elephant Man. Operatic references abound in the original score and in the movie Schumacher adds emphasis to the simple family dramas wrenched straight out of ""Freud for Dummies."" In the original musical all of Lloyd Webbers borrowing felt ungenerous. He wasnt playing with and honoring his artistic forebears -- he was stealing with the craven hope that no one would notice. He was making a stew not weaving a fabric and to really enjoy his work you had to put the past out of mind. If you could forget the entire tradition of romantic and Gothic literature then the plot didnt hurt so bad; and if you could pretend that Puccini never existed Lloyd Webbers music sounded pretty darn good. If you can forget the venerable tradition of movie musicals Schumachers latest goes down easy as well. Its an action flick with singing and a three-ring circus of dead plot devices reanimated by movie magic. There are a few admirable performances especially from Simon Callow one of the theater managers who gives sparkle to the musicals best moments of comic-opera pastiche. Wilson and Rossum are at least pretty to look at especially in Alexandra Byrnes sumptuous costumes. Production designer Anthony Pratt has created a stage set -- an actual 886-seat theater inspired by the look of the great Paris opera house the Opera Garnier -- which becomes a world within a world and theres new emphasis on gritty backstage life. Special effects are well used especially in the opening in which the world of Paris transforms from black-and-white storybook illustration to full-color splendor. And if nothing else from the original novel survives into this third generation of reconfiguration the sly sense that the whole thing is a joke on us the gullible audience remains. Leroux dares you to throw the book across the room with a harrumph at his silliness and gall. Lloyd Webbers musical was quite possibly the composers inside joke on opera robbing it blind and insulting it at the same time. In Schumachers movie theres a scene in a graveyard with a swordfight and an open tomb beckoning to the heroine that is so over-the-top with cliches it invites cynics to consider this The director is daring you to notice the artifice the theft the threadbareness of it all by showing you the graveyard as a symbol of popular entertainment that refuses to die. A bad novel that became a bad musical lives on as a gleefully bad movie. The Phantom of the Opera (143 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for brief violent images.

A little Night music Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler hit just the right notes. Warner Bros. Pictures And even audiences who are not familiar with the production -- one of musical theaters biggest successes since its Broadway debut in 1988 -- might be drawn to the slightly more contemporary-sounding and sumptuously staged movie. The look is dazzling befitting the romantic tale of a tortured musical genius who lives in the catacombs of the Paris opera house and takes a promising young singer as his protegee. Scotsman Gerard Butler does a fine job as the charismatic ghostly character who hides away in the opera house because of his disfigurement. Emmy Rossum only 16 when the film was shot seems born to play Christine the trusting ingenue. She has a lovely voice and her scenes with the Phantom in the cavernous nether regions of the opera house are the movies finest moments. His resplendent but sinister lair reached via gondola is wonderfully stylized and seductive. For those whose primary experience with musicals is on the screen this melodramatic tale with the familiar soundtrack should hold substantial appeal. (There is one new song written by Lloyd Webber Learn to be Lonely sung by Minnie Driver during the closing credits.) The film Phantom is more in the overblown extravagant mold of Moulin Rouge than the sophisticated Chicago. And there are some jarringly flat notes. Driver as the diva whom Christine replaces is a ridiculous caricature and ballet mistress Miranda Richardsons over-the-top French accent is off-putting. Christines suitor Raoul played by Patrick Wilson is meant to be swashbuckling but is a bit of a drip. Butlers brooding Phantom is a much more compelling screen presence and the half of his face we do see is manly and handsome. But the shortcomings dont stop the whole lavish affair from being a guilty pleasure. The Phantom offers a couple of hours of escapist and macabre fun.

NOT FOR SALE OR REDISTRIBUTION. Webbers tight reins hobble Phantoms leap to screen 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Andrew Lloyd Webbers The Phantom of the Opera Musical. Starring Gerard Butler Emmy Rossum Patrick Wilson and Minnie Driver. Directed by Joel Schumacher. PG-13. 135 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Visually lush and featuring the familiar tortured love triangle and haunting melodies that have lured 80 million people into theaters around the world ""Andrew Lloyd Webbers The Phantom of the Opera"" appears to contain all the ingredients to explode on the big screen. But the movie misfires as often as it connects and the problem is inherent in its unwieldy title. This version doesnt let us forget who its daddy is. Only occasionally does ""Phantom"" shed its theatrical mask to reveal the irresistible face of an honest-to-goodness movie musical. With Lloyd Webber onboard not just as composer but also co-screenwriter and producer the film seemed destined to stay true to its roots rather than attempt to transcend them. The brilliance of ""Chicago"" lies in its complete and utter transformation from stage to screen. Sir Andrew however might not have stood for anyone -- like say a director -- monkeying around too much with his original concept. Nonetheless Joel Schumacher an old hand with caped eccentrics after directing two ""Batman"" sequels gets off to a promising start in a prelude set during a 1919 auction of the remains of a fabled Paris opera house including bits and pieces of an enormous chandelier. Related Stories Creators shadow haunts Phantom on the big screen The scene is shot in muted black and white like early daguerreotypes. When the action shifts to the venue in its heyday three decades earlier the images slowly bleed into resplendent Technicolor. The screen fills up with posturing opera singers in full plumage led by the diva Carlotta (Minnie Driver channeling Maria Callas) who acts as if the entire opera staff is conspiring against her. At this point the movie is a talkie not an operetta as it was onstage. Carlotta has words with the stagehands instead of serenading them. But ""Phantom"" abruptly changes its tune with the introduction of Christine (Emmy Rossum) and her competing lovers -- opera patron Vicompte Raoul de Chagny (Patrick Wilson) and a masked misfit (Gerard Butler) who writes brilliant operas for Christine from the theaters catacombs where hes holed up hiding a maimed face. Unlike his rival with the trail of names he goes simply by the Phantom (you would too if you got an entire show named for you). Christine cant look at either suitor without feeling a song coming on. Evidently they feel the same. ""Angel of Music"" her sexually charged duet with the Phantom and ""All I Ask of You"" her more innocent one with Raoul are showstoppers. But its not necessarily a good thing to stop a movie. It makes audiences think such things as ""Why did these two people suddenly burst into song?"" ""The Phantom"" would have been better served by weaving the songs into the plot as ""Chicago"" did instead of asking the cast to sing a little talk a little then sing some more as if performing a variety show. Driver who has a romp screeching and distorting her face is the films biggest name and she gives the biggest performance. The principal roles have been left to relative unknowns who lack the stupendous talent to make you forget theyre not stars. Of the love triangle Rossum fares the best. Her angelic voice makes it crystal clear why Christine is the Phantoms soprano of choice. The actress has enormous eyes which she uses to express Christines emotions as two men attempt to consume her. Butler gives the Phantom everything hes got belting out his solos with terrifying conviction. The trouble is he doesnt seem particularly terrifying in any other way and hes awfully good-looking for the role. When Christine rips off his mask you expect to see the English patient. Instead you get a hunk with a drooping eye. Wilson is the weakest link. His Raoul is a milquetoast -- he would never get the girl if his competition werent a madman. The money saved on big-name actors went into elaborate period costumes and breathtaking sets. Schumacher who started as an art director has an unfailing eye for color and detail. Christines dressing room is flooded with peach-color flowers. Later a single red rose is brought to a cemetery providing a splash of color in another black-and-white scene. Through fancy camerawork the opera house appears to be on as many levels as a skyscraper. Deep down is the Phantoms lair to which he brings Christine in a gondola surrounded by so much water it could be Venice or at least the Venetian. Meanwhile at ceiling level a chandelier hangs precariously. Theres a certain relief watching ""The Phantom"" in a movie house and not having the urge to duck. -- Advisory This movie has brief moments of violence.

"A fright at the Opera? - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW A fright at the Opera? A wooden Phantom provides neither genius nor madness just irritation By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  December 22 2004 Today The Phantom of the Opera"" lurches from Broadway to the megaplex and it has a little something to irritate everybody. People looking for romance will find only cardboard lovers. People looking for a resounding musical will find it odd that the camera runs away from the lip-synching cast. And people looking for opera -- well shame on you.There is however in this shameless atrocity a phantom (Gerard Butler) and he does haunt a big 19th-century Paris opera house with his face half-obscured by a white mask. With the aid of the dance instructor Madame Giry (Miranda Richardson) hes been giving secret lessons to Christine Daa (Emmy Rossum) the orphaned vestal ingenue in the chorus of the Opera Populaire. For some time the besotted Phantom has been trying to terrorize the new owners into making Christine the star.After the Phantom drives out the companys Italian diva La Carlotta (Minnie Driver) the plaudits and the massive dressing room are Christines. And just in time for her debut her childhood love appears a young arts patron called the Vicomte Raoul de Chagny (Patrick Wilson). The flame he wants to rekindle comes at a price for Christine -- the possessive Phantom wants her too and if Raoul doesnt watch out the Phantom will force his pupil into being his bride and demolish the opera house.As a preview the Phantom lures her away to his Batcave down in the theaters dank bowels. To get there the camera plows though floorboards and stage doors the same way that CSI"" zooms through intestines. This lair is where he keeps the big seashell that doubles as a daybed and the organ on which he bangs out a steroidal Vincent Price-worthy riff best described as schlock n roll. He seduces Christine with the shows signature song The Music of the Night"" and a ride in his gondola. Shes bewildered by images of herself clad in a wedding dress. The freaked-out cast and crew dub this man a ghost. Christine just calls him her angel of music"" which is true in much the same way that Howard Stern is the king of all media.The credits for The Phantom of the Opera"" insist that Andrew Lloyd Webber authored these tunes. But they come crashing through the speakers with such punishing force that it wouldnt be wrong to think Jerry Bruckheimer might have written them. Music in this production comes at you like the killer in a horror film. There are people out there for whom The Phantom of the Opera"" can never be too loud too deadly too gaudy or too obese with bloated songs. But even they might have a little trouble with the fact that in director Joel Schumachers hands the entire production often looks and feels like a Halloween halftime show. That moment will probably come during the big masquerade ball where certain folks in the audience will turn to one another and ask about the actors dancing on-screen Are they vogueing?"" For one thing the shot selection is dubious. The camera will often look at anything other than whos singing (everyone except Driver does his or her own singing) and the editor seems to have it in for poor Rossum who was previously seen nearly freezing to death in The Day After Tomorrow"" and as Sean Penns doomed daughter in Mystic River."" Her trained singing voice flies like a songbird but she often looks enchanted yet lifeless like the pristine charm spinning in a music box. The films preferred mode of musical choreography seems to be having the singer sing while on the march or on the run which explains why the musical performances are so underwhelming.Schumacher wrote the script with Lloyd Webber and maybe they were both having Titanic"" thoughts. Maybe they thought the famed climactic plummeting of the chandelier would conjure the same shivers of devastation as when James Camerons ocean liner met that iceberg. (It doesnt.) The Phantom of the Opera"" isnt enjoyable as a love story and its not especially moving as a tragedy. It should be noted that Lloyd Webber in his stage adaptation took the gothic parody out of Gaston Lerouxs 1911 book and whipped it into a straight-faced soap opera.Schumachers film is at times unintentionally entertaining as its tone shifts from ridiculous to overwrought. There are moments when the movie seems desperate to approach the lyric surrealism of Emeric Pressburger and Michael Powells The Red Shoes"" and Jean Cocteaus Beauty and the Beast"" the foulness of Dario Argentos own Faustian Phantom"" adaptation or at least the insanity of Brian De Palmas The Phantom of the Paradise."" But Schumachers movie is never sexy or delirious enough. At one point Raoul says about the Phantom Clearly Madame Giry genius has turned to madness"" The movie shows flashes of neither.Whats missing from Phantom"" is the fearlessness of certain movie stars to transcend the clunkiness a Hugh Jackman a Johnny Depp or a Kirsten Dunst. Butler Wilson and Rossum dont have the charisma to stop this thing from steamrolling over them but theyd make wonderful displays in a wax museum. Dishwater has more razzle-dazzle.Richardson has fun playing with her fake ponytail and phonier French accent. But Driver with her tantrums and flailing steals the movie. Its the years pettiest theft and shes still terrible -- the kind of star that tops only Christmas trees. But unlike everyone else involved with this production she at least knows how to make tinsel shine. Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

"Phantom of the Opera The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; phantom-of-the-opera-the ) Phantom of the Opera The (United States/United Kingdom 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli I have never been a fan of Andrew Lloyd Webbers phenomenally popular stage musical version of The Phantom of the Opera so it will probably come as no surprise that the film adaptation which is faithful to its inspiration left me feeling underwhelmed. Truth be told I am not fond of Lloyd Webbers style of music and The Phantom of the Opera suffers from a multitude of problems not the least of which are poor writing and an uneasy marriage between a gothic setting and big-production musical numbers. The tale of the Phantom is softened considerably in an attempt to keep things from becoming too depressing. This film underwent a lot of iterations before finally making it to the screen. As originally conceived in 1990 it was to star Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman (the original Broadway performers) but those two long since departed along with many other names including Antonio Banderas. The trio who eventually got the lead roles are relative unknowns Gerard Butler is the Phantom (his largest previous role was as ""the Stranger"" in Dear Frankie); Emmy Rossum (the dead daughter in Mystic River) is Christine; and Patrick Wilson is Raoul. Its hard to make any determination about their acting skills based on this movie but they can all sing to one degree or another. The supporting roles are filled by British character actors - Miranda Richardson as Madame Giry Minnie Driver as the diva Carolotta and Ciran Hinds and Simon Callow as Firmin and Andre the new owners of the Opera House. Although the storyline has been made more coherent for the movie than it is in the stage version it nevertheless helps to have seen a previous version of the film or to have read the novel upon which it is based. In brief Christine is an up-and-coming opera star who has taken extensive voice lessons from the mysterious Phantom who lurks in caves beneath the Opera House. The Phantom loves Christine but will not allow her to see his scarred face for fear that she will reject him. His goal is to make her a star but when he achieves that he loses her to Raoul her childhood sweetheart who is now the Opera Houses patron. But once he realizes Christine has slipped away the Phantoms jealousy has terrible consequences. I wont say this is the worst version on the roughly half-dozen cinematic editions of the story to-date but its near the bottom and doesnt come close to either the silent classic with Lon Chaney or the 1943 re-make with Claude Rains. Of course its goals are different. When he penned the musical Lloyd Webber was not striving for shock and horror. Instead he wanted to emphasize the romance and operatic elements. Hes successful when it comes to the latter - theres a lot of singing even to the point where whole passages of dialogue are sung rather than recited. The love story is a failure however. While some emotion is evident between Christine and the Phantom Raoul is as boring a hero as has ever graced the screen. Added to that Butler has screen presence - a quality that Wilson lacks. Its impossible to believe that Christine feels anything for Raoul (or vice versa) and The Phantom of the Operas insistence upon fostering this dead-end love affair is its downfall. The director is Joel Schumacher who despite commercial successes like Batman Forever Falling Down and Phone Booth would seem an unlikely choice for a gothic musical melodrama. Theres nothing special about Schumachers approach; he presents the material in a mostly straightforward manner. He offers one tremendous visual image when the chandelier is raised and the Opera House returns to its splendor of 1870 (the movie is bookended with unnecessary scenes in the 1910s). Beyond that Schumacher does little more than highlight the singers dancers costumes and set design. One could argue that for a movie like that his approach is the correct one. Its questionable whether fans of the musical will be enamored with this adaptation. The energy that characterizes a live performance is absent resulting in a production that often feels sluggish and slow-moving. And the absence of a cast associated with the stage version may aggravate any who feel their favorites have been slighted. Those who have not seen the stage version are unlikely to be won over by this Schumacher/Lloyd Webber collaboration. Its the kind of motion picture that typifies why movie musicals are rarely made - were it not for the huge built-in audience its hard to imagine many patrons paying to see this. Ultimately however appreciation of The Phantom of the Opera will hinge upon your opinion of Lloyd Webbers skills as a composer. The film like the stage show contains one great baroque theme and a lot of unmemorable drivel. If you are partial to Lloyd Webbers style you will at least find The Phantom of the Opera palatable. If not then this will be an endurance contest. This isnt really a film that needs reviewing. Going in most viewers will know what to expect and Schumachers unchallenging style delivers without frills. For some this will be a new way to enjoy a favorite musical. But for those like me its a mostly tedious way to kill 140 minutes.

Eighteen years after his London bow ""The Phantom of the Opera"" lives to sing again. Sumptuous pic version which evokes the original show while working as a movie in its own right is lit by a radiant vocally lustrous perf by teenaged Emmy Rossum as the Phantoms muse and has a widescreen sweep and musical fluidity that avoids enervating ""Moulin Rouge""-like flashiness. Given the shows enduring fan base international business looks to be in a major key. However unlike ""Chicago"" pic lacks the stars and Broadway pizzazz needed to attract a significant new audience especially among young males. Rapid worldwide rollout starts Dec. 10 in the U.K. continuing through January. Film reaches U.S. shores Dec. 22 with moderate opening and goes wide Jan. 21. The combo of a technically experienced film director (Joel Schumacher) with little background in theater and a legit producer-composer (Andrew Lloyd Webber) with little experience in cinema works remarkably well. Both seem to have faith in the basic material and nothing to prove beyond it The musics the thing here and apart from a few structural tweaks and richer settings for the action neither director nor producer mess with success. As the umpteenth adaptation of Gaston Lerouxs baroque novel Lloyd Webbers musical was notable for discarding most of its horror-movie legacy (from Lon Chaneys classic 1925 silent to Dario Argentos 1998 gorefest) and turning the ""Beauty and the Beast"" theme into an operatic meller grounded in its legit setting. (Only other pic version in such a yearningly romantic vein is Ronny Yus luscious Sino ""The Phantom Lover"" starring the late Leslie Cheung and catchily scored by Chris Babida.) Schumacher further softens the horror aspects not only in the Phantoms mask (now hardly larger than an eye-patch) and scarred face (now little more than a bad acne attack) but also in the darkness of his soul. Although thesp Gerard Butler has a considerably deeper more resonant voice than Phantom stage originator Michael Crawford its rarely matched by an appropriately stygian atmosphere. More Gotham City-like darkness would have helped punch up the screen presence of this 19th-century Gallic Batman. Opening reels stick closely to the show as in 1919 an auctioneer (Paul Brooke) sells off knickknacks in the crumbling dusty auditorium of Paris Opera Populaire and the aged Raoul Vicomte de Chagny (Patrick Wilson convincingly aged) buys a music box with special memories. Thunderous organ chords then announce the overture as yarn flashbacks to 1870 the building morphing into color and its former glory in a scalp-tingling f/x sequence. As the company rehearses Chalumeaus cheesy opera ""Hannibal"" pic communicates a real delight in the mechanics and community of live theater from backstage gizmos to costuming and contumely. With two experienced thesps Simon Callow and Ciaran Hinds playing the houses new owners veteran Murray Melvin as the campy conductor and a beefed-up role for the comically temperamental diva La Carlotta (Minnie Driver) the film nourishes this extra dimension throughout which benefits the patter songs and later ensemble numbers like ""Masquerade."" After the Phantom makes his presence felt with a falling backdrop that just misses Carlotta the diva storms off and chorus girl Christine (Rossum) is given a shot at her part. Pic dazzlingly segues from her audition to her actual performance (""Think of Me"") while seated in a box young aristocratic patron Raoul recognizes her as his childhood sweetheart. Christine tells her best friend Meg (Jennifer Ellison) daughter of ballet mistress Mme. Giry (Miranda Richardson) that she believes shes been visited by the Angel of Music. As first Raoul visits her in her dressing room and then the Phantom appears and seduces her (""The Music of the Night"") the storys various poles are set up -- love vs. sexual passion high society vs. the outsider celebrity vs. art -- in Christines relationships with the two men. This first 40 minutes forms a breathless first act that adds texture and depth to the stage show in a cinematic way (such as Christine and Megs duet ""Angel of Music"" set in a small chapel with soft refracted colors from a window). After settling the audience down Schumacher and Lloyd Webber start to tweak the original basically converting a two-act musical into a standard three-act movie. Most notable changes are moving the crashing chandelier that famously closed Act I to the very end -- more logical in movie terms -- and backgrounding the main characters in brief flashbacks. Much less of an improvement is periodically returning to the ""present"" in a mini-story centered on the aged Raoul. These short sequences rendered in grainy newsreel-like monochrome disrupt the main storys flow and its accumulated romantic atmosphere especially at the end. Deleting them would trim the running time which starts to feel a tad long around the two-hour mark. Casting of the supports led by a delightfully over-the-top Driver is acute down to the smallest roles. Callow in full theatrical-luvvy mode seems born for his part with the more staid Hinds just managing to keep pace with him in the patter numbers. Lower key than usual Richardson is solid as the all-knowing Mme. Giry. Casting of the three leads is more uneven. Aside from his rooftop duet with Rossum (""All I Ask of You"") Wilson strikes few sparks as Raoul and his flat Yank accent doesnt chime well with the largely Brit cast. Butler Angelina Jolies partner in the second ""Lara Croft"" has considerably more physical presence than Wilson. But he seems over-constrained until the final reels when the powerfully evocative number ""The Point of No Return"" finally strides into the score. Though her impact is slightly diluted by the two leading mens weaknesses Rossum who played the murdered teen in Clint Eastwoods ""Mystic River"" still shines as Christine. American thesp who turned 17 during filming and trained as a youngster at New Yorks Met sports a limpidly arresting voice and looks that recalls a younger version of the roles originator Sarah Brightman. All of the pics independently raised PS50 million (now 96 million) budget -- WB simply took North American distribution in exchange for pic rights reverting to Lloyd Webber -- is up on the screen. Anthony Pratts meticulously detailed sets (spread across eight sound stages at the U.K.s Pinewood Studios) evoke real settings in a slightly heightened style complemented by Alexandra Byrnes costumes in pastels blacks and whites. D.p. John Mathiesons play with diffused light often recalls his interiors in ""Gladiator"" though here his color palette is wider. Orchestrations by the original shows David Cullen are full-bodied without drowning the lyrics in a wall of sound; more importantly they dont have to fight the effects track for attention. Sole glitch on the tech side is some sloppy lip-synch in the songs notably in the Phantoms first number. All players except Driver sang their own songs. In what is thought to be a first the vocals were recorded at Pinewood as rehearsals and filming progressed (thereby incorporating improvements in performance) rather than being pre-recorded.
