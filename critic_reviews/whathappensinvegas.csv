This toxic admixture of computer-generated frenzy and live-action torpor succeeds in being almost simultaneously genuinely painful -- the esthetic equivalent of needles in eyeballs -- and weirdly benumbing like eye candy laced with lidocaine. ""The Matrix"" gave us the trippy pleasure of bullet time a super-slo-mo vision of the world. ""Speed Racer"" gives us the paradox of a drive time thats super-fast and all but interminable. If its target audience turns out in vast numbers well be looking at child endangerment on a global scale. The story derives from the popular Japanese animated series that first came to American TV in the late 1960s. Fast cars obsess the Racer family Speed a brilliant young driver played by Emile Hirsch; his parents Mom and Pops Racer (Susan Sarandon and John Goodman); and Speeds kid brother Spritle whos played by Paulie Litt. (Chim Chim the familys pet chimp is mainly concerned with reaction shots.) The concept of camp seems to have obsessed the Wachowski brothers. Its what Larry and Andy were shooting for in the live-action sequences but what they got is laborious comedy loads of exposition and elephantine drama interspersed with tedious lectures on Matrix-related themes -- nothing is what it seems corporations are running the world and everything is crooked. ""Thats what racing is about"" says Roger Allams Royalton the evil industrialist who runs Royalton Industries. ""It has nothing to do with cars. Its all about power and the unassailable might of money."" ENLARGE When Speed discovers the terrible truth he tells Pops ""Theyve known the winner of every Grand Prix for the last 50 years."" One of the movies many dramatic problems is that Speed makes his discovery by the end of the first hour -- ""The Matrixs"" Neo took much longer to see the light -- so there are few surprises in the events that unfold during the next 69 or so minutes. But events dont really unfold in this film; that would imply development or coherence. They burst forth to the accompaniment of keening engines and triumphalist music. (Michael Giacchinos score favors big drums blaring trombones and wailing choirs.) The storytelling is incoherent even within the animated races each of which starts at breakbrain speed and sustains it until a new plot pothole slows things down. ""Speed Racer"" is a nightmare vision of childrens entertainment. Its overstimulation as an organizing principle -- colors that call for a riot squad (who knew that pastels could be assaultive?); pacing that approaches the precipice of looniness; a moral tale -- Speeds virtue versus the racing worlds vice -- told in stentorian tones better suited to propaganda. The visual style descended from anime seeks to up the videogame ante but the movie misreads that medium too. Gamers enjoy a sense of control whether real or illusory. Audiences here must sit in passive stupefaction. ""I go to the races to watch you make art"" Speeds mother tells him ""and its beautiful inspiring everything art should be."" She lies. Its exactly what art isnt. Its chaos. What Happens in Vegas... ""What Happens in Vegas..."" should have stayed in development -- forever. This ramshackle -- and occasionally repulsive -- farce doesnt even deliver on the minimal promise of its title; most of it takes place in Manhattan. Cameron Diaz is Joy a commodities trader who gets dumped by her fiance. Ashton Kutcher is Jack a party animal with a rich father who deplores his hedonism. You know the movies in trouble from the first of its countless glib exchanges ""Youre like a son to me."" ""Dad I am your son."" You cant know unless you stick it out -- I did because I had to -- how joyless this comedy can be. Suffice it to say that when Joy and Jack meet in Las Vegas where theyve gone to lick their respective wounds they get drunk married and rich in swift succession then spend most of the movie bickering since theyre a standard-brand mismatched couple. Its hard to say what Jacks emotional age was meant to be -- Mr. Kutcher plays him like a petulant pre-schooler -- but all too clear that Ms. Diaz a gifted comedienne should not have set foot on this set. Tom Vaughan directed from Dana Foxs script which stops at nothing. IN BRIEF ""OSS 117 Cairo Nest of Spies"" has its moments -- more than can be said for either of the films discussed above. A French-language spoof of the James Bond genre its set in the 1950s and stars Jean Dujardin a popular French comedian who looks a bit like Steve Coogan. ""OSS 117"" makes you appreciate the Road movies of Bob Hope and Bing Crosby; Mr. Dujardin could have used sharper material and livelier foils. Still his secret agent Hubert Bonisseur de la Bath is invincibly smug occasionally smarmy and obsessed with food. If that whets your appetite hes your homme. Morgensterns DVD Tip ENLARGE Tom Vaughans previous film ""Starter for 10"" a 2006 debut feature made in England was as graceful and light as ""What Happens in Vegas..."" is grating and leaden. James McAvoy stars as Brian Jackson a working-class nerd who joins Bristol Universitys academic team on TV.

What Happens in Vegas has a variation of a joke featured in Baby Mama as well as a slew of stale riffs on gags and scenarios from a number of comedies mostly of the romantic variety. Its a story that feels familiar at best hackneyed at worst which is surprising and disappointing as director Tom Vaughan also made last years Starter for 10 a charming British coming-of-age comedy. CLIP Find out what does happen in Vegas CALENDAR When are summers hottest flicks in theaters? There are some funny scenes that bring to mind 1989s War of the Roses. But more often this feels like a by-the-book romantic comedy especially by the time it reaches its predictable conclusion. Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz star as a mismatched couple who meet cute in Las Vegas get rip-roaringly drunk and tie the knot. Though the two are appealing enough the ditzy Diaz is miscast as an uptight commodities trader. Their respective best friends Rob Corddry and Lake Bell are responsible for most of the bigger laughs. The Vegas segment involves variations on the theme of humiliating debauchery. Kutcher and Diaz are consigned to the same room booze is guzzled inhibitions disappear and they wake up married. Sobered up the next morning they cant stand the sight of each other. Beyond devising outlandish ways to bicker and fight theres not much that can be done with this premise. So the ante is upped when Kutcher tosses Diazs quarter into a slot machine and hits the jackpot. Each party insists the 3 million is theirs and turns to a court to adjudicate the winnings. Judge Whopper (Dennis Miller) sentences the couple to ""six months of hard marriage."" He orders the two to see a marriage counselor (Queen Latifah) and some of the pairs funnier moments together are on her couch. The humor in the squabbling of unhappily married people has been mined to death in movies and on TV. And the indignities of heavy drinking havent lacked for depiction. So theres really nothing new here except for the specific actors doing the coupling and imbibing. And theyre perfect for each other. But the rule of romantic comedies requires that couples meet have a falling out break up miss each other and end up together. And What Happens in Vegas refuses to take a gamble. Like a bleary-eyed gambler repeatedly tossing a pair of dice it tiredly goes through the motions. Audiences are left with a mediocre movie that takes no chances and relies on the luck of previous players.

"What Happens in Vegas A safe bet | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsWhat Happens in Vegas A safe bet Heres a romantic comedy that is goofy highly implausible sometimes over the top often in bad taste and resolutely empty-headed. In short its the best example of its genre to appear on the screen this year.Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz star in What Happens in Vegas.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Philip MarchandMoviesFri. May 9 2008 What Happens in Vegas (out of 4)Starring Cameron Diaz Ashton Kutcher Rob Corddry Treat Williams Dennis Farina Queen Latifah Dennis Miller. Directed by Tom Vaughan. 99 minutes. At major theatres. PG Heres a romantic comedy that is goofy highly implausible sometimes over the top often in bad taste and resolutely empty-headed. In short its the best example of its genre to appear on the screen this year.Even the premise of the movie sounds like the flimsiest of contrivances. Joy McNally (Cameron Diaz) is a Wall Street trader on the rebound after being dumped by her boyfriend; Jack Fuller (Ashton Kutcher) is recovering from the trauma of being fired from his job as a clerk in a building supplies store. To soothe their respective hurt feelings they go to Las Vegas accidentally meet and take a dislike to each other. This dislike morphs according to the logic of Hollywood romantic comedies into a night of wild debauchery culminating in their getting married in a Las Vegas chapel while bombed out of their minds.Remorse dismay and despair are words too feeble to describe their feelings on the morning after. Clearly the marriage must be ended.Theres a small complication however - contemptuously handed a quarter by Joy Jack contemptuously puts it into a slot machine. Result a 3 million jackpot.Legal manoeuvrings ensure adjudicated by Judge Whopper (Dennis Miller). Details neednt detain us except to note that the judges ruling ensures that the two main characters remain in close enough proximity to allow both for an ongoing battle and for the possibility of sneaking affection between the two. Even the most knock em down drag em out romantic comedy has to allow for a shot of moral and emotional seriousness. Fortunately What Happens in Vegas keeps this to a minimum.Jack it turns out has a problem with self-esteem aggravated by his hypercritical father Jack Fuller Sr. (Treat Williams.) Joy also has personal ""issues."" Kutchers performance as Jack it turns out keeps this precarious ship afloat along with two other male characters. Joys boss Banger (Dennis Farina) with his battered thuggish face and menacing voice always compels attention especially conveying the tiniest hint of humanity. Jacks shyster lawyer buddy Hater (Rob Corddry an alumnus of Jon Stewarts The Daily Show) shows himself to be a beady-eyed comic actor with a limitless potential of playing self-infatuated weasels.""Dude youre letting this chick into your head"" he advises Jack. ""You should never let a chick into your head. Thats why I dont talk to my dates."" Kutcher manages to make his character convincingly engagingly dopey. Much has to be forgiven him in the course of the movie and his characters future - if we allow ourselves to think about such a thing - is very shaky.But his main job is to be likeable occasionally charming and not offensive. Thats all that is expected of him and thats what he does deliver.

Uh Id like to politely decline. Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME ""Dying is easy comedy is hard."" Its probably the stalest cliche in show business so much so that one thinks maybe its ripe for re-examination. Lets stipulate that great comedy -- like great anything -- is difficult. But it seems to me that creating OK comedy the sort of thing that allows you to pass an idle Saturday night pleasantly if not memorably is not necessarily a life-threatening activity. I mean what do you need? A couple of attractive actors a goofy but not entirely implausible premise a modicum of snappy dialogue the navigation of a handful of embarrassing situations before the couple finally realizes that all kidding aside they were meant for each other. You dont have to be Oscar Wilde or for that matter Neil Simon to pull that off. Why then do we have to suffer through movies like What Happens in Vegas which is the worst-in-breed not only for this year but very likely in living memory. The tormented pair Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher are not at all dislikable and their situation is not comedically hopeless. They meet in the eponymous city he having lost his job she having lost her fiance. Both are trying to forget these blows. But they get drunk get married on a whim -- and accidentally win three million dollars on a single turn at a slot machine. This inconveniences settlement of the divorce proceedings that shortly ensue for a cranky judge (Dennis Miller) sentences them to six months ""hard marriage"" -- complete with couples therapy presided over by Queen Latifah -- to see if they can work things out. It is at this point that the movie heads south into predictable stupidity. She of course is an up-tight neat freak. Hes an amiable slob. Shes a careerist. He doesnt much care if he ever works again. She moves into his bachelor pad which I dont really have to describe since youve been there a dozen times -- dirty dishes and empty beer bottles everywhere the floors strewn with socks and underwear -- and dont even think about the bathroom. She has a long scene where she tries to teach him the virtues of putting the toilet seat up before using the facility. She on the other hand sometimes lengthily preempts the bathroom which obliges him to use that kitchen sink to relieve himself. Thats the height of the hilarity on offer here and its not hard to see where the writer Dana Fox and the director Tom Vaughan went wrong. Whatever audience for high (or even medium) wit once existed has mostly decamped for Assisted Living. There remains a small slightly doddering crowd thats up for small well-written comedies like Helen Hunts Then She Found Me which is currently playing in a release that will remain forever limited to older people who are not afraid to visit the ""art"" houses Mass market comedy (unless Judd Apatow and his heart-healthy pals are involved) is pitched largely to a young crowd that apparently likes to see pretty people -- especially upwardly striving ones like Diazs character -- humiliated and abused in ways that are stupefyingly familiar. Im beginning to think that these kids represent a resentment demographic less eager to laugh than they are to exercise spite and envy at peers who want to grow up sensibly rather than throw up mindlessly in some sleazebag movie.

(AP Photo/20th Century Fox K.C. Bailey)  ... more Photo K.C. Bailey Movie review What happens in Vegas? Not much. 1 / 1 Back to Gallery What Happens in Vegas Comedy. Starring Cameron Diaz Ashton Kutcher and Rob Corddry. Directed by Tom Vaughan. (PG-13. 99 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. To see complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) Considering that the title of the movie was conceived by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority its not a huge surprise that ""What Happens in Vegas"" is stocked with product placement. But that investment is all but wasted in the first big comedy of the summer movie season. Who wants to spend a minute on the Strip with the chance that there might be people as annoying as the characters played by Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher walking around? Playing two strangers who cant stand each other at first but hook up anyway Diaz and Kutcher arent exactly Bogart and Hepburn. They arent even Cook and Alba. Although much of the movies problems can be blamed on the screenplay the pair has no chemistry and not enough talent to create improvisational laughs out of the material. So they take what little humor theyre given in the script and compensate by delivering their lines with too much emphasis and overselling the pratfalls. Mr. Bill was a more subtle actor. Kutcher is Jack a guy who isnt exactly serious boyfriend material and cant handle the pressure of a serious relationship. You know this because characters are constantly telling him stuff like ""Youre not exactly boyfriend material"" and ""You cant handle the pressure."" Throughout ""What Happens in Vegas"" the filmmakers assume everyone in the audience has both attention deficit disorder and dementia. Jack meets Joy (Diaz) who is basically a blond version of the Monica character on ""Friends."" This becomes confusing because the first act of the movie also borrows heavily from the events of Ross and Rachels drunken Vegas wedding in the same program. After Jack wins a jackpot with Joys quarter a judge (Dennis Miller who will no doubt make fun of himself for taking this role in his next HBO stand-up special) refuses to allow them to annul their quickie nuptials and split the money until they spend six months living together in Jacks nasty Petri dish of a bachelor pad. From there the movie enters ""War of the Roses"" territory with the pair giving each other drug overdoses falsely accusing each other of felonies and committing one act of assault and battery approximately every three minutes of screen time. All of the above would be fine - who doesnt want to see Kutcher pelted in the testicles with oranges? - except were expected to believe that this couple really might be meant for each other. A bit of relief arrives whenever Rob Corddry and Lake Bell are onscreen playing Jack and Joys supportive and dark-humored best friends. In the right hands lines like ""If I could make someone dead with my mind it would be you"" and ""There ought to be a law against how bad of a lawyer I am - but I wouldnt know about it"" are actually quite funny. ""What Happens in Vegas"" is like ""When Harry Met Sally"" with every good part taken out except for Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby. But whenever the laughter fades inevitably a horrible line is uttered by one of the other characters ruining any goodwill that came before it. Most of this dialogue involves some sort of clumsy Vegas metaphor ""If you stop betting you never have to lose"" ... ""You bet on me and you made me want to bet on myself."" ... ""If you dont mind my saying I can see youre out of aces. For a taste of your whiskey Ill give you some advice."" (OK the last one was Kenny Rogers. You can tell because its written considerably better than anything in ""What Happens in Vegas."") Speaking of gambling the first 20 minutes of this film qualifies as an infomercial for Sin City. Imagine a Las Vegas where penthouse suites are comped in pairs 3 million slot machine jackpots are just a quarter away and no matter where youre standing the Bellagio fountains are climaxing in the background. But in the end Budweiser gets even more of its moneys worth in ""What Happens in Vegas."" The main characters seem to consume the beverage in such enormous quantities its a wonder anyone can complete a sentence. Unfortunately most of the time they manage just fine. -- Advisory You never count your money when youre sitting at the table.

What Happens in Vegas (PG-13) Fox (99 min.) Directed by Tom Vaughan. With Cameron Diaz Ashton Kutcher. Now playing in New Jersey. ONE AND A HALF STARS Joys just been dumped. Jacks just been fired. So when their respective best friends tell them now is the time for a blow-out in Vegas they agree. And when they accidentally meet there they decide to go the limit gambling their heads off downing endless bottles of Moet and finally impulsively marrying each other. Which suddenly the next hungover morning doesnt seem like such a great idea. Making things difficult is that theyve won 3 million on the slots -- which neither is willing to give up or even very eager to split. Making things impossible is the divorce-court judge they see back in New York who rather than giving them their quick annulment orders them to live together and try to make it work. Let the nasty games begin. Its called ""What Happens in Vegas"" but it should have been called ""What Happens in Hollywood"" as it pretty much defines contrived studio comedy. Theres nothing remotely real about the movie from Cameron Diazs uptight Wall Street trader to Ashton Kutchers 30-going-on-3 frat boy. Even in the wacky world of screwball farce the idea of Dennis Millers judge sentencing them to ""six months of hard marriage"" is merely absurd. The only good joke in the whole thing is that author Dana Fox who also wrote ""The Wedding Date"" and rewrote ""27 Dresses"" has been named one of Varietys Top Ten Screenwriters to Watch. Make that Watch Out For. (Sample comic dialogue ""Do you think I went overboard?"" ""No I think its just the right amount of board."") Diaz does her patented wide-grinned adorable ditz act but it doesnt fit her buttoned-down character (but then neither does that description necessarily fit an adrenaline-pumped trader). Kutcher does his hunky dude shtick and tries painfully hard to find the humor. As his best friend an angry lawyer nicknamed ""Hater"" Rob Corddry is as usual insufferable. (Hes picked up Larry Millers comic mantle as Least Welcome Supporting Player.) The one small bright spot in the cast is Lake Bell who plays Diazs bitter friend Tipper. Bell is all sharp profile and hard elbows and she gives the movie the kind of strangely sexy hostility Catherine Keener used to specialize in. It may only be the typical smart-and-bitchy best friend part but Bell perks thing up whenever she appears. Considering she already survived ""Over her Dead Body"" I suspect shell be around for awhile. The movie though as engineered by British director Tom Vaughan just goes from mild set-up to even milder payoff. For once this is a comedy that probably could have used a little more raunch. (A PG-13 movie about Vegas? Really?) The only surprise in the entire enterprise is that the ending manages to include two cliches -- the current lets-all-go-to-court device and the time-honored let-me-run-after-you-now-that-I-know-how-much-you-mean-to-me scene. All the climax is missing is the applauding crowd of strangers. Its not likely to find them in the theater. Rating note The film contains alcohol abuse sexual situations comic violence and strong language. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

That and the fact that theyre gorgeous physical specimens (something the movie takes great pains to showcase) and basically likable screen personalities may well be enough to satisfy legions of audience members not to mention the bookkeepers at our sister company 20th Century Fox. The bad news is that director Tom Vaughan (""Starter for 10"") goes out of his way to encourage the stars tendency to mug. Laughs are few and far between in the innuendo-laden script attributed to Dana Fox whos also responsible for the reprehensible ""The Wedding Date."" For an idea of the level of wit several gags are built around the name Dick Banger which belongs to Diazs boss. Hes played by Dennis Farina and his main function is to give an unprintable nickname to Kutchers character. Diaz portrays the ironically named Joy an uptight Manhattan stockbroker who has fled to Las Vegas after being dumped by her fiance in front of all her friends at his surprise birthday party. There she meets Jack (Kutcher) a womanizing man-boy of a cabinet builder whos just been fired by his boss (Treat Williams) who also happens to be Jacks fed-up father. Hate at first sight turns into alcohol-fueled lust and a quickie Vegas wedding which Jacks lawyer pal Steve (Rob Corddry) promises to have annulled over breakfast the next morning. Unfortunately theres a 3 million slot-machine jackpot involved and the extremely contrived plot requires Judge Whopper (Dennis Miller) to sentence the newly married couple to ""six months hard marriage"" while he and a counselor (Queen Latifah) try to sort things out. Egged on by Steve and Joys BFF (Lake Bell) the couple newly cohabitating under the Brooklyn Bridge try to drive each other crazy and into the arms of others. This involves recruiting ""sluts"" removing toilet seats and trying other tired gambits that are telegraphed well in advance and dragged out far past the point of diminishing returns. Screenwriter Fox claims ""What Happens in Vegas"" was inspired by Britney Spears first marriage but Id find it hard to believe she hasnt seen ""Laws of Attraction"" a terrible Pierce Brosnan-Julianne Moore romantic comedy set mostly in Ireland with a virtually identical plot. Didnt work then either. WHAT HAPPENS IN VEGAS Shoulda stayed there. Running time 99 minutes. Rated PG-13 (vulgar sex humor profanity drugs).

Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday May 8 2008 631 PM What Happens in Vegas. Romantic comedy about mismatched newlyweds forced to stay together. With Cameron Diaz Ashton Kutcher. Director Tom Vaughan (139). PG-13 sexuality language alcohol. At area theaters. If you happen to think beer commercials are hilarious youll love ""What Happens in Vegas"" which exists in a universe in which all women are gorgeous and uptight and all men are irresponsible slobs. Mars meets Venus on the Vegas strip when Ashton Kutchers Jack bumps into Cameron Diazs Joy. Jack has just been fired from the family business while Joy was recently dumped by her demanding fiance (Jason Sudeikis). Both need to drown their sorrows and after a liquor-soaked night they spontaneously get married. They wake up the next morning realize they have absolutely nothing in common and immediately agree to go their separate ways. But when Jack wins a 3 million jackpot with Joys quarter a quickie divorce is no longer an option. Annoyed by their irresponsibility a cranky judge (Dennis Miller) insists they live together for six months and visit a counselor (Queen Latifah) once a week. If they can stick with the program theyll each earn half the cash. At first they try to make things work. Joy hesitantly moves into Jacks grimy Brooklyn bachelor pad and Jack reluctantly agrees to sleep on the couch. But it seems clear that theyll never last a month together let alone six. So egged on by their predictably obnoxious best friends (Lake Bell and Rob Corddry) each plans to get all the money by forcing the other to back down. We know exactly where this is going because weve already seen it in countless recent movies from ""The Break-Up"" to ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days."" Jack leaves the toilet seat up; Joy covers every surface with scented candles. He spills her secrets; she invites his hypercritical father (Treat Williams) over for dinner. And on and on until finally they wake up one day and - well we dont want to spoil anything. But while Diaz and Kutcher make their cliched characters as likable as possible you can bet on this Any movie named after an already-stale ad campaign isnt likely to gamble on the unexpected.

But by being a smidge smarter than the average date movie it makes the first-time meeting the battle of the sexes and the bumpy course of true love entertaining despite overfamiliarity. (View showtimes here) Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher are New Yorkers in need of a change. Ambitious Wall Street trader Joy (Diaz) has just been dumped in front of all her friends by her self-involved boyfriend. Slacker man-child Jack (Kutcher) has been shown the door at the family woodworking business by his own father. Eager to forget their sorrows they each zoom off to Sin City for a weekend of debauchery where they meet pound back kamikaze shots and marry just for the sheer drunken hell of it. Hungover remorseful and awake to their utter incompatibility the next day they resolve to divorce immediately. Then Jack uses Joys quarter in a slot machine wins a 3 million jackpot and she insists the relationship is back on -- until there can be a division of assets in court. Since these events occur in a parallel universe of romantic contrivance they land in the court of a judge (grouchy Dennis Miller) who threatens to freeze their bank account unless they make an attempt to save the relationship. With regular visits to a court-appointed relationship therapist the judge sentences the accidental couple to ""six months hard marriage."" This sets the stage for a Gatling-gun spray of gags in which Jack and Joy try to drive one another into leaving the marriage thus forfeiting the Vegas windfall. She invites a bevy of bimbos to their place aiming to get photographic evidence of him breaking the marriage vows. His brand of sabotage involves bodily fluids booby-trapped toilets and popcorn seasoned with pubic hair. WHAT HAPPENS IN VEGAS  OUT OF FOUR STARS RATING PG-13 FOR SOME SEXUAL AND CRUDE CONTENT AND LANGUAGE INCLUDING A DRUG REFERENCE. The contemporary formula of bad taste for the guys and underlying sweetness for the girls is used to good effect here. The crass gags are leavened with moments of endearing sentiment as the battling couple gradually begin to see each others good qualities. The quality of the acting is generally high especially Rob Corddrys appearance as Jacks goofball best friend and lawyer. Diaz and Kutcher are likable screen presences and their dewy-eyed glances set the cute meter on high. They also operate well within their comfort zones. Her role relies a lot on her being gorgeous while he gets to indulge in the sort of rude antics that made for good episodes of ""Punkd."" Joys orderly approach to life convinces Jack to take his career as a furnituremaker seriously and his sense of fun persuades her boss that shes not a soulless grind and therefore worthy of a big promotion. As they begin to set aside their selfishness and warm to each other you can almost sense the widening smiles in the audience. After ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"" is there really a need for another movie about an adolescent man redeemed by the love of a pulled-together woman? As long as people need to believe in the power of love and happy endings the answer is probably yes.

"What Happens in Vegas (PG-13)  | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies What Happens in Vegas (PG-13)  The overwhelming sensation of deja vu you get from What Happens in Vegas is exhausting and disorienting. Ashton Kutcher plays Jack Fuller and Cameron Diaz plays Joy McNally in a scene from ""What Happens in Vegas."" PhotoAP Photo/20th Century Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle Miami Herald The latest uptight chick/slacker dude romantic comedy is so formulaic you could win big if you placed bets on whats going to happen next. You dont need the trailers to tell you that workaholic just-dumped Joy (Cameron Diaz) and commitmentphobe recently unemployed Jack (Ashton Kutcher) will meet get drunk get hitched and get rich one night in Vegas. Or that they will end up in court over the 3 million he wins at a slot machine (with her quarter). Or that the long-suffering and cranky judge (Dennis Miller) irate over their cavalier attitude toward wedlock will order them to live together for six months or neither will get any money. Judges are so crazy So Joy and Jack move into his disgusting apartment complete with a neon beer sign and filthy toilet and try earnestly to drive each other crazy in hopes of forcing a surrender and claiming all the money. What Happens in Vegas is not as dreadful as screenwriter Dana Foxs last movie (the horrific The Wedding Date so dangerously bad that it could legitimately destroy the sanctity of marriage as we know it). Vegas has a few amusing gags and its not as painful to watch as that other recent and whimsically misogynistic ode to ill-conceived weddings (Made of Honor). Its neither as crude nor as over-the-top as the recent Judd Apatow-produced Forgetting Sarah Marshall nor is it as imaginative or raucously funny. Diaz doesnt have much to do but impressively bust open champagne bottles with a knife and wear tight clothes and Kutchers model looks block the scruffy believability Apatows loser boys have. But hes good at playing a goof-off and actually pulls off the few romantic scenes better than you might expect. Still the overwhelming sensation of deja vu is exhausting and disorienting. You really have seen it all before ridiculous psychological battles (he pees in the sink; she sends over a bevy of hot women to lure him into cheating); their squabbling best friends (Rob Corddry Lake Bell) taking sides; the inevitable moments when both Joy and Jack realize theyre falling in love. Maybe I shouldnt have given away that last development but hey -- odds are you figured it out long before the opening credits were over anyway. Cast Cameron Diaz Ashton Kutcher Rob Corddry Lake Bell Director Tom Vaughan Screenwriter Dana Fox Producers Michael Aguilar Dean Georgaris Shawn Levy A 20th Century Fox release.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post From here on out I will think of the trailer for the disastrous ""What Happens in Vegas"" starring Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz as a short film. Loved the short. Hated the feature. Who knew the title wasnt simply clever (inviting the rejoiner ""stays in Vegas"") but a dire warning of a bad movie ahead? A stock trader in New York City Joy McNally (Diaz) is trying to master her universe. Her boss Richard Banger (whose name becomes the thin excuse for a joke) veers toward chauvinism. Her female competition on the floor Chong (Michelle Krusiec of ""Greys Anatomy"") teeters toward an unpleasant depiction of Asian drive. Joys fiance Mason is a driven Crackberry type. When he kisses her on the forehead at the movies start were pretty sure he doesnt deserve her. Yet soon enough Mason dumps her. Kutchers Jack is the slacking son of a lumberyard owner. You have the feeling Dad (Treat Williams) should enjoy him more. Instead he cans him. This is the problem ""What Happens in Vegas"" is the sort of programmatic romantic comedy that forces one to ponder the arranged marriages of romantic-comedy casting. ""Beautiful people stay in this movie make it work"" the matchmakers of movie-star chemistry might have brayed behind the scenes. But Diaz and Kutcher cant. After all its a clumsy set-up and two bossy best friends that land strangers Jack and Joy in Sin City where they meet drink and wed. In the light of day they agree to end it -- only to win 3 million at a slot machine. Back in New York City an irascible divorce judge (Dennis Miller) sentences them to six months of hard marriage in which they must prove to a court-appointed therapist (Queen Latifah) that they are working on their relationship. Otherwise the winnings stay frozen. What follows is a lot of contempt and inklings of fondness. Rob Corddry and Lake Bell play Jack and Joys best friends Hater and Tipper. They provide unfiltered contempt in the battle of the sexes. Directed by Tom Vaughan and penned by Dana Fox (who adapted the egregious yet better ""The Wedding Date"") ""What Happens"" squanders Kutchers puppy-dog charms and fumbles Diazs comedic vivacity. It also forces a renewed respect for Judd Apatow and company. The comedy team behind ""Knocked Up"" and ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" turns out funny tender often utterly crass characters who seem positively documentary compared with these two. Shot by Matthew Leonetti ""What Happens in Vegas"" looks tacky. Given the title maybe that was the aim. But how do you make Diaz and Queen Latifah look bad? The setup doesnt deserve the fuzzy feelings it summons as the inevitable nears. (Pavlov says ""Tear up."") Unlike the toilet seat whose mysterious workings Joy tries to train Jack in (it goes up and down down and up) ""What Happens in Vegas"" goes down then down then down. ""What Happens in Vegas"" PG-13 for some sexual and crude content and languageincluding a drug reference. 1 hour 39 minutes.

By Peter Rainer May 9 2008 Save for later Saved It was inevitable that an annoying catchphrase would one day become the title for an annoying movie. ""What Happens in Vegas"" is not only annoying its also incompetent - a bad mix. Virtually jokeless - not for want of trying - this comedy starring Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher tries to get by on star power where none really exists.Diaz plays Joy McNally an emotionally repressed stock trader who doesnt think she measures up to the snooty Wall Street fiance (Jason Sudeikis) who ends up dumping her. Kutchers Jack Fuller is a party animal who works - sort of - for his fathers furnituremaking business. When Dad (Treat Williams) gives him the heave-ho he heads to Vegas for a rowdy weekend where he and Joy nursing her own hurts meet cute. Or in this case not-so-cute.According to the rules of romantic comedy these two incipient lovebirds must of course hate each other on sight. Fair enough. But what if the reasons for hating are much more convincing than the ultimate laws of attraction? Despite the films fatuous Made for Each Other scenario these two seem like a mismatch from the start. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Part of the problem lies in the casting. Although Kutcher certainly looks the part of a good-time layabout he mugs his way through the entire movie cuing us when to laugh just in case we dont find him funny. And casting Diaz as an uptight insecure stock trader would have made more sense if director Tom Vaughan had not featured her in outfits more befitting a cocktail waitress. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? What Happens in Vegas Annoying and incompetent The premise of the film is that Jack and Joy hammered in Vegas get married and to top it off win a 3 million dollar slot-machine jackpot. Seeking an annulment they end up before a judge (Dennis Miller also miscast) who orders them to cohabitate for six months and make the marriage work - or else no dough for anybody.It takes an unconscionably long time for these two to figure out they love each other during which time Joy throws umpteen tantrums throws mangoes at Jack in the middle of a busy New York street and instructs him on the finer use of toiletries. He could use the instruction but do we need to see it? Grade D+ (Rated PG-13 for sexual and crude content and language drug reference.)

Comments (1) What Happens in Vegas Recommended The felicitous pairing of Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher overcomes the mechanical setup of this amiable screwball comedy about mismatched Manhattanites who wed in Las Vegas following a drunken first date. Shes a detail-obsessed Wall Street trader on the rebound; hes just been fired from his familys furnishings business. Annulment seems like a good idea the morning after but complications bring them before a New York judge (Dennis Miller) who orders them to make good on their vows for a six-month trial period. Thats when the picture takes off as the newlyweds lob insults and furiously scheme to break the tie that binds. Tom Vaughan (Starter for Ten) directed from Dana Foxs madcap screenplay. With Dennis Farina and Queen Latifah. PG-13 99 min.

"Vegas misses the jackpot - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review Vegas misses the jackpot Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher play a hastily wed couple who must remain married for six months before they can split 3 million. (K.C. Bailey) Email|Print|Single Page| Text size - + By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / May 9 2008 A little insobriety never hurt a romantic comedy. In its whooshing prime the genre used to feature big cocktail parties where the stars flirted caroused and cavorted.Now the leads go to bars and are desperate to hold their liquor. Its last-call romantic comedy. No one is sober enough to be clever or self-possessed enough to be sexy. The hookup is the gateway to love. And thats possible only after the lovers have shared the most intimate humiliation the way strangers who walk away from horrible accidents feel close.""What Happens in Vegas"" which staggers into megaplexes today is that kind of accident. When it was over I felt vaguely embarrassed. I wasnt just leaving a movie theater. I was taking a walk of shame.This movie gives us the braying Ashton Kutcher and an intensely toned Cameron Diaz as Jack and Joy New Yorkers who meet after theyre booked in the same Vegas hotel suite. They get drunk and married. Just before breaking up they hit a 3 million jackpot and are sentenced by a judge to ""six months hard marriage"" before they can split it. Having survived this beery movie and that noisy marriage its fair to say I deserve a cut too.After the casino horseplay ends Jack and Joy return to their lives where the schemes to end the marriage begin. (Whoever violates the judges terms loses the money.) The film turns into a long two-way episode of Kutchers old ""Punkd"" show. If that sounds exciting its not. The filmmakers cut between Joy and her best friend (Lake Bell) discussing the same legal loopholes as Jack and his best friend (Rob Corddry). They concoct the same sneaky plot. And the only conclusion to be drawn from such incriminating crosscutting is that these four minds share one small brain.Kutcher gets to fake spousal abuse during mandatory couples therapy with an inexplicably cast Queen Latifah. Diaz gets to pummel Kutcher with oranges beat him with a loaf of bread and admonish him with PG-13-friendly profanity. At some point she even slides along a bar and crashes onto the floor then pops up like an exclamation point and yells. There appear to be more ""wooooos"" in Dana Foxs script than any actual words.""What Happens in Vegas"" which Tom Vaughan directed has a lousy time making the fight for money more than a sport. Neither Joy nor Jack appears to need it. Shes angling for a big Wall Street promotion. He lives in a capacious loft at the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge (on a worker-bee carpenters salary). The movie might have been way more interesting as a class comedy about a war between two broke and desperate people. Instead it wraps up with our stars more or less reminding each other as much as us that theyre loaded - and on this occasion scandalously overpaid.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

(Others might say knocking boots but they are much too literal.) Starring Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz as Jack and Joy a slacker and a workaholic who drunkenly meet mate and marry during a Sin City spree What Happens in Vegas . . . boasts the not inconsiderable appeal of good-looking people having a good time - even while having a bad time. The story follows the outline of a familiar nursery rhyme. Jack and Joy Went out to toy With all the sights of Vegas. Jack swilled Scotch And did debauch Drunk Joy who got courageous. When Jack and Joy sober up in New York they file for annulment. Nuh-uh rules Judge Whopper (Dennis Miller) who sentences the impulse twins to six months ""hard marriage."" If either fails to comply s/he will not share joint custody of a 3 million slots jackpot that Jack won with Joys quarter. So there they are. He shaggy and goofy as an oversized Newfoundland pup; she wiry and tense as an overbred whippet. Will these opposites find a way to share a kennel without nipping at each other? Not really and therein lies the films agreeable if predictable humor. Prior to Joys weekend in Vegas the finicky commodities trader was booted unceremoniously from her digs. Thus even more punishing for her than having to live with Jack is having to share his bachelor pad maintained about as nicely as a filling-station restroom. For Jack the situation is equally dire. An underachieving furniture-maker lately fired from his job Jack is emasculated by his high-achieving spouse. Kutcher the underrated comedian and charm machine who did fine work in Guess Who? and A Lot Like Love has been at the edge of superstardom for so long that I will repeat of his work here Yesterdays jackass is destined to be tomorrows Tom Hanks. Similarly Diaz the perhaps overrated lust object and charm machine here creates another cocktail of toughness and vulnerability the necessary ingredients for the rom-com heroine in a formula film. Their chemistry goes like this He cleans up real nice; she dirties down with gusto. The stars are supported hilariously by Lake Bell as Joys snarkastic best friend and Rob Corddry comic-relief pitcher from the Jon Stewart bullpen as Jacks. Queen Latifah (as a marriage counselor) and Dennis Farina (as Joys boss) round out an affable cast. What Happens in Vegas . . . 1/2 (out of four stars) Directed by Tom Vaughan. With Cameron Diaz Ashton Kutcher Lake Bell Rob Corddry and Queen Latifah. Distributed by 20th Century Fox. Running time 1 hour 39 mins.

Or in New York where most of this predictable uninspired film takes place. Or in Hollywood where such lamebrained ideas are hatched. It should have stayed anywhere really anywhere that would keep it out of theaters. And yet . . . there is something that keeps the film from tumbling off the cliff completely. Ashton Kutcher? Nope though hes not bad. Cameron Diaz? No shes pretty bad. But Rob Corddry and Lake Bell as the not-so-happy couples friends are a hoot; Corddry is often hilarious. (Best Corddry non sequitur ""Did I invent hip-hop? No but I was there."") A movie about the two of them wouldnt have been Citizen Kane but it would have been better than this. Alas were stuck with the movie weve got. Kutcher plays Jack Fuller an underachiever who whenever the going gets tough has a simple solution quit. Diaz meanwhile plays Joy McNally an ultra-uptight overly organized sort who as her friends note make plans to make plans. Jack gets fired - by his dad - and Joy gets dumped by her would-be fiance (Jason Sudeikis funny in a small role). Jack and Joy wind up in Las Vegas on a spur-of-the-moment jaunt - in the same hotel room. Contrived much? But What Happens in Vegas . . . is just getting started. After a drunken night on the town Jack and Joy wind up - why not? - married. Neither wants to be but as theyre planning their breakup Jack hits a 3 million jackpot on a slot machine using Joys quarter. Jack wants the money. Joy wants the money. So just split it right and go your separate ways? Please. Have you never been to a bad movie? Instead they wind up in court where a judge played by Dennis Miller pretty much as Dennis Miller decides they have to work on their marriage and sentences them to . . . sigh . . . ""six months of hard marriage."" Joy moves into Jacks apartment and they set about scheming hoping to scam each other out of the money. How predictable is the plot? They fight over Jack leaving the toilet seat up. While were being predictable what are the chances that they might fall for each other? Hey you have been to a bad movie. The only surprise is how mean-spirited some of their schemes are. There are some amusing moments along the way most courtesy of Corddry as well as Zach Galifianakis as Jacks friend who has a serious crush on Joy. Kutcher has an easy charm as well as a comfort with the material that Diaz does not. But he like the rest of the cast is trapped in a bad plot without any hope of escape (the film was written by Dana Fox and directed by Tom Vaughan). What Happens in Vegas . . . isnt a total bust thanks to Corddry and Bell. But its a long way from hitting the jackpot. Reach Goodykoontz at 602- 444-8974 or bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Bailey) B- What Happens in Vegas Genre Comedy; Starring Cameron Diaz Ashton Kutcher Queen Latifah; Director Tom Vaughan; Author Dana Fox; Release Date Wide 05/09/2008; Runtime (in minutes) 99; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor 20th Century Fox Film Corporation Posted May 16 2008 -- 1200 AM EDT Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz hate on each other with dynamite verve in What Happens in Vegas. The Punch and Judy fireworks get off to an early start when the two wake up in Las Vegas only to learn that they got hitched during what should have been a sloshed one-night stand. To lay claim to a 3 million slot-machine payoff (one pulled the lever the other provided the quarter) the two are forced to live together for six months as husband and wife and I would say that the romantic hilarity just ensues from there except that Kutcher and Diaz diss each other with such eye-rolling fang-baring sexually sarcastic conviction that you may think youve wandered into a dinner-theater revival of Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf? starring (and rewritten by) Jimmy Kimmel and Sarah Silverman. He declares she is a childish slob who wouldnt know how to carry on a relationship with the hair balls in his sink; she declares he is a control-freak snob who doesnt think shes good enough to be loved. The insults fly with whip-crack timing except that I missed what the old comedies of masculine-feminine venom like It Happened One Night used to have which is a spark of affection rolling around the embers of anger. Kutcher who gives his most energized performance to date and Diaz darting between the caustic and shrill look as if theyre warming up to groovy hate sex not love which may be why the film goes flat the moment it turns friendly.

"What Happens in Vegas | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; what-happens-in-vegas ) What Happens in Vegas (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli What Happens in Vegas takes the ""thin line between love and hate"" approach to the romantic comedy. Its a time honored tradition the characters begin as antagonists but end up madly in love. Along the way sparks fly. In this case director Tom Vaughan starts his protagonists out as if theyre in The War of the Roses but concludes with them in the grip of emotions that make it impossible to live without one another. The films misstep - and it is a significant one - is to take too long to tone down the broad cartoonish portrayals of the leads into something resembling human beings. As a result the first half of What Happens in Vegas plays like shrill sit-com material. The stars are Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher both of whom have shown themselves to be comfortable in rom-com surroundings. This isnt one of the great romantic couplings of our generation but the two play well enough off one another that it works and with so many bad pairings gracing the screen in recent years thats about all one can ask for. Kutcher plays Jack Fuller a slacker whose life is so rootless that he cant even hold down a job working for his father. Hes a laid-back commitment-phobe whos most at home at a party where the majority of the attendees are unattached attractive women. For Kutcher its a role he could perform in his sleep. Cameron Diaz is a harder sell as Joy McNally a Wall Street juggernaut who schedules every moment of her day. These two end up in Vegas when they need a break from the hard knocks of New York. Jack and his best buddy Hater (Rob Corddry) head to Sin City following Jacks dismissal from work. Joy and her gal pal Tipper (Lake Bell) are there after Joys fiancA(c) gives her the heave-ho. Jack and Joy meet when they are mistakenly given keys to the same hotel suite (something that happens all the time in romantic comedies but almost never in real life). Soon theyre getting drunk and getting hitched. When they wake up the next morning they start planning their respective exit strategies (Annulment? Divorce?) until one pull of the slot machine has them wrestling over how to split 3 million. A judge (Dennis Miller) sentences them to six months of marriage before he will decide who gets what. So in true movie fashion instead of trying to make the best of a bad situation Jack and Joy devote themselves to delivering as much misery to the other as they can manage - until that is they start to fall in love. This is one of those movies where the supporting characters have a tendency to pilfer scenes from the stars. Thus although the movie is supposed to be about Jack and Joy many viewers will want to see more of Hater and Tipper. There are times when these two make a more interesting partnership than our A-list lovers. There are a couple of high-profile actors in small roles. Dennis Miller is the judge with a nasty sense of humor (forcing two clearly incompatible people to live together for six months) and Queen Latifa is a therapist who sees through the b.s. that Jack and Joy are selling at their marriage counseling sessions. The biggest failing of What Happens in Vegas is how it handles tone and character. The first half feels a lot like every not-so-funny comedy in which everything is played broadly and the protagonists are caricatures doing and saying things loudly and behaving like the constructs of a writer who will do anything for a cheap laugh. Then as the romance kicks in things settle down. Joy and Jack show soft spots and begin to display evidence that they can be more than one-dimensional. What Happens in Vegas is a tale of two halves. Throw out the first 45 minutes and go directly to the part of the movie where the characters and situations become if not entirely appealing at least comfortable. In the romantic comedy genre What Happens in Vegas is forgettable. Years from now no one will remember it and mentions of the title will draw blank stares. Its not bad enough to sting like an infected insect bite and its not good enough to make its way to home video libraries. The movie has one thing going for it when it comes to regurgitating the expected formula it never introduces any serious ""romantic complications."" This allows the action to focus on Joy and Jack throughout rather than following one of them as he or she has a fling with an ex. (There is an ex but his screen time is strictly limited.) Diaz and Kutcher work well enough together that this isnt an unwelcome development especially once the movie disposes with its over-the-top attempts at outrageousness and starts getting us to care about their characters. Sadly about the nicest thing I can say about What Happens in Vegas is that I didnt hate it - although I suppose thats something.

""What Happens in Vegas"" leads to neo-screwball comedy in New York and the result is an undemandingly diverting and exceptionally commercial pic that should click with its target 25-and-under demo and probably woo respectable numbers of older ticketbuyers as well. Shrewdly positioned by Fox as counterprogramming to the early summer flash and filigree of ""Iron Man"" and ""Speed Racer"" this two-seated star vehicle for top-billed Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz wrings a respectable number of laughs from a formulaic scenario about attracted-opposites who bicker and back-stab their way toward happily-ever-aftering. Some trend-conscious wags wont be able to resist describing ""Vegas"" as Judd Apatow Lite since its about a self-involved slacker who becomes more directed and/or responsible as a result of his relationship with a more mature woman. But really that set-up already had whiskers long before Apatow became a brand name. In fact the roots of this new pic can be traced back to screwball comedies of the 30s and 40s. The big difference -- well OK one of several big differences -- between ""Vegas"" and those fast-paced comedy classics is that ""Vegas"" actually becomes more enjoyable as it tamps down the over-the-top helter-skelter of its early scenes. Dana Foxs screenplay pivots on impulsive decisions by two dissimilar New Yorkers to vacation in Las Vegas. Jack Fuller (Kutcher) a party-hearty underachiever takes this trip as a reward to himself after being fired by his father (Treat Williams) from a furniture-manufacturing job. Joy McNally (Diaz) a stressed-for-success commodities trader flies to Sin City to salve her bruised ego after being dumped by her fiance (Jason Sudeikis) in earshot of other guests at his surprise birthday party. Each character is accompanied by a best buddy -- a second-rate lawyer (Rob Corddry) for Jack a wisecracking cynic (Lake Bell) for Joy -- but that doesnt stop them ending a long evenings drunken revelry with a spur-of-the-moment visit to a Vegas wedding chapel. Come the morning after the regretful marrieds are ready to file for an annulment once they return home. But then Jack plays a slot machine with Joys quarter and wins a 3 million jackpot. Back in the big Apple an acerbic judge (Dennis Miller) with conservative ideas about the sanctity of matrimony refuses to resolve the dispute over the 3 million jackpot and challenges them to make the union work by sentencing them to ""six months hard marriage"" with the first one who asks out losing the cash. So ultra-organized Joy must move into Jacks sloppy apartment. And the slackerish Jack must pretend to enjoy life with a woman who makes impossible demands like putting down the toilet seat and not dumping his dirty laundry everywhere. Naturally each character tries to undermine the other in the hope of ending the cohabitation and more important seizing the money. Just as naturally the antagonists gradually warm to each other pushed steadily closer as Joy charms members of Jacks family and Jack ingratiates himself to Joys boss (Dennis Farina). There are no big surprises and only a handful of unexpected developments. But Kutcher and Diaz are undeniably appealing as they go through familiar motions in custom-fitted roles and the scene-stealing supporting players (Corddry Bell Farina and Queen Latifah as a marriage counselor) go about their petty larceny with amusing adroitness. Brit-born helmer Tom Vaughan (""Starter for 10"") tries too hard at first to emphasize free-wheeling zaniness but settles into a smoother groove to keep this utterly disposable but lightly entertaining pic afloat. Tech values are mostly unremarkable. Las Vegas scenes are conspicuously lacking in the snap and pizzazz auds have come to expect from interludes in the gambling mecca.
