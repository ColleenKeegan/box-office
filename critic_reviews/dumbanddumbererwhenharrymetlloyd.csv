Heres the answer ... By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Dumb and Dumberer is a misnomer. The movie should have been called The Dumbest because it no doubt will emerge as this summers most inane release. Eric Christian Olsen left plays Lloyd while Derek Richardson dumbs it down as Harry in a Dumb prequel It makes its silly predecessor Dumb and Dumber look like Oscar material. At least the 1994 film had some bona fide laughs and stars who can act (Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels). It also had the Farrelly brothers -- masters of the comic gross-out genre but also clever writers -- at the helm. Review of the movie Dumb and Dumberer When Harry Met Lloyd ( out of four) Stars Eric Christian Olsen Derek Richardson Eugene Levy Director Troy Miller Distributor New Line Cinema Rating PG-13 for crude and sex-related humor and language. Opens Friday nationwide Nothing in Dumb and Dumberer can make up for the horrendous script by Robert Brenner and Troy Miller who also directed this prequel. Lloyd (Eric Christian Olsen) literally runs into Harry (Derek Richardson) on his first day of school and a misfit friendship is born. They are put in a bogus special-needs class by a corrupt high school principal (Eugene Levy) and his lunch-lady girlfriend (Cheri Oteri) whos almost as dense as the doltish duo and downright embarrassing as a two-bit femme fatale. And speaking of embarrassing a few scenes send cringes through the audience such as when Lloyds melted chocolate bar smeared on the bathroom walls is mistaken for excrement. In Theres something About Mary the gross gags were hilarious. Here theyre just vile. The presence of co-stars like Levy (Bringing Down the House) Luis Guzman (Out of Sight) and Shia LaBeouf (Holes) makes one lament the time money and talent wasted in this humorless debacle.

Starring Eric Christian Olsen and Derek Richardson. Directed by Troy Miller. (PG-13. 88 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Dumb and Dumberer When Harry Met Lloyd "" sounded like a bad idea and the movie removes all doubt. Inspired by the very funny 1994 hit ""Dumb and Dumber "" the film contains nothing that made the original a success -- namely its stars Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey  and the filmmakers the Farrelly brothers. But it does give us the back story on how Harry met Lloyd because well everybodys interested right? To call this effort misguided would be kind. The job this ""prequel"" does on the original ""Dumb and Dumber"" is the movie equivalent of surgery that removes all the vital organs and then gives the patient a prosthetic third arm. Whats needed isnt there and whats here we dont need. Even the the title is off. ""Dumb and Dumberer"" is hard to say and not exactly funny while the subtitle is intended (for some reason) to evoke ""When Harry Met Sally"" but it sounds more like a tribute to the silent comedian Harold Lloyd. Why not ""When Buster Met Keaton?"" or ""When Charlie Met Chaplin?"" The movie leaves two young actors twisting in the wind imitating people funnier than themselves while working off a script that Carrey and Daniels couldnt have squeezed laughs from. Two young idiots who will some day blossom into glorious imbecility meet on the way to high school when they collide into each other on the street. Lloyd (Eric Christian Olsen in the Carrey role) takes Harry (Derek Richardson in the Daniels role) under his wing and shows him the ropes at school. Within minutes the class bully has hung both of them from the top of the schools flagpole. The bit is no funnier to watch than it is to read about. In moving the Carrey and Daniels character into adolescence ""Dumb and Dumberer"" keeps Lloyds personality intact but loses the weariness that Daniels brought to the role of Harry -- the weariness that is of going through life year after year without a clue. Its what made Daniels funnier than Carrey in the original but in the new film that aspect of Harrys personality is gone and Richardson is left to play him as a wide-eyed innocent. For those keeping score Lloyd was dumber in the first movie while this time Harry is dumberer. Eugene Levy plays the embezzling high school principal who is given plot- pushing lines such as ""I think I figured out how to bilk this school out of enough money for that condo in Waikiki."" Levys scenes with his partner crime the school lunch lady (Cheri Oteri) have comic energy enough so that were the sound off one might suspect that fun stuff is happening but its not. Its just Levy and Oteri holding up their end making sure theyre not the worst thing in the picture. Its hard to say whats the worst thing -- Olsen and Richardson perhaps in a dead heat -- but theyre also the movies biggest victims. Richardson at least gets to be bland. Olsen has the misery of imitating Carreys physical shtick the walk the talk the goofy takes. And while anyone can be funny imitating Jerry Lewis theres nothing less funny in the entire world than someone imitating Carrey. Its even worse than someone imitating Steve Martin singing ""King Tut"" which happily no one does anymore though the nightmares will never fade. At less than 90 minutes ""Dumb and Dumberer"" still feels stretched with back-to-back musical interludes halfway in that seem like a desperate attempt to string things out. In one musical moment Lloyd dances to Vanilla Ices 1990 hit ""Ice Ice Baby"" even though the movie is set in 1986. Thats how dumb he is dancing to music that hasnt even been recorded yet. . This movie contains sexual situations and crude humor.

Story Tools RELATED  CNN.com  Reviews archive (CNN) -- With a title like ""Dumb and Dumberer When Harry Met Lloyd"" you cant say you havent been warned. This movie lives down to its name. Its a prequel not a sequel and takes place in 1986 before the events of 1994s ""Dumb and Dumber."" That movie starred Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels and was co-directed by Peter and Bobby Farrelly. No sign of any of those talents this time. The movie was directed by Troy Miller -- whose previous theatrical venture was 1998s awful ""Jack Frost"" -- and co-written by Robert Brenner doing his first screenplay. The two apparently belong to the pasta school of filmmaking. Theyve taken hundreds of jokes in search of punchlines and thrown them at a wall like spaghetti in a vain effort to see what sticks. Unfortunately 99 percent of the noodles end up on the floor. ""Dumb and Dumberers"" Harry is played by newcomer Derek Richardson and its Lloyd is played by Eric Christian Olsen. Theyre teenagers who meet at high school in a class for ""special"" students -- appropriate since this is a very ""special"" movie. If you think its funny you may just be ""special"" too. Wasted talent Eugene Levy is a conniving principal and Cheri Oteri his lunch lady accomplice in ""Dumb and Dumberer."" The films one -- and only -- saving grace is Richardsons and Olsens uncanny resemblance to Carrey and Daniels from the first feature. Of course the crude wigs help but the two actors have also captured the attitudes movements and occasionally even the timing of the original stars. Olsen also lost 20 pounds in order to look more like a young Carrey. On the other hand Miller and Brenner have captured none of the Farrelly brothers comedic magic. Mercifully most of the actors in this ill-fated endeavor are unknowns and their careers will recover. However Eugene Levy Cheri Oteri (""Saturday Night Live"") and Mimi Rogers (who plays Harrys mother) are flirting with putting their careers on life support by appearing in this swill. Seeing them flail away in this mindless mess is akin to watching a train wreck -- albeit a wreck that lasts 82 long minutes before its merciful conclusion. Levy plays the high school principal who along with Oteris lunch lady is planning on stealing 100000 from a fund earmarked for children with ""special needs."" All they need are some ""special"" students to fill a fake class and of course Harry and Lloyd are the star pupils. Our mindless heroes recruit a bunch of other misfits and before you can say ""sophomoric humor"" (an insult to sophomores) the class is engaging in one lame misadventure after another. Oteri is so over the top and Levy is so mechanical youll be embarrassed for them. Someone should hold a TV telethon to raise money for these two so that theyll never have to work again -- unless theyre in a movie by Christopher Guest. Worse and worser Enter the beautiful Jessica Matthews (Rachel Nichols) who works for the school paper. She alone suspects that the principal and the lunch lady are up to no good -- two words youll mutter repeatedly while viewing this film. Jessica then uses unwitting nitwits Harry and Lloyd to get the inside dirt needed to expose their crime. Despite this uh premise the results are spectacularly unfunny. You can hardly blame New Line Cinema for wanting to milk the cash cow that ""Dumb and Dumber"" created in theaters and video stores. But the first installment -- unlike this prequel -- felt truly original (in a stupid kind of way) and the talents of Carrey Daniels and the Farrelly brothers created a amusing blend of idiotic slapstick humor. Unfortunately ""Damp;D2"" will have you cringing instead of laughing. Youll also feel your IQ dropping at least five points while watching it. In all ""Dumb and Dumberer"" isnt betterer. In fact its a whole lot less funnerer. ""Dumb and Dumberer"" is rated PG-13. Nobody with an IQ over 13 will think it worthwhile.

"Dumb and Dumberer | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; dumb-and-dumberer ) Dumb and Dumberer (United States 2003) A movie review by James Berardinelli Just when I thought it was safe to go back in theaters on Friday the 13th a with Jason having decided to postpone his duel with Robert Englunds nightmare-prowling pizza face until later in the summer a along comes a seemingly innocent movie that has forced me to acknowledge that horror comes in many forms. I could start this review by stating that Dumb and Dumberer lives up to its name or by calling it stupid moronic and idiotic but I believe that approach is a trap since a movie like this might relish being the object of such bland invectives. Instead let me try a few that cant possibly be misconstrued as twisted praise unfunny boring torturous and unwatchable. This is just about as bad as it gets (although to be fair no one tries to masturbate an animal). There isnt a single amusing moment to be found during the movies interminable 83 minute running time. And heres a clear indication of just how lackluster things get watching the illuminated second hand of my watch tick away the seconds offered more entertainment than what was playing on the screen. When the picture started it was out of frame. People in the audience jeered at the projectionist to fix it. Little did they know that Dumb and Dumberer would play better that way. Dumb and Dumberer (which at some point during its production history went by the name of Dumber and Dumbest) is a prequel to the 1994 feature Dumb and Dumber. Wisely none of the principals involved with the earlier film wanted anything to do with this misbegotten stepchild. The Farrelly Brothers who wrote and directed passed as did stars Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. To fill the void we have Troy Miller a veteran director of numerous ""Real World"" TV episodes and no-name actors Eric Christian Olsen and Derek Richardson. The most interesting thing (and I use the word ""interesting"" with great trepidation) about the movie comes from observing Olsens studied imitation of Carrey (which is pretty much on-target). Richardsons attempts to mimic Daniels are less successful. He doesnt look sound or act like the man hes supposed to be impersonating. If you concentrate hard enough while watching Dumb and Dumberer (and avoid a migraine or brain damage in the process) you can find something that resembles a plot. Its clear that the filmmakers didnt expect sentient life in the audience because they didnt put any thought into the storyline. The screenplay which appears to be in rough draft form contains some monumentally glaring inconsistencies and discontinuities but no one is supposed to notice those things and in the unlikely event that they do theyre not supposed to mention them. A little comedy can go a long way towards forgiving such laziness but the movie doesnt have a clue about the basic concept of humor. Not only do most of the jokes fall flat (sometimes because the timing is off but often because theyre not funny) but there are countless missed opportunities. Dumb and Dumberers biggest laughs are likely to come when a character runs around yelling ""shit"" seven or eight times although most people outgrow snickering at bad words when they graduate from grammar school. And when a movie can neuter a comedian of Eugene Levys considerable skill you know that the filmmakers are displaying a monumental level of ineptitude. Levy is so flat that watching his ""performance"" I was embarrassed for him. The movie takes place in 1986 and chronicles the storied meeting between Lloyd Christmas (Olsen) and Harry Dunne (Richardson) two high school outsiders. When the schools principal (Eugene Levy) decides to institute a ""Special Needs"" class so he can bilk a charity fund of some money he finds his perfect first two students in Lloyd and Harry. Both boys are infatuated with a would-be teenage Lois Lane Jessica Matthews (Rachel Nichols) and they come to her aid as she works to expose the principal and his nefarious assistant Ms. Heller (Cheri Oteri). I was not a fan of Dumb and Dumber but while sitting through the sequel I would have been ecstatic to be exposed to something of equal quality. This is easily the worst movie to reach theaters since Freddy Got Fingered and the most unbearable sequel of all time (beating out Halloween 6). Usually Hollywood waits until August to empty its cinematic septic tank into multiplexes. This year the flood has started early. And no movie could be more aptly compared to raw sewage than this film.

This article was corrected on June 13 2003. In the not-so-grand tradition of ""Butch and Sundance The Early Years"" and ""The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas"" ""Dumb and Dumberer When Harry Met Lloyd"" tries to milk more cheddar from a B.O. cash cow by spinning the backstories of characters originally played by older better-known and presumably better-paid thesps. In this case newcomers Eric Christian Olsen and Derek Richardson are teen versions of the dim bulbs originally essayed by Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels in the imbecilic but amazingly popular 1994 comedy that marked the co-directorial debut of Peter and Bobby Farrelly. Fitfully amusing prequel stands to post fair to middling summer box office numbers if only because previous pic -- which also inspired a mid-90s TV cartoon show -- remains a familiar brand thanks to constant homevid and cable exposure. Urge to make lightning strike twice was irresistible to producers mindful of the 1994 comedys 248 million worldwide gross. Director Troy Miller working from a script he co-wrote with Robert Brener does relatively little to tinker with the Farrelly brothers successful formula. Indeed a few of prequels comic set pieces -- including a gross-out sight gag in a bathroom and a wink-wink nudge-nudge ironic ending -- are smudged carbons of similar scenes in ""Dumb and Dumber."" Unfortunately conspicuous absence of Carrey and Daniels only serves to reinforce new pics overall resemblance to a down-market penny-pinched sitcom spin-off (or worse direct-to-video follow-up). It probably doesnt help that judging from the credits the Farrellys kept their distance. Still new lead players earn points for often uncanny accuracy of their mimicry. With almost frightening zeal Olsen reprises Carreys chipped-tooth smile and Moe Howard coiffure as Lloyd Christmas while Richardson like Daniels keeps his hair frizzy and his eyes glassy as Harry Dunne Both actors (especially Olsen) flawlessly replicate the body language and physical shtick of their predecessors. Much like the 94 comedy ""Dumb and Dumberer"" relies heavily if not exclusively on gags that pivot on blissful ignorance clueless misapprehensions and unadulterated stupidity of lead characters. (When Harry literally runs into Lloyd on the first day of high school former assumes latter must be son of Santa Claus after he learns Lloyds last name.) Humor in prequel is slightly more restrained -- i.e. less scatological -- and not quite so dependent on borderline sadism. Wispy plot involves scheme by a corrupt principal (Eugene Levy picking up an easy paycheck) and his none-too-bright lover (Cheri Oteri) to claim a 100000 grant by establishing a phony ""special needs"" class at their high school. Harry and Lloyd are selected as especially needy students and theyre soon joined by ""normal"" classmates eager to scam their way into a stress-free no-homework comfort zone. Its true of course that lowbrow gross-out comedies of this sort traditionally wring laughs from subjects and situations that arent usually joked about in polite company. But gags about special needs programs (and special needs students) in a mainstream popcorn pic may be too much for even the most indulgent auds to accept. (At one point a character actually starts to ask Harry if hes ""retarded"" but is too embarrassed to get the word out.) Dont be surprised if there are picket lines at the megaplexes this week. Tech values are sufficient to passably evoke prequels 1986 time frame. Dumb and Dumberer When Harry Met LloydProductionA New Line Cinema release of a Brad Krevoy/Charles B.
