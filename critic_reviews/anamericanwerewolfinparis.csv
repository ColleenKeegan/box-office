Adopting the same mix of shocks and yocks as John Landis 1981 London-based scare comedy ""An American Werewolf in Paris"" starts off gangbusters as an entertaining knowing ride but loses its compass midway on. Though it looks unlikely to become a howling success in any one market theatrically energetic pic should accrue red-blooded returns on a worldwide basis with a long afterlife in ancillaries. Set for Yank release on Christmas Day pic opens today in Great Britain. The movies choppy tempo bears witness to extensive testing and subsequent tweaking over a long period (initial shoot was in summer 96); theres little spare flesh in the running time and the mix of absurd comedy action and f/x is rarely allowed to stand still long enough to congeal. Though pulled together under the banner of London-based sales company and production house Jamp;M Entertainment its a truly international pudding creatively helmed by a British-trained director with strong German connections (Anthony Waller of ""Mute Witness"" fame) acted by a mixed Yank-French cast shot in Luxembourg Paris Amsterdam and New York f/x-ed largely by California-based Santa Barbara Studios and with a major dose of German-based talent behind the camera and in post-production. Operatic main title swooping down over Notre Dame with Wilbert Hirschs ""Omen""-like music thundering away features a man escaping from the sewers of Paris and then being dragged back inside by some unseen beastie. Having staked out its flashy horror territory pic then cuts to three young Americans at loose in Europe -- sensitive romantic Andy (Tom Everett Scott) and his two girl-chasing pals Brad (Vince Vieluf) and Chris (Phil Buckman). Clandestinely climbing the Eiffel Tower at night the trio prepare for Andys spectacular ""dare"" -- bungee-jumping from the Parisian landmark. But theres a fourth person up there whos ready to jump without a safety harness Serafine (Julie Delpy) who stares mournfully at the waxing moon before plummeting into the void to be saved (in an exhilarating blend of music and effects) by Andy who jumps after her only to lose her on the ground. Finally tracking her down again Andy invites her out on a date though from her sudden display of superhuman strength in a cafe and interest in blood-soaked human organs its obvious Serafine is not your average French babe. After an action-filled night at a cellar party to welcome the full moon Andy wakes up in her bed to find tooth marks on his leg -- and her news that hes already halfway to becoming a werewolf. Up to this point the movie is an enjoyably trashy blend of impressive special effects low-key refs to Landiss movie and sudden moments of horror breaking the jokey tone. For the next reel too Waller manages to crank up the humor and shocks without losing the balance Andy gets a sudden liking for rare steaks and (in a ref to the Landis) meets his now ""undead"" friend Brad for a chat. Thereafter however pic progressively careens out of control -- largely dumping character and rational plot development in favor of one set piece after another capped by a series of increasingly frantic climaxes and a bolted-on coda (""several full moons later"") thats structurally neat but makes no logical sense at all. While Wallers cult hit ""Mute Witness"" was all pregnant atmosphere and not much delivery ""Werewolf"" is all delivery and not much pregnant atmosphere. For undiscerning viewers this may be enough The impressive entirely computer-generated werewolves are effectively scary and give the pic an energetic blatantly genre feel heightened by Peter Adams shock cutting. But to the movies loss the humor becomes more and more hit-and-miss as events unfold. In the films most outrageous joke Andy publicly seduces a horny American tourist (Julie Bowen) by sticking his newly sensitive nose up her skirt; later on a straight-faced Serafine tells Andy how her stepfather (the man killed at the start) had almost perfected a drug to suppress her ""lycanthropic cycle."" But such laughs unfortunately become rarer as the plot tries to cram in everything from werewolves-bent-on-world-domination to the central love story while keeping all the original characters in the frame. Scott (""That Thing You Do"") is OK as Andy but gets most of his acting chances in the first half; ditto the English-fluent Delpy as Serafine though her attraction to the exasperating hero needs to be taken more on trust than from anything in the script. Vieluf and Buckman are reliable as Andys pals. French thesps Thierry Lhermitte and Tom Novembre are mostly limited to mugging in tiny roles the first as a Clouseau-like doctor the second as a Maigret clone. Other technical credits are effective though color processing ranges from muddy in night and studio work to fine in daytime exteriors. Buffs may note a vague hint in the finished film that Delpys character is in fact the offspring of David Naughton and Jenny Agutter in ""An American Werewolf in London.""

Starring Tom Everett Scott and Julie Delpy. Directed by Anthony Waller. (R. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) When its springtime in Paris a young mans thoughts turn to ripping out hearts with his fangs. But wait. Lets not get ahead of ourselves. ""An American Werewolf in Paris"" which opens today is about one very colorful vacation in a young mans life. He goes to Paris and meets a girl. OK shes a werewolf sure but . . . is there anything more adorable than French actress Julie Delpy saying the word ""werewolf"" (pronounced ""wayer-wooof"")? The grand thing about love is that it enables us to see with our emotions and overlook our lovers faults. A good example of this comes in the scene in which Seraphine played by Delpy tells our hero that after a recent rampage she woke up and ""realized I had butchered my parents."" ""Its not your fault"" answers Andy played by Tom Everett Scott. In the first flush of infatuation its easy to ignore the warning signs. Seraphine the sad French beauty and Andy the American in Paris meet for the first time under circumstances that are by now the stuff of cinematic cliche. She with a single tear running down her cheek is about to throw herself off the Eiffel Tower. He tries to talk her down. What is it about men rescuing young women from committing suicide -- and always that particular suicide in which the women threat en to throw themselves off something? It happens in ""Titanic."" It happens in the old Von Sternberg film ""Docks of New York."" It even happens in a Fred and Ginger dance number in ""Follow the Fleet."" Obviously this is some kind of male fantasy but its not a rescue fantasy. Its the fantasy of meeting a beautiful woman who is so miserable and desperate that she might be willing to give a guy a shot. Compared with getting splattered whats the harm of dinner and a movie? To its credit ""American Werewolf in Paris"" comes up with a new twist She does jump -- and he jumps after her. You see he happened to be preparing to bungee jump from the tower when she dropped by. In a highly nifty little sequence he catches her in midair and sets her gently down on the sidewalk. Cool or what? The picture was directed by Anthony Waller who made a superb low-budget thriller called ""Mute Witness"" last year. He might have been better off with a low budget here. Instead of putting excessive hair on his werewolves along the lines of Lon Chaney Jr. the great wolfman of yore Waller goes the computer graphics route. His werewolves look angry ferocious and very computer generated. One wonders why the victims dont just step outside the blue screen. The appeal of the two leads goes a long way. Shes a werewolf and doesnt want to be. He becomes a werewolf and finds the lifestyle spiritually and emotionally unsatisfying. To an extent not completely obliterated by the relentless rock n roll soundtrack and the frenetic scenes of carnage Andy and Seraphines relationship has the overtones of a tragic love affair. Delpy and Scott are able to put it over. Shes French and deep and mysterious. Hes a fresh-faced American an open book. Liking them makes it possible to (kinda) like this otherwise routine horror movie.

"American Werewolf in Paris An | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; american-werewolf-in-paris-an ) American Werewolf in Paris An (United States/France/United Kingdom 1997) A movie review by James Berardinelli An American Werewolf in Paris is a failed attempt to recapture the humor and horror of John Landis 1981 feature An American Werewolf in London. Where the original had comedy the sequel has the kind of revolting silliness that can be found in TV sit-coms. Where the first installment had chills this one has sequences that are inappropriately unintentionally funny. In short while An American Werewolf in London has become something of a minor classic in its genre the woeful An American Werewolf in Paris seems destined for late nights on Cinemax (it even has the necessary gratuitous nudity). The film opens with a trio of daredevil Americans -- Andy (Tom Everett Scott) Brad (Vince Vieluf) and Chris (Phil Buckman) -- sneaking up to the top of the Eiffel Tower to drink wine and do a little bungee jumping. Soon they have company in the person of Serafine (Julie Delpy) who has decided to end it all. She jumps but Andy with a bungee cord attached goes after her and manages to save her (at the price of a major headache). Serafine disappears but a smitten Andy seeks her out. However once he learns his would-be girlfriends dark secret he wishes he hadnt. Shes a werewolf cursed to change into a hideous beast when the moon is full and to make matters worse he has suffered a nasty bite himself. Actress Julie Delpy is far too good for this movie. She imbues Serafine with spirit spunk and humanity which gives us an emotional stake in the characters fate. This isnt necessarily a good thing since it prevents us from relaxing and enjoying An American Werewolf in Paris as a completely mindless campy entertainment experience. Delpys injection of class into an otherwise classless production raises the specter of what this film could have been with a better script and a better cast surrounding her. Delpys previous credits include such memorable ventures as Krzysztof Kieslowskis White and Richard Linklaters Before Sunrise. She was radiant charismatic and effective in both. Given the nature and level of the material she has to work with here she gets as close as possible to those adjectives. It could be argued that Delpy is the only reason to see An American Werewolf in Paris but even her most devoted fans should consider giving this one a miss. And if your primary objective is catching a glimpse of her in the buff check out either Killing Zoe or The Passion of Beatrice -- those movies have intelligible plots in addition to breasts. The rest of the cast acts at a level considerably below that of Delpy -- which is to say they give performances appropriate for the screenplay. Tom Everett Scott (That Thing You Do) plays the lead like hes in a made-for-TV movie. It would be kind to call him bland. Actors Vince Vieluf and Phil Buckman as Andys friends are no more impressive. Julie Bowen (Happy Gilmore) is suitably fetching as werewolf meat. And respected French actor Thierry Lhermitte has a brief turn as another monster meal. On the technical side its all bad news. The computer-generated werewolves look painfully unreal. The creatures would probably have been more believable had they been men in wolf suits. Repeated use is made of the ""werewolf cam"" an infrared wolfs point-of-view approach thats interesting the first couple of times its employed then becomes tedious. And the soundtrack includes some alternative grunge rock tunes that clash violently with the on-screen action theyre matched to. Director Anthony Waller who displayed a confident edgy style in Mute Witness stumbles with this material never being able to make the comedy and horror elements gel. As a result we get the worst werewolf sequel since The Howling II Your Sister Is a Werewolf. (I will give Waller credit for killing off a dog though -- something thats rarely seen in movies these days.) An American Werewolf in Paris is marginally entertaining in a ""bad movie"" sort of way but thats a dubious distinction. Ultimately its an unfortunate effort for while it isnt unbearable to sit through it isnt a howl either.

"An American Werewolf in Paris Tall Dark And Hairy -- Thirsty Too December 25 1997 An American Werewolf in Paris Tall Dark And Hairy -- Thirsty Too Related Articles The New York Times on the Web Current Film Forum Join a Discussion on Movies By STEPHEN HOLDEN hy would three red-blooded American boys be champing at the bit to visit Paris? To visit the Louvre? No way. The only thing on the minds of these three smirking teen-age airheads who find more trouble than they could ever have anticipated in ""An American Werewolf in Paris"" is accumulating ""sex points"" on their competing mental scorecards. No sooner have they sneaked into the Eiffel Tower after visiting hours than Andy (Tom Everett Scott) the least obnoxious of the three falls literally head over heels with a weepy French girl who makes a suicide leap from the observatory. Andy who has come equipped with rope for performing his own daredevil stunts dives after her and saves her life. It turns out of course that the woman he rescues Serafine (Julie Delpy) has ample reason to want to die. She was recently turned into a werewolf by her sinister skinhead boyfriend who hangs out with his buddies in a Parisian nightclub that Andy and his pals visit. Far from loathing their lupine blood-guzzling alter egos the werewolves who run the place are sick and tired of having to wait for the moon to rise before feasting on human (preferably American) bodies. They have discovered a serum that can transform them into monsters at any time of day or night. And the climax of their nightly parties is a carnivorous drug-choreographed rampage. ""An American Werewolf in Paris"" directed by Anthony Waller is only distantly related to the 1981 John Landis film ""An American Werewolf in London"" which mixed horror and comedy with considerably more panache. A slapdash poorly acted paint-by-numbers teen horror comedy the sequel is too frenetically edited to build any suspense and its special effects are strictly bargain basement. The movie does have one nastily amusing sequence in which Andy while undergoing the metamorphosis from man into monster picks up a lustful squealing girl named Amy (Julie Bowen) who becomes increasingly aroused the more the beast in him comes out. But only up to a point. Naturally Amy is punished for her libido and quickly dispatched into the realm of the undead. But even after becoming a zombie she hasnt lost her style. Lamenting the loss of her teen-age beauty she whines petulantly about the hundreds of hours she wasted honing her shape on the StairMaster. ""An American Werewolf in Paris"" is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has scenes of gory violence some profanity and glimpses of nudity.

In An American Werewolf in Paris Tom Everett Scott the recessively holesome young actor from That Thing You Do plays an American tourist who stops off in Paris along with his frat-house-jerk buddies and hooks up with a beautiful undead cherie (Julie Delpy). Wherever he travels though--bridges punk clubs the Eiffel Tower--the locations are weirdly underpopulated and drably lit. This must be the first movie that makes the urban jewel of France look like a Roger Corman backlot. The cruddy shot-in-a-warehouse settings are especially depressing since the computer-generated special effects seem to be taking place in another movie entirely (a far livelier one). We see various actors transformed into springy lupine beasts with the heads of slavering warthogs yet the way these creatures seethe and pounce bears almost no relation to the static backgrounds. An American Werewolf in Paris actually has very little connection to the 1981 John Landis thriller An American Werewolf in London which blended scares and snarkiness in a rudely original way. The new movie has a few scenes of corpses tossing off lines like ""A guy cant rest in pieces around here"" Mostly though its an exercise in routine gore and occult tedium. Delpy the French actress with her saucer eyes and pale gaze of anxiety seems almost shell-shocked by the junkiness of it all. She may have signed on to prove her mainstream credentials but you havent seen desperation until youve watched Julie Delpy try to maintain her dignity while she fixes a milk shake out of two dripping hearts.
