The inexplicably successful first film had the zombies infected by a virus spill and penned up in an underground bunker; here the authorities make the mistake of opening up the secret lab and letting mayhem shuffle forth. Luckily theres only one road in or out to the city above so its easy to contain the outbreak leaving genetically modified security agent Milla Jovovich mini-skirted police officer Sienna Guillory and African-American comic relief Mike Epps to battle their way through the carnage and rescue an abandoned schoolgirl before the last support helicopter takes off. The setups an efficient enough construct for delivering sub-Lara Croftian power-babe action but the execution by former second-unit helmer Witt a man who never saw a glass-walled building he didnt want to explode in slow-motion is uneventful casualty count notwithstanding. The heart plummets at the prospects for a follow-up.

Posted September 24 2004 -- 1200 AM EDT Last year?s 28 Days Later and this year?s Dawn of the Dead remake were so thrilling largely because they gave us zombies formerly a tad poky on screen who sprinted like velociraptors after human flesh. In Resident Evil Apocalypse the undead are back to stumbling in the dark sometimes even in blurry slo-mo making the many packs of them about as terrifying as the mobs waiting for Matt and Katie outside the Today studio. And that?s the least of this horrid movie?s disappointments. As a vanquisher named Alice trying to get out of the plague-infested Raccoon City Milla Jovovich videogamely kicks into action with a backflip off a motorcycle after she rams it through a stained-glass cathedral window but the rest of the cast is strictly straight-to-DVD. So?s the rest of this shotgun-to-the-head movie which made a killing in its opening weekend-boding well for an apocalypse of the cinematic variety.

Carnage is everywhere. Still one cant help but yawn ones way through Resident Evil Apocalypse. As the undead trample through town with pig-like snorts the best we can do is smirk. Apocalypse Milla Jovovich goes through the video-game motions. Screen Gems The urban center where this takes place has the most inane moniker of any metropolis on the planet Raccoon City. Lurking beneath the city is The Hive a facility run by the worlds largest conglomerate Umbrella Corp. Nothings subtle here. A bioweapon virus spawned the undead and a military squad tried to fight the infectious creatures but most of the soldiers perished. One of the few survivors is Alice (Milla Jovovich) whose physique and awkward moves make her look incapable of fending off hordes of monsters. But this being based on a video game she does. (Related video Watch the Resident Evil trailer) About the movie Resident Evil Apocalypse  (out of four) Stars Milla Jovovich Mike Epps Sienna Guillory Oded Fehr Director Alexander Witt Distributor Sony Rated R for non-stop violence language and some nudity Opens Friday nationwide Joining Alice in the good fight is another pugnacious babe Jill (Sienna Guillory) who wears a tube top and the tiniest of miniskirts when dispatching her victims. Along the way they must contend with not only flesh-eating zombies but also undead blood-soaked ravenous Dobermans. And the knowledge that at any moment a nuclear bomb will be dropped to ""sanitize"" Raccoon City. If only. The human mastermind behind all this evil is Major Cain (another subtle moniker) a blandly handsome Thomas Kretschmann whose accent seems heavily inspired by Californias governor. Like Schwarzenegger he scoffs at girly men. And even girly girls. Cain is proud of the genetic altering he has done on Alice. Hes even prouder of the worst of the mutations the human biohazard named Nemesis a behemoth clad in black who clomps around in big boots. Alice in contrast remains lithe and attractive so she can prance around in skimpy clothes two-fistedly firing off rounds of ammunition. This should keep the core audience of teen boys and video game enthusiasts entertained. Not much else will. This movies predecessor Resident Evil made 100 million worldwide which is scarier than anything the screenwriters have cooked up. Should the desire to see a clever zombie movie strike try the recent remake of Dawn of the Dead or last years 28 Days. No need to spend any time in the vicinity of Resident Evil Apocalypse.

Action-horror. Starring Milla Jovovich Sienna Guillory Oded Fehr and Jared Harris. Directed by Alexander Witt. (R. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. ). You can tell a lot about a zombie movie by the quality of the undead. There are filmmakers who take the rotting flesh and exploding brains seriously (the recent ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake is a good example) and there are directors who pour oatmeal on the heads of a few dozen extras instruct them to stagger toward the camera and move on to their next project. ""Resident Evil Apocalypse"" belongs in the latter category providing zombies that are somehow less convincing than the ones from Michael Jacksons ""Thriller"" video. With a horrible script and only semi-interesting characters the movie will be particularly frustrating for fans of the Resident Evil video game franchise - which is a much better product than its big-screen counterpart. In case youve forgotten - or are trying to forget - a two-minute summary of the first ""Resident Evil"" movie is provided in the sequel. ""Resident Evil Apocalypse"" continues with the grotesque horde taking over the urban population of Raccoon City which once again looks a lot like Toronto. ""Resident Evil"" survivor Alice (Milla Jovovich) who was genetically perfected by a team of scientists to be the ultimate fighting machine joins forces with a few police officers and citizens trying to escape the quarantined and soon-to-be-nuked metropolis. Science fiction fans wont be surprised by the second-rate feel of the movie. ""Resident Evil Apocalypse"" was written by Paul W.S. Anderson director of ""Alien vs. Predator"" and the first ""Resident Evil."" Anderson who was genetically perfected by a team of scientists to create bad movies that make money anyway nearly outdoes himself here writing a script that includes a scene featuring zombie hookers. Alexander Witt takes over directorial duties but he employs all of Andersons classic techniques including using the David Letterman monkey-cam to film all the action scenes (quick-cut editing is a lot cheaper than hiring a bunch of good fight choreographers). The money he saved certainly didnt go to the main zombie villain who appears to be a big guy in a rubber suit. The budget problems would be forgivable if the movie were a little more compelling. While the best comic book movies make concessions to the real world (the X-Men wear leather not ridiculous- looking spandex costumes) the makers of ""Resident Evil"" expect us to believe that a big corporation could watch an entire citys inhabitants turn into flesh-consuming spawns of evil and then succeed in covering the disaster up. Doesnt anyone have a camera phone? ""Resident Evil Apocalypse"" would make a lot more sense if it carried a PG- 13 rating. The action looks cheap but theres plenty of it and along with the zombie dogs and scantily clad protagonists Witt and Anderson do succeed in making a lot of things blow up. Its just too bad that almost nothing in the movie seems original. The ""Thriller"" video may have featured hokey dancing zombies but at least someone was making an effort. Advisory This film contains violence gore and nudity. - Peter Hartlaub Warriors of Heaven and Earth Action-adventure. Starring Jiang Wen Vicky Zhao Wei. Written and directed by He Ping. In Mandarin with English subtitles. (R. 114 minutes. At the Galaxy.). Theres a wonderful fight between two swordsmen near the beginning of the new Chinese adventure epic ""Warriors of Heaven and Earth"" taking place in around and through a wooden cabin - a scene so exhilarating and so much fun that its almost shocking how monotonous the movie eventually becomes. Writer- director He Ping brings an agreeably old-fashioned style to this tale of two rival swordsmen who put aside their differences to escort a caravan which includes a generals daughter and a monk with a valuable Buddhist artifact safely to the emperor. But the problem is that he chose to direct this silly story with an air of ominous importance usually reserved for Holocaust epics so reverential is his leaden camera when he really needed to just lighten up. Even ""Gone With the Wind"" had its fun at times. Its filled with sword fights that eventually become repetitive and the best reason to see the film is to admire the David Lean-like Gobi desert landscapes of cinematographer Zhao Fei whose distinguished work includes Zhang Yimous ""Raise the Red Lantern"" and three Woody Allen films including ""Sweet and Lowdown."" The charismatic Jiang Wen (""Red Sorghum"") is renegade Chinese general Li who has a death sentence hanging over his head because he refused an order to execute women and children after winning a battle in Western China against invading Turkish armies. The Japanese-born emissary Lai Xi (Nakai Kiichi) is sent to execute Li but the caravan needs escorting and they agree that theyll fight to the death after they complete their mission. Naturally they become very respectful of each others skills and character so theres not much tension here even though the movie pretends there is. In fact theres not much tension at all in ""Warriors of Heaven and Earth"" so predictable is its standard-issue plot. In fact it bears a strong resemblance to a China-set Korean epic from 2001 ""Musa The Warrior"" in which Zhang Ziyi was a princess being escorted to safety. Another disappointment is the misuse of the engaging Hong Kong star Vicky Zhao Wei (""Shaolin Soccer"") a delightful screen presence who is wasted here even though her character narrates the story. Admittedly ""Warriors of Heaven and Earth"" is eminently watchable with enough majestic vistas and heroic derring-do to get by. It could have been so much more. Advisory Violent battle scenes and sword fights. - G. Allen Johnson  Henri Cartier-Bresson  The Impassioned Eye Documentary. With Isabelle Huppert Arthur Miller Elliott Erwitt Josef Koudelka and Ferdinand Scianna. Directed and written by Heinz Butler. In French with spoken English translation. (Not rated. 72 minutes. At the Roxie).. ""You cant force things"" photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson says at one point in Heinz Butlers documentary portrait of him. The director must have taken this advice to heart for his film moves leisurely from conversations with the late master who died at 95 in early August to brief interviews with such illustrious admirers as Arthur Miller Isabelle Huppert - whom Cartier- Bresson photographed - and publisher Robert Delpire. The amount of time Cartier- Bresson spends on camera represents a documentary triumph of sorts. He shied away from the camera so successfully that many viewers will be surprised to find that in his 90s he resembled both Jean Renoir who gave him one of his first jobs and the late philosopher Richard Wollheim. We see Cartier-Bresson paging through published versions of his pictures and through loose prints. He stops to comment now and then expressing satisfaction more often than providing revelations. In one exceptional case he explains the three men standing on a pedestal looking over the Berlin Wall. ""Theyre trying to see a curtain at a window"" Cartier-Bresson says ""a signal from a relative."" Few films on any subject linger on still photographs as this one does. No zooms no jump cuts just full-frame views of black and white prints. Most last for at least 10 seconds echoing Cartier-Bressons statement that ""taking a picture means holding your breath."" But does anyone still need to be persuaded of Cartier-Bressons greatness? The famous faces Butler interviewed add to our sense of the photographers accomplishment only when they supply personal details. Miller gives a little background to a famous portrait of Marilyn Monroe on the set of ""The Misfits."" Huppert says that to have Cartier-Bresson photograph her was to learn something new of herself. The photographer himself speaks uncomplainingly of certain craft difficulties and journalistic hazards but a viewer of the film misses any sense of what distinguishes a great Cartier-Bresson picture from a good one never mind a bad one. And the photographer himself cannot have been happy with the short shrift the documentary gives to drawing which occupied him through most of his last decades. - Kenneth Baker THX 1138 The George Lucas Directors Cut Science fiction drama. Starring Robert Duvall Donald Pleasence Don Pedro Colley and Maggie McOmie. Directed by George Lucas. (R. 88 minutes. At the Metreon.). ""THX 1138"" always was a misunderstood effort. When George Lucas big- screen directorial debut was released in 1971 it was frequently double billed with bad horror films even though it had more in common with thoughtprovoking classics such as ""1984."" More than three decades later mainstream audiences spoiled on special effects spectaculars including Lucas own ""Star Wars"" films are probably even less likely to ""get"" the low-budget movie. But this new highly polished upgrade is a nice gift for science fiction fans lacing an all-but-hopeless vision of the future with strains of humanity and even some subtle humor. Robert Duvall is THX 1138 who works in a factory that builds the seemingly lobotomized underground societys automated police force. He is the everyman worker drone until his mate (Maggie McOmie) cuts out his sedation pills and hes launched on a journey toward individuality. The late Donald Pleasence stands out as SEN a jumpy prisoner who joins THXs jailbreak. The budget for the picture was originally set at 777777 about half of which appears to have gone toward white paint. As much as the movies themes are dark its a feature bathed in bright light. ""THX 1138"" was the first project for Francis Ford Coppolas American Zoetrope studio and the movie stays mostly underground and close to home. The real showcase is Lucas still-percolating talent which is apparent throughout the film. For a movie that will never in a thousand reissues appeal to the masses (several in the audience walked out of the San Francisco preview screening) the script by Lucas and co-screenwriter Walter Murch brings a lot of humor and inventiveness to the genre. Theres no cantina scene or ""Luke Im your father"" moments but the holographic television stations productivity-happy public address system (""Let us be thankful we have commerce Buy more Buy more now"") and the movies stark prison-with-no-walls are almost as memorable. After Warner Bros. studios famously hated the film and brought in its own editors Lucas restored the scenes to the correct order and added about five minutes. But its hard to tell where. ""THX 1138 The Directors Cut"" doesnt feature the all-consuming visual overhauls of the ""Star Wars"" trilogy special editions. And whatever special effects were added blend in nicely with the clunky green-screen computers and poor-resolution video monitors which Lucas appears to have left firmly in 1971. With science fiction now associated with big budgets and heavy action ""THX 1138"" will probably be even less of a mainstream crowd pleaser than it was three decades ago. But at least this time the movie will be seen as its creators intended - in a directors cut that polishes the artists bleak vision without losing the feeling of great things to come. Advisory This film contains nudity violence and dark adult themes. - Peter Hartlaub The Leopard Drama. Starring Burt Lancaster Claudia Cardinale Alain Delon. Directed by Luchino Visconti. In Italian with English subtitles. (Not rated. 185 minutes. At the Castro).. ""Not many directors have had such a total belief in style"" Martin Scorsese said of Luchino Visconti in ""My Voyage to Italy"" his documentary on Italian cinema. ""He worked through total artifice as a way to the truth."" There is no better example of Viscontis skill on display than the concluding passage of ""The Leopard"" a nearly hourlong ballroom sequence that says everything about the passing of an era and the total reorganization of Italian society through a series of looks expressions and movement that is deep rich and emotional. The original 1963 Italian film was 205 minutes; a 185-minute version the most complete in existence was meticulously restored for its DVD release by the Criterion Collection and the glorious wide-screen 35mm print struck from that restoration opens today at the Castro. Based on a 1958 book by Giuseppe Lampedusa which is still one of the best-selling books in Italian publishing history ""The Leopard"" tells the story of a Sicilian count Prince Don Fabrizio Salina (Burt Lancaster) who realizes his way of life is doomed during the outbreak of revolution in the 1860s that would unite the Italian provinces into one country (the ""Risorgimento"" literally the resurgence) and begins planning for a way for his family to survive. He adopts his nephew Tancredis credo which is ""For things to stay the same everything must change."" Part of that change is marrying off the pragmatic and ambitious Tancredi (Alain Delon) to Angelica (Claudia Cardinale) the beautiful daughter of a local official (Paolo Stoppa) whose newfound wealth and importance is a direct result of the new order. Lancaster was imposed on Visconti by the American co-producer 20th Century Fox. Although he spoke in his own voice in the butchered American English-language version which is about 25 minutes shorter the Italian dubbing in Viscontis version doesnt seem strange. European co-productions at that time often had a mix of international personalities (Delon of course is French) and post-synched dubbing was the norm. Lancaster lends such a charismatic presence and he conveys so much through his expressions that the film doesnt feel compromised and it is one of his best performances. The formal style of ""The Leopard"" is deceiving in that in 1963 with the European New Wave in full force with stylistically adventurous films like ""La Dolce Vita"" ""Jules and Jim"" and ""Woman in the Dunes"" it looked old school. But make no mistake; ""The Leopard"" is just as subversive. Visconti (1906-76) was born into aristocracy - his full name was Count Luchino Visconti di Modrone and he came from one of Europes oldest families. But in his 30s he became a Marxist and until the end of his life was a member of the Communist Party. He was inspired to be a filmmaker when while in Paris he fell into a job as an assistant to Jean Renoir on two films including ""The Lower Depths"" (1936) and his ideology was in full force in one of the key films in the post-World War II Neorealist movement ""La Terra Trema."" But it was with ""Senso"" that Visconti first explored the Risorgimento and began his foray into excessive style through costumes set design and music. ""The Leopard"" is the culmination of that style - and through it he can convey the culture of the aristocracy and feel empathy for it (after all he is of it) yet at the same time realize (through his Marxist beliefs) that change is/was necessary. It is politically insightful without being preachy. The feeling at the end of this masterpiece - a profound meditation on mortality really - is so pitch-perfect and conveys so many complexities at a very simple level that ""The Leopard"" has become one of the greatest of all epics. - G. Allen Johnson Ju-On Horror thriller. Starring Megumi Okina Misaki Ito Yui Ichikawa Misa Uehara and Yuya Ozeki. Directed and written by Takashi Shimizu. (R. 92 minutes. Japanese with English subtitles. At Berkeleys Act One amp; Two and the Rafael Film Center.). If moviegoers are to believe Sam Raimi (he being the director of ""Spider- Man"" and ""Spider-Man 2"") ""Ju-On"" is one of the scariest movies in cinematic history. To quote Raimi ""Ju-On"" is ""the most frightening film Ive ever seen leaving you no time to catch your breath."" Really? Could Raimis praise have anything to do with the fact he has a vested interest in the movies success - that Raimi is the executive producer of a new American version of this Japanese cult film? Both the new and old versions are directed by Takashi Shimizu so maybe Raimi was just being nice to Shimizu when he offered his adulation. Bluntly speaking ""Ju-On"" is anything but frightening. Ridiculous. Unbelievable. Unintentionally funny. It might as well be a parody of a horror film. Heres the story line A young beautiful home-care worker named Rika (Megumi Okina) visits a patients home in suburban Tokyo. The house is disheveled and the patient traumatized and when Rika notices a childs hand pressing against a door she investigates - going upstairs and (against a backdrop of scary music) discovering a black cat that seems to turn into a young boy. This boy (Yuya Ozeki) has white powder all over his face signifying that hes among the living dead. Is the house haunted? Was the boy part of a family that was killed there a few years earlier? Rika is scared but curious. And for the next 90 minutes we see a phalanx of other people - from police officers to a daughter of the patient - also visit the home and also come away puzzled. Or dead. The problem is a curse that takes the form of a dead woman who crawls and hovers and looms large whenever theres a need for a scary transition. One reason perhaps that ""Ju-On"" became such a big hit in Japan The film takes place in isolated corridors and streets often at night. Theres even a series of daytime shots of walkways empty of any people. This feeling of aloneness is unusual in a small country whose capital city has more than 12 million residents. American audiences may not be as intrigued by this aspect of ""Ju-On"" but that doesnt leave much else to recommend.Apparently part of the dead womans curse is making sure her victims freeze up upon sight of her. They dont run away. They dont block her path with chairs. They dont use their cell phones to call the authorities. Its enough to make you scream at the screen. Advisory This film has some disturbing images. - Jonathan Curiel Bulgarian Lovers Comedy-drama. Starring Fernando Guillen Cuervo Dritan Biba. (Not rated. 101 minutes. Spanish with English subtitles. At the Lumiere.). The latest sport for bourgeois middle-aged attorney Daniel (Fernando Guillen Cuervo) and his circle of affluent gay friends is prowling Madrids gay bars in search of impoverished immigrant guys - who are themselves looking for money or someone to ""fix their papers."" ""It was the turn of the millennium"" Daniel tells us in voice-over as he roams a nightclub with a video camera in search of the nights hunk. ""Suddenly there was an invasion of multicolored boys looking for a better life in our country. Looking for someone to help them out of their helplessness."" Daniel strikes gold one night when he gives a light - then dinner then a home - to Kyril (Dritan Biba) a sexually magnetic 23-year-old Bulgarian who proves to be a tiger in the sack. But the hunter gets captured by the game in this sly stylishly cynical dark farce based on Eduardo Mendicuttis novel and directed by gay Spanish director Eloy de la Iglesias making his return to filmmaking after a 15-year absence. Virile Kyril also has a Bulgarian girlfriend and Daniel willingly and somewhat masochistically becomes subsumed by his imported rent boy - his wry asides to the viewer make it clear that he considers being used a reasonable trade-off for passion. (Best line After Daniel proclaims his love by declaring ""Id give my life for you"" Kyril replies ""Id also give your life for me."") De la Iglesias digs into the juicy themes of immigrant survival and the economies of sex relationships and plays in stylish Almodovar mode - with fluid sexuality multiple layers of deceit and plentiful (and spectacular) male nudity. ""Bulgarian Lovers"" is well acted and its Faustian dynamic of mutual exploitation would be absorbing enough but as Kyril draws Daniel into ever shadier situations the film loses its tone and devolves into absurd political farce. Advisory Sexual situations drug use and male frontal nudity. - Joe Brown Most Popular 1 Dear Abby I want to contact mistress from 45 years ago 2 Cops Son of billionaire former supermodel arrested after... 3 Ann Coulter Hammered by Conservatives for Smearing US War... 4 Dear Abby I dont want anyone to know that Ive retired 5 Iceland man says Donald Trumps son left white powder at... 6 Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed 7 Inmate charged in 2015 quadruple slaying in S.F. 8 Police Girl 14 slits teens throat in hope of first kill 9 33 signs youre living in the San Francisco bubble 10 San Francisco ranks surprisingly low on the list of 20 Most...

Resident Evil Apocalypse Movie Review (2004) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/resident-evil-apocalypse-2004,200,residentevilapocalypse8,residentevilapocalypse,rogerebert
"Noisy Evil has game but not much else - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Noisy Evil has game but not much else By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  September 10 2004 If youve wondered what biting into somebodys leg sounds like ""Resident Evil Apocalypse"" is here to tell you it sounds like biting into a big cartoon apple. There are more zombies on the loose in this noisier sequel to the 2002 movie and seemingly few people to eat. But since the film exists only to re-create the experience of watching the ""Resident Evil"" videogames a navigable story and characters are not as prized as firing round after round into hundreds of half-dead extras.Like so many movies with a keypad for a brain ""Resident Evil Apocalypse"" is another exercise in making us feel the irritation associated with having to stand behind some game hack for our turn to play. Our hack for this movie is director Alexander Witt who excels at making sure things blow up on schedule. His grasp of the script which was left behind by the first movies director Paul W.S. Anderson (who decided to make ""Alien vs. Predator"" instead) is minimal.The zombies in the movies Raccoon City -- a digitally engineered metropolis thats part Manhattan part Tokyo with a pinch of Thunderdome -- are humans infected with something called the T-virus. Things are so bad for the human population what with all the raging undead that the heartless Umbrella Corporation maker of the evil T-virus plans to nuke the city -- you know to sanitize it. Just in time to save a few people from destruction is Milla Jovovichs military operative Alice. She was unlucky enough to survive the first movie which required her to shoot up lots of Umbrella scientists who were turned into flesh-eating monsters in a nasty lab accident.Alice bails out a bunch of people we couldnt care less about. Then she and her newfound gang are asked to rescue the daughter of an Umbrella scientist (Jared Harris). The girl is stuck in school and needs to be saved before the skinless dogs from the first movie rip her apart. One of Alices crew is a woman named Valentine (Sienna Guillory) and her skin is so smooth and her face so expressionless she could have been born on a hard drive. And judging from her chest holster and that miniskirt-tank-top-knee-high-boots combo Id say somebodys been raiding Lara Crofts tomb.Eventually we learn theres something ""improved"" about Alice. Shes incredibly agile now and indestructible. Umbrella has more surprises in store for her but none for us unless you count the sequence that has Alice fighting Euro-baddies in a towel. The promised apocalypse never adequately comes. But you might smell a second sequel in the air. Maybe theyll call it ""Resident Evil Atrocity"" as this one should have been.

This time a biogenetically enhanced Alice gets help from two popular ""Resident Evil 2"" and ""3"" characters -- tough-cop-who-looks-like-a-hooker Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) and S.T.A.R.S. leader Carlos Oliveira (Oded Fehr) -- and confronts the hulking over-armed genetic freak Nemesis as well as nasty Lickers and those funky Dobermans from Hell. Plot and narrative? Minimal. Confrontations? Endless. Surprises? None. If only something could reanimate the dead brain cells of scripter Paul W.S. Anderson who leaves the directing to first-time helmer Alexander Witt. Contains nonstop violence obscenity and nudity. Area theaters.

Perhaps the least necessary movie sequel since ""Benji Off the Leash"" ""Resident Evil Apocalypse"" picks up where the surprisingly profitable 2000 original left off telling another tale of T-Virus-infected zombies wreaking havoc in fictional Raccoon City. Calamitously uninspired and borderline incoherent new pic lacks even those fleeting pleasures (namely a sense of humor) that made the first film a passable popcorn attraction. Audiences should be quick to catch on resulting in a B.O. take well below the 100 million worldwide gross of its predecessor. Cliffhanger ending notwithstanding ""Apocalypse"" could spell doom for the future of this Screen Gems franchise. Conceived as a prequel of sorts to the enormously popular videogame series which in turn owes more than a bit to George Romeros ""Living Dead"" trilogy first ""Resident Evil"" pic depicted the outbreak of the corpse-reanimating T-Virus in the underground lab (known as the Hive) of the sinister Umbrella Corp. Trapped inside during the ensuing lockdown a small band of uninfected survivors tried to escape. In the end only two did amnesiac security guard Alice (Milla Jovovich) and Matt (Eric Mabius) who was searching for his missing sister. Just when it seemed as though the worst was over Alice and Matt were abducted by shadowy Umbrella employees amid talk of something called the Nemesis program. (New pic was originally known as ""Resident Evil Nemesis"" until the failure of the bigscreen ""Star Trek"" entry bearing that same subtitle.) At the beginning of ""Apocalypse"" all seems well again in Raccoon City. Then in the interest of figuring out ""what exactly happened down there"" some Umbrella honchos approve the reopening of the Hive which in turn unleashes a new wave of zombie terror on the unsuspecting city above. Interested only in preserving its corporate image Umbrella Corp. seals off Raccoon City allowing its denizens to gradually devour each other. Umbrella does try to evacuate a few ""high-priority extractions"" including paraplegic company scientist Dr. Ashford (Jared Harris) and his teenage daughter Angie (Sophie Vavasseur). But the SUV transporting the girl crashes stranding her amid the zombie infestation. Meanwhile another posse of survivors is forming led once again by Alice who has been infected guinea pig-style by Umbrella Corp. with both the T-Virus and its antivirus. Along for the ride are tough-talking female cop Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory in vidgame-esque tight-fitting top and ultra-miniskirt) the leader of Umbrella Corp.s elite tactical rescue team (Oded Fehr); and the obligatory fast-talking hustler type (Mike Epps). Unable to get help for Angie from Umbrellas nefarious Major Cain (Thomas Kretschmann) Dr. Ashford promises to provide Alice and her group with safe passage out of Raccoon City for the safe return of his daughter. So begins a tiresome game of cat-and-mouse as the rescuers make their way toward the girl while doing battle with the same assortment of baddies introduced in the previous pic. The only major new element is the Nemesis creature itself -- a giant monster that may or may not be a mutated version of the Matt character from the first pic. Otherwise new pic is less an advance on its predecessor than a re-staging. But dramatic energy is dissipated in transposing the setting from the claustrophobic bunker-like environs of the Hive to the spacious city. First-time director Alexander Witt seems at a greater loss than previous helmer Paul W.S. Anderson in staging action sequences. The movie is so underlit and overcut it is frequently impossible to discern whats happening. If this were a videogame one would be compelled to return it to the store for a refund. As before pic racks up some novelty value for its willingness to let its heroines do as much or more of the ass-kicking as its heroes though Guillory doesnt seem to be having nearly as good a time as Jovovich. But the whole enterprise registers as a missed opportunity when one considers the satirical potential of the premise particularly in this moment of Enron and the other corporate scandals -- exactly the sort of sociopolitical subtext Romero has played up in his work and that even this years lackluster ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake tapped into more effectively than this assembly-line offering.
