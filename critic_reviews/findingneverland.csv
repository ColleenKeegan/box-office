Trouble is scurrilous Edwardian minds thought the affair had more to do with Barries interest in Daviess lovely children; a matter Allan Knee and David Magees script alludes too but deems beside the point. The point this film attempts to express is more about transcendence; not only how the childrens imaginations act as Barries artistic muse and help him come to terms with the early death of his beloved older brother but also how the childlike Barrie in providing chaste consolation for the grieving Sylvia dignifies the value of the non-sexual side of caring relationships.Its a difficult trick to pull off not least within the confines of the conventional quality drama and if the film is partially successful it is in no small measure due to overall good performances. Dustin Hoffmans producer Charles Frohman Julie Christie as Sylvias frosty mother and the young Freddie Highmore as the sensitive Peter Davies deserve mention alongside an unhistrionic Winslet as terminally ill Sylvia and Depps beautifully judged innocent. Forsters feel for Edwardian London with its echoes of Topsy-Turvy-esque theatreland can tend to the derivative but he handles well notably in the garden play scenes and the effect-generated fusion of fantasy and reality. But the whole is infused by an awkward decorum; the kind that descends on a gathering dominated by an unmentioned death or transgression.

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

Dont even try to convince me there was. I know what Im talking about I flew there too. So did others. Millions of them. Many are now sad-eyed earthbound grown-ups dragging their briefcases on to the crowded Metro or cursing behind the wheel on I-95. But I daresay many can remember the gravity-defying exhilaration of pure belief. ""Finding Neverland"" starring Johnny Depp is for the ones who remember or want to. J.M. Barrie (a charming Johnny Depp) befriends young Peter Llewelyn Davies (Freddie Highmore) in Marc Forsters ""Finding Neverland.""

Who dreamed up Peter Capn Hook Wendy Tink and the Lost Boys? That would be Scotlands own J.M. Barrie the subject of Marc Forsters quietly enchanting ""Neverland"" whose 1904 staging of the play ""Peter Pan"" introduced flight and fancy to a sedate English stage. Played by Depp James Barrie is a childlike soul a soft-spoken yet charismatic clown whos all but absent from his marriage with Mary Barrie (Radha Mitchell) but whos readily available to four children he meets one sunny day in a London park. His magical ways with them charm the heart of their widowed mother the ailing Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet). Despite hostility from Sylvias magisterial mother Emma (Julie Christie) James becomes an essential family member supervising imaginary games and trying to animate young Peter -- still emotionally withdrawn after the death of his father. These children we rapidly realize will soon become Jamess inspiration for Peter Pan and the Darling family. Jamess Newfoundland dog will also figure in the story. So will Emma whose surrogate figure will be Capn Hook. ""Is he in trouble?"" young Michael asks aloud when Emma sternly asks James to have a private word with her. The real story as many a world-weary adult might tell you is far different. There were five children not four. Barrie was inspired by three families not one. The head of the Davies family was not dead when Barrie met them. And theres no way the 5-foot-1 Barrie resembled Depp handsomest man on the planet. There is also that never-proven intimation of pedophilia on the real Barries part suggested by his obsessive interest in children and an emotionally lackluster almost asexual relationship with his wife. But movies are about emotional truths. And scriptwriter David Magee (adapting Alan Knees play) has taken that crucial time between Barries meeting of various children in the early 1900s and 1904 (when the play opened) and run with it. Flown with it perhaps. How deeply appropriate for the man who conjured such blissful make-believe. ""Finding Neverland"" is the story most people would want to hear a film about the power of imagination in a hostile world. (Theres an unintended chuckle too for Washington audiences that has to do with ""Redskins."") That world includes Emmas withering glances; Sylvias onset of tuberculosis; Peters resistance to fun; Jamess harried producer (Dustin Hoffman) who pressures him to write an instant and successful play; and the stares of those who disapprove of his peculiar relationship with someone elses children. Depp is a charm. He becomes his own subtly compelling Barrie. And his Scottish accent I have to say is more than close enough for Hollywood work. A man-boy who certainly ignores the responsibilities of his own marriage he knows the score when it comes to preserving ones innocence. ""Young boys should never be sent to bed"" he warns Sylvia at one point. ""They always wake up a day older."" Its a super line for the movie an even better one for life.

There is a man for whom niceties matter little much to the consternation of his ambitious wife. Its opening night for his play and hes refusing to meet and greet. Instead he stands backstage obsessing and worrying. The curtain rises. The play flops. So the man does what he does best He retreats into the seductive embrace of his imagination and watches with satisfaction as a sudden drenching rain soaks the sourpusses sitting in the audience. For playwright J.M. Barrie imagination is a most satisfying mistress. It enables him to ignore a strained marriage frustrates his ever-frustrated producer (a prosperous-looking Dustin Hoffman) and eventually results in his career triumph the childrens classic play ""Peter Pan.""

An umbrella becomes the captains hook. Boys bouncing on beds suddenly are catapulted in the air and out the window taking whimsical flight. ""Finding Neverland"" directed by Marc Forster (""Monsters Ball"") is both ""inspired by true events"" and based on a play ""The Man Who Was Peter Pan."" Played by Depp with an air of wonder and a soft Scottish burr Barrie is a case of arrested development He cant seem to connect with his icy babe of a wife (Radha Mitchell) for whom keeping up with the social register is a lifes calling. At dinner they make listless conversation across a long dining room table; at bedtime they say goodnight shutting the doors to their separate quarters. He finds fun in the park making the acquaintance of the Davies family four charming boys and their widowed mother (Winslet). Theyre all quickly charmed by Barries whimsy except for Peter (a wise and skilled performance from 12-year-old Freddie Highmore). Where Barrie is a grown-up who refuses to grow up Peter is a boy grown too old all pinched face and bitter asides. His father abandoned him by dying and hes not going to let misfortune sneak up on him again. And so he stands at the ready waiting for life to deliver another blow. In due course he too is seduced by Barries exuberance and hes soon flying around the house playing with mermaids and Indians and dodging the dangers of Captain Hook. ""Young boys should never be sent to bed"" Barrie says as he watches the boys ricochet through their house in an attempt to avoid bedtime; ""they always wake up a day older."" Soon of course people start to talk; whispers of pedophilia and all sorts of improprieties float around a discomfiting but inevitable reminder of that other man who would be Peter Pan -- Michael Jackson. But Barries love is a chaste one both for Sylvia and for the children. He is the ultimate innocent even when tragedy revisits the Davies family. Even in the movies most emotionally manipulative scenes Depp is always convincing bringing exuberance and tenderness to a portrait of the writer as a lonely man a man who seeks to assuage that loneliness through another mans family while his wife waits at home alone. Still save for the pirates and the ticking crocodile there are no bad guys here just decent folks trying to muddle along as best they can. Barries wife may be a snob but Mitchell convincingly portrays a woman bedeviled by her husbands indifference. ""Finding Neverland"" is a movie thats neither twixt nor tween which is to say its too grown up for children and too childlike for adults. Its amusing to watch Barries greatest love his imagination come to full flower under the inspiration of the Davies boys. But it leans too heavily on the Meaningful Moments trumpeting their arrival and shamelessly playing the audience like a Stradivarius. Youre expected to weep and perhaps you will weep. But if you do its not likely that youll respect yourself in the morning. Finding Neverland (101 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for adult themes and brief profanity.

(AP Photo/ Miramax Films) DatebookDatebookChronicle11/19/2004Advance0422456663 J.M. Barries fairy dust lifts nearly lost Neverland 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Finding Neverland Drama. Starring Johnny Depp Kate Winslet and Radha Mitchell. Directed by Marc Forster. (PG. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Finding Neverland"" ends so beautifully so poignantly and so aptly that theres a big temptation to forget that most of what precedes the ending is tiresome drivel that Johnny Depps performance as ""Peter Pan"" author J. M. Barrie is precious and uninsightful and that almost all of the movies magic derives directly from scenes lifted from Barries play. So what can one say? The movie is one long snooze until the finish leaves half the audience glowing and in tears. One could say the movie builds to its finish but it doesnt really. One could say that its worth the wait but maybe it isnt. Maybe its like a fish-stick dinner followed by a mouthwatering dessert Its by no means awful and yet knowing whats to come whod seek out the experience? Loosely based on true events but not adhering strictly to fact ""Finding Neverland"" is a fanciful re-creation of the circumstances surrounding the creation of Barries masterpiece. One day Barrie strolls in a park and meets a young widow Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet) and her young sons. A friendship ensues. Barrie and the boys start playing together every day and he practically moves into the Davies household. Though married Barrie takes no interest in his own perfectly lovely wife (Radha Mitchell) who goes through the movie looking stunned -- perhaps stunned that she linked her life to such an oddball. But Depp doesnt play Barrie as an oddball or an eccentric in any real way. For an actor known for taking chances Depp turns in an unadventurous performance too protective of Barrie with none of the idiosyncrasies that might have made him laughable or lovable. He doesnt play Barrie as a child- man who can approach children on their own level but rather as a quiet saint teeming with unspoken wisdom -- a wisdom of a kind too elemental and profound to be understood by anyone old enough to shave. If Barrie were presented as a more strange or original personality the endless scenes of him clowning with the kids might have been amusing. As it stands theyre deadly. If Barrie were really this way -- exuding joyless enthusiasm and depthless melancholy while spouting cryptic aphorisms -- the kids would have absolutely detested him. The worst comes when Barrie teaches the kids how to fly a metaphor; that is a kite. Humble suggestion a 10-year ban on kite-flying metaphors in movies. Against such a noodly tepid background Winslets no-nonsense strength is especially appreciated. She has the advantage of playing a woman absorbed in practical considerations but no matter. Another actress would have followed Depp into the quicksand of faux-poetic self-indulgence. But Winslet is direct grounded and heartfelt in a recognizably human way. Dustin Hoffman as Barries producer also steers clear of Depps rhythms though he has trouble deciding whether the producer is British or American. Alas Depp does find a victim in Mitchell who as Barries wife allows herself to be sucked into Depps listless sphere. At one point theres a confrontation between Barrie and his wife a cards-on-the-table conversation in which old scores are settled. But watching Depp and Mitchell act it is like watching the same performance squared. So much is felt so much is thought so much is mumbled but in the end so much is withheld that we get nothing. These are not actors playing characters but acting as advocates for the characters competing for who gets voted most sensitive. Its as dreadful to watch as an entire pingpong game in slow motion. ... And then the ending comes and its great. What saves ""Finding Neverland"" is what saves Barrie for posterity He writes ""Peter Pan."" The last 30 minutes of the film are made up largely of scenes straight out of the Barrie classic and the scenes that arent are nonetheless infused by its openhearted longing its hope in the midst of sorrow. Theres no question that ""Peter Pan"" speaks to some essential and timeless yearning in people and somehow just in time that fairy dust lands all over ""Finding Neverland."" -- Advisory Adult themes (such as sickness and mortality) are explored.

Barrie plays a game with Peter Llewelyn Davis an inspiration for Peter Pan in ""Finding Neverland."" YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Johnny Depp J.M. Barrie Kate Winslet or Create your own Manage alerts | What is this? LOS ANGELES California (CNN) -- ""Finding Neverland"" is a beautifully crafted exploration of the many dimensions of the human heart. The new film about Scottish playwright J.M. Barrie -- and his creation of the beloved character Peter Pan -- is deeply moving without being overly sentimental due in large part to Johnny Depps extraordinary performance in the lead role. Get ready to adjust your tear ducts.The film set in Edwardian London also showcases the terrific range of director Marc Forster whose last film ""Monsters Ball"" earned Halle Berry an Academy Award for Best Actress. His move from that starkly raw film to this magically enchanted -- albeit at times tragic -- movie displays a deep understanding of the language of cinema.Based on Allan Knees stage play ""The Man Who Was Peter Pan"" the screenplay for ""Finding Neverland"" by David Magee is not meant to be a literal translation of the creation of ""Peter Pan."" Instead its a rather fanciful take on Barries real-life relationship with the Llewelyn Davis family and how they planted the seeds for a lasting artistic achievement.In a luminous performance Kate Winslet plays Sylvia Llewelyn Davis a widow with four sons. Barrie battling writers block meets the family one lazy morning in Londons Kensington Gardens. The writer begins to befriend them despite the objections of his unloving and distant wife played by Radha Mitchell and the boys stern grandmother Emma du Maurier performed beautifully by Julie Christie.Touched by the fatherless boys -- Jack George Michael and Peter -- and their beautiful mother Barrie begins to tell them magical tales to pass the time during their outings in the park. Through the playwrights vivid imagination he transforms his St. Bernard dog into a dancing bear sticks into sabers and small hills into pirate ships.Innocence and wonder Barrie develops a relationship with Sylvia Llewelyn Davis (Kate Winslet) and her children.Over time a deep bond develops between Barrie and all the members of the Llewelyn Davis family. Eventually he arrives at the point where he cant imagine his life without them. When tragedy strikes Barrie becomes a true father figure forced to guide them through unimaginable grief.Simultaneously Barries writers block disappears as hes inspired to put pen to paper and create the story of Peter Pan. The childlike innocence of the four boys and their enchantment with his magical games resonates deeply with Barrie and leads him to imagine a world -- Neverland -- where no one ever grows up. Its a place where real tragedy doesnt exist and where that sense of wonderment and joy -- felt only by a child -- is never tarnished.With ""Finding Neverland"" Magee and Forster -- just as Barrie himself did with ""Peter Pan"" -- have created a story aimed squarely at the child within all of us. Mixing reality and fantasy along with scenes from the evolving stage production of Barries play the film transports the audience to a world infused with wonder.As always Depp delivers an astounding performance. He has the uncanny ability to express with just a single glance or gesture an entire encyclopedia of human emotions. Winslet is also exceptional in a delicate and finely tuned performance as the lonely widow nearly overcome with the task of raising four young boys.Breakthrough performanceIn a supporting role Dustin Hoffman is delightful as Barries nervous hand-wringing producer an anxious man who predicts doom and gloom for the playwrights unconventional production about a boy who refuses to grow up. Christie adds an elegant element of understated class and refinement in her role as the overprotective grandmother who is deeply dubious of Barries involvement with her daughter and grandsons.Mitchell who will soon be seen as the title character in Woody Allens upcoming film ""Melinda and Melinda"" also has a nice turn as Barries emotionally unavailable wife.But its 12-year-old Freddie Highmore as Peter -- the primary inspiration for Pan -- who will break your heart. Be warned youll need a tissue or three for the final scene. Depp thought Highmore was so good that hell soon be sharing the screen with the actor again as co-stars in director Tim Burtons film ""Charlie and The Chocolate Factory."" Highmore is playing Charlie; Depp is starring as Willy Wonka.""Finding Neverlands"" blend of magic humor human redemption emotion and unconditional love is a deeply satisfying and potent mix. Indeed as 2004 winds to an end Id rank it as one of the best films of the year.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for 1.99 Review Perfect Man fatally flawed CNN/Money What TVs most popular dads earn Poll Most prefer to watch movies at home Cruise Holmes engaged to marryCNN/Money Security alert issued for 40 million credit cards Bin Laden deputy sends message U.S. House votes to keep U.N. dues Iran poll to go to run-off ALL AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE DC FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY International Edition Languages --------- Arabic German Japanese Korean Turkish CNN TV CNN International Headline News Transcripts Advertise With Us About Us SEARCH The Web CNN.com (c) 2005 Cable News Network LP LLLP.

Finding Neverland Movie Review (2004) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/finding-neverland-2004,200,findingneverland9,findingneverland,rogerebert
"Depp is adept but not flashy in Neverland - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Depp is adept but not flashy in Neverland By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  November 19 2004 A recent story in New York magazine wondered whether Johnny Depp would survive respectability but I always liked to think it was more a question of whether his sudden respectability would survive him. The magazine was right to worry though. Depps typical careening lilt of rock n roll is gone from Finding Neverland"" a movie in which everything is on its best behavior including him.Now to be fair the movie takes place over a few months in the life of the Scottish playwright and novelist J.M. Barrie. It dutifully tells the story of how his career turned around after he met kindly English widow Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet) and her four young sons. And it explains how Barries witnessing the boys ability to jump up and down on their beds perform their own plays and be utterly relentlessly perceptive inspired him to write Peter Pan"" for the stage.Depp coasts through this movie hardly breaking a sweat in his tuxedoes and tweed suits. In making Barrie a lonely fellow with a hole in his soul hes never been classier but Finding Neverland"" is a movie -- a family-friendly Miramax one at that -- thats cruising Oscar voters by using a well-scrubbed Depp like a hood ornament. The drama and juicy bits in Barries biography are airbrushed away. (Ian Holm played Barrie in a less manipulative 4-hour version of this story on British television in 1978.)In his real life which Finding Neverland"" picks up in 1904 London Barrie was scandalized for spending more time with the Llewelyn Davies than with his own wife Mary (Radha Mitchell). This receives a passing mention or two but the movie is not about Barrie or how Peter Pan"" changed his career not really. Its too gushy mushy and blah for the contours of a life. Finding Neverland"" is about the Triumph of the Creative Spirit -- over snooty unsubstantiated gossip over an artistic slump over the endless disapproval of glacial women namely Mary and Sylvias mother Emma du Maurier (Julie Christie). Mitchells performance and her scheming character are so much like Christies (cold cold cold) that its tough to tell which was the true inspiration for Dr. Hook.Instead we get a lot of biopic boilerplate that manages to distill the authors life and Peter Pan"" to a digestible message Believe Mrs. Barrie and Madame du Maurier are shrews until theyre no longer able to resist Barries storytelling powers. Even the doubts of Barries faithful producer (Dustin Hoffman) are extinguished on Peter Pans"" opening night.In scene after scene Barrie challenges the Llewelyn Davies kids to embrace their imaginations. On a kite-flying excursion Michael (Luke Spill) the littlest is told that only if he believes he can run fast enough will he get his kite airborne. Nobody mentions a stiff wind or that the tail might be too long -- except for Peter the second youngest. Played by the rather astonishing Freddie Highmore Peter is the only child whose fatherlessness seems to have created a total character albeit one whose skepticism seems extreme in the same way his grandmothers forbidding nature is extreme. The movie looks better for having won them over.Nonetheless Finding Neverland"" pumps a lot of its thematic gas into Barries relationship with Peter Who were supposed to ask is the adult here? But answering that would mean wed have to see both man and child as people when theyre really just instruments in the films bid to install a lump in your throat.Initially it seemed that director Marc Forster (Monsters Ball"") had found a method to let us inside Barries mind by using cutaways to what hes telling the boys to imagine. A dance with the Llewelyn Davies dog becomes a waltz with a bear at a circus. This strategy is reminiscent of the one Tim Burton used last year in Big Fish"" another runny movie about life deathbeds and the human imagination as an expensive coloring book.Finding Neverland"" is like a Burton movie made by the Merchant-Ivory team which is to say that respectability and mannerliness block out all the enchantments. (This is the sort of movie in which someone is always being asked to leave a room so two people can talk alone.)Good taste runs amok. The movie is careful to offend no one which in a more dramatically told film might not be as irritating. A moviegoers ability to predict who will die and who will thaw should not stop a person from being moved when a character turns up dead.But Finding Neverland"" risks nothing showing Barrie as a lovable avuncular eccentric who blows into the lives of grieving children and brings them joy fun and useable lessons. Its a portrait of the artist as Mary Poppins.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.Finding Neverland1/2 (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

It is suitable for the whole family without being a movie aimed at children. A found gem Freddie Highmore left Joe Prospero and Johnny Depp play in the park in Neverland. Miramax The story is based on the friendship that Peter Pan author J.M. Barrie had with the Llewelyn Davies family but it draws heavily from a play The Man Who Was Peter Pan that focused on imaginary conversations between Barrie and the young Davies boys. Barrie playfully portrayed by Johnny Depp with a spot-on Scottish brogue is a man who lives much of the time in his imagination and spends long days in the park with his beloved dog. Barrie doesnt quite fit in Edwardian London. He has grown increasingly distant from his social-climbing wife (Radha Mitchell) and Depp gives his bewilderment over their estrangement a subtle heartbreaking quality. About the movie Finding Neverland    (out of four) Stars Johnny Depp Kate Winslet Julie Christie Dustin Hoffman Directors Marc Forster Distributor Miramax Pictures Rated PG for mild thematic elements and brief language Opens Friday in select cities While in the park Barrie befriends the four Davies boys and their widowed mother Sylvia played with a charming blend of maternal concern and gentle free-spiritedness by Kate Winslet. The boys become the prototype for Peter and Wendys brothers John and Michael. Even Captain Hook has an antecedent that we see in a clever visual involving the claw-like hand of their disapproving grandmother played by Julie Christie. Barrie entertains the exuberant boys with games and imaginative adventures. They respond with youthful enthusiasm but an underlying sadness and apprehension prevails. Their father recently died and their mother has grown gravely ill. Mindful of the harsh realities of their forced maturation Barrie creates the concept of Neverland a place where boys can go and never have to grow up. The unspoken love between Barrie and Sylvia does not fall into the classic romance category. Barries mother ignored him when he was a boy and his relationship with Winslets warm Sylvia may be a way of coming to terms with his youthful trauma. Both characters remain a bit of an enigma which makes the film intriguing. Finding Neverland is director Marc Forsters follow-up to 2001s Monsters Ball. The two films couldnt be more dissimilar in subject structure and look. His first plunged into the darkest reaches of the soul while the second production inclines toward light and redemption. Both however focus upon revealing emotional truths. Finding Neverland deals with weighty themes such as the power of the imagination the ineffable wonder of childhood the loss of innocence and the nature of creativity. The story is told gently and simply without excess sentimentality. It is a welcome departure from more contrived holiday fare.

Even as AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases force us to spend more time talking about sex or watching it than actually doing it we remain obsessed often in unsavory ways -- and Im not just talking about smut. On the evidence of last weeks election more people are taking an inordinate interest in what gay men and women do in the privacy of their own bedrooms. And only the other day I heard a concerned mother no doubt one of the many such who voted Bush into his second term wax plaintive on NPR about the irresponsibility of sex education in high schools where advice on contraception is afforded equal time with abstinence counseling. What Alfred Kinsey a pioneer of whatever liberty the American libido managed to snatch for itself in the 20th century would think of our carnally benighted new age is not hard to guess. Scientist activist and (once he got the hang of it) swinger extraordinaire Kinsey was a passionate believer in the liberating power of knowledge. I have no doubt hed have judged that concerned mother to be both a spoilsport and a public-health risk accountable in part for the epidemic of STDs and unwanted pregnancies. Had he lived Kinsey would certainly have cheered on the sexual revolution of the 60s an era he arguably helped spawn. But to judge by Bill Condons smart humane new movie about the exhilarating tangle that was Kinseys life and work he was no hippie -- though I suspect that for professional and other reasons he wouldnt be averse to time spent on Internet porn sites given half a chance. Condon who made the superb Gods and Monsters a life of the barely closeted Bride of Frankenstein director James Whale has said he wanted to avoid making a staid biopic of Kinsey and its true that Kinsey is jazzed by stylistic bells and whistles that make the movie great fun to watch. Its framed by reconstructions by turns wickedly funny and ineffably sad of the up-close interviews Kinsey and his gung-ho researchers conducted with solid citizens whores gay barflies and sex maniacs all over America culminating in an entertaining map of the country dotted with voluble talking heads their tongues loosened by Kinseys candid questioning. Mostly though the camera is poignantly turned on Kinsey himself to probe what transformed him from a repressed nerd into the sexual radical he became.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm Still the film is a biopic diligently covering the historical bases now common knowledge from biographies and from T.C. Boyles flawed but readable recent novel The Inner Circle. Condon guides us methodically through Kinseys oppressive childhood with a rigidly puritanical father (judiciously underplayed by John Lithgow); the famous ""marriage course"" at Indiana University to which hundreds of students flocked ravenous for sexual information and confirmation of what they were already doing under wraps; his marriage to Clara McMillen the free-thinking chemistry student who became his partner in all his experiments on and off the curriculum; the establishment of the Institute for Sexual Research where Kinsey collected varieties of human sexual behavior with the same impassioned zeal hed brought as a young zoologist to the study of the gall wasp; his leap to fame with the publication of his vast report on male sexuality; and his recruitment of his research team for after-hours activities that brought out the polysexual in all of them and in some cases ruined their lives. Kinsey is a work of passionate advocacy by an openly homosexual filmmaker but Condon doesnt make the mistake of appropriating Kinsey as a gay icon even though the former prude embraced his homosexual side with gusto once he discovered it and controversially credited a third of Americas male population with homosexual proclivities. Nor is this a hagiography. On the contrary the movies strength lies in its portrayal of a many-sided genius as manipulative as he was charming and persuasive monomaniacal to a fault generous and sweet yet utterly clueless about the emotional havoc he wrought in the name of science and like all crusaders for society with more than a touch of the fanatic about him. According to Condon Kinseys tragedy was that he was his fathers son. His triumph was that he managed to get over it. Most movingly though Kinsey is also a fleshed-out portrait of a highly unusual marriage. The movie is also often very funny as any film would be that featured Tim Curry as a crusader for abstinence and its hard to imagine a less likely-looking pair of sexual adventurers than Kinsey (Liam Neeson) and Clara (Laura Linney). Like Nick Nolte another big lug whod have been just as good in the role Neeson can be bearish cuddly wounded and unwittingly dangerous all at once. Awkward in tweeds bow tie and porcupine hair Neesons Kinsey or Prok as he was affectionately (and otherwise) known to students and colleagues is an ungainly professorial type with no gift for small talk. Condons sporadically stiff screenplay feels appropriate to a man who for all his charisma was so ill-attuned to the social signals of others that he could speechify for hours without noticing their eyes glaze over.  We see Kinsey in early manhood sexually untutored and so hopelessly confused about what to put where in bed that his wedding night is an unmitigated disaster and not only for anatomical reasons. One visit to a doctor and a frank talk between the sheets later the pair are enjoying a rip-roaring sex life and not only with one another. In a way the film belongs less to Kinsey than it does to Clara sensitively rendered by Linney as a woman of such breadth of vision that she can see where her husband cant both the joy of free sex and its terrible costs. For all her luminous beauty Linney is at once the most adventurous and least vain of actresses. I doubt shell be gaining 50 pounds or strapping on a false nose for the sake of an Oscar any time soon but as Clara (Mac to the couples intimates) she does stupendous things with a bit of wrinkle makeup and her own elastic emotional range. Thin brown and freckled mousy Mac is also as it turns out game for almost anything including bedding at least one of her husbands young research associates who are ably played by Peter Scarsgaard Chris ODonnell and a deliciously sleazy Timothy Hutton. Yet its also a deeply hurt Mac who spells out for her clueless husband the emotional toll exacted by his relentless pursuit of the sexual diversity he regards as normal. ""Did you ever stop to think"" she cries to her uncomprehending spouse ""that those social restraints were meant to stop people from hurting each other?"" The dilemmas she poses will be entirely familiar to any 60s graduate who had to listen to a euphoric partner tell them they slept with someone else or several someone elses for the good of their relationship and the cause of free love. Condon doesnt take a position on this. Hes showing us that everything has its price and that it is often precisely those visionary enough to push a whole society forward who also have a tin ear for the suffering they cause to those closest to them. As I write George Bush is crowing over a victory he is said to have won on a platform of moral values. Were he alive today Kinsey would gnash his teeth over the armies of concerned mothers who voted Bush back in (the sad downside of getting out a female vote that went missing by a stunning 22 million in 2000) not to mention the 11 states that elected to ban gay marriage -- surely more an attack on gay lifestyles than a defense of heterosexual marriage. This outcome is a sad reflection on a crucial line in the movie that must surely be a direct quote Kinseys impassioned plea that ""Sexual morality needs to be reformed and science will show the way."" Yet the fact that gay marriage is up for debate at all is to some degree a function of his legacy. At the end of Kinsey a straight-looking middle-aged woman (played by Lynn Redgrave who also gave a hilariously mournful reading of James Whales faithful housekeeper in Gods and Monsters) gives radiant thanks to Kinsey for helping her take a leap that transformed her life. Kinsey died at 62 arguably of a broken heart after the Rockefeller Foundation withdrew his funding and Americas morality police drew the line at his findings that women masturbated had real orgasms and even cheated %0 40 on their husbands. But he never stopped working and his heritage lives on in the intensity of our public quarrels about sex and in the range of ""unnatural practices"" he fought to establish as lying within the definition of what is normal.   IF ALFRED KINSEY DISCOVERED sex and ran with it J.M. Barrie who wrote Peter Pan and is the subject of the new movie Finding Neverland may never have gotten it off the ground. By many accounts the Edwardian Scot famous for writing the play that captured the imaginations of kids the world over and established kiddie lit as a lucrative market had a habit of attaching himself to other families most notably the Llewellyn Davieses a family with five boys whom he met and befriended in Londons Kensington Gardens. Marc Forsters surprisingly wan film (coming from the director of Monsters Ball) adapted by David Magee from a play by Allan Knee strongly suggests that Barrie (Johnny Depp) drew not just on his relationship with the boys for Peter Pan but also that the play was written in the throes of romantic love for their mother Sylvia (Kate Winslet).   Im all for free adaptation and Im willing to believe that just about anyone who has laid eyes on Kate Winslet would fall in love on the spot. But this interpretation seems to be a strategic if distorting avoidance of Barries intense relationship with children -- you dont have to believe as some do that he was a pedophile to say children awoke whatever passed in him for libido -- and the fact that he was always a big kid himself. The movie spans a period of several years in which Barrie trapped in a loveless and probably sexless marriage to a tight-assed social climber (Radha Mitchell) takes up with the Llewellyn Davieses and gestates the play that will make his career. Much buzz is being generated about Depps performance being Oscar-worthy about which I can only say that he does a highly credible Scottish accent. Unfortunately its the wrong one a broad brogue more worthy of a Glasgow shipyard worker than of the effete patrician Barrie. Depp is warmer than Ive ever seen him but his performance is strangely muted and grave for a man who liked nothing better than to frolic with a bunch of kids. Winslet is radiant and earthy as ever even as she sickens unto death. Julie Christie is wonderfully acidic as Sylvias controlling mother and Dustin Hoffman is good for a few laughs as Barries long-suffering producer. But theyre all upstaged by one little boy (Freddie Highmore) who plays the Llewellyn Davieses youngest son and who lets Barrie know in no uncertain terms that not he but Barrie himself is the true inspiration for the boy who never grew up. Its the one moment of truth in a flat timid picture that only gathers steam in its last half-hour and though I dont believe in giving Oscars to little kids -- even the best are usually following very close direction -- Id waive the rule for young Highmore. The final scene in which the sorrowing child his thin little face pinched with grief sits with Barrie on a park bench and buries his face in the playwrights coat transcends its schmaltzy intent and becomes the high point in what is otherwise as Peter Pan might have put it an awfully small adventure.

"Finding Neverland | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; finding-neverland ) Finding Neverland (United Kingdom/United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli If its Disney (or its subsidiary Miramax) it must be ""inspired by true events."" Or maybe it just seems that way. Those words which appear in a caption at the beginning are chose with care (more care than the similar preface to Hidalgo). Finding Neverland uses strands of historical fact to weave a story that is largely fictional. Yes J.M. Barrie did write ""Peter Pan"" and yes many of the characters in the film existed but this is predominantly a soft-ball approach to the inspiration that led Barrie to write his most famous play. For one thing it almost completely ignores sex which was certainly a fundamental element in Barries life. (The issue of pedophilia which has dogged Barries reputation for a century is briefly mentioned then quickly dismissed as if it isnt worth contemplation.) Still even considering the liberties taken with the known record (and I have often said that movies should not be constrained by the same rules that govern history books) the end result is compelling and life-affirming. The story is a nice mixture of drama fantasy romance and tragedy with no hints of some of the ugliness that marred the real J.M. Barries reputation. Barrie (Johnny Depp) is at the nadir of his creative powers having just bombed with his latest play when he encounters Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet) and her four boys Peter (Freddie Highmore) George (Nick Roud) Jack (Joe Prospero) and Michael (Luke Spill). Barrie strikes up a quick friendship with the Davies family and soon is viewed by the boys as a favorite uncle. Suspicious of his new relationship with the children and their mother are Barries wife Mary (Radha Mitchell) and Sylvias mother Mrs. Du Maurier (Julie Christie). This association frees the block on Barries creativity and he begins to develop ""Peter Pan"" which would be his most successful stage production. Finding Neverland contains some stock elements but almost all of them are done well. Theres the platonic relationship between Barrie and Sylvia - something that under different circumstances might have developed into a deeper interaction. Theres the give-and-take between Barrie and the boys (Peter in particular) as they release his creative energy and he gives them lessons in living. And theres the bitchy Mrs. Du Maurier whose intense dislike of Barrie allows her to come as close as the film has to having a villain. She wants the writer out of her daughter and grandchildrens lives. The manner in which director Marc Foster (Monsters Ball) mingles fantasy and reality is a little disappointing. Perhaps a comparison to something like Peter Jacksons Heavenly Creatures is unfair (although Kate Winslets appearance in both makes it a natural contrast) but there are times when the interfacing of England with Neverland is prosaic. Neverland rarely seems otherworldly. The fantasy sequences (which are sometimes just playtime between Barrie and the children ""amped up"" by imagination) are only occasionally imaginative. There are a number of excerpts from ""Peter Pan"" (with Kelly Macdonald in the title role) but the lack of context might cause some confusion for those unfamiliar with the entire story. If it sounds like Im being overly harsh to Finding Neverland I dont mean to be. Its a fine fictionalized bio-pic and it hits all the right buttons. Plus theres enough bitterness in the ending to avoid the happy sense of closure from becoming cloying. Dustin Hoffman as Barries producer Charles Frohman gets his share of laughs with a droll performance. And while Depp isnt nearly as flamboyant as he was in Pirates of the Caribbean he nevertheless brings a lot of energy and a weird accent to his portrayal. Kate Winslet who has suddenly become a rarity at the cinema is solid as usual as Sylvia a character whose complexities are only hinted at. Of the boys the standout is Freddie Highmore who does an excellent job with the difficult part of a boy who is having trouble dealing with grief and its associated guilt. Finding Neverland is best described as a ""safe"" movie. It does what it sets out to do but never attempts anything risky. It is by turns tender humorous and touching but it never attempts anything that would elevate it to the next level. This is solid but unspectacular entertainment and most who see it will leave theaters satisfied although not overwhelmed. Finding Neverland deserves a recommendation because it works on an emotional and to a lesser degree intellectual level.

Barrie came to write ""Peter Pan."" Marc Forsters astutely judged follow-up to ""Monsters Ball"" is the rare modern film that like Hollywood fare of the classic studio era can play well to all age groups. Stellar cast led by Johnny Depp gives Miramax plenty to work with. Quiet emotions run deep in ""Finding Neverland"" an impeccably made and genuinely moving account of how Scottish author J.M. Barrie came to write ""Peter Pan."" Based on people and events that have been maneuvered in a way to evoke the sources of inspiration for one of the enduring classics of the last century Marc Forsters astutely judged follow-up to ""Monsters Ball"" is the rare modern film that like Hollywood fare of the classic studio era can play well to all age groups. It also will reduce many viewers to tears which along with a stellar cast led by Johnny Depp gives Miramax plenty to work with in positioning the picture as a remunerative classy late-year release. With the flop of last Christmas elaborate ""Peter Pan"" not yet forgotten ""Finding Neverland"" offers the public something different. Most importantly there is Depps delicate and inviting portrait of an unusual man a celebrated playwright of the Edwardian era whose own refusal to abandon his childlike instincts allowed him to create a fantasy about a boy who didnt want to grow up. Then theres the rare success of David Magees screenplay based on Allan Knees play ""The Man Who Was Peter Pan"" in making the life of a writer not only interesting but plausible in the connections made between life and work. The key here is Barries chance encounter in Kensington Gardens with Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet) and her four young sons. Fresh off a West End flop in 1903 Barrie is looking for fresh ideas when he meets Sylvia the daughter of artist and author George du Maurier and a recent widow now quite overburdened. Barrie starts playing games with the boys in the park and becomes intensely drawn to Sylvia. The odd woman out in this dynamic is Barries beautiful wife Mary (Radha Mitchell) whose tenuous connection to her husband is soon snapped by his new albeit nonsexual alliance. One of the pics minor flaws is its lack of inquiry into the nature of this marriage; one suspects there is a whole level to Barrie and his relations with women that must remain off-limits for various reasons. Also put out by the growing affection between Barrie and Sylvia is the latters proper mother Emma (Julie Christie) who views the attachment as not only socially incorrect but potentially destructive to all concerned. Still there is no stopping Barrie (who was 44 when he wrote ""Peter Pan"") from pursuing his increasingly elaborate adventures with the boys play that soon incorporates elements of cowboys and Indians and pirate escapades that work their way into his writing in key ways. The film establishes confidence from the outset as it deftly evokes the world of white-tie theatrical openings and a sophisticated artistic class just as it nicely suggests Barries daily routine which involves working from a park bench in the company of his enormous dog. Entirely opposed to contemporary convention most of the dialogue is spoken in hushed confidential tones and this understatement contributes significantly to the slow burn of emotion that gathers in intensity through the films second half. During a summer in the country Sylvia develops a worrisome uncontrollable cough; when her hacking interrupts a garden performance of a play written with Barries encouragement by her son Peter (Freddie Highmore) the latter angrily destroys the little set and rips up his manuscript fearing his only remaining parent may be taken from him. At the theater Barries producer the American impresario Charles Frohman (Dustin Hoffman) frets along with the cast at the sheer oddness of the new play now in rehearsals about animals Indians pirates fairies and flying kids. Movie marketing and publicity types will especially appreciate the key detail in the depiction of the opening night of ""Peter Pan or The Boy Who Wouldnt Grow Up"" which took place Dec. 27 1904. The playwright insisted 25 seats be set aside for his own use and he filled them with children from a nearby orphanage. The kids quick and delighted laughter at the antics of Nana the hulking dog in the plays first scene served to immediately disarm and quell the skepticism of the largely gray crowd and the rest is history. But the pictures real climax comes afterward at a private performance of the play for the benefit of the now seriously ailing Sylvia. Barries devotion to her and her boys along with his manner of revealing Neverland to her is exceptionally touching; many moments of the films final stretch will have audiences welling up and blubbering away. Forsters directorial restraint has much to do with this as do the performances of Depp Winslet and little Highmore. Impeccably groomed and as boyishly handsome as ever Depp takes a cue from the soft lilt of his beautifully rendered Scottish accent to create a gently nuanced portrayal of an artist who at least this once found a way to transform troubled reality into an imaginative work for the ages. Winslet who played Wendy onstage when she was 15 vibrantly brings both resilience and vulnerability to Sylvia a woman whose early gifts in life are rapidly taken away. Christie the epitome of carefree bohemianism in her youth here goes effectively to the opposite extreme to stand for the strictest Victorian attitudes. Mitchell is the picture of a beauty in full flower who cannot be neglected for long. Hoffman spryly underplays the theatrical producer who shrewdly allows instinct to trump logic and Highmore is crucially emotive and heartrending as the boy whose name Barrie took for his fictional creation. Shot entirely in England pic is aces in the craft areas from Gemma Jacksons warmly detailed production design and Alexandra Byrnes resplendent costumes to Roberto Schaefers lustrous lensing and Jan A.P. Kaczmareks unobtrusively supportive score. Only wrong note is struck by a silly Elton John-Bernie Taupin song clumsily pasted over the end credits destroying the hard-won tenderness of pics closing moments.
