"Big is painless if predictable - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Big is painless if predictable By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  January 28 2006 Its an elemental calculus (Men) + (Womens clothing) = Funny. I have no idea why this is so but it seems to be wired into our cultural DNA. Presumably there was a Cro-Magnon comedian 10000 years ago who strapped on a pair of coconuts and the Paleolithic equivalent of a housedress and slayed em around the campfire one night. The genetic express runs from that through Some Like It Hot"" and the Monty Python boys and Tootsie"" right up to Big Mommas House 2"" where it hits the wall and falls over.Well thats a little unkind. This belated sequel to the 2000 comedy that stuck Martin Lawrence in a flowered muumuu and several metric yards of latex padding is completely unnecessary but painless like dentistry performed by mimes. Despite a PG-13 rating its fine for the family crowd -- there are little life lessons broad jokes a minimum of crotch hitting -- while still being lame enough that youll probably want to wait for the DVD.When last we saw LA-based FBI agent Malcolm Turner (Lawrence) he -- oh who cares that was six years ago. All you need to know is that Malcolms wife Sherrie (Nia Long) is eight months pregnant a villainous tech CEO (Mark Moses) is about to unleash a computer virus that would allow terrorists to infiltrate Americas top-secret computer networks and Malcolms ex-partner has just been killed following the lead. And the CEO needs a nanny.Enter Big Momma Malcolms bumptious bewigged alter ego. Big Mommas House 2"" has nothing to do with logic as it waddles pleasantly down a well-worn path. The CEO turns out to be a nice guy workaholic (the real bad guys have him over a barrel) his wife (Emily Procter) an uptight nervous Nellie and the kids (Kat Dennings as the rebellious teenager Chloe Grace Moretz as the insecure tweener twins Preston and Trevor Shores switching off as the hell-raising toddler) neglected and sweet. Their real problem of course is that theyre white. In any case Big Momma heads to the rescue dispensing love and serious back.Except for a bit where the hero/heroine finds him/herself in a ladies locker room of a spa Lawrence keeps the leering under control and one or two honest low-rent laughs sneak out. (Im thinking particularly of the lovelorn Chihuahua and the scene in which Big Momma channels Bo Dereks slo-mo beach run in 10."") In the end though the movies geniality is counterbalanced by its total lack of originality. Big Mommas House 2"" is The Pacifier"" with a big fat transvestite instead of a big bald Marine nothing more nothing less. How long will they keep making this movie? Until you folks stop paying to see it. Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

Comments Big Mommas House 2 Ho-hum sequel to the 2000 hit Big Mommas House with Martin Lawrence returning as the intrepid FBI agent in obese drag. Screenwriter Don Rhymer keeps the potty humor to a minimum though like the first movie this is funny mostly for its brazen disregard of common sense--specifically the idea that elaborate full-body prosthetic makeup could be slapped on in seconds by a cop on the run. John Whitesell (Malibus Most Wanted) directed. PG-13 99 min. By J.R.

And probably the best thing that can be said about Big Mommas House 2 is that it isnt as bad as The Pacifier. Martin Lawrence has at least some experience in comedies (whatever you think of them) and draws one or two laughs out of the films preposterous set-up. This time his ex-FBI agent character Malcolm must go back in the field to tail a suspect. Enter nanny Big Momma Malcolms fat-suited female alter-ego who got him the case and the girl in Big Mommas House. Cue lots of waddling pratfalls and credibility questions. Big Mommas deliberate faux pas occasionally amuse but this pays lip service to plot and morality to the point where the film itself seems quite pointless. If Lawrence makes you laugh youd be better off watching him do stand-up.

Donning the fat suit and wig Lawrences FBI agent becomes the nanny to a trio of kids while engaging in the most rudimentary of revenge plots. More than five years after ""Big Mommas House"" -- which was basically ""Kindergarten Cop"" in drag -- Martin Lawrence goes the Uncle Miltie route again in this wholly uninspired sequel which plays more like ""Mrs. Doubtfire 2."" Donning the fat suit and wig Lawrences FBI agent becomes the nanny to a trio of kids while engaging in the most rudimentary of revenge plots. Probably review-proof for openers pic is so episodic and flat it should be a letdown even to those amused by the original. Consider it a trivia footnote that the first ""House"" party featured Terrence Howard as the bad guy and Paul Giamatti as Lawrences partner. Yet if that stakeout caper actually had some semblance of a dramatic foundation the setup here is ludicrous from the get-go as if the box office tally from its forerunner was reason enough to make the sequel. Lawrences Agent Malcolm Turner has wedded the woman he met in the first film Sherrie (Nia Long) and transferred to a desk job as they await the birth of their child. When one of his mentors is killed however Malcolm fabricates an excuse to go undercover as Big Momma becoming the nanny to a businessman Tom Fuller (""Desperate Housewives "" Mark Moses) suspected in the case. Fuller is pretty much an absentee dad and his wife Leah (""CSI Miamis"" Emily Procter) demands order to the point of absurdity -- one of those overeager moms determined to fast-track her kids to the Ivy League without exhibiting any warmth toward them. So its up to Big Momma to set everyone straight while simultaneously ferreting out a national security threat fending off disapproving FBI superiors and evading detection by his wife who begins to doubt that Malcolms on a business trip. If that sounds busy its amazing how tedious the movie feels perhaps because veteran sitcom director John Whitesell presents it less as a feature than a loosely connected series of scenes divided by musicvideos. As a result even most of the set pieces -- including Lawrence in Big Momma disguise accompanying Leah to a ritzy spa filled with half-naked Victorias Secret models -- play better in 30-second TV ads than in the theater. Given that his energy has to carry the action Lawrence actually seems kind of bored except when Big Momma gets to cut loose on the dance floor to teach one of the moppets to be a cheerleader. As for the rest of the cast its hard to avoid thinking that a lot of talented TV regulars picked up checks during their hiatus periods and little else. As constructed by Whitesell and writer Don Rhymer (who shared credit on the earlier movie) the tone also oscillates between overly broad and cloying as George S. Clintons musical cues work overtime signaling the shifts. The movie even lacks any of the big bathroom gags that provided guilty laughs the first time around. The only funny bits rather involve the Fullers 3-year-old son constantly leaping off things (to splat on the ground below) and the depressed family Chihuahua watching telenovelas. No one confuses comedy sequels with ""Masterpiece Theater"" but ""Big Mommas"" exhibits such a minimal effort made to justify a reprise that the assumption appears to be that cloaking Lawrence in Greg Cannoms suit will alone be ample incentive for audiences to flock back. The producers maintain in the press notes that ensuring the sequel measured up to its predecessor prompted the five-year delay. According to that standard ""Big Momma 3"" could be made at any time -- but theres no need to rush.

Take your pick of movie babysitters the wise and engimatic Nanny McPhee or the slapstick Nanny McPhat. Martin Lawrence does his Bo Derek impression in Big Mommas House 2. 20th Century Fox In Big Mommas House 2 Martin Lawrence reprises his role as an FBI agent who goes undercover as the bodacious Big Momma. In this sequel to 2000s Big Mommas House he takes a job as a nanny for a rich family in the OC in order to spy on the business affairs of the dad. While Lawrence is gathering information his grandmotherly alter ego is helping the kids and advising their absentee parents. About the movie Big Mommas House 2   (out of four) Stars Martin Lawrence Nia Long Mark Moses Emily Procter Director John Whitesell Distributor Universal Pictures Rating PG-13 for some sexual humor and a humorous drug reference Running time 1 hour 40 minutes Opens Friday nationwide Call him Big Momma Poppins. While there are moments of raucous humor theres too much sentimental fluff. The scene in which he wangles the nanny gig after hip-checking more qualified contenders is a funny bit. But seeing Lawrence prance around in cornrows and bathing suit like a plus-size Bo Derek or shaking his booty with a bevy of cheerleaders gets old fast. This tired comedy is likely not the last we will see of Big Momma. The sequel warns ""Keep a look out You never know when Big Momma might be back."" This could be the start of an awful new genre Nannies Gone Wild.

Directed by John Whitesell 99 minutesMartin Lawrence is back in fat-lady drag in this inconsequential sequel for the undemanding moviegoer. His F.B.I. agent character Malcolm Turner poses again as an obese middle-age woman who asks everyone to call her Big Momma this time to go undercover as a nanny. ""Her"" employer is the family of a computer expert (Mark Moses) who has created a worm that could compromise national security. An unconvincing subplot has Malcolms beautiful pregnant wife Sherry (Nia Long from the first movie) convinced that her husband is unfaithful. The films idea of humor includes a lacy womens thong the size of a pillowcase Big Momma in a swimsuit and Bo Derek braids running slow-motion on a beach and a big splash of tequila in Pancho the dogs water bowl. There is some inherent humor in the incongruity of an overweight grandmother type in a floral-print dress behaving like a tough F.B.I. man and Mr. Lawrence makes the most of it. The film is generally good-natured too even as it laments the ineptitude of these pathetic gawky overscheduled white people.""Big Mommas House 2"" is rated PG-13 (Parental guidance suggested). It includes sexual references nasty fistfights and gunfire.ANITA GATES Continue reading the main story Were interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think. Whats Next Loading...

That flimsy plot is the one nod to timeliness in Big Mommas House 2; otherwise this unnecessary but genial comedys yuks are firmly steeped in the ways of Y2K. An adorable Chihuahua that looks like it wandered in from the set of an old Taco Bell commercial gets drunk on tequila. Momma chases a perp along an ocean boardwalk before hopping onto a Segway. And the final scenes in a pale imitation of 2000s already-too-satirized Bring It On take place at a tween cheer competition. What you were expecting originality from a Martin Lawrence sequel? House 2 may never elicit more than mild chuckles but when Momma teaches the Fullers a few lessons about family its heartfelt without being syrupy. And Lawrence -- thundering down the beach in cornrows and a yellow swimsuit -- yet again proves that there is no such thing as an unfunny 10 parody.
