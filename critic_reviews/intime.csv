Justin Timberlake stars as a Dayton working stiff Olivia Wilde as his hottie mom Vincent Kartheiser as one of the worlds oldest (i.e. richest) men and Amanda Seyfried as his closely guarded daughter who rebels with a vengeance. Not surprisingly the action never stops.

In Time takes place in an alternate reality where money has been replaced by a new currency minutes hours months and years of life. Its an intriguing concept and the first act offers plenty of thought-provoking twists on it a world filled with ageless 25 year olds 99-second bargain stores upmarket neighbourhoods that cost a year just to step into and the possibility that a missed bus could result in death if you dont have enough time left to get to the bank.But Niccol fritters it all away with a cookie-cutter chase plot a dull derivative visual style and characters who lack all definition. Justin Timberlake struggles to bring a spark of life to the role of Will Salas the day-at-a-time ghetto punk who hits the temporal jackpot when a suicidal rich kid bequeaths him a century. Upping sticks for swanky New Greenwich playground of the undying elite he falls in with bored heiress Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried) but its not long before the law starts sniffing around and the young lovers decide to go crazy Robin-Hood style.The clever central conceit aside theres nothing new here despite the presence of stars like Timberlake and Seyfried the entire film feels incredibly cheap shot in a series of pseudo-futuristic urban hellscapes which look suspiciously like downtown LA. Attempts at a subtextual link to the current global downturn are largely worthless as we simply have no idea how this complex world - let alone its economy - functions. But Niccols major problem is timing action sequences and dialogue scenes lie flat on the screen while his tendency to play around with pacing means that any tension quickly dissipates. Lifes too short.

Huddlestons remark that they go crazy is very misleading they discuss possibilities for changing the world beyond violence and use time which is the only currency as a weapon. The film is far from perfect; it contains a totally ridiculous robbery in which no security guards or Timekeepers are anywhere in evidence and the camera even pans away helicopter- style to give us an aerial view of a grieving Timberlake the kind of shot thats been parodied so many times its hard to see it without tittering. But the rest of the camerawork is pretty damn good with imaginative use of colours and shadows and good contrasting of the rich and poor areas. Seyfried looks like Ana Karina in Alphaville throughout and the playful puns on time words keep on coming. This is an excellent B movie a tech-noir with heart.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 13 2011MikeFeaturedUnusually I read both the TO and audience reviews before going to see this one and wasnaEUR(tm)t expecting much. I rarely see sci-fi films so have little to compare this one with and have no idea what itaEUR(tm)s similar to. Initially I found the concept of objects having a time value a little strange but after a while you get used to it. I thought the general idea of the story aEUR"" a sci-fi Robin Hood giving time to the poor and needy worked well bearing in mind most of the characters lived under the threat of dying within a day if they hadnaEUR(tm)t bought/traded sufficient time.

Three stars.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 12 2011disappointedFeaturedI agree with the reviwer. It was a waste of an interesting idea. It did look cheap - some scenes just looked like a bunch of extras wandering around some warehouses or something - there was no real sense of place and any urgency that there might have been in relation to time running out was ruined because it was hard to keep track of who had how much time. Amanda Seyfieds wig looked weird - along with her make-up which miraculously remained perfect even though shed slept in it. And yes the acting wasnt great from the two leads (although some of the others were very good). But I suppose it was probably quite difficult for them with such a terrible script. The bit about Timberlakes father trying to give people hope (I think that was the dreadful line) was a low point as was the bit where Cillian Murphy (wasted in this role) is racing against the clock to apprehend the two leads and decides to stop for a chat with them.

I knew I was in trouible when Justin cried over his mother. He needs to stick to comedy shorts or singing. The concept was great. The acting was not. Anybody that rated this a good movie has no clue what a good movie is. This guy did Gattaca which was a good movie. The difference was you had very good actors in it. I would have asked for my money back but that would have meant I had to tell somebody I actually paid for it. DO NOT waste your time on this so called movie. Dont rent it on Netflix either.

By Peter Rainer Film critic October 28 2011 Save for later Saved Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried appear in a scene from the futuristic thriller In Time. Stephen Vaughan/20th Century Fox/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Gallery The top 10 highest-grossing films ""In Time"" starring Justin Timberlake is about a futuristic world in which people stop aging at 25 which is when the clock they were born with on their wrists begins its countdown. In less than a year if you dont figure out a way to buy trade earn or steal more time its lights out. As a result the masses are always in a rush counting down the minutes allotted for even the most mundane tasks. The wealthy who can afford to buy up thousands of years of time luxuriate in their ease. Its a have-and-have-not world that I suppose is meant to correlate with todays massive inequalities.The writer-director Andrew Niccol is best known for writing ""The Truman Show"" another movie that got carried away by doomsday deep-think. The deep-think here is even sillier. Timberlakes Will from the run-down side of town rises up against the monied oligarchy. Along for the ride is Amanda Seyfrieds Sylvia a pouty rich kid who gets to rescue the poor while brandishing none too convincingly a very heavy-looking pistol.The film is beautifully shot in chilly blues and grays by cinematographer Roger Deakins and Los Angeles locales are well chosen for futuristic effect. Most of the time however I found myself glancing at the clock on my own wrist. Grade C (Rated PG-13 for violence some sexualty and partial nudity and strong language.)

"In Time reviewed Andrew Niccols sci-fi thriller with Justin Timberlake Slate Sign In Sign Up Time To Skip In Time New Justin Timberlake Sci-Fi Thriller Falls Flat Time To Skip In Time New Justin Timberlake Sci-Fi Thriller Falls Flat Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Oct. 28 2011 445 PM Everyone ... Talks ... So ... Slowly Justin Timberlake in the weirdly stilted sci-fi thriller In Time. By Dana Stevens Justin Timberlake in In Time Still by Stephen Vaughan (c) 2011 20th-Century Fox Film Corporation. All rights reserved. What follow is an imagined dialogue between the characters in In Time (20th-Century Fox) Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. First character Shall I elucidate our movies high-concept premise about a dystopic future where time is quite literally money? Second character Please do And my rejoinder will further explore the laws of this universe where humans are genetically programmed to live only till age 25. After that everyone stops aging and dies in exactly one year unless they are able to buy borrow or steal themselves more time. Advertisement First character So time in our world is basically like digitized currency with each persons arm bearing a readout of how many days hours minutes and seconds they have left? Second character Thats right. And for some reason every conversation in the future revolves around this fact. Third character (bursting in with a gun) Your money or your life Oh I forgot Your money is your life. That last is a real line of dialogue in Andrew Niccols bizarrely stilted sci-fi thriller In Time a movie so consistently flat-footed with pauses between lines of dialogue so vast that you begin to wonder if the whole thing might be a psychological experiment of some kind. Is Niccol (who wrote and directed the similarly themed genetic-engineering thriller Gattaca) trying to force audiences to experience this futuristic temporal dilemma from the inside by making us excruciatingly aware of the passage ... of ... time? Or has he just made a really dull movie? Advertisement Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) lives in the ghetto with his disturbingly hot mother (Olivia Wilde) eking out a living one day (or more often minute) at a time. When he watches her ""time out"" and expire in his arms Will swears to get revenge on the system that allows rich people to accumulate thousand-year lifespans while the poor drop dead in the prime of their lives. A generous stranger (Matt Bomer) gives Will the gift of 100 years allowing him to cross the border into a fancier ""time zone"" where he runs afoul of a time-hoarding tycoon (Mad Mens Vincent Kartheiser) with a pretty rebellious daughter Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried looking like Anna Karina in long false eyelashes and a bobbed wig). A few chase scenes later Will and Sylvia are Bonnie-and-Clyde-style bank robbers on the lam stealing not bags of cash but rectangular digital thingamabobs in which surplus time is stored. They distribute these freely to the time-starved masses destabilizing the social order. So a specialized cop known as a ""timekeeper"" (Cillian Murphy) is sent out to track the couple down--but will he himself run out of time before he can find them? On the page Niccols premise sounds cerebral and edgy like something out of a Philip K. Dick novel but In Time never takes advantages of the opportunities for political allegory or social critique that its story affords. The action proceeds sluggishly with random bursts of violence (many of them perpetrated by Alex Pettyfer as a snide time-thieving gang leader). And my rendering of the dialogue above is an exaggeration but only a slight one. These people dont do a lot with their preciously guarded lifespans other than compare the rapidly diminishing digits on their wrists and make plays on words involving time. There are a few laugh lines but for the most part they seem unintentional ""Four minutes for a cup of coffee?"" complains Timberlake in one scene. Maybe part of this movies essential flimsiness has to do with the fact that everyone in sight is not just 25 years old but as slim and attractive as if theyd just walked out of an L.A. health-food store. Theres an occasional child here and there but no gray hair no wrinkled foreheads not even any schlumpy clothes--apparently even in the hardscrabble time-ghettos of the future everyone can afford to spend their hard-earned minutes at Diesel. This vision of the future as an extended jeans commercial could have been the starting point for a critique of our cultures fear of aging but we never learn why the invisible powers-that-be first decided to institute this cruel form of time-based capitalism. And though theres a vaguely socialist theme of wealth redistribution running through the film its never clear what the final goal is for the two time bandits in love Are they looking to abolish the time-is-money system altogether or just eke out a few more years for the downtrodden? By the end of this stiff plodding movie I was no longer engaged enough to care. Sometimes its a relief when the clock ticks down to zero.

I suppose I should mention that one of the first things the main character articulates via voice-over is ""It is what it is"" which Ive helpfully included the algebraic formula for lest it come off as too complex A = A This will clue you in as to the sort of film youre dealing with here one that takes your valid question of ""How did all this happen?"" and answers with ""It happened."" Despite this the initial plot points seem to hold promise which makes it all the more tragic that when the grand finale rolls around the jarring lack of logic and ham-fisted attempts at an overarching metaphor eventually doom this project to nothing more than a clumsily executed preach-a-thon. Justin Timberlake is Will Salas pronounced ""Solace"" because naming him ""Fred Goodguy"" felt too on the nose. Will inhabits a world where everyone magically freezes at the age of 25 BUT (and isnt there always a rub to the ""freezing in time"" method?) you also only have a year to live from that point on your clock starts when you are frozen. Menial labor gets you more time but its tough to keep up with the rent buy coffee and live the good life when you generally have less than 24 hours left on your ticker both heart and clock because when your time ""runs out"" an electric shock is sent to your heart and poof you are dead. Money has been replaced by time units; rich people simply have more time. It costs time to travel from city to city (or district to district as In Time refers to them) which has the natural effect of limiting inter-district travel. So the poor (or folks running out of time) tend to be cordoned off from the rich (guys and girls rocking 100 years left to live). Your remaining time is displayed on your arm so that everyone in the audience can watch it count down. Time transfers between parties occur when two peoples arms touch in a certain way. The rich are immortal. The poor are living SECOND TO SECOND emphasis added by the film itself. All of this is well and good. Olivia Wilde is Wills (Justin Timberlake) momma only she too is frozen at 25 years and fully attractive finally fulfilling the promise of Hollywood that wed no longer have to look at anyone who wasnt a 9 or a 10 on the hot meter and all in service of the plot no less. As Salas wakes up to open the film his clock is running and he has less than a day to live. This is everyones existence in the ghetto people die all the time prices keep on going up and no one can quite figure out why everything is so terrible. Its like the lyrics from that song by The National ""Bloodbuzz Ohio"" I still owe money to the money to the money I owe The floors are falling out from everybody I know. You work to live with no hope of upward social mobility. But again were not at the troublesome parts just yet and the first 30 minutes do contain some semblance of a working narrative. The framework of one at least. Then Wills district is visited by a tall handsome stranger who is carrying 100 years on his arm. 100 YEARS With that kind of time you could well keep on living This stranger is immediately accosted by time thugs but the dashing and debonair Will bails him out. Now its just Will and the suicidal ""100 YEARS"" guy alone in an abandoned warehouse which seems to be the primary architecture of the city. Flash-cut to what can only be deemed as ""one of the most manipulative and pointless scenes of the year"" wherein Wills mom is RUNNING OUT OF TIME. Can Will reach her IN TIME? Is Justin Timberlake poised to take over the ""guy who runs fast on-screen"" title from Tom Cruise? And who installs the little timers on each persons arm when they are born? All these questions and more will be sort of answered Boom flash-cut to Will deciding hes had enough of the ghetto. He decides to leave meet a rich girl and either live the good life or overthrow the entire system. Its unclear which one hes actually attempting as he firstly dresses very nicely and buys himself a great car not exactly the stuff of warrior poets. Amanda Seyfried is that rich heiress -- her dad is sitting on eons or whatever new slang people have invented for having a lot of something valuable as money no longer exists as a concept. Some poker is played (Will is awesome at poker yall) and a dance is had between the poor kid who grew up on the wrong side of the tracks and the well-off vixen who is looking for a little excitement in her life. While in Richy Richyville (the film calls it New Greenwich) Will begins to gain some clarity about how some people have all the time in the world while others are wasting away every second. The reason according to the film is that ""Many must die so that some may live forever."" Id encourage you to try to attempt to unpack that statement as many times as I did over the course of the nearly two hours I watched this one for. At this point Id like to treat In Time as a hostile witness and question it thusly LL Why must many die so that a few may live forever? IT Because we said so. LL But ... it doesnt really seem fair does it? IT No it doesnt. LL Well why do the people about to die just take it? IT Because thats what the script tells them to do. LL OK sure but doesnt this just set up sort of a half-baked Robin Hood scenario? IT Ummmm ... yeah I guess a little. But weve got Justin Timberlake in this one. You love him on SNL right? LL I do but please let me ask the questions here. I guess I just dont get why everything is so one-note. Your bad guys just hoard time because ""the poor people wouldnt know what to do with it"" and the poor people just take it because they dont seem to have any awareness of the world around them. Wouldnt people with seconds to live try and rebel against the system? IT Yeah but its a metaphor do you get it? Were saying that in this case time is money. As in why are there these rich people in the world while all these other people are poor? LL OK Ill admit thats an issue but Im not sure you begin to scrape the surface of why things are the way the they are.  I mean you dont tackle education drugs taxes banks short-term quarterly business practices... IT Well no we mostly have Justin Timberlake running around. We felt like that was our trump card. LL The prosecution rests. As such the general theme of In Time has some merit but the execution comes off as a fifth graders first poem ... which hes cleverly written into the shape of a question mark. In Time is the kid who has just read Grapes of Wrath and figures out that poverty is bad. But the ""why"" of the situation why some people less fortunate why a society would turn to this sort of caste system why there would be limited ""time"" to go around isnt ever considered. Without that ""why"" firmly in place youve just got a bunch of people running around making expository speeches wasting everyones time.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 28 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Wednesday Mar. 27 2013 1240PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Country USA Language English Movies that are heavy on premise tend to be light everywhere else and In Time is no exception. Really its all premise but give the writer credit His conceit is sufficiently clever to hook us instantly and keep our interest high while we wait for the plot to meaningfully engage. And wait. And wait. Along the way there are definitely some pleasing distractions just not enough to obscure the growing realization that a much better picture could have been made and wasnt. Many films never have a chance but this one did - its an opportunity wasted. Movies In Time The official trailer Still the sci-fi idea is ingeniously simple. It posits a human future where time is literally money and where at 25 the aging process stops but an actual clock begins. At that juncture everyone receives at minimum a further years worth of time credit with the digital record encoded on their forearm in neon green like an ongoing bank statement. Subsequently time can be earned and time must be spent on food shelter clothing and any affordable extras. Fair enough except that the downside of falling into the red is rather severe. Spend more than you earn and poof you timeout - as in die leaving nothing but a youthful corpse.Well the potential of that premise is obvious as is the visual consequence Since regardless of their true age no one looks older than 25 it makes for a very attractive cast. Grandfathers grandsons mothers daughters theyre all hotties and hunks. Among them is Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) a workaday guy who like the rest of the oppressed in the ghetto of Dayton lives hour by hour. Occasionally his digital readout winds alarmingly down to mere minutes but his factory wages can be depended on to up his account to a relatively safe half-day or so. His mom gorgeous yet a bit of a spendthrift isnt so lucky - watch her lose a frantic race against time.Okay now comes the unfortunately skimpy plot. A suicidal stranger bequeaths Will a windfall 100 years on the clock and he quickly sets out to see how the other half lives in the rich part of town. There Dads are ""worth eons"" and daughters like Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried) are said to ""come from time"" - at 25 she inherited centuries of the stuff. In truth theyve got an overabundance and fearful only of death by accidental circumstance live a dull and risk-averse existence. The ocean may lie at their doorstep but the affluent are too afraid to swim in it. Nevertheless they keep escalating the cost of living in order to cull the poor. Their mantra could double as a terrorists wall plaque ""For a few to be immortal many must die.""Admittedly all this makes for a neat way to dramatize the chasm between the haves and the have-nots the one with their bored leisure the other in a carpe diem frenzy. But again writer-director Andrew Niccol (whose script for The Truman Show was another premise-heavy effort) fails to take advantage. Instead once Will and Sylvia have hooked up as the proverbial star-crossed lovers he does little more than whittle down the narrative to an extended chase flick. Extended because the pair are on the lam from two separate threats - the law in the punctilious form of Leon the ""Timekeeper"" (Cillian Murphy) and an outlaw in the nasty shape of Fortis the hoodlum (Alex Pettyfer).They chase on foot they chase in cars they chase over rooftops but the action unlike the premise is thoroughly mundane. So is our stars metamorphosis into Bonnie and Clyde or for the more contemporary-minded into a two-person Occupy movement intent on robbing time banks and redistributing the wealth. Although its hardly an actors film Timberlake is always competent but Seyfried struggles with this gun-toting transition and settles for hiding behind a Louise Brooks bob that accentuates her bug-eyed stare - she looks like a Kewpie doll toting G.I. Joes bazooka.Happily there are some laughs en route. More happily yet a few of them are even intentional. Like when a Dayton hooker shouts to prospective clients ""Ill give you 10 minutes for an hour."" Actually as a ratio of pleasure gained to time invested thats about the same deal on offer here.

"In Time review Thoughtful sci-fi thriller |       NJ.com comments In Time review Thoughtful sci-fi thriller Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on October 28 2011 at 718 AM updated October 28 2011 at 731 AM View/Post Comments Stephen VaughanJustin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried star in ""In Time."" Time is money. That cliche gets a solid working over in ""In Time"" a sci-fi fantasy in which human beings have been genetically engineered to have a life span of 25 years. That is unless they buy -- or borrow or steal -- a little more. A days work on the assembly line? That might earn you another 48 hours. A bus ride? That might cost you 60 minutes. Its a system engineered to keep the population under control the majority in debt and a few ""time billionaires"" in comfort. Until one man -- whos managed to stay 25 for three years -- decides to fight back. Its a provocative idea with roots in ""Logans Run"" (and Harlan Ellisons busy lawyers say in a short story he wrote many decades ago). But it also bears the singular mark of filmmaker Andrew Niccol. He wrote ""The Truman Show"" and wrote and directed ""S1m0ne"" and ""Gattaca""; all were slightly futuristic fables touching on issues of class exploitation and the cost of human perfection. But how did this particular future happen and how is it that no matter how many extra years you buy you never look older than 25? (The films first wonderful/awful title was ""Im.mortal."") Unfortunately ""In Time"" doesnt really care. Its science fiction without the science set in a future where bioengineering is eons ahead but people still drive convertibles use sidewalk pay phones and work in smokestack factories. Niccols lack of interest in grounding his story in any kind of reality is a problem and can leave viewers unmoored. (Really just a few lines of exposition would have helped.) But if facts are in short supply the concepts are almost excessively abundant. Like the way people lend each other a couple of hours until payday or live in segregated cities called ""time zones."" Or the fact that a mans mother wife and daughter can all appear to be the same synthetically frozen age. (Honestly its like the Planet of the Kardashians.) Two of the people behind those pretty faces by the way are Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried -- and unfortunately theyre a bit of a soft spot in the movie too. Although hes supposed to be a ghetto striver Timberlake never demonstrates any real grit. Nor does Seyfried -- an heiress he half-seduces half-kidnaps -- ever seem like anything more than a little girl in a pageboy wig and pretty frock. Theres no urgency to these two even with the clock ticking down. But there are so many other interesting things going on around them. A rigged trade in real ""futures"" where the price is carefully fixed. A swaggering police force of ""clock watchers."" A charitable mission that gives out ... not bowls of soup but a few extra hours. Theyre great ideas and you wish Niccol had thought them through a little more -- or at least rooted them in a more believable universe. But they are still provocative giving rise to not only some amusing wordplay but a fairly pointed critique of power. A both flawed and fascinating movie give it this at the very least Even at its most far-fetched or thinly plotted you never feel that ""In Time"" is wasting a second of yours. Ratings note The film contains strong language alcohol abuse and violence. In Time (PG-13) Fox (104 min.) Directed by Andrew Niccol. With Justin Timberlake Amanda Seyfried. Now playing in New Jersey.

"In Time | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; in-time ) In Time (United States 2011) October 28 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Andrew Niccol is fascinated by the impact of futuristic technologies on society. His gripping feature debut 1997s Gattaca explored a civilization in which genetic tinkering rendered natural reproduction obsolete. With In Time he is again looking to the future and wondering where another technological breakthrough might take the human race. And while his conclusions arent as compelling as in Gattaca following the path that leads to them is not without its occasional pleasures small though they may be. The problem with In Time to the extent that it is a problem is that an intriguing premise turns into window dressing for a somewhat routine Bonnie amp; Clyde-meets-Robin Hood action thriller with car chases heists and gunplay. Take away the science fiction element and this is a routine story about lovers on the run robbing banks and distributing their ill-gotten gains to legions of the poor. In the end this concept might work better as a weekly TV series than as a stand-alone movie. 109 minutes isnt sufficient time to delve into the inner workings of this society and that aspect is what gives In Time an injection of originality. Its a little like Michael Bays The Island in the way the narrative fails to live up to the promise of its back story. The setting is indeterminate. It might be the future although judging from clues in the story it would have to be at least a century beyond today and theres little evidence to support a 22nd century milieu. More likely its in an alternate reality a parallel universe that has evolved similarly yet differently from ours. In this world time literally is money. People live and age normally until theyre 25 years old. Then the aging process freezes and they have one more year before they die. A greenish digital clock on their forearm informs them (and everyone else) how long they have until death. Those final 365 days are a commodity. Time can be bought. sold traded and stolen by the clasp of hands. One hour might buy ten minutes with a hooker. Rent might cost several days. Wages are paid in hours and minutes. For the working class its a constant struggle to keep the clock from hitting zero. For the rich with hundreds or thousands of years in the bank life moves in slow motion - forever young and nearly immortal. The class differences are extreme. Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) shares living quarters with his mother Rachel (Olivia Wilde). They look about the same age but Rachel is 50 and Will is 28. Both live day-to-day and when Rachel underestimates bus fare and cant reach Will in time to get a ""recharge"" on her time her clock expires. Meanwhile Will rescues a wealthy stranger from a robbery. The mysterious man has more than a century left but claims he is tired of the monotony of existence and gives the rest of his time to Will. Coupled with his mothers death this propels Will on a journey that takes him into the ""zone"" where the high rollers live. After a successful trip to a casino he is invited to a party at the house of one of the worlds wealthiest men Philippe Weis (Vincent Kartheiser). When a Timekeeper (Cillian Murphy) corners him with an accusation of murder and theft Will takes Weis daughter Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried) hostage and goes on the run. She quickly turns from captive to accomplice and the two go on a crime spree stealing time from banks owned by Philippe and distributing it to the undertrodden. In Time is allegorical in a way that even the most literal viewer could not miss. Still when viewed on a concrete level the concept of people using time as currency opens up some fascinating possibilities especially when one considers that the government is complicit with the wealthy in keeping the poor so close to death that they are too busy scraping by to do anything rash. The ""futuristic"" landscape in which this transpires doesnt look all that different from today except that the cop cars bear a passing resemblance to KITT from TVs Knight Rider (although they dont talk). Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried capable actors with potentially strong screen presences are criminally underused. They make a cute couple but arent given much more to do than play a generic action hero and his equally generic love interest. They run they shoot they kiss they play strip poker (of the PG-13 variety) and they run some more. The more In Time devolves into formulaic action the less interesting it is. The film is more engaging and inventive during its first half than during its second and the conclusion is muddled and rushed as time constraints force it to end before the audiences patience reaches zero. Niccol has done better work. Gattaca offers a glimpse of how he can spin science fiction concepts into a complex web and Lord of War is an underrated action film with a satirical bite. Here although the skeleton is overly familiar at least he dresses it uniquely. Trying doesnt mean succeeding but at least the effort is there. And plot holes aside (and there are a lot of them) In Time slips by quickly enough. Still those with 109 minutes available might want to consider spending it elsewhere.

And thats the problem Unable to wink at the daftness of his own screenplay -- and perhaps inject some screwball fizz into the proceedings -- Niccol keeps his face straight and his characters weighed down by Important Themes like social injustice and the meaning of life. Its a wonder their feet ever leave the ground. Set in an unspecified future where people are genetically programmed to time out at the age of 25 the film echoes Michael Andersons 1976 hoot Logans Run whose characters were catapulted into the sky at 30 unless they did a runner. But while Anderson never lost sight of his films primary pleasures -- miniskirts monorails and a lithe Jenny Agutter -- Niccol refuses to lighten up. In his us-versus-them dystopia time can only be traded earned or stolen so the wealthy live forever while the rest of us survive on a minimum wage of 24 hours. Credits and debits are transmitted by means of a glowing green bar code on your forearm and since a bus ride can set you back 2 hours of your life (and a car around 20 years) the poor do a lot of walking. Enter Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) a factory worker who lives with his 50-year-old mom (played by 27-year-old Olivia Wilde creepy) and survives one day at a time. Then two things happen Moms time runs out -- literally; shes sprinting towards a top-up when she keels over -- and a wealthy suicide bequeaths Will his remaining century. Newly flush with future possibilities Will heads to the cool zip code where the rich hang out in casinos flanked by armies of bodyguards. There he hooks up with Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried) a stringy heiress whose daddy (Mad Mens Vincent Kartheiser) has amassed millennia by lending minutes to the less fortunate. Given the inherent intrigue of this so-called ""Darwinian capitalism"" -- one can easily imagine spending decades paying off a Lamborghini -- its astonishing how dreary this all is. Even the Minutemen a wandering cadre of time bandits are so prettily effete they would have been kicked out of Alexs gang of droogs in A Clockwork Orange. And poor Cillian Murphy playing a cop-like character known as a Timekeeper who suspects Will of murder is given little to do but drive. And collect his per diem. More of an outline than a real narrative In Time buries its more thoughtful notions (we dont normally think of debts as being repaid in units of time but they inevitably are) beneath endless car chases and repetitive confrontations. As Will and Sylvia embark on a Bonnie and Clyde spree to drain daddys banks and give his fortune to the needy cinematographer Roger Deakins strives fruitlessly to enrich the flat Los Angeles locations. Offering neither historical context nor any broader explanation for the storys crueler conceits -- how much therapy will Sylvia need to process the fact that her mother and grandmother look as young as she does? -- the script offers only a single nod to levity All of its characters share names with famous brands of watches. Even so the film might have earned a grudging pass had Seyfried and Timberlake possessed one iota of chemistry. Instead Seyfried whose enormous wig and abbreviated wardrobe transform her into a goggle-eyed Bratz doll seems as unappealing to her costar as she is to us. Wobbling ridiculously on six-inch heels throughout -- despite making several pit stops to change clothes and draw breath Sylvia inexplicably never grabs a pair of sneakers -- this usually appealing actress is dragged through the film like so much luggage. ""For a few to be immortal many must die"" mutters Wills benefactor before leaping from a bridge and so it is with movies. But Niccol whose excellent 1997 film Gattaca revealed a similar obsession with human genetics is an above-average filmmaker who may simply lack the daredevil recklessness a project like this requires.

The distribution of wealth is about as lopsided as it is today with the richest having at least a century remaining and the poorest surviving minute to minute. Each individuals value is imprinted on the forearm as a clock a string of 13 neon-green digits that suggests a cross between a concentration camp tattoo and a rave glow stick.A child of the ghetto Will (Justin Timberlake) wrongly accused in a prosperous mans death sees his mother (Olivia Wilde) die--""time out""--in his arms and then vows to destroy the grossly inequitable system. Hearing Timberlake refer to Wilde an actress three years his junior as ""Mom"" is one of the films more perverse and savvy touches a wry comment on the demands made of women especially those trying to stay employable in Hollywood to stay eternally young. ""These are confusing times Is she my daughter my sister my mother or my wife?"" Philippe Weis (Vincent Kartheiser) a tycoon worth eons says to Will at a casino table referring to the Anna Karina look-alike by his side. The sleekly bobbed beauty is in fact Philippes child Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried) whom Will kidnaps and who needs little convincing to join his mission to redistribute the hours.A pleasing often rousing movie for the 99 percent In Time is not without flaws. The jokiness of substituting ""time"" for ""money""--""You must come from time"" Philippe says to Will--wears thin after its millionth iteration. One pursuer too many after Will including a rough British dandy whose henchmen look like theyre about to audition for Fosse threatens to demand too many of our minutes. But Timberlake and Seyfried make a foxy well-matched duo He proves as he did in Richard Kellys Southland Tales his agility in dystopic thrillers and she demonstrates that her alarming Margaret Keane peepers serve her better as a class insurrectionist than as the dewy ingenue in roles past. (Their felicitous pairing also helps eradicate memories of the botched Timberlake-Mila Kunis match-up in Friends With Benefits). It seems that Niccol also had Marx in mind when casting his leads ""from each according to his ability.""

And not the good parts.Written and directed by Andrew Niccol who wrote and directed the sublime The Truman Show in 1998 Time begins with a chilling proposition What if you had to spend minutes or hours or perhaps days of your life the way you spend money?PHOTOS This week at the moviesThats the exchange in this world Time literally is money. You are genetically programmed to stop aging at 25. If youre rich enough you can purchase and add time to your life like a calling card making you immortal. The poor Time tells us usually die within a year.The beginning is as chilling as 2006s Children of Men the sci-fi classic about a barren world and Niccol does a wonderful job of establishing Timekeepers cops who enforce countdowns and Minutemen thugs who rob you of precious minutes leaving victims to keel over.About the movieIn Time   1/2 out of fourStars Justin Timberlake Cillian Murphy Amanda Seyfried Olivia Wilde Director Andrew NiccolDistributor 20th Century FoxRatingPG-13 for violence some sexuality partial nudity and brief strong language Running time 1 hour 49 minutesOpens Friday nationwideBut In Time cant manage the clock. Niccol inserts Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) a ghetto kid still struggling with the death of his misunderstood father. Timberlake normally a treat because of his self-deprecating humor is left little to do but look stern and take hostages.Speaking of which. About halfway through the movie Salas decides he needs one (Amanda Seyfried) to continue the point his dad was making. In Time comes almost off the rails at this point and turns into a standard romance-turned-chase film one that telegraphs its ending.And there are some gaping technological holes. The film opens with Will who comes upon a fortune -- a century of life -- and rushes to save mother Rachel (Olivia Wilde). But apparently the future does not involve cellphones because the two make no attempt to change their plan to meet each other on public transit five minutes before shes supposed to expire.Its not enough to fully undo In Time whose themes can be as creepy as those in 1997s Gattaca which Niccol also wrote and directed.The parallels of how we spend time and money are stark. The films ordinary exchanges -- a minute of your life for a phone call one hour for 10 minutes with a prostitute -- are everyday and chilling.So why freight it with cops and robbers and stilted romance? For a film about the preciousness of every second Time still yanks away minutes moviegoers may wish they could get back. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

(AP Photo/20th Century Fox Stephen Vaughan) 20th Century Fox Amanda Seyfried and Justin Timberlake in ""In Time"" (20th Century Fox) Watching Justin Timberlake make us laugh in ""Bad Teacher"" and acting admirably in ""The Social Network"" and ""Friends With Benefits"" makes it easy to think the singer might do well as an action star.But ""In Time"" isnt the vehicle to turn Timberlake into James Bond.Sure the likable Timberlake dashes across rooftops and darts about in a fancy car but it takes more than a lot of motion to make an action character worth caring about. See this summers ""The Green Hornet"" or ""Green Lantern"" for examples. After a nifty setup ""In Time"" mostly fails to deliver as it gets lamer by the minute.Its the near future and your money is no good. Money is replaced by time which is deducted from ones lifeline. A cup of coffee will cost you four minutes a luxury hotel suite is two months and a date with a hooker will take away 10 minutes from your life.Making time even more precious is the fact everyone lives only until theyre 25 and theyre constantly reminded of this by an illuminated countdown ticker on their forearms. However people can buy steal and kill for time to live past those 25 years and people remain how they looked at 25 no matter how many decades they live past that. Thats why Olivia Wilde can play Timberlakes mother looking like Olivia Wilde.Keeping up? This is just the initial setup. Director Andrew Niccols movie demands a lot of explanation -- too much.Timberlakes Will Salas meets Henry (Matt Bomer) at a bar. Henry is tired of living and kills himself but not before transferring his significant remaining time to Will. Will becomes accused of killing Henry and of stealing time an equally serious offense. A rogue police unit called the Timekeepers led by Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy) pursues him as does a mob called the Minutemen.Will finds love interest Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried) and the two begin stealing time from financial institutions and giving it to the poor folks who have little time left all while dodging the bad guys. Its all a little ho-hum never exceeding a second beyond near-serviceable.""I didnt start the clock. I cant turn it back"" a character says.

Photo 20th Century Fox Licensing/Merch Amanda Seyfried as a red-haired heiress catches Justin Timberlakes eye in ""In Time."" (20th Century Fox Licensing/Merch) Bad movies dont get much more fascinating or culturally relevant than ""In Time"" a dystopian allegory with much on its mind and all of it wrong. Bonus It could have been made especially to lure the Occupy Wall Street crowd away to the movies long enough to allow the patchouli and organic bean curd to be hosed off their tents. This futuristic thriller -- ""Logans Run"" meets ""All the Presidents Men"" starring Patty Hearst written as a brainless rejoinder to Joe the Plumber -- strikes me as kindergarten Karl Marx but then what was Karl but a 5-year-old with an expansive vocabulary? It took him 600 pages to say You have more stuff than me. Gimme some. Justin Timberlake is likable enough as a working-class dude from the ghetto named (I love this part) ""Dayton"" though it looks exactly like LA. Time is money When you hit 25 you stop getting older but your clock also starts counting down from 365 days. You can give time to others or add to it by earning. If you hit zero you die. So you work to earn more time but hyperinflation (coffee costs four minutes today though it was three minutes yesterday) means ordinary folk can never get ahead -- they rarely have more than 24 hours on the clock. PHOTOS MUSICIANS IN MOVIES Everyones numbers are visible as countdown meters shown digitally on their forearms to create a parallel with Holocaust victims that is just as spurious as everything else here. The plutocrats who live in (no points for imagination here fellas) ""New Greenwich"" have hundreds or even thousands of years saved up. Naturally Will (Timberlake) will play Robin Hood to even things out. This is an economics thriller that flunks on both macro and micro levels. Will and a rich guys daughter (Amanda Seyfried) he kidnaps for ransom crash a car head-first off a 100-foot overpass into solid concrete only to walk away without even taking an aspirin. And in forearm-wrestling matches (whoever keeps his arm on top sucks time away from the loser) Wills strategy is simply to wait for the other guy to glance down at Wills arm. This distraction somehow instantly makes Will stronger so he wins every time so ... why is he always broke? When the movie isnt delivering labored time-related wordplay (""Follow the time"" instead of the money) and ridiculous chases its spouting ""Das Kapital"" bromides. The New Greenwichians are successful financiers ergo they must have cheated. ""Is it stealing if its already stolen?"" asks Seyfried who goes all Patty Hearst as the pair of them start robbing banks. (Too bad the title ""Time Bandits"" was already taken.) Chunks of time (which look like Atari video-game cartridges from 1978 that have been dipped in aluminum) sit barely guarded in vaults that can be breached simply by driving a truck into them. The movie (written and directed by Andrew Niccol who wrote ""The Truman Show"") assumes that behind every great fortune lies a great crime yet the most massive injustice we see is when a time cop played by Cillian Murphy convicts and punishes Will for time theft with no evidence. In fact Will has come by his time-stash legitimately yet the cop seizes almost all of Wills time on the spot without trial. The movie thinks its about abuse of capitalism but its more about abuse of authority and of logic. The allegory nullifies itself in inviting comparison to reality. Life is more egalitarian than it is in this movie because while rich people may have more toys their wealth doesnt buy them the most precious resource. Warren Buffett wont outlive his secretary by centuries. At the end ""In Time"" thinks its being very up-to-date when it suggests a major stimulus/redistribution program would make the workers of the world rise up against private industry. This future looks awfully passe The stimulus didnt work out. Neither did 1917 Russia.

Starring Amanda Seyfried Justin Timberlake Alex Pettyfer Cillian Murphy Olivia Wilde Elena Satine Ethan Peck Matthew Bomer Vincent Kartheiser Director Andrew Niccol Running time 149 Release Opened Oct 28 2011  Editorial Review Where every second countsBy Michael OSullivanFriday Oct 28 2011Filmmaker Andrew Niccol is a deep thinker. Just look at his resume writer of ""The Truman Show""; writer/director of ""Gattaca"" and ""Lord of War."" Each of those movies and even the dreadful ""S1m0ne"" has grappled with some Big Idea - the nature of reality eugenics mans capacity for violence. So its no surprise that his latest effort is a heady affair. Set in a dystopian future in which time is quite literally money ""In Time"" engages with philosophy and politics in a way that few action movies do. What is a surprise is that the film - starring Justin Timberlake as a Robin Hood-like character who gives new meaning to the term ""time bandit"" - is not just thoughtful but brisk and engaging. In Niccols invented universe everyone has been genetically engineered to stop aging at 25. (This leads to a cute running joke which starts when Timberlakes Will Salas greets a character played by Olivia Wilde as ""Mom."") Youre given a year to live at that point which will go up if you work hard (salaries are paid in minutes not dollars) or down if youre a spendthrift. Here the price of everything - food clothing rent - is measured by a clock not a checkbook. A digital readout on your forearm keeps track of how much time you have left down to the second. As in the real world there are the haves and the have-nots. Residents of the ghetto where Will lives (called punningly Dayton) live from day to day. Most never have very much in the bank but they manage to get by. Until they dont at which point they drop dead. Its called ""timing out"" or if theyve been robbed by a gang of time-jackers known as the Minutemen having their ""clock cleaned."" By the way youve never heard so many time-themed double-entendres in your life. ""You got a minute?"" a panhandling girl asks Will. ""Take five"" he tells her before offering her several of his own minutes. Many of the characters are named after brands of expensive timepieces and high-end watch parts Borel Breitling Jaeger etc. Its a bit much. Mostly though Niccol keeps his eye not on the clock but on the action which is set in motion when Will comes into a lot of extra time courtesy of Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer) an old man who has grown tired of living and who happens to have more than a century socked away. But Will gets more than a new lease on life; he also learns the truth about how the unequal system works. Its a political wake-up call for our hero who becomes radicalized. Will travels to the exclusive enclave of New Greenwich - get it Greenwich mean time? - where the wealthy 1 percent who control most of the worlds time live. There he falls in with the rebellious daughter (Amanda Seyfried) of a wealthy industrialist (Vincent Kartheiser). The two set out to perform a little unauthorized redistribution of wealth. Meanwhile Will is being pursued by a dogged cop (Cillian Murphy) known as a timekeeper who thinks Will robbed and killed Henry. Thats the action part of the movie and its lively and well acted enough to keep you from checking your watch. Its the movies themes however that may keep you awake at night. Niccol has fashioned an effective economic allegory that could well become a rallying cry for the Occupy Wall Street movement. And its philosophy - that there is nothing more precious than time - is a pretty if hackneyed sentiment. All in all ""In Time"" is not just stylish but surprisingly substantial. From now on youll think twice every time you hear the phrase ""rollover minutes."" Contains some violence.

C+ In Time Genre Sci-fi and Fantasy Mystery and Thriller; Starring Amanda Seyfried Justin Timberlake Cillian Murphy Olivia Wilde; Director Andrew Niccol; Author Andrew Niccol; Release Date Wide 10/28/2011; Runtime (in minutes) 109; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation Posted November 9 2011 -- 1200 AM EST In Time the new sci-fi allegorical action thriller takes off from a premise thats shrewd fun original and (in every sense) timely. In a not-so-distant future when the middle class has collapsed and the wealth is controlled by one percent of the population everyone gets to live until theyre 25 years old -- and from that moment on theyre living on borrowed or stolen time. Each person who has passed the quarter-century mark has a digital clock embedded in their forearm (the green numbers appear right on the skin) that registers how much time they have left before they kick off. Once youre 25 you dont age physically but you can keep living as long as you keep adding to that time clock. Some have just a few weeks or days left; others have years or even centuries. The thing is you can get more time -- by having it transferred from others (a literal arm-to-arm exchange) or earning it on the job or procuring it illegally. Time in this society is literally money Things are paid for in temporal units (a cup of coffee costs four minutes; a fancy car will set the buyer back five months). Justin Timberlake tense and in command stars as Will Salas a dude from one of the ghetto zones who as the movie opens is down to his final hours. That is until he meets a rich kid in a bar who is worth centuries. The kid doesnt want to live anymore so after Will rescues him from a violent encounter he gives Will all of his time. This gives Will the chance to buy his way across the ghetto zones and into New Greenwich the gleaming city of moneyed aristocrats where the one percent live. Along the way hes pursued by a cop played by pasty android-eyed Cillian Murphy who looks scarier in every film. He hooks up with a rich girl played by Amanda Seyfried decked out in an Anna Karina-meets-Lady Gaga wig that all but swallows her looks and also overwhelms what there is of her performance. (There isnt much). And of course he Fights the System. In Time was directed by Andrew Niccol who showed a gift for science fiction in Gattaca (1997) and for about 45 minutes the movie is taut and intriguing. The whole time thing really works -- physically and also metaphorically as an almost too-perfect symbol of our own lopsided wealth culture and of the desperation of those who literally feel like theyre running out of resources. But the movie Im sad to report has a majorly disappointing follow-through. It turns into a noisy squalling chase movie. Timberlake and Seyfrieds relationship is way too thin to make us believe in them as a powerful outlaw couple and the plot once you get past the premise is basically all cliches. In Time so runs out of imaginative gas that I cant in the end recommend it. Yet Timberlake in his best scenes reminds you that he really is a natural actor. He just needs to find a movie worthy of his hot/cool Gen-Y Steve McQueen squint.

"In Time Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Olivia WildeMovie review In TimeThis flawed yet intriguing film conjures a future in which the minutes and hours of ones life are preciously held a and lethally coveted a commodities.October 28 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried in ""In Time."" (Stephen Vaughan / 20th Century...)If only if only if only.a| Where to begin with ""In Time"" a a very ""if only"" proposition with Justin Timberlake Amanda Seyfried Cillian Murphy Olivia Wilde and countless other young beauties living and dying very fast in this futurist action-thriller. Lets see If only the ticking clock were more tightly wound; if only more time were used to develop the romance and relationships; if only dying didnt seem so easy. Writer-director Andrew Niccol a whiz at mind games having written such brain teases as ""The Truman Show"" has conjured up yet another clever idea. ""In Time"" takes place in a future where the aging gene automatically stops at 25 so its a world that truly does belong to the ""young."" Its also a world of hurt because just how long life extends beyond that magic number depends on how much time you can beg borrow buy or steal. Time is money literally the coin of the realm. And once you hit 25 roughly that point in life when your frontal lobe matures and you totally know how to do your hair the race begins. Life is bought one day one hour even one second at a time. Glow-in-the-dark numbers on your forearm (not-so-subtle echoes of German concentration camp counting) keep track of time left in a second-by-second countdown. Tick tick tick. You can hand over your time with a sort of secret handshake which is a little too easy and feels like a cheat. Nearly every twist and turn of the plot seems designed to remind of that most fundamental truth a every moment alive puts you one step closer to death. In this new age its called ""timing out"" a very neat and tidy process a too neat and tidy. So the tension started by all that ticking too quickly drains away. Scientists may have figured out how to stop aging but avarice is still a problem which sets in motion the action. The police police time to make sure no one is getting it illegally with the main Timekeeper Raymond Leon (played by a steel-jawed Murphy) who we learn is really 50. Dont you wish. As is Wilde who plays Rachel Salas mom to Timberlakes Will. Did I mention this is science fiction? There are moguls who are mean and have more time than God which they bank in banks. Chief among them is a calculatingly evil Philippe Weis (""Mad Mens"" Vincent Kartheiser well-turned-out here too) with daughter Sylvia (Seyfried) the apple of Daddys eye a although whether he loves her or time more will be tested. There are regular bad guys time thieves called Minutemen led by Alex Pettyfer who seems to be getting a little too comfortable in bad-guy roles (""Beastly"" ""Tormented"") as Fortis. Meanwhile inflation is rampant; the class divide is growing ever wider; the world is ripe for an action hero. Cue Timberlake. ""In Time"" was supposed to turn Timberlake into a superhero though given the way he manages a fairly massive pop career with an increasingly impressive acting portfolio (""Social Network"" most recently) that may not be necessary. He brings an interesting sensibility to his characters Will included that suggest a complex interior that ""In Time"" never quite reveals. The same goes for Seyfried (""Mamma Mia"" ""Red Riding Hood"") who can do a lot more than use those big eyes and sleek lines. Shot on location in Los Angeles the downtown warehouse district subs for the ghetto where most people work and live with Beverly Hills Malibu etc. representing the monied side of things. That might sound like its just the modern-day reality but the production team and veteran cinematographer Roger Deakins (""True Grit"" ""The Reader"") have reimagined things in starkly compelling ways. Especially in the ghetto. There everything is stripped to the essentials except for the layer of grime that seems to coat everything including the people. Everyone moves fast (except for the actual movie which lasts nearly two hours); they are after all running out of time. Whats missing are the kind of moments that actually matter the ones that are so gripping that you want desperately for time to stop a to savor them to feel the fear the passion the regret.

The human life span has been expanded to infinity but not everyone can afford it. Because here time is money. Workers are paid in time and to buy things they have to spend it. (A cup of coffee? Thatll be 4 minutes please.) Hours days years are like 20 100 or 10000 bills. Scott Fitzgerald was right. The rich are different because they have more money they can live forever. Some unseen government or mad-genius scientific cabal has set peoples biological clocks to expire shortly after age 25 unless they bank extra time by working longer borrowing at usurious rates or stealing time. Its literally your money or your life. Each person has a phosphorescent tattoo on his forearm ticking away that tells how much time is left. Its both a reminder of the bearers mortality and a temptation to vandals known as Minutemen who set upon the unwary and clean their clocks. Oddly no one thinks to protect that information by wearing a metal sheath to cover the arm. That makes people as vulnerable to predators as a bejeweled matron walking through a rough neighborhood. (MORE Read Richard Corliss Picks for the All-TIME 100 Movies) Tantalizing premises--political satire masquerading as science fiction--are Niccols own movie currency. The New Zealander wrote The Truman Show about a man (Jim Carrey) who doesnt realize that his life is a carefully scripted reality program. Niccols films as writer-director include Gattaca with Ethan Hawke as the rare home-made man in a world of genetically modified superfolks and Simone or S1mOne in which a moviemaker creates a sexy new star out of a computer program. His hard-to-ignore theme societys attempts to engineer perfection are ethically egregious and doomed to failure. In Time is Niccols most explicit denunciation of inequality and a parable of the rich getting richer as the poor lose time. Its a great idea that Niccol cant translate into a great movie. Will Salis (Justin Timberlake) is a wage slave in the working-class time zone of Dayton where prices keep rising as wages remain stagnant and where his mother (Olivia Wilde who since she hasnt visibly aged looks more like Wills dream date) dies because her clock runs out and no one will literally give her the time of day. When a rich guy Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer) is set upon by the Minutemen Will saves him and takes him home. There he learns that Henry is 105 with another century still on his forearm and tired of living. As Will sleeps Henry transfers his time to Will leaves and allows himself to die. A monitoring camera implicates Will in Henrys death and from then hes on the run. His pursuer is the implacable Timekeeper Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy)--Javert to Wills Jean Valjean. Will drives from Daytons Zone 12 to the Zone 4 town where the super-rich supercentenarians live. Its called New Greenwich which might be the ritzy city in Connecticut or a reference to the London suburb that housed the Royal Observatory whose clocks set time for the world Greenwich Mean Time. (To the 99% living outside that posh zone time couldnt be meaner.) In a casino out of an early James Bond movie Will gambles against the worlds richest man Philippe Weis (Vincent Kartheiser who plays spoiled Pete Campbell on Mad Men). When Philippe loses at the tables he tells Will ""Youve taken years off my life"" but no matter Philippe is worth ""eons."" He introduces Will to three women--his mother wife and daughter--all looking indistinguishably young and fabulous like classier Kardashian girls. Daughter Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried of Big Love and Mamma Mia) becomes Wills accomplice when he escapes from Philippe and the Timekeeper and heads back to Dayton to free time so to speak. Robbing a bank and redistibuting precious hours to the poor Sylvia and Will become the futures Bonnie and Clyde--time bandits. In Time like last weeks Margin Call has lucked into a historical moment when its message feeds off the headlines. As the Occupy Wall Street movement spreads across the country the Congressional Budget Office reports that in the past three decades the wealth of Americas top 1% has spiked by 275%. The 99% toiling in all the Daytons of the country get nowhere because the suave idlers in New Greenwich have hoarded the wealth. Its Darwinian capitalism only the rich survive--forever. ""For a few to be immortal"" Philippe says ""many must die."" But Will is a Robin Hood socialist who believes that ""None should be immortal if even one person has to die."" One problem with In Time is that its more fun to describe than to sit through. (Which is why Ive lavished so much space on the plot synopsis.) Another is that Niccols direction of his cast is spotty at best. Timberlake has the steely visage and stubbled cheeks for a rogue hero but Seyfried always a watchable presence has trouble connecting with Sylvias inner rebellious streak or for that matter lending urgency to her line readings. The films crucial failing though is that Niccols imagination is vigorously literary but not thrillingly cinematic. The movie exhausts its capital about halfway through--devolving as the Timekeeper tracks the lovers on the run into a series of car chases and foot races none of them very spiffily executed. If youre like me you will be captivated by the first hour and after that impatiently checking your watch.

This wise and beautiful little film is about two lovers falling from a state of grace. Watch a clip of Paramounts ""Like Crazy."" The outward impediment to their romance is a bureaucratic tangle. Anna (Felicity Jones) a vivacious young Englishwoman in her senior year at a California college falls in love with Jacob (Anton Yelchin) a touchingly tender young American whos been studying furniture design. After graduation she overstays her student visa by a couple of months to spend the summer with him. After a quick trip home to visit her parents Anna returns to California where U.S. immigration officials discover her visa violation refuse her entry and put her on the next flight back to London. At a time when illegal immigration is a hot-button topic Annas troubles might seem trivial. But her offense and the complicated long-distance relationship that ensues are only pretexts for a heartbreaking study of passionate love that deprived of proximity turn into confusion little lies on both sides then bigger lies and worst of all self-betrayal. ENLARGE Anton Yelchin and Felicity Jones in Like Crazy. Paramount Vantage ""Like Crazy"" was directed by Drake Doremus who wrote the script with Ben York Jones. Yet the written words arent necessarily the ones that come out of the actors mouths since most of the dialogue was improvised. I didnt realize that going in. I try to know as little as possible about a given film in advance of seeing it and this one undercut my conviction that actors improvisations lead more often than not to spontaneous banality. (My assumption about John Guleserians beautiful cinematography was similarly upset. I would have bet that hed shot on 35mm film. In fact he used the video function of a Canon EOS 7D a digital still camera that sells on the consumer market for about 1500 plus lenses and often travels on vacationers necks.) Ms. Jones and Mr. Yelchin are spontaneous all right. So too are Jennifer Lawrence as Jacobs fallback girlfriend (though I wish shed had a more substantial role) and Alex Kingston and Oliver Muirhead as Annas parents. But Anna and Jacob are also eloquent in their respective ways--Ms. Jones with her very English verbal fluency Mr. Yelchin with his very American syntactic vagueness--and all the more so in the silence of their expressions. Seldom has a script found such resonance in its lovers eyes body language and inward gazes. At one point in their relationship with Anna stuck in England while the U.S. Embassy reviews her case Jacob gives her a silver bracelet engraved with one word Patience. The same advice applies to moviegoers. ""Like Crazy"" develops slowly and threatens at first to be just another movie about beautiful young people in the Age of Fraught Relationships. Its much more than that though. Without belaboring any issues it speaks volumes about fear of commitment--Annas father offers the cheerfully old-fashioned suggestion that she and Jacob solve her visa problem by getting married--about inconstancy in any age about anxiety bred of mendacity about the dangers as well as the pleasures of impulsivity and the mystery of what if anything a pledge of love means. Patience pays off at least for us. Watch a film clip of director Chris Millers new animation movie ""Puss in Boots"" starring Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek. Clip Courtesy of DreamWorks. Puss in Boots Dont think of this charming 3-D animated feature as a spin-off from ""Shrek"" so much as a lift-off for the swashbuckling feline voiced by Antonio Banderas. Puss made his debut in ""Shrek 2"" then did time in the two decreasingly funny sequels. Now hes got a movie of his own and not a moment too soon. ""Puss in Boots"" exults in extravagant images while Mr. Banderas makes its hero--""Poos"" as his name is pronounced by most of the Spanish-accented characters--a paragon of sophisticated wit. You cant help but smile at his first Zorro-esque line accompanied by a guitar strum ""Through the years I have been known by many names."" And you sense a bright comic imagination at work when he bellies up to a bar orders milk and purrs ""I am but a humble gato looking for his next meal."" ENLARGE The titular feline swashbuckler in Puss in Boots. DreamWorks Animation A dramatic imagination is another story. The plot is little more than a string of collisions and events with a Tom-and-Jerry flavor that gets seriously diluted over the course of 90 minutes. Puss teams up with Humpty Dumpty (a creepily epicene ovoid voiced with eerie plaintiveness by Zach Galifianakis) to repay an old debt by stealing some magic beans from Jack and Jill. Along the way they climb a beanstalk that looks like a sky-scraping strand of DNA encounter a baby goose noticeably smaller than the golden eggs it lays a mother goose with the dimensions and disposition of King Kong and Kitty Softpaws a sexy cat burglar--that is to say a cat who burgles preferably by picking pockets-- played by Salma Hayek. When Puss and Kitty meet they throw themselves into a showstopper of a flamenco dance fight and do an equally effective reprise awhile later. But it isnt quite correct to say they stop the show which constantly functions in fits and starts--appealing set pieces inspired displays of animation (almost too much of too many brilliant things) and above all a performance by Mr. Banderas that defines the essence of droll. His voice is the gatos meow. Anonymous Watch a clip of Roland Emmerichs political thriller ""Anonymous"". Video courtesy of Sony/Columbia. Roland Emmerich has all but ended the world in such action spectaculars as ""Independence Day"" ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and ""2012."" In ""Anonymous"" he extinguishes literary scholarship by contending that Shakespeares plays were written by Edward de Vere Earl of Oxford. So all right then thats taken care of. Edward (played by Rhys Ifans) is the man we should have been honoring all along and Will Shakespeare an amiable buffoon as well as an indifferent actor took credit where it wasnt due. One problem with ""Anonymous"" though is what it says about the writers trade. Shakespeare--I mean Edward--is an unhappy man. ""The voices"" he cries. ""I cant stop them I would go mad if I didnt write down the voices."" He gets no sympathy from his wife. ""My God"" she says with disgust ""youre writing again."" And toward the end of his life he muses glumly ""Words merely words will be my sole legacy."" Didnt he even have fun writing his comedies? ENLARGE Rhys Ifans in Anonymous. Columbia Pictures A bigger problem with ""Anonymous"" is its opacity. The nonsensical notion of Edwards authorship is hardly more than a subplot. (He decided to hide it according to John Orloffs screenplay--which was actually written by whom?--out of fear that his plays were dangerously critical of powerful figures in Queen Elizabeths court.) Most of the movie is devoted to the Essex Rebellion against the queen and the action hops back and forth in time so befuddlingly with the same set of characters played by different actors that I defy anyone who isnt a scholar of the period to understand whats going on. (Which is not to suggest that I did.) Joely Richardson is engaging as the young queen but her mother Vanessa Redgrave is something else as Queen Bess in her powdered dotage. That something varies from moment to moment scene to scene. Sometimes shes distracted to the point of dottiness sometimes shes sharp as a tack and still seductive. In a movie that rings false at every turn Ms. Redgraves Elizabeth is truly and infallibly regal. In Time Andrew Niccols ""In Time"" looks great sounds stilted and plays like a clever videogame with too many rules. The premise builds on the notion that time is money. In the movies dystopian future where todays cars have tomorrows grilles time has replaced money. People are born with genetic clocks that stop at the age of 25; after that theyve got one year in which to beg borrow steal or even earn more time. If they dont the digital clocks embedded in their forearms dwindle down to zero and they time out i.e. die. Thats clever right? But then there are roving gangs called Minute Men (Teddy Boy types out of ""A Clockwork Orange"") who steal time; the borderline-silly spectacle of almost everyone looking 25; the polemic element of social injustice (the richest of the rich can live forever because theyve got eons socked away); and the action-adventure element a clumsy amalgam of Robin Hood ""Bonnie and Clyde"" ""The Avengers"" ""Les Miserables"" ""Dick Tracy"" (for the color and graphics) and Mr. Niccols earlier and impressive genetic-engineering opus ""Gattaca."" Amanda Seyfried and Justin Timberlake are the Bonnie and Clyde stand-ins though Ms. Seyfrieds makeup and wig suggest Anna Karina in an old Godard film. Its hard to judge their performances since they were clearly encouraged to be as stylized as the photography and sets by a director who given the evidence on screen came up short in the department of humor and was tone deaf to their American accents. (The English Minute Men sound fine.) It couldnt be easier on the other hand to judge Roger Deakinss cinematography Alex McDowells production design or Colleen Atwoods costumes; theyre all top-notch. Still one question lingers. In a film shot in and around Los Angeles why do all the car chases through all of the fictional regions time zones look like they were staged on the same venerable bridge across the Los Angeles River? ENLARGE Charlie Bartlett (2007) Charlie is a precocious young high-school student who both pops and pushes pills and Anton Yelchin plays him as a rich overmedicated Candide. The kids stash of the stuff is so copious thanks to an indulgent psychiatrist that he starts sharing it with his schoolmates and dispensing therapy along with the pills in the boys room. The cast includes Hope Davis at her best as Charlies libidinous mother Robert Downey Jr. as the schools bibulous principal and Kat Dennings as his daughter. Jon Poll directed from a script by Gustin Nash. The cinematographer was the estimable Paul Sarossy. Shakespeare in Love (1998) The Earl of Oxford may have written this too but Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard got screen credit for what is by unanimous agreement among Shakespearean scholars a totally fictional account of how a Bard with writers block sought help from a shrink (who timed patients sessions with an hourglass) and churned out ""Romeo and Juliet"" only after discovering his muse in a dishy brainy aristocrat named Lady Viola. Joseph Fiennes is Will Gwyneth Paltrow is Viola Geoffrey Rush is Philip Henslowe Shakespeares frantic gap-toothed producer and Judi Dench is the formidable Queen Elizabeth. The director was John Madden. Letters to Juliet (2010) Im not in love with this confection but I couldnt resist its intersections with ""Anonymous"" and ""In Time"" too. Amanda Seyfrieds Sophie a New Yorker magazine fact-checker goes to Verona to join volunteers who answer a ceaseless stream of letters addressed to Juliet. (The letter part is true.) She uncovers one written by an ardent English girl who is now a septuagenarian played by Vanessa Redgrave. And played so wonderfully well that watching her in action is like sitting in on a master class. Gary Winick directed from a cloying script by Jose Rivera and Tim Sullivan.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + For addicts of forearm close-ups ""In Time is the most important movie of the year. Here the future is one in which time is the only currency that matters and whenever people want to see how much they have left sleeves are pushed back to reveal an electroluminescent digital clock. The movie is almost shallow enough to make rolling up a shirt sleeve the sexiest thing a man can do. Of course theres no explanation of when or how we turned into a race stamped with Timex Indiglo technology. But the movie tries to do for forearms what the loosely similar science-fiction romance ""The Adjustment Bureau attempted for mens hats make them chic.Andrew Niccol wrote and directed this pitifully titled movie and one hurdle he fails to clear involves the frustration of watching so many shots of rapidly elapsing days and hours. Eventually we start wondering how long until the film kicks the bucket. That mounting exasperation produces other questions. For one thing Whats this movie about? The opening narration is an example of the tautological banality Niccol is settling for ""It is what it is says our hero a ""ghetto kid named Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) who finds himself caught up in a nominal chase thriller.This movie tries to build a world that like good science fiction presumes to double as a dispatch from not-too-far-from-now and an allegory for how we currently live. At age 25 the physical aging process ceases and life becomes a constant pursuit of rollover minutes. Failure results in a permanent service interruption. A cup of coffee costs time the bus costs time time costs time - you pay by placing your wrist in the cradle of a scanner. Having enough minutes to scrape by is a problem for the putative 99 percent of people. One-percenters forearms glow with enough centuries to live forever. One suicidal fellow (Matt Bomer) with too much time on his hands gives all his to Will by putting their wrists together. That transfer makes Will both a wanted murder suspect and wealthy enough to gain entry to New Greenwich home of the rich and apparently soulless (most of the movie seems set in Los Angeles but the fictional maps we see beg to differ).New Greenwich affluence is embodied by an ancient time magnate inhabiting the youthful body of Philippe Weis (Vincent Kartheiser whos as slippery here as he is on ""Mad Men). Will kidnaps Philippes flirtatious pageboyed daughter Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried) who discovers she likes her kidnapper almost as much as she enjoys chenille and running in block heels. These two wind up on the lam in a plot sure to gladden supporters of Occupy Wall Street and annoy anyone who knows they could be watching ""Bonnie and Clyde ""Logans Run ""Natural Born Killers ""Inception ""Patty Hearst or actual Occupy footage instead. Niccol fancies himself a filmmaker with something to say. He made the similarly slick equally undercooked genetics thriller ""Gattaca and a Nicolas Cage action-rant about arms proliferation called ""Lord of War his best film. He also wrote the on-camera satire ""The Truman Show. Niccol is smart and his movies are handsome and enticingly visual but his thinking rarely goes deeper than whats topical. Hes the intellectual equivalent of a stick-on tattoo. ""In Time verges on incisive dark comedy (weve become our devices) but Niccol feels compelled to meet market demands for wearisome Hollywood trends. For instance Cillian Murphy plays a time cop chasing Will in leather dusters and boots borrowed from the ""Matrix collection. These might be the costume designer Colleen Atwoods least imaginative clothes. New Greenwich appears to be where old Versace ads eat a lot of salad.Theres no risk in Niccols ideas. Will lives in temporal poverty with a 50-year-old mother whos played by 27-year-old Olivia Wilde. Weis makes a daughter-or-wife joke about Sylvia. But for all the references to Darwins greatest hits (""natural selection ""survival of the fittest) and with so many sexy parents aged the same as their sexy children its hard to believe that theres no incest problem. Niccol has a few scenes of good banter between Timberlake and Seyfried but hes too self-serious to keep that up in a movie eager to stage generic foot and car chases. The movie exists in part to convey a tedious obsession with puns. To wit ""Id say your money or your life but your money is your life.We also hear a lot of talk of the ghetto and of a conspiracy to keep the poor in poverty but it feels unrealized and not because Timberlake is the face of indigence (although theres that) but because the movies metaphor never feels urgent. Wheres the real social danger. Wheres the hunger and the edge in these so-called ghettos? The movie seems afraid to use conspiracy theory to foment real rebellion. Its an allegory for striving hustling desperation and justice that looks like a fashion designers runway show. Are these people hungry because theyre poor or because they have a noon photo shoot? Niccol might have driven through some needy neighborhoods but this movie suggests hes never gotten out of his car.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""In Time"" is a sci-fi fable set in a near-future dystopia where time has become the currency but the dynamics of need and greed have remained the same. The film opens with a terse voice-over explanation of the premise People stop aging at 25. They die within a year unless they earn additional credits. Those who can amass a lot live in luxury. In the ghetto where Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) lives people get by literally one day at a time. A digital countdown clock embedded in their forearms ticks off the hours minutes and seconds remaining before they time out dwindling inexorably like a bad Equifax score. Neatly conceived but imperfectly executed the film taps into the current wave of populist anger with the state of the economy. Its not an opportunistic screed. Writer/director Andrew Niccol consistently has used fantasy to explore troublesome social issues -- genetic engineering in ""Gattaca"" deceptive mass media in ""The Truman Show"" manufactured celebrity in ""S1m0ne."" This time the theme of the morality tale is Darwinian capitalism itself with 1 percent of the population loan-sharking the rest into lives of time-starved desperation. Will is an honest lad working a factory job with time-payments that dont keep up with the cost of living. Through a fluke he inherits a time-fortune visits the arrogant elite of New Greenwich (nice name that) and learns how their system unfairly distributes pains and gains. Before you can say Bonnie and Clyde hes on a pistol-packing campaign to redistribute the bounty aided by a thrill-seeking heiress (Amanda Seyfried). On their tail are a stubborn incorruptible cop (Cillian Murphy) and a detestable stickup man (Alex Pettyfer). I liked the way the film contrasted the scuzzy industrial parks of East L.A. with the glittering skyscrapers of uber-affluent Century City and the way sleeves were custom-tailored to provide instant access to peoples forearm clocks. In another clever touch people of means get around in retro-futuristic Lincoln Continentals XKE Jaguars and Dodge Chargers -- timeless classics all. Ace cinematographer Roger Deakins makes it all look exciting but the rob-and-run action sequences are subpar. The plot is far from airtight and there are numerous contrivances that come into play to bring about the resolution. Worst of all the characters are routine. Murphy brings considerable flair to the dogged lawman mostly through inventive line readings. Timberlake is serviceable as the time bandit Robin Hood Seyfried less engaging in her tag-along part. IN TIME  out of 4 stars pgt;Rating PG-13 for violence some sexuality and partial nudity and brief strong language.

In Time Bad Director Andrew Niccol. Cast Justin Timberlake Amanda Seyfried. Rating PG-13 for violence some sexuality and partial nudity and strong language. As his character Will Salas explains in a terse voice-over humans have been genetically engineered to stop aging at 25. And from that birthday forward theyre on the clock with a balance of one year ticking off in glowing green digits across their forearms. The rich might rack up a hundred years even a thousand while the poor scramble from day to day to keep the virtual sword of Damocles from stopping their hearts. This intriguing premise has several advantages for writer-director Andrew Niccol (""Lord of War"") besides making his message about the economic injustices of capitalism starkly obvious. Its grist for puns for one -- the cops are ""timekeepers"" and the gated enclaves that separate rich from poor are ""time zones."" And when a rich man decides to commit suicide by giving Will his last 100 years he admonishes him ""Dont waste my time."" And of course the setup means the film stars only attractive young actors including Amanda Seyfried heiress Bonnie to Timberlakes ghetto Clyde and ""Mad Mens"" Vincent Kartheiser as her father who makes his fortune as a payday lender literally leeching off the lives of the poor. Niccol earned science-fiction cred for 1997s ""Gattaca"" a more sophisticated exploration of high-tech haves and have-nots but ""In Time"" is a silly muddle filled with plot holes and the future it depicts is utterly unconvincing. Time transfers for example are accomplished with wrist-to-wrist contact making it absurdly easy to rob people of their life savings. (Even though remote storage is possible folks in the ghetto apparently prefer wearing their entire existence on their sleeves.) The visuals are equally silly although this is probably due to an inadequate production budget. All the cars for example appear to be retrofitted models from the 1970s. Apparently this future is obsessed with the past. Either that or its an alternate universe where genetic engineering has raced far ahead of window-crank technology. Timberlake who had a scene-stealing turn as Napster mogul Sean Parker in ""The Social Network"" is a snooze in this role not quite as wooden as Keanu Reeves but hardly making a case for himself as an actor. Kartheiser brings some zip and smarm to the proceedings as the villain with a million years in his vault but its not nearly enough to make ""In Time"" worth your time. Or your money.

More about In Time >> And Andrew Niccol famous screenwriter (The Truman Show) and director (Gattaca) has taken Bens old saw as literally as he possibly can. In the near-futuristic thriller In Time people are engineered to stop aging at 25. You can live on - and on and on - but time is the currency and so only the very rich manage to extend their lives through the decades. Some have logged more than a century in their bodies but they still look like robust twentysomethings. Meanwhile the underclass toils in grim factories earning barely enough to keep them alive for another day. ""For a few to be immortal"" observes a smug super-wealthy gent ""many must die."" Apparently some studio genius was concerned that audiences wouldnt quite grasp this concept and so In Time begins with a pasted-on voice-over from Justin Timberlake explaining the premise. Which is too bad because a few minutes later when Timberlakes Will Salas walks into his kitchen and greets Olivia Wilde with a groggy ""Hi Mom"" the surprise that exchange would have had - the what the hey? Olivia Wilde is Justin Timberlakes mom? - has been thwarted pre-empted kiboshed. In Time is that kind of movie Philip K. Dick for knuckleheads. What happens next? Well Will a working stiff saves a guy in a snappy suit from being mugged. Muggings in In Time mean stealing the minutes hours days and years that are ticking off a digital readout embedded in your arm. This guy though had wanted to be mugged and killed - after 105 years he had had enough. And so he gives his time to Will while Will is fast asleep. Will awakes like some fairy-tale hero a new man a chronological millionaire. Niccol is kicking at a couple of interesting themes here but hes kicking at them like theyre tin cans on a curb. One is our cultures obsession with youth with the quest to stay young and stave off inevitable deterioration and decrepitude. The other has to do with class warfare. Its the reason those Occupy Wall Streeters are occupying Wall Street The wealthiest one percent keep getting wealthier while the divide between the rich and the poor grows and poverty rates climb. But In Time doesnt really know where to go with these ideas falling back on the obvious and the repetitive and on the creakier conventions of the thriller genre. Will crosses the border from shabby Dayton a cinegenic ghetto to New Greenwich a community of glitzy mansions and opulent hotels running off with a moguls daughter - Amanda Seyfried in a redhead bob and a black minidress. The cops led by Cillian Murphy - theyre called timekeepers - are after Will. They think hes a killer and a thief and its not long before the on-the-lam duo turn into a kind of dystopian Bonnie and Clyde gunning a vintage Jaguar around town robbing from the rich and giving to the poor. ""We look cute together"" Seyfried says to Timberlake catching their ""Wanted"" images on a news screen. And they may look cute but they arent firing off any sparks. Chemistry-wise Timberlake and Seyfried are a failed experiment. Maybe with a little more time . . . oh never mind. Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

"In Time (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review In Time (PG-13) The premise - not the story - is the main draw in writer-director Andrew Niccols pop science-fiction thriller. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com10/27/2011 Editor rating 2.5 In the near future according to In Time human beings will be genetically engineered to stop aging at 25 -- but then you only have one year left to live. On your 25th birthday a digital clock emblazoned on your left forearm turns on and starts ticking down. When it reaches zero 365 days later you drop dead. By simply touching wrists another person can transfer some of their time to your clock or your time can be drained from you against your will. Writer-director Andrew Niccol (Gattaca Lord of War) never explains why all of humanity agreed to this strange arrangement. Overpopulation? World hunger? But if you can overlook the lack of logic inherent in its central conceit - and thats a big ask - In Time makes for a fun stylish piece of speculative sci-fi. The movie which initially sounded like a rip-off of Logans Run turns out to be a diatribe against the widely loathed 1 percent who even in this pop fantasy still control the large majority of the worlds wealth. Paper currency has been replaced by minutes (employees are paid with hours added to their clocks) and instead of living paycheck to paycheck some people live day to day -- literally. Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) who works in a factory and lives in the ghetto is 28 and has spent the last three years with only a single day left on his clock which he replenishes with hard labor. His mother (Olivia Wilde) has also learned to scrape by constantly replenishing her timer -- shes 50 -- but inflation is making survival practically impossible for the working class. The rich -- people who have amassed decades or even centuries on their life clocks -- keep raising prices on goods and services (a cup of coffee now costs a whopping four minutes) essentially feeding on the poor to keep their posh lifestyles going. Order is kept by police officers or Timekeepers whose primary job seems to be to keep the disenfranchised inside their respective zones and discourage them from visiting wealthy neighborhoods. Roving packs of gangs known as Minutemen prey on people with fat clocks draining them dry like vampires. Niccol has put so much thought and detail into the film that the hoary nature of the plot -- Will kidnaps the daughter (Amanda Seyfried) of a tycoon (Vincent Kartheiser) to try to bring down the system -- doesnt really matter. The story is derivative but the details are ingenious. Highway toll booths cost a month; phrases like ""You got a minute?"" or ""Dont waste my time"" are suddenly charged with new meaning. When Will wanders into the time zone of the rich he is immediately singled out by a waitress for doing everything ""a little too fast."" The poor unlike the rich are constantly hurrying and looking at their life clocks. In Time was shot by the great cinematographer Roger Deakins (No Country for Old Men True Grit) who gives the images a dreamy alluring polish and the art design favors stark empty spaces and simple uncomplicated gadgets (the cars in the movie are particularly cool simultaneously futuristic yet retro). Timberlake fares better as an action hero than he did as a comedic leading man in Friends with Benefits and he gets strong support from Seyfried (whose character earns a surprising number of laughs) Cillian Murphy as the relentless Timekeeper on their trail and Alex Pettyfer as a murderous Minuteman. The movie tries to do a little of everything -- Niccol even tries something fresh with that old stand-by the car chase -- and it spreads itself too thin. But even though the story wobbles the world of In Time still fascinates. If nothing else the film sets a record for the number of scenes in which characters are racing against a ticking clock and every one of those moments works you up. Seconds have never felt as precious. Cast Justin Timberlake Amanda Seyfried Cillian Murphy Vincent Kartheiser Alex Pettyfer Johnny Galecki Olivia Wilde. Writer-director Andrew Niccol.

But the riches in this case are measured in minutes and not in dollars -- time is literally money in this world and the fat-cats hoard millennia while the poor live from day to day. Time it would appear doesnt trickle down either. In this new science-fiction tale from writer-director Andrew Niccol (""Gattaca"") people stop aging at 25 and then theyre given just one more year to live. Beyond that its all about earning time. The wealthy keep eons stored away in banks while the poor borrow months at high interest while avoiding the cops (Timekeepers) and hoods (Minutemen). And when the bright green ticking clock on your forearm reaches 0000 then thats all she wrote. Will (Justin Timberlake) wakes up to celebrate the 50th birthday of his mother (Olivia Wilde -- people stay 25 forever get it?) and neither of them has a lot of time stored up. Shes paying off a loan while he trudges off to grunt work at a factory. And while the price of everything from bus fare to a cup of coffee goes up in their ""time zone"" high roller Henry (Matt Bomer) whos got more than a century on his arm shows up at a dive bar to buy drinks for everyone. Hes 110 years old and looking to end it all but before the Minutemen can roll him for his remaining time Will whisks him away and winds up being the beneficiary of Henrys suicidal impulses. Will takes his newfound wealth to New Greenwich where he bets it all at the casino and wins against magnate Philippe (Vincent Kartheiser) whose daughter Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried) has eyes for Will. When the cops -- led by Timekeeper Raymond (Cillian Murphy) -- come after Will for killing Henry he takes Sylvia hostage and before long the two become a temporal Bonnie and Clyde stealing years from Philippes loan companies and giving them to the poor. Its more than a little surprising to see a movie particularly one coming from a studio thats owned by News Corp that so flagrantly champions socialism. On more than one occasion the films wealthy characters are told that everything they have is ""stolen"" which is as close as Ive heard a Hollywood movie come to saying ""Property is theft"" maybe ever. But for all the films political chutzpah and savvy filtering of contemporary issues through sci-fi allegory ""In Time"" is a pretty dopey movie. Niccol has most of the important events of the film take place more than once so well know what were seeing (and predict it) the second time around. If youre a sucker for glossy silly science fiction along the lines of the recent Bruce Willis bust ""Surrogates"" however youll ignore the clunky dialogue and over-earnest performances and have fun anyway. ""In Time"" does at least offer up a slick retro-future with old-school muscle cars switched up to be gleaming automobiles with whizzing power sources that sound more like KitchenAid mixers than internal-combustion engines. Century City some 40 years after ""Conquest of the Planet of the Apes"" still looks like an urban center of the future and the headquarters for Creative Artists Agency -- known as the ""death star"" in the biz -- finally gets its close-up as headquarters for the nefarious Philippe. Timberlake neither shines nor embarrasses himself in the Everyman-hero role but whoever thought putting the doe-eyed Seyfried into a Louise Brooks bob was a good idea should rethink his career choices. Theres something weird about the whole cast being in their mid-20s -- the film has a certain ""Bugsy Malone"" vibe because of it -- but theres no better metaphor for Hollywoods youth fixation than the sight of Olivia Wilde playing Justin Timberlakes 50-year-old mother. Perhaps the risible dialogue (so many time puns) and over-the-top action set pieces are Niccols clever way of getting an audience to sit through a fairly audacious political allegory about the redistribution of wealth and the monstrous effects that unregulated capitalism can have on the working classes. If so hats off. In the final wash ""In Time"" may not be as well-crafted an ode to collectivism as ""Salt of the Earth"" but the car chases are way better. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

"In Time movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs In Time When time is money is more than a cliche a 2 1/2 starsOctober 27 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie criticJustin Timberlake in ""In Time.""In the future humans will be genetically engineered to live to 25.The wealthiest citizens -- the ones who either ""come from time"" the way people used to come from money or who have triumphed in this futuristic version of Darwinian capitalism -- can re-up on their time clock while others expire.You might be 50 or 105 but you look 25 always.""Hi mom"" Justin Timberlake says to Olivia Wilde early in the new film ""In Time."" Its a sharp gag She appears to be his lover not his mother. Later in the film a character introduces his mother-in-law his wife and his daughter and they all look like they just came back from an audition for ""Charmed.""In this future time is the new currency spent and borrowed like money. Each persons forearm is digitally stamped with a glowing green countdown clock displaying the time they have left. Woman A can gift Man B 30 minutes or a day by a simple forearm handclasp. The economy in this version of the future is subject to wild inflationary swings. Sample dialogue ""Four minutes? For a cup of coffee?""The writer-director of ""In Time"" New Zealand-born Andrew Niccol greases this nifty premise as best he can. (His previous films include ""Gattaca"" and the less well-regarded ""Simone""; he also wrote ""The Truman Show"" and more recently wrote and directed the arms-dealing picaresque ""Lord of War."") The little details keep clicking into place. ""Around here theyll kill ya for a week"" someone says of the inner-city neighborhood or ""time zone"" where Timberlakes Will Salas scrambles to stay alive.Just before committing suicide a wealthy stranger gives Will the gift of a century -- literally 100 years. The Javert-like emblem of the law a ""timekeeper"" played by Cillian Murphy suspects Will of murder. On the run Will takes the daughter (Amanda Seyfried) of a heartless tycoon (Vincent Kartheiser) as a hostage. Soon she becomes his partner in gunpoint philanthropy because hes dreamy and a pretty good fellow and in time ""In Time"" turns into the movie years most sincere ode to the redistribution of wealth led by Robin Hood and his Merry Moll.Frustratingly Niccols technique isnt up to his premise. The movie offers roughly 60 minutes of story complication stretched out to 109. Even with the help of a crisp cool nighttime and daylight palette offered by cinematographer Roger Deakins the director lacks an energizing way with a simple action sequence or a page of expository dialogue. I like a lot of the film despite its drawbacks; its violence isnt rote or numbing and theres a simplicity and elegance to the digital-countdown effect. Niccol would likely benefit from a more aggressive editor not because the overall running time of ""In Time"" is a chore but because the internal rhythms of even the better scenes could use a little zap.mjphillipstribune.comIn Time -- 2 1/2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for violence some sexuality and partial nudity and brief strong language)Cast Justin Timberlake (Will Salas); Amanda Seyfried (Sylvia Weis); Cillian Murphy (Raymond Leon); Vincent Kartheiser (Philippe Weis); Olivia Wilde (Rachel Salas); Alex Pettyfer (Fortis)Credits Written and directed by Andrew Niccol; produced by Andrew Niccol Eric Newman and Marc Abraham.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet ""I dont have time to worry about how it happened"" protagonist Justin Timberlake says at the beginning of In Time. The ""it"" in question is the system by which his dystopian future is run and Timberlake is warning viewers up front that all the upcoming plot holes and improbabilities will be glossed over with a hand-wave and a series of half-baked heavily symbolic catchphrases about time. In the world of In Time everyone stops aging at 25 and glowing green clocks in their arms start counting down the remaining year until they die. Time is currency and can be earned through work or spent for necessities but anyone caught short will automatically drop dead when their arm-clock hits 0000. As one of the sweating ghettoized poor Timberlake struggles to earn enough time to keep ahead of his own countdown until a suicidal slumming aristocrat gifts him with more than a century plus the admonishment ""Dont waste my time."" From there Timberlake has to decide whether to enjoy his new riches or use them to buck a crooked oppressive system. The time-equals-money equation is a clever metaphor for discussing economic inequities. Timberlakes world is an exaggerated painfully literal one but theres a potential for Brazil-like self-aware parody in a system where the poor can actually watch their time run out as they work in grimy grey dystopia-standard factories while the rich idly lounge about in opulent splendor squandering resources that would keep thousands of people alive. But writer-director Andrew Niccol addresses it all with the overwrought grimness of Equilibrium or Minority Report albeit with less visual flash. And his constant time references (""Got a minute?"" a street beggar asks Timberlake hoping for the equivalent of spare change) and pointed speechifying spell out a symbolism thats laid on so thickly it chokes out the human story. Much like Niccols Gattaca in which genetic perfection rather than time was the weapon a small group of snobby unworthy elites used to hold down the meek masses In Time is a chilly stiff movie where clever ideas are delivered as self-righteous sermons. Timberlakes rigidity doesnt help; hes playing the kind of soulful vulnerable action-movie hero who protects himself with a grim mask and an occasional smirk but the resulting performance is anonymous and bland. Meanwhile Amanda Seyfried as the obligatory love interest is a beautiful shell little more than a wide-eyed mirror of the heros awesomeness and their outlaw romance is a shallower sillier take on Bonnie And Clyde or Badlands. Cillian Murphy as the timekeeping cop devoted to the purity of the system is similarly muffled by a script that turns him into a cartoon Javert and a preachy mouthpiece for metaphor. If Niccol just trusted his audience to recognize their own lives onscreen instead of repeatedly explaining those lives to them he would have had a lot more free time which could have been used to make his characters less like allegories and more like people.

So it wasnt just me. But it says something about our times I guess that the phrase would even come up in reference to a motion picture that could just as well be called grade-B dystopian sci-fi or an attempt to position Justin Timberlake as an action star. New Zealand-born writer-director Andrew Niccol he of ""Gattaca"" and ""S1m0ne"" has been making chilly satirical almost-excellent science-fiction movies and thrillers for years; he cannot possibly have known that this particular one -- which advocates nothing short of full-on class warfare -- would land right on top of the Occupy Wall Street moment. I mean could he?In the greater scheme of movie history ""In Time"" isnt going to end up as an especially memorable entry. Its a cool-looking medium-budget futuristic nightmare in the post-Orwell post-""Blade Runner"" post-""Matrix"" vein neither the best nor worst example youve ever seen. (The cinematography is by the masterful Roger Deakins which is a major plus.) It suggests a lot of movies that are probably better like ""Se7en"" and ""Children of Men"" and ""Minority Report"" and a whole bunch that are undoubtedly worse. (Let me throw in yet another plug here for Guy Ritchies underappreciated and thoroughly insane ""Revolver."") Niccol was almost certainly thinking more about the 70s and 80s dystopian tradition of ""Logans Run"" ""Soylent Green"" and ""The Running Man"" than about contemporary politics.Still the guy gets props for being weirdly and accidentally on time with ""In Time"" and also for the best-ever high-concept premise that allows him to cast only beautiful young actors. See in the downscale urban future (which strongly resembles the downscale urban past circa 1978) everyone is genetically engineered to stop aging at 25 -- and to die at 26. On your 25th birthday a phosphorescent digital clock in your arm starts counting down that last year and that time is literally money the societys only currency. If you can accumulate more of it through work or crime or gambling or the good fortune of birth you can live on indefinitely -- albeit in constant fear of dying through violence or by accident. But the poor in the downtrodden ""time zone"" where Timberlakes character Will Salas grew up must literally live day to day borrowing or stealing or working double shifts to keep themselves from ""timing out."" (There are several background details that made me crack up like a painted advertisement for the ""99-second store."")So my anonymous friend in the theater was absolutely right since it was Karl Marx who observed that the workers only capital in the modern economy is his labor power or vital force and the capitalist seeks to drain it out of him day by day at the cheapest possible rate allowing the worker the sustenance to continue but little more. Under late capitalism i.e. large-scale consumer capitalism to be sure that equation was altered significantly at least in the developed world. The question we now face is whether that system is collapsing. ""In Time"" one could say forecasts a world in which it has done so -- a world in which a tiny minority have found immortality but lost their souls while the mass of working people has been reduced once again to an economic subjugation that is based on a supposedly free and fair exchange of labor for capital but is every bit as thorough as slavery or feudalism. But before I assign you a research paper on the ""Economic amp; Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844"" lets get back to Justin Timberlake and his fellow hotties. You Might Also Like Niccol hasnt just made a Marxist B-movie (see also John Carpenters ""They Live"") hes made one in which 27-year-old Olivia Wilde plays the mother of 30-year-old Timberlake. Not his girlfriend or his sister or his gun-slingin rival but his smokin mom. See shes 50 years old but permanently frozen at 25 and Timberlakes character is 28 and permanently frozen at 25 and slithery unctuous kazillionaire Philippe Weis (Vincent Kartheiser aka Pete Campbell from ""Mad Men"") is like 135 but permanently -- you get the idea. After Will accumulates hundreds of years in illicit currency and breaks out of his proletarian zone into the ultra-rich province of New Greenwich he visits Philippes luxurious mansion and is introduced to his wife his mother-in-law and his daughter each of them equally nubile.I generally think that Timberlake is an agreeable screen presence self-effacing and funny but just as he didnt quite establish himself as a sexy leading man in ""Friends With Benefits"" Im not sure he quite looks like the next action hero here. I mean hes fine but his Bonnie-and-Clyde romance with Amanda Seyfried (as rich girl Sylvia Weis Philippes daughter) is arguably the least interesting element of a movie that starts out terrific and gets more perfunctory and routine as it goes along. I think Timberlakes at his best as a supporting player as in ""The Social Network"" (and really has he ever outdone his lip-sync musical number in ""Southland Tales""?). Irish oddball actor Cillian Murphy nearly steals the show as a moody conflicted Timekeeper one of the currency cops who maintains order -- so much so that I wish the movie were about him. Kartheiser also glitters in the villains role hinting at a depth and complexity of character that Niccols script really doesnt afford him. So yeah -- even if ""In Time"" descends from its gripping and thought-provoking premise into a mediocre chase thriller before its over its still pretty damn satisfying to watch in the current climate. Of course the contradictions of capitalism are just as present in eras of widespread affluence as in eras of recession or stagnation but we see them a hell of a lot more clearly at the moment. Niccol is dramatizing the human costs of the concentration of wealth expressed by Philippe in the film with the formula that some must die so others can live forever. Somewhere Marx quips that capital is immortal even if its possessors are not; this movies imaginative leap is to conflate the two and build a world where even death the great leveler in human affairs can be bought off.

A tightrope walk between inspired high-concept storytelling and near-agonizing obviousness Andrew Niccols ""In Time"" takes place in a retro dimension where everyone is 25 til the day they die. Time is money as the rich measure their wealth in centuries while the poor scrape by for a few extra minutes all painfully aware that life ends the second their accounts run empty. Its a fascinating philosophical conceit delivered as a slick hyper-stylized conspiracy yarn juicy enough to deliver on both fronts provided you dont ask too many questions. Interest should sync with that of recent sci-fiers ""The Adjustment Bureau"" and ""Source Code."" In a return to the elegant streamlined view of the future presented in ""Gattaca"" and ""The Truman Show"" -- or perhaps some parallel universe where the continents are shaped like ours and no matter where you go everything looks like Los Angeles -- writer-director Niccol turns back the clock a dozen years effectively erasing the disappointment of his intervening efforts ""Simone"" and ""Lord of War."" The way it works citizens are divided into time zones according to class. In the ghetto guys like Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) live hour-to-hour keeping a careful eye on the bright green life-expectancy timers embedded in their forearms. The most reliable way to buy themselves more time is to spend some it on the job though renegades (such as Alex Pettyfers dandy-dressing English-accented gangster) run around robbing people for a few hours. Nobody walks in the ghetto; time is far too precious. In the more upscale time zones however its a different story Leisure is a way of life bought at the expense of the working poor -- a lesson Will learns when a suicidal chap (Matt Bomer) with a century on his clock whispers a few big secrets before taking a tumble off the nearest bridge. In true Hitchcockian fashion innocent Will has no way to explain how he acquired 100-plus years a situation that puts him on the lam from a squad of officious time keepers led by Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy). As science fiction goes ""In Time"" is the type that alters a few intriguing variables while otherwise preserving enough of the real world to illuminate aspects of our current system we dont normally consider. Niccols intriguing concept hinges on the ability to stop aging at the quarter-century mark and to sustain the body in mint condition as long as its owner can ""afford"" it. But the idea of time as money has real currency at a moment when world events have shaken the foundations of a paper-based banking system just as the films central inequity -- which finds Philippe Weis (""Mad Mens"" boyishly smarmy Vincent Kartheiser) exploiting the poor to feed his own immortality -- echoes the sentiments of the Occupy Wall Street crowd. Thanks to a stellar below-the-line team that includes d.p. Roger Deakins production designer Alex McDowell and costume designer Colleen Atwood ""In Time"" looks like ""Gattaca"" though the story is far more intricate and the action considerably more complex. With a major assist from second-unit action guru David M. Leitch Niccol stages shootouts and chase scenes that take full advantage of Timberlakes action-hero potential pairing him with red-wigged Amanda Seyfried as Weis daughter Sylvia a hostage-turned-accomplice in Wills efforts to upset the system. But the helmer is too much in love with his own ideas indulging every little play on words (Pettyfer ""Id say your money or your life but your money is your life""). Hes incredibly surface-oriented which makes for meticulous compositions amid beautiful environments but causes problems in casting especially since Niccol doesnt handle actors well however perfect their cheekbones may be. A rugged 30 Timberlake deepens his usually reedy voice suggesting that time is harder on those in the working class. For the most part side players fare less convincingly. Olivia Wilde is particularly ill-used except to guarantee a laugh at the films opening line (""Hi Mom"") while model-looking extras are left to flail awkwardly on the sidelines. Still the premise is rich enough to engage making it easy to forgive Niccols indulgences. What other studio director would have the nerve to counter Ayn Rand on her own turf packaging a sure-footed lefty parable as genre entertainment? Though not exactly a rallying cry for the cause ""In Time"" serves as two hours well spent for those bullied by the system and looking to let off some steam.

TWITTER Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried star in Andrew Niccols dystopian film giving new currency to Benjamin Franklins infamous quote ""Time is Money."" Its refreshing to see a low-tech major studio science fiction film in this day and age one in which the only physical manifestation of its futuristic setting is a glowing digital clock emblazened on everyones lower arm that offers a running tally on how much time theyve got to live. As novel and absorbing as In Time is in several respects however Andrew Niccols latest conception of an altered but still recognizable future feels undernourished in other ways that are not as salutary preventing the film from fulfilling its strong inherent promise. The imperiled-lovers-on-the-run action format with Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried heading an insanely attractive cast should produce decent mid-range box office totals. PHOTOS In Time Premiere Red Carpet Arrivals In fact it is hard to think of another film with such a uniformly striking lineup of actors; when in the opening minutes you have to adjust to the fact that Olivia Wilde is playing Timberlakes mother you know the casting is skewed in a very particular direction one dictated by the storys very premise At this unspecified moment in what in sure looks like but is not identified as Los Angeles the aging process stops at 25. Giving new currency to the quote attributed to Benjamin Franklin ""Time is money"" has literally become the motto of the society. Rather than striving for financial gain personal ambition is directed entirely at acquiring more time; the ""rich"" have stored up thousands even millions of years while the poor work borrow or steal to get enough just to make it to tomorrow. But when your arm clock ticks down to zero youre a goner. The specifics of this are inevitably intriguing; a phone call costs you a minute of your life breakfast in a fancy restaurant runs eight-and-a-half weeks. You can trade time with others just by locking arms but can be robbed the same way. At the outset ghetto-dwelling Will Salas (Timberlake) is the inadvertent beneficiary of this exchange system. Popping into a bar where the clientele look like models for a mixed photo shoot for Maxim and GQ Will is eventually bestowed with 100 years by a world-weary 105-year-old (Matt Bomer) who sums up the societal inequity of the system by observing that ""For a few to be immortal many must die."" VIDEO In Time Director Talks About Casting Justin Timberlake Devastated at his inability to save his mother with his newfound riches fueled by the old mans weighty parting admonition--""Dont waste my time""--and concerned that having so much time on his arm has made him a marked man Will escapes from so-called Dayton (downtown L.A. by the concrete river) and makes his way to New Greenwich (Century City to the rest of us) where he shortly ends up in a casino playing for time opposite Philippe Weis (Vincent Kartheiser) whose holdings can only be measured in eons; so completely is time on the side of the wealthy that they have truly become the idle rich. Will also eyes Weis daughter Sylvia (Seyfried) a spoiled girl constantly surrounded by bodyguards who just might possess a hitherto unstirred rebellious streak. Before long Niccol morphs In Time into a yarn that borrows liberally from Robin Hood and Bonnie and Clyde as Will and Sylvia race around determined to steal from the rich and give to the poor. They are pursued not only by ""timekeeper"" cop Leon (Cillian Murphy) whos spent years enforcing the system while pointedly staying alive only on a per diem but by the menacing ""Minute Men""--or in another filmmakers phrase time bandits--thieves led by a wacko (Alex Pettyfer) who enjoys draining his victims of their last remaining seconds. The films themes presciently merge with the ""haves/have-nots"" disparities behind the current Wall Street occupation and related protests and the desperate couple-against-the-world set-up has an enduring appeal. Unfortunately as the film moves along its brisk pace notwithstanding too many issues come to weigh against it. As cleverly conceived as it is the time-for-money substitution leaves a lot of questions unanswered. Other than for Leon and a few flunkies there are no authority figures visible or alluded to. Who runs the country the city? Is the rest of the world like this? How did the aging process get halted? Given so remarkable an achievement why are there no other comparable technological advances? Why are all the cars customized early 1960s Lincoln Continentals Jags and Cadillacs? Speaking of the 1960s one of the films most arresting touches it to give Seyfried face-framing hair thats straight Anna Karina/Brigitte Bardot/Elsa Martinelli circa 1963. Its a great look for Seyfried who gets to pout a lot early on before joining forces with the boy from the other side of town. All the same the couple doesnt generate much heat which speaks to a greater shortcoming As it centers on lovers who throw all caution to the wind to live intensely for a time on behalf of a cause greater than themselves the story desperately needed to be told with urgency in a free-wheeling vital lyrical style with a fatalistic overlay something achieved in films such as Bonnie and Clyde Pierrot le fou and Thelma and Louise for starters. Niccols approach is too grounded and prosaic for such a spirit to take hold either with the camera or the actors who run a lot but never together in a way that conveys their resolute connection. A more exalted even delirious musical score would also have raised the stakes. Timberlake capably carries the film but a glint of true rebelliousness of a slightly unhinged element in his characters makeup could have nudged the performance to another level. Seyfried too would have benefited from being further pushed. That everyone looks terrific is part of the point but Murphy is able to provide a welcome suggestion that his character has seen it all and is wearing down while Kartheisers baby-faced visage and amused smile supply an extra layer of delight. Working within the tight conceptual frame ace cinematographer Roger Deakins enhances the real Los Angeles locations (including the CAA office building which serves as Kartheisers headquarters) as well as the creations of production designer Alex McDowell and costume designer Colleen Atwood.
