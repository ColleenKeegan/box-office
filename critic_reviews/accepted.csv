His conjuring gifts (an orange tree -- complete with lush fruit -- sprouts out of an empty vessel a handkerchief is borne on the wings of butterflies) bring down the house every night. But it isnt only the hoi polloi who are filling the seats of the theater. The swinish Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell) is in the audience one night with his lovely companion Sophie (Jessica Biel). Also present Leopolds fixer Uhl (Paul Giamatti) the citys ambitious and corrupt chief of police (as well as the movies narrator) who is fascinated by Eisenheim. ENLARGE Leopold has reason to dislike Eisenheim to want him shut down Uhls background check on the magician reveals a childhood friendship with Sophie a relationship subsequently renewed. The prince has reason to ramp up his animus when Eisenheim recklessly uses magic to mortify him at a party and then makes off with his girl. As Leopold makes brutally clear Sophie will be his or no ones. And as Eisenheim makes equally clear in a specially fashioned new edition of his show one that features visitors from the great beyond Leopold will pay dearly for his misdeeds. The heart of ""The Illusionist"" which is based on a short story by Steven Millhauser is the cat-and-mouse game between Uhl and Eisenheim (its certainly more diverting than the romance between Eisenheim and Sophie; blame Ms. Biels bovine performance). But Mr. Giamatti doing his very best to channel Claude Rains in ""Casablanca"" never appears quite as wily as he ought to be. Or maybe he is. Its important to keep in mind that little in ""The Illusionist"" is quite what it seems. That goes for the movie itself fashioned from smoke mirrors and fortunately Mr. Nortons magical performance. The ludicrous climax full of run-that-by-me-again flashbacks delivered at Keystone-cop speed -- oh if only he could make that disappear. Trust the Man Marriage it has been said is frequently like a besieged fortress Everyone inside wants to get out; everyone outside wants to get in. So it is with the characters in the listless dull-witted romantic comedy ""Trust the Man."" ENLARGE Offbeat in-laws Billy Crudup and David Duchovny in Trust the Man. Tom (David Duchovny who on the large screen is so insubstantial a presence he doesnt seem to have a shadow) is a Manhattan advertising exec turned stay-at-home dad. To be fair it isnt exactly that David wants out of marriage to his actress wife Rebecca (Julianne Moore). But a little time-out would be nice a little time out on the town. To be blunt he wants sex. Is that so wrong? Twice a day as the horrified Rebecca confides to the shrink (Gary Shandling in a regrettably brief cameo) during a once-yearly session of couples therapy. But as Tom counters Rebecca never wants to have sex. Well hardly ever. When she isnt too busy shes too tired. By comparison that pretty divorcee Tom keeps seeing when he picks his son up at school seems very willing and very eager -- and adventuresome. In another part of town Rebeccas directionless brother Tobey (Billy Crudup) spends his days fretting over the inevitability of death and in accordance with Manhattan parking rules moving his car from one side of the street to the other. Meanwhile his life is idling in neutral. This is more than a little vexing to his longtime girlfriend Elaine (the ever-so-appealing Maggie Gyllenhaal) an aspiring novelist who wants a commitment. The biological clock and all that. Tick tock. Tick tock. Zzzzzzzzz. Sorry I must have drifted off there for a second. ""Trust the Man"" which was written and directed by Bart Freundlich (Ms. Moores husband) does not bring a single fresh inventive idea to the table -- unless one counts a supposedly madcap scene at a sex addicts meeting or the supposedly farcical sight of Tom readying himself for a long delayed night of connubial passion being forced to perform the Heimlich maneuver instead. The movie shows its form -- and ancestry -- early. The opening montage is a poor imitation of the one that began Woody Allens ""Manhattan."" Mr. Crudups existential funk (well it would be a funk if it were a bit more energetic) is similarly wan Woody borrowed from ""Hannah and Her Sisters"" while the debate about the frequency of Tom and Rebeccas sex life during a therapy session is right out of the ""Annie Hall"" playbook. The gravely beautiful Ms. Moore looks terribly uncomfortable here. Comedy never seems to suit her anyway. But her co-stars dont fare much better. This is what happens when you trust the wrong man. Accepted Pity high-school seniors. They struggle for years spend weekends prepping for the SATs and grovel for recommendations. They worry about their futures. And what do they get for their angst rejection letters and with them the knowledge that other kids with lesser credentials are in at the college of their choice. ENLARGE Justin Long (left) and Jonah Hill in the college comedy Accepted. Pity Hollywood screenwriters. They struggle for years spend weekends at seminars purporting to teach the fine points of plotting and character development and grovel for introductions to the secretary of the best friend of a junior agent. They worry about their futures. And what do they get for their angst rejection letters and with them the knowledge that other writers with crummier scripts are in at the studio of their choice. To take just one example the bone-headed script for ""Accepted."" Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long) has spent most of his 18 years gaming the education system. But now the jig is up. He applied to eight colleges. All of them including his safety school regret to inform him...thanks but no thanks. His livid parents take exactly zero comfort in the fact that Albert Einstein Lewis amp; Clark and Suzanne Somers never got a sheepskin either. Whats a guy to do with Mom and Dad on his back? Get together with some other university rejects create a spiffy Web site and conjure up their own college -- in this case the South Harmon Institute of Technology. Such is typical of the (you should pardon the expression) sophomoric humor of ""Accepted."" Bartleby and his friends turn an abandoned psychiatric facility into a Potemkin Village of higher education complete with a bombastic dean (Lewis Black). Bartlebys parents buy in and hand their freshman a check to cover the first semesters tuition barely taking note of the bars on the windows. The student population balloons when others stumble on the ""acceptance is just a click away"" South Harmon Web site. Together these merry misfits fashion their own curriculum and of course thrive until they attract the ire of their supposed ""sister school"" the strait-laced Harmon University -- and the state accreditation board. The comic possibilities are many the execution perfunctory the anti-intellectual bias stunning. Go right ahead and skip this one at the Cineplex. Youve got my word It wont be on the final.    DVD TIP You know what were gonna do? Toga Party Such was the rallying cry of the 1978 anarchic comedy ""Animal House"" starring John Belushi as Bluto Blutarsky the summa cum lewdest member of Delta fraternity. Joe Morgenstern is on vacation. His column will return on Friday Sept. 8.

""Accepted"" will be released in theaters on August 11 2006. Photo Credit Suzanne Hanover / Univer Cant get into college? Dont stress. Just make one up with your friends. 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Accepted Comedy. Starring Justin Long Jonah Hill Blake Lively and Lewis Black. Directed by Steve Pink. (PG-13. 93 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Accepted"" is the perfect comedy for moviegoers who prefer not to think too much. The plot exists in an alternate reality where theres no such thing as a junior college  actor Justin Long is about a decade too old to play his high school graduate character and wild coincidence always trumps logic when its time to move the story forward. But if you can lighten up for an hour and a half the film delivers one good laugh after another. The one-liners and visual gags are mostly successful and the lovable dorks and misfits in supporting roles are uniformly excellent. Much of ""Accepted"" is ludicrous but even when the screenwriters and actors are insulting your intelligence they have the courtesy to be consistently funny. The hardest part is getting through the first 15 minutes. Remember all those ""Friends"" and ""Beverly Hills 90210"" episodes where everyones plans fall through so the whole gang can spend Thanksgiving together? ""Accepted"" does the same thing except with a group of high schoolers who suddenly have their college plans dashed and have to find a last-minute alternative. The first act improves once Bartleby (Long) and his friends set up the fictional South Harmon Institute of Technology -- by buying a condemned psychiatric hospital with the tuition money that their parents think is going to a legitimate college. (""I hope you have hobo stab insurance"" one of the schemers jokes before another declares the location ""the birthplace of crack."") Steve Pink who wrote ""High Fidelity"" and ""Grosse Pointe Blank"" makes his directorial debut and he makes the most of what looks like maybe a 3 million budget. Much like ""Office Space"" and last years underrated ""Waiting ..."" his limitations become sort of an advantage because everyone seems to be focusing on the one thing that doesnt cost money delivering good lines. Even though the plot is a blunt tool the comedy is inventive. Take the name of the school which is an acronym for a common profanity. Its a running joke that should get old quick but the writers and cast keep finding ways to make it funny again. For example the mascot is a sandwich. (Think about it for a minute. It will come to you.) Long has one of those weird metabolisms where he perpetually looks as if hes 22 then when he turns 55 hell suddenly look as if hes 70. (The same thing happened to Paul Simon and is going to happen to Bob Costas next March.) But hes a solid anchor in a movie with mostly one-note characters. Lewis Black is great as a burnout ex-professor who becomes the schools dean and Blake Lively is sufficiently lovely as Bartlebys love interest. ""Accepted"" isnt the next ""Animal House"" but it definitely could qualify as the next ""PCU"" which still makes it better than 85 percent of the comedies aimed at this demographic. -- Advisory This film contains profanity comic violence and scantily clad women. ""Accepted"" is fine for most teens although the content may be disturbing for high school seniors who didnt pick a safety school.

His parents being judgmental and mean furrow their brows and announce that hes wasting his life even after Bartleby asserts (not quite correctly) that neither Einstein nor Pocahontas -- neither Lewis nor Clark -- neither Corey Feldman nor Corey Haim -- ever attended college. Bent on redemption Bartleby does what any frustrated high school senior would do which is invent a college With the help of his enabling friends he drums up a fake Web site and letterhead for the South Harmon Institute of Technology (check out the acronym) ""one of the most respected schools in the area."" The ruse works. His parents being stupid as well as judgmental and mean write him a tuition check for 10000. With this mad money Bartleby and his pals rent a decrepit psychiatric hospital and renovate it speedy-quick into a natty college campus so perfect it manages to snow not only Bartlebys parents but also the hordes of would-be students who show up bags in hand for the first day of school. Armed with the resultant piles of money and an equal supply of chutzpah Bartleby does what any charming young charlatan would do which is Engage in wholesale fraud All those tuition checks go toward funky interior decorating (a clap-on disco ball) and a revolutionary student-directed curriculum that encompasses anything anyone feels like doing. This includes skateboarding lolling about a pool in bikinis meditating sculpting elephantine fertility figures whipping up spectacular mixed drinks rocking out at par-tays and in the words of one student ""learning how to blow (acronym) up with my mind."" Coolness on all counts. Accepted stars the always-amiable Justin Long (The Break-Up) as Bartleby and benefits from a doofus supporting cast that includes Adam Herschman as an addled aspiring chef; Jonah Hill (Click) as Bartlebys best friend Schrader; and the forcibly acerbic Lewis Black as Schraders Uncle Ben a soured academic who preaches against the Man from his perch as the schools lone paid faculty member. Directed by High Fidelity co-writer Steve Pink Accepted is one part Animal House one part Mr. Smith Goes to Washington one part Ferris Buellers Day Off and two parts Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland musical in which the kids say ""Hey lets put on an experimental institute of higher learning"" instead of a show. The screenplay -- by three whose credits include Herbie Fully Loaded and New York Minute -- employs bits of sparky dialogue and a laid-back anti-establishment vibe that gives the film some juice. But too much of the plot is eaten up with cliched assaults on a stodgy mainstream college and its pretty gel-afflicted frat boys who care waaayyy less about the liberal arts than whacking around pledges with a wooden spanker. Its worth nothing that Accepteds spurious college is not the first school real or imagined to boast that particular acronym which appeared on an episode of The Simpsons as the Springfield Heights Institute of Technology. Its also one of West Points more disparaging nicknames (the South Hudson ... ). But as far as I know its the first place so named to put lap-dancing on the curriculum. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Sony Heavy Duty Zinc AA Battery 120-Pack for 25 + free shipping KitchenAid Small Kitchen Appliances at eBay Up to 51% off +...

"Accepted Old college try falls flat - USATODAY.com SearchHow do I find it?Subscribe to paper Home News Travel Money Sports Life Tech Weather Movies Cars  Event tickets   Jobs Real estate  Shop   Online degrees ABOUT THE MOVIEAccepted  (out of four)Director Steve Pink Stars Justin Long Blake Lively Lewis BlackDistributor Universal Pictures Rating PG-13 for sexual material and drug content Running time 1 hour 30 minutes Opens Friday nationwide ALSO OPENING THIS WEEKENDMaterial Girls Hilary and Haylie Duff star as glamorous heiress sisters who lose their fortune when the family business is ruined. After some self-indulgence they save the company. (Rated PG for language and rude humor. Running time 97 minutes). Opens nationwide Friday. Accepted Old college try falls flat Updated 8/18/2006 918 AM ET E-mail | Print | By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Accepted is trying to be a new species of Animal House but at least that 1978 comedy had no pretensions of being more than a boisterous spoof of college life. Feebly Accepted tries to lampoon academia and the increasingly fraught college application process. Those are worthy targets for satire but this isnt a subversive movie. Mostly it wallows in partying with a capital P. When Bartleby (Justin Long) is rejected by every college he applies to he invents a school simply to appease his parents. But the realistic website for South Harmon Institute of Technology (the acronym is a joke thats beaten to death) ends up attracting rejects and misfits. Oddly the film embodies the paradox of youth culture Teens are increasingly pressured to excel particularly when it comes to college. But they also have an extraordinary sense of entitlement and a fascination with materialism. So its not surprising that when these kids apply their ingenuity to creating a fake college what they develop is a place where self-indulgence runs rampant and classes include ""How to be a Rock Star"" and ""Babe Watching."" Long is the films saving grace. He has a likable young Tom Hanks quality and one can imagine an impressive career ahead of him. Too bad he took this time off for bad behavior.

"Accepted is a crude yet charming comedy - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW College rejection gets laughs in Accepted By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  August 18 2006 The dog days of August were made for good-natured cinematic swill and ``Accepted"" a rude crude engagingly slap-happy campus comedy was made for August. That applies whether you catch it in theaters this weekend or stumble across it in December on pay-cable. Low of brow and pure of heart the movie plays like ``Animal House"" extra-lite and as such its decent indecent fun.It helps -- a lot -- that Justin Long is in the lead as perennially underachieving college wannabe Bartleby ``B . "" Gaines. Long has played sweet-faced doofi in movies such as ``Dodgeball"" ``The Break-Up"" and ``Waiting . . ."" (in which he almost made that movies nasty jokes palatable) but you probably know him as the smug Mac guy in those Mac vs . PC ads. Dont hold that against him; in ``Accepted"" Long comes across as David Schwimmer with a spine and a plan.Bartleby is such a screw-up that he hasnt been accepted at any of the eight colleges to which he has applied. Hes also so resourceful that he cooks up a way to keep his tightly wound father (Mark Derwin) from hitting the roof; if most of his classmates are attending the snooty Harmon University nearby hell invent a college that will accept him. With some brainstorming and Web wizardry the South Harmon Institute of Technology is born. If you havent noticed what the schools acronym spells out ``Accepted"" is happy to remind you. Over and over.Thats the one labored gag in a comedy that successfully walks the thin line between stoopid and stupid. The ruse gets out of control Dad wants to visit the campus so B. finds an abandoned mental hospital and turns it into a viable (more or less) college with the help of his equally unmatriculated friends injured jock Hands (Columbus Short) weirdo Glen (Adam Herschman) and Ivy League reject Rory (Maria Thayer). They need a dean so failed college professor and borderline lunatic Uncle Ben (comedian Lewis Black) is commandeered.Then the rest of the students arrive -- all 500 of them. It turns out the South Harmon website has kicked out acceptance letters like spam and B. is now the administrator of a school that doesnt exist. His student body is a police line up of surfers ex-strippers ADD basket cases and thugs. The curriculum? Whatever you want it to be man. There are classes in ``Slacking 101"" ``Men The Weaker Sex"" and ``The Decline and Fall of Chevy Chase"" (ouch). Its like the hippie educational ideal of the 60s channel ed through ``Porkys.""A movie like this has to have WASPy meanies and over at Harmon University theres the vile Dean Van Horn (Anthony Heald) and his fratboy minion Hoyt Ambrose (Travis Van Winkle) respectively standing in for Dean Wormer and Greg Marmalard of ``Animal House."" B.s best friend a hopeless social freak named Sherman (Jonah Hill) takes on Stephen Fursts old ``Flounder"" role.Meanwhile Hoyts girlfriend the beauteous Monica (Blake Lively) is enough of a free spirit that shes quickly drawn across town to South Harmon and to B. and theres never any doubt as to where the movie in general is heading an appearance before the college accreditation committee and the chance for Bartleby to say things like ``Its not just about us anymore""If the jokes are sloppy and the characters generic director Steve Pink keeps the genial vibe going for longer than he has any right to. (Pink wrote ``High Fidelity"" and ``Grosse Point Blank"" and effectively steps down a few rungs here so he can step up into the directors chair.) ``Accepted"" trots out a few timid notions about breaking open the stifling university model but rebellion is the last thing on anyones mind. Like all Hollywood youth comedies about nonconformity its conformist at heart; unlike most of the others it puts a crass smile on your face while playing it safe.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

The story centers on one Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long) a charming yet oddly pratfall-prone adolescent con artist who staring at eight rejected college applications whips up a fake school with the help of his overachieving bud Sherman (the nicely dry Jonah Hill). But the illusion is too perfect and soon Bartleby has a class of misfits matriculating at his homemade South Harmon Institute of Technology (the acronym if youre wondering is very deliberate) complete with classes like ""Doing Nothing"" and ""Blowing S-- Up With Your Mind."" Naturally a showdown brews between the dream-chasing slackers and monolithic overstructured Harmon University which breeds nothing but ""stress freaks and caffeine addicts."" At this point goofball subversion begins to mosh uncomfortably with sermonizing love-in and Patch Adams Goes to College nearly breaks out. Accepteds winning dumbness and breezy bons mots save it from the pit but one wonders In an age when a petulant ""Its hard"" excuses the grossest failures and all of us the Establishment especially are rewarded for playing by our own rules how do you separate the true rebels from the rejects?

This glibly amusing paean to coed slackerdom may get docked some B.O. credits due to its late summer release from Universal. Acceptable as a slab of teen-targeted summer fare ""Accepted"" is a cheerfully implausible underdog comedy about several college rejects who invent a phony alma mater only to find themselves paying way more than just tuition. Conceived in the same authority-defying loser-uniting vein as a mainstream Richard Linklater picture this glibly amusing paean to coed slackerdom may get docked some B.O. credits due to its late summer release from Universal -- opposite (gulp) ""Snakes on a Plane"" -- though youth biz should be brisk enough before it graduates into the world of homevid. Clocking in at a weightless but far from witless 92 minutes snappily executed pic reps the feature helming debut of Steve Pink who co-wrote the John Cusack vehicles ""Grosse Pointe Blank"" and ""High Fidelity."" ""Accepted"" penned by the team of Adam Cooper Bill Collage and Mark Perez has a similarly slick way with dialogue while its hyper-articulate hero suggests a younger prototype of one of Cusacks fast-talking charmers. Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long the gangly and likeable thesp from ""Dodgeball"" and ""The Break-Up"") is an Ohio teenager with lousy grades but a quicksilver ability to B.S. his way out of any situation. Faced with social ostracism and the disappointment of his parents (Mark Derwin and Ann Cusack) after being rejected by every college he applied to Bartleby drafts a fake acceptance letter to the South Harmon Institute of Technology the equally fake ""sister school"" of the illustrious Harmon College. He even talks his best friend Sherman (Jonah Hill) a rotund nerd whos set to begin classes at Harmon College in the fall into building a snazzy Web site for the phony institute. When his parents insist on visiting the campus Bartleby goes to ridiculously desperate lengths to maintain the illusion obtaining the deed to a long-abandoned mental hospital (""Hope you have hobo stab insurance"" Sherman mutters in one of the scripts better lines) dressing it up as a place of higher learning and tapping Shermans weird Uncle Ben (Lewis Black gleefully off his rocker) to play the dean. Joining Bartleby in this massive undertaking are fellow rejects Hands (Columbus Short) whose recent injury cost him an athletic scholarship; Rory (Maria Thayer) a Yale reject who neglected to apply anywhere else; and Glen (Adam Herschman) an all-around weirdo whose future looks to consist of a series of fast-food counters. But with the exception of Sherman who benefits from Hills sharp timing none of Bartlebys friends emerges as a memorable second fiddle. Things get even more out of hand when hundreds of flakes freaks and former strippers find out about South Harmon and manage to gain admission via an online loophole. Forced to improvise Bartleby and friends come up with the ultimate liberal education in which lounging skateboarding and nonstop partying are treated as serious subjects and students are encouraged to think for themselves (or not at all). Providing a stiff contrast is Harmon College whose rigidly traditionalist dean (snide bad guy extraordinaire Anthony Heald) sends golden boy Hoyt Ambrose (Travis Van Winkle) to investigate South Harmon. Hoyt is also head of a Harmon fraternity allowing pic to take a high and mighty attitude toward hazing rituals while planting the requisite seed of longing between Bartleby and Hoyts girlfriend Monica (Blake Lively). Helmer Pink maintains a fluid pace and keeps the zingers flying so rapidly that the numerous plotholes -- where does everyone sleep? How could the creative masterminds behind such a charade not have gotten into college? -- nag only in retrospect. Even a running gag about the schools groan-worthy initials pays consistent comic dividends. As a misfit-empowering comedy that embraces the stragglers and fringe-dwellers of teen society ""Accepted"" is sweetly amusing gently anarchic and never mean-spirited. But as it winds toward its final showdown between South Harmon and a state accreditation board its attempts to make an inspiring grand statement about mediocrity as a legitimate form of personal expression feel awfully threadbare. Like Bartleby the script has a talent for making hooey sound good. But pic falters when it begs to be taken seriously especially when its portrayal of Harmon as a soul-deadening preppy wasteland tips over into sanctimony. Long continues to cement his status as an improbably reliable leading man carrying the comedy effortlessly with his extended verbal flights of fancy. Well-chosen locations are nonetheless a far cry from Ohio Orange Countys Chapman U. stood in for Harmon while South Harmon exteriors were shot at a veterans affairs hospital in Northridge Calif.
