"Review The Simpsons Movie delivers - CNN.com Review The Simpsons Movie deliversStory Highlights Tom Charity ""Simpsons Movie"" like a good longer episode of show Plot Homer gets family in trouble moves to Alaska more trouble Best parts involve pokes at authority figures Next Article in Entertainment >> Read VIDEO INTERACTIVE INTERACTIVE By Tom Charity Special to CNN (CNN) -- After 18 years and 400 episodes of a show that refuses to grow old ""The Simpsons"" finally graduates to a movie theater near you. It doesnt take Homer long (about two minutes) to ask the obvious question What kind of sucker pays for something he can watch at home for free? To escape troubles in Springfield Homer Simpson moves to Alaska -- which brings other problems. Thankfully this is the last time the thought will intrude on what proves to be a smooth and assured transition. Clocking in at just under an hour and a half ""The Simpsons Movie"" is basically a bumper edition of the show; bigger longer and uncut. (Newsflash We get a passing glimpse of Barts manhood after Homer double-dares him to skateboard through Springfield butt naked.) Fans will be relieved mostly. And latecomers should get an idea of why this rudely sketched animated sitcom inspires such widespread devotion. At its best ""The Simpsons"" is as cruel a satire on American culture -- or the lack of it -- as anything on prime time. Producer James L. Brooks negotiated creative independence from the Fox network and over the years creator Matt Groening and the shows writers havent been shy to bite the hand that feeds them. Indolent blue-collar imbecile Homer may not be a model citizen or a working-class hero but you have to look next door at his squarely middle-class born-again neighbor Ned Flanders to find where the slap invariably sticks. Interactive ""Simpsons"" 101 >> Not this time though. Evidently convinced that the key to sustaining a motion picture is in the liberal use of epiphanies Brooks Groening and company kick things off with Grampa Abraham Simpson getting a divine revelation a message from God right in the midst of Holy Communion (""Terrible things are going to happen ..."") This warning seems to refer to an impending environmental catastrophe and/or Homer pigging out with his new pet porker. Either way it goes unheeded by the nominal head of the family whose concern for the earths resources rarely extends beyond his next doughnut. When it comes time to dispose of his pigs waste Homer takes it over to Lake Springfield. Dont Miss Groening No end in sight for Simpsons I-Report  What you love about The Simpsons Meanwhile perhaps cowed by his public humiliation and jealous of the hog son Bart begins to draw unflattering comparisons between Homer and Flanders. Even wife Marge has had enough after Homers made it clear he cares more about his own yellow skin than the good folk of Springfield. After all the latter are doomed by the overzealous response of President Schwarzeneggers Environmental Protection Agency which plans to turn the towns toxic embarrassment into a new improved Grand Canyon ... eventually. The show has ventured beyond hometown security before of course but its usually sharper on the micro domestic squabbles neighborly feuds and the petty prevarications of municipal authority figures. Lets face it the Homer Simpsons of this world have no curiosity for anything beyond the remote control so its a stretch when he pulls a poster of Alaska out of his back pocket and promises a fresh start. The family hightails it out of Springfield and almost immediately the movie loses some of its sparkle. Homers odyssey gives the picture epic scope no doubt but its a pity several well-loved supporting characters are reduced to bit-part status as a result and dare we suggest his redemptive transformation from pathetic Every-jerk to mock action hero is a teensy bit tired? Thats not to say ""The Simpsons Movie"" doesnt have plenty of laughing gas left in its tank. But those hilarious opening 20 minutes remind us how far this wickedly funny animated series pushed the sitcom format toward an inspired anarchic subversion. The movie settles for something more conventional so maybe those claims ""The Simpsons"" has aged some have a point. Nevertheless nobody should have a cow. Bigger and longer dont always mean better but ""The Simpsons Movie"" is still a cut above. ""The Simpsons Movie"" is rated PG-13 and runs 85 minutes. For Entertainment Weeklys take click here.

"Simpsons gleeful film debut | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesSimpsons gleeful film debutFreed from TVs constraints of commercials and running time The Simpsons big-screen debut is both humbly scaled and securely in its groove.By Geoff PevereEntertainment ColumnistFri. July 27 2007Featuring the voices of Dan Castellaneta Julie Kavner Nancy Cartwright Yeardley Smith Hank Azaria Harry ShearerWritten by Matt Groening James L. Brooks Sam Simon. Directed by David Silverman. 87 minutes. At major theatres. PGBy sticking to a formula that suggests a prime time episode sprung from the constraints of commercials and a 20-plus minute running time Homers big-screen debut is both humbly scaled and securely in its groove. It may preach safely to the converted but theres almost no room left in the church anyway.Opening with an Itchy and Scratchy episode that climaxes with the nuclear obliteration of the moon The Simpsons Movie gleefully takes the pee out of blockbuster expectations and bovine audience loyalties. After dismissing the cartoon lunar apocalypse as ""boring"" Homer turns on us ""suckers"" for paying to see what we could watch for free at home. Article Continued BelowBefore we have time to ponder the truth of that charge - and prior to delving into a plot which sees the toxically endowed community of Springfield capped by a giant EPA-issued dome - director David Silverman treats us to something we cant see on TV a glimpse of Barts aptly-named ""doodle"" as he skateboards naked through town as payment on a wager lost to the obliviously abusive Homer. That single gesture to non-prime time impropriety notwithstanding The Simpsons Movie sticks largely to the programs more well-established objects of ridicule the crazed consumerism and hypocrisy at the core of contemporary life and the conviction that nothing is more impervious to the forces of catastrophe or enlightenment than sheer stupidity. Thats why a millennium or so from now The Simpsons will still be on the air and Homer will have replaced his Greek namesake as a figure of classical significance.After seemingly falling in love with a pig Homer packs the animals vile ""leavings"" in a conspicuously phallic silo he promptly dumps in the local water system. Generating an environmental crisis that not only flouts daughter Lisas series of do-gooder lectures called ""An Irritating Truth"" but brings the wrath of President Schwarzeneggers Environment Protection Agency in the form of a giant Plexiglas lid Homer escapes with his family to a libelously maligned Alaska before waking up to some dim semblance of civic responsibility. Will he save the day? Are you kidding? Does stupid ever surrender?Animated in a refreshingly throwback CGI-shunning 2-D fashion that suggests the TV show enhanced by a modest trust fund The Simpsons Movie often seems almost impervious to its unusual status as big-screen spectacle. But thats ultimately part of the pleasure. Some 10 years after expected The Simpsons Movie couldnt give a doodle in a doughnut hole about expectations anyway. It may deliver what weve already got but it leaves no doubt why we got it in the first place.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"The Simpsons Movie reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Simpsons Movie reviewed. The Simpsons Movie reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 27 2007 1134 AM Enter the Donut The Simpsons Movie reviewed. By Dana Stevens The Simpsons Movie The Simpsons Movie is as hard to critique as it is to resist. Thats because after 18 years we are all Simpsons now How many days can you go without at least mentally quoting an episode whether its Monty Burns finger-steepling ""Exxx-cellent"" or Homers glazed-eyed trance at the sight of a donut? The shows irreverent reference-packed satire has shaped the sense of humor of an entire generation. And the closest thing we have to an American national archetype is The Simpsons pudgy paterfamilias greedy blundering and hopelessly dense but well-meaning and tirelessly optimistic. Homer Simpson cest nous. And like us hes a sucker for a good marketing campaign. ""I cant believe were paying to see something we can get on TV for free"" Homer whines in the opening framesas the family takes in a big-screen version of The Itchy and Scratchy Show. Ha. The Simpsons Movie starts small with story lines that echo old episodes Lisa canvasses the town to save Springfield Lake from pollution. Grandpa goes nuts and begins prophesying in church. Homer rescues a pig from slaughter bonding with it so deeply that he drives the jealous Bart to seek solace with neighbor Ned Flanders. It isnt until Homer breaks the law by dumping his silo of pig droppings into the lake (""That could be anybodys pig crap silo"" he protests when the deed is exposed) that Springfield officially becomes the most toxic place on planet Earth. The evil EPA chief Russ Cargill (voiced by Albert Brooks) convinces President Arnold Schwarzenegger to seal off the entire city with an impenetrable glass dome (manufactured conveniently by Cargill Domes). Advertisement A long middle section in which the family escapes to Alaska sags a bit (which is to say the joke density drops from one laugh per second to one every five or six seconds). But when they make it back to Springfield which has by now slipped into Lord of the Flies-style anarchy and been targeted for nuclear annihilation by Cargill the pace picks up as Homer saves the day the only way he knows how by making one incredibly poor choice after another. This last sequence with its shots of the vast transparent dome covering the city is one of the few that takes advantage of the possibilities offered by the big-screen format. Visually most of The SimpsonsMovie could have come straight from a TV episode but those who share the Comic Book Guys love for old-school animation will be fine with the choice to keep things flat wonky and minimally drawn. But the movie does seize its theatrical opportunity to sneak in a bit of what Krusty the Clown would call ""blue material."" Otto the bus driver smokes a bowl. Marge curses. And Bart has both a drunk scene and a few seconds of full-frontal nudity. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The real difficulty in translating the show to film was how to maintain the pacing of a compact three-act sitcom for the length of a feature. The solution arrived at by a group of 11 veteran writers of the show including creator Matt Groening was to keep it short. At 85 minutes The Simpsons Movie takes less time than viewing four shows back-to-back. And even if none of those four rise to the level of the best TV episodes--""Whacking Day"" say or ""Cape Feare""--theres one sight gag involving Moes Bar thats as timeless a piece of social criticism as Homers classic axiom about alcohol which he once called ""the cause of and solution to all our problems."" Nearly all of the shows minor supporting characters--Moe Szyslak Cletus the Slack-Jawed Yokel Hans Moleman--get to make at least an appearance though it would have been nice to see larger speaking roles for favorites like Apu and Mr. Smithers. Also Sideshow Bob could have had the decency to break out of prison for at least a cursory attempt on Barts life. I guess they have to save something for the sequel.

Elizabeth Weitzman Friday July 27 2007 400 AM The Simpsons Movie. TVs most dysfunctional animated family has to save Springfield from environmental disaster. Director David Silverman (128). PG-13 Irreverent humor. At the start of ""The Simpsons Movie"" Homer (voiced by Dan Castellaneta) admonishes us for paying to see something we could have gotten at home for free. He has a point since the movie is at heart little more than an oversize episode. On the other hand would you really take advice from Homer Simpson? Here after all is what youll miss if you dont leave the couch 1.The devilishly revealed sight of Bart (Nancy Cartwright) naked. 2. The long-awaited location of Springfield. 3. The carefully chosen moment when Maggie finally speaks. 4. A very funny solidly entertaining movie that despite its unshakable obsesion with undergarments is as sweet as a Kwik-E-Mart Squishee. Anyone hoping for an epic satire like ""South Park Bigger Longer amp; Uncut"" will be disappointed. But the jokes are sharp the characters comfortably familiar and the story an ideal target for a dizzying range of potshots. Homer and Bart ride a motorcycle. When your movie begins with Itchy and Scratchy tearing the hell out of each other youve got nowhere to go but to church. So although Homer would rather spend the day watching cartoons Marge (Julie Kavner) packs everyone off to services where Grampa has a divine vision of imminent damnation. Homer responds for reasons that make sense only to him by buying a pig. Unfortunately his new pet prompts the very trouble Grampa predicted When Homer disposes of the animals waste in the Springfield lake he triggers an environmental catastrophe. Springfield is immediately slated for destruction and although the family flees Marge insists on returning to help. Homer however is happy with their new life in Alaska and never wants to see America again. (Take it up with him. I passed geography.) But with Marge Lisa (Yeardley Smith) and even Bart pushing him will he finally do the right thing? Longtime fans wont be happy to find most of their favorite supporting characters pushed to the sidelines. (Sideshow Bob? Are you out there?) And while director David Silverman and his 11 writers work hard to keep the momentum going ""The Simpsons Movie"" does follow the same trajectory as ""The Simpsons"" series It begins brilliantly and eventually loses some steam. But every time you check your watch a genius gag whizzes by. (""The U.S. government has lost its credibility so its borrowing some of mine"" declares Tom Hanks in a public service announcement.) And then you remember why the Simpsons are still part of our lives 18 years after they arrived. At their best to quote the Springfield town motto they embiggen us all. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Homer Simpson takes a relaxing ride aboard a wrecking ball in The Simpsons Movie. Photo Matt Groening The Simpsons 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Action Adventure Romance Nudity The Simpsons Movie has it all but you knew it would. You knew didnt you that it would begin with Itchy the mouse goring Scratchy the cat with a flagpole on the surface of the moon? You knew that at some point probably sooner rather than later Homer would dump a silo filled with pig crap into Springfield Lake prompting the Environmental Protection Agency to encase the city in a biodome. You probably even knew that youd catch a wee (rather a wee-wee) glance at Barts naked ""doodle"" while hes skateboarding. Dont worry I havent spoiled all that much of the plot. As anyone knows whos watched any Simpsons at all over the past almost 20 years a lot can happen in the opening minutes. And thats not even counting the death of a major rock band (they play Nearer My God to Thee on a sinking barge) or Lisas slide show of environmental doom ""An Irritating Truth."" The Simpsons Movie is what can I say Homersque Funny and scabrous warm-hearted and rude. Somehow an animated comedy about an ill-shaven and self-absorbed troglodyte has always come across (repeat somehow) as family-affirming no matter how often Homer strangles Bart. The movie (directed by frequent Simpsons helmer David Silverman) draws the usual battle lines and pokes the usual eyes but it makes as clear as ever that this accident-prone fivesome of nutters actually belong together. As Homer says in a rare moment of emotional honesty ""Ive really come to like you guys"" Marge as expected has blue hair and a few streaks of optimism although she gets tough with Homer when she needs to. Bart as expected is up to no good although he agonizes over father-son issues that pitch him toward despair. Lisa as expected is industrious and smart; as a bonus she meets a singing Irish dreamboat. As for baby Maggie she says her first real word (or the first uttered within earshot of her parents) in the closing credits. Wait for it Its ... What else is there? Well what else does The Simpsons usually have? One or two cameos; one or two slaps at political figures; one or two slaps at Disney; one or two meta-winks at itself and the audience (""everybody in this theater is a giant sucker especially YOU""); and a cast of limber comic actors voicing one or 10 characters. Plenty of regulars make appearances from Krusty the Clown to Ned Flanders to the evil-incarnate nuclear power plant owner Mr. Burns. Listen for Albert Brooks as a tyrannical EPA chief. The action moves all over the map and quickly. Homer says ""Doh."" Super glue proves useful. A gag I refuse to give away will change forever how I regard designer coffee drinks. And in the end amid all the mayhem after certain people have staved off certain disaster on certain locales there is smooching. The Simpsons Movie is not the apogee of animated filmmaking. It looks and feels like an elongated episode which it is. After seeing it I did not dance out of the theater in a haze of Simpsons-induced euphoria. But its subversively hilarious as well as strangely touching and it features a scene in which Homer is directed across the landscape by the twin shadows of a womans mountainous chest. To action adventure romance and nudity add huge directional knockers to the list. And really what more could you ask of The Simpsons? I mean other than donuts.

Liam Lacey From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Friday Jul. 27 2007 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Mar. 13 2009 1133PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The Simpsons Movie Directed by David Silverman Written by James L. Brooks Matt Groening Al Jean Ian Maxtone-Graham George Meyer David Mirkin Mike Reiss Mike Scullly Matt Selman John Swartzwelder and Jon Vitt Featuring the voices of Dan Castellaneta Julie Kravner Nancy Cartwright Yeardley Smith Hank Azaria and Harry Shearer Classification PG  Doh-dum. Ambivalence is not usually a response to anything related to The Simpsons the 18-season-long 400-episode television show that in 1999 Time Magazine declared ""the television show of the 20th Century."" (A bit stingy; given the lack of competition from previous centuries the ""best TV show ever"" would have worked.) Matt Groenings stories of an American family has become a cultural lodestar a rare example of witty subversive refreshingly intelligent mass-culture art. For its first four or five years on the air the writing was often brilliant and the long occasionally mediocre stretches since then have been better than 90 per cent of whats on television. So now comes The Simpsons Movie an event that no doubt will be celebrated by the millions of fans of the show simply because it finally exists. Since The Simpsons Movie first began gestation six years ago the script was reportedly rewritten more than 100 times by a team of 11 writers who possibly tried too hard. At best the experience is like watching four back-to-back less-than-vintage Simpsons episodes. Its often clever and silly but rarely inspired and there is nothing remotely necessary about it. If you were to introduce someone to the genius of The Simpsons on the basis of this movie alone he or she would think you deluded. On the positive side its still four back-to-back Simpsons episodes which is still better than most of what either television or the movies have to offer. The best part is the movies 30-minute introductory sequence or Episode One the opening 20 minutes worth of rapid-fire jokes that in a series of short clips promises a bright punchline-drunk time while setting up the larger environmental disaster plot. We start with the Simpson family watching an Itchy and Scratchy movie in the theatre with Homer (Don Castellaneta) complaining ""I cant believe were paying for something we get for free on TV."" Cut to Green Day playing The Simpsons theme on a barge trying to preach an anti-pollution message. Then at a funeral Grandpa Simpson (Castellaneta) begins to ramble incoherently about an upcoming disaster and soon Lisa (Yeardley Smith) is going door-to-door to convince people to clean up the town lake when she meets a dreamboat Irish musician-activist named Colin (Mike Dirnt). We move on to the now already-famous set piece of a naked skate-boarding Bart (Nancy Cartwright) showing his noodle and Homers acquisition of yet-another inappropriate pet a pig who produces enough manure to create an environmental disaster. Then Episode 2 which begins to stumble into a thicket of plot. Over to Washington where the power-mad head of the Environmental Protection Agency (Albert Brooks) convinces President Arnold Schwarzenegger (Harry Shearer) to seal the polluted Springfield under an unbreakable dome. The citizens of Springfield turn on each other and especially the cause of their imprisonment Homer Simpson. The movie manages to include almost every recurring character from the history of the series but ultimately Homers dumbness - the engine of the most obvious episodes - remains the focus here. On to the weakest section episode three in which the Simpson family is taken out of its natural urban environment into the tedium of nature in rural Alaska. Bart has become estranged from his father preferring the unctuous pleasantries of Ned Flanders (Shearer) to Homers inveterate stupidity. Marge (Julie Kravner) once again puts her foot down and decides she cannot tolerate Homers selfishness. Otherwise Alaska offers little for the family to do (one half-hearted polar bear encounter) and soon Marge and the children leave Homer in an attempt to thwart the latest EPA plot against Springfield. Narrative desperation begins to show when Homer finds an Inuit spiritual guide who he calls Boob Lady who helps lead him back to his family. The last act back in the dome with the full cast of Springfield restored is a welcome return to busy noisy life. Many of these elements are familiar. A number of inappropriate pets have entered the Simpson household. Springfield has previously been threatened with destruction (by an asteroid in Barts Comet Season 6) bringing out the worst and best in its population. Homer has previously had a spiritual mentor (Johnny Cash as Coyote in Season Eight). All these elements emphasize how much The Simpsons Movie aims to be a recapitulation of proven successes instead of breaking new creative ground. After the big-screen success of a rival animated series 1999s South Park Bigger Longer and Uncut this safe strategy seems needlessly gutless. Television comedy writing typically surpasses that of the movies and for years The Simpsons staff has been the cream of the form. Theres a undeniably high level of craft here especially from the peerless voice cast and there are moments of inspiration - including a smart cameo from Tom Hanks oddball visual references - that from lesser talents might look like gems. But this isnt supposed to be a typical contemporary family movie in which the narrative serves as the centre of a cross-promotional campaign with TV theme park fast food and toy corporations.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post All we ever wanted from ""The Simpsons Movie"" is that it be just like the TV show. Only longer. The good news? It is. The bad news? The movie constitutes the only three new TV episodes youll get until September. Doh ""The Simpsons Movie"" is 80 gloriously unkempt uninterrupted minutes of sight gags audio gags animation gags and well just plain gagging. The plot centers on Homers untidy disposal of an entire silo of pig gaggings and deteriorates from there. So crack open a Duff and enjoy the usual with Moe and the gang. The Simpsons concept in feature length is just as reassuringly startling in its nonstop irreverence as the best of the weekly TV droppings. You dont like the TV show you say? Then why in the world are you reading this? Did you expect the movie version to be a subtitled fusion of a Jane Austen novel and a Jim Jarmusch film narrated by Meryl Streep? Homer is as Homer always was. So it is written and so it shall be burped in pig-Latin. And why do we love this show after 18 seasons and a 19th already story-boarded for the fall? It could be democracy that Homers town of Springfield encourages all points of view to be expressed so that each might be exposed to equal beer-scented ridicule. It could be superiority - my 3-year-old could draw animation better than that and he certainly wouldnt choose that steroidal-yellow skin color. Or it could be affinity - all our families would be like the Simpsons if all our families were belligerent drunk destitute evangelistic sadistic billionaires with day jobs in illegal nuclear waste disposal child endangerment and fraudulent convenience store management. Me I like the doughnuts with Springfield being the last place on Earth that admits to mass consumption of the little arterial plugs. Chief Wiggum strings a few maple crullers on his pistol barrel with the expected result in both caloric consumption and gunpowder residue. I appreciate a cartoon that goes straight over the top and down the cliff waiting on the other side. Whats most evident in such a long Simpsons jam session is how many varieties of jokes the large roomful of writers tends to employ with no discernible pattern but predictably funny results. Satire mixed with homage? How about Disneys forest bluebirds undressing Marge and Homer for a scene that will consummate just off-camera? Political riffs? How about Lisas lecture on environmental threats titled ""An Irritating Truth""? Vaudeville? ""Hes mad with power."" ""Ever tried going mad without power? Its boring and nobody listens to you."" The first joke though is on the idiots in the audience - that would be you and to a lesser extent because theres no charge at press viewings me. A random ""Itchy amp; Scratchy"" episode plays on screen then we pull back to see Homer and Bart in a movie theater. ""I cant believe were paying for something we can get on TV for free"" Homer rants. With Bart writing 100 times ""I will not illegally download this movie"" - eat my shorts Rupert Murdoch - were on our way. Lisas quest is to purge Springfield of its latest Superfund site. Marges quest is to decipher Grampas prune-fueled religious vision. Barts quest is to choose between Ned Flanders vision of the Holy Father and the more imperfect Homer Father. Baby Maggies quest is as usual mere survival. Beyond that its about 1000 more jokes and Homer riding a motorcycle inside a Cage of Death. So well leave you with just one more crack from a father-son fishing trip. Bart to Homer who is about to electro- shock all of Lake Springfield ""Dad I dont think its fair to fish with a bug zapper."" Homer ""If you love fish like I do you want them to die with dignity.""

Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies The Simpsons Entertainment News For an animated television show surviving 18 seasons and 400 episodes may not be as great an achievement as successfully filling up and living up to the big screen. I say that not because ""The Simpsons"" isnt a wonderful show but because it is Week after week its creator Matt Groening and the people who have guided the show over the years (including James L. Brooks and Brad Bird as well as its numerous writers and animators) have given us seemingly tossed-off vignettes of offhand genius. The wonder of the show is that nothing ever feels overworked Clever sight gags sail by on skateboard wheels giving us just the right amount of time down to the split second to take them in. (When Homer Simpson playing hooky from church on a Sunday makes a fat gooey waffle he doesnt just butter it -- he wraps it around a stick of butter a death falafel.) Even the shows overarching semiserious themes -- a favorite is the idea that anyone even the hapless seemingly hopeless boob Homer can learn to become a better person -- are always punctuated by a burp or a butt crack. If theres a god for individual TV shows the deity of ""The Simpsons"" isnt the one depicted on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel but the novelty-store T-shirt version of the same the one who urges Adam his greatest creation ""Pull my finger."" The Sistine Chapel ceiling isnt a bad metaphor for ""The Simpsons Movie"" if only for the way Groening and Brooks (two of the 11 screenwriters who worked on the picture) and director David Silverman (""Monsters Inc."") find so many smart ways to use the movie screens larger canvas. The story -- and I promise to give you only the barest rundown -- is an environmental epic laid out in a series of elbow-noodle turns Lisa (Yeardley Smith) at 10 the conscientious elder daughter of the family launches a campaign to clean up the ultra-polluted lake in the town of Springfield where the Simpsons live. The presentation she gives to the town assembly is called ""An Irritating Truth."" Simultaneously Homer (Dan Castellaneta) in between the eating of doughnuts instigates an environmental disaster involving a silo marked with the nearly poetic legend ""Pig Crap."" Meanwhile id-kid Bart (Nancy Cartwright) skateboards nude through the town on a dare from his father. And Marge (Julie Kavner) she of the blue beehive and quavery vowels busies herself trying to talk sense into her husband (a practically futile task if ever there was one) tending to baby Maggie (who wanders SweePea-like into various blithe misadventures including an encounter with a backyard sinkhole) and doing her best to keep the house tidy. In one of the movies sweetest touches she pauses during a life-and-death moment to grab wash and wipe a single plate sitting in the sink as perfect a summation of her dedication to her role as you could wish for. You Might Also Like The bigger idea wrapped around the higgledy-piggledy plot details of ""The Simpsons Movie"" -- the waffle around the butter if you will -- involves not just the necessity of taking care of our planet but the importance of flexibility and forgiveness in family life. The latter especially is a favorite ""Simpsons"" theme but what keeps it from ever being cloying in the show and in the movie is the way Groening and his writers so persistently revel in bad parenting -- a bold gleeful exaggeration of the style of parenting many of us grew up with in the 50s and 60s and into the 70s when parents raised kids even as they were also busy smoking and drinking in the backyard instead of organizing every minute around the childrens activities and imagined needs. Despite the fact that Homer allows -- no encourages -- Bart to hang from the edge of their houses roof you can never quite call him a bad parent He always comes through in the clutch more or less making him a vital and concrete metaphor for the imperfection of human beings and of parents -- either the parents we are or the parents we had or both. That and he eats all the things we wish we could eat (and some we dont) without guilt or reservation. Cartoons that work beautifully on TV often get swallowed up by the big screen as anyone who sat through the static and dopey ""Beavis and Butt-head Do America"" will recall. But with ""The Simpsons"" the filmmakers find inventive ways to use the extra acreage available to them expanding on the shows various mythologies without sacrificing its loose-limbed easygoing intimacy. One of the recurring gags of the show is that no one knows exactly where Springfield is. When the Simpsons deeply religious and even more deeply annoying neighbor Ned Flanders (Harry Shearer) takes Bart on a hiking trip he waves at the vista spread before them like a map of the territories of L. Frank Baums Oz and tells Bart that from this single spot they can see the four states bordering Springfield Ohio Nevada Maine and Kentucky. But the movies most brilliant moment is a gag involving a (cartoon) penis and a very long hedge. Even if you could get away with the subject matter on TV (which you couldnt) it would be a stretch to make the gag work visually. Here its an example of the filmmakers exalting in the wide-open territory of the big screen instead of fearing it. I went into ""The Simpsons Movie"" in a lousy mood and came out on the other side of the conveyor belt reconditioned and rejuvenated. The picture works because despite the fact that it took nearly six years for the filmmakers to bring it to the screen it doesnt strive for greatness. Its fleet concise and clever in a nut-ball way. On the seventh day God looked at all he created and saw that it was good. Then he let one rip. Stephanie Zacharek is a senior writer for Salon Arts amp; Entertainment. More Stephanie Zacharek.

"Simpsons Movie The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; simpsons-movie-the ) Simpsons Movie The (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli When it comes to The Simpsons longevity is an asset few can ignore. 18 years old and counting the TV series has carved its niche into pop culture. Most of todays high school students hadnt been born when The Simpsons debuted as filler on Tracey Ullmans variety show. Its no longer as fresh as acerbic and as popular as it once was but could one expect anything else from a show that has turned out about 400 twenty-two minute episodes? It is a little odd that it has taken so long for The Simpsons to make the transition from the small screen to the big one; there has been talk about a movie since the mid-90s. While nothing in this motion picture quite matches the television series at its early best this is more of a throwback than a throw-away. Its wittier and more energetic than anything that has appeared on FOX in quite a few years. The films irreverence is at full throttle from the opening moments when Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) wonders aloud why anyone would be stupid enough to pay money to see something in a theater they can see for free on TV. Later theres a none-too-subtle jab at FOXs aggressive style of self-promotion. The primary satirical targets are religion (an easy mark) environmentalists (also easy) and government stupidity (even easier). The Simpsons Movie does not go after hot button issues nor does it tie itself to a time and place by addressing current events. One senses that the filmmakers want their production to feel as fresh and timely in 2015 as in 2007. For the most part The Simpsons Movie is a series of rolling jokes. Its a little like Airplane in a sense - if something flops the wait for the next gag isnt long. The film is heavy on comedy and parody and light on emotion although there is a nice little arc in which Homer has an epiphany about the importance of family. Thats about as serious as The Simpsons has ever gotten and its certainly not going to bring tears to the eyes of many movie goers. People will flock to this picture because they want to enjoy the humor and it delivers. I laughed aloud a number of times and smiled and chuckled even more frequently. There is a plot although its not going to be mistaken for Shakespeare. It is however surprisingly coherent when one considers that there are nearly a dozen credited screenwriters. When the government discovers that the levels of toxicity in Springfields lake have reached critical levels (courtesy of a silo of ""pig crap"" dumped there by Homer) they quarantine the entire community. Homer and his family - wife Marge (Julie Kavner) son Bart (Nancy Cartwright) and daughters Lisa (Yeardley Smith) and Maggie - escape from Springfield and head to Alaska where they decide to start anew. But when word reaches them that the government intends to do more than merely isolate their hometown they take action. Long-time fans of The Simpsons will be pleased to note that many of the series recurring secondary characters have bit parts. They are well enough integrated that their inclusion wont bother Simpsons newbies. (Are there such people?) Harry Shearer and Hank Azaria do their usual yeomans work as back-up vocalists. Star power comes from President Arnold Schwarzenegger (voice provided by Shearer) and Tom Hanks (voice provided by Tom Hanks). Hanks participation is nothing new; over the years the series has become a magnet for big-name cameos. You know youve arrived once youve appeared on The Simpsons. Visually not a lot has been done to ""improve"" the characters for the big screen. There are times when the animation is a little crisper and there is occasional evidence of CGI (such as during the Frankenstein-inspired scene with an angry mob) but no major tweaking has been accomplished. Fans of the series will feel at home; the theme song even makes an appearance or two. The producers of the TV program are the driving forces behind the motion picture and they have ascertained that nothing is done to disappoint the core audience. If half the people who have ever enjoyed an episode of The Simpsons come to see the movie this will be a huge hit. Fox is counting on big numbers; their marketing department is in overdrive. The films PG-13 rating is a little misleading. With the exception of a little coarse language and a peep at Barts underdeveloped cartoon genitals (shown as part of a hilariously over-the-top naked skateboarding sequence) theres nothing in the movie that couldnt be shown on TV. This isnt like South Park which freed from the constraints of a more restrictive medium pulled out all the stops. The Simpsons is interested in being a family film although this is one of those rare animated occasions when adults are the primary audience. I for one couldnt be happier.

"Wheres the fire? - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEW Wheres the fire?Theres lots of fun but little risk as The Simpsons Movie hunts for deeper meaning.July 27 2007|Carina Chocano | Times Staff Writer ""THE SIMPSONS MOVIE"" begins aptly with a few scenes from the Itchy and Scratchy movie a bombastic summer blockbuster based on the ultra-violent cartoon that Bart and Lisa love. At the climax of the movie within the movie just as Itchy is pumping Scratchy full of nuclear missiles Homer stands up in the theater and wails ""I cant believe were paying for something we could get for free on TV. If you ask me everyone in this theater is a big sucker especially you.""The issue of getting your moneys worth seems to have been high on the minds of the shows writers and with some reason. After 18 years on the air the creators of the most trenchant deceptively easy-to-swallow satire in the history of TV wanted to find a topic capacious enough to warrant bumping up the aspect ratio to widescreen. What theyve come up with is an end-of-the-world scenario brought on by the towns own carelessness. As Itchy and Scratchy bring the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation the town of Springfield is nudged to the edge of environmental disaster by its own dumb hand.In some ways ""The Simpsons Movie"" feels a little like the Simpsons movie Lisa might have written. But its a strange path for the series star writers to have chosen -- this idea that more existential meant better. Of course the jokes are pin-sharp and off-the-wall loopy as ever and many sequences -- such as the one when Homer brings home his beloved new pet pig and the one in which Flanders makes Bart a cocoa with about 15 special touches -- are inspired. But once the movie wanders into its contemplation of mortality and meaning the trenchancy kind of creaks and falls off.The movie opens with Green Day performing a benefit concert for Lake Springfield the most polluted lake in the country. After concluding its set the band ventures a few words on the dangers of living near a toxic lake which naturally nobody wants to hear. Eventually the message comes directly from God -- via Grampa speaking in tongues -- a warning to the people of Springfield about a coming disaster involving ""a twisted tail a thousand eyes"" and something called ""eepah.""If youve seen the Korean toxic monster movie ""The Host"" you can more or less guess what happens next. Soon Springfield comes to find itself sealed off from the world inside a giant glass dome. When the townspeople find out who was responsible for the straw that broke the camels back (lets just say Homer is involved) they come after the Simpsons with a vengeance. Like any good apocalypse story ""The Simpsons Movie"" is full of strange reversals and portentous signs. You really know its the end of the world as we know it when Bart begins to wonder if he wouldnt be better off as Flanders son and when Marges unfailing loyalty starts to fail. But the most unexpected thing about ""The Simpsons Movie"" is that although it expands its view to include panoramic Alaskan vistas and a more panoptic view of Springfield than weve seen it doesnt push the boundaries of the TV show in a narrative sense.Unlike ""South Park Bigger Longer Uncut"" ""The Simpsons Movie"" doesnt venture anything more transgressive than it usually does; it doesnt take the gloves off. Sure there are jokes equating the U.S. government with the only evil madmen capable of encasing a town in a giant cheese dome but its nothing it hasnt done before and nothing we dont hear every night on ""The Daily Show With Jon Stewart.""If anything the movie feels a little safer (though I should say I stopped watching regularly years ago) than the show focusing on the individual crisis and subsequent spiritual growth of each individual Simpson (with the exception of Lisa who apparently didnt need it).In some ways it reminded me of the final ""Seinfeld"" episode. As much as I laughed throughout I kept wondering what was with all the emotional lessons. Strangest of all was Homers retreat to the cave (or igloo in this case) where he experiences an epiphany and sees himself clearly for the very first time. In fact ""The Simpsons Movie"" is basically a conversion narrative in which Homers eyes are finally opened to the error of his ways. The turnaround feels like the end of something -- like say the series. Because where do you go from an (albeit briefly) enlightened Homer and sensitive Bart? The only place I can think of is off into the sunset.carina.chocanolatimes.comMPAA rating PG-13 irreverent humor throughout. Running time 1 hour 26 minutes. In wide release.

A partial list includes Shelley Long and Ted Danson and the Davids DuchovnySchwimmer and Caruso. ENLARGE But there is no such cathode curse on Homer Marge Bart and Lisa Simpson. After 18 seasons and some 400 episodes of their Fox TV series the family created by Matt Groening the family that put the dys in dysfunctional makes a seamless transition from the shag carpet to the red carpet in the long-awaited ""Simpsons Movie."" For reasons best known to himself Homer (voiced by Dan Castellaneta) decides to acquire a pet pig and for reasons best known to himself he stores the creatures effluvium -- along with his own -- in a porous silo in the backyard. Nagged by his wife Marge (Julie Kavner) to do something about the leaky receptacle at exactly the time hes heard about a limited-time offer of free doughnuts Homer makes a characteristically selfish decision. His actions when brought to the attention of President Arnold Schwarzenegger all but destroy the town of Springfield to say nothing of Homers marriage and the budding romance of his do-gooding daughter Lisa (Yeardley Smith) -- who has just delivered a solemn address on the environment ""An Irritating Truth."" The movie pokes sly fun at the Simpsons own Fox network at television shows with the temerity to become feature-length presentations and at the sturdy conventions of disaster films. There are sharp references to such pop-culture touchstones as Spider-Man Bono Botox Home Depot and of course Harry Potter though a jab at the Kennedy familys impressive choppers seems at this point pretty old hat. ""The Simpsons Movie"" sputters just a bit toward the end when the paterfamilias is briefly out of the picture. When he returns eager as he generally is at the very very last possible minute to do the right thing alls well with the world. Hurray for Homer. Long may he rave. No Reservations ENLARGE Aaron Eckhart and Catherine Zeta-Jones in the romantic drama ""No Reservations."" Its plain old lousy timing this chronicle of a dedicated exacting chef being released in the wake of the kitchen-centered ""Ratatouille"" and ""Waitress."" Alongside those two charmers which beautifully demonstrate the transformative powers of food and love ""No Reservations"" is strictly cordon blah. Closely adapted from the appealing German movie ""Mostly Martha"" and proving yet again that possession of a winning recipe is no guarantee of success the comedy-drama ""No Reservations"" centers on Kate (Catherine Zeta-Jones) the laser-focused chef at a popular Greenwich Village restaurant. (In fact as played by Ms. Zeta-Jones Kate seems rather more cross than single-minded). Shes up every day at 430 a.m. to score the best catch at the fish market has little use for chitchat hasnt had a relationship in years and doesnt seem to feel the lack. Perhaps its sleep deprivation perhaps a failure to understand shes in a service business but Kate gets downright testy on those very rare occasions that a restaurant patron questions her preparation of a dish. (Its one of the movies missteps that the complaining customer is portrayed as so oafish that all sympathy goes to the chef.) In any case at the insistence of the restaurants owner (the always wonderful Patricia Clarkson) Kate is seeing a therapist (Bob Balaban) to improve her people skills. She spends many sessions reciting the ingredients of her signature dishes -- shes got heavy ego involvement in the quail with saffron sauce; the good doctor meanwhile spends many sessions eating the lunch Kate has prepared for him. He may well think its defensive; he also thinks its delicious. But now Kate has more to serve up to her therapist than the daily special. Shes unexpectedly become the (clueless) guardian of her 9-year-old niece Zoe (Abigail Breslin) -- by gosh who knew kids didnt like foie gras? -- at just about the same time an irrepressible opera-loving sous chef (Aaron Eckhart) joined the restaurant staff. Could he be after Kates job? Could he be after Kate? ""No Reservations"" has all the shock value of tuna surprise. The ravishing Ms. Zeta-Jones looks as though she hasnt had a square meal in years but thats perfectly OK. The cliche of the super-sized chef should certainly be put to rest if it hasnt already been. But this is a movie about a woman whose life is cooking (not that the filmmakers trouble themselves much to explain her passion) so shouldnt we see Kate do more than decorate a dessert plate or garnish an entree? ""No Reservations"" brushes aside such matters as briskly as it introduces and resolves conflicts. Unfortunately there isnt much chemistry between the engaging Mr. Eckhart and Ms. Zeta-Jones. All the more reason it would have been nice to have some heat in the kitchen. Arctic Tale The term ""global warming"" remains unspoken until the closing credits of this documentary which limns the life and changing times of a polar-bear cub and a walrus pup at the top of the Earth. Still it reverberates through almost every splendidly shot frame and is implicit in the cloying narration co-written by Kristin Gore daughter of Al (and voiced by Queen Latifah). Fifteen years in the making ""Arctic Tale"" charts the fortunes of the infant Nanu (the polar cub) and Seela (the walrus pup) as their respective mothers give them lessons for survival. But the animals longstanding skills are challenged by circumstances they dont begin to understand a foreshortened winter; thinning sheets of ice that will no longer support their weight; the disappearance or shrinking of the ice floes that have in the past served as diving platforms and safe havens. Seela and her kin have to swim longer and longer distances to find a secure place to perch; Nanu has to swim longer and longer distances to find her dinner -- if she can find it at all. Awe is the only proper response to extreme close-ups of a polar bear birth and to the shadow of an animal crossing the ice captured by an underwater camera. A mother polar bear and daughter lying at the side of an ailing family member is an unforgettable and heart-searing image. But the impact of ""Arctic Tale"" is blunted by its length (it feels long at 85 minutes) and by its script. Coming up with the right tone when youre aiming for a family audience is a tricky business. Too twee and you lose the adults. Too abstract and you lose the kids. ""The March of the Penguins"" nailed it. ""Arctic Tale"" like ""Penguins"" a production of National Geographic Films makes the mistake of anthropomorphizing its subjects and substitutes pallid whimsy for reportage. ""Theres something fishy about those birds"" notes Queen Latifah in describing thick-billed murres which both swim and fly. ""Seelas tusks are filling out nicely"" she notes of the maturing walrus. ""And some of the boys are starting to take notice."" Joe Morgenstern is on vacation.

Homer may be a movie star now but hes as oblivious as ever. By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor July 27 2007 Save for later Saved After 18 years and 400 episodes ""The Simpsons"" TV series finally makes it to the big screen. The good news is that for the most part the shows goofball edginess is transferred intact. Homer may be a movie star now but hes as oblivious as ever.No doubt this is the first movie ever made - animated or otherwise - that centers on a leaky silo of pig poo. It seems that Homers pet porker - whom he first names Spider Pig before switching to Harry Plopper - has been rather productive. When Homer dumps the droppings into Springfields biggest lake he creates an econightmare that incurs the wrath of the Environmental Protection Agency which encloses the community in a shatterproof dome. The Simpsons are forced into exile - to Alaska no less where ""you can never be too fat or too drunk.""Many of the ""Simpsons"" creative team past and present had a hand in the movie which explains its tonal affinity to the TV series. (The director was David Silverman and creator Matt Groening is one of the producers). There are reportedly 98 speaking parts which means that just about every character who has ever had a stint on TV gets a spot in the movie. And yet it never feels overextended. The filmmakers have made the wise decision to treat ""The Simpsons Movie"" as simply a bigger version of the TV show. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? There is perhaps a greater focus here on the current political scene but the jibes are mild. The EPA honcho (voiced by Albert Brooks) is a generic government bad guy and in a rather tired take-off the president of the United States is Arnold Schwarzenegger (voiced by Harry Shearer). Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Lisa Simpson the familys do-gooder daughter creates her version of ""An Inconvenient Truth"" - its called ""An Irritable Truth"" - but again the barbs are blunted.The movie is best when it just riffs on our compacted memories of the past 18 years of episodes. Fortunately thats most of the time. Grade A- ""The Simpsons Movie"" is rated PG-13 for irreverent humor.

Comments The Simpsons Movie Recommended Matt Groenings cartoon series The Simpsons has never made me laugh quite as hard as his Life in Hell anthologies which seem to spring from a deep well of personal bitterness that the shows writers cant fake. But of course thats a relative judgment--the show has been the gold standard for satirical TV ever since it debuted in 1989. This long-awaited movie adaptation has plenty of laughs plus an assortment of milestones for fans (Bart shows his privates Martin gets to thrash his enemies). The writers also take advantage of the PG-13 rating to violate a few small-screen taboos as Otto the bus driver is caught sucking on a bong and Homer tells his pet pig ""Maybe we should kiss just to break the tension."" 87 min.

So are those yellow skin tones the goofy overbites the ping-pong eyeballs with the black-dot pupils. And its not just the way they look. Its the way they talk walk work eat drink Duff Beer (Homer mostly) and belch (Homer and Bart mostly). Everything about the Simpsons - the cartoon sitcom clan that have made Rupert Murdoch enough billions to buy the Wall Street Journal - is iconic. Since the show debuted (with a Christmas episode) on Fox TV in December 1989 the characters created by cartoonist Matt Groening have seeped into the collective consciousness like toxic sewage into Lake Springfield. Which is where the long-awaited The Simpsons Movie begins actually with deadly waste courtesy of Homer and his new pet pig fouling Springfields water supply. It had to happen and it has after 400 episodes and more dudes and dohs than is possible to count the ingenious subversive hilarious touching politically savvy politically incorrect laser-sharp satiric TV megahit made it to the big screen. Years in the making with 11 credited screenwriters (plus four ""consultants"") and numerous false starts The Simpsons Movie is finally here. And guess what? Its funny. But not that funny. Everybody has a list of their top Simpsons episodes (a couple of mine ""Rosebud"" the Citizen Kane parody and ""The Crepes of Wrath"" in which exchange-student Bart toils in misery on a French farm) but Ill bet that few will find The Simpsons Movie on a par with their particular faves. While every effort (and then some) has been made to supersize The Simpsons for the multiplex with a wide-screen format accommodating the work of four animation studios on two continents; with guest appearances by the likes of Green Day and Tom Hanks; with a save-the-world eco-disaster plotline and a Homerian odyssey that takes Americas preeminent couch potato to the wilds of Alaska where a large-breasted Inuit shaman offers spiritual counsel the film feels more like a patchwork of episodes than a fluid organic whole. (There are happily doughnut holes.) Yes the Simpsons family bonds are put to the test and yes series regulars Itchy and Scratchy Principal Skinner and insufferably nice nice-guy neighbor Ned Flanders put in appearances. Lisa gets swoony when an Irish kid named Colin takes a liking to her and the Constitution of the United States has apparently been amended to allow foreign-born nationals to live in the White House The countrys president is Arnold Schwarzenegger. But The Simpsons Movie with its endless end credits (sit through them though - its worth it) is ultimately a bit of a letdown. Why? Because its not the television show and that is truly where Homer and Marge Bart and Lisa and pacifier-sucking little Maggie belong. The Simpsons Movie  (out of four stars) Directed by David Silverman. With the voices of Dan Castellaneta Julie Kavner Nancy Cartwright Yeardley Smith Hank Azaria and Harry Shearer.

Share Tweet The deafening buzz greeting The Simpsons Movie represents a marriage of convenience between savvy corporate marketing and frothing fanboy adulation. Fox has stoked anticipation for the film to feverish levels simply by tapping into the massive groundswell of goodwill the show has built up over two decades as one of the countrys most beloved pop-culture phenomena. Such torrents of hype often lead to crushing disappointment but The Simpsons Movie more or less justifies its massive buildup. It isnt the best movie ever nor will it make fans forget the shows early-90s golden years but audiences will probably be too busy laughing to complain about any shortcomings. In a plot that combines John Swartzwelder zaniness with James L. Brooks sentiment The Simpsons Movie pushes the destructive tendencies of hapless patriarch Homer Simpson to their logical extreme. When Homers thoughtlessness causes an ecological disaster of extinction-level proportions EPA head Russ Cargill (voiced by Simpsons favorite Albert Brooks) sequesters the entire city of Springfield under a giant dome. On the home front Marge once again begins to wonder whether Homers brusque facade hides a core of innate decency or simply more boorishness. Its up to Homer to save Springfield and his marriage in roughly that order. The fingerprints of co-writer/producer James L. Brooks are all over the genuinely tender moments sprinkled amongst the silliness such as a surprisingly poignant subplot that finds Bart embracing Jesus-loving neighbor Ned Flanders as a warm supportive stable surrogate father figure. Where The Simpsons social satire once had fangs it now sports something closer to baby teeth. Though the writers take potshots at their parent corporation as well as one of its primary corporate competitors (heres a hint it rhymes with Misney) theres no danger of Fox being nibbled to death by its prize piranha. But like a legendary band trotting out old hits The Simpsons Movie benefits from a soothing sense of familiarity The gags themes and ideas are familiar and well-worn but theres joy in them all the same. Though it never regains the inspiration or comic density of its brilliant first 20 minutes The Simpsons Movie keeps the laughs coming from start to finish a feat as rare and wonderful in film as it has been through 18 years of television.

Movie review ""The Simpsons Movie"" with the voices of Dan Castellaneta Julie Kavner Nancy Cartwright Yeardley Smith Harry Shearer and Hank Azaria. Directed by David Silverman.87 minutes. Rated PG for irreverent humor. The long-awaited ""Simpsons"" feature film does not eat my shorts. Doesnt set em on fire either. Early in the film Homer (Dan Castellaneta) shouts about something hes watching in a theater ""I cant believe were paying for something we get on TV for free"" Addressing and attempting to pre-empt the big nagging question shows character. But it doesnt dissipate it Should you drive pay to park shell out dough (Doh) for a ticket and buy the overpriced food (even if you dont eat like Homer) for an 87-minute big-screen version of a show thats been running approximately 47 years on Fox? At the risk of sounding like Principal Skinner When they make movies from TV shows -- and not the generally evil big-screen remakes of old ones like ""I Spy"" -- its for greed. But also to work with a budget and scope bigger and more satisfying than weekly TV allows (see the ""X-Files"" movie) and to cut loose with material theyd never get away with on the small screen (see the ""South Park"" movie and its Uncle song). Or in the case of the upcoming ""Sex and the City"" film ... ah ... to see the middle-age stars getting hot flashes? Thats a tougher one. If you pay to see the ""Simpsons"" flick -- and dont illegally download it the fleeting subject of Barts chalkboard punishment -- youll get plenty of laughs whether or not youre already a fan and plenty of in-jokes if you are. But its not a cathartic grandiose experience with no hot flashes. People dont want to see those characters have dirty sex or swear like theyre on ""Deadwood"" anyway. Creator Matt Groening and his 11 listed screenwriters push the irreverence slightly further than on the tube with Barts riotous naked skateboarding scene and getting the boy drunk. Marge says one borderline off-color word. All too mild to cause a cow-birth. It begins with the familiar Homer as human Id losing his temper and choking Bart getting into a dare contest that culminates in the skateboarding and assorted other things Ward Cleaver never would have done to The Beav. Bart feels like a whipped dog then just neglected as his dad makes a pig best friend -- singing ""Spider-Pig Spider-Pig"" to it as he walks it along the living-room ceiling. Lisas growing environmental activism -- bolstered by meeting a dreamy boy into same -- dovetails with Homers swine-crush resulting in a disaster that prompts an illiterate president and his ruthless government official to drastic measures that threaten to destroy Springfield. And it all threatens to tear the Simpson family apart. The movies short and focused so the myriad other Springfield characters get shortchanged. Everyone has favorites. Given the shows adroitness with social satire and the rise of corporatism I would have enjoyed more with the diabolical Mr. Burns; and I just think Barney the drunk and Moe the bartender are funny. Suited to the larger venue theres a larger perfunctory point about Homer learning some lesson about the importance of family. But it cant trump a moment with young thug Nelson whose trademark ""Ha-haaa"" mockery provides one of the few cathartic moments in the funniest possible spot.

""How come every time I think of something clever"" Butters asks ""The Simpsons already did it?"" The episode was a tribute from one cadre of cartoon geniuses--South Parks Trey Parker and Matt Stone--to another earlier one Matt Groening James L. Brooks and their team of highly educated misfits who developed Groenings crudely drawn one-minute Tracey Ullman Show vignettes of a chinless yellow family into a half-hour sitcom nay a veritable comedy cosmos that this fall begins its record-breaking 19th season on Fox. Once they had produced 400 shows and run a zillion variations on Homers Brobdingnagian stupidity Marges slow burn Barts overachieving impishness Lisas displaced intelligence and Maggies muteness The Simpsons caretakers faced another challenge. How could they expand 22 min. of content into a coherent cholerically funny 87-min. worth-paying-for laff riot shown on a wall in a mall? And beyond how--why? Maybe because Parker and Stone had proved it could be done splendidly with their 1999 South Park Bigger Longer amp; Uncut. Anyway heres The Simpsons Movie. It was worth waiting for. In an ecologically threatened Springfield Homer fouls the local lake with the refuse of a pig hes fallen in love with. The place is declared a disaster area and an evil government bureaucrat orders that the town be domed. Having alienated everyone with his idiocy Homer must prove himself a hero ""Risking my life--to save people I hate--for reasons I dont really understand."" The film written by 11 guys and directed by David Silverman in the old-fashioned hand-drawn way looks surprisingly spiffy on the big screen. Its rated PG-13 (for brief frontal nudity) but vulgarity was never the envelope The Simpsons pushed. Its goal was density comic congestion the vacuum-packing of cool gags and grotesque-sympathetic characters into the shortest span possible. The little miracle of the movie is that this plays out at four times the length without giving you a headache. The film finds its own pace and it keeps its personality. It doesnt try to be ruder or kinkier just bigger and better. It follows a rule Brooks laid down at the beginning of the series Dont be afraid to show emotion. Audience that goes for you too when you watch Homer and Marges worst ever marital crisis. Sob away unabashedly. So for those of you who were wondering if a great TV show could top itself at feature-film length the good news is that The Simpsons did it But South Park did it first.

The ... more Mmm ... popcorn movie 1 / 2 Back to Gallery The Simpsons Movie Animated comedy. Voiced by Dan Castellaneta Julie Kavner Nancy Cartwright Hank Azaria and Yeardley Smith. Directed by David Silverman. (PG-13. 86 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete listings and show times and to buy tickets to select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies .) It takes real cojones as Homer Simpson might say and does in ""The Simpsons Movie"" to make the leap to the big screen after 18 seasons as the worlds most successful prime-time animated TV show. Heres the shorthand verdict No one will be bored with the feature film opening with midnight screenings today at Bay Area theaters but everyone who knows the show well will have a nagging feeling that something is missing. Given our familiarity with the Fox series we might expect the hilarity of the film to be something akin to three half-hour episodes strung together. But director David Silverman and writers Matt Groening James L. Brooks Al Jean and others obviously faced the big challenge of having to find a through story line. How about Homer screws things up as only he can Springfield is targeted for complete destruction but then Homer saves the day? I think well find that one on the fifth shelf from the top in the 20th Century Fox archives. Dust it off and weve got ourselves a feature film. No one cares that the basic story line is hackneyed and convenient when the laugh lines visual puns and in-jokes work and fortunately they do work often enough to make the film pretty funny. After a kind of faux start where Homer says what some of us may be thinking (""I cant believe were paying to see something we get for free on TV"") the real opening is brilliant It features Green Day vocalizing ""The Simpsons"" theme music (""da-da-da-dada-da-da-da-daaa-daaaa"") and then dying in an environmental disaster. Cut to the funeral service where the hymn is ""American Idiot Funeral Version."" The real plot is set in motion when Grandpa Simpson has a holy epiphany or perhaps some kind of fit in church and predicts a dire future for Springfield. Marge alone takes it seriously while Lisa attempts to enlighten the town about the pitiful state of Lake Springfield by hosting a talk labeled ""An Irritating Truth."" The story line is pushed along by some wonderfully goofy touches including Homers rescue of a pig which in turn leads to an environmental crisis that prompts President Schwarzenegger to empower the EPA to seal the entire town under a massive dome. But of course its the touches that get our attention Homer walking the pig on the ceiling and singing the ""Spider-Man"" theme the sinking of Green Days performance stage as if it were James Camerons ""Titanic"" the arrival of flocks of little Disney bluebirds to help Marge and Homer prepare for a marital tryst the interrupting crawl at the bottom of the screen to promote a phony Fox network show. The film sags whenever it relies only on the plot to keep our attention. Silverman does an adequate job of moving things along but again fans of the show may find the look of ""The Simpsons Movie"" to be just a tad too three-dimensional. One of the charms of the show is the relative simplicity of the animation and the flat look of the characters contrasted with the sophistication of the humor. By contrast the animation style of the film is more sophisticated the characters appear almost three-dimensional and such details as tree shadows on the sides of buildings have been added. Its all very pretty but it robs the film of one of the elements that makes the series so brilliant visual irony. Of course the voice cast is brilliant and perfect. Although the credits list every character that Julie Kavner Dan Castellaneta Nancy Cartwright Yeardley Smith and Hank Azaria et al have voiced through the history of the series the characters themselves arent all present. You might miss a few of them but the filmmakers were wise in not trying to crowd the movie more than necessary. Guest voices include the three guys from Green Day and Tom Hanks. The guest stars depicted in Simpson animation of course are always highlights of the TV show (Stephen Hawking? Thomas Pynchon? Ay caramba). We might wish for a few more but they would have probably junked up the film too much. Is it fun? Sure. Its the Simpsons. How could it not be? And yet ... and yet. And yet you cant help thinking it is ""The Simpsons"" the most creative animated show of all time the show that remains fresh and edgy and creative week after week the show that like Bart is never afraid to skateboard along the edge. Only this time it seems to be wearing a helmet.

"Almost a Homer - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Almost a HomerNo need to release the houndsThe Simpsons Movie lives up to series standardsJuly 27 2007|By Michael Phillips Tribune movie criticTHE SIMPSONS MOVIEFor once the rich white man is in control"" Mr. Burns incomparable plutocratic sniveler voiced by the real star of ""The Simpsons Movie"" Harry Shearer hasnt much screen time in this adaptation -- a good one; a little disappointing but good -- of the animated television series created by Matt Groening. But Shearer does get to snivel that line one of many lines by 11 credited writers that does its job deftly and then skitters out of the way for the next one.At its best the 87-minute film directed by series long-timer David Silverman works in a loose inspired way as opposed to a reliable well-carpentered way recalling the prime early years of the series when the blizzard of in-jokes and the hailstorm of out-jokes the ultraviolent slapstick and the precious deadpan verbal mutterings conspired to make ""The Simpsons"" something formidable and a little terrifying.No modern series has had a more profound influence on the quality of TV comedy. No great television comedy stoked a nations merry des-pair with better zingers and quicker-witted corner-of-the-eye detail. The downside is that when a strictly mercantile entertainment transaction such as ""Shrek the Third"" comes along nearly a generation after Springfields finest were introduced you can blame the higher (maybe the highest) grade of cynicism found in ""The Simpsons.""Homer Simpsons oafishness reaches apocalyptic levels in ""The Simpsons Movie."" The story on which Groening James L. Brooks and nine other credited writers labored is set into motion by Grampas religious visions and Homer adopting a pet pig and Lisa being a good little Al Gore and warning of the dangers of polluting the daylights out of the local water supply. Against his non-existent better judgment Homer ignores his daughters wisdom which leads to the Environmental Protection Agency ordering an emergency lockdown situation per President Arnold Schwarzeneggers approval. (Albert Brooks voices the venal EPA head.)I suppose the series creators felt a need to go for some bombast in a film version of ""The Simpsons"" though I found myself slumping a bit during the computer-generated sequences designed to exploit the bigger screen and ""deliver."" Im more into the jokes on the fly. ""Stop in the name of American squeamishness"" hollers a cop to a naked skateboarding Bart. A throwaway bit about a bomb-detonating robot cracking under pressure adds up to 10 bucks worth of comedy in 10 seconds of screen time. The hit-and-run jokes targeting the Disney corporation Fox News crawls and Mitch Albom satisfy one comic craving while the freshest element in the script -- Lisas crippling crush on an Irish boy who shares her politics and her love of the environment -- satisfies a very different and sweeter one. Likewise a snowbound romantic interlude for Homer and Marge (the familys fled to Alaska; no need to know why really) with Disneyesque forest critters aiding and abetting the hookup builds easily and fluidly and ends with just the right sight gag.The previews for ""The Simpsons Movie"" lean heavily on Homer falling through roofs and getting banged around by wrecking balls. The previews arent lying. This sort of lumpen slapstick grows wearying and there are times (as has been the case in certain lesser cycles of the TV series) when the film appears to have been directed by Itchy and Scratchy. In the end Silverman and Groening and Brooks figure out a way to appeal to a wide variety of ""Simpson"" fans rabid and casual alike. If that sounds slightly compromised well ... I only wish the creators couldve managed a miracle and come up with a feature on the order of the ""South Park"" movie ""Bigger Longer amp; Uncut"" which amazed fans and newbies alike with its satiric nerve (not to mention the songs). ""The Simpsons Movie"" is comparatively minor. But its hard not to like it. And in both senses of the phrase America keeps asking for it.REVIEWThe Simpsons MovieDirected by David Silverman; screenplay by James L.

(which given the unspecified coordinates of Springfield might not be that far at all) where President Schwarzenegger and an overzealous EPA chief (voiced by Albert Brooks) rush to contain a Homer-instigated eco-crisis by encasing all of Springfield in a giant impenetrable bio(hazard)-sphere thus reducing Americas favorite cartoon hamlet to the worlds largest snow globe. Blame it I suppose on the pig -- the adorable little oinker Homer saves from becoming tomorrows Krusty Burger with whom he develops such an inseparable bond that you may feel as though youre in for the Brokeback Mountain of animated bestiality movies and whose prodigious pig poop is what gets Homer and Springfield into this whole giant mess in the first place. And that is The Simpsons Movie in a nutshell -- a 90-minute years-in-the-making comic wind-up machine that begins by mocking its own audience for paying good money to see what it can watch at home for free and proceeds from there through the most wickedly funny arsenal of assaults on big government organized religion and corporate America this side of Borat (which like The Simpsons Movie somehow managed to use Rupert Murdochs money to do so). This of course has long been the beauty of creator Matt Groenings two-decade-old television behemoth and bona fide cultural institution where a firm grip of dysfunctional family values and the facade of kid-friendly animation have provided a fertile breeding ground for the kind of social satire that sails right over the heads of some while striking others squarely where they live.In all fairness The Simpsons Movie doesnt exactly go where no episode of the TV series has gone before (unless you mean literally to Alaska in which case I stand corrected). Rather what The Simpsons Movie does -- and does extremely well -- is revisit the series most enduring situations and themes while upping the ante just enough to lend everything a new level of suspense. This time around Homers doughnut-addled dunderheadedness doesnt merely put his own family in jeopardy -- it nearly causes Springfield itself to be wiped off the map. Meanwhile even on the home front the consequences are more dire Duly humiliated after being bullied by Homer into a nude-skateboarding dare -- one of several priceless gags unforgivably revealed in the movies trailer -- Bart goes searching for a more stable father figure and nearly finds one in (egads) Ned Flanders. And in a subplot that turns out to carry unexpected emotional weight the ever-resilient Marge (voiced as usual by the redoubtable Julie Kavner) is forced to examine the very bedrock of her marriage to see if theres anything there worth salvaging. That leads to a third-act monologue -- for which longtime Simpsons writer-producer (and Terms of Endearment Oscar winner) James L. Brooks reportedly demanded more than 100 takes from Kavner -- that is one of the deepest and most searching examinations of the meaning of ""I do"" that Ive ever heard in a movie. It does the last thing you might expect The Simpsons Movie to do It leaves you with a lump in your throat.The Simpsons Movie has much else to recommend it not least of all a wonderfully surreal Dali-like encounter between Homer and an Inuit medicine woman in the wilds of Alaska (dont ask); and after 18 seasons of seeing Springfield squeezed into the tiny parameters of the television frame theres an undeniable kick to the movie versions vivid widescreen compositions. But the most meaningful achievement of The Simpsons Movie may be its reminder that we dont merely take pleasure in the weekly exploits of Homer Marge Bart Maggie Lisa Grandpa Patty Selma Milhouse Flanders Moe Apu Smithers Mr. Burns et al.; we look at them -- yellow skin blue hair bulging eyes and all -- and see reflected back the best and worst of ourselves and an uncannily accurate portrait of the modern American family.

Few television comedies have successfully made the transition to the big screen and with the exception of ""The Flintstones"" none has done it with the original cast intact. ""The Simpsons Movie"" attempts to do both things and while the result isnt hideous it also isnt great. Its funny but its not funny. The TV show from which this long-awaited adaptation is drawn is a series of exquisite miniatures an accumulation of small pleasures played out over 18 seasons. There is no single touchstone episode that fans of the show return to again and again quoting hallowed lines of dialogue from memory. The only thing epic about it is the size of Homers caboose. If ever a situation comedy were perfectly proportioned for television its ""The Simpsons."" But because everything is being done on a grander scale for ""The Simpsons Movie"" TV-sized laughs tend to rattle around and die in the Dolby-enhanced echo chamber of the multiplex. Its only fair to expect the humor to be more panoramic on the big screen too. But it isnt. In fact the sweep of the production seems to work against it most of the time. ""The Simpsons Movie"" often is just as funny as the TV show but at four times the normal length and outside its customary jewel box setting sharply observed moments are overwhelmed by the need to pump up the volume and keep things moving along.Advertisement So when Bart (voiced by Nancy Cartwright) jumps into a sinkhole yelling ""Geronimo"" and Lisa (Yeardley Smith) follows with a more culturally astute cry of ""Sacagawea"" the laugh vanishes down the hole with her. The writers who come breathtakingly close to outnumbering the animators in the closing credits have lost none of their gift for self-mockery. Following the ""Itchy amp; Scratchy"" cartoon that opens the movie Homer (Dan Castellaneta) quickly reminds us that theyre in on the joke. ""I cant believe were paying to see something we get on TV for free"" he bellows. ""If you ask me everybody in this theater is a big sucker."" Then pointing directly into the camera he adds ""Especially you"" Fortunately this joke arrives at the beginning when we can all still laugh at ourselves for doing exactly what he says were doing. By the end of the movie its a lot less funny. Direct references to the TV show are fairly frequent and while at least one is brilliant others fall flat. That happens a lot in this slightly over-inflated cartoon balloon. Small life-sized events such as Lisa falling for the cute new Irish boy (Maile Flanagan) in town might serve as the basis for an entire episode of the television series. But here they become part of her characters ""story arc"" and along with the arcs of Bart Homer and Marge (Julie Kavner) each forms a rib in the construction of the gigantic zeppelin that carries the plot. Word of advice When youre building a comedy thats supposed to be lighter than air its probably not a good idea to hang it from a story shaped like the Hindenburg. These plot contrivances involve Homer falling in love with a pig (a running joke that goes nowhere) the pig contaminating Springfields drinking water the Simpsons leaving town in disgrace then returning for Homers shot at redemption. The movie isnt a disaster just a disappointment. Fans of characters such as Montgomery Burns and Apu are likely to be dismayed by their fleeting appearances. And while its nice to know that if you did indeed eat Barts shorts you would find him to be all boy seeing him fall under the spell of Ned Flanders (Harry Shearer) was almost more than I could bear. I suspect that anyone unfamiliar with the TV show would be utterly baffled by this movie. It does look better than the TV show with a newfound dimensionality to action sequences such as Barts naked skateboard ride through downtown Springfield. But with their yellow skin Marges blue hair and Homers dirigible-sized gut the Simpsons are not the Incredibles. And looks arent supposed to count. `The Simpsons Movie 1/2 Mercury News Rated PG-13 (irreverent humor throughout) Voice castDan Castellaneta Julie Kavner Nancy Cartwright Yeardley Smith Hank Azaria Harry Shearer Albert Brooks Director David Silverman WritersJames L.

"The Simpsons Movie Not Exxxxxcellent washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Entertainment News >> Follow Entertainment News On The Simpsons Movie Not Exxxxxcellent Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By JAKE COYLE The Associated Press Wednesday July 25 2007; 751 PM -- The universe of ""The Simpsons"" _ outlandish yellow and absent of normal human growth _ has sketched with parodying perfection the struggle of family life the exploitation of a neighbors good will and the bizarre qualities of school bus drivers to name just a few of its accomplishments. In one of its greatest episodes about Prohibition Homers concluding toast demonstrated how the animated series could be as damning as it was hilarious ""To alcohol the cause and solution to all of lifes problems"" ""The Simpsons Movie"" arrives a decade after that 1997 episode and long after its glory days. Not to sound too much like the Comic Book Guy but the Fox sitcom which once brilliantly satirized TVs conventions has gradually settled into its own ruts _ which usually entails Homer acting silly for silliness sake. After 18 seasons on television the much-anticipated big-screen debut of ""The Simpsons"" feels purposeless _ as if creator Matt Groening finally thought ""Well we might as well."" The movie quickly revels in lampooning itself. Ralph Wiggum crawls over the opening 20th Century Fox logo. An ""Itchy and Scratchy"" segment then plays out before revealing the Simpsons family watching seated in a movie theater. ""I cant believe were paying for something we get for free on TV"" exclaims Homer (voiced by Dan Castellaneta). An alteration of the shows opening sequence leads to a Green Day concert where the band tries to speak about pollution thereby setting up the action Lake Springfield it turns out is a polluted mess the result of _ among other things _ Krusty the Clown dumping tankfuls of his flop sweat into it. Homer ruins a cleanup effort however emptying a silo (yes a silo) of pig feces in the lake the result of his new best friend the adopted Spider-Pig whos later renamed Plopper. This isnt Homers first love affair with a potential meal nor his only go-around with a pig. Fans will recall his ""pig-de-la-resistance"" in ""Lisa the Vegetarian"" the excellent 1995 episode in which vegetarianism is tackled more successfully than pollution is here. Lake Springfield promptly turns black and the Environmental Protection Agency led by Russ Cargill (Albert Brooks) soon intervenes placing a giant transparent dome over Springfield and its townspeople. Its a clearly redundant entrapment for a town that exists everywhere and nowhere. (At one point standing atop a mountain Ned Flanders points to the states bordering Springfield Ohio Maine Kentucky and Nevada.) Cargill _ who sounds a lot like Hank Scorpio the maniacal but cheery evil genius Brooks voiced in a 1996 episode _ works for President Arnold Schwarzenegger (Harry Shearer) who declares ""I was elected to lead not to read."" Homer must save the town from Cargills plans for Springfield but more importantly he has to win back the trust of Marge Bart Lisa and Maggie. The plot is wayward at times _ particularly a trip to Alaska that feels excerpted from an unaired episode. But narrative was never what drove ""The Simpsons."" It was always the jokes which are just as relentless here as they are on the show. Under director David Silvermans stewardship the animation is brighter and filled with more background detail. Every character now maneuvers with a carefully drawn shadow. Little has changed in the leap to the big screen but we do gain a new perspective on Springfield where Mr. Burns house is now so elevated it seems more like the Grinchs lair hovering above Whoville. We also see for the first time Nelsons mother (she also says ""Ha ha"") Milhouses neighborhood and Barts bathing suit area. His full-frontal scene is one of the movies best visual gags. While ""The Simpsons Movie"" is _ like the TV show has become _ too much a caricature of itself it still possesses good cheer an aversion to self-seriousness and manic energy for stuffing the screen with layers of humor. In one of the final scenes Homer again finds himself soaring across Springfield Gorge as he did in the 1990 ""Bart the Daredevil"" episode. On the other side of the gorge moviegoers will notice an old ambulance from that episode crashed against a tree _ as though its been sitting there in SimpsonLand for 17 years. The small artifact of animation recalls both the shows bygone triumphs and stubborn resilience. ""The Simpsons Movie"" a 20th Century Fox release is rated PG-13 for irreverent humor throughout. Running time 87 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four. ___ Motion Picture Association of America rating definitions G _ General audiences. All ages admitted. PG _ Parental guidance suggested.

Brooks Matt Groening Al Jean Ian Maxtone-Graham George Meyer David Mirkin Mike Reiss Mike Scully Matt Selman John Swartzwelder Jon Vitti; Release Date Wide 07/27/2007 Posted July 25 2007 -- 1200 AM EDT Forty-two years in the making 250 speaking character roles an epic animated parable about sin redemption and mail-bearing owls that was first sketched out on the back of a takeout menu with a stubby pencil circulated among 18 writers who found themselves stranded en masse at Chicagos OHare airport one special Christmas Eve The Simpsons Movie cant claim any such spectacle or creation mythology. And thats great news especially for devotees of the profound and profoundly funny long-running TV show -- we who have been wondering (and maybe even worrying) for some time what revered writer-producers James L. Brooks Matt Groening Al Jean and Mike Scully would do with three times the usual space to tell a Simpsons story. Would there be radical character development or stunt celebrity participation? Charming image-enhancing voice-over work from presidential candidate Hillary Clinton? Would there be magic? Turns out what theyve done is make everything bigger longer and uncut but let Homer be Homer an average American screwup in a recognizable screwed-up world of hypocrisy and lardy foodstuffs. The best thing about this long-awaited feature-length project a classic Simpsonian interplay of family psychology social commentary and brainy visual and verbal jokes tossed off at rat-a-tat speed is how relaxed it manages to be (or appears to be -- the hard work is for the most part hidden) even as it expands emotionally to fill a bigger screen. Aware of its responsibilities to ticket buyers at all times -- from the raucously clever opening to the last rewarding frame of the closing credits -- this is a project that understands that the best TV-to-movie transitions emphasize depth not length. When Bart looks at neighbor Ned Flanders with new eyes and thinks about the qualities that make a good father that counts as big news. So yes theres plot. Theres the part where Homer adopts a pet pig and lovingly collects the porkers droppings in a backyard silo and then dumps the silo into Lake Springfield despite dire warnings about the towns looming environmental problems (Lisa Simpsons community lecture about local pollutants ""An Irritating Truth"" falls on unmotivated ears). Naturally Homer doesnt think twice about his crime because Homer never listens to anything except the chingy-chingy sound of the windup monkey clanging cymbals that is the soundtrack loop in his little brain. And yes the toxic calamity gets so bad that the Environmental Protection Agency decides to entomb all of Springfield in an impermeable bubble -- for starters. (Under the administration of a certain President Schwarzenegger the EPA has been co-opted by a rich ethically unencumbered plutocrat with the resonant name of Cargill voiced with gusto by Albert Brooks.) And well okay the Simpson clan manages at one point to escape to Alaska where theres a delightful moment involving a tap-dancing penguin (not so happy in the end for the penguin but a thrill for Simpsons fans who count on the series barbed pop cultural commentary) and a romantic interlude between husband and wife before family tensions come to a crisis. Also Homer briefly rides a motorcycle organizes a team of sled dogs and embarks on a hallucinogenic trip in no particular order. And theres a spectacular skateboard scene that rewards some two decades of loyalty as a naked Bart streaks past everybody who ever walked the streets of Springfield. But honestly the ""action"" sequences sometimes falter overstaying their welcome and turning into filler because plot has never been what distinguishes The Simpsons either on TV or in this movie. Its the dohs. The Proustian value of doughnuts. The reliability of Homers boorishness the Comic Book Guys obsessiveness Milhouses asthma attacks the pleasures of the genius cast of regulars voicing all those obstreperous residents. And the way one yellow family of four-fingered individualists -- Homer and Marge Bart Lisa and Maggie Grampa and even the addled dog Santas Little Helper -- are committed in the face of all obstacles to sticking together. With limited spiritual help (""This book doesnt have any answers"" Homer shrieks in church riffling through the Bible for advice when Grampa falls to the floor in an apparent religious fit) and even less faith in government (""I was elected to lead not to read"" declares President Schwarzenegger) the Simpson center does hold. And The Simpsons Movie sweetly cradles one great American family.

SMITHERS You remember Simpson that oxygen-waster in sector 7G? BURNS Never heard of him. SMITHERS He seems to have a movie out. BURNS Another D.W. Griffith spectacular eh? Starring Lillian Gish and Harold Lloyd I hope? SMITHERS No sir. But it does have Albert Brooks and a surprise guest - one of the biggest movie stars of the last 20 years. BURNS Piffle and nincompoopery Cant President Hoover do something about Hollywood standards? SCENE II - EVENING NEWS KENT BROCKMAN Springfields top story tonight Local boob Homer Simpson has caused an environmental crisis by dumping a silo full of his pet pigs waste into Lake Springfield A sinister EPA agent who sounds a lot like Albert Brooks has ordered an airtight dome placed over the entire city. Looks like goodbye Mother Nature hello Smother Nature Film crews are already making a movie on the subject. As doomsday approaches local residents are delivering impassioned viewpoints. SCENE III - MAN ON STREET INTERVIEW NELSON MUNTZ HAW-ha SCENE IV - SIMPSONS HOUSE HOMER Whoo-hoo Im gonna be in a movie MARGE Thats nice Homey. But at the moment theres an angry mob outside with torches. LISA Is my new environmentally aware Irish boyfriend out there? BART Lisas got a boyfriend Lisas got a boyfriend LISA Youre the one who shows his wiener in this movie. HOMER Mmm. Wiener. MARGE Something about this movie strikes me as awfully familiar. COMIC BOOK GUY I of course have already seen ""The Simpsons Movie"" and decreed on my blog that the star power of musical guest Green Day does not measure up to The Who or U2. The good news is ""The Simpsons Movie"" is just like the TV show whereas the bad news is its just like the TV show. Instead of trying something radically different it follows a conventional plotline of Homer screwing up and trying to fix the situation. Though it does have a handful of dirty jokes meant to earn the audience-pleasing PG-13 rating and features Marge swearing it falls short of classic status. PROFESSOR FRINK Empirical testing shows it to be less frantically paced than the TV show and two-thirds as funny as the ""Marge vs. the Monorail"" or ""Rosebud"" episodes. APU I found the Itchy and Scratchy section as pleasing as one of my strawburritos. GRAMPA SIMPSON I havent seen a movie this funny in 73 years Which was the last time I went to the movies. SCENE V - MRS. KRABAPPLES CLASSROOM MRS. KRABAPPLE Class can anyone explain the concept of ""meta""? MARTIN Endlessly self-referential in a humorous but potentially aggravating manner? KRABAPPLE Any examples? MARTIN In ""The Simpsons Movie"" when Homer says ""I cant believe were paying to see something we can get on TV for free."" JIMBO Mrs. Krabapple? Can I get extra credit by giving Martin a humorous series of wedgies? SCENE VI - POLICE STATION LOU Chief? We have a report that the Simpson family responsible for destroying the environment escaped and became fugitives in Alaska. Weve also heard that Marge and Homer have been engaging in uh lovemaking with help from some whimsical forest animals. CHIEF WIGGUM (Putting down his sandwich) Well there goes my appetite. LOU Also another disaster is headed for Springfield and it looks like Homer is the only one who can save us. CHIEF WIGGUM Sweet peppery Jesus I cant believe it LOU I know. CHIEF WIGGUM You knew? (Putting down Entertainment Weekly) Then why didnt you tell me ""Sheriff Lobo"" was available on DVD? THE SIMPSONS MOVIE Whoo-hoo Running time 88 minutes. Rated PG-13 (sex humor profanity drug references). Starts tomorrow at the Lincoln Square the Kips Bay the Union Square others.

After 18 years and 400 episodes ""The Simpsons"" has developed a wide array of potential moviegoers from those who still watch to those who once watched to those who dont watch anymore but now have kids that do. The question is how many will feel inspired to ante up for something so readily available for the price of enduring commercials and Foxs incessant on-air promotion. Happily the long-gestating movie itself offers a fine incentive and Foxs inspired marketing campaign (7-Eleven becoming Kwik-E-Mart? Genius) should ensure enough curiosity to stuff the studios pockets as it were with dollars from doughnuts. Put simply if somebody had to make a ""Simpsons"" movie this is pretty much what it should be -- clever irreverent satirical and outfitted with a larger-than-22-minutes plot capable (just barely) of sustaining a narrative roughly four times the length of a standard episode. On its face this is no small accomplishment. The conundrum of expanding a TV program (particularly of the animated variety) to feature size and scope has always posed a tricky proposition -- one conquered by the coarse laughs of ""Beavis and Butt-head Do America"" and ""South Park Bigger Longer and Uncut"" but resulting in disappointment with well just about everything else. Neither of those other properties however possesses the mass appeal of ""The Simpsons"" and the credited team of 11 writers (all of them at one time producers on the show) have incorporated plenty of knowing flourishes the audience will surely appreciate -- among them an especially smart bit at the outset directly addressing why anyone would pay ""to see something we get on TV for free."" Along the way the writers gleefully bite the hands that feed them at Fox dismiss Disney as an evil empire and lampoon U.S. government functionaries as inept buffoons who celebrate finally catching somebody theyre pursuing. Seizing on an environmental theme the plot hinges on rampant pollution of the local lake with the thoughtlessness of family patriarch Homer (Dan Castellaneta who provides no fewer than 10 different voices) yielding an epic screw-up imperiling the entire town of Springfield. Under ruthless bureaucrat Russ Cargill (Albert Brooks credited as A. Brooks) the Environmental Protection Agency declares the commu-nity a quarantined disaster area prompting the local citizenry to literally march on the Simpson residence with torches and force the whole brood into retreat. It thus falls to Homer to find a way to save the town in the process redeeming himself in the eyes of his wife Marge (Julie Kavner) and son Bart (Nancy Cartwright) who has grown to feel so neglected by dad that he takes refuge with Bible-thumping neighbor Ned Flanders (Harry Shearer). There are multiple side plots as well to help flesh out the story from Grandpa making an ominous prophecy to Homer adopting a pig to daughter Lisa (Yeardley Smith) being smitten with a guitar-playing Irish youth who shares her passion for environmentalism. For all of that the movie drags in places. Yet as is invariably the case with ""The Simpsons"" the smaller practically throwaway gags often provide the biggest laughs whether its Tom Hanks earnest cameo as himself a ""Titanic"" riff or Barts sure-to-be-talked-about skateboarding sequence yielding a fleeting but riotous glimpse of animated genitalia. (Despite a PG-13 rating the humor seldom feels more scabrous than an average episode.) Technically the movie capitalizes on its enhanced aspect ratio without altering the shows fundamental look though there are moments of computer-generated scale that clearly embrace the feature canvas employing more than the typical TV toolkit. ""The Simpsons Movie"" clearly represented a marketing challenge and given the build-up Fox appears to have been equal to that task. As for magnifying the series without losing its deeply ingrained charms the producers have mostly passed that test as well proving their 18-year-old child was ready to go out and face the big bad (theatrical) world.

TWITTER This is everything a fan of the 18-year-old animated Fox television series could ask for -- ""The Simpsons Movie"" looks like a winner for 20th Century Fox and Gracie Films. This review was written for the theatrical release of ""The Simpsons Movie."" ""The Simpsons Movie"" is everything a fan of the 18-year-old animated Fox television series could ask for. But then Homer Simpson opens the movie by calling everyone in the audience ""giant suckers"" for paying to see what they get for free on TV. Looks like the world is full of giant suckers. Maybe some will download the movie or buy a pirated version just to feel better about being suckers. Even calculating theft into the equation -- along with the possibility that more than a few nonfans might want to catch the Simpsons on the big screen -- ""The Simpsons Movie"" looks like a winner for 20th Century Fox and Gracie Films. In going for boxoffice gold the Simpsons trusted and loyal crew -- the multitude of writers producers and director David Silverman are series veterans -- have labored long and hard to make a movie that hearkens back to the vintage years of the series. Its caustic irreverent constantly amusing and a tiny bit rude. Not a lot though. This isnt the ""Beavis and Butt-Head"" or ""South Park"" movie. Its almost -- dare I say it -- charming. For awhile nothing much happens so you might think you are watching a TV segment blown up large. Grandpa makes a prophesy while speaking in tongues in church but no one can understand what he said. Then Homer gets it into his mind to acquire a pet pig. Cue the pig jokes some of which have already appeared in trailers. Article Templatehttp//link.brightcove.com/services/link/bcpid1119669402http//www.brightcove.com/channel.jsp?channel=769341148 Meanwhile a cute subplot finds Lisa the family conscience campaigning to clean up the hugely polluted Springfield lake. Against all odds she succeeds and the lake is declared off-limits to all dumpers. Even the local mafia agrees not to dump bodies there. But Homer hasnt paid any attention. So when it comes time to get rid of the pet pigs poop you know where he is going to pitch it. The result is the worst pollution in the U.S. This causes Environmental Protection Agency head Russ Cargill (nicely voiced by Albert Brooks) to convince President Schwarzenegger -- you have a problem with an Austrian accent? -- to put a giant unbreakable glass dome over the entire town. Boy are the town folks mad at the Simpsons now. A mob chases the family from its home. Using a sink hole discovered by baby Maggie the family escapes the dome and moves to Alaska. Cue the Alaska jokes which are among the weaker ones in the movie before everyone goes back to Springfield. Now Homer actually can save the town which Cargill means to blow up. Laughs come in all sizes -- large medium small and failed the latter happening only seldom. While little has been gained in bringing the Simpsons to the screen other than a bigger canvas requiring a much larger army of animators its still fun to enjoy the crew in this new setting. All the regular voice actors -- which include Dan Castellaneta Hank Azaria and Harry Shearer performing multiple roles as well as Julie Kavner Nancy Cartwright and Yeardley Smith -- are in fine form. The animation is still stiff TV animation but why mess with a familiar look? By the way Tom Hanks puts in a good-natured cartoon appearance and this pretty much sums up the Simpsons first foray into movies Its good-natured.
