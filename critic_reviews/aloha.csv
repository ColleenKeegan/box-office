With a sense of being somehow removed from the real world and the help of umbrella drinks and warm trade winds its a setting thats both familiar and yet exotic enough to offer a subtler version of the foreigners-finding-themselves-abroad narrative crystallized in films like Lost In Translation and Eat Pray Love.Cameron Crowes new film Aloha is the latest to recycle the magical-island trope in service of a goofy love story. But unlike its predecessors Aloha surprisingly gets a lot right in its depiction of Hawaii--mostly by showing respect for its traditions and people--even if its attempts at realism nonetheless clash with the inherently romantic view of island life built into the premise.Related Story Why Are Romantic Comedies So Bad? The film follows Brian Gilchrist (Cooper) a defense contractor who returns to Hawaii for a project launching a satellite into space. He reconnects with his ex-girlfriend (Rachel McAdams) whos now married to a comically un-talkative pilot (John Krasinski) and meets Allison Ng (Emma Stone) a manic-pixie fighter pilot whos purportedly a quarter-Hawaiian and a quarter-Chinese. The whole story is a tangled mess. Aloha sees itself as a quirky funny and sad but loudly announces when its trying to be those things while its attempts to develop its characters somehow feel strenuously lazy--like a driver who wastes an hour looking for a shortcut.Ahead of Alohas release Sony faced criticism from the Media Action Network for Asian Americans  for not featuring islanders or Asian Americans in speaking roles despite Hawaii being only 30 percent white. Theres some truth to the groups complaint that the film uses Hawaii as an ""exotic backdrop"" and the entire main cast is indeed white (Alec Baldwin Bill Murray and Danny McBride also make appearances). But MANAA neglected to mention that the film features Bumpy Kanahele a highly respected indigenous Hawaiian nationalist leader who plays himself. Kanahele speaks on his own turf and in his own words with Gilchrist and Ng about the problems and concerns of native Hawaiians before inviting them to eat and drink with the rest of the community. Its a touching if short-lived vignette that indisputably stems from genuine reverence and compassion for the people of Hawaii. Besides when was the last time a major motion picture even glanced at the lives of Americas indigenous people with something other than mockery?The film for all its frustrating narrative flaws gets other little things right too showing the islanders taking off their shoes before entering the house and highlighting the fraught relationship between Hawaiians and the U.S. military. (Aloha goes so far as to use the incredibly loaded term ""occupation"" giving voice to a controversial but forcefully held local viewpoint.) It also casts actual Hawaiians to play Native Hawaiian characters unlike 50 First Dates which had the noted character actor Rob Schneider play a shirtless marijuana-loving Hawaiian caricature named Ula.But its true that most of these characters dont have any lines which may give the unfortunate impression that Kanaheles just a local mouthpiece--or a symbol--shoehorned into the storyline. This is a point that will undoubtedly come off to many as an unnecessarily critical to many viewers. But to understand MANAAs frustration its important to remember that many Americans see Hawaii less as a real place than as a promise on a postcard already reduced to an abstraction and its native inhabitants even more so.Many Americans see Hawaii less as a real place than as a promise on a postcard reduced to an abstraction.Its hard too to defend Aloha against claims that it overly romanticizes Hawaii. The opening credits run over old-timey footage set to ukelele music--a kind of mood-collage approach that bogs down the rest of the film. (In place of realistic interactions Aloha often uses swelling music to signal that an emotional connection has taken place.) Many of the characters talk for no discernible reason about Hawaiian mythology--the gods Lono and Pele; the menehune or little people who live in the forests; the huakai po or warrior ghosts. Ng Stones character frequently comments on the mana (power or spiritual energy) of a particular area as if noting the feng shui of a room. Its within this vaguely magical supposedly authentic context that Coopers character manages to finally open up to others make amends for his past mistakes and of course get the girl.Given all this its easier to see Aloha for what it is a film that prioritizes the white American viewpoint just like the vast majority of films and TV shows that will come out this year. Which is not in itself an inherently bad thing and doesnt erase the films laudable progress. But even someone who isnt offended by stories set in predominantly non-white areas featuring mostly white actors can admit such stories are unrealistic. As a result unnecessarily ""whitewashed"" films like Aloha will encounter more and more pushback as time goes on because those stories will feel increasingly at odds with how Americans see the country they live in.  Of course attempts to diversify Hollywood will invariably lead to works that inspire cognitive dissonance. Anyone whos lived in Hawaii will feel an awkward mix of recognition and disillusionment when watching Aloha. As Coopers character explains with all the requisite cynicism that hell later be cured of ""Nobody wants to live where they are they want to live in a fantasy."" In this film  if not in life viewers arent forced to choose between myth and reality.

Twitter Email previousThe Bob the Builder Theory of Britains EU ReferendumnextDemocrats War on Women Attack Is Not Going Away Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Gary Cameron / Reuters Trump Time Capsule 62 A Man Who Can Be Baited With a Tweet James Fallows None Last night in her overall very successful acceptance speech Hillary Clinton said with ruthless precision about her opponent Ask yourself Does Donald Trump have the temperament to be Commander-in-Chief? Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride. Continue Reading Mark Kauzlarich / Reuters How Chelsea Beat Ivanka at Being a Candidate Daughter Michelle Cottle The comparatively less flashy less spirited former First Kid managed to show her moms softer side at the DNC on Thursday. Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side. Continue Reading Tom Pennington / Getty Images The Mind of Donald Trump Dan P. McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Chris Keane / Reuters North Carolinas Deliberate Disenfranchisement of Black Voters David A. Graham A federal appeals court finds the impact of the states voting law can only be explained by ""discriminatory intent."" Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz.

At the end of 2013 in the low-slung industrial Taiwanese city of Kaohsiung a bevy of officials came to attend the ribbon cutting of a huge former hotel that had undergone a top-to-bottom multimillion-dollar renovation. Speaking before the throngs of celebrants who blocked the flow of traffic Taiwans deputy director of the Ministry of the Interior praised the group that funded the renovation and presented them for the 10th year straight with the national ""Excellent Religious Group"" award. ""For years you have dedicated your time and lives to anti-drug work and human- rights dissemination"" said the director echoing praise offered by the mayors office and the presidents national-policy adviser. Continue Reading Mike Segar / Reuters The Most Inspiring and Depressing Moment of the Democratic Convention Uri Friedman The father of a Muslim American who died in Iraq confronts Donald Trump. Khizr Khan began his speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday with words I wish he didnt have to say ""Tonight we are honored to stand here as parents of Captain Humayun Khan and as patriotic American Muslims--as patriotic American Muslims with undivided loyalty to our country."" I wish he and his wife didnt have to stand there as the parents of a 27-year-old Army captain who was killed by suicide bombers while serving in the Iraq War. And I wish Khizr Khan hadnt felt the need to declare his patriotism and loyalty to the United States of America. Those truths should have been self-evident. The state of the union is not strong when an American feels compelled to clarify such things. In better times Khizr Khan who was born in Pakistan and moved to America from the United Arab Emirates might have begun his speech with what he said next ""Like many immigrants we came to this country empty-handed. We believed in American democracy--that with hard work and [the] goodness of this country we could share in and contribute to its blessings.""

But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon. Continue Reading Reuters Trump Time Capsule 63 Whats In the Tax Returns? James Fallows None Mark Salter former chief of staff to Sen. John McCain has written an essay for Real Clear Politics on why he cannot vote for Donald Trump. It deserves note for the long-term record because this is not how associates of a partys former nominee usually talk about the current one and because of its insistence on the importance of tax returns. Salter concludes (emphasis added) Could it be that a major party nominee for president is beholden to Russias leader and might compromise the security interests of the U.S. and our allies to maintain that relationship?  We dont know the answer.... We cant begin to answer the question until Trump releases his tax returns for the last several years. The media should make this the focus of every interview with Trump and senior Trump staff. The Republican Party chairman should urge him to release his returns. The Republican leadership in Congress should insist on it. Every American voter should demand it. There are legitimate suspicions about whether Trumps business relationships could compromise his loyalty to our country. Unless and until he puts them to rest not by dismissing them but by disproving them he should be considered unfit to hold the office of president.

Graham The State Department is reopening its investigation into Hillary Clintons emails just as she puts a Justice Department investigation behind her. Hillary Clinton is out of the frying pan and into the fire. On July 6 Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that the Justice Department would not pursue criminal charges against the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee for her use of a private email server at the State Department. But the following day with that criminal investigation closed the State Department reopened its own probe into the emails the AP reported. State Department spokesman John Kirby told the AP that it would be looking at potential mishandling of classified information by Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Former officials could face administrative sanctions including a loss of their security clearances--a step that would be both politically embarrassing for Clinton and complicate efforts to staff a national-security team should she prevail in November.

Comments (2) click to enlarge Aloha Video Rated PG-13  105 minutes  2015 Writer-director Cameron Crowe borrows from his own Jerry Maguire for this romantic comedy about a former NASA employee (Bradley Cooper) representing a billionaire megalomaniac (Bill Murray) in his quest to launch his own satellite from Honolulu. Upon arriving the hero reunites with a woman he almost married 13 years earlier (Rachel McAdams) and bickers with the all-business air force pilot (Emma Stone) whos been assigned to hover around him like a gnat. Crowe wants to tell us that the sky is magical Hawaii is magical and love is magical but the movie feels like something thats been sliced and diced with plot-pertinent bits of film left on the cutting-room floor. Even if this were well made in a technical sense it would still be a weird heap of patriotism astronomy and Hawaiian folklore piled atop a pat and predictable love story.

Entertainment ""Aloha"" Is The Worlds Most Bewildering Romantic Comedy Its got a gorgeous setting and a great cast that includes Bradley Cooper Emma Stone and Rachel McAdams. But heres where Aloha loses its way. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Neal Preston / Columbia Pictures Emma Stone and Bradley Cooper in Aloha ID 5850933 Say Anything... is a pop culture milestone -- John Cusack standing with the boombox over his head is one of the 80s most enduring images. Jerry Maguire? Infinitely quotable. And Almost Famous the best of Cameron Crowes big-hearted bunch is so earnest and open that it repels cynicism like a force field offering up a fervent tribute to being one of the uncool. Though at this point Crowe may be experiencing not just a few bad years but an entire bad decade hes more than earned his place in the sincere-cinema pantheon with this earlier work including Singles and Fast Times at Ridgemont High which he didnt direct but adapted from a book he wrote toward the end of his precocious journalist days. This is why Aloha which arrives in theaters already notorious thanks to leaked Sony emails signaling serious internal displeasure with the movie is so goddamn bewildering. Its not bad so much as alien like a romantic comedy made by someone whos researched human behavior but had very few brushes with it in person. It has a strong cast -- Bradley Cooper Emma Stone Rachel McAdams Bill Murray and John Krasinski -- and a familiar Crowe-type story about a disgraced man finding redemption thanks in part to the love of a wide-eyed woman. But the actual details are all totally confounding from the reason Cooper returns to Hawaii to why he left over a decade before to what his deal is in the first place to the exchanges of dialogue that are supposed to be fast and flirty but instead feel like something out of Mad Libs. Crowe who wrote and directed Aloha seems to have forgotten how to make a movie. Heres a closer look at its weirdness. ID 5842015 3. Bradley Cooper is disillusioned by his job which is totally incomprehensible. View this image > Neal Preston / Columbia Pictures ""There was a time I knew everything in the sky"" Coopers character Brian Gilcrest says in Alohas opening monologue He goes on to describe how he grew up joined the military then left it after the 2008 recession to take a sell-out defense contractor job -- a job that remains mystifying for the entire run of the movie but that apparently involves a lack of looking upward. Brian works for an eccentric billionaire named Carson Welch (Murray) and at various times seem to be a fixer an engineer a computer hacker a mercenary and a thief. Hes also a public relations whiz since when the movie begins hes been tasked with returning to Hawaii after a rough stretch in Afghanistan in order to persuade real separatist independence movement leader Dennis ""Bumpy"" Kanahele (playing himself) to bless a pedestrian gate. If it seems tough to hang the plot of a movie on this minor PR gesture Aloha does make an abrupt turn toward the end into being a film about how private companies are untrustworthy inadequate replacements for government-funded space programs -- fair enough but also nothing to do with what the movie until that point has been about. Theres no way to understand Brians disillusionment when its impossible to understand what hes doing in the first place. Meanwhile Danny McBride and Alec Baldwin play military higher-ups whove been transformed into corporate babysitters but who are mainly concerned about Brians romantic interest in Allison Ng (Stone) the officer whos been assigned to work with him while hes in town. ID 5849329 4. Emma Stone plays a fighter pilot whos one-quarter Native Hawaiian and one-quarter Chinese. View this image > Neal Preston / Columbia Pictures Aloha has already gotten preemptive flak for its lack of diversity and its appropriation of Hawaiian culture to tell the story of how a white dude gets his groove back. That flak is not unearned though these points dont come close to covering its many problems. The movie has an awareness of the states history and its makeup but nevertheless tells a story that leaves most of its characters of color in the background. Its approach to Hawaii might be best described as uneasy and misguided if well-meant from the kid (Jaeden Lieberher) whos obsessed with local myths and insists that Brian is the god Lono to the way that Kanahele and the Nation of Hawaii are used as shortcuts for authenticity mysticism and the moral high ground. But strangest of all is that the movie has Stone playing a character whos a quarter Hawaiian and a quarter Chinese and who talks about it all the time -- lily-white Emma Stone with her big green eyes flashing a picture of parents who look nothing like her and sitting in on a song with some native musicians. Its an utterly bemusing choice. Stones an extremely charming actress but giving her a light tan in no way turns her into a convincing mixed-race character and shes just not up for serving as a conduit of Hawaiian culture -- the main one in the movie which shows how deep its connection to credibility actually goes. Besides Stone has a tough enough task navigating a part that has her starting out all business but crumbling in Brians presence like so much tissue paper seeing tarnished greatness in him after a brief exchange in which he turns down her offer of a drink. Allison is written around these strong ideas -- shes a geekily enthusiastic fighter pilot whos matter of fact about her job intimidating potential dates -- but her place in the script turns out to be the depressingly standard one of helping a guy get back in touch with his inner greatness. ID 5850257 5. The flirty banter is borderline unintelligible. Video available at http//youtube.com/watch?v=HdprUafTrH4. youtube.com ""Why dont you just have what you want?"" Rachel McAdams who plays Brians ex-girlfriend Tracy Woodside says to him when he arrives at her house for dinner. Its an awkwardly worded offer of hospitality that allows Brian to counter with ""Do you have what you want?"" -- referring to Tracys life with her military husband Woody (John Krasinski) and two kids (Lieberher and Danielle Rose Russell). Aloha is filled with fast-paced clever-ish but not actually clever exchanges like this particularly between Tracy and Brian whose first meeting in 13 years is made up of dueling non sequiturs. ""Will you stop getting more beautiful?"" he asks and she responds by telling him he has to meet her kids which isnt really a brush-off any more than what he said was a come-on. Also her husband is right there having flown Brian in in the first place. Aloha has the rhythms of a screwball comedy without having the dialogue to match it. Fittingly one of its best conversations involves no words at all featuring a character whose introduction the movie unfortunately fumbles. It still works well enough that Aloha tries the trick again almost immediately afterward in a scenario where the silence makes no sense at all with another character who youd think would have many questions and whos not at all served by the quirk of the scenes staging. ID 5850638 6. The movie constantly tells you about its heros specialness without ever showing it. View this image > Neal Preston / Columbia Pictures Brian is supposed to be returning to Hawaii after more than a dozen years away -- a long time -- but everyone else in the movie acts as if theyve been on pause that whole time or if not have spent a lot of the interval talking and thinking about him. Everyone knows Brian or knows of him but its never really clear why hes so memorable why Tracys son would plead for him to come over for dinner why Allison acts like shes meeting a childhood hero why Woody gives off the vibe of a guy whod be helpless to keep his marriage intact if Brian made a move on his wife. Brian likes space. Hes worked on some sciencey projects. Hes played by Bradley Cooper. Hes not the long-awaited fulfillment of a Hawaiian arrival myth. Crowe has made movies before about men whove flamed out and who are working toward a comeback in Jerry Maguire in Elizabethtown. But Aloha is the most garbled version of this story from the nature of the flameout itself to the roles Brians love interest ex and ""old stomping ground"" play in his redemption. Its a movie that treats its world as something thats only there to help its protagonist find himself which is evidence enough that its time for Crowe to figure out a new story to tell.

The gifted writer-director of Say Anything . . . Singles Jerry Maguire and Almost Famous (his Oscar-winning script detailed his job as a teen reporter for this magazine) has been gobsmacked by leaked Sony e-mails that pointed to intense studio disgruntlement with the film. Then the Media Action Network for Asian-Americans accused Aloha of presenting a ""whitewashed"" version of Hawaii that excluded ""the very people who live there."" Hmm. Actually Aloha blasts the military-industrial complex repped in the film by Alec Baldwin and Bill Murray for disenfranchising the very people who live there by exploiting the 50th states land and air rights for profit and worse.

Bradley Cooper plays Brian Gilcrest a combat-scarred defense contractor back in Honolulu to reconnect with the space program. Hed like to reconnect with former love Tracy (Rachel McAdams) but shes now a mom and married to pilot Woody (John Krasinski). Then theres Allison Ng (Emma Stone) Brians Air Force handler who irritates him with her series of ""warmest alohas"" until he sees her true self a staunch defender of Hawaiians against the encroachments of Brians employer Carson Welch (Murray) a fat cat eager to militarize Hawaiian air space by launching a weapons satellite. Yikes. Its a top-flight cast but Cooper offers too little to Stones too much. Only McAdams finds a touching balance. As for Murray hes a joy cutting loose to Hall and Oates but when the plot takes him to a dark place the effect feels forced. Crowe is tracing a blueprint set by his mentor Billy Wilder whose 1948 romance A Foreign Affair took a derisive look at the black market in postwar Berlin. But Crowe doesnt share Wilders cynicism in the face of the American instinct to despoil. He wants things to work out to let the good guys win. Thats wish fulfillment. Aloha runs from the fires it ignites. Thats a shame. Topics Emma Stone Cameron Crowe Bradley Cooper Dont Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox.

Photo Neal Preston/Columbia Cameron CrowesA AlohaA is a delightful disaster -- the kind of catastrophe that might also remind you why you loved a certain filmmaker in the first place. Crowes been in the wilderness for some years. Movies likeA Jerry MaguireA Almost Famous andA Say AnythingA are now distant memories; in recent years hes made mostly duds. At first glanceA AlohaA has plenty of elements in common with his earlier classics. It feels like an attempt to bring back the ambitious personal romantic-comedy form which the writer-director once helped to perfect. But like someone whos been stranded in a distant land for too long the film arrives with both too much and too little to say. It comes at us in choppy bursts of brilliance and dopiness. That is at once its great charm and its great curse. ""There was a time when I knew everything in the sky"" Bradley Coopers Brian Gilcrest tells us in voice-over early on in the film. ""As a kid I looked up and I felt the future. It belonged to me."" Its a theme that will get repeated ad nauseam. Brian was once a dreamer then a soldier and pilot then a military contractor. He now works for a TED-talking Bono-befriending tech billionaire (Bill Murray bringing his usual ""who me?""-ness) who wants to send his own satellite into orbit; the skies Brian tells us now belong to the billionaires. When he arrives in Hawaii Brians intent is to get a local tribe to ""bless"" a gate -- a vague-sounding and vaguely expressed goal. What it essentially means is that Brians boss will be able to build new factories and send more birds up into the skies over the islands. Escorting Brian on his journey is Allison Ng (Emma Stone) a beautiful Air Force pilot who seesaws between by-the-book formality and complete forthrightness She addresses him as ""Sir"" but also wants eagerly to talk about their common loves -- ""the sky the future everything."" Brian isnt having it ""Let this be our longest conversation"" he says cutting her off just as shes getting started. Hes still pining on some level for Tracy Woodside (Rachel McAdams) to whom he was once almost engaged but who is now married with two kids to another pilot the eerily quiet and often absent Woody (John Krasinski). Its a not-quite love quadrangle There are still some sparks between Tracy and Brian but we know the film will focus more on getting Brian and Allison together and then driving them apart. Allison after all is the one who represents that sense of wonder our hero has since lost. Thats the structure anyway -- to the extent that there is any discernible structure in Aloha. Brian and Allison actually fall for each other pretty quickly. Other predictable plot points arrive with halfhearted regularity. At times you cant help but wonder if someone took Crowes footage and tried to turn it into an introductory Save the Cat exercise. You also cant help but wonder if maybe theres a wonderful three-hour cut of this somewhere. Whats onscreen now alas feels like a vaguely connected mishmash of stuff. With Woody gone for much of the time Tracy is hungry for companionship; but she still cant forgive Brian for abandoning her many years ago. The tech billionaires plans for space may be less than entirely noble. There is a random flashback to something that happened to Brian in Kabul. Alec Baldwin shows up as a blustery Air Force general who dances to ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"" and tells us that the U.S. military now just services the wealthy ""This is the new military captain If Kesha wants to launch a rocket she probably could."" But theres something in that madness still. Throughout the first half at least you may find yourself enraptured by the films awkwardness -- the way characters speak in logorrheic spurts as if they dont quite have a handle on what theyre trying to say. Allison is not the only one trying to balance explosive honesty and clipped reserve; everybody in the movie is holding (or failing to hold) something back. The movie itself embodies that conflict. As with The CounselorA -- another recent flop from a great director fallen on hard times -- Aloha is a film that for all its problems cant help but be its ragged wounded hopelessly romantic self. Quite appropriately the elemental properties of nature and myth keep intruding. Forests loom dark and deep the wind blows windows and doors open and characters struggle against their impulses -- impulses both noble and base. Theres also much discussion of iridium flares and night-watching and Hawaiian gods who have revenge sex in volcanos and turn into teardrops. The dialogue awkwardly repeatedly spells out basic plot points but then the film turns around and expresses some of its most important revelations without any words at all; at one point two characters speak entirely in subtitles. Crowes earlier films -- the ones on which he built his reputation -- often feel like the work of a man younger than his years but one who nevertheless fears a dark future. Theyre paeans to love and idealism but they also understand that the world has little time for such things. Haltingly messily uncertainly Aloha stands on the other side of that divide looking back wistfully on that idealism. Its a movie struggling with its very essence. Watching that struggle however is surprisingly entertaining.A Tagsmovie reviewmoviesalohacameron crowebradley cooperemma stonerachel mcadamsMore Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories What Do the Women of Cleveland Want From Melania Trump?

"Whose Fault Is This? Learning to Like the Mega-quakes in San Andreas and the Sloppiness of Aloha << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Whose Fault Is This? Learning to Like the Mega-quakes in San Andreas and the Sloppiness of Aloha Warner Bros. Movies May 29 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print San Andreas has the same kind of preposterousness as its super-quakes You dont want to be crushed by a flying shipping container but what choice do you have? My brain ran for its life until it could run no more having been fully concussed by action ""plot"" and well-filled scoop-neck tank tops. You want to be better than this movie and you are. But when Dwayne Johnson and Carla Gugino are piloting a speedboat up the belly of a tsunami swerving out of the way of the ship from Captain Phillips all you can think is what and wheeeee and phew. ""Better"" feels pretty dumb. The earth of San Andreas cleaves itself open to us like the devils sunroof. Who are we not to leap into the void? This is a movie that in less than two hours merrily undoes almost every item on the U.S. Geological Surveys Earthquake Facts amp; Earthquake Fantasy page. For instance An earthquake on the San Andreas fault can cause a large tsunami. The USGS says hell no ""The San Andreas fault cannot create a big tsunami like the ones that happened in Sumatra in 2004 or Japan in 2011. Those earthquakes happened on subduction zone faults on which ... "" Blah blah blah counters San Andreas. The movie reserves its most prurient destruction for San Francisco where Im sure the filmmakers think subduction is a culinary trend gay bar or type of yoga -- or all three. In any case nobody involved cares about what earthquakes are or arent. They are something to behold especially in 3-D which the movie puts to relatively tasteful good use. So whats our story? This being a disaster movie you get a bunch. At the California Institute of Technology Dr. Paul Giamatti labors on an earthquake prediction model that his partner Dr. Kim Park (Will Yun Lee) has a hunch might be working. [You can totally hear the USGS Um guys ... ] They run off to the Hoover Dam where a cluster of tiny quakes turns into the Big One wrecking the dam and devouring Dr. Kim. Devastated Giamatti somehow gets back to his office in Pasadena and uses a news reporter (Archie Punjabi) to warn the world that this thing isnt over and is headed for the East Coast. [USGS Come on. Seriously?] Meanwhile Chief Ray Gaines (Johnson) saves lives as a Los Angeles Fire Department helicopter-rescue pilot. He had plans to drive his allegedly teenaged daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario) to a volleyball tournament in the Bay Area. But hes got to go to Nevada to deal with the dam which super-well-adjusted Blake is cool with. Anyway his divorce papers just came in the mail and hes sad having just run a hand over some old family photos of a trip to San Francisco which happened before their other daughter died in what flashbacks reveal to be some kind of whitewater rafting disaster that he couldnt stop. Now his ex Emma (Gugino) and Blake are moving in with Emmas new beau a businessman named Dan Riddick (Ioan Gruffudd living up to the ""dick"" part). Chief Ray is furious that he has to find this out from Dan who also boasts that hell take Blake to the tournament. And he does -- in a private jet. [USGS OK not our business here but are you kidding with this?] On his way to take the chopper for a tune-up before he heads to Nevada Ray calls Emma and apologizes for being mad. [USGS Hey is the dam an emergency or what?] He phones just in time -- not because the earthquake destroys the top-floor restaurant where Emma is lunching but because her lunch date is an icy bitch played by Kylie Minogue whos having a good time giving a terrible performance. (Her exit is the movies most wittily awful.) Ray flies over to pick Emma up from the collapsing skyscraper. But considering all the leaping and running and climbing that a very fit Gugino does he may as well be fetching her from the gym. Ordinarily Chief Ray would totally be headed for a Taken movie in which Dan would be a sex trafficker or a terrorist. Here in an earthquake movie hes the next best thing a real estate developer. On the flight up to San Francisco Blake asks why he doesnt have kids. I do he says and instead of adding ""You Blake"" he presents her with property brochures. [USGS Its us again. Forget it. This is amazing.] While hes upstairs doing deals she waits in the lobby and endures the timid advances of a mushy British guy named Ben (Hugo Johnstone-Burt) whos looking for a job with Dan. Hes so wobbly that she and his little brother Ollie (Art Parkinson) have to practically show him how to hit on her. When they wind up fleeing falling debris and weathering more quakes together Blake also has to show this pile of tears and fears how to survive. The depiction of British wimpiness is so vivid and unrelenting that it makes Magic Negro and Sassy Latina seem as noble as White Savior. (Gruffudd is Welsh doing another iffy American accent.) At some point poor Ollie says to pathetic Ben ""Blakes going to die isnt she?"" Its as if the films writer Carlton Cuse were trolling John Oliver to mock-identify with the accuracy of the depiction. Ben gets a girl whom he seems constitutionally incapable of saving. When he tries to smash a window another character waves him away in exasperated despair so that she can do it. Heres another action movie this season after Mad Max Fury Road that turns white men into hood ornaments for vehicles driven by women. (Asians though will still have to wait to put on a cape. The heroics of Lees Dr. Kim are completely self-sacrificing. He heaves a little blonde girl into Giamattis arms then tells her to avert her eyes before the rumbling concrete swallows him up. Lee lasts two early scenes so naturally the costume department gives him the Star Trek treatment and puts him in a red shirt.) Johnson mostly performs daring feats of pretending to drive things into and away from danger. (This guy changes his mode of transportation more often than award-show MCs change outfits. The parachute sequence with a petrified Gugino is my favorite.) Johnson gets to do a couple of borderline embarrassing emotional scenes save some people on the street and when Gugino asks ""What are we going to do?"" say stuff like ""Were gonna get our daughter"" in a tone that makes you think shes been kidnapped. But that line brings down the house in part because it highlights the ridiculousness of the stakes here all this determination trained on one self-sufficient girl. Its all so morally overblown that the movie is shoved into the disaster-movie camp of the Airport films Volcano and anything directed by Roland Emmerich. Really camp is visible right from the opening scene a cheap sub-Jan de Bont/Paul Verhoeven-style gag in which a blondes distracted driving is punished not by an oncoming truck but by rocks loosened by the fault lines idea of foreplay. The movie works at making Blake seem like a daughter worth the effort unlike the Kims of 24 and the Taken movies. What Blake appears to lack in Rays DNA (shes neither brown nor enormous) she makes up for in resourcefulness. Its not a great character but shes not insulting either which is interesting. The movie is a smart kind of stupid. Its 114 minutes whiz by along the way meeting many of the requirements for something like this to work Is the emotional center made of Velveeta? Will actual scientists carp? Does the White House explode or does an airborne cow go spinning across the screen? Yes some version of most of all that happens in San Andreas -- except the last one. A lot of what keeps the movie campy is that it feels oddly cheap. Its several rungs above last summers lousy tornado movie Into the Storm and far beneath the majestic dimensionality of George Millers Fury Road. Theres no standout set piece in San Andreas. Its an album with no single. I remember the boat on the tsunami but vaguely. The movie doesnt really stop to take enough of it in. Michael Bay would have found a way to get 15 minutes from those 15 seconds and the difference feels more like a matter of budget than a director capitalizing on the thrill of concision. The scale of Millers film might be an affront to the credibility of other movies productions. Fury Road seems handmade the stunts done on the spot. The movie is one set piece. Its all vision. You feel it. The effects in San Andreas might be state-of-the-art but theres something amateurish and hasty about the way theyre shot and assembled. At some point Gugino falls several floors and crashes onto a panel of concrete rooftop but you dont get to marvel at it. Its plow-plow-plow lots of dust cut away to her coming to as the sound design simulates her disorientation. Disaster movies dont need vision or filmmaking per se. Indeed the high of these movies -- why theyre better than postapocalypse films (Millers excepted) -- is that theres no time or reason to think whereas with dystopia stories theres nothing else to do. And all that lacking -- of vision of aptitude of acting (the performances here are a house over from those of Sharknado; sorry Kylie) -- compounds the straightforward and backhanded fun. Ive gone this long and havent even mentioned the director. His name is Brad Peyton and he seems to have cribbed from Verhoeven and de Bont and Renny Harlin. The sexy unfurling of an American flag will make Bay leap to his feet and recite the Pledge of Allegiance. Peyton furnishes shots of the unmolested San Francisco skyline that are like a wolfs watering mouth as the predator surveys a henhouse. But whats there left to do for a director on a movie like this? Peyton is making sure everyone meets the height requirement before pressing the button that starts the ride.  Columbia Pictures The weekend was supposed to bring two disaster films the other one being Aloha Cameron Crowes allegedly execrable romantic dramedy with Bradley Cooper as a military consultant in love. Since at least late last year people have been stabbing the movie in the front. Its messy and shapeless and entirely characterized by the grating alacrity of privilege. But its a safe distance from Crowes lowest moments including Vanilla Sky which made money and has its defenders and Elizabethtown which bombed and has virtually none. Crowes idealism needs a suitable home with actors who understand how to play it the way everybody did in Say Anything... and Jerry Maguire and some people did in We Bought a Zoo. I like Aloha the way I like say Steven Spielbergs Always in which the ghost of Richard Dreyfuss gets a hot firefighter to look after his girl (Holly Hunter). Its a minor entertainment thats got stars near the height of their powers. All of this sentimentality should be embarrassing yet its not only that. Aloha asks you to believe for instance that Emma Stone is a quarter Asian. (Daddario makes more sense as the daughter of the Rock.) And the major event that happens in space would have far more dramatic fallout than this one appears to. But charm is a powerful trait in a movie and this movie uses charm as a fragrant disinfectant of both criticism and cynicism which is probably cynical too. If you can get Cooper Stone and Rachel McAdams on the same page it shouldnt matter what youre using to do the creative equivalent of cleaning your house. The plot has the simple-yet-really-difficult quality of a Terrence Malick movie while having none of the artistry. After years away and some trouble in Afghanistan Coopers contractor Brian Gilcrest has come back to Hawaii to do the bidding of a billionaire (Bill Murray) who with the militarys backing wants to launch a satellite into space. Stay tuned for why (then explain it to me). Hes assigned Allison Ng (Stone) a chipper naive Air Force captain to remain at his side. She gets on his nerves and then improbably into his heart. They banter their way into some kind of relationship even as it seems like Brian is still stuck on Tracy (McAdams) whom he once dated. Tracy does high-priority work that necessitates a lab coat has two painfully adorable kids and is married to a cryptic pilot (John Krasinski) whos never home rarely speaks when he is and has a sinking feeling that somethings going to happen between his wife and her ex. All Brian does in this movie is negotiate whether its negotiating over land with a native Hawaiian tribal chief played by the actual nationalist activist Bumpy Kanahele (more or less as himself) or negotiating with the women. You can feel someone trying to shave away some of the films shagginess. Whoever did that missed some spots. But that person has also shorn what I imagine could be construed as filmmaker vanity. Whats left is like a deluxe high-calorie version of NBCs Wings or a show that would run for eight interesting 24-minute episodes on HBO. Otherwise it seems like a movie that someone had to sift for during editing. You get the sense that what the filmmakers were looking for was another Jerry Maguire a film whose earnestness has variety and some edge. Here self-congratulatory do-gooderism predominates in matters of both the heart and nuclear armament. Its like Food Co-op The Movie. You know Crowes not going to bite you (although Alec Baldwin does show up for three scenes as a general whose pot boileth over). What you want with Crowe is for the niceness to penetrate. Youd like to see the sap turn into a more refined sugar. You want lines like ""Your bad moods are unconvincing"" and ""I go hard I go deep and sometimes I break things"" not to send you to the dentist. Barring that someone who can speak Crowes language really helps. McAdams might be the best hes ever had. Cooper and Stone do all the requisite twinkling even though someone here seems to think Goldie Hawn would have been even better in Private Benjamin if Judy were too competent. Cooper has reached his cruising altitude as a star. He makes Crowes droopier dialogue work for him. McAdams puts the perfect amount of air in her lines giving the words a lightness that conflates optimism amusement and resignation. Shes never seemed lovelier more instinctive or more present even though you get the sense there used to be a lot more of her performance. None of this ""works."" But it usually worked on me. Crowe has come up with a couple of good spats and relaxed adult conversations (people talk here; they listen). Its true that Crowes films no longer appear to have much coherent to say. Honestly all I ever ask myself when I watch one of his movies is Why doesnt he just make a musical? Theres a long passage here set at a Christmas party in which Stone and Murray dance to the Gap Bands ""Outstanding"" which is six-plus minutes of mid-tempo heaven. Crowe lets most of the song play out and until Baldwins general cuts it off (for ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"") theres nobody elses mess Id rather be standing in.

Neal Preston/Sony Pictures Entertainment/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide Hawaii is always nice to look at. Thats about the best thing I can say for ""Aloha"" Cameron Crowes genial but tepid romantic comedy starring Bradley Cooper as defense contractor Brian Gilcrest and Emma Stone as Allison the Air Force pilot assigned to watch out for him as he massages a deal to approve the island as a launching pad for a billionaire-funded space satellite. The billionaire played with extra smarm by Bill Murray is no peacenik - his real goal is to weaponize the heavens in the process of owning them.These Space Age machinations dont really jibe with the films romantic core which involves Brians reunion with Rachel McAdamss Tracy an old flame. She is now married to a pilot (John Krasinski) a strong-and-silent type who is so nonverbal that in the films best moment the meaning of his muteness is rendered in subtitles. Crowe is deft at keeping the various plots spinning but there are too many of them and they dont intersect pleasingly. Grade C+ (Rated PG-13 for some language including suggestive comments.)

Its one of the finer riffs in writer-director Cameron Crowes romantic-comedy ""Aloha"" which stars Bradley Cooper as the contractor who arrives at Hawaiis Hickam Air Force Base with unfinished as well as unforeseen business. If Woody played by John Krasinski is the strong silent type creator Crowe is a man of many words. Some of his best have made a lasting impression pop-culturally speaking ""You had me at hello "" and ""Show me the money"" came from 1996s ""Jerry Maguire."" So did ""Help me ... help you"" a personal favorite. And though none are as sticky as those hes penned some fine exchanges for ""Aloha."" Crowe is also astute about the role silence can play in a movie. He doesnt just ask us to watch he requires we listen. He demands the same of his characters. Theres a reason the wind whips up rustles the treetops and shuts up the bickering characters played by Cooper and Emma Stone. As snappy as the banter can be between Gilcrest and his assigned handler Senior Capt./Maj. Select Alison Ng its the scenes in which little is said that often exert the most charm in ""Aloha."" WATCH Lisa Kennedys review of ""Aloha"" When he lands in Honolulu Gilcrest is a tarnished Air Force vet whos gone on to work in the private sector. Hes got a limp he earned in Afghanistan after a private a job for billionaire Carson Welch (Bill Murray) went south. As the F-22 ace tasked with getting him to a ribbon-cutting Stones Ng is crisp almost ridiculously efficient. Theres a little Rosalind Russell in Stones character. And their early interactions have the kind of bite to them that reminds moviegoers that Crowe is a practicing fan of the screwball comedy and its typically tart/smart hook-ups. The characters here come with complications. In one of her warmest turns in years Rachel McAdams is luminous as Tracy. Somethings gnawing at her -- about her marriage as well as Gilcrests arrival -- and Crowe gets at that mystery with patience. Its a gift to an intelligent audience when a filmmaker doesnt set up one character as easy foil to the protagonist. A very amiable Krasinski makes Woody worth rooting for. If it seemed obvious whom Gilcrest would wind up with when Ng picked up him on the tarmac at the start of ""Aloha"" it becomes less so as the story moves them closer but also creates hurdles romantic and professional. Alec Baldwin portrays the bellowing Gen. Dixon. Danny McBride amuses as Col. ""Fingers"" Lacy. Murray has wry fun as Welch the mercurial billionaire and Gilcrests employer who arrives on base for a clandestine project. Hes the kind of upper-upper-echelon entrepreneur who likes spouting theories about power and leadership and has a foxy Bos-well in tow to record them. When he requests Tears for Fears ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"" at a holiday party its not entirely clear whether hes going for irony or not. This is a romantic comedy that has more than hearts on its mind. In addition to teasing the uneasy and complicated partnership of the military and the private sector Crowe takes on issues integral to Hawaii. The opening credits begin with a montage of newsreel-style images of Hawaii around the time it became the 50th state and the militarys space-program efforts. When Gilcrest and Ng travel to a rural commune to get a Hawaiian blessing for a checkpoint their visit has the feel of a trek to a reservation to meet with a tribal council. Crowe cast Dennis ""Bumpy"" Kanahele -- leader of Hawaiis sovereignty movement -- as the head of that community.

His heroes always must filibuster regular life with their decency. Superficially these acts and speeches are performed in the direction of a woman who is given a chance to respond when the man has finished. But the acts/speeches are never about her -- instead theyre about how she has freed the man up enough to dare to say or do the things hes saying and doing. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - ""You had me at hello"" she might say when he peters out because to a woman in a Cameron Crowe movie the specifics of a lovers words or feelings dont matter just so long as theyre aimed at her. In Aloha which is as risible as youve heard it is Bradley Coopers character only speaks his heart to Emma Stones after covering her face in a comically oversized hat. Then spared the intimacy of her eyes he spews his movie-talk poetry letting her know that they must be together. For a long time she says nothing but she does deliver a verdict a single tear tumbling slowly below the brim of that hat.The plot a baffler keeps these two apart for another 40 minutes but that moment is the films only coherent climax. Its also possibly the most telling onscreen example of Cameron Crowes junior-high ideas about romance. In your youth did you ever find the courage to profess your love to someone you werent certain loved you back? If so you might have spoken into a void perhaps on the phone -- into silence you maybe strained to fill with everything beautiful inside you. That silence was about your own feelings of course and how much you loved their simple purity and how with an artful declaration you might win your target over. It was about some need to get him or her or the world itself to listen to appreciate your niceness to fall in love with how much you loved maybe to cry one beautiful tear.Film Details Aloha RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time105 min. More Info Trailer Cameron Crowe writes movies like hes calling us in eighth grade with his heart on fire. Heres how Stones character describes Coopers early in Aloha ""a brilliant compelling innovative commanding wreck of a guy."" Doesnt that sound like the most generous review that Crowe could have hoped for with Elizabethtown or We Bought a Zoo? Does he feel that we fail him when unlike his female leads we dont embrace the wrecks? Does it hurt him that we dont pull a hat over our eyes and let him move us with how moved he is?In Aloha he even attempts to one-up his greatest hit. You liked John Cusack demonstrating his sincerity by holding a boombox toward Ione Skye? Wait until you see Cooper prove himself to Stone by uploading the entire history of recorded sound into an evil satellite owned by Bill Murray. Yes that actually happens in the movie occasioning a quick survey of pop music Crowe likes; and no it makes no more sense in context. Cusack blasted a song toward Skye; Cooper blasts all songs ever into the sky for Stone who until this moment has been mad at him. But now impressed she holds his hand as they both stare straight ahead at a computer screen -- hes shown her he deserves her with an act so much more grand than say looking at her or regarding her or letting her talk. Her characters just another Almost Famous Band-Aid expending her youth so that a man can be great.The movies specifics are tough to follow perhaps due to studio cuts and re-editing. Stones character a fighter pilot is for some reason tasked with showing Coopers an aerospace engineer around Hawaii while Coopers character helps persuade native Hawaiians (repped by real-life activist and descendant-of-royalty Dennis ""Bumpy"" Kanahele) to allow the tech billionaire played by Murray to build a platform to launch rockets. Or something. Its all stubbornly vague with lots of insultingly cute links to Hawaiian folklore. One character suggests Cooper might be a reincarnated island god which is just a hair less ridiculous than the fact that Stones characters last name is Ng -- shes part Chinese part Hawaiian and yet still all Gwen Stacy.Complicating matters is Rachel McAdams as an ex of Coopers character -- might her young daughter be his? John Krasinski turns up as Cameron Crowes idea of a stoic silent soldier and he and Cooper get two could-have-been-good scenes of silent masculine communication. They arent good because Krasinski and Crowe lack the gravity to pull this idea off but at least for once its a guy who shuts up.Murray is playing something of a Bond villain but he and Stone have the movies best moment They dance at an officers club to ""I Cant Go for That"" with great goony energy -- its the only time any of Crowes men share a moment with her rather than impose one on her. The leads do what they can but in this final cut either seems capable of any random feeling or eruption at any time. Why does Cooper howl like a dog out the window of a car? Why does Stones character tell her mother that this engineer shes just met seems like a great guy -- immediately after hes been cruel to her? What are they fighting about when they fight in the woods? Why does this movie which takes place over five days start before Christmas end after Christmas and not have Christmas in it?3 Photo by Neal Preston Ellen Page Kidnaps an Infant in Tallulah but She Means Well NEXT Contact Alan Scherstuhl Follow studiesincrap Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Of course he had made that wonderful tribute about growing up learning to write and loving rock. And before that ""Jerry Maguire."" And before that the ahead-of-the-curve ""Singles"" and classic ""Say Anything"" - all of it made possible by his screenplay of his own book ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High."" And then what happened? ""Vanilla Sky"" which took a smart Spanish movie and covered it up with Hollywood gloss. ""Elizabethtown"" which took a small idea and smothered it under at least 40 extra minutes of meandering. ""We Bought a Zoo"" which - well probably paid some bills. ""Aloha"" though signals a small return. Its got some of Crowes signature weaknesses. It has a few too many characters and some trouble finding the narrative. And it depends too heavily on one of Crowes favorite cliches the manic-pixie-dream-girl - you know the adorable eccentric who exists solely to pull the leading man out of his funk. But at least theyre his weaknesses. At least this feels like a Cameron Crowe movie. The story features Bradley Cooper back in his old cheerful-conniver mode as Brian Gilcrest a rocket scientist - no literally sort of - who in these days of NASA decline is now working for an independent military-contractor-slash-tech-guru. And typically clumsily it takes Crowe too long to establish all this even with some narration (which never appears again) and a subplot about some new military construction in Hawaii which seems there only to provide Gilcrest with an USAF liason Captain Ng. (Although some of the confusion may be due to heavy studio-ordered edits.) But then the movie starts to take shape - as Ng falls for Gilcrest. And Gilcrest runs into an ex-lover who hes been avoiding for 13 years and who - though now married with kids - has all sorts of emotional baggage shes eager to unpack. And this is where Crowe starts to get back in his old groove - as his smart verbal funny characters (Im going to take a wild guess that he grew up on screwball comedies) have love scenes that sound like arguments and arguments that play like love scenes. Hes not home-free though. Cooper is very good and Rachel McAdams is as warmly vulnerable as ever as his ex-girl. But there are some problems with Captain Ng. Of course one problem is that - even though shes identified as Eurasian even though she explains her mother was Scandinavian - Emma Stone? Really? This isnt color-blind casting. This is just - blind. But thats not the real difficulty. The real difficulty is Ng herself. Theres no reason for her to be in this story - why would a fighter pilot be assigned as basically a civilians handler? And worse Crowe has written her as a completely unbelievable mix of sir-yes-sir military stickler and girly gushing romantic mystic. But shes not here to be a real person. Shes here - like most of the heroines in Crowes movies - to be the adorable sprite who saves the hero. How nice for her.Still as painful as it is to see Stone wasted like this there are other pleasures here even besides Cooper and McAdams. Theres Crowes still untouched skill at putting together a tasty pop soundtrack. Theres a nice turn by Bill Murray as the weapons profiteer and another one by John Krasinski as McAdams big macho definitely non-verbal spouse. Theres a strong impassioned feel for Hawaiian culture and myth and its independent spirit. And theres the sense that maybe - not just yet but maybe and getting closer all the time - Cameron Crowe may still redeem that faith in him that some of us have been holding onto for 15 long years. Ratings note The film contains some strong language and alcohol abuse. Aloha (PG-13) Sony (100 min.) Directed by Cameron Crowe. With Bradley Cooper Emma Stone Rachel McAdams.

(NEAL PRESTON /Sony Pictures Entertainment)By Steven Rea Inquirer Movie CriticPosted May 30 2015Music has always been essential to Cameron Crowes movies the gigging and groupies of Almost Famous the Peter Gabriel boom-box moment in Say Anything the classic rock of Jerry Maguire. The music in the writer-directors Aloha too is key from the swaying ukuleles of Hawaiian folk songs to the Who the Rolling Stones and Fleetwood Mac.But another sound is prominent in Crowes 50th State rom-com the drip-drop of flop sweat.For all the screwball patter smart-aleck similes and zingy one-liners that Crowe has handed his mismatched cast a kerplunking emptiness runs through Aloha.Bradley Coopers Brian Gilcrest a military contractor dogged by some bad history in Afghanistan arrives at Hickam Field in Pearl Harbor with a simple assignment to oversee the blessing of a new gate for the base built on sacred ground. He eyeballs his old girlfriend Tracy (Rachel McAdams) who now has two kids and a husband in the Air Force the taciturn Woody (John Krasinski). She eyeballs Brian back. A simple offer of a drink is filled with longing and regret.But one love interest wont do. Up trots Emma Stones Allison Ng a USAF fighter pilot who has been dispatched to ""babysit"" Brian while hes in Hawaii. If Stone seems impossibly young to 1) be flying F-22s and 2) be wooing the Coop she nonetheless looks dashing in uniform and she gets to be tough and swoony and play the guitar with a tribal king on a mountaintop.Crowe lets Ng claim one-quarter Hawaiian ancestry - to show her affinity for the ""myth and story"" of the Native People. But like so many of the defining traits and quirky details Crowe has assigned his characters this one is hard to swallow. (An Asian American group has condemned Aloha for its absence of key roles for Asian-Pacific Islanders. Guess they didnt hear about Stones characters indigenous heritage.)Along with the dueling Cooper/McAdams and Cooper/Stone love angles Aloha offers a muddle of plot about that Air Force base blessing and some cyber-intrigue to do with a rocket launch funded by a billionaire. Bill Murray sporting fashionable shades and spouting pronouncements to a leggy biographer (the dialogueless Ivana Milicevic) is said cad.Danny McBride wiggles his fingers nervously as the base commander. And Alec Baldwin storms in in a fit of pique as a four-star general. He gets to call Cooper ""Mr. Three-Day-Old Beard Boy"" - which is easily the snappiest line in the film. sreaphillynews.com 215-854-5629Steven_Rea Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""http//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> comments powered by Disqus Commenting policy | Comments FAQ FEATURED ARTICLESApothecary gardens fuel farm-to-medicine-cabinet movementTiffany Trump and Naomi Biden graduate Penn dad and granddad looking onPowerball fever Jackpot rises to 900 millionMoreDe Mazia Art Brings 2.38 MillionLeader Of Jbm Sentenced To Life Aaron Jones Was Convicted Of Conspiring To Distribute 100 Million In Cocaine.

And Emma Stone. And Bill Murray How bad can it be if its got Bill Murray?Pretty bad. Apparently Bill Murray is not the cure for everything. Especially not this script.This is a romantic comedy in which a mad billionaire (Murray) tries to fill outer space with nuclear bombs under his control. ""Wheres the romance or comedy in that?"" you ask. Exactly. Its like adding Dr. Evil to ""Sleepless in Seattle.""Cooper plays Brian Gilcrest a government contractor who returns to his Hawaiian homeland to smooth the way for the billionaires secret space program. Immediately upon landing he encounters his long-abandoned girlfriend Tracy (Rachel McAdams) who is now married to another old friend Woody (John Krasinski). Gilcrest is also introduced to his official handler the overeager Capt. Ng (Stone).From there the film becomes a splatter of random quirks. Gilcrest may be an ancient Hawaiian myth come to life ... until that storyline is dropped. He and Ng have knowing conversations that are hard to interpret. Ng suddenly sits down with some actual native Hawaiian people -- this movie has very few such folk -- for a painfully cliched singalong.A colonel (Danny McBride) does twitchy things with his hands Woody apparently communicates psychically and Ng and Gilcrest encounter warrior ghosts while driving down a road. Then the two are in love then theyre not; then they are then theyre not ... and then suddenly with no set-up hes a world-class computer genius.Whaaaat?Writer-director Cameron Crowe has done good work (""Say Anything"" ""Jerry Maguire"") but hes also produced absolute mush (""Elizabethtown"" ""We Bought a Zoo"").

"Review Despite baggage Aloha has its charms - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Cameron Crowes Aloha has its charms despite some of its baggage Aloha Movie review by Mark Olsen Mark Olsen reviews Aloha starring Bradley Cooper Emma Stone and Rachel McAdams. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Mark Olsen reviews Aloha starring Bradley Cooper Emma Stone and Rachel McAdams. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Mark OlsenContact Reporter Bradley Cooper plays a spiritually lost man trying to find himself in Cameron Crowes Aloha Its difficult to engage with writer-director Cameron Crowes new film ""Aloha"" without also acknowledging the bummer buzz that has preceded it.The release date was delayed the film was the subject of some inter-office trash-talking in the hacked Sony emails and more recently was attacked for its depiction (or lack thereof) of native Hawaiians and even the cultural sensitivity of its very title. Hoping to bolster his beleaguered romantic dramedy Crowe made the unusual move of personally introducing the films lone screening for critics this week in L.A. Now perceived as struggling and damaged ""Aloha"" deserves better than all that. Even with its off-balance overstuffed storytelling the film maintains a charm and energy that never flags with brisk pacing and generally engaging performances from its deep-bench cast.INDIE FOCUS Sign up for Mark Olsens newsletter about film The word ""Aloha"" is commonly (and somewhat incorrectly) understood as both a greeting and a farewell. The movie itself is often at similar cross-purposes wanting to be screwball and soulful breezy and serious while also trying to build an expanded world of sharp supporting characters around a central story of a spiritually lost man finding himself. Review Despite baggage Aloha has its charms Neal Preston AP Bradley Cooper and Rachel McAdams in ""Aloha."" Bradley Cooper and Rachel McAdams in ""Aloha."" (Neal Preston AP) Bradley Cooper plays Brian Gilcrest a military contractor and international corporate fixer. After a series of failed projects including being wounded in Afghanistan he finds himself being sent back to an Air Force installation in Hawaii where he has served before working now for a megalomaniac industrialist (Bill Murray) to oversee the launch of a private satellite and its secret payload.He is assigned a briskly enthusiastic young pilot Allison Ng (Emma Stone) as his military watchdog/baby-sitter. It also turns out that an old flame Tracy Woodside (Rachel McAdams) is living with her husband and family on the base. As shot by French cinematographer Eric Gautier the film invokes a verdant dampness and lived-in feeling from the Hawaiian setting instead of the more sunny beachy quality of a picturesque travelogue. Read more movie reviews gt;gt;Open link Crowe teenage rock journalist turned filmmaker still has an air of the boy wonder about him even now in his late 50s. Which makes it all the more fascinating that so many of his films have circled the notion of failure from Lloyd Doblers desire not to buy sell or process in ""Say Anything"" the sad-sack lovers of ""Singles"" the mid-level rock n rollers hitting their ceiling in ""Almost Famous"" to the main characters of ""Jerry Maguire"" ""Elizabethtown"" and ""We Bought a Zoo."" Add Gilcrest to that list. Coopers character has a desperate sense of someone well aware of the edge over which he is about to fall (although the actors on-screen confidence at times undercuts this feeling).Stones character is an amalgam of Renee Zellwegers in ""Jerry Maguire"" and Kirsten Dunsts in ""Elizabethtown."" Stone wears well the angular crispness of her snappy hats and military uniforms and it becomes a keenly self-aware running joke that the pale blond so frequently extols herself as one-quarter Hawaiian.McAdams meanwhile plays likely the strongest most rounded female character Crowe has ever written a woman suddenly face to face with the life she has and the one she might have had and the actress brings a grounded unforced earthiness to the role that is a joy to watch.Also in the top-flight cast are Alec Baldwin as a manic general Murrays tycoon besotted with the possibilities of his own power John Krasinski as McAdams steady quiet husband and Danny McBride as a goofball base administrator.Dennis ""Bumpy"" Kanhele a leader in the Hawaiian independence movement plays himself declaring Hawaii to be under military occupation while wearing a T-shirt that says ""Hawaiian By Birth"" on the front and ""American By Force"" on the back. (Whether that will quell the controversy about the films ethnic mix is open to question.)""Aloha"" likely has a few story strands too many making it feel busy and hectic. It attempts to shoehorn in a spiritual rebirth for Cooper whos involved in a romantic triangle with Stone and McAdams along with plot lines involving kids and the true motives of Murray regarding whats on his about-to-launch satellite.Like ""How Do You Know"" the under-appreciated 2010 film by Crowes early-career mentor James L. Brooks ""Aloha"" looks to walk a difficult tightrope between down-to-Earth reality and the lofty atmosphere familiar to Hollywoods Golden Age comedies. Its a tough balance to strike as the dialogue can sparkle a bit too brightly or the pieces can come to seem a little too preciously set.Yet what both Crowe and Brooks share most is an unending empathy for their characters most especially when they are at their weakest and worst. The dialogue between Cooper and Stone or Cooper and McAdams has real verve and Murray and Stone do a delightful dance to a Hall amp; Oates song (they should have used that scene for the trailer instead of the one that left audiences confused).With its unguarded emotions and romantic earnestness ""Aloha"" seems out of touch with these times its pre-release bad-luck run a sign of some core disconnect. Best to see ""Aloha"" as a messy imperfect movie about messy imperfect people a film of moments and fleeting flashes that may not entirely add up but that are delightful on their own.mark.olsenlatimes.comFollow me on Twitter at IndieFocus and subscribe to my film newsletter------------AlohaRating PG-13 for some language including suggestive commentsRunning time 1 hour and 45 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Reviews Movies Bradley Cooper James L.

(Neal Preston/Sony Pictures Entertainment ... more Photo Neal Preston Associated Press Aloha squeaks by on charm 1 / 6 Back to Gallery ""Aloha"" shows how far a movie can go on charm alone. The latest from writer-director Cameron Crowe is an ungainly collection of likable but awkward scenes. Crowe introduces a serious topic without really examining it and even the romance feels off with a pair of lovers who seem mismatched. To complete the picture Crowe tags on an ending thats convenient but not convincing. And yet in a lumbering knocking-over-the-furniture sort of way ""Aloha"" is an engaging and pleasant experience because there is something about Crowes personality as a filmmaker thats very easy to be around. The movie is warm both smart and silly and it has a good feeling about it -- the feeling that comes of a filmmaker loving his characters. Cynicism is such a reflex in our culture that its a pleasure to inhabit the mental landscape of an artist who isnt cynical at all and who is at least as intelligent as the cynical people. None of this makes ""Aloha"" into one of Crowes better films but it does make this one a little better than the sum of its parts. Bradley Cooper plays a man trying to come back to life after getting wounded in the Middle East. At the start of the movie everybody tells him how bad he looks even though he looks as if he spent three weeks at a spa and tanning facility and had his hair cut five minutes ago. Related Stories What you need to know about this summers movies Brian (Cooper) is returning to Hawaii to work for an eccentric billionaire (Bill Murray) who has partnered with the Defense Department on a project to launch a satellite into space. As chance would have it Hawaii is also the location of Brians lost love (Rachel McAdams) now married with children. And the military has given him an assistant in the form of a captain not the sort of military assistant most people get but one played by Emma Stone. The captain is the movies most unusual character clownishly by-the-book and constantly bragging that she is one-quarter Hawaiian and yet in a way the movies moral center. She is at the intersection of everything -- business the military the native Hawaiians and the romance -- and Stone is game for all that Crowe demands of her. Yet the character is essentially comic so when Crowe starts moving things toward a romance between Brian and the captain its a little hard to get what he sees in her. Its especially difficult with the living memory of Rachel McAdams lurking about threatening to create new history. Brian is a guy with miles on him while Stones captain just seems like a kid. Throughout Crowe has his characters do things that are slightly off. For example on three occasions people talk out loud about someone in the next room without any worry about being overheard. This seems like a small thing and it is but it can throw an audience off because we end up worrying why theyre talking so loud and why theyre not worried about it. Crowe has scenes he wants to write and so he writes them -- and well enough that we end up content with what we get whether they make sense or not. Here as elsewhere he has a feeling for the movie set-piece the scene that can be excerpted to stand on its own. In ""Almost Famous"" it was the ""Tiny Dancer"" scene with everyone singing on the bus. Theres nothing here to compare with the magic of that moment but the scene of Murray and Stone dancing to Hall and Oates ""I Cant Go for That"" can be enjoyed all by itself. Somewhere in here Crowe tries to make a movie about the privatization of outer space the sacredness of the sky the danger of the military industrial complex and the power of love. He does all those things but slightly. The treatment is earnest but glancing and a key scene in which Crowe implies that the collective force of rock n roll can dismantle a nuclear weapon is either ridiculous or a metaphor or both. This could end up being the worst movie youll like all year. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic. E-mail mlasallesfchronicle.com. Twitter MickLaSalle Aloha Comedy-drama.

"Aloha | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; aloha ) Aloha (United States 2015) May 28 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli During the first two decades of his movie career Cameron Crowe was a critical and popular darling turning out titles like Fast Times at Ridgemont High (which he wrote) Say Anything (wrote/directed) Jerry Maguire (wrote/directed) and Almost Famous (wrote/directed). Crowes fall from grace came in 2001 when Vanilla Sky was met with a tepid response by the critics and was ignored at the box office. 2005s Elizabethtown was the filmmakers first across-the-board failure. Following a six-year hiatus he returned in the 2011 holiday season with We Bought a Zoo - although an improvement it was not a ""return to form."" Now four years later he says Aloha. Scarred as a result of (negative) leaked material from the Sony hacking scandal the film was in trouble before its release. Watching it its not hard to understand the studio heads concerns. Aloha is Crowes worst film-to-date eclipsing Elizabethtown for that distinction and raising questions about whether the director has lost his touch (a la Rob Reiner). Its hard to find a level on which Aloha works. Its a murky muddled mess. There are some good individual scenes - mostly featuring the kind of interpersonal interaction that has become Crowes hallmark - but these exist in isolation. The narrative is clunky and disjointed with interminable stretches that dont coalesce. The acting by lead Bradley Cooper is uneven and lacking in charisma and its hard to figure out whether some of the other performers - Alec Baldwin and John Krasinski in particular - are playing for laughs or attempting to develop serious characters. For a while its a mystery where the meandering movie is headed. Brian Gilcrest (Cooper) has returned to his old stomping grounds of Hawaii to do a job for his former boss multi-billionaire Carson Welch (Bill Murray). Brian has a history with Carson - he did shady jobs for the corporate magnate in Afghanistan where he suffered a debilitating injury. He sees this as an opportunity to get back into the game. It also means re-connecting with an old flame Tracy (Rachel McAdams) and having a chance to ignite something with his combustible aide Allison (Emma Stone). For about half the movie Crowe obfuscates Brians purpose in Hawaii - it seems to be to run a ceremony but that apparently is a cover for his real job. Unfortunately when the truth is revealed its nonsensical. The filmmaker may be a cynic when it comes to the military-industrial complex but he has little understanding of how things actually work. Maybe the big climax is intended to be allegorical. Maybe Crowe is trying to make a point. Whatever the case its a big mess and not especially satisfying for a grounded viewer. The last scene raises some confusing questions that come out of nowhere. Crowes films often undergo post-production surgery.  Almost Famous for example lost 40 minutes between the directors cut and the theatrical release. The film is so disjointed that one can guess too much was trimmed. But even if the production flowed better it cant excuse the abysmal conclusion. Any involvement the audience may feel when it comes to the romantic triangle fizzles when Crowe shifts his focus to the Bill Murray or Alec Baldwin characters.  And theres an interminable scene when Brian and Allison negotiate a deal with a native Hawaiian ""king"" that sets up (poorly) something that happens later. There are a few small pleasures. Some scenes between Brian and Allison have a zing to them. The repartee is sharp and theres no shortage of chemistry. Emma Stones performance provides a caffeinated live wire overflowing with infectious enthusiasm. Theres a sense of pathos in the interaction between Brian and Tracy. They know they represented the ""great love"" of each others lives but they messed it up. Theres never an indication they might get back together; they just spend time wallowing in what might have been. The underlying reason for disappointment is that the premise - not dissimilar to the one of Forgetting Sarah Marshall - would seem to be in Crowes wheelhouse.  His oeuvre has shown him to be a romantic and this is the kind of material that handled properly could make for an old-fashioned rom-com. Plus he has three of the hottest actors in Hollywood (including two recent Oscar nominees)... and the result is still a mess. Even his penchant for having pop music help with telling the story fails him - Tears for Fears seems more obligatory than organic. The word ""Aloha"" has come to mean ""hello"" or ""goodbye"" in English. Lets hope the latter doesnt apply to Crowes career as a film director.

Nathan Rabin Special to The Globe and Mail Published Thursday May 28 2015 400PM EDT Last updated Friday May 29 2015 1113AM EDT Comments AA Directed by Cameron Crowe Written by Cameron Crowe Starring Bradley Cooper Emma Stone and Rachel McAdams Classification PG Genre romance Country USA Language English Conventional wisdom holds that it is difficult if not impossible to make a good movie in Hawaii. Filming in a tropical paradise tends to make filmmakers soft and scattered more focused on how to spend their free time than the work at hand. So it is wise to be skeptical of a movie made in Hawaii and about Hawaii and swooningly in love with Hawaii - and cursed with the most generic imaginable title for a Hawaii-themed movie - from Cameron Crowe a filmmaker inclined to gooey softness even when hes not filming in one of the most enchanting places on Earth. The fourth film in the Mad Max franchise starring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron lands in theatres on May 15. Movie Preview Summer movie preview From Fantastic Four to Poltergeist 19 flicks coming your way Video Video Watch Emma Stones remarkable Elephant Man impression Tonally and thematically Aloha feels like a willfully perverse return to Crowes 2005 Elizabethtown the directors biggest flop but clearly a film he loves so much he inexplicably felt the need to make it twice once in the American South and once even further south in Honolulu. Both films centre on men whose extraordinary early promise has curdled into disillusionment leaving them broken and distraught before they return to a homey little paradise complete with fantasy love interest.In Elizabethtown the prodigy made bad was a disgraced superstar shoe designer played by Orlando Bloom. Here its the depressed Brian Gilcrest (Bradley Cooper reverting to the blandly handsome blankness of his pre-Silver Linings Playbook career) a space-obsessed genius who has accepted a mercenary post working for oily billionaire defence contractor Carson Welch (Bill Murray) following a series of personal and professional mistakes that have left him a broken husk of a man.But just as fate provides Blooms sad sack an antidote to his soul-sickness in the form of a flight attendant played by Kirsten Dunst who will not rest until hes bursting with joy in Aloha Brians gloom meets an even more powerful force for happiness in the form of Captain Allison Ng (Emma Stone) his defence department-appointed guide.Allison is supposed to be adorably irritating. Instead she comes off as irritatingly adorable despite the extraordinary charm and magnetism of Stone. Dunsts performance in Elizabethtown inspired me to coin the phrase ""Manic Pixie Dream Girl"" to describe the strangely ubiquitous archetype of the bubbly life-lover who exists in movies like this to instill life lessons and engender a rapturous appreciation of the worlds wonders to gloomy male depressives. Considering the criticism he received for Dunsts performance in Elizabethtown its bewildering that Crowe apparently instructed Stone to give an identical turn in a suspiciously similar role.Crowe has a small-time politicians fawning deference to the innate kindness and decency of common people and an aging hippies distrust of the man. As in Elizabethtown the protagonist is partially healed by the unwavering enthusiasm and support of an impossibly cheerful upbeat figure of romantic fantasy and partially by interacting with the salt-of-the-earth natives of a charmed Southern utopia.Alohas politics are bumper-sticker simplistic and reductive. It is the cinematic equivalent of a ""War is harmful for children and other living things"" sticker slapped on a Volkswagen van particularly in a third act that turns on missiles being the enemy of outer space which is all beautiful and pure and sacred man.At his best Crowes kindness toward his characters and unapologetic embrace of sincerity is a formidable strength in his great early movies like Almost Famous Say Anything and Jerry Maguire but at this point his kindness is a weakness and his fondness for his characters has devolved into sloppy sentimentality. Aloha is a marshmallow of a film soft on the inside soft on the outside and wholly devoid of substance.For a film overflowing with grand proclamations of love and wonder Alohas best moments are devoid of dialogue. As in the similarly maudlin St. Vincent Murray is strongest during the rare instances where hes able to break free of a leaden screenplay and simply exult in the glory of being Bill Murray most notably in a scene where he dances defiantly and exuberantly with Stone. Like Murray the actress is better served by scenes where she doesnt have to talk than by the reams of self-conscious banter Crowe forces upon her.In one of the films many bizarre miscalculations the wry and wisecracking John Krasinski is miscast as John (Woody) Woodside the strong silent husband of Brians ex-girlfriend Tracy (the delightful Rachel McAdams underserved in a role and subplot begging for the cutting room floor).The single joke of Woodys character and a joke the film returns to over and over again to its cutesy detriment (perhaps because it has so few others) is that he communicates a lot without actually speaking. Within the context of the film this causes problems in his marriage with Tracy. But given the nature of Crowes desperately overwritten screenplay a reluctance to fill the world with bubbly unnecessary and stridently clever verbiage is less a flaw than a strength every character in the film should share.

"Aloha (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Aloha (PG-13) Cameron Crowes lumpy unwieldy comedy is filled with moments of emotional splendor. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com5/28/2015 Editor rating 2.5 Aloha is the strangest movie to date by writer-director Cameron Crowe -- yes even stranger than Vanilla Sky -- and in some ways it is also his worst.  Crowes films have always been inviting and easy to slip into. Their themes -- unrequited crushes the all-consuming love of music the desire to achieve ones maximum potential the perennial ritual of returning to ones hometown -- are relatable and easy to grasp. The pleasures of Say Anything or Almost Famous or Jerry Maguire start with their opening shots and the reason those pictures stay with you is a testament to the humaneness with which Crowe views people. Even the films in which he wasnt always successful such as the flawed but underrated Elizabethtown or the too-on-the-nose We Bought a Zoo were never discombobulating. Not everyone may have enjoyed them but I cant imagine anyone being baffled by them. Aloha is different because Crowe waits awhile this time before letting you find your bearings. Some will think he waits too long. At first the story of a former military man turned defense contractor named Brian (Bradley Cooper) who falls for an Air Force captain Allison (Emma Stone) during a trip to Hawaii to oversee the launch of a satellite is befuddling. Who are these people and why are we following them? Is Brian flirting with Allison or vice versa? Why is their back-and-forth banter so charmless and stilted? Who exactly is the powerful businessman played by Bill Murray? And when Brian goes to have dinner at the home of his former flame Tracy (Rachel McAdams) who is now married to a taciturn pilot (John Krasinski) and is the mother of two what are we to make of their current relationship? Do they still have feelings for each other? What the hell is going on in this movie? Those wobbly first 15 minutes could be the result of studio tampering. Or they could be a sign of Crowe struggling -- and failing -- to launch Aloha in a way that immediately draws us in with curiosity instead of familiarity. Or he could just be doing it on purpose. Whatever the reason it doesnt work. The movie is initially off-putting confusing even -- yes -- boring. Compare this to the audacious opening of Elizabethtown (a movie a lot of people despised but not for its hilarious prologue) and you wonder if Alohas troubled production history wound up affecting the finished film after all. Here you ponder may be Crowes first all-out dud. And then slowly the picture starts to come together even though it remains an oddly disparate contraption. The central premise is too big for the protagonists - the stuff dealing with the rocket launch could have come from a James Bond picture complete with a greedy megalomaniacal villain - but the bulk of the picture focuses on all the right things. Aloha opens with the old Columbia Pictures logo instead of the sleeker contemporary one -- a sign perhaps that the filmmaker is letting the audience know were in for an off-kilter love story that doesnt follow the modern-day template such as The Apartment or LAtalante or even I Know Where Im Going Im not trying to imply Aloha is anywhere in their league To quote The Breakfast Club ""Not even close bud."" But you can see what Crowe was going for and there are moments of such emotional honesty such as a conversation between two people tempted to follow one path but agreeing reluctantly it would be a mistake that prove he can still turn cliched situations into moments of clear-eyed insight into the infuriating heartbreaking vagaries of love. Aloha which also has to do with weapons of war and the overcrowding of Earths orbit and a perpetually angry general (Alec Baldwin) is an overstuffed bird. But its hard to say what should have been cut. Crowe needs that long sequence in which Brian and Allison visit the home of one of the local civic leaders known as ""The Chief"" who tells them to keep their eyes open to the miracles that are constantly happening around us but are easy to overlook. Based on the films awful confusing trailers (you can tell distributor Sony Pictures had no idea how to market this movie) Aloha has come under attack by some groups for ""white-washing"" Hawaiian culture and misappropriating ""aloha"" for a cutesy title ignoring the deeper meanings of the word. But when you see the film you realize Crowe has done none of those things and not just because the blond blue-eyed Allison happens to be part Hawaiian and part Chinese (as well as Scandinavian). Crowe treats Hawaiian culture and customs with the same affection and respect he showed for Southern hospitality in Elizabethtown. Hes just not afraid to poke fun at it too the way he pokes fun at everyone in the movie at some point (the running gag about Krasinskis inability to verbalize his feelings or pretty much anything for that matter pays off in a hilarious yet weirdly touching gag). Yes Aloha is a mess. But messes can be fascinating and theres a lot of tenderness and beauty and heartbreak here too. Crowe draws strong performances from his three leads Cooper keeps getting better and more commanding with every film Stones astonishing eyes have never been more expressive and McAdams radiates a motherly warmth and wisdom that I had never seen her attempt before. Her character knows that sometimes it really is too late for some things to happen no matter how perfect they once seemed. Much will be written about Alohas failure at the box office - this one is destined to bomb like a megaton nuclear rocket - and by August the film will be largely forgotten. This is the kind of movie that is easier to mock than to grapple with on its own terms. But if you connect with Aloha youll be revisiting it often. Its an imperfect picture littered with flaws but sometimes those movies can be the most interesting ones. The doors to the Aloha cult fan club are officially open. Ill take one ticket please. Cast Bradley Cooper Emma Stone Rachel McAdams Bill Murray John Krasinski Danny McBride Alec Baldwin. Writer-director Cameron Crowe. A Columbia Pictures release. Running time 105 minutes.

Welcome to Hawaii. Bradley Cooper smiles his way through the shenanigans as the wounded hero (physically morally spiritually professionally) who has to choose which parts are worth healing and which can be cut away. Happily he gets help from a wide-eyed angel in uniform (Emma Stone) from his sweet-natured ex (Rachel McAdams) and her kids from the sovereign King of Hawaii and from the islands mythical-magical persons and powers. The nefarious machinations that surround our man are rather more convincing (and intelligible) than the personal dramatics as if to indicate that director Cameron Crowe doesnt want us to take any of this too seriously. Or at least not to let the bitter get in the way of the sweet. Its a pity with a little more craft this could have been a tropical noir with a heart.

Director Cameron Crowe (145). PG-13 Sexuality. Area theaters. HOW DO you cast Bradley Cooper Emma Stone and Rachel McAdams in a romantic comedy and just wind up with ""meh""? Thats the first but not the only head-scratchingly odd thing about ""Aloha"" the bland new film from writer-director Cameron Crowe (""Say Anything"" ""Jerry Maguire"" ""Almost Famous""). A few others are Was ""Vanilla Sky"" such a bomb that it derailed Crowe for some 15 years? Did Crowe tell his actors to simply talk really fast so that it would appear as witty banter? Did he really cast the great Bill Murray in a cameo -- then not write a part that requires him to do anything? Cooper plays Brian a former pilot turned military contractor who now works for Carson Welch (Murray) a telecommunications billionaire. Brian has a short-term gig in Hawaii preparing the launch of one of Welchs satellites. There Brian runs into his ex-love Tracy (McAdams) who introduces him to her kids and husband the strong but silent Woody (John Krasinski). Brian is also assigned a military liaison Allison Ng (Stone) a by-the-book fellow fighter pilot with a snappy salute who calls drinks ""beverages."" During his stay Brian a veteran of Afghanistan is encouraged by Allison to embrace the mystery of the islands. Hes rebuffed by Tracy who hasnt seen him in 13 years and yelled at by a blustery general (funny Alec Baldwin). But he does have a bonding moment with King of the Sovereign Kingdom of Hawaii Dennis (Bumpy) Kanahele the real-life Hawaiian king and eventually sees through Welchs nefarious goals. And there are some Crowe-specific family scenes complete with hula lessons and of course a precocious 10-year-old with a video cameras. ""Aloha"" isnt horrible but it does have a pitiable odor about it like a dog thats sat too long on the beach. Crowe aspires to Golden Age of Hollywood repartee but something feels off just as it did in ""Elizabethtown"" (2005) and ""We Bought a Zoo"" (2011). Everyone just seems to be trying too hard. Cooper is jittery and seems unmoored in the story. Stone is off-putting -- the first (and hopefully last) time this charmer has been called that -- and McAdams way overdue for a hit deserves scenes with some meat to them. Krasinski is fine; he and Cooper share a goofy scene in which their glances and shoulder-punches come with ""dude-its-all-OK"" subtitles to tell us what they mean. Maybe ""Aloha"" needed subtitles throughout so wed know what Crowe was aiming for -- because this meandering cinematic vacation aims for a romantic heart but leaves only a mouthful of poi. jneumaiernydailynews.com Catch ""Joe Neumaiers Movie Minute"" throughout the day Thurs. - Sun. on New Yorks WOR 710 AM and at wor710.com.

Photo Neal Preston MOVIE REVIEW Aloha Running time 105 minutes. Rated PG-13 (language). In the middle of Cameron Crowes ""Aloha"" a character is revealed to have had an extra big toe accidentally stitched onto his own after a combat accident. This illogical surgical snafu is emblematic of the film itself a jumble of too many plots involving characters who almost never talk or act like real people. There are grand romantic speeches that will endure forever from Crowes earlier work -- ""Jerry Maguire"" ""Say Anything . . ."" -- but you cant build an entire movie on them. Nobody wants two hours of ""You had me at hello."" Bradley Coopers Brian Gilcrest a military man-turned-private contractor is an identifiable relation of Maguires ""A brilliant compelling innovative commanding wreck of a guy."" Back in his home state of Hawaii to service the expanding telecommunications footprint of his eccentric billionaire boss Carson Welch (Bill Murray expertly playing Bill Murray) Gilcrest is assigned an Air Force escort for reasons Im still trying to work out in the form of Emma Stones Capt. Allison Ng. Bradley Cooper and Emma StonePhoto Neal Preston Stone wears her ""Top Gun"" flight suit and Ray-Bans like a champ but shes supposed to read as too-eager and dorky -- and it just doesnt fly (so to speak). ""Can you think of a way to make Im a fighter pilot sound sexy?"" she responds when asked why shes single. Um yes Literally any way you say it especially when you look like Stone. But Gilcrest is momentarily blinded to Ngs charms by his ex Tracy (Rachel McAdams) now married to another pilot Woody (John Krasinski surprisingly hulking). They have a daughter (Danielle Rose Russell) and a precocious son (Jaeden Lieberher) obsessed with Hawaiian mythology in a plot quirk that never really pays off. Brian has lingering feelings and Tracys marriage is in trouble because Woody never talks -- perhaps the worst thing you can say of someone in a Crowe movie where nervous rambling doubles as foreplay. Bradley Cooper and Rachel McAdamsPhoto Neal Preston Meanwhile the increasingly dubious work mission involves convincing a native Hawaiian community to allow use of land and air space for a satellite launch. With the help of the ""quarter Hawaiian"" Ng Gilcrest promises they absolutely wont ever use the deal to put weapons in space. (Guess what happens next?) The film alternates between shoving its confusing plot forward and dropping dialogue bombs that fizzle ""Youve sold your soul so many times nobodys buying anymore."" ""Take those blue eyes and go to her."" And my favorite ""I got personal with you. I never get personal"" -- the latter delivered by someone whos nothing but personal from the start. Bradley Cooper and Alec BaldwinPhoto Neal Preston There are a handful of moments to relish Murray and Stone memorably take to the dance floor for Hall amp; Oates ""I Cant Go For That."" Alec Baldwin bellows insults as a perennially irritated general. Krasinski and Cooper have an eye-contact-only ""conversation"" which Crowe amusingly subtitles. But given its Hawaiian setting and soundtrack ""Aloha"" mostly feels like a descendant of Alexander Paynes ""The Descendants"" -- and a minor one at that.

Article Tweet Change text size for the story Print this story Report an error Aloha 3.5 stars Starring Bradley Cooper Emma Stone Rachel McAdams Bill Murray John Krasinski Danny McBride Alec Baldwin Directed by Cameron Crowe Written by Cameron Crowe Duration 105 minutes Related Stories Bradley Cooper Helen Mirren earn Tony nominations Bradley Cooper set for Broadway revival of The Elephant Man Cameron Crowes musical moments From Say Anything... to Aloha Aloha sinks under wave of harsh reviews with 10 million Cameron Crowe on casting Emma Stone I offer you a heart-felt apology At times you wont know if youre coming or going at Cameron Crowes new movie. Maybe thats why its called Aloha. Sometimes confusing and often self-indulgent Aloha is also kind of fabulous to watch. Thats mostly thanks to a great cast. Bradley Cooper stars as Brian Gilcrest a former military man turned contractor whos just been handed a second chance in life. After doing the wrong thing (and getting wounded) on an assignment in the Middle East Gilcrest dropped out of his own life. Now some 13 years later hes returning to Hawaii and the people and places he left behind. Hes once again associating with the uberwealthy entrepreneur Carson Welch (Billy Murray); Welch and the U.S. army are working on a joint space project. Gilcrest has only a small assignment which is to use his influence and friendship with a Native Hawaiian leader (Dennis Bumpy Kanahele) to get a blessing done and an obstacle to the space project removed. Mobile users please view trailer here. Given Gilcrests past as a loose cannon the military assigns him a watchdog in Hawaii to ensure he doesnt mess up. Captain Ng (Emma Stone) is keen and nerdy a fighter pilot obsessed with space and the stars. Shes annoyingly spunky as she follows Gilcrest around. Also in Hawaii is Gilcrests old girlfriend Tracy (Rachel McAdams) now married with two kids. Gilcrest and Tracy have a lot of unfinished business. Tracys husband Woody (John Krasinski) is an old buddy of Gilcrests -- but not too happy to see him back in Hawaii. Here well draw you a map Theres the love triangle of Bradley Cooper/Emma Stone/ Rachel McAdams -- who will he choose? And then theres the love triangle of Bradley Cooper/ Rachel McAdams/ John Krasinski -- who will she choose? Its busy. Around the edges of all this resolution of love affairs old and new is where Aloha shines. The movie has wonderful madness built into it -- a dancing scene with Bill Murray and Emma Stone for example or a manic confrontation with a high-ranking General (Alec Baldwin). It includes magical children (and wonderful performances from Danielle Rose Russell and Jaeden Lieberher as those children) and the story incorporates elements of the Hawaiian spiritual world and the way of Aloha. It will also make you laugh. Aloha is plot-heavy and uneven and some space launch material near the end is just weird. However the movie is also clever and engaging when it counts with exchanges that sound improvised and a general air of spontaneity. You wont be bored. Crowe keeps the camera right in his characters faces which adds to the intimacy of the tale; above all he seems to have lured Bill Murray away from that precious place known as Wes Andersonville.

Really talented directors sometimes step into the batters box take a gigantic swing and whiff. The only mystery is why it doesnt happen more often. All of which is to say that  you are about to read a lot of scathing reviews of Cameron Crowes latest film Aloha in the next couple of days that may or may not employ a lot of ""Bad Lei"" puns. But the unfortunate inescapable truth is the movie really is that terrible. Its especially surprising considering the source. After all Crowe is responsible for some of the most indelible rom-com highlights of the past 30 years. He put the boombox into John Cusacks outstretched arms in Say Anything... he penned Renee Zellwegers ""You had me at hello"" line for Jerry Maguire and he transformed Kate Hudson into the romantic gypsy dreamer Penny Lane in Almost Famous. Aloha wants to be all of those films transposed to the jasmine-scented paradise of Hawaii but it just feels like Elizabethtown on downers. I didnt believe a second of it. Bradley Cooper stars as Brian Gilcrest a former Air Force hotshot whos sold his soul to work for a billionaire private-sector contractor played by Bill Murray. Despite his ladykiller blue eyes and irresistible charisma hes a fallen idealist in the midst of a midlife funk. His latest assignment for his amoral boss is to head to Hawaii grease a few palms and sweet-talk a reluctant tribal elder (real-life native leader Dennis ""Bumpy"" Kanahele) into giving his blessing to a construction project built on sacred ground. At least thats his cover story. His real objective it turns out may be significantly more cavalier and shady. Complicating Gilcrests visit are two women who in their own ways challenge his compartmentalized emotional numbness. The first is his old girlfriend (Rachel McAdams) whom he walked out on 13 years earlier in a fit of commitmentphobia and is now married and has two kids. The second is a military escort (Emma Stone) whose clipped diction whipcrack salute and starched by-the-book uptightness pretty much telegraph that she will learn to ease up in the reflection of his baby blues and find a way to teach Coopers wounded lone wolf to love again. It would be hard to find a love triangle built on wobblier legs. None of the three leads are bad per se. But its hard to make chicken salad out of lines like ""I need you to believe in me"" and ""You sold your soul so many times nobodys buying anymore."" I realize that dialogue like that isnt a far way off from Jerry Maguires ""You complete me."" But at least in that movie it felt organic as corny as it may have been. Here it just feels like Crowe is pulling out his scratchy old Greatest Hits album. Making it all worse is how ineffectively Crowe uses his Hawaiian setting. Its obvious that while working on Alohas script Crowe fell in love with the islands and their people and customs. But he doesnt do them - or his audience - any favors by larding the story with mystical Hawaiian mythology and sledgehammer-subtle symbolism. In the film doors and windows blow open at pivotal moments to show us that spirits are at work. When the local elder is ultimately betrayed he stands out in the rain looking at the heavens as if to imply that the Gods are crying. Its pure Boomer sap. Ultimately Crowes exotic love story boils down to this question Can Stone teach Cooper to love again and save his soul before its too late? Go ahead take a wild guess. Better yet dont. She can and she does. I just saved you ten bucks. Its said that in Hawaii the word ""Aloha"" is a greeting that translates to both ""Hello"" and ""Goodbye."" In this case Aloha also means ""Stay Away.""

Neal Preston/Columbia Pictures hide caption toggle caption Neal Preston/Columbia Pictures Bradley Cooper and Emma Stone in Aloha. Neal Preston/Columbia Pictures Its hard to tell what exactly Bradley Coopers deal is in the imperfect yet oddly compelling tropical dramedy Aloha. His character Brian Gilcrest is a military contractor assigned to oversee a ceremony in Hawaii that will allow his employer to launch a new satellite of dubious motives. That parts easy enough. After his role in the megahit American Sniper its intriguing to see Cooper playing what amounts to a cynical bizarro-world version of Chris Kyle. But Brian also has a long and troubled personal history which seems to have a parallel in the films long and troubled production. Hes ping-ponged between military and civilian life; between ground air and space (he has worked with NASA); between professional success and disgrace (he did something unsavory in Kabul some time ago); between Hawaii and elsewhere; and between lovers naturally. Much of this unfolds in one of those upbeat hard-rock montages so beloved by Alohas writer-director Cameron Crowe. But while tracking say sports agent Jerry Maguires rise and fall from grace in 1996 felt brisk and exciting getting an info-dump on Brian just weighs us down when we should be enjoying the scenery. The confusing backstory -- perhaps a telltale sign that Crowe has been tinkering with Alohas script since 2008 when the film was originally scheduled to shoot with a different cast -- means it takes us some time to realize just how significant it is for Brian to return to Hawaii. It gives him a chance to reconnect with his ex-girlfriend Tracy (Rachel McAdams) and see the family she has built with the also-ran in her life the practically mute Air Force pilot Woody (John Krasinski doing great things with extended silences). Theres lots of regret in the air but Brian has a new pretty face to keep his mind off the one that got away fighter pilot Capt. Allison Ng (Emma Stone) who has been assigned to his charge during his stay. Ng allows her love for the island and for her job to spill over into love for Brian. Shes also one-quarter Hawaiian a fact she repeats often. For many viewers any enjoyment of Aloha whose title has been criticized by native Hawaiians will hinge on how many times they can hear Emma Stone insist shes part-Hawaiian without exploding. Aloha feels like a more straightforward romantic comedy than Crowe typically makes but its best moments are when it breaks away from the love triangle to attempt a more complex story about land country and myth. Theres drama surrounding the love-hate relationship between the military and private contractors as personified by small roles for all-star bit players Alec Baldwin (as a general) and Bill Murray (as the tech megalomaniac who employs Brian). The film also touches on simmering resentment from native Hawaiians over American colonization of their island Brian needs an endorsement from real-life Hawaiian nationalist Dennis ""Bumpy"" Kanahele (playing himself) so the contractors can build a rocket launch base over ancient bones. As he has often shown in his films Crowe knows his way around a chaotic set piece. Two sprawling scenes one at an airport tarmac and one at an all-night party show every major player interlocking without ever losing momentum. Later a bizarre climax involving a satellite and a pop-culture sound collage should be admired for its willingness to go for broke even if it makes zero sense. But the rest of the film feels too gooey too rote -- an awful lot of Cooper and Stone (who as charming as she is seems miscast) making flirty faces at each other while McAdams looks on wistfully. A running discussion about Hawaiian legend and ownership of the sky never quite jells with the decidedly non-mythic romance at the films center. Crowe has reached an unenviable position as a filmmaker. He made three excellent movies in the 20th century and then had the audacity to keep working into the 21st. Modern audiences and critics may associate Crowe less with his era-defining works Say Anything Jerry Maguire and Almost Famous and more with the corn flakes of Elizabethtown and We Bought A Zoo. But even through his Sappy Period which more or less continues with Aloha Crowe displays a willingness to reach for ambitious ideas and bighearted emotionally naked moments that other name-brand filmmakers are too terrified to explore. Aloha is a big mess but its also at war with American cynicism and wars get messy.

Photo Credit AP / Neal Preston advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A military veteran finds himself caught between an old flame and a new love. Rated PG-13. BOTTOM LINE The weeks real disaster film is this botched romance from Cameron Crowe. Mushy misguided and borderline bizarre. CAST Bradley Cooper Emma Stone Rachel McAdams LENGTH 145 Imagine a candlelit dinner prepared by a top chef and served on the sands of a sparkling beach. Now imagine that the dinner has been boiling on the stove for something like two years and youve got ""Aloha"" a botched romance from Cameron Crowe (""Jerry Maguire"") starring Bradley Cooper and Emma Stone. Whatever ""Aloha"" started out to be its been overcooked into an unidentifiable inedible mush. Somewhere between the films first days of shooting in 2013 its scuppered Christmas release last year and its arrival in theaters this weekend something went terribly wrong. The films title which wasnt officially announced until February is as good -- or as bad -- as any given that the film has no idea what its about. It has something to do with opening oneself to love while atoning for the past. Or maybe ""Aloha"" is about the exploitation of native peoples by a corrupt military. Or is it about family? All right ""Aloha"" it is. advertisement | advertise on newsday Cooper plays Brian Gilcrest a military vet who returns to Hawaii to find that his old flame Tracy (Rachel McAdams) has started a family with his colleague Woody (John Krasinski). Gilcrest is now working for billionaire Carson Welch who is either a lovable do-gooder or a despicable warmonger; no spoilers but Bill Murray plays him one way while the script says another. Meanwhile Gilcrest is intrigued by young Air Force Captain Allison Ng played by Stone as an uptight careerist with a mystical nature if that makes any sense. Crowe whose ""Jerry Maguire"" gave us such immortal lines as ""You complete me"" is on sincerity overdrive here but his characters are such weird contrivances that the dialogue turns sour in the actors mouths. ""Would you stop getting more beautiful?"" is not a quote for the ages its an atrocious pickup line -- and because its delivered in the films opening 10 minutes it wrecks the romantic tension we were hoping for. ""Aloha"" is one of those films whose characters behave and speak so irrationally that they no longer make any human sense at all. Crowe may have had us at hello but hes losing us with ""Aloha.""

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Cameron Crowe tells love stories. Its about all he does really. Most of the writer-directors movies from the teen classic Say Anything to his Grunge-era date flick Singles to the quotably potent Jerry Maguire pivot around literal romances. When the focus isnt on boys meeting girls its still affection--for people for places for things especially for music--that drives his work. Thats why even a bad Cameron Crowe movie can earn a smile or two. Theres just something infectious in a proudly uncool kind of way about the sincerity of the mans convictions. He broadcasts his big sloppy feelings like a teenage boy lifting a boombox over his head.Aloha the filmmakers latest blast of uncut earnestness is closer to a bad Cameron Crowe movie than a good one. Set against the scenic splendor of Hawaii and under a starry sky everyone keeps lovingly gazing into the film never quite makes the case that its hero a fallen dreamer played by Bradley Cooper is worth falling for. Thats a big problem in a drama built on romantic rapport and as a portrait of a broken man redeemed by the love of a good woman Aloha often stumbles. Yet theres enough passion here--for the culture of Hawaii for the history of NASA--to prevent a fiasco of Elizabethtown proportions.Not that the film doesnt court comparisons to that self-indulgent career lowlight. Cooper like Orlando Bloom before him has been cast as a down-on-his-luck pretty boy returning to a significant place from his past where a spunky love interest helps ease him out of his funk. Following an injury in Afghanistan defense contractor Brian Gilcrest (Cooper) heads for Hawaii to oversee a private satellite launch the brainchild of eccentric billionaire Carson Welch (Bill Murray). Brian has to earn the blessing of a nationalist leader (Dennis ""Bumpy"" Kanahele playing himself) but his problems are as much personal as professional. After all hes drifted back into the orbit of the one that got away Tracy Woodside (Rachel McAdams) who broke off their engagement about a dozen years prior and is now married with two kids. While sorting through that ancient baggage Brian also struggles to resist the charms of Allison Ng (Emma Stone) a boundlessly enthusiastic Air Force pilot charged with shadowing him during his stay on the island chain.Thankfully Aloha doesnt devolve into a cut-and-dry love triangle Crowe is smart enough not to pit his two female leads against each other opting instead to keep the will-they/wont-they tension between Cooper and Stone. The stars settle nicely into their roles--he turning up the wounded-nice-guy smolder she radiating a lust for life--and theres a certain old-fashioned even screwball charm to the courtship. But Crowe cuts corners in establishing their chemistry Instantly and inexplicably smitten with her charge Allison emerges from the same fantasy factory that produced the Kirsten Dunst character in Elizabethtown for whom this very site coined the Manic Pixie Dream Girl title. Likewise Brian and Tracy rarely interact like people who havent seen each other for 13 years; shes especially quick to overshare about her marriage to Woody (John Krasinski) a taciturn military man whose failure to communicate is played for both drama and cornball comedy. (At first Krasinski seems an odd choice for the strong and silent type until one remembers the wordless wonders he performed on The Office.)Perhaps the energy Crowe could have expended on shaping believable characters went instead to the cultural context. Set in the last days of December the plot itself is something of a Christmas tree with individual obsessions hung like ornaments on its branches. Fears that the film may have whitewashed its tropical backdrop were premature as Aloha gushes over everything from the natural wonders to the folklore to the art of Hawaii. This being a Cameron Crowe movie music is naturally also a through-line The filmmaker carefully curates his soundtrack--an original score by Sigur Ros frontman Jonsi alternates with native slack-key folk standards and Elvis tunes--while defining his characters through their musical hangups. Crowe even finds room for a totally superfluous scene of Bill Murray and Emma Stone dancing to Hall amp; Oates because why wouldnt he?Speaking of Murray not even that deadpan comic genius can salvage the movies chief subplot in which Coopers disillusioned stargazer having sold his expertise (and soul?) to the private sector wrestles with the ethics of ""buying the sky."" Crowe has always had an odd sometimes refreshing habit of affording his characters unconventional occupations and Aloha takes the Jerry Maguire route of tying Brians personal redemption to his professional choices. In this case however that leads to a totally absurd climax--a rocket launch that becomes a grand gesture of romantic sacrifice. Its as dumb as that sounds but also weirdly endearing at least for those who see something of value in the filmmakers heart-over-head creative logic. Only Cameron Crowe perhaps would think to make a satellite look like a boombox pulsating with sound and feeling.

EntertainmentMovies Aloha Cameron Crowe creates a quotably bad movie in paradise Originally published May 28 2015 at 101 pm Updated May 28 2015 at 1251 pm Bradley Cooper left and Rachel McAdams are among the stars in ""Aloha."" (Neal Preston) A review of ""Aloha"" starring Bradley Cooper Bill Murray Rachel McAdams Emma Stone and John Krasinski -- to no avail. Rating 1.5 stars out of 4. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic Whered you go Cameron Crowe? ""Aloha"" the writer/directors latest sort-of romantic comedy limps to the screen with such flat-footedness you wonder how its creator ever achieved such heights as ""Say Anything"" and ""Almost Famous."" Its highlight Im sorry to say is a moment in which an irate Alec Baldwin (maybe he just read the script?) addresses Bradley Cooper as ""Mr. Three-Day Beard Boy."" This is rather delicious to be sure -- I may never look at Cooper and his movie-star fuzz again without hearing Baldwin thundering -- but really is that all there is? Anyway here we have Cooper as Brian Gilcrest a pleasantly stubble-y military contractor who returns to Hawaii on business both the regular and the unfinished kind. The regular business involves Bill Murray as a puckishly unshaven (am I sensing a theme here?) gazillionaire industrialist whos Brians boss; the unfinished business centers on Tracy (Rachel McAdams) the Girl Who Got Away some 13 years ago. Shes now married to a cuddly silent type named Woody (John Krasinski) but her 12-year-old daughter bears an uncanny resemblance were unsubtly informed to Brian. Meanwhile fighter pilot and military captain Allison Ng (Emma Stone) assigned to baby-sit Brian during his mission falls for him which she expresses primarily by calling him ""sir"" a lot. This is a lot of plot and virtually none of it is believable even considering the heft of this cast -- youd think this gang could make anything sing wouldnt you? But Krasinski literally has nothing to say right up to a ridiculous late scene involving subtitles; McAdams relies entirely on adorable smiles lip-biting and eye-twinkling (even when shes supposed to be upset); a mostly absent Murray lights up only when singing ""The Wheels on the Bus"" (which to be fair he nails); and Stone making Captain Ng cartoonishly precise and uptight demonstrates to us that yes shes capable of a bad performance. (Et tu Emma?) And Cooper eyes wide marches through the cuteness making the best of a bad situation. Movie Review 1/2   Aloha with Bradley Cooper Emma Stone Rachel McAdams Bill Murray John Krasinski Danny McBride Alec Baldwin. Written and directed by Cameron Crowe. 100 minutes. Rated PG-13 for some language including suggestive comments. Several theaters. All this plus some dialogue thats occasionally ""50-Shades-of-Grey""-without-the-sex-bad (""I dont want to wind up a decal on your laptop"" says poor Captain Ng earnestly) and the result is a movie thats well-meaning but nearly unwatchable. Stay home and watch a better Crowe movie instead and ponder what went wrong. Most Read StoriesThinking of voting for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson?

Do you remember a 2005 movie called ""Elizabethtown""? Probably not. Named for director Cameron Crowes hometown it was all over the map -- literally. It starred Orlando Bloom as an Oregon shoe designer who costs his company billions attempts suicide learns that his estranged father has died in Kentucky falls in love with flight attendant Kirsten Dunst bonds with long-lost relatives and humors mom Susan Sarandon as she attempts a stand-up comedy career. The final act was a cross-country road trip for no apparent reason except to showcase the directors favorite landmarks.Crowes new movie ""Aloha"" has a similar lack of focus. Blessed with a stellar cast and idyllic locale Crowe seems reluctant to waste anything including his own half-baked themes. Among other things the script is about love war real estate paternity volcano gods atmospheric debris Hawaiian sovereignty the privatization of the military and the power of pop music to defeat a killer satellite.Thats quite a lavish luau yet the individual courses are meager. The way that this much-edited film has been sliced and diced its aggravatingly unclear whats going on but heres our guess Brian Gilcrest (Bradley Cooper) is a wounded veteran of the Afghan war who is now working for satellite mogul Carson Welch (Bill Murray). Brian returns to his former home base on Oahu to organize a ceremonial blessing of a new military facility. In Honolulu he reconnects with long-ago love Tracy (Rachel McAdams) who is now raising two kids with soldier Woody (John Krasinski). Pulling Brian in the opposite direction is his caffeinated chaperone Air Force Capt. Allison Ng (Emma Stone). So it seems like a romantic comedy. But then theres all this other stuff.To secure the ceremonial blessing Brian has to negotiate a land deal with the self-declared king of Hawaii (Dennis ""Bumpy"" Kanahele playing himself). The continuing Hawaiian resistance to American rule is a fascinating subject and worthy of its own movie but here the visit to the militant compound is just a dash of local color as quarter-Hawaiian Allison plays hula music and muses about the clutter in the sacred skies above. One problem here is that Stone is in kooky-character mode while McAdams embodies a bittersweet realism and Cooper swings between the acting styles of his two co-stars. (Meanwhile fourth banana Krasinski is stuck in a role where his reluctance to talk is a dumb running gag.) Music maven Crowe tops this pineapple upside-down cake with a nutty subplot about saving the world with the ultimate mix tape.The setting and offbeat tone may remind some viewers of another recent comedy but whereas ""The Descendants"" was a substantive meal ""Aloha"" is a pu pu platter.What ""Aloha""  Two stars out of four  Run time 140  Rating PG-13  Content Some adult language Joe Williams  314-340-8344Film criticjoethecritic on Twitterjoewilliamspost-dispatch.com Tags Hawaii Joe Williams Bradley Cooper Emma Stone Rachel Mcadams Aloha Cameron Crowe Joe Williams Joe Williams is the film critic for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

Cameron Crowes sporadically cryptic romcom wraps a love triangle in a plot that involves the military-industrial complex and rocket science By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com May 28 2015 315 p.m. ET Ive never seen a movie quite like ""Aloha."" Thats meant neither as praise nor as a backhanded compliment; its offered more in the spirit of one hand clapping. Cameron Crowes romantic comedy set in Hawaii and starring Bradley Cooper Rachel McAdams and Emma Stone means to be cryptic for a while or at least challenging to decode. For longer than a while I found it baffling--who were all these attractive people talking all this frothy talk? Yet I kept watching with interest that ebbed and flowed for reasons eventually clarified by a very funny scene thats essentially silent and fitted with subtitles. The best...

If one thing is clear in the deeply confused Aloha its Cameron Crowes affection for the Hawaiian landscape and native culture. His off-the-tourist-track look at Honolulu abounds with intriguing views of unexpected terrain and offers a glimpse of the indigenous populations independence movement. All of which suggests a far more compelling movie than the muddled redemption story hes made. Taking something of a chance Crowe centers his narrative on a most unlikely hero a defense contractor. Bradley Cooper puts his baby blues and conspicuous likability to work in the role playing a lapsed idealist who gradually reconnects with his higher instincts and island mana or spiritual energy after he returns to Oahu. Spurring the healing process are a former girlfriend (Rachel McAdams) and a new love interest (Emma Stone). Its a triangle built on down-to-earth dazzle. But with the screenplays strained whimsy and pathos not to mention its unpersuasive at times incoherent musings on the politics of space exploration Crowe squanders the star power at hand. As with another major miss by the writer-director 2005s Elizabethtown the new film has the awkward feel of a repository for everything but the kitchen sink. The chemistry is mostly forced the story without an emotional core. And though Crowes facility for language can be striking here it never moves beyond self-consciousness. The cast will entice audiences but Aloha looks destined for a relatively quick hello-and-goodbye in theaters. Deplaning on an airstrip at Hickam Field the Honolulu Air Force base Coopers Brian Gilcrest finds himself literally between two women as the film begins. On one side is his official handler Air Force pilot Allison Ng (Stone) a bright-eyed overeager and overwritten go-getter. On the other side is his ex forensics chief Tracy Woodside (McAdams). Read more Lena Dunham Amy Schumer and Actress A-List in R-Rated Roundtable Though they havent spoken in 13 years and shes the married mother of two tweens Tracy pulls him back into their unresolved romantic business with a jarring urgency venting freely about her uncommunicative husband Woody. A miscast John Krasinski is required to take the running joke of Woodys laconic behavior from contrived to absurd. But his is hardly the only story strand to reach an unsatisfying conclusion. Woody might eye Gilcrest warily and General Dixon (Alec Baldwin in angry-boss mode) might not be a fan but Danny McBrides second-in-command (a thoroughly underdeveloped role) welcomes him warmly. Gilcrest was once a hero at Hickam before he decamped to the mercenary ""gray side"" as he explains in halfheartedly apologetic voiceover. Hes being given another chance by gazillionaire industrialist Carson Welch (an entertainingly eccentric Bill Murray). It emerges in unconvincing bits and pieces including an ill-advised flashback that theyd let each other down and how in Kabul. But now Welch and the military are depending on Gilcrests friendship with a local Hawaiian leader to smooth the way for the entrepreneurs Hickam-based space program. Independence movement leader Dennis ""Bumpy"" Kanahele a descendant of Hawaiis King Kamehameha plays himself in a scene whose documentary aspects -- it was filmed at the sovereignty movements mountain village -- are the backdrop for gently comic negotiations over land use as well as some lovely slack-key guitar playing by Ledward Kaapana. Unfortunately its also occasion for more self-congratulatory overexuberance from Stones Ng who likes to point out that shes a quarter Hawaiian. The philosophical divide between Gilcrest and Ng is as artificial as their intended repartee and an obvious setup for his eventual about-face. For him space programs are strictly business; for her theyre about protecting the sanctity of the skies. Crowe does however make good use of their contrasting experiences during the drive home from Kanaheles village when they have an encounter on the night road She considers it a sacred vision while he chalks it up to something more prosaic. Other references to Hawaiian mythology are clunky however sincere. Tracys son (Jaeden Lieberher) is obsessed with the subject and pointedly identifies Gilcrest with the god Lono -- echoing the hope that Tracy attaches to his return. Despite a few overstated exchanges McAdams brings a wistful believable confusion to her role. If Alohas earthbound elements are uneven its rocket-launch aspects are downright confounding. The movie enters a weird orbit around covert missions and weaponized payloads. In the strangest sequence Crowe bares his rock n roll heart -- the passion that made Almost Famous such an affecting portrait of fandom -- and unleashes a digital collection of pop-culture artifacts as an antidote to the military-industrial complex. Whether as tech coup or crucial turning point for his main character the scene feels desperately off-key. Yet even when the plot pushes too hard abetted by busy handheld camerawork Crowes use of actual locations and Clay Griffiths astute production design have the ring of authenticity. Early in the film the Hickam Officers Club is well used for a party scene promising high-wire emotional entanglements. But they never quite materialize. Coopers effortless charm notwithstanding Gilcrest is a good-guy cipher from beginning to end. The movies final redemptive gesture -- though beautifully played by Danielle Rose Russell as Tracys hula-dancing daughter -- only reinforces the sense of posturing in most everything that precedes it.

"Aloha says hello but should wave goodbye review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesAloha says hello but should wave goodbye reviewThe twinkle of stars Bradley Cooper and Emma Stone is dimmed by the bright lights around them while director Cameron Crowe seems to have lost his movie magic.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. May 28 2015AlohaStarring Bradley Cooper Emma Stone, Bill Murray Rachel McAdams Alec Baldwin John Krasinski and Danny McBride. Written and directed by Cameron Crowe. At GTA theatres. 120 minutes. PGHello and goodbye to Aloha another dud from a once-hot writer/director and the question must be asked Whatever happened to the Cameron Crowe of the magic movie moment?Moments like the ""Tiny Dancer"" tour bus singalong in Almost Famous. Or Tom Cruises ""Thats more than a dress . . . "" line in Jerry Maguire when he sees Renee Zellweger in a smashing outfit.Article Continued BelowCrowe had a gift for memorable screen instances where meaning was perfectly and often quotably expressed. It seemed effortless but around about the time Elizabethtown flatlined a decade ago strain began to show.Emma Stone and Bradley Cooper star in Cameron Crowes rom-com Aloha in theatres Friday.  (Neal Preston / Columbia Pictures)  And now we have Aloha a delayed and dismal attempt to marry screwball comedy with socially aware drama set in a Hawaii midway between 1950s tourist kitsch and 21st-century environmental angst.Bradley Cooper and Emma Stone are the nominal stars but their twinkle is dimmed by the many bright lights surrounding them -- Bill Murray Rachel McAdams Alec Baldwin John Krasinski and Danny McBride -- in a story too thin and disjointed to serve this much talent.Cooper is Brian Gilcrest a once-respected military contractor who was wounded and shamed by ethical missteps in Afghanistan. Humbled but still cocky hes been offered ""a crappy second chance"" to redeem himself in Honolulu scene of earlier victories with the U.S. space program. Against his will hes assigned a minder buttoned-down air force pilot Allison Ng (Stone) whose social graces are defined by military protocol and whose idea of a festive beverage is peppermint tea. Gilcrests expertise and connections are needed to advance murky and controversial rocket-launching plans shared by the U.S. government (represented by Baldwins barking Gen. Dixon) and private enterprise (Murrays Carson Welch an eccentric billionaire).Access to sacred Hawaiian land must be negotiated with the native residents who naturally are suspicious and Gilchrist is the man to do it. Hes not one for asking hard questions about either his assignments or himself a quality that has advanced his career while sabotaging his happiness.His attention is diverted by the overzealous Ng and also by the presence of a curious ex-girlfriend (McAdams) and her benignly taciturn husband (Krasinski). If Crowe actually knew what he wanted to do with this much star power or his narrative Aloha might have something going for it. But he doesnt and you can actually feel him flailing as he struggles to link comedic and dramatic sequences that either fall flat or make little sense.The use of pop tunes by the Who Fleetwood Mac Elvis Presley Beck and others once so organic to a Cameron Crowe movie now feels like a desperate attempt to fill in cracks.Most disarming of all is Crowes ineptness with scenes that used to come so naturally to him. A running gag about how Cooper and Krasinski communicate through manly back pats and knowing winks rather than verbally comes across as forced rather than funny and weve already seen it in the trailer.The coining of words and phrases such as ""girlfriending"" and ""ultimatum vacation"" represents another failed bid by Crowe to add currency to a movie that isnt even in step with the current calendar. It was supposed to come out last Christmas which explains the Yuletide decorations never a good sign for a movie arriving in summer blockbuster season.And what are we to make of Eric Gautiers dreary and unsteady cinematography? The very least we might expect of a movie set in Hawaii is beautiful scenery yet Gautier and Crowe seem to go out of their way to make the place look as dull claustrophobic and twitchy as possible. Contrast this film with Alexander Paynes The Descendants which was gorgeous to behold and which also had something of substance to say about preserving a threatened paradise.The only saving grace of Aloha is Emma Stone whose natural effervescence manages to shine through even when shes wearing those Top Gun aviator shades that must have been purchased in bulk by the films costumers.She gets on well with Cooper even though she does most of the comedic and dramatic heavy lifting. It makes you wonder how theyd do together in a film of genuine wit and purpose qualities now sadly lacking in the screen output of Cameron Crowe.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsPrince William and Kate coming back to Canada this fallRoyals are scheduled to come to British Columbia and the Yukon but no word on whether they will bring their children.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Aloha Review Cameron Crowes Worst Film Yet | Variety Variety Continue to Variety () Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review Aloha Andrew Barker Senior Features Writer barkerrant 36 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr Courtesy of Columbia Pictures May 28 2015 | 1140AM PT Bradley Cooper plays a disillusioned ex-pilot in this fascinating misfire from writer-director Cameron Crowe. Unbalanced unwieldy and at times nearly unintelligible ""Aloha"" is unquestionably Cameron Crowes worst film. Paced like a record on the wrong speed or a Nancy Meyers movie recut by an over-caffeinated Jean-Luc Godard the film bears all the telltale signs of a poorly executed salvage operation disfigured in the editing bay. But as far as misfires from great American filmmakers go its a fascinating one less a simple failed Cameron Crowe film than a total deconstruction. Given its rather extraordinary bad pre-release buzz and what is sure to be poor word of mouth from any viewer expecting a new ""Jerry Maguire"" (or even a new ""Elizabethtown"") the films commercial prospects look murky. But when faced with a work this fatally misguided one can only hope it will serve an emetic purpose a cleansing of the system before Crowe can get his mojo working again. Speaking of that pre-release buzz the specter of failure surrounding ""Aloha"" took on a life of its own over the past few months. From former Sony Pictures co-chief Amy Pascals fierce critiques in those infamous hacked memos to Hawaiian groups expressing concern sight unseen that the film would represent a whitewashing of native culture the project was put through the wringer long before critics and most industryites even had a chance to see it. As it turns out those concerns are the least of the pics worries. By the time the film is actually unleashed on the world viewers are more likely to be grumbling about the fact that despite an introductory voiceover and numerous rapid-fire bursts of expository dialogue it takes an exceedingly long time to figure out just who the characters are what they want and what theyre doing. ""Aloha"" centers on Brian Gilcrest (Bradley Cooper) a disillusioned former pilot and space aficionado with a shadowy past in Afghanistan who is currently working as a military contractor for a flamboyant industrialist (Bill Murray). Hes en route to Oahu to supervise the ""blessing of a pedestrian gate."" The precise nature and purpose of this task is hazy but it seems to involve some bargaining with natives on a sanctuary the relocation of ancient bones and a mysterious satellite launch. Immediately after stepping off the plane Gilcrest is confronted by old flame Tracy (Rachel McAdams) who is married to a hard-working Air Force recruit (John Krasinski) who has recently stopped speaking. (At times this simply means hes taciturn; at others he appears to be an actual mute.) Meanwhile the local colonel (Danny McBride) has arranged for Gilcrest to be accompanied by a handler -- a fast-talking by-the-book fighter pilot named Allison Ng (Emma Stone). Shes proudly one-quarter Hawaiian a plot point thats sure to raise red flags though in context it plays more like a running joke akin to the lily-white frat brother who talks endlessly about his vague Cherokee heritage. On that note while its perfectly germane to ask why an actual Hawaiian actress couldnt have tackled the part ""Aloha"" is hardly culturally insensitive. Its true that the major characters are all haole (Ngs quarter aside) as one might expect from a film set mostly on a U.S. military base. But to be fair ""Aloha"" goes deeper into the vicissitudes of Hawaiian heritage than any Hollywood film of recent memory. Real-life Nation of Hawaii leader Dennis ""Bumpy"" Kanahele plays himself in a substantial cameo role -- wearing a T-shirt that reads ""Hawaiian by Birth American by Force"" -- precisely to lament mainlander imperialism and island myths factor heavily if typically obliquely into the story. As Ng and Gilcrest criss-cross the islands doing whatever it is that theyre supposed to be doing they hatch a hesitant romance and may or may not have a supernatural experience while Gilcrests sporadic discussions with Tracy hint at the questionable parentage of her preteen daughter (Danielle Rose Russell). The overarching themes here appear to be Gilcrests redemption -- though what hes being redeemed for is never satisfactorily articulated - and the preservation of Hawaiis sacred aura as underscored by Tracys precocious videocamera-toting son (Jaeden Lieberher) who proves to be an encyclopedic fount of knowledge about the fertility god Lono. Most but certainly not all of these divergent narrative strands come together by the end yet the filmmaking is so haphazard that its hard to care about any of it. Crowes once-deft touch for breezy epigrammatic profundity has eluded him on his past few features from the self-parodic ""Elizabethtown"" to the harmlessly mediocre ""We Bought a Zoo"" but its hard to understand how a writer-director as good as he is could make a film this thoroughly scattered and dysfunctional. Sometimes ""Aloha"" almost feels like an expression of frustration a frantic feature-length attempt to bundle all his narrative tics and stray emotional bric-a-brac into a rocket and blast it off into space. And as for the characters Gilcrest is both over-explained and inscrutable and Cooper never quite finds the right register to bring him to life. Ng is almost fleshed out by Stones energetic performance though the characters essential contradictions -- for one shes terrified of the idea of weaponized satellites polluting the peaceful purity of the Hawaiian sky even though shes a fighter pilot -- keep her feeling like an undercooked writerly device. Cooper has charming chemistry with McAdams in individual scenes but their relationship never quite gels. And an unkempt Murray appears to have been given free rein to simply goof off through his scenes making the pics already befuddling military intrigue subplot even more surreal. Despite all these faults the film isnt entirely unpleasant. Alec Baldwin gets to unleash his most full-throated bellow as a dyspeptic general. Cooper and Krasinski have a pantomimed conversation thats quite funny. And Stone and Murray stage a dance-off to Hall and Oates thats appealing for reasons which should be self-explanatory even if it might as well have been shot at the wrap party for all the sense it makes to the narrative. Production design camerawork and art direction are all topnotch and the film showcases a bevy of beautiful island landscapes with nary a swimming pool nor a beach resort in sight. Hawaiian folk music supplements Crowes predictable classic rock selections on the soundtrack well enough and a score from Sigur Ros offshoot Jonsi and Alex is appropriately transporting.

Art says July 8 2016 at 132 pm So its reprehensible when non-white characters are played by white actors but progressive when white characters are played by non-white actors? Got it. Reply Leah Ma says May 15 2016 at 524 pm Id be the first the criticize movie for whitewashing movies. However I have to say a person who is 1/4 Chinese is not likely to look Chinese. I have 2 granddaughters. We did DNA tests on them. One is 29% Chinese. She has blond hair and pale golden skin and doesnt look in the slightest bit Chinese. She looks like a Viking. The other is 22% Chinese. Her eyes are a bit Chinese face shape a bit-if you know you can see it. If you dont then you dont see it. Ive seen many people who are 1/4 Asian and so far none of them were recognizably Asian. Guys youve gone too far this time. Also I have seen Eurasians although very few with blue green or gray eyes. Ive just never seen anyone 1/4 Asian who looks Asian. Reply lindachance28 says December 30 2015 at 936 am Horrible movie but I never watched We Bought a Zoo so who knows. Definitely time and brain cells I will not get back the only saving grace is I bailed before it was over because I just couldnt anymore. Reply Erwin says December 24 2015 at 601 pm I just finished watchin the film... its a heartwarming one.. loved it.. Reply Janet G. says December 22 2015 at 256 pm Loved the movie. Found it easy to follow. Each scene foretold the next. Liked the characters. Thought Emma Stones character being 1/4 Hawaiian was supposed to be a running joke as she didnt look Hawaiian was proud that she was and so had to tell everyone. Wouldnt have worked with a Hawaiian actress who looked Hawaiian. Thought the dance scene between Emma and Bill did have a point or rather a couple of points. Like the Hawaiian music. Couldnt understand why you thought movie was hard to follow. The kid explained it all. Wished you had liked it. Reply Janet G. says December 16 2015 at 928 am Loved the movie. A light romantic comedy. Nothing about it was hard to understand. Too much over thinking by professional critics. Reply fd says December 16 2015 at 755 am I LOVED this movie. It shows that you cant trust critics reviews. It was a super feel good movie. I think the actors did a great job. Reply makai says August 16 2015 at 426 pm Aloha is a movie that is meant for people who enjoy more than just a movie. Critics such as andrew barker do not appreciate this movie for what it is. Yes it might seem a bit confusing at times but when was different such a bad aspect. Aloha is a representation of love which in more ways than one is confusing. To truly appreciate this movie you have to look at it from more than a critics eye. If you are looking for the editing or script you find yourself lost in the movie. But if you watch it as a representation of love you will find yourself lost in its story. I suggest that Andrew Barker takes a second chance at this movie and instead of going into the theater to watch a movie go into the theater to take a trip into the story. Reply dawn says June 11 2015 at 1123 am worst movie ever boring and confusing Reply JR says June 4 2015 at 1231 pm I so disagree with it being a bad movie. It was entertaining the plot was as believable as Star Wars the acting was believable and I think the emotional trip we were taken on during the last scene by Danielle Rose Russel was outstanding. Not sure if what you say about the directing writing and production are true or not not why I watch a movie. I do know it was a nice escape for my wife and I. Reply Chuck Strickler says May 31 2015 at 110 pm OK Ill play the devils advocate. I enjoyed the film. Didnt have any intellectual spasms over following the script. Found the underlying ""pro-generation"" cloaking to be very much in sync with real life situations in century 21. The music was well written and performed IMO. And found the film to be much in the category of others doomed by critics wisdom. As a rule of thumb (for me at least) if critics bad-mouth it.....be sure to see it; its certain to be heart-warming. Reply JPNS says May 31 2015 at 205 pm Two thumbs up for your opinion - a very pleasant non pretentious bit of movie-made fun. Reply Bob says May 30 2015 at 1223 pm ""Misfires from great American filmmakers...?"" Crowe should be picking playlists for TIDAL. Reply Ima Right says May 30 2015 at 805 am I think all his films SUCK HOLLYWEIRD CRAP yeah more anti American garbage from the liberal Hollyweird leftist I stop going to movies a decade ago except for a few exceptions like Appaloosa which is an American classic western with Ed Harris nobody saw and Super 8 which was a great throw back to great 70s and 80s sci fi horror without all the blood gore sex and violence needed but a bit too much CGI for me. Drewp is right too many pretty faces not enough talent anymore just like in music which is nothing but cookie cutter pop poop or rap or crap country braindead crap Reply kenjimoto says June 2 2015 at 1154 pm There are excellent ESL classes now available at reasonable costs. Reply mm says May 30 2015 at 818 pm Your comment makes no sense. Reply humancorrectoroutlook.com says May 29 2015 at 334 pm Me thinks this editor or whatever calls himself is too lily white but I guess thats why he is a Hollywood guy. They seem to divide everyone by skin color. Anyways who cares about movies made by these type of people. Not sure who I ended up reading stupid stuff about stupid stuff written by little stupid white kids that live in some stupid place. Reply Drewp says May 29 2015 at 135 pm lots of pretty faces-thats about it. No script story or dialogue worth mentioning. total waste of talent and  Reply Freddie says May 28 2015 at 1109 pm Seems like Crowe is at his best when he writes about what he knows and what is closer to his own character. It seems like after Almost Famous he completely had nothing else to say. He needs to get back to his roots and make movies that are heavily intertwined with music. He should be making great biopics about Musicians like Marvin Gaye.

Sexist (Video) San Andreas Review Dwayne Johnson Does His Best Charlton Heston as California Quakes Sony Leak 28 Lies Hollywood Agents Tell Studio Executives About Their Actor Clients The characters in Cameron Crowes latest film are sketchy at best and the dialogue that comes out of their mouths never rings true Cameron Crowe has turned into George Lucas and not in a good way. After an acclaimed beloved trilogy as a writer-director (""Say Anything"" ""Almost Famous"" ""Jerry Maguire"") Crowe has blown his opportunities and the good will of his audience with disappointment after disappointment ""Vanilla Sky"" ""We Bought a Zoo"" and the astoundingly unbearable ""Elizabethtown."" ""Aloha"" doesnt reverse that trend offering a script so contrived and artificial that not even the combined sparkle of Bradley Cooper Emma Stone and the state of Hawaii itself can save it. See Video Bradley Cooper and Emma Stone Say Aloha in First Trailer for Cameron Crowe Dramedy (Video) At its best Crowes work can call to mind that of his friend and mentor Billy Wilder; the situations might be amplified and his characters might speak in screenwriter-ese but his films nonetheless reveal something about the human condition. From ""Vanilla Sky"" onward unfortunately Crowe seems to have been stricken with some form of tone-deafness that curdles quirky into shrill. Some exceedingly abrupt and thrown-together exposition introduces us to Brian (Cooper) who was once a starry-eyed dreamer with visions of the cosmos but now that NASA has basically gone broke the Air Force vet finds himself in the employ of billionaire Carson Welch (Bill Murray) one of the private-sector entrepreneurs who now dominate the space race. (Both ""Aloha"" and ""Tomorrowland"" with differing degrees of awkwardness seem to be aiming for the demographic of people who wanted to be astronauts when they grew up.) Welchs upcoming rocket launch sends Brian back to the 50th state where hes commissioned to smooth things over with a local Hawaiian sovereigntist (Dennis ""Bumpy"" Kanahele as himself) to build a pedestrian gate on the Air Force base on the site of a former burial ground. Brians got his own ghosts of the past to deal with notably a reunion with former flame Tracy (Rachel McAdams) whos now married to Woody (John Krasinski) an Air Force pilot whos non-talkative in the extreme. Making up for Woodys silence is Captain Allison Ng (Stone) a chatterbox whos been assigned as Brians liaison. Shes the walking manifestation of all of Brians crushed hopes and dreams and she also represents Brians last chance at love. (We know this because Crowe has Allison yell ""I was your last chance"" at Brian after he has momentarily disappointed her.) Also Read Cameron Crowe Jokes About Bruce Jenners Reported Transition in Leaked Sony Email Crowe interweaves these two-dimensional characters with all the Hawaiian mythology pop songs and Christmas decorations that he can muster but with the exception of one scene where Alec Baldwin yells -- and who doesnt like to watch Alec Baldwin yelling? -- there are virtually no moments in ""Aloha"" where characters interact in a believable way or that the plot doesnt come off like a series of contrivances. The deepest understanding we get of any of these characters is that none of them would say the things that Crowe makes come out of their mouths. Krasinski dodging the bullet of the awful dialogue here winds up giving the best performance. Poor Cooper doesnt fare nearly so well with his one silent scene a third-act staring contest (during a hula class no less) that Crowe clearly thinks is going to be a signature moment that instead feels tacked-on and phony. Also Read Irrational Man Cannes Review Woody Allen Lets Emma Stone Shine McAdams and especially Stone get saddled with some truly terrible sparkly-eyed moments of flirtation; their characters are competent career women (Allisons a fighter pilot Tracy runs the bases forensics lab) but ""Aloha"" essentially reduces both of them to whether or not theyre going to hook up with dreamy Brian. (His blue eyes are mentioned several times by both ladies.) In an attempt to silence the chatter about ""Aloha"" that surfaced in the leaked Sony e-mails Crowe himself showed up to introduce the Los Angeles press screening assuring us that the film has always been designed as a love letter to Hawaii. He may have set out to serve audiences a luau spread featuring a crispy roast pig but the results taste more like Spam. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Neal Preston/AP Chris Vognar Culture Critic chrisvognar cvognardallasnews.com Bradley Cooper and Emma Stones romantic comedy Aloha is a tinny affair May. 28 2015 102pm Close Sharing really is caring... Close Join the conversation... With Chris Vognar Share This Story Share Discuss Meh Cameron Crowe has made a movie about a weary cynic who seeks a second chance and finds redemption in the arms of an idealistic lady. Actually hes made that movie several times; some of them including Jerry Maguire are quite good. His latest Aloha is not.The cynic is Bradley Coopers Brian Gilcrest a once admirable military contractor now smiling through the task of doing dirty work for a shabby billionaire (Bill Murray). Gilcrest returns to his old Hawaiian haunts ostensibly for some glad-handing PR duty and encounters the idealistic lady (Emma Stone) a can-do Air Force captain with an emotional attachment to the island and its traditions (which are treated with a fair amount of respect). Theres also a second woman Gilcrests old flame played by Rachel McAdams.Crowe was once the master of the rock n roll screwball comedy. His movies were sentimental but smart driven by a gift of gab and a knack for the emotional crescendo. But hes been going through the motions for the past several years and Aloha for all its spasms of charm feels like a push-button romance its heroes glibly spouting lines with the hope that the words come to mean something. Bradley Cooper left and Alec Baldwin in ""Aloha."" Neal Preston/TNS Occasionally they do. Its easy to buy Cooper as a man of potential who decided to cash in and we get some glimmer and spark as Stones Capt. Allison Ng tries to crack through his glib shell. The main problem is that the rest of the movie is just as glib. The big speeches and gestures start flowing before weve even come to know the people giving them. Aloha is Crowe at his most floridly cute right down to the precocious little kid who finds hope in the infinite wonder of outer space.The most human touches come from the supporting players the scene-stealers not tasked with the responsibility of carrying thinly sketched character arcs. Chief among these is Danny McBride as a go-along-to-get-along colonel who cant stop waving and flexing his fingers the air a nervous tic that has morphed into what passes here as a defining trait.Aloha is so aggressively pleased with itself from the start that it never bothers to earn its big emotional payoff. The results are tinny and too easy forced whimsy masquerading as firm convictions and deep thoughts. ALOHA (C)Directed by Cameron Crowe. PG-13 (some language including suggestive comments). 105 mins.

"Aloha review Hawaiian love triangle - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Aloha review Hawaii so-so Aloha Neal Preston AP Cameron Crowes romantic triangle of Emma Stone from left Bradley Cooper and Rachel McAdams falters in ""Aloha."" Cameron Crowes romantic triangle of Emma Stone from left Bradley Cooper and Rachel McAdams falters in ""Aloha."" (Neal Preston AP) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune A blue-chip cast cant save Cameron Crowes latest attempt to recapture the magic. For contexts sake the new Cameron Crowe film ""Aloha"" is a tick up from the dregs of ""Elizabethtown"" and a tick down from ""We Bought a Zoo."" The Media Action Network for Asian-Americans calls it a ""whitewashed"" version of Hawaii a state that is roughly 30 percent Caucasian in real life and as ""Aloha"" presents it roughly 97 percent in fake life. Same old Hollywood ethnographic story. And yet the recent Alexander Payne picture ""The Descendants"" likewise set in Hawaii made hash of similar objections simply by being sharp and witty and astute about its chosen characters.Despite a blue-chip cast ""Aloha"" is just frustrating. It can barely tell its story straight and Crowes attempt to get back to the days of ""Jerry Maguire"" and ""Almost Famous"" is bittersweet in ways unrelated to the narratives seriocomic vein. Private military contractor Brian Gilchrist (Bradley Cooper) with a checkered resume returns to Hickam Air Force Base in Honolulu. In his new job he works for an all-powerful billionaire (Bill Murray) partnering with the U.S. military to send up his own personal rocket for reasons the film gradually reveals.Theres a triangular romance afoot. Gilchrists ex (Rachel McAdams) is now married to a taciturn Air Force pilot (John Krasinski). Yet they still have that thing they had before Gilchrist messed up and closed down emotionally which is what men do -- even in a Cameron Crowe movie which never lacks for florid gassy showoff-y monologues. Emma Stone plays Gilchrists tightly wound handler a fighter pilot who retains the idealism Gilchrist once had. The first encounter among Cooper McAdams and Stone is so awkward and unsettled that it becomes the movies own albatross. There are some moments most of them thanks to McAdams. She can make truth out of contrivance often nonverbally dramatizing contradictory impulses within a single moment. I found myself leaning into a kitchen scene between McAdams and Cooper; in the space of a few seconds the actress activates her characters full array of concerns and regrets and conflicted feelings.Elsewhere either the plot obstacles are phony or the characters accomplish too little. Danny McBride plays an officer whose only trait is a penchant for gesticulating nervously. Nobody ever says anything as prosaic as ""hello"" or ""whats up?"" in a Crowe movie; they enter the frame and start monologuing dropping references to Coachella music festival even when they make little sense coming from whoevers doing the referencing. Sony defends Aloha after white-washing criticism Tribune wire reports Sony has refuted claims that Cameron Crowes romantic comedy ""Aloha"" presents a ""white-washed"" version of the Hawaiian islands.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Ann Hornaday May 28 2015 Follow AnnHornaday Somewhere on the incoherent pu pu platter that is Cameron Crowes ""Aloha"" a nifty romantic comedy congeals and shrivels inexplicably untouched. Crowe -- who gave the world such deathless lines as ""You had me at Hello "" the man who put the boom box in Lloyd Doblers defiantly upstretched arms -- spends so much time running away from his roots in ""Aloha"" that he misses the point of his own movie. Only a filmmaker out to put a permanent stake in the rom-com would take a couple of fizzily attractive movie stars and plop them into a story that hinges not on a long-awaited first kiss or third-act Hail Mary but on sundry bits of arcana involving Hawaiian mythology military privatization space weaponry and -- be still our beating hearts -- sound transducing. ""Aloha"" is such an inchoate mess such a forced insular self-pleasing misfire that plotting it out can be a challenge. Bradley Cooper plays Brian Gilcrest an Air Force veteran and military contractor who as he laboriously explains during a saggy opening voice-over developed an obsession with space as a young boy. After a promising career at Hickam Air Force Base he went over to the ""gray side"" signing on with a billionaire (Bill Murray) who wants to get into the private space-flight racket. As ""Aloha"" opens Gilcrest is returning to Honolulu to nudge the enterprise along by greasing some local palms especially those of a local king played by real-life native leader Dennis ""Bumpy"" Kanahele. Gilcrests mission is complicated by two women the overeager Air Force captain assigned to escort him and an old girlfriend who is living on the base with her pilot husband and two kids. As the wide-eyed puppyish escort Allison Ng Emma Stone takes perky officiousness into the realm of derangement; its up to each filmgoer to decide for him- or herself whether to believe for one minute that shes one quarter native Hawaiian. (The film has come in for criticism for ""whitewashing"" native Hawaiian culture notwithstanding Kanaheles presence and near-constant digressions into the islands traditional animist beliefs.) As Gilcrests erstwhile squeeze Rachel McAdams spends most of ""Aloha"" at sea -- at least metaphorically -- with the unreadable Gilcrest and her unintelligible husband. An early scene where they make goo-goo eyes at one another while a military casket emerges from the belly of a plane hes just flown in on doesnt bode well for the taste or tonal dissonance of whats to come. 1 of 99 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad x What not to watch View Photos A sampling of recent movies that received one star or less from Washington Post film critics.

Stephanie Merry writes ""Ice Age Collision Course"" the fifth installment in the 14-year-long saga of animated prehistoric animals will with any luck also be the last. Lazy scattershot and excruciatingly unfunny the movie is a hazard to the very young who might come away with the erroneous impression that movies dont get any better than this."" Read the full review. Blue Sky Studios/Twentieth Century Fox Film Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Taste-wise Crowe is at constant pains to prove his bona fides. As with most of his films he jams as many musical cues as he can into ""Aloha"" from the Who and Hall amp; Oates to a cameo from slack key guitarist Ledward Kaapana in an attempt to sell scenes and emotions he otherwise cant justify or resolve. While Gilcrest and Ng bounce around scenic locales and featureless motel rooms they launch into weird non sequitur-laden jags about space sex Gilcrests failure to commit and whatever else comes into their dippy quippy always camera-ready little heads. Edited by Crowes longtime cutter Joe Hutshing ""Aloha"" has a choppy scattershot feel that keeps the audience uncomfortably disoriented as a series of ""Where did that come from?"" moments accumulate into a finale as unaffecting as it is unearned. (A penultimate passage when Gilcrest exchanges supposedly cathartic glances with a supporting character is particularly puzzling given that her inner life has received zero attention for the preceding hour and a half.) The emotional hurdles are never higher than mere bumps which Crowe quickly tries to smooth over with a patch of quirky dialogue an adorable musical interlude or putting someone in a silly hat. In fact the most improbably satisfying moments of ""Aloha"" belong to a blowhard general played by Alec Baldwin whose most florid outburst against Gilcrests entitled self-satisfaction could easily be directed at the very movie hes in. To quote Amy Pascal the former Sony co-president whose hacked e-mails last winter revealed her lack of faith in ""Aloha"" ""It never not even once ever works."" As with many of the leaked exchanges with her colleagues Pascals words formed a candid tutorial in Hollywood sausage-making and in a sobering sense the principles that guide our common culture and chief export commodity. As Pascal reminded her colleagues the studio had ""a lot of dough"" tied up in ""Aloha"" which makes its artistic failure that much more depressing. Sony makes its money on ""Spider-Man"" sequels ""Smurfs"" and ""Paul Blart"" but its also one of the few big studios left that tries to make the kind of mid-range movie that Hollywood supposedly doesnt produce anymore -- romantic comedies adult dramas political thrillers by the likes of David O. Russell David Fincher Paul Greengrass and yes Cameron Crowe. They might have put their money on the wrong horse this time but we should hope and pray that Sony at least stays in the race. PG-13. At area theaters. Contains some profanity and suggestive comments. 105 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

He falls for an Air Force watchdog assigned to him. USA TodayDespite a cast that includes Bradley Cooper Emma Stone and Bill Murray Cameron Crowes latest film about a former Air Force golden boy falls flat.Bradley Cooper (left) and Rachel McAdams in a scene from ""Aloha."" Some Native Hawaiians including the states film commissioner are taking issue with using a Hawaiian word to title a mainstream Hollywood movie.(Photo Sony Pictures)Story HighlightsCritics rating 2 stars (out of 5)The actors are talented but are given little to work with.Crowe in the past has created unique believable worlds but not here.Life is full of surprises.For instance Cameron Crowe wrote and directed ""Aloha"" a film starring Bradley Cooper Emma Stone Rachel McAdams Bill Murray Danny McBride and John Krasinski. Even Alec Baldwin shows up for a short time.It sounds like a cant-miss proposition. But ...The irony is that in films like ""... Say Anything"" and ""Almost Famous"" Crowe creates wholly authentic characters who say and do believable things. Sure not everyone is familiar enough with rock stars to know how they behave but in ""Almost Famous"" you believe thats how they act because Crowe (who has plenty of firsthand experience around them) puts us in that world.But in ""Aloha"" his story and his dialogue betray him.Its baffling.More Movie reviews and featuresCooper stars as Brian Gilcrest a former Air Force hotshot with his eye to the skies -- as in space. But the economy tanked and he went to work for a billionaire named Carson Welch (Murray) who has joined the newest space race among rich people in the private sector. Gilcrest screwed up and nearly got killed in Afghanistan and fell farther from grace after Welch abandoned him for the error. (We learn all this in a rushed voiceover.)Now hes going back to Hawaii where he was stationed and had his best moments -- to help get a new civilian gate on the base blessed so that the bones beneath it can be moved.Its quite a fall for the former golden boy and everyone Gilcrest runs into reminds him of it. Except for Tracy Woodside (Rachel McAdams) his old flame who is now married to John called ""Woody"" (Krasinski) -- the fighter pilot who just so happened to fly Gilcrest back to Hawaii.Emma Stone and Bradley Cooper cant elevate a soggy script in ""Aloha."" (Photo Columbia Pictures)So weve got that bit of awkwardness going for us. Then comes Allison Ng (Stone) the straight-arrow fighter pilot assigned to babysit Gilcrest. Shes nuts for him from the start in a way that defies the logic of her character. In this scenario and others Crowe seems to have dropped us into the middle of something without the information we need leaving us to fend for ourselves.Gilcrest has to sell the native Hawaiian people on the new gate. Luckily he is old friends with the king Dennis ""Bumpy"" Kanahele (playing himself). Luckily Ng is as she tells everyone repeatedly a quarter Hawaiian. She connects with Bumpy even more than his old friend Gilcrest does.Its not much of an assignment but it gets Gilcrest back in the game and back on board with Welch. Meanwhile he and Ng are going to the Woodsides for dinner where Tracy obviously has some unresolved feelings (not all good) for Gilcrest and some tension thanks to her husbands silence after missions.Ng is all but throwing herself at Gilcrest who in that Bradley Cooper havent-shaved-for-three-days way puts up token resistance. Somewhere in there the civilian mission involving an upcoming launch begins to play a role both in terms of Gilcrests employment and in Ngs soulful non-military side.Its a big soap opera set against blastoffs none of which is convincing.AZCENTRALAloha (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsIts not the actors faults. We know what all of them can do. But Stones character particularly at first is such a cliche it almost seems as if shes playing a parody. (Shes not.)Cooper is given lines like these as a storm approaches and his Gilcrest turns to Ng ""I go hard. And I go deep. And sometimes I break things.""He cant sell it. No one could sell it. Its just bad.The tension picks up a bit as the story moves along. (To Crowes credit as with any of his productions the musical selections are perfect.) But after some jagged edges the storys resolution is absurdly smooth and unbelievable.Crowe can be a great storyteller a terrific director whose characters make us believe in them and in what theyre doing. That doesnt happen in ""Aloha"" which famously means hello and goodbye. Stick with the latter definition here.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Lovers of sequels and reboots take a hike. ""Aloha"" is not the movie youre looking for. Fans of challenging originality and creative surprise gather near. Were here to celebrate the arrival of one of the seasons riskiest films. Cameron Crowes long-awaited Hawaiian project is an original mixtape of a movie a dozen tight tracks of turbulent brilliance. Rather than reaching into the remake cupboard for an old story template this amiable snap-crackle movie is made from whole cloth fine as Indian silk. Its as much about human individuals as standard romance and comedy. When high-wire talents like Bradley Cooper Emma Stone and Bill Murray sign on with a seriously gifted filmmaker you know they didnt travel out there for tiki cocktails. In clever hits like ""Almost Famous"" and ""Jerry Maguire"" Crowe proved hes an original personal audacious writer/director who would rather search with the audience for answers about his likable characters than blab them out. ""Aloha"" brims with star power and a story that isnt so humdrum that you know whats coming before the opening credits are over. The story belongs to Cooper playing Brian Gilcrest a former Air Force flying hero turned private aerospace contractor. Civilian life has given him not many safe havens. Hes returned with personal anxieties (the wife divorcing him for a comic book mogul didnt help) leg injuries (one nervously funny) and PTSD stomach acid. Recruited to oversee a private satellite launch by tycoon Carson Welch (Murray with a smile of smug self-satisfaction) he has to kowtow to the billionaire who gives him back rubs that pound his spine like an MMA champion bout. The mission is based in the hometown of his old flame Tracy Woodside (Rachel McAdams) and home base of his Mach-10 Air Force keeper Capt. Allison Ng (Stone) who sees the handsome vet as a dream fixer-upper. ALOHA 1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for language suggestive comments. Has he undertaken too great a task in launching an ultrasecret payload? Or trying to decide whether to commit to either of two quarrelsome romantic magnets? Brians enjoyable headaches are the kind of wistful breathlessly ridiculous story that occupies a special place in Crowes heart. He adores actors and values warm fluid scenes focused on how they look and respond together more than old-school storytelling. There are repeated references to the island spirits who arrive when the breeze blows. It feels the same when the long and winding plot travels on whatever side trips the wind takes it. Everyone in the film collides like billiard balls enchanting us with the wisecracks or spitting anger that each contact triggers. The conversation is lovely; theres a long phone chat between Allison and her mother about what an attractive mess Brian is that is the peak of bone-dry humor. Yet often Crowe designs unspoken scenes that express more philosophy than endless monologues. Scenes like Stones ""dance with the devil"" with Murray at a military disco party or Cooper watching McAdams young daughter at hula draw you in so close that you can hear the actors heartbeats. Without a word you get every feeling happening inside them. Though ""Aloha"" is set in the culture of satellites the true focus is the way most of the people in it explore possibility and self-discovery. Its an emotionally exposed ironic ramble through the Pacific frontier. How delightful to see a film that begins and closes in outer space be so warmly stargazing. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.
