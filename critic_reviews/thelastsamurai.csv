When we meet Tom Cruises Captain Nathan Algren in 1876 hes a wreck drinking heavily to drown his memories of massacring Indians on the American frontier lost in despairing cynicism. Then hes recruited to help train a modern army in Japan the chief function of which is to put down a samurai rebellion against the new dishonorable Westernizing ways that his army symbolizes.

Actioner about an American soldier who takes his fighting skills to Japan circa 1876 is inspired by both ""Dances With Wolves"" and ""Braveheart"" but is dominated by Tom Cruise. Release will ride his name to brawny but not stellar B.O. ""The Last Samurai"" is as rich in period and historical background as it is deficient in fresh dramatic and thematic ideas. This luxuriously appointed actioner about an American soldier who takes his fighting skills to Japan circa 1876 is already known in the trade as ""Dances With Samurai."" Edward Zwicks transcultural epic is transparently inspired not only by Kevin Costners Indian saga but by the underdog heroics of ""Braveheart."" Far too dominated by Tom Cruise when an ensemble of interesting supporting characters would have helped flesh the story out considerably as they did in Mel Gibsons film this Warner Bros. release will ride the stars name to brawny but perhaps not stellar B.O. Clearly enamored of the culture it examines while resolutely remaining an outsiders romanticization of it yarn is disappointingly content to recycle familiar attitudes about the nobility of ancient cultures Western despoilment of them liberal historical guilt the unrestrainable greed of capitalists and the irreducible primacy of Hollywood movie stars. In a handsome but borderline ponderous manner that most resembles its directors approach in ""Legends of the Fall"" it also feeds on scenic splendor a key moment in Japans opening to the West and some capably staged action that pays due homage to Akira Kurosawa among other cinematic samurai masters. After a decade in the Indian campaigns on the heels of Civil War service Cruises Captain Nathan Algren is a disillusioned drunken wreck a paid spokesman for the Winchester gun company who can barely talk or shoot straight. Nevertheless he receives an offer from a nattily attired Japanese businessman Omura (well-known Japanese director Masato Harada) to come to Japan to instruct the Imperial Army in the techniques of modern warfare in an arrangement that will also greatly benefit both Omura and Winchester. These early scenes are seriously underwhelming simply because its clearly beyond Cruises reach to play a drunk; the actor is simply incapable of impersonating a man who loses control. Fortunately hes soon forced to go on the wagon; after arriving in Yokohama and conducting some preliminary training Nathans far-from-ready unit is sent to take on a renegade samurai band thats attacked a railway that just happens to belong to Omura. Hopelessly outmatched the emperors men are massacred and the defeated Japanese officer commits seppuku. But the exotic Nathan is spared and spirited away to the samurais remote mountain village. Pic downshifts into a calmer quieter mood here as Nathan uncertain of whats in store for him recovers from wounds dons native garb picks up some Japanese and slowly gets to know the leader of the community the imposing Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). In unlikely command of decent English Katsumoto once fought in the Emperors Guard and was a personal teacher of the emperor. But offended by his countrys sudden embrace of the new and the youthful emperors call for samurai to lay down their arms Katsumoto has decided to make a last stand for tradition for the ways of his ancestors. As he represents such venerable values as loyalty nobility and discipline against the implied contamination of Western-led ""progress"" Katsumoto immediately becomes the storys most compelling figure a status enhanced by Watanabes forcefully charismatic performance. Katsumotos rigorous highly evolved approach to life deeply impresses Nathan who is still haunted by memories of his participation in the slaughter of Indians while under the command of Gen. George Custer whom he hated. Ironically Katsumoto has always admired the foolhardy Indian fighter albeit from afar due to his willingness to fight to the death against great odds. Surrounded by Katsumotos expert swordsmen the American dedicates himself to mastering their skills taking plenty of hits and spills before earning their respect. Katsumoto fully accepts Nathan as a brother-in-arms when the latter comes to his urgent aide during a murderous ninja attack on the village. Less accepting is Taka (Koyuki) Katsumotos beautiful sister and the wife of a man Nathan killed in the initial clash. Long humiliated by Nathans presence in her home which her brother has mandated Taka exchanges many furtive glances with her unwanted guest but only slowly softens her attitude toward him. After a trip to Tokyo results in Katsumotos humiliation arrest and close-call escape the now-obsolete warrior is ready to commit seppuku. But rousing his friend with an account of the battle of Thermopylae Nathan hatches a plan by which their band of 500 might entrap the Imperial Armys two regiments and stand a fighting chance to discourage it if not ultimately beat it. If the samurai must go down at least they will do so fighting. For this story of a quasi-suicidal last stand it would have helped if Nathan had possessed a mad devil-may-care streak a reckless death wish that would have propelled him into insane combat mode. But once again what you see is Cruise dedicatedly laboring to be fierce courageous and resourceful in a way that seems merely like a 19th century variation on his approach to tasks in the ""Mission Impossible"" pictures. Spotlighting tactics that vividly recall the guerrilla warfare techniques of ""Braveheart"" wherein the few got the better of the many for a while the climactic battles feature a very high casualty rate and are unsettling due to the inequity of the arms used by the respective forces -- cannons and Howitzers by the army only swords and arrows by the samurai. Ultimate result is a foregone conclusion but final twists involving Nathans fate and an imperially dictated comeuppance feel phony and tacked on as a contrived sop to conventional audience expectations. With ace lenser John Toll behind the camera ""The Last Samurai"" is physically impressive. New Zealand and Japanese locations give the surroundings an air of unspoiled purity and beauty while Lilly Kilverts production design and Ngila Dicksons costumes are rich in eye-catching detail but not self-consciously exotic. Except for the battles the film is not really epic in scope although there is some nice scene-setting in Yokohama harbor and a particularly convincing long-perspective shot of 1876 San Francisco. Combat is effectively handled in a realistic vein with no attempt at fanciful ""Crouching Tiger""-like action. Hans Zimmer whose 100th motion picture score this is occasionally inflects the instrumentations of his industrious compositions with Japanese motifs. As far as Cruise is concerned there is far too much the feeling of the camera needing to be on him as much as possible. Sporting beard flowing locks and his trademark intense seriousness the actor conveys his own enthusiasm and respect for the culture the picture examines but only indicates Nathans inner mutation which is the key dramatic movement in the story. The intent of his characterization is clear -- to find redemption and reclaim his true self -- but minus much illumination. Aside from Watanabe other thesps have one-note characters to play. As a Brit long in Japan who gives Nathan his initial bearings and sporadically helps out Timothy Spall brings effervescent good humor to the sort of role once held under patent by Robert Morley. Tony Goldwyn cuts an ambiguous figure as a fellow army officer of Nathans whom the latter hates for his unquestioning manifest-destiny attitude while young martial arts newcomer Shin Koyamada shows marked screen presence as Katsumotos expert archer son.

Starring Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe. Directed by Ed Zwick. (Rated R. 150 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Most historical epics are not really about the time they depict but about the era in which they were made. And so it is today with ""The Last Samurai"" an old-fashioned adventure thats really a modern and very emotional lament about the encroachments of technology and the dangers of American hegemony. Either by accident or design - it would even be more interesting if they did it by accident - director and co-writer Ed Zwick and producer-star Tom Cruise have made a 19th century epic that gains its power by tapping into a host of contemporary terrors the fear of modern weaponry of cold commerce destroying nature and ancient culture and of a vanishing American integrity. Cruises undeniable star voltage makes it all palatable and the film is gorgeous to behold and even to listen to from the rolling green hills to the galloping horses to the ""Lohengrin""-like theme music on the sound track. Just dont pinch yourself when Cruise comes riding up dressed as a samurai. There are moments in the film where if the audience were to step back even for a second the whole edifice might collapse under a cascade of derisive laughter. For a man best known for his smile Cruise takes himself very seriously. But then why shouldnt he? Who better than Cruise - bearded and blue- eyed - to bear the weight of the Western mans sins? In ""The Last Samurai"" he is stabbed shot and beat up on multiple occasions practically every other scene. Only later do we realize weve been witnessing in effect a purification rite whereby he might toss away his old garb with his old life and assume the robes first of a student and then of a warrior. He certainly starts the film in need of redemption. Capt. Algren (Cruise) is a Civil War hero turned drunk trapped in a spiral of guilt that he cant assuage. As an Indian fighter he participated in an act of genocide - the cold-blooded slaughter of an entire encampment of women and children. We first meet him in San Francisco stumbling through a demonstration on behalf of Winchester rifles. Zwick shows us San Francisco in 1876 a three-second shot of a cable car going down a hill on a foggy night and its so beautiful and convincing it makes one wish the story might pause there. But no Algren is off to Japan. His old Indian Wars commander Bagley (Tony Goldwyn) whom Algren despises gets him a job with the Japanese government. His assignment is to train the Japanese army in the use of American weaponry so that they might put down a Samurai uprising. In one of the more vivid scenes the Samurai emerge out of mist in a forest to lay waste to the untrained army. Theyre like monsters appearing out of the air or like subconscious projections taking corporeal form. Theyre terrifying. When Algren becomes their prisoner he gets to see the other side and thats really where the movie begins. From the cramped steamy streets of Tokyo were suddenly brought into a land of open spaces spacious ancient temples and houses with screens that let in the air and light. Algren can breathe - he can even sleep - and he begins to see a new way to live. This era in Japanese history the climactic confrontation between the old Shogunate and Western-looking modernists could have been told in a different way. It might have been as the story of a great people escaping the grip of medievalism and taking their rightful place among the nations of the world. But thats not the point of view at work here. The samurai are portrayed as disciplined and wise and Zwick pans over the pagodas blending into the natural landscape as though he were already lamenting their loss -- and the Wal-Mart that might be there now. Ken Watanabe brings a calm power to his role as Katsumoto the samurai leader as well as a magnetism that allows him to hold the screen with Cruise. He may seem a bit too reasonable and affable for a real-life samurai chief - or even a samurai chief in a Kurosawa movie - but hes the samurai this movie needs. That Watanabe survives scenes in which the great leader does little but nod with wonder at Algrens wisdom is a measure of the actors innate dignity. Zwick takes his time lingering over Algrens bucolic idyll and delving into 19th century Japanese politics - the emperor here makes Joan of Arcs Dauphin look like George S. Patton. The pace might sag and the world-view feels naive but the energy never drops out. Two things keep driving ""The Last Samurai."" One is Cruises work ethic In a strenuous role he takes a pounding. The other is the filmmakers moral indignation at the predatory greed thats at the heart of so much human misery. What will they make of this movie in 20 years? Id love to know. Made at a time of global anxiety ""The Last Samurai"" is all about Americas fear of its own power.. Advisory This film contains graphic violence and mild language.

Thats as long as he doesnt try to do either of the two things that can make him look borderline silly. Director Edward Zwicks ponderous The Last Samurai compounds its dramatic defects by asking Cruise to do both in the same 21/2-hour picture. Tom Cruise wields several weapons in The Last Samurai. By David James Warner Bros. First it takes an actor with one of the screens most decidedly 20th-century personas and casts him as an ex-Indian fighter hired to train Japans imperial army in combat techniques modern to the storys 1876 setting. Then it ignores Cruises trademark (a kind of Gatorade get-up-and-go) to introduce him unconvincingly as a falling-down drunk. Not even in Born on the Fourth of July did we feel that Cruise was a total self-abuser or at least not for long. All this is crucial because in addition to being the movies only name actor (to Americans) Cruise has to carry the stodgy exposition on his shoulders before events get him out of San Francisco and into Yokohama. This notably handsome production gets marginally better as it goes specifically when it introduces the quietly dynamic leader of a remote samurai community (Ken Watanabe). But it never recovers from its failure to grip or engage in the early going. Watanabe plays Katsumoto a warrior who opposes the modernity Cruises Capt. Nathan Algren represents. Algrens appearance in Japan is a wind-shift promoted by the countrys young emperor. More about the movie The Last Samurai  stars out of four Stars Tom Cruise Ken Watanabe Billy Connolly Timothy Spall Tony Goldwyn Koyuki Director Edward Zwick Distributor Warner Bros. Rating R for strong violence and battle sequences But right away you start to wonder because Algren -- suddenly gone cold-turkey -- gets routed almost immediately with quickly assembled troops in a skirmish with the rebellious samurai. But instead of going back to the bottle he heals his physical/spiritual wounds in the mountains with the Katsumoto band which leads to a personal transformation. Its all so stolid and humorless even the scenes in San Francisco without compensating epic sweep. Any hints of a romance with Katsumotos widowed sister (beautiful one-name actress Koyuki) are just that. The movie is big on fleeting glances. No wonder then that Samurais one shot at saving itself is a climactic underdog battle (a Spartacus-or-Braveheart wannabe) pitting Algren who has now switched his alliance to the samurai against Japans new mechanized army. Just as the hapless Timeline comes to life momentarily once the arrows start to fly Samurais big set piece gives action audiences something though hardly enough to break the movie out of standard action spectacles from past decades. The marvelous John Toll (Bravehearts cinematographer) makes it all look resplendent but Toll got his first Oscar for shooting Zwicks Legends of the Fall which didnt exactly save that day. It will be fascinating to follow Samurais fortunes compared with those of Master and Commander The Far Side of the World an incomparably better movie. Both have one marquee star no romance and tough-sell subject matter to teens who like their movies to be set within the past five years and no more than 5 miles from the mall. If a miscast Cruise can successfully lug this one through the holiday season he really may be the last superstar. Copyright 2005 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Story Tools RELATED  CNN.com  Reviews archive YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Movies Tom Cruise or Create your own Manage alerts | What is this? (CNN) -- Tom Cruise is Hollywoods Golden Boy in more than one sense a bankable movie star who can guarantee a blockbuster hit even when the project is less than stellar. For a long time now hes cruised on his box office power with projects such as ""Eyes Wide Shut"" (1999) ""Vanilla Sky"" (2001) and ""Minority Report"" (2002) films in which he played Tom Cruise more than his character. None of these were great films but his marquee value saved the day and they all made millions. In the case of ""The Last Samurai"" he becomes an actor again. ""Samurai"" is a spectacular epic adventure and Cruise is stunning as Captain Nathan Algren a Union soldier from the Civil War who loses his soul on the battlefield and sells himself off to the Japanese Imperial Army as a mercenary. Now Cruise can act. A quick look at ""Rain Man"" (1988) and ""Born on the Fourth of July"" (1989) proves the point. But with ""The Last Samurai"" Cruise not only shows -- once again -- that he can really really act but this role actually demonstrates an enormous growth in his skills. Cruise becomes Nathan Algren more than he has ever inhabited a character before. Directed by Edward Zwick (1989s ""Glory"" and 1994s ""Legends of the Fall"") the action begins shortly after the American Civil War. At the same time Japan is shaking off thousands of years of deeply ingrained traditions and cultural isolationism. The emperor is determined to modernize his nation and needs a updated army to achieve that goal. Standing in his way is the ancient culture of the samurai and those warriors strict dedication to protecting their emperor -- and their way of life -- with traditional weapons of arrows and spears. Finding a cause Cruises character gets involved with the sister of a samurai. Shes played by the Japanese actress Koyuki. Economic trade with the West is about to open so the old ways are doomed. Katsumoto (played with great skill by veteran Japanese actor Ken Watanabe) the leader of the last of the samurai decides to take a final stand before the end of this chapter in Japans history. At this point Capt. Algren a borderline alcoholic arrives as part of a group of former American soldiers hired to transform Japans army into a modern-day fighting force complete with cannons Gatling guns rifles and pistols. Algren is a grim angry man with no illusions. After a horrifying ordeal in the Civil War and being forced to take part in hideous Indian massacres honor and country are meaningless words to him. He goes about training the Japanese soldiers on automatic pilot. Never again will his emotions become involved in any kind of cause -- noble or otherwise. Then his unprepared troops are suddenly called to duty. Algren knows his men are not ready but hes overruled. Reluctantly he leads his green soldiers into battle against the renegade samurai. The result is a slaughter and Algren -- much to his surprise -- is captured alive and taken prisoner. Katsumoto it seems saw him in battle and was impressed enough to spare his life while at the same time using Algren to practice his English skills and learn whatever he can about the enemy Algren represents. Slowly Algren begins to heal from his wounds and starts to observe the life around him. Hes living in a traditional samurai village where every man woman and child devotes every moment to the spiritual and physical demands of honoring and learning the art of a samurai. To Algrens dismay he discovers that the woman caring for him Taka (played by one of Japans best actresses Koyuki) is Katsumotos sister -- and was made a widow when Algren killed her husband in battle. The awakening of Algrens heart and soul and his renewed belief in honor and courage is beautifully realized by Cruises performance. The samurai way of life restores his faith in the human spirit and reminds him that sacrifice in the service of a noble moral code is still worth fighting for. Slowly Katsumoto and Algren build a bond based on mutual respect and a deep belief in Bushido the samurais code of honor -- a code that for Algren transcends culture. Love and war The battle scenes of ""The Last Samurai"" are brutal -- and beautiful says CNN critic Paul Clinton. Zwick and his co-producer and co-writer Marshall Herskovitz (screenplay credit also goes to John Logan) have created a beautiful film that combines terrifying battle sequences with a deeply moving love story. In fact theyve interwoven a number of love stories into this magnificent piece of work. There is the love between the two warriors Algren and Katsumoto who have bounded like brothers; the forbidden love that develops between Algren and Taka; and finally the doomed love these people have for a way of life destined to disappear under the relentless march of progress. All of this takes place on a canvas of great scope showing an entire culture -- and a way of life that had lasted for centuries -- undergoing a catastrophic change. This is a big movie with big themes and bigger-than-life characters. The battle scenes are not only spectacular they are also emotional. The men fight against all odds using arrows and spears against cannons and bullets all the while knowing their cause is doomed. ""The Last Samurai"" is spectacularly filmed by John Toll who won Academy Awards for both ""Legends of the Fall"" and ""Braveheart."" The production design by Lilly Kilvert feels utterly real and historically correct sweeping you into this expertly crafted period piece. This film has Oscar bait written all over it. You will be seeing ""The Last Samurai"" vying for all the top categories come Academy Award night. ""The Last Samurai"" opens nationwide on Friday December 5 and its rated R. The film was produced by Warner Bros. a division of Time Warner as is CNN.

"Last Samurai The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; last-samurai-the ) Last Samurai The (United States/New Zealand/Japan 2003) A movie review by James Berardinelli Its a genuine pleasure to come across a motion picture like The Last Samurai - a rousing tale that combines high adventure with emotional effectiveness. This movie works because it never loses sight of the characters no matter how epic the scope becomes. With its grand sweeping battle sequences lush cinematography and gripping storyline The Last Samurai already has a spot reserved on my end-of-the-year Top 10 list. In one category or another it is also likely to catch the Academys interest this winter. Director Edward Zwick may be one of the most underrated filmmakers currently working within the Hollywood system. Over the course of a roughly two-decade career he has helmed a masterpiece (Glory) and two near-masterpieces (Courage Under Fire and this one) as well as several lesser but still compelling movies. Zwick has also been a big name in television sharing responsibility with his producing partner Marshall Herskovitz for the critically-acclaimed series ""thirtysomething"" and ""Once and Again."" That kind of resume alone makes one optimistic about any project with which Zwick has involvement. The Last Samurai opens in 1876 San Francisco where Civil War hero Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is drowning his sorrows in booze. A warrior without a war to fight Nathan spends his time shilling for a rifle company making live appearances that pay him enough to afford his drink. That all changes when a delegation arrives from Japan seeking to hire American army ""heroes"" to teach modern warfare to the Emperors forces. A band of rebels led by the samurai Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) is threatening to derail a cross-country railroad being built by the Japanese government so troops are needed to intervene. When offered an obscene amount of money for his aid Nathan cannot refuse so he joins his good friend Sgt. Zebulah Grant (Billy Connolly) and his former commander (with whom he has ""issues"") Col. Benjamin Bagly (Tony Goldwyn) on the trip to Japan. As he writes in his diary referring to the days when he and Bagly slaughtered Indians ""I am hired to once again stop the rebellion of another tribal leader - apparently the only job for which I am qualified."" Once in Japan Nathan wastes no time teaching the art of firing rifles to his sad group of conscripts but when they are prematurely forced to face Katsumoto they are unprepared. The engagement is a rout and Nathan is captured. Through the long winter of 1876 and into the spring of 1877 he is held captive in Katsumotos mountain settlement. During that time he engages in many conversations with the samurai leader who is attempting to master English. He learns about the samurai way of life develops an attraction to Katsumotos sister Taka (Koyuki) and improves his fighting skills. When ninjas attack he battles alongside the samurai to defend the village. Thereafter he is seen as an equal and no longer a captive. But a hard decision lies ahead - return to Tokyo and resume his commission or side with Katsumoto and face almost certain death. The Last Samurai is singularly effective in bridging the gap between today and the 1870s. We are transported back through time more than a century and half-way across the globe. Zwick overcomes the language barrier by having Katsumoto be a student of English (that way everything doesnt have to be subtitled). The battle sequences are frank and brutal with none of the artistry and grace of many recent swordfighting movies. The Last Samurai is about heroes of a different sort. Zwicks influences are numerous and readily apparent. To one degree or another he has borrowed from his own Glory Mel Gibsons Braveheart and the TV mini-series based on James Clavells Shogun. But the most obvious homage is to the work of Akira Kurosawa the great Japanese filmmaker who established his international reputation with movies about samurai and ronin. Kurosawas Rashomon proved to be an influence for Zwicks Courage Under Fire. Here the connection is more broad-based with Ran and Seven Samurai particularly coming to mind. Had The Last Samurai been filmed four decades ago one could easily see Kurosawa making it with the legendary Toshiro Mifune as Katsumoto. In what should be seen as the ultimate compliment Ken Watanabe (virtually unknown in the West) channels Mifune so forcefully that its hard to envision anyone doing a better job as Katsumoto. Watanabe brings to the fore everything we expect to see in a great leader strength courage patience the ability to dominate a fight and above all honor. Tom Cruise may be The Last Samurais undisputed star but Watanabes performance is more memorable and more persuasive. Its not that Cruise does a bad job - he is a good enough actor to make us believe in Nathan - but Watanabes work dominates. Strong support is provided by both English-speaking and Japanese actors. The lovely Koyuki plays Nathans love interest; Hiroyuki Sanada is a fierce warrior who disagrees with Katsumotos decision to keep the American alive; Timothy Spall is a British photojournalist; and Tony Goldwyn portrays Bagly with oily precision. The movies title foreshadows a tragic denouement but that in no way lessens The Last Samurais impact. The film is in many ways about the clash between the old ways (those of the samurai) and the new (those employed by the American-trained troops). While history makes the results predictable (six decades later a thoroughly modern Japan would attack Pearl Harbor) its our involvement with the characters and their situations that energizes the experience of sitting through this movie. The historical context may be established but we dont know what happens to Nathan Katsumoto Taka and others. There is of course something exceptionally dramatic about stories in which a grossly outnumbered group puts up a valiant albeit ultimately doomed defense. Thats the reason why historical battles like the Alamo and Thermopylae (which is explicitly referenced in The Last Samurai) have become legendary and why films like Braveheart are so well-received. This element gives The Last Samurai much of its power and passion. It is in the grand storytelling tradition of the underdog achieving glory. Shot by veteran cinematographer John Toll (who also photographed Braveheart and Zwicks own Legends of the Fall) The Last Samurai is never anything but amazing to look at. Since the dialogue is limited (a necessity because of the language gap) images gain additional importance. The battle sequences in particular are effectively captured and the editor (Steven Rosenblum) does not reduce them to the level of incoherence by employing too many cuts. Hans Zimmers score enhances the mood without becoming overbearing. The Last Samurai earns every minute of its near two-and-one-half hour running length. Theres no fat to trim and no sense that scenes have been included to pad the ego of the director and/or his star. The Last Samurai is 144 minutes of pure story - the kind of powerful mix of epic battle and human interest that so rarely shows up on movie screens these days.

Posted November 27 2003 -- 1200 AM EST In The Last Samurai Tom Cruise plays Tom Cruise playing a Civil War captain who moves to 19th-century Japan where he learns to play a samurai warrior. Not that theres anything wrong with Cruise playing Cruise; its what he famously does with glittering intensity. And when hes well matched with a role that plays off his lustrous opaque core as in ""Jerry Maguire"" or ""Minority Report"" Cruise is a pulsar of gorgeous distant luminosity. But lets be clear The star of Edward Zwicks rousing smoothly assembled historical fantasia is no samurai nor a Civil War captain either no matter how studiously the actor has applied himself to mastering the arcane techniques of martial arts. The galactic opposite of Russell Crowe (a huge star who eclipses his public persona to become each character) Cruise turns Capt. Nathan Algren into an approximation a model an avatar of a Western-born Eastern-trained warrior. In a moment of loudly telegraphed cultural adjustment Algren - who has been hired to teach Japanese conscripts how to fight in the ""modern"" style with impersonal Western weapons and conventional battle plans - exchanges his dirty showy officers uniform for a clean simple Japanese robe and for the first time comprehends the elegant humility of padding barefoot in a spotless house. And an audiences first spontaneous response is Doesnt Tom Cruise look handsome in a long dress He does of course. And ""The Last Samurai"" is a handsome epic a brave-hearted 19th-century man-saga from the director who made the period piece man-sagas ""Glory"" and ""Legends of the Fall."" (Honorable confession I wept great ploppy tears during the fabulous battle scenes shot by that master of scope swell and ""The Thin Red Line"" cinematographer John Toll.) In the movie Algren is an embittered Civil War hero disillusioned by the killing he has seen and in which he himself has participated; hes gone to seed. The Japanese job offers even more money he can blow on drink this time in an exotic country where old ways and old concepts of honor and personal responsibility are being destroyed by technological and cultural ""progress"" The countrys susceptible young emperor (Kabuki star Shichinosuke Nakamura) wooed by American tycoons with propositions for a lucrative future of trade not only accepts American help in shaping up a modern army but also agrees with his advisers to get rid of the tradition-bound caste of samurai who have protected Japans emperors for centuries. So Algren growls his way to the mysterious East. And there his system of beliefs - really of disbeliefs - is challenged by the true warriors he meets led by a charismatic leader Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) the last of his breed. Because Watanabe is a well-known Japanese TV star but unknown in the U.S. I have no way of knowing whether the actor playing Katsumoto has indeed obscured himself in the armor of an esteemed fighter or whether to his fans he just looks like Ken Watanabe in samurai drag. But we do know that hes magnetic and majestic-looking capable of simultaneously projecting a fierce courage and a poetry-loving heart. (In certain lights hes also capable of looking like The Rock.) And that when Algren is captured by Katsumoto after a skirmish in which the two men recognize a certain temperamental affinity Watanabe effortlessly lays claim to the acting honors in this ""Last Samurai"" show. Moved by the serenity of his new environment not to mention by the liquid grace of Katsumotos sister Taka (Koyuki) Algren comes to love his enemies and fight for them. Moved by commitment to the inner search for manly authenticity Zwick working from a baggy script he cowrote with Marshall Herskovitz and John Logan (""Gladiator"") establishes a fond feel for archaic society - and a Hollywood warriors weakness for succumbing to pop conventions (in the Algren-and- Taka subplot for instance or in the Hollywood-star-style ingratiating coda) where his idol of the genre Akira Kurosawa would not. ""No disrespect intended sir but shove it up your ass"" is one of Algrens more 20th-century less haiku-style utterances before he meets Katsumoto and hears his wise counterpart admire a cherry blossom and pronounce ""Know life in every breath."" As he undergoes conversion Algren marvels at his new friends who ""devote themselves to the perfection of whatever they pursue."" Cruise pursues perfection too plying his craft as if on a celebrity mission. Its monkish work and doesnt invite closeness but it commands respect in actors or in samurai.
