Call it The Tarantino Effect or Peter Jacksons Syndrome as soon as a struggling director gets a whiff of success they splurge out on that lavish long-cherished personal project be it ice-skating gorillas or an entire afternoons worth of Uma Thurman in a yellow jumpsuit. Judd Apatow deserves his bite at the cherry The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up sparked a revolution in American comedy bringing charm insight and fun back to a genre dominated by joyless fratboy antics. But were audiences really clamouring for a two-and-a-half hour Adam Sandler movie?In Funny People Sandler is front and centre (isnt he always?) as George Simmons a legend of stand-up gone to seed in a succession of mainstream money-spinners. Diagnosed with a fatal blood disorder he hires budding comic Ira Wright (Seth Rogen) as his assistant and tries to work out where his life went off the rails. Theres much more to Funny People than a brief synopsis can contain including a great deal of soul-searching and self-exploration as well as righteous gags and celebrity cameos (Eminem Sarah Silverman James Taylor?). And thats the problem theres too much here for one movie. Apatows plotting so streamlined in the past has become flabby and undisciplined as what seems to be a straightforward tale of mortality and redemption gradually becomes bogged down by unnecessary characters and outright schmaltz staggering to an unsatisfying conclusion. This is a generous goodhearted enjoyable movie loaded with memorable characters and genuine wit. But theres such a thing as giving a little too much.Click here to read an interview with Apatow......and read Time Outs list of the greatest cinematic stand-ups By Tom Huddleston Posted Tuesday August 25 2009 Details Release details Rated 15 Release date Friday August 28 2009 Duration 146 mins Cast and crew Director Judd Apatow Screenwriter Judd Apatow Cast Adam SandlerSeth RogenLeslie MannEric BanaJonah HillJason SchwartzmanAubrey PlazaMaude ApatowIris Apatow RZAAziz Ansari Users say (7) 3 out of 5 stars Average User Rating2.8 / 5Rating Breakdown5 star14 star13 star02 star21 star0LiveReviews|71 person listeningSign inWrite reviewMost helpfulMost helpfulHighest ratingLowest ratingNewestOldestLoadingundefinedNew CommentsRefreshSep 24 2009EmilyFeaturedrubbish far too long and not enough comedyFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 20 2009SylvanderFeaturedIf you thought this movie was funny you ought to get out more. There is a little scene in it that sums up the entire movie for the 100 strong audience when I saw it in Aberdeen. A dvd of a ten year old girl singing ""memories"" is played. The effect was cringemaking. Apatow could have cut a half hout out of this work and it would make more sense and be less of a cure for Insomnia.

Comments (3) click to enlarge Funny People Recommended Video Rated R  2009 Judd Apatow (Knocked Up The 40-Year-Old Virgin) takes some interesting chances in this messy but engaging comedy which suggests he may yet mature (no seriously) into a filmmaker of substance. Adam Sandler punches way above his accustomed weight as an Adam Sandler-esque comedian whos gotten mega-rich making terrible Adam Sandler-esque movies. Isolated by stardom and diagnosed with advanced leukemia he hires schlubby struggling stand-up Seth Rogen as his personal assistant then enlists the horrified Rogen in a sordid scheme to win back his lost love (Leslie Mann) from her macho but New Agey Australian husband (Eric Bana). At 150 minutes this is too long but the characters are well-rounded and the dick jokes border on poetry. The best laughs come from Jonah Hill (Superbad) and Jason Schwartzman (Rushmore) as Rogens seethingly competitive comedian roommates. R.

July 31 2009 -- 217pm Photo Credit Tracy Bennett/univ Photo provided Funny People Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint The maturing of Judd Apatow is sort of a shame. First he gave us ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" a bubbly dudecom about getting lucky then ""Knocked Up"" a cheeky affecting charmer about the business of forming families and birthing babies. His third film as a writer/director ""Funny People"" concerns loneliness illness and infidelity. Clocking in at 2 1/2 hours its a throwback to the smiling-through-tears midlife dramedies James L. Brooks made in bygone years. Its ""Terms of Endearment"" with dirtier jokes. The laughs get bogged down in drama and self-analysis. The story is set among Hollywoods subculture of professional comedians whose love affair with rooms full of strangers masks impenetrable isolation. The film opens with home video recordings of a 20-year-old Adam Sandler sending his roommates into convulsions while making prank phone calls (Apatow and Sandler shared an apartment back in the lean days). Cut to the present and we meet Sandlers character comedy legend George Simmons wearily padding through his empty Malibu mansion. Simmons is Sandlers sourpuss alter ego a star of high-concept low-IQ hits such as ""Merman"" and ""My Best Friend Is a Robot."" Fattened a bit by fame but not mellowed by it he looks unwell. When his doctor tells him that he has aggressive leukemia he has no one to tell so he hits the stage at the local stand-up club. ""Whos going to amuse you when Im gone?"" he asks the puzzled audience. Fledgling comic Ira Wright (Seth Rogen) razzes Georges oddball performance in his own act. George likes what he sees and hires Ira to be his co-writer flunky and buddy-substitute. George has plenty of acquaintances but as he puts it ""Andy Dick is not a friend."" Ira is thrilled to be Georges sidekick; as they drive in his limousine Ira hangs his face out the window and grins like a blissed-out Saint Bernard. But as George begins to confide in Ira he comes to realize that the world-famous funnyman can be as cruel and callous as he is generous. George reacts to his German physician in true form for a comic ribbing him about his resemblance to ""Die Hard"" villains. Ira joins in and by the time theyre done the well-meaning doctor is visibly justifiably bothered. Ira learns life lessons from these encounters while his prickly mentor learns nothing. George offers a pat on the back and a knife in the ribs in a single sentence ""Youre my only friend"" he tells Ira ""and I dont even like you."" The central trauma of Georges life (prior to his illness) is lack of affection. Hes cut off from his family and he lost the love of the love of his life Laura (Leslie Mann Mrs. Apatow). George contacts her to apologize for cheating then decides they might reconcile. The fact that she has a husband (Eric Bana) and two children doesnt matter much to him. He barges into their home while the husband is away and upsets the domestic applecart as Ira looks on in helpless nausea. The final third of the film sets the hoary Dying Man Learns What It Means To Live template on its head. But its not much fun to watch this over- entitled narcissist damage a solid family because its ""my turn to be happy."" ""Funny People"" has its moments to be sure. Rogen is instantly likable as softhearted Ira and when he gives his boss an overdue denunciation hes briefly heroic. Sandler is up to the demands of a difficult role that ricochets from goony humor to painful self-analysis. The film is spot-on about the psychic kinks that compel many comedians to hit the stage and ruthlessly honest about the kind of hack material that all too many audiences will cheer. Aziz Ansaris cameo as a cocky talentless stand-up the snippets of George Simmons films that we see and the NBC sitcom ""Yo Teach"" starring Iras actor roommate are witheringly accurate satire of pop mediocrity. FUNNY PEOPLE  OUT OF FOUR STARS Rating R for language and crude sexual humor throughout and some sexuality. Its great that Apatow aimed for something more substantial than a disposable chucklefest. Too bad the film falls so short of the mark.

Yet in going for a rethink of ""All That Jazz"" with comedy instead of Broadway Judd Apatows ""Funny People"" turns out to be one of the most absorbing films of the year. Plus it has lots of wiener jokes. MOVIE BLOG Sandler and Apatow Facing Trial by Twitterati Comic actor George Simmons (Adam Sandler) has made millions doing crap comedy but doesnt feel good about his life. Or his death which is approaching quickly thanks to a blood ailment. (Its technical term is OMD or Only in Movie Disease the kind where you dont have to spend time in bed or lose weight. You get some dark eye shadow though.) Apatow the writer-director of ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"" starts with a camcorder snippet he took nearly 20 years ago of his then-roommate Adam Sandler making prank calls in a prison-bare apartment. A third roommate another comic isnt famous. Thats part of what ""Funny People"" is about. Apatow and Sandlers experience gives the movie its foundation. Ira (Seth Rogen) works at a deli and does stand-up on the side. One roommate (Jonah Hill) is another flailing comic. But the third (Jason Schwartzman) has mysteriously hit it big on a ""Saved by the Bell""-ish sitcom. Now he litters the apartment with his 25000 paychecks and warns of a girl Ira likes that hell sleep with her in 10 days if Ira doesnt. (By the way remember this actress name Aubrey Plaza. Shes awesome.) George (who is working pretty hard for a dying guy) stops by the comedy club where Ira performs to do a set likes the way Ira mocks him and hires him to write jokes. Since George has no friends Ira becomes his only confidante. There are benefits ""You want to f - - - these two girls?"" George asks of a pair of beauties he hasnt met and then proceeds to bonk both of them. Like magicians comics go quiet when it comes to how the game works but the profession has strange corners and weird vibes that Apatow explores with wit and honesty. Comics dont naturally laugh (they say ""Thats funny"" instead). They use funny as a club (both in the sense of a weapon used to beat down the uncool and in the sense of a private group that keeps out others -- especially women). They get rich doing comedy that isnt funny. That George and Ira could bond instantly is a little unbelievable (""Its good to be excited"" George tells his new assistant. ""I used to be excited."") but so are a lot of things in comedyworld. Like why does Andy Dick have a career? And whats he doing in this movie? Somewhere in the celebrity fog George finds himself talking to the biggest star in music -- a summit that reduces even Ray Romano to a looky-loo. Sandler is close to perfect as the kind of performer who is loved by millions and liked by no one. His ex (an adorable Leslie Mann) believes hes become a better person since he got sick. Has he? Whether we like this guy is beside the point but he remains so guarded that Apatow never quite solves the problem of who comedians really are. Granted it may be as unsolvable as health care. And after 21/2 hours you need a great ending. Apatow doesnt have one. Still Apatow has reached the place where they let you make the film you actually want to make and hes earned it. If he hasnt quite reached Woody Allens peak of comic melancholy who has? kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next KARA DIOGUARDI IDOL RETURN OFFICIAL Read Next KARA DIOGUARDI IDOL RETURN OFFICIAL Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 17854 How Hillary blew her big moment 10583 Malia Obama skipped the DNC for Lollapalooza 7306 NYC tourist duped into buying 1M worth of fake jewelry Now On Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary Jill and Joe Biden stop traffic on Fifth Avenue SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

The movie is called ""Funny People."" Funny doesnt always mean smart but this is the work of a couple of very smart comedians. One of them is Judd Apatow the one-time TV writer who is pretty much his own studio these days with a hand in comedies from ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" to ""Superbad"" and an eye for new talent that has produced a stable of discoveries. Funny People (R) Universal (140 min.) Directed by Judd Apatow. With Adam Sandler Seth Rogen Leslie Mann. Now playing in New Jersey. Stephen Whittys rating THREE AND A HALF STARS Rating note The film contains non-stop profanity nudity sexual situations and comic violence. The other one is -- I have to admit it -- Adam Sandler. I almost hate to admit it too because Sandler is one comic Ive never gotten. When he was on ""Saturday Night Live"" he used to laugh at his own jokes; when he went into movies he specialized in playing angry adenoidal babies. I couldnt stand him. But Sandler did to his credit -- and unlike plenty of other comics -- occasionally seek out real directors and real challenges. ""Punch Drunk Love"" was a stretch. ""Spanglish"" was another. They showed a willingness to try new things even if neither completely worked. ""Funny People"" works. It also suggests that Sandler didnt find most of his other movies very funny either. This time around he plays a former stand-up comic whos made his fortune making idiotic comedies playing characters who turn into babies or mermaids. He hates his fans. He has no friends. And then he gets cancer. Boy the laughs just keep coming dont they? The funny thing is though that ""Funny People"" is well funny. Its also richly layered with complicated people and a mad collection of celebrity cameos from Eminem to Andy Dick. (And because this is a Judd Apatow movie dirty gags. Lots of dirty gags.) The movie begins with Sandlers charater George Simmons suddenly becoming the punch line in his own bad joke. (Doctor I think youre going to die. Patient Can I get a second opinion? Doctor Okay I think youre a jerk too.) So he decides to spend his remaining time doing the club dates he used to love. Hes out of practice though and out of material. So George hires a struggling would-be comic as his uncredited joke writer and all-around flunky. And since Ira Wrights (Seth Rogen) only other paying job at the time is dishing up potato salad at the deli counter he grabs it. You can predict where the film will go at this point Ira will learn that his idol isnt a very nice person and George will learn a little humility and humanity from this naif. And the film does indeed go there. But first it goes in other interesting places. Ira it turns out is just as hungry and manipulative as anyone else in Hollywood. And even as George tries some before-its-too-late apologies he still manages to screw things up by rekindling an old romance with Laura (the delightful Leslie Mann Apatows real-life wife) which only complicates matters for everyone. Things eventually sort themselves out and as always Apatow is in no hurry to tie up the loose ends; like most of his movies this one clocks in at well over two hours. Yet unlike those other pictures it doesnt feel as if it were made in the editing room; theres a discipline to the structure and the way the gags build. There isnt much Id want to sacrifice. The liquid-eyed Jason Schwartzman -- a genius at self-mocking sensitivity -- is wickedly funny as a tiny talentless TV star. Aubrey Plaza has a nice deadpan turn as another struggling stand-up. Apatow gets the whole Young Hollywood Hip-ocracy -- I love you dude but stay outta my spotlight -- perfectly. And then theres Sandler. Hes stripped away his old disguises -- the look-at-me mannerisms the little-boy sad-sack self-pity. Instead theres a new kind of honesty in his performance mostly in his characters self-deception and how angry and unpleasant he really is at heart. But then perhaps a smile is only a way we hide a snarl; perhaps comedy has always been aggression by other means. ""That joke killed."" ""I murdered that audience."" The language of stand-up is the language of the battlefield and sometimes the first casualty carried off is the comic. But that doesnt stop the real ones from charging back for the next nights battle competing desperately to win respect from people whose opinion they dont much value trying to turn the pain and embarrassment of failure into yet another joke. Strange people I know. But theyre funny that way. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

Michael Posner From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Thursday Jul. 30 2009 447PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 319PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Funny People Written and directed by Judd Apatow Starring Adam Sandler Seth Rogen and Leslie Mann Classification 14A Its just a hunch but Id be willing to bet that audiences are going to be shocked at just how unfunny Funny People is. After two blockbuster hits ( The 40-year-old Virgin and Knocked Up ) Judd Apatow the newly minted King of Hollywood comedy has delivered a vastly more ambitious work. Its at once dark and sentimental and (at 146 minutes) hugely indulgent - both of himself and of the tiresome troupe of actors he works with post-adolescents for whom penis jokes have come to constitute a form of breathing. And heres my subversive thesis Apatow wants us to see not just what miserable human beings these comics are and how deeply unhappy they can be - we all know that already - but how essentially unfunny they are as well; how tasteless and puerile. Some part of him cant quite believe that he and his friends earn absurd amounts of money for being as offensive as possible and calling it humour. Imagine he seems to be saying being paid millions of dollars merely for talking about masturbation and hairy testicles. The films chief exemplar of infantilism is George Simmons (Adam Sandler) a 40-year-old Croesus of comedy. Like many of Apatows own friends George has long since made the segue from stand-up to movies starring in films that in case we might miss the point underscore his severe case of arrested development Re-Do  for instance in which he plays a diapered baby with a mans face and MerMan  in which he is half man half fish. George displays all the trappings of excess a gorgeous Los Angeles estate a garage full of surplus flat-screen TVs expensive cars. He has servants but no real friends sleeps casually with groupies and mourns the loss of his one true love Laura (Leslie Mann Apatows real-life wife) who left him 12 years ago for cheating on her. You could drive an SUV through the hole in the mans soulless self-hating heart. But early on George gets grim medical news Hes dying of leukemia and the odds of an experimental treatment working are eight in 100. Seeking solace in his old milieu of stand-up he returns to the stage with a flat self-pitying act and there befriends Ira Wright (a slimmed-down Seth Rogen) a young aspiring comic working in a shopping mall deli. Soon George has retained Ira as his live-in bad-joke writer opening act and all-purpose facilitator. The pair of course are aspects of Apatow himself the 20-year-old struggling stand-up comedian he once was rooming with other victims of suspended adolescence and what he fears he could too easily become - the same man 20 years later sated with riches but estranged from family and friends as selfish and loathsome a creature as one might conceive. And thus George embarks in a dragging plot line on a quixotic campaign to reconnect with his lost love Laura now a mother of two precocious daughters (Apatows real-life kids Maude and Iris) and married to Clarke a rugged Australian businessman (Eric Bana easily the best actor on the screen). When Bana returns unexpectedly from an Asian business trip to find his wife making cozy with the old flame chaos ensues. At one point were even forced to watch a home movie of one of Apatows daughters singing in a school performance of Cats . George self-absorbed as always fiddles with his cellphone completely bored. By that time so was I. Sandler mopes through the movie like a dead man walking most alive when he reverts to his standbys silly falsetto voices and foreign accents. Nevertheless there are a few redemptive moments when he shows signs of the fine actor he can be ( Punch-Drunk Love ) tapping the deep reservoir of emotion buried within. As for Rogen he wasnt particularly funny when he had his old paunch and now that hes svelte hes even less amusing He plays Ira as one part wide-eyed innocent and one part conniving opportunist stealing the very jokes he writes for George and refusing to cut his unfunny comedian roommates (Jonah Hill and Jason Schwartzman) in on the action. On the evidence at hand Judd Apatow doesnt want to be known only for cheap comedies such as Knocked Up  however funny and successful they might have been. He wants to be taken seriously. Funny People is the attempt to raise his game a notch - and it fails.

Media San Francisco Chronicle Funny People Comedy-drama. Starring Adam Sandler Seth Rogen Leslie Mann and Eric Bana. Directed by Judd Apatow. (R. 146 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) These are good days for screen comedy - enjoy them while they last. Filmmakers are trying new things breaking with formula and putting the emphasis on honesty whether it leads them into extreme harsh humor or into areas that mix comedy with drama. At the head of the innovators is Judd Apatow who despite the success of ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"" continues to push the definition of what a Judd Apatow movie is - and what a comedy can be - in his latest ""Funny People."" ""Funny People"" is a true brass ring effort a reach for excellence that takes big risks. Its 146 minutes with a story thats more European in feeling than American. Its not tightly structured but concentrates on the characters and their lives. There are no comic set pieces and the personalities arent exaggerated. Virtually every laugh comes simply from people saying funny things that they know are funny. And then theres the story the biggest risk of all about a major screen comedian (Adam Sandler) who finds out that he has a rare blood disease with a grim prognosis. But dont let this stop you. ""Funny People"" is anything but morbid and theres nothing maudlin or laugh-clown-laugh about it.

He throws an aspiring comedian Ira (Seth Rogen) into the orbit of megastar George Simmons (Sandler) as his personal assistant. Through Ira the audience gets a privileged glimpse into the world of grand-scale fame. Special treatment On the plus side George rides in limousines flies in private jets and can have anything he wants including just about his pick of women (or at least of women who arent famous). On the downside the fame is isolating. He has lost the friends he knew before he was famous and everyone he has met since cant respond to him as a human being. Plus by now hes spoiled and doesnt respond well to being treated like anybody else. The ugliness the burden and the contradictions of celebrity are captured in Sandlers performance. He understands the psychological nuances - why George for example has to hold himself at a remove from people to keep them from gushing but also to resist the temptation to be mean to them. Sandler also understands the empty camaraderie that exists between fellow celebrities (he has a very funny scene with Eminem and Ray Romano) as well as the demands of public life. Throughout he makes us feel Georges entrapment the awfulness of being stuck inside a sick body and in a world in which no display of weakness is allowed. Its the best work Sandler has done. ""Funny People"" introduces us into the professional culture of comedians how they work act talk and think. (They dont laugh when theyre told a joke. They say ""OK thats funny."") Apatow shows us bad stand-up mediocre stand-up and other stand-up that isnt good yet but could be. Almost in passing ""Funny People"" satirizes bad TV sitcoms and pathetic formula comedies Among Georges credits are ""Mer-man"" and ""My Best Friend Is a Robot"" in which he is supposed to have co-starred with Owen Wilson. Serious at heart But despite the laughs the movie is at heart serious. Rogen is subtle and effective as a young comic whose ambition is tempered by a fundamental decency. And Leslie Mann is lovely in a straight emotional role as the ex-girlfriend George most values if only because she loved him before he was anybody. Apatow takes no shortcuts in his characterizations. A TV sitcom star (Jason Schwartzman) who is partly shallow and self-satisfied is not really a bad young guy after all. And Eric Bana as Manns husband is a complex figure on the surface just a slick businessman but one who is on a genuine spiritual journey. Apatow is not afraid of his characters being like real people or of his stories finding their way to their own truth. With his first two movies but especially with ""Funny People"" Apatow is showing that truth is not the enemy of comedy but its wellspring and its ideal destination. -- Advisory This film contains sexual situations strong language and multiple jokes about the male member.

And in the minutes following Georges hard diagnosis writer/director Judd Apatow and ace cinematographer Janusz Kaminski deliver some beautifully somber images that capture the lonesomeness of certain kinds of bad news. As George Adam Sandler looks submerged in a roiling eddy we can only guess at. Before meeting with his doctor he gabbed with fans posed for goofball pictures. Now hes in a daze submitting to another photo op with a smiling fan. You almost feel for the guy. Almost. Sandler does deft work as a character whose flashes of generosity are undone by persistent selfishness. ""Funny People"" is a thoughtful (if at times self-serving) movie about comedy celebrity and the toll they take on comics who are -- but also arent -- mere mortals. Its a morality tale that uses a mortality setup. What happens when a funny guy stands on the brink? And what does he learn as he takes a step back from that long drop? Is it funny? Yes. Is it riotous ribald yet empty? Absolutely not. Faced with death George returns to stand-up comedy like a wounded homing pigeon. Comics like Jerry Seinfeld and Dave Chappelle often celebrate the intimacy and immediate gratification -- or on a bad night mortification -- of plying their material in front of a comedy-club audience. This movie pays homage to that tango of killing em or getting the death-knell treatment. At the Improv club George meets Ira Wright. Apatows go-to guy Seth Rogen plays the aspiring funny guy who becomes confidant personal assistant and joke writer. Money status and maintaining relationships are themes. Where for instance does this arrangement fall on the spectrum of friendship? Jonah Hill and Jason Schwartzman play Iras roommates Leo and Mark. Tensions mount in their apartment as the three try to make their way in the laff biz. Leos gifted. Mark has success as the lead on a ""Welcome Back Kotter"" knockoff called ""Yo Teach."" Ira is not immune to competition. Hes not as fine a joke writer as Leo. He has a slow- moving crush on neighbor Daisy (Aubrey Plaza) that Mark might not honor. Leslie Mann plays Georges one-time girlfriend Laura. Shes the ""one that got away."" And for much of the movie shes pretty much out of sight out of mind. Shes married to Clarke an Aussie overplayed with some glee by Eric Bana and has kids. When she returns she brings a third act thats about romantic confusion clarity and the futility of tying lose ends. Mann and Apatow are hitched in real life and their lovely daughters Iris and Maude are cast as Lauras believably aware kids. Apatow knows that beyond the broad gestures and blue language of the comedies hes directed lie some solid truths and some pain. ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"" were rife with achy moments. At the hospital Iras and Georges banter at the expense of the Swedish doctor (Torsten Voges) is hilarious. But it is also self-defensive posturing. If you harbor doubts about Freuds declaration that jokes are aggression and revelation listen to the contemptuous ballad George sings at the Improv. Apatow continues to celebrate comedys traditions raunchy and otherwise. The apartment where Ira lives is a museum of comedy history. George has a telling talk with his dad about the greatness of Jackie Gleason. And a number of comics Sarah Silverman George Wallace and Ray Romano among them appear as themselves. (Though the movie teases notions of what that means exactly.) At a MySpace shindig Ira asks James Taylor if he ever tires of singing his songbook. Taylors retort is priceless and pointed and poses what some in the audience might feel is a self-abusing obsession with the male appendage. Apatow doesnt have as many words for penis as there are for snow. But what he lacks in variety he makes up for in sheer quantity.

A schlub gets drunk and impregnates a woman he just met. The two films that Judd Apatow has written and directed not including the 493 (actually seven) other comedies he has produced in the past two years are relationship pictures. The dialogue may be raunchy the subsidiary characters beyond rude but at the movies core Apatow wants you to know theres a real beating borderline-mushy heart. (Judd Apatow TIME 100 Finalist.) That heart comes bursting out of Funny People Apatows intermittently engaging 2 hr. 26 min. essay in schizo-cinemaphrenia. A transparent attempt to make a grown-up film its got two worldviews -- one comically misanthropic the other sloppily sentimental -- that have little in common with each other. Its as if halfway through you went out for popcorn and mistakenly returned to an auditorium showing a different picture. And that second movie ends immolating itself. (Joel Stein on Judd Apatow Judd Seriously.) Apatow casts his long-ago roommate Adam Sandler as George Simmons a star of movie comedies who has been diagnosed with a terminal disease and who hires Ira Wright (Seth Rogen) a struggling young comedian as his assistant. In what he presumes to be his last days George realizes hes essentially friendless and loveless and tries to rekindle the old affair with Laura (Leslie Mann) then a young actress now a wife and mother. On its surface Funny People is about stand-up comedians who have a love-hate obsession with their penises. In the movies many stand-up routines Apatow surely breaks the feature-film record for dick jokes including one told by Andy Dick. It ought to be called Funny Penises. Yet Apatow is much less interested in showing sex than in having people talk about it. George has plenty of one-night stands but mainly as an exercise of his star power. For all the girls he takes home and beds hes essentially alone -- the proverbial celebrity who finds it lonely at the top and who is wary of any new person who wants in including Ira (whom Rogen invests with a cuddly-toy irresistibility). ""Youre not my friend"" he tells Ira. ""You work for me."" George wants a last chance at human connection in the person of Laura. And thats where Funny People spins off the rails. (See TIMEs photos ""Judd Apatows War on Jay Leno."") Its said that inside every comedian is the urge to play Hamlet. (Hey Mel Gibson did it.) Well inside Judd Apatow he wishes is a secret Jim Brooks. James L. Brooks is the sitcom titan (Mary Tyler Moore Taxi The Simpsons) who forged an Oscar-winning film career as the writer-director of comedy-dramas about attractive neurotics. The needy souls from Terms of Endearment Broadcast News Ill Do Anything and As Good As It Gets were all variously self-aware and self-absorbed and they struck viewers not as comic constructs but as real flawed people -- who on the side were funny. Brooks is the secret touchstone of Funny People; indeed its two-part structure is Terms of Endearment in reverse with the deadly disease coming before the lovey stuff. (Sandler even did a Jim Brooks film; unfortunately it was that rare Brooks misfire Spanglish.) And where Brooks stories are usually about the fine line of ethics in human relationships -- does a newsman fake a tear in an interview? Does a production assistant lie about her boyfriend to her producer? -- this one is about whether a man who says he needs love really deserves it. And (POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT) the big ethical question is whether a hardened comedian will get all teary when he sees a 10-year-old dressed as Grizabella and singing ""Memory"" from Cats. Its a heavy dollop of sentiment that will baffle both Apatows fan base and those who watched the first half of the movie. Isnt this picture about whether George and Ira will become friends? Isnt there a guy-comedy rule that theres no crying in bromances? And isnt Cats the most derided popular musical in Broadway history? You may recall that on David Lettermans first CBS show in his new Broadway theater Paul Newman stood up in the audience and shouted ""Where the hell are the singing cats?"" Well here is a singing cat and for a comedian not to get moist and misty over it simply means hes being true to his own iconoclastic muse. Apatow has mixed humor and heart before but never humor so raw or heart so bleeding. He sets up his audience to go for the gross then tell them to feel deeply for the folks hes been making fun of. He wants it both ways and gets neither. Many of his fans without begrudging his stab at working outside his comfort zone will beg him to please please go back and make Judd Apatow movies.

"Funny People and Shrink Hollywood and vain | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesFunny People and Shrink Hollywood and vainMovies about celebrity traumas usually disappoint because they seek empathy from an audience more inclined to envy.Kevin Spacey plays a troubled psychiatrist to the stars in Shrink.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  Adam Sandler stars as a famous comedian who has a near-death experience.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. July 31 2009Starring Adam Sandler Seth Rogen Leslie Mann and Eric Bana. Written and directed by Judd Apatow. 136 minutes.(out of 4)Starring Kevin Spacey Robin Williams Mark Webber Keke Palmer and Pell James. Directed by Jonas Pate. 110 minutes. At the Cumberland. 14A We regular Joes and Janes cant feel the pain of people who are dissatisfied with an abundance of money sex fame and power. Give us some of that and well figure out a way to be happy Article Continued BelowSuch is the dilemma facing Funny People and Shrink films opening today that struggle to squeeze blood from a diamond.Funny People written and directed by the inescapable Judd Apatow is the better of the two but its merits seem mostly accidental. The revelations made almost sotto voce by Apatow are far more revealing about Hollywood hubris that anything in the main narrative in which Adam Sandler plays a spoiled comic superstar who is very much like Adam Sandler.This is being hailed in some quarters as the ""mature"" Apatow vision a supposed leap forward from the frat-boy hijinks of Knocked Up and The Forty Year Old Virgin. The thesis is hard to sustain amidst the barrage of penis jokes made by the various man-children in this 2 1/2-hour endurance test where initial audience goodwill is steadily beaten into submission.Sandler is George Simmons a moody comic actor with a string of implausible hit movies - with such mocking titles as Merman and My Best Friend Is a Robot - and no discernable forward momentum. He has a Hollywood mansion a parade of groupies he beds with abandon and an apparently limitless supply of adoring fans even though his jokes arent very funny.But George still pines for his lost love Laura (Leslie Mann Apatows wife) who left him 12 years earlier when he refused to grow up. She now lives in northern California with her businessman husband (Eric Bana) and the couples two daughters cutely played by Manns real daughters with Apatow.Into his hot tub of self-pity comes something for George to really stew about a medical diagnosis that hes suffering from a rare form of leukemia usually fatal. His response to the news is to rent himself a new friend/slave in the person of struggling stand-up comic Ira (Seth Rogen). Iras job is to write jokes for George but also to fetch him Diet Cokes and tell him bedtime stories. Ira has his own demons but hes eager to please. Hes trying to escape his day job of working behind a deli meat counter and the apartment he shares with fellow neurotic comics Mark (Jason Schwartzman) and Leo (Jonah Hill).Funny People actually works for about the first 90 minutes. Sandler delivers what might be his best performance better even than his previous high in Punch-Drunk Love. Nuances to his character suggest that at the age of 42 hes finally gained a few life wisdoms such as the sad reality that those groupies arent bedding him for his looks or personality. Hes also not afraid to appear selfish or unlikeable and his interplay with a more-serious Rogen seems exactly the pairing youd expect between a narcissistic star and a sycophantic fan. Wonder of wonders Sandler almost makes you feel sorry for the poor little rich boy-man.Then the last hour of the movie arrives with a thud and an abrupt change in tone. Apatow bizarrely turns it into a weird version of a home movie with his wife and daughters playing adoring and confused females while a domestic dust-up threatens.A thoughtful piece of work turns sitcom replete with pointless cameos (James Taylor and Eminem among them). You cant help wondering if Apatow is determined to sabotage his own artistic growth. Presented with an opportunity to make an honest dramatic statement about loneliness fate and life choices he turns to penis jokes stunt casting and white-picket platitudes.You could suggest that he see a psychiatrist to sort things out but surely not the one played by Kevin Spacey in Shrink another Tinseltown navel-gazer with even fewer redeeming features.Spacey is Henry Carter head-shrinker to the stars who lives in a fabulous home drives a great car and reaps fame and money from a raft of best-selling self-help books.The tomes have titles like Stop Feeling Sad advice that Henry cynically doesnt himself follow. He self-medicates with booze and smokes of various strengths seeking to dull both his mind and memories of a recent tragedy.At least he has lots of like-minded company. His clientele includes an obnoxious germaphobic talent agent (Dallas Roberts) and a sex-crazed alcoholic Hollywood actor (Robin Williams). The eye-rolling screenplay by Thomas Moffett also connects Henry with a fading actress (Saffron Burrows) an earnest screenwriter (Mark Webber) and a moody teenager (Keke Palmer) and a garrulous drug dealer (Jesse Plemons).The message seems to be that life is hell on Easy Street a revelation that apparently gobsmacked director Jonas Pate who also thought it was cool to endlessly reference other movies.Shrink leaves you with the feeling that Spacey and Williams signed on so they wouldnt have to go further than a short limo ride from their Malibu and Santa Monica abodes to make it.But ultimately it shares the same unhappy fate as Funny People and other movies of the same ilk. In seeking to depict the shallowness of Hollywood life its hard not to appear shallow yourself.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor July 31 2009 Save for later Saved Seth Rogen in a scene from ""Funny People."" Tracy Bennett/Universal Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Much is being made of the fact that the sort-of-serious ""Funny People"" is directed by Judd Apatow best known for producing a string of comedies like ""Superbad"" and ""Anchorman The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" and for directing ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up."" But is ""Funny People"" starring Adam Sandler as an Adam Sandler-like comedy superstar who is diagnosed with a possibly fatal blood disease really such a stretch?As opposed to the films hes produced which tend to be heavy on goony gross-outs the Apatow-directed movies once you strip away their goony gross-outs are actually pretty straitlaced. Steve Carells virgin is a sweet-souled innocent who believes in true love. Mismatched one-night-standers Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl in ""Knocked Up"" decide to stay together and raise their baby. This collision in Apatows movies between raunch and true romance is what makes them so distinctively odd and also I think so commercially successful. Watching them makes you feel both lowdown and upstanding. And unlike the recent ""The Ugly Truth"" where the flip-flop between gross and wholesome comes across as a cynical connivance the back and forth in Apatows movies seems genuine. Theres nothing subversive about his comedy. Hes just being naughty.In ""Funny People"" Sandlers George Simmons is the sole occupant of a stunning Malibu mansion with a sea view - testament both to his success and his emptiness. His old flame Laura (Leslie Mann) the one woman he cared about among the many he didnt is long gone. He pads about the palace like a debauched dauphin and when his medical diagnosis hits home he doesnt - to the films credit - magically turn into Mr. Softy. Hes as abrasive and self-centered as ever only now hes bewildered too. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? The other major character in ""Funny People"" is Ira (Seth Rogen) a fledging stand-up comic George hires to stay with him as a combination comedy writer-secretary. Ira had been rooming with two other young comedy dudes Mark (Jason Schwartzman) who stars in a dreadful TV sitcom and Leo (Jonah Hill) whose brand of stand-up like Iras is heavy on the horny-hormonal. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review Funny People Surprisingly given his own background Apatow doesnt really capture the raucous highs and low of the backstage/onstage comedy club circus. It also doesnt make much sense that George a major star would hire Ira a nobody with a so-so comedy routine. Were probably supposed to feel that George has hooked up with Ira precisely because hes a nobody but a nobody without much discernible talent?On the other hand the way hes portrayed George isnt exactly a laugh riot either when hes performing. The movie clips of his that we see - where he plays a merman or a squalling baby - are pretty stupid and its not clear if Apatow intended them to be that way. Is he saying that the foul-mouthed babe-busting George is a fraud for making a fortune in family entertainment drivel? Or is he saying that George deep down is a childlike innocent? Maybe a little of both.Since Ira is basically Georges glorified lackey we wait for the inevitable moment when the tables turn and the king gets his comeuppance. Its a long time coming. (The film is overlong at almost 2-1/2 hours.) In order to engineer the switcheroo Apatow reintroduces Georges ex-love Laura a former starlet now living with her two daughters and an Australian businessman husband (Eric Bana using his Aussie accent) in a Marin County mansion. (In this movie manses are a dime a dozen.) In San Francisco for a shared play date George and Ira end up hanging out at Lauras homestead while her husband is away with predictable complications. Since Leslie Mann is Apatows wife and the daughters played by Maude and Iris Apatow are their real-life children this portion of the movie has a vaguely squirmy home-movie feel.Sandler is very good though. This is not the first time hes tried to be a real actor instead of just a gagster. (""Punch-Drunk Love"" remains his biggest stretch.) The world weariness he projects as George runs deep. Its the weariness of a star who even before the bad news hits seems spiritually depleted. Its a testament to Sandlers performance that he not once milks Georges life-at-the-top malaise for easy sentimentality. As for the rest of it ""Funny People"" not quite funny enough or serious enough falls into the muddle middle. Grade B- (Rated R for language and crude sexual humor throughout and some sexuality.)

ABOUT THE MOVIEFunny People    1/2 out of fourStars Adam Sandler Seth Rogen Leslie Mann Jonah Hill Eric Bana Jason SchwartzmanDirector Judd ApatowDistributor  Universal PicturesRating R for language and crude sexual humor throughout and some sexualityRunning time 2 hours 20 minutesOpens Friday nationwide  WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Its a risky move to title a movie Funny People. SEMI-SERIOUS APATOW Writer/director takes on life and death comically in Funny People It can set up expectations that may not come to fruition. Happily that is not the case with writer/director Judd Apatows most ambitious and personal work to date. Some will not know what to make of this rambling seriocomic adventure but most will probably be riveted by its twists and turns and the interactions of its complex characters. If you let yourself be transported along for the leisurely ride the experience is at times even sublime. Its only major flaw is its length -- nearly 21/2 hours -- which in most cases is excessive for a comedy. At least 15 minutes could be edited from the last third of the film which features everyone in Apatows nuclear family but the director himself and teeters on the brink of self-indulgence. But thanks to some endearingly funny moments it recovers its way. Adam Sandler stars as George Simmons a famous comedian whose personal life is sorely lacking. He cheated on his one great love Laura (Leslie Mann) and spends his middle-aged days -- and nights -- pursuing a string of meaningless dalliances. A medical diagnosis prompts him to take stock of his unexamined life. George is by turns funny imperious engaging and self-obsessed but always compelling. It is easily Sandlers best and most multi-faceted performance. Seth Rogen is more low-key but wonderful as Ira a struggling comic working at a deli. After Iras quirky stand-up routine at a comedy club George hires him to write jokes a gig that becomes much more as George exploits Iras good nature in myriad ways. With The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up Apatow ably blended the tender and the ribald spawning several copycat rowdy/sweet comedies. But here he lets the characters be meditative taking meandering turns that real people might. Funny People nimbly intersperses humor and reflection. It is a rumination on mortality fame and life choices punctuated with Apatows trademark raunchy humor.

amyweekly >> Blog Archive >> Funny People amyweekly Amy Nicholsons reviews and interviews << Humpday 48 Hour Film Project >> Funny People Judd Apatows third (yes only third) swing at writing and direction is his most ambitious grand slam; at nearly two and a half hours its a comedy about everything life death love friendship ambition and success and the shady areas around them that you mistake for the real thing. Seth Rogan stars as Ira Wright a wannabe stand up who spends more hours working behind a deli counter than he does on stage. Hes at the proto stage every comedian has humped through alongside many more never-weres who crumpled and hung up the mic. Ira like Rogan is newly slim and open for ribbing from roommates Mark (Jason Schwartzman) and Leo (Jonah Hill) both bigger names than him Mark for starring in Yo Teach the worst sitcom on the air and Leo for his hit viral YouTube videos. Iras awestruck when George Simmons (Adam Sandler)--a comedy mega star now famous for his CGI-heavy family flicks about men with fish tails and baby bodies--barges into the Improv and decides to hire him as his personal assistant who can also write a few jokes for his return to stand up heralded by his secret diagnosis with a fatal blood disease. George and Iras relationship is the strongest thread in the movie but this isnt a bromance. Power defines their bonding--at any moment George could order him to shut up get him a Diet Coke or leave his keys and walk away. Which is how the two get entrenched in Marin County as George resolves to swoop in on the girl who got away Laura (Leslie Mann) a former actress unhappily married to an alpha male businessman (Eric Bana hilarious in his own way) and mom to two girls (Maude and Iris Apatow). This queasy adultery sequence is a detour that feels like the longest stretch of the movie but its crucial and theres no way around it. However casting his real life wife and children to audition an interloper for the role of new dad seems to make Apatow uneasy enough that the tone is erratic which turns out to be as appropriate as any other especially as theres hope--but not trust--that death has made George a better version of himself. Funny People feels lived-in the way few comedies--or honestly few films--dare to do. Apatow has copped to some autobiography in his story (rumor has it Simmons was inspired by Jerry Seinfeld). His casting is a masterstroke. Bana aside each of his actors has actually been a version of their character a funny frightened person learning how to make people laugh. Rogan and Jonah Hill are close enough to remember and weve known Sandler so long were nostalgic too when he re-watches old clips of himself all afro hair and childish enthusiasm years before his blockbusters made him a parody of himself. When he tries to woo Laura by popping in a DVD of her old acting reel its startling to see Manns actual face pop up in some 90s comedies--she hasnt aged a bit but Father Time is still breathing down our necks. Even though shes open to moving back to L.A. and giving acting a second shot were still aware of how much time shes lost; there wont be a happy ending only a less stifled one. Knocked Up was smarter than most slapstick romances but it was still glib and wishful--comic defenses Apatow shuns here. This is a comedy about things that arent always funny about people who crack jokes when theyre scared and parts of the soul that cant be healed with a pratfall. It feels true and thats going to scare audiences just in it for a laugh even though therere plenty of those. Apatow is moving the boundaries of humor until it and honesty are the same. To use the backstage lingo of comics hes killed us murdered us and blown us up using his own insecurities to strike the deadliest blows.

Universal Studios By Joe Morgenstern Updated July 31 2009 1028 a.m. ET The unlucky recipients of Procrustes hospitality were merely stretched or squeezed to fit his iron bed. The denizens of Judd Apatows ""Funny People"" have been pulled every which way to fit a misshapen concept yet they remain painfully unfunny and consistently off-putting. This is Mr. Apatows third feature as writer-director. (He has produced and/or written more than a dozen others many of them hits.) Two years ago he made ""Knocked Up"" a lusty and improbably affecting comedy starring Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl. In 2005 he directed the endearingly hilarious ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" from a script that he wrote with the films star Steve Carell. ""Funny People"" was conceived as something more ambitious a comedy about aging and mortality. Adam Sandler is George Simmons a famous comic who learns he has a life-threatening illness. Mr. Rogen co-stars as Ira Wright a deli counterman and aspiring stand-up who is hired by George to write jokes then becomes the older mans opening act and confidant. Maybe George hires Ira because hes so depressed by his medical news that he thinks Ira is funny though he is not. Maybe the point of Iras unfunniness and all the unfunniness to come is that comics are lonely desperate people (George certainly fills the bill) or that the state of contemporary stand-up is lamentable--a point that the movie drives home whether intentionally or not with a succession of comedy scenes distinguished only by the repetitiveness and impoverishment of their scatology. Still the failures of ""Funny People"" go far beyond funny or un. Mr. Apatow doesnt seem to know what to make of George or how to keep us involved as he journeys through the depths of despair (which arent all that deep) toward the stirrings (though were negligibly stirred) of hope. Its not a good sign that the most interesting stage in Georges crabwise development recalls the monstrosity of Lonesome Rhodes in ""A Face in the Crowd."" A conventionally happy ending was clearly not in the cards but the film falls into a sourness thats barely relieved by Iras coming of age in a rambling subplot that of necessity becomes the plot. Mr. Sandlers presence proves a mixed blessing. He does bring his own celebrity to the production but his part isnt one he can submerge himself in as he did in Paul Thomas Andersons ""Punch-Drunk Love"" so he cruises through the film without much energy or conviction; even Georges rages come off as perfunctory. Mr. Rogen is often adrift in a role that short-circuits the actors vast capacity for exuberance. The cast includes Leslie Mann whos effortfully but genuinely charming as Georges ex-girlfriend Eric Bana is her Aussie husband. The running time is 146 minutes and thats no joke. The Cove ""The Cove"" is many things at once an eco-shocker about the slaughter of dolphins a quasidocumentary framed as a high-tech thriller and as if that werent enough a tale of a sinner seeking redemption. The title refers to a secluded lagoon in the town of Taiji on Japans southern Pacific coast. Thats where fishermen conduct an annual kill--legal activity alas even though it takes place inside a national park--by chasing dolphins from the open sea into the cove whose waters turn crimson as the frantic animals are speared to death on camera and cut up for a marginal market in dolphin meat. The sinner self-avowed is a former dolphin trainer Ric OBarry; he caught and trained the five dolphins who played the title role in the TV series ""Flipper."" The series was so popular that it spawned a vogue in marine amusement parks which turned dolphins into entertainers. (To an extent that ""The Cove"" never makes clear the Taiji kill is a byproduct of efforts to catch dolphins that may be sold to such parks for as much as 150000 per animal.) To atone for his own role in the fateful celebrity of smaller cetaceans Mr. OBarry became an eco-activist freeing captive dolphins on many occasions. As the hero of this piece hes the leader of an expedition that uses hi-def cameras (hidden in artificial rocks by special-effects wizards at Industrial Light amp; Magic) hydrophones and night-vision technology to penetrate the secrecy that surrounds the horrific kill. ""The Cove"" was produced by the billionaire entrepreneur Jim Clark and the adventure is as exciting as it is elaborate--lots of cat-and-mouse tension between the eco-provocateurs and a hostile assortment of cops and local thugs. But theres also lots of tension between the productions educational function and its agitprop style. The film makes its case graphically to say the least yet muddies its bloody waters with an excess of artifice and a dearth of facts. Flame amp; Citron Two melancholy Danes share center stage in ""Flame amp; Citron"" a fascinating film by Ole Christian Madsen but neither one of them is Hamlet. They are members of the Resistance in occupied Denmark during World War II and they seldom hesitate to gun down Nazis or Nazi sympathizers. Their problem is distinguishing enemies from friends and continuing to kill without becoming as culpable as the worst of their murderous victims. If youre looking for an action thriller this isnt it. The pace is deliberate the tone is pensive albeit punctuated by occasional violence and the style is exceedingly lean; characters reveal themselves mainly through moral choices. Still were told of a specific incident that motivated Flame a young redhead played powerfully by Thure Lindhardt and we get a vivid sense of the emotional solitude that imprisons the older Citron. (Hes played laconically by the superb Mads Mikkelsen.) The film is based on true events Flame and Citron (both noms de guerre) became national heroes. But its really a meditation on the nature of heroism and the quest for purity of purpose. Lornas Silence ENLARGE Arta Dobroshi has the title role in Lornas Silence. In ""Lornas Silence"" a somber beauty of a French-language drama by the Belgian filmmakers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne the heroine is looking for purity of purpose too though she doesnt know it or cant articulate it to herself. Lorna an Albanian emigre in the process of gaining Belgian citizenship (shes played exquisitely by Arta Dobroshi) dreams of opening a snack bar with her boyfriend. But doing so depends on her keeping silent about a criminal scheme that may cost the life of another man Claudy whom she has come inconveniently to love. (Hes played by a Dardenne veteran the always impressive Jeremie Renier.) Every time predictability threatens the plot takes an unexpected turn that traps Lorna more tightly between her love and the thugs who run her life. Like earlier Dardenne films ""Lornas Silence"" is naturalistic yet this one beautifully shot in 35 mm film by Alain Marcoen achieves a poetry of bereftness. ""They want to kill us"" Lorna says near the end. ""Dont worry Ill protect you."" Simpler words were never spoken in more startling circumstances. Adam The closer ""Adam"" stays to its vital center the stronger the story is. The title character is played by Hugh Dancy who cant lose for being winning as a 20-something with Aspergers Syndrome. Aspergers is ""on the autism spectrum"" we are told by a minor character in a mercifully brief spasm of didacticism. What we are shown largely thanks to Mr. Dancys fine performance is that the spectrum is wide and the colors are intense but not nuanced. Thats because those with Aspergers find nuance baffling if not unfathomable. They may be extremely intelligent--Adam surely is--but they cant compute ambiguity cant intuit what other people are thinking and may struggle fearfully in social situations. Moving out from that center the film which was written and directed by Max Mayer plunges Adam into a love affair with a beautiful kindergarten teacher Beth; shes played appealingly by Rose Byrne. Their romance computes--the common denominator is need--but it doesnt convince and a subplot involving Beths larcenous father grows terribly intrusive. Nevertheless ""Adam"" succeeds at getting inside its heros mind and more impressively still gives us entree to his singular soul. Not Quite Hollywood The Wild Untold Story of Ozploitation A survey of the week wouldnt be complete without a left-handed salute--not to be confused with a backhanded compliment--to the gleeful rubbish of ""Not Quite Hollywood The Wild Untold Story of Ozploitation"" Mark Hartleys documentary chronicles the explosion of exploitation--mostly sexploitation--pictures that began in the late 1960s when Australia like the U.S. was swept by cyclones of social change and continued through the 1970s and 1980s to the consternation of censors and readily scandalized persons of refined taste. The scuzzy films represented here by titillating clips are an assault on refined taste. Theyre also a reminder of the movie industrys ragged roots. Quentin Tarantino serves as a fanboy curator of the collection but my favorite quote concerning the late schlockmeister Tim Burstall comes from an Aussie film critic named Bob Ellis ""He was scum really he was a crab louse on the Australian film industry. On the other hand all of us will always owe him everything."" DVD FOCUS Punch-Drunk Love(2002) If you go in expecting a standard Adam Sandler comedy you may come out convinced that the world is even crazier than you thought. Mr. Sandler is indeed the main attraction; hes amazing and also used amazingly well as an addled lover named Barry Egan. (Emily Watson is lovely as Lena the woman of Barrys fevered dreams.) Paul Thomas Andersons marvelous maddening comedy is about anxiety a state of mind and spastic body that in Barrys case can be relieved only through romantic fantasies or explosive rage. Robert Elswit did the cinematography. Jon Brion provided the gorgeous score. Richard Pryor Live In Concert (1979) For joyous and inspired scatology--and for stand-up comedy of any description--the first of Richard Pryors concert films remains in a class by itself. Its surely the best comic performance ever captured on film and possibly the best period; someone on the Internet Movie Database calls it the ""Citizen Kane"" of comedy which seems like a fair appraisal. The venue was in Long Beach Calif. and the time was before the horrific freebasing accident that set Pryor on fire but after his heart attack--an event that he recounts with surpassing originality and heart-stopping zest. La Promesse (1996) Jeremie Renier is Igor a 15-year-old boy with long dirty-blond hair in the Dardenne brothers modest masterpiece about the possibility of kindness. Unlike Lorna Igor is Belgian by birth. Very much like her hes caught up in a squalid scheme to take advantage of illegal immigrants. One of them a Ghanian named Hamidou suffers what is plainly a fatal injury. When Hamidou implores Igor to take care of his wife and child Igor listens apparently unmoved but then mumbles fatefully ""I promise you."" What follows is the stirring spectacle of a callow child growing--slowly--into a moral being. --Joe Morgenstern Find television listings at LocateTV.

Starring Seth Rogen Adam Sandler Jonah Hill Eric Bana Leslie Mann Jason Schwartzman Director Judd Apatow Running time 226  Editorial Review Ann HornadayWashington Post Staff WriterJuly 31 2009Writer-director Judd Apatow makes his intent clear in the very title of ""Funny People"" whose double meaning resonates throughout this often hilarious weird sad and ultimately brave movie. The stand-up comedians who populate the film are funny ha-ha sure. But theyre also funny strange and Apatow demonstrates both sides of those often confounding personalities with an alert crude compassionate eye.As ""Funny People"" opens comic superstar George Simmons (Adam Sandler) visits his doctors office to receive the news that he is suffering from a rare probably fatal form of leukemia. Back at his Italianate mansion by the sea hes alone with his impending mortality He has no one to tell.Meanwhile Ira Wright (Seth Rogen) toils at his day job at a deli while working the unpaid Los Angeles comedy club circuit by night. When George goes to a club to get in touch with his stand-up roots he catches Iras act and asks him to be his writing assistant and it turns out one-man entourage.This is only the beginning of ""Funny People"" which proceeds to take thoroughly unexpected turns as George reassesses his life reconnecting with family friends and his ex-fiancee (played by Apatows real-life wife the sublime Leslie Mann). Meanwhile Iras ambiguous relationship with George -- which exists in that vaguely uncomfortable zone between paid employee and soul mate -- affects his other friendships especially with his roommates Leo (Jonah Hill) and Mark (Jason Schwartzman).Make no mistake ""Funny People"" is unmistakably an Apatow film meaning it obeys the generic conventions of such predecessors as ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"" in trotting out raunchy jokes about the male anatomy with tiresome metronomic regularity. But here Apatow seems particularly keen to explore the anxieties sexual aggression and almost primal competitiveness simmering just under the jokes infantile surface.Like a glossier version of the recent indie comedy ""Humpday"" Apatows ""Funny People"" offers a candid glimpse into the ritualized repressed dynamics of male friendship from the passive-aggressive way Mark -- a newly minted sitcom star -- happens to leave his paycheck on roommate Iras pillow to a fight scene staged with hilariously authentic missed shots and frightened mincing chases.That sequence which happens to feature the very Eric Bana that Rogen and Hill credited with their sex lives in ""Knocked Up"" is one of several hilarious set pieces in ""Funny People"" a movie in which big-name cameo players crop up early and often. A scene featuring James Taylor is brilliantly orchestrated by Apatow and a later scene with Eminem -- set at a party attended by such real-life stand-ups as Norm Macdonald Carol Leifer and Ray Romano -- is perversely amusing even if it exists solely to set up a groaner of a one-liner.Even the most forced artificial episodes in ""Funny People"" ring oddly true because Georges life -- the obscene wealth the loneliness the fame -- is odd. Perhaps not since ""Sunset Boulevard"" have the wages and eccentricities of celebrity been depicted with such tough almost perverse honesty.And like that film Apatow has found the perfect actor to embody the dark side of fame in Sandler who may be uniquely qualified to play a man who is universally loved but not very likable. As he did in ""Punch-Drunk Love"" and ""Reign Over Me"" Sandler wisely underplays in ""Funny People"" never begging for sympathy even when George is at his existential nadir. Indeed viewers could see ""Funny People"" almost entirely as a commentary on Sandlers own persona as he assumes the funny voices and accents that have made him a star strumming his guitar to compose improvised ditties about (what else?) Iras nether regions and later the contempt he feels for his own audience.Its these moments that make ""Funny People"" a brave movie especially for a filmmaker who could so easily coast on the joke/setup/joke paradigm hes so profitably mastered. Instead Apatow has decided to make a long somewhat shapeless movie that steadfastly refuses to adhere to a rigid narrative structure. The result is a story that feels loose-limbed and slightly messed up following its own idiosyncratic course to get at truths that cant be contained in three acts.At nearly 2 1/2 hours ""Funny People"" is arguably too long but in the final analysis it earns that running time if only because its that rare mainstream Hollywood movie that feels genuinely spontaneous unafraid to keep the audience just a little bit confounded and off-balance.As for the audience itself ""Funny People"" will no doubt resonate best with people tuned to a frequency that appreciates references to Wilco Warren Zevon and the Raconteurs as well as nonstop penis jokes. (It bears noting that Iras quirky love interest played by the wonderfully deadpan Aubrey Plaza gets to deliver a welcome feminist retort.)But it would be a shame if ""Funny People"" didnt find a wider audience beyond Apatows core following if only because George and Ira inhabit such ambitious strange territory for a filmmaker who seems newly invigorated and inspired. He even earns the Gershwin reference in the names hes chosen for his creative fractious protagonists. From his persistent vulgarity to newer more serious themes involving sorrow regret and moral reckoning Apatow has created his own characteristically bent rhapsody in blue.Contains profanity and crude sexual humor throughout and some sexuality.

Apatow writes with warmth and wit but hes no soft touch. He knows George can be a cruel bastard impossible to live with but the fucker is funny. Jokes have always been his weapons of choice. More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> The same goes for Apatow. This is only his third film as a director following The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up but his influence is so pervasive that hes credited or blamed for every bromance on the market. The potently hilarious Funny People shot by Schindlers List Oscar winner Janusz Kaminski no less is Apatows most personal film. He roomed with Sandler when they first came to L.A. They both did stand-up only Sandler was better at it. Seth Rogen basically has the Apatow role as Ira -- ""Schmyra"" to George -- the struggling writer whom the big star brings in to create material for his act. Hes amazed at the babes who lay down for his boss. ""Im a story they tell their friends"" shrugs George a pussy hound with no illusions. At the start Ira is the only one George tells about his disease. They bond but only till Ira gets too close. Then hes reminded ""Youre not my friend you work for me."" Apatow has taken pains to say that this is not a biopic. George is a nightmare version of what he and Sandler might have become without the healing balance of wives and children. That part of the equation is represented by Leslie Mann (Mrs. Apatow) as Laura the girl George lost by cheating on her. Now mired in a bad marriage to a skirt-chasing Aussie (Eric Bana demonstrating real comic flair) Laura takes solace in their two children played by the directors two adorable daughters with Mann Iris and Maude Apatow. Learning of Georges illness and possible remission Laura is pulled apart emotionally. Mann one of the strongest arguments for nepotism in the business is simply sensational in the role finding the right blend of humor and heartbreak in a woman who is understandably reluctant to give her trust to a man. Lauras divided loyalties are symptomatic of the film. Apatow has many stories to tell too many. Iras life in the house he shares with two competitive friends -- a riotous Jonah Hill as a fellow writer and a terrific Jason Schwartzman (he also did the music) as an actor who stars in the deliciously demented sitcom Yo Teach -- could be its own movie and a good one. But the soul of Funny People is in the stand-up. Rogen wonderful throughout is a hoot delivering a bit about Tom Cruise David Beckham and Will Smith mushing the tips of their dicks together just because theyre bored rich guys. And its a treat watching Sandler mix it up with other comics including Paul Reiser Sarah Silverman and Ray Romano. There are lots of guest shots including a killer one from Eminem who tells George hed be better off dead than making more stupid movies. Food for thought. But no worries about this perceptive deeply entertaining boundary-pusher. Its the work of a major talent. Apatow scores by crafting the film equivalent of a stand-up routine that encompasses the joy pain anger loneliness and aching doubt that go into making an audience laugh. For his funny people that really is a matter of life and death. Dont Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox.

There are experimental drugs but the odds are not in Georges favor.And so Judd Apatows long and winding often wildly funny and sometimes mawkish movie begins. For a while its hard to predict how things will play out and theres the feeling - especially deep in that second hour - that the rough road ahead is right under foot.But by the end of its almost 21/2 hours - after more phallus-centric jokery than you can shake a um stick at - Funny People turns out to be fairly predictable and not so rough. In a thoroughly satisfying way.A comedy about showbiz celebrity (its lonely at the top) about male bonding men and women sex and selfishness and the fraternity (with a few females included) of stand-up Funny People is sappy loopy inspired hysterical.For Apatow - writer/director of The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up and producer of a veritable slew of raunchy comic meditations on adolescence and addled adulthood - Funny People represents an ambitious summing up of his pet themes. He grapples with issues like marriage family infidelity and yes death. But the juvenile nincompoopery and the poop jokes are there too. And did we mention the obsession with male genitalia?And so armed with his grim prognosis George retreats to his beachfront manse to wallow in self-pity. He gets misty-eyed watching his hits (Re-do Mer-man My Best Friend Is a Robot). He does a club gig - and runs into a young struggling comic Ira Wright (Seth Rogen) there. George hires Ira to write gags and to be his personal assistant. This is a step up from the supermarket deli counter where he works and Ira - who shares a Hollywood apartment with a sitcom star (an amusingly vain Jason Schwartzman) and a fellow struggling comic (Jonah Hill) - takes the job.And then he takes a private jet with George for his big-paycheck performance at MySpace headquarters. In its details and depiction of the life of a Hollywood star - pampered protected - Funny People feels very real.In that same verisimilitudinous vein the movie has real funny people in it too Paul Reiser Ray Romano George Wallace and other punch-line pros show up as themselves. Sarah Silverman is there doing incredibly strange stuff with her mouth. And rapper Eminem delivers a lofty loony rant.Leslie Mann Apatows real-life wife is goofily luminous as Georges ex - now living in the Bay Area with a dashing Aussie (Eric Bana) and their two cute-as-buttons daughters (Apatow and Manns real-life daughters). Its this second half of the film with its scenes of domestic incertitude that threatens to implode in a narrative muddle. But thanks to Manns and Banas fine comic turns to Rogens shaggy drollery and Sandlers Sandleresqueness it never does.Theres almost too much good stuff in Funny People. Aubrey Plaza as a brainy comedienne Ira falls for has a dismissive scowl to die for. And will it ever be possible to watch David Beckham Tom Cruise and Will Smith again without thinking of the wild monologue that Ira works them - or a key part of their respective anatomies - into?Time will tell but Apatows Funny People is some kind of legacy anyway.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Email| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + It is I guess an unbreakable law of show business physics that if you keep telling someone hes a comedy genius hell disavow the comedy and obsess about the genius. Hell get serious as if the gift of transporting audiences with laughter werent profound enough on its own. Down this road have gone Charlie Chaplin Jerry Lewis Woody Allen Robin Williams and many many more and now its Judd Apatows turn. Apatow the director of ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin and writer-producer of countless bad-lad farces may not stand with the above company but at the moment hes about the best weve got and ""Funny People is his cri de coeur. Todays lesson Being funny isnt any fun.Correction Being a world-famous fabulously successful Hollywood comedi an is no fun. Forgive me if I have trouble whipping up the appropriate sympathy. ""Funny People which is deadly earnest beneath its scum of raunchy dialogue tells the tale of George Simmons (Adam Sandler) an A-list star of blockbuster comedies with titles like ""Merman and ""Re-Do. He lives in an empty mansion has no friends and is more or less a self-absorbed jerk. He has also just been informed he has a rare and probably fatal blood disease.Youre thinking OK now George will spend the rest of the movie learning to hug puppies and when he befriends one such puppy a struggling stand-up comic named Ira Wright (Seth Rogen) the pieces of his redemption seem in place. Whats notionally good about ""Funny People is that Apatow knows its not that easy - that Hollywood Scrooges stay Scrooged no matter how much trendy psychobabble they talk.Whats best about ""Funny People actually is Sandler who takes the weird resentful anger that has always coursed beneath his comedy and puts it right on the surface. George is genuinely unpleasant in private yet profanely hilarious in public; because he lives for the crowd he has no interest in individuals. Sandler knows something about this I think and while his range as a serious actor is extremely narrow he can cut surprisingly deep within those limits. This is his best dramatic work by far conveying the dead-eyed piteousness of a George Simmons without begging us to like him.The rest of the movie does that for him or tries to. Rogens Ira is an unworkable paradox a stand-up whos also a passive-aggressive sap and when George takes him on as an assistant - and as the sole person whos in on the stars medical secret - the gofer tries to humanize the boss. This leads to such near-sublime moments as a fit of weeping (Ira not George) in the Palm restaurant but Apatow whos back in the directors chair with his own script tries to cover too many bases. Ira has the full complement of nutty trash-talking Apatovian roommates Jonah Hill as a combustible rival stand-up; Jason Schwartzman as a preening sitcom star; the mordantly pretty Aubrey Plaza as the comedienne next door. They hit their marks and get their scabrous laughs. In other words the film wants to touch on human truths and still bring the funny. That can and has been done (submitted for your approval ""City Lights ""Sullivans Travels ""Annie Hall ""Groundhog Day) but because Apatow hasnt figured out the proper mix he adds instead of subtracts. And adds and adds At 146 increasingly strained minutes ""Funny People is two movies the first (and better) of which concerns Georges illness and ends at around the 90-minute mark.The second movie is about the stars attempts to win back the ex-flame he years ago chased away with his boorish behavior. Shes married with children now and is played by Apatows wife Leslie Mann; the kids are played by his daughters Maude and Iris. This isnt quite as nepotistic as it seems since Mann is a brightly sardonic comic actress and the girls make a cute vaudeville tag team one deadpan the other dreamy.Yet the final hour which takes place over a long weekend in Marin County goes nowhere slowly. The point - George may be cured but hes no better - is lost amid the unfocused farce and its up to Eric Bana to walk away with the honors as the exs husband a cheerfully neurotic stud. The only way to salvage this part of ""Funny People would have been to hack it off like a diseased limb and I say this as someone with an unhealthy admiration for the charms of Leslie Mann.The problem is that Apatow is stuck between gears. (That and theres probably no one around him to say no at this point.) Hiring the great cinematographer Janusz Kaminski (""Schindlers List and so on) means little when a director lacks a distinct visual sensibility. Trying to honestly portray the way people simultaneously need and use each other is impossible when all the characters can do is talk about each others testicles.Pottymouth has served Apatow well; few recent moviemakers wield gutter-talk with such scurrilous wit. The endless groin jokes in ""Funny People though go beyond shock-comedy into pathology - theyre the equivalent of a nervous tic. Gross-out humor is Apatows security blanket and hell never move on until he gives up that blanket. If he can - if he wants to - he may yet make a real shocker a comedy thats both funny and rich.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2009 Globe Newspaper Company.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet In Funny Peoples early scenes Adam Sandler broods alone in a dim sprawling mansion surrounded by mementoes of a career whose stand-up roots have been overshadowed by stardom via movies like My Best Friend Is A Robot. Starstruck women come and go along with gardeners and maids but if he dies tomorrow--and the doctor treating his rare form of leukemia suggests thinking much further into the future is foolish--hell die alone. Thats the grim setup for Judd Apatows Funny People which portrays the way wealth and fame eludes those who seek it--particularly those with integrity and scruples--and the hollowness awaiting those who find it. Seth Rogen co-stars as a struggling stand-up who impresses Sandler at a club then gets recruited to write jokes and run errands for the superstar. Soon hes taking private jets warming up for Sandler at corporate gigs and wearing a dumbstruck expression that contrasts starkly with Sandlers jaded face. Theyre a life in bookends If Rogen stays in the game long enough hell end up in the same state. Again showing a neglected aptitude for subtlety and melancholy Sandler plays the part with a knowing sadness and the struggling comics who fill out the cast provide a constant reminder than even manchildren have to get old eventually. Sandler is so convincing and the film so guardedly affectionate of its world of attention-starved cut-ups that it starts to run into trouble when it tries to imagine the larger world. Leslie Mann plays the long-lost love of Sandlers life now a mother of two who suspects her husband (Eric Bana) is straying. She and Sandler convincingly create a sense of shared history but their relationship seems less like the inevitable focal point than another loose end in a film thats loaded with them. Like The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up Funny People arrives filled with supporting characters and subplots that make the film feel simultaneously humane and overstuffed. Its refreshingly unformulaic but a rambling mess. Its also tremendously funny. But for all the dick jokes the films Apatow writes and directs double as moral inquiries. Funny People is short on heroes and villains and long on chances for good people to make soul-eroding mistakes. In Sandlers blockbuster-funded Xanadu Apatow has found a vision of hell.

(Universal Studios) Joe Neumaier Thursday July 30 2009 203 PM Title Funny People The funny business is lame in ""Funny People"" and the people feel phony. So whats left in this dramedy about a comics near-tragedy? Well how do bad standup and schmaltzy emotions sound?Its not that writer-director Judd Apatow isnt aware of the beats he needs to hit. Apatow was comedys best-kept secret until ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" ""Knocked Up"" and countless bromance flicks made him a brand name. Here he just doesnt see how the insular world of show business rarely connects to audiences how raunchy guy-speak isnt all that amusing and how sad clowns arent fun.Adam Sandler is that sad clown the movies one smart move. As George Simmons a Robin Williams-esque performer who goes from goofy college kid (who we see in actual footage of a twentysomething Sandler) to a self-hating mansion-dwelling Hollywood big shot Sandler is the most effective thing here.As George takes to L.A. comedy stages to try and once again forge a connection with people he meets Ira Wright (Seth Rogen) a hungry standup whose break comes when George asks him to be his assistant. A cliched setup like that deserves the line ""... and they change each other in unexpected ways.""And Apatow does go all the expected ways before introducing a truly deadly third-act involving Georges reconciliation with Laura (Leslie Mann Apatows real-life wife) his great lost love and a faceoff with Lauras tough Aussie husband (a too-intense Eric Bana). To load the deck even further Apatow and Manns cute kids appear as Lauras offspring.The self-referencing in ""Funny People"" gets old fast. Comedian cameos abound with Iras roommates (Jason Schwartzman and Apatow regular Jonah Hill) being a hip sitcom star and a wanna-be standup. Iras crush from across the street (Aubrey Plaza) is a Janeane Garofalo-in-training and Georges mansion is filled with posters of his Williams-style hit movies. Its hard to find sympathy for these self-involved characters.Sandler has the chops for better stuff (as shown in ""Punch-Drunk Love"" ""Reign Over Me"" and even ""Big Daddy"") and Apatow should have asked for more acting from him and less silly voices. Rogen thinner now and less interesting to boot is a frustratingly one-note wide-eyed innocent. Youre left trying to judge Iras mood by his wacky T-shirt-of-the-day choices.Which sadly is about as deep as this 21/2 -hour movie gets.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"Funny People reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Funny People reviewed. Funny People reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 30 2009 349 PM Funny People Judd Apatows niceness problem. By Dana Stevens After youve seen Funny People come back and listen to our Spoiler Special discussion on Judd Apatows take on laughter and terminal diseases You can also click hereto download the MP3 file or youll find this and dozens of other Spoiler Specials in our iTunes podcast feed here. Adam Sandler and Seth Rogen in Funny People Judd Apatow may be the first filmmaker to jeopardize his career through excessive niceness. Hes already done some damage to his reputation as Hollywoods best director of mainstream comedies by lending his name to other projects too often. In the past five years 16 movies have been released with Apatows name in some way attached most of them written and directed by members of the loose band of friends and proteges who comprise his talent pool. Some of these films are funny ( Superbad Forgetting Sarah Marshall) some are mediocre (Step Brothers Year One) and some are exceedingly lame ( Drillbit Taylor). But to the public they all more or less register as Apatow productions and the cumulative effect is annoying like a constant buzz of not-quite-audible dick jokes in the nations collective ear. This overexposure has not escaped the Universal Pictures marketing department which has invaded prime time with a trailer reminding us that Funny People is only ""the third film from Judd Apatow."" Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Before I go off on that ad campaign (in the poster Seth Rogen and Leslie Mann snuggle up to Adam Sandler like kittens completely belying the films tone and content and all but purring ""See our movie"") let me stipulate that I quite enjoyed the third film from Judd Apatow. Funny People has the shagginess and overambition of a ""sophomore novel"" but as with many sophomore novels its the flaws that make it fascinating. Its too long but scene by scene its never boring. The story unfolds in leisurely swaths that could be regarded either as rich explorations of character or self-indulgent digressions. Its that niceness problem again; Apatow loves his characters and his actors not wisely but too well. He cant bear to sacrifice one joke one tear one chance to ogle his pretty wife and frequent leading lady Leslie Mann. And though she and his buddies may love him for it that all-inclusiveness is harming Apatows work. Advertisement Its hard to imagine theres a Slate reader who doesnt already know Funny Peoples basic story (or am I overestimating the Orwellian reach of Universals publicity department?). Adam Sandler plays George Simmons a hugely successful movie comedian who learns hes dying of a rare blood disease. Unmarried friendless and miserable in his cocoon of fame George drops by an improv club for an unannounced standup set. His morbid self-pitying jokes bomb but George doesnt much care (mercifully sparing us the ""flop sweat"" scene usually required in any film about standup comedy). At the club George meets Ira Wright (Seth Rogen) a young aspiring comic and the two enter into an uneasy and ill-defined relationship. After hiring Ira to write him some topical jokes for a corporate standup gig George takes him in as a kind of paid friend someone who will talk him to sleep at night and accompany him to doctors appointments during the day. Ira cant decide whether to marvel at his own luck or protest his mistreatment at the hands of the volatile George whose affect shifts in seconds from playfulness to confessional neediness to morose rage. The first two-thirds of the movie takes place in a comedy cocoon whose airlessness is entirely intentional. Ira lives with two other up-and-coming comedians Leo and Mark (Jonah Hill and Jason Schwartzman) in an apartment plastered with posters of Rodney Dangerfield and Peter Sellers. Mark whos just landed the lead in an awful sitcom called Yo Teach effortlessly seduces a female standup comic (Aubrey Plaza) whom Ira covets for himself. When George first calls to enlist Iras help writing jokes he asks him to solicit material from Leo as well--but Ira deliberately fails to pass that on to his roommate leading to a rift in their friendship when Leo learns hes been shafted. Forget the cuddlesome poster Among these funny people jokes are not occasions for laughter and connection but pieces of hard cold currency and occasionally concealed weapons. The biggest revelation is Adam Sandler whom Ive always found to be an energy-sucking vortex on-screen not funny not dramatically interesting not appealing as a romantic lead. Even Punch Drunk Love which skillfully mined the vein of anger beneath Sandlers childlike comedy ultimately fell back on the conviction that deep down audiences would find him irresistible. Funny People makes no such assumptions; Sandlers George Simmons is a thoroughgoing prick self-serving and thoughtlessly cruel and yet hes not the villain of the piece. Sandler is extraordinary communicating Georges keen intelligence his loneliness his desperate fear of death and his almost autistic incomprehension of human relationships without falling into the cliche of the tragic clown. Seth Rogen slimmed down since his last appearance in Observe and Report makes an amiable foil but he isnt given anywhere near as juicy a character to work with. The well-meaning commonsensical Ira is essentially an audience proxy. Midway through the movie George reconnects with his ex-girlfriend Laura (Mann) who told that hes dying confesses that shes never fully gotten over him even though shes married to a wealthy businessman (played with infectious gusto by Eric Bana) and has two children (played by Apatow and Manns lovely but decidedly nonthespian daughters). Abruptly the movies setting shifts from the showbiz fishbowl of L.A. to the posh Marin County suburbs as George and Ira crash at Lauras guesthouse for an awkward visit. Advertisement Its this last act thats received the most criticism (and which likely contains the 30 minutes that Universal unsuccessfully tried to get Apatow to cut). And theres no question the tonal shift is jarring with romantic farce (Lauras husband comes back early from a business trip interrupting her and Georges idyll) replacing the black comedy of the earlier movie. There are also some scenes that beg for excision I could have done without any shots of dogs licking peanut butter off the leads faces much less an extended montage. Yet some of the movies strongest dramatic moments also take place in this baggy final third. As Laura is considering leaving her husband for George she shows George and Ira a home video of her daughter singing a show tune in a school play. While Ira wells up at the little girls performance George checks his cell phone and complains about his agent. Its a great scene with Lauras disillusionment Georges obliviousness and Iras helpless entrapment in their drama all playing out side by side. Funny People ends with an upbeat final coda thats so out of tune with the movies message that it almost feels like a tacked-on studio ending. But it couldnt have been; at this stage in his career Apatow answers to no one. His worst enemy as a director is his unwillingness to linger in the dark places from which his comedy springs. Sandlers George Simmons is a guy who when fate offers him the chance to be a good person chooses to be funny instead. Judd Apatows problem is just the opposite; he could be the funniest director in Hollywood if he stopped being such a good guy.

"Funny People | RichardRoeper.com BLOG On Camera RR YOUTUBE CHANNEL QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS Home    Movie Reviews    Funny People Print Page Email Page Search Funny People (2009; Rated ) B+ "" Seriously funny."" -Richard Roeper MOVIE INFORMATION Funny People(2009; R)In theaters Friday 31 July 2009Official Movie Site www.funnypeoplemovie.com Summary George is a very successful stand up comedian who learns that he has an untreatable blood disorder and is given less than a year to live. Ira is a struggling up-and-coming stand up comedian who works at a deli and has yet to figure out his onstage persona. One night these two perform at the same club and George takes notice of Ira. George hires Ira to be his semi-personal assistant as well as his friend. Genre Comedy DramaDirector Judd ApatowCast Adam Sandler Seth Rogen Great comedy often springs from a bottomless well of anger and hostility. When a comic bounds backstage after a triumphant set he never says ""I loved that audience"" He says ""I killed"" When he has a terrible set he dies. He bombed. No other entertainment form is so riddled with violent terminology. The characters in ""Funny People"" are openly hostile even when they express friendship and concern for one another or when theyre just meeting someone. Their humor is their defense mechanism and they rarely rarely lower that shield. Thank God they have an outlet for all that anger or theyd be arming themselves and reciting lines from ""Taxi Driver"" while staring into a mirror. ""Funny People"" is a seriously funny movie starring Adam Sandler as Adam Sandler-esque comic-turned-movie star who might be dying. Not onstage----in life. The Judd Apatow comedic factory has produced a seemingly endless stream of hit films in recent years but this is just the third film directed by Apatow following ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up."" Like Apatows previous efforts this is a rambling raunchy winning and oft-times hilarious film. Its also a much more sophisticated and layered story with heavy brushtrokes of pathos and tears. And it takes a hard right turn about two-thirds of the way through that doesnt really work and nearly derails a potentially great comedy. (More on that in a moment.) The film opens with footage Apatow shot of Sandler some 20 years ago when they were struggling young hopefuls. Sandlers making a prank phone call thats funny only because he finds it so funny. Cut to 20 years later and Sandlers George is a huge star thanks to a string of comedies that sound an awful lot like the worst Adam Sandler movies imaginable. In one comedy hes a Merman--half man half fish. In another his adult head sits atop a babys body. George lives in a ridiculous mansion. Everywhere he goes young women throw themselves at him while young men hurry to capture his image on cell phone cameras. Hes living the dream----but hes got no one to share the dream with. In fact hes so isolated from any real human contact that when hes told he has a rare potentially fatal blood disease the only person with whom he shares this news is his recently hired assistant an aspiring comic named Ira played by Seth Rogen (who seems to be in every other movie these days). The heart of the story is the dynamic between George and Ira as George tries to become a better man before time runs out and Ira tries to become a genuine friend to George while learning to write and tell jokes at the foot of a master. If this film starred Robin Williams and was directed by someone with a duller comedic wit it could have been a treacly goo-fest of cheap sentimentality. Apatow isnt above leaning on Warren Zevons ""Keep Me In Your Heart"" or giving us a medley of George getting sicker and sicker while Ira tends to him-----but he also peppers the story with dick joke after dick joke after dick joke and some hilarious moments courtesy of Jonah Hill and Jason Schwartzman as Iras fellow comic roommates; newcomer Aubrey Plaza; as a hot-geek-girl comic and RZA as Iras coworker. Hell even James Taylor gets in a couple of zingers. You heard me James Taylor. James F------- ""Fire and Rain"" Taylor. For the first 90 minutes as George comes to terms with his illness while bonding with Ira and returning to his stand-up roots Im thinking this might be best movie of the year depending on how Apatow resolves Georges illness. But this film runs 150 minutes---thats just three minutes shy of the original theatrical running time of ""Apocalypse Now"" for crying out loud--so weve got another hour to go and nearly all of that hour is devoted to a road trip to Marin County where Georges the-one-that-got-away ex-girlfriend lives with her husband and two children. Apatows wife Leslie Mann plays Laura who still loves George and is once again drawn to him now that he could be dead soon or at least more emotionally available than he was back in the day. Her daughters (played by Apatows and Manns girls) are smart and funny and adorable. But her hunky Australian husband (Eric Bana in a terrific performance) is more than a bit of a wanker who is on the road most of the time giving George the opportunity to swoop in for a visit that turns into a dinner that turns into an overnight stay that turns into an extended version of playing house much to the concern of tag-along Ira. (Not to mention the two girls who suddenly have this goofy guy from their favorite movies acting like their stepfather.) The family melodrama slams the brakes on much of the comedy as the husband returns home unexpectedly and is soon insulting his wife Ira and George engage in bitter verbal fisticuffs Laura whines about her aborted career and George falls back into his self-centered ways. Mann gamely tries to make Laura someone we care about and Bana displays a deft comedic touch but I wanted to yank George and Ira out of there and get them back to Los Angeles where all the interesting/crazy/funny characters in their lives reside. After all the sidebars and detours ""Funny People"" ends with a couple of conventional but satisfying scenes and were glad to have spent time----if a little too much time---with George and Ira and all their comedy friends. Sandler gives one of his best performances as a talented narcissist who knows full well he sold out so long ago it might be impossible to achieve any kind of career or personal redemption and the young cast is uniformly sharp and witty. Were also treated to self-effacing cameos from Sarah Silverman Paul Reiser Ray Romano and yes Eminem. Apatow has written a rich touching clever ribald sprawling comedy----and it appears as if he decided to film every scene in the script pacing and flow be damned. I still think it would have been a better film with a running time of two hours but ""Funny People"" the directors cut is one of my favorite movies so far this year.

Photo Credit AP Photo/Universal Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A famous but unhappy comedian takes a struggling stand-up comic under his wing. BOTTOM LINE A long and somewhat lumpy comedy-drama that will test tailbone and funny bone alike. CAST Adam Sandler Seth Rogen Leslie Mann Eric Bana. DIRECTOR Judd Apatow LENGTH 225 From Jerry Lewis to Woody Allen comedians have a long history of wanting to make serious films. Its no surprise that Judd Apatow (""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" ""Knocked Up"") would make his bid with ""Funny People"" but what is surprising is how far this talented and (until now) infallible writer-director falls from his goal. Actually three movies packed into one ""Funny People"" begins with Adam Sandler (Apatows one-time roommate) playing a version of himself named George Simmons. His blockbuster career is interrupted by a diagnosis of leukemia and its no joke After getting the news Simmons wanders through his Los Angeles mansion alone and friendless. advertisement | advertise on newsday In the second movie one that Apatow has made before several dudes pass the time insulting and cherishing each other. Leo (Jonah Hill) Mark (a very good Jason Schwartzman) and Ira (Seth Rogen) are trying to break into show biz (and score chicks) with mixed success. Things start looking up for Ira however when Simmons spots him in a club. An unexpectedly close friendship soon forms between the have and the have-not. Simmons even drags Ira along as he tries to steal an ex-girlfriend Laura (Leslie Mann Apatows wife) from her jovial husband Clarke (Eric Bana in rare high spirits). But once this third movie begins the loose skein of ""Funny People"" completely unravels. Apatows glimpses behind the brick wall of stand-up feel authentic; parts of the film actually come from Sandlers pre-fame youth. But ""Funny People"" veers wildly in tone and style with jarring cameos (Ray Romano Eminem) and a third act that mimics one of John Cassavetes improvised experiments. Apatow may deserve to be taken seriously but for now hes still kidding around.

"Funny People | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; funny-people ) Funny People (United States 2009) July 29 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Its written and directed by Judd Apatow and stars Adam Sandler and Seth Rogan so it must be funny right? The problem with expectations is that they can lead to disappointment. Thats not to say Funny People is devoid of humor - in fact there are some genuinely funny bits sprinkled throughout. However Funny People represents an attempt by Apatow to broaden the real estate of the orifice into which he has become pigeonholed. His previous two directorial efforts The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up have frequently been labeled as ribald romantic comedies - films whose sweet cores are hidden by copious layers of profanity and frank sexual discourse. Funny People is a different sort of movie because its more of a drama and an uncomfortable one at that than it is a comedy. Any relationships whether male/female romances or male/male bonding are secondary to Apatows fascination with the travails of a misanthrope who is living under a death sentence. The movie will challenge Apatow fans and Sandler devotees. Its a brave move that is partially undone by pacing problems and a lack of focus. Despite having obviously been cut to bring down the running length Funny People still clocks in at nearly 2 1/2 hours and thats too long for these characters to sustain audience interest. The movie wears thin its welcome a couple of reels before Apatow has finished telling his story. Movie star and stand-up comedian George Simmons (Adam Sandler) is an unpleasant sort of person who becomes even more self-absorbed when he is told that the rare blood disorder from which he suffers will soon claim his life. George is stunned by this news and isnt sure how to absorb it. He tries calling Laura (Leslie Mann) the one true love of his life who dumped him more than a decade ago after he slept with another woman but all he can manage are a few lame apologies. Then he decides to debut a new dark standup routine on an unsuspecting audience. Thats where he meets Ira (Seth Rogan) a would-be comedian who is in awe of this living legend. George who is either desperately lonely or genuinely impressed by Iras material (or a combination thereof) offers Ira a job as his personal assistant/joke writer. Its too good a position to refuse. But George is not the good-natured guy he appears to be from afar and Ira gets a close-up view of a self-centered individual who would ruin a marriage for personal satisfaction. Apatow is an expert juggler when it comes to tone and thematic content but he has too many balls in the air here. The comedy is uneven. Some of the stand-up scenes are painfully unfunny. (Does anyone think James Taylor saying ""Fuck Facebook"" to an audience of MySpace shareholders is worthy of more than halfhearted chuckle?) A lot of these routines remind me of how little boys think four-letter words are hilarious. For adults however a string of profanity in and of itself is not funny; the humor comes from how its set up and employed. There are times when the stand-up scenes dont get this. On the other hand theres some very funny stuff to be found in the movie. Theres the scene in which Sandler and Rogan confront the ""Die Hard doctor."" Sandler has some stinging one-liners and theres a brilliant scene featuring cameos by Eminem and Ray Romano. (""Doesnt everyone love you?"") Overall however Funny People is pretty grim. Not only is it wearying to spend 2 1/2 hours in the company of a bipolar self-absorbed creep but the story is told in a choppy uneven manner. For a while it appears that Funny People will balance things out between George and Ira. For the first half of the movie Ira holds Georges hand and becomes his only friend as he copes with his mortality. Some time is spent developing Iras character - hes given a love interest (Aubrey Plaza) and two roommates (Jonah Hill Jason Schwartzman). Theres a buddy vibe. Then things are suddenly all about George and Laura re-kindling their long-dormant love with Ira being shunted to one side held in reserve to baby-sit Lauras kids and spearhead the contrivance that allows the movie to arrive at the climactic confrontation that brings everything to a head. Being long-winded is not a new problem for Apatow. Both of his previous movies were longer than they needed to be and they were then stretched further on DVD by the inclusion of deleted material. Funny People exceeds the extended editions of The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up by nearly15 minutes and theres more that could have been added. Some of the connective tissue is missing (such as the explanation for why Laura who is angry and dismissive during her first conversation with George agrees to see him upon learning hes sick - or how she even finds out about this since theres no public announcement). Funny People is in desperate need of some tightening. Theres some good material here but the movie also rambles a lot. There are times when it doesnt seem sure where its going and isnt in a hurry to get there. Kudos to Adam Sandler who has resurrected and refined the character he portrayed in Punch-Drunk Love. This is another indication that Sandler is becoming restless appearing in the moronic comedies that have become his signature. He is capable of more and movies like this give him a chance to show it. George is dislikeable and his near-death experience does not reveal some great cosmic truth. He has moments of humanity and these allow him to be more than a caricature but this is not a man one can trust or rely upon. Sandler often plays unpleasant individuals with some element of decency beneath the surface. In a way George is a variation on a theme - take the usual Sandler persona and remove the ""decency"" and this is the result. Audiences rebelled to see that in Punch-Drunk Love and the reaction may be similar here. Maybe theres enough low-brow humor and profanity to keep certain elements of Sandlers core group interested. After shocking audiences with his no-holds barred interpretation of a vile mall security guard in Observe and Report Seth Rogan is back in more familiar territory although the movie does his character a disservice by setting Ira up to be a co-equal to George then relegating him to supporting duties for the second half. Leslie Mann Apatows wife is given a more substantive role than the one she had in Knocked Up although its questionable whether this portrayal will answer questions about misogynistic undertones some have detected in Apatows films. Mann and Apatows daughters play the offspring of Laura and her always-traveling husband Clarke (Eric Bana). Aubrey Plaza is underused as Iras would-be girlfriend Daisy. (This subplot deserves considerably more screen time than it is accorded.) And Jonah Hill and Jason Schwartzman represent Iras wisecracking friends/roommates - a staple ingredient in Apatow films. Funny Peoples tone is odd as if George Carlin had script doctored a screenplay written by Ingmar Bergman. Its not inherently uninteresting but it can be off-putting and the films indefensible length turns what could have been an intriguing experiment into something that too often feels like an endurance contest. In the end Apatow cant quite bring all the elements together. The last film that left me conflicted and believing there was something good to be found in the debris was Cameron Crowes Elizabethtown. Its refreshing to see Apatow branching out and trying something off the beaten path but in this case his sense of ambition may have caused him to lose his way.

Literally.Tracy Bennett A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - After devoting his first two films as director The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up to getting laid and having kids respectively Judd Apatow brings the circle of life to a close with Funny People which stars Adam Sandler as George Simmons a popular Sandler-esque movie star diagnosed with a rare and potentially fatal form of leukemia. When actors and directors start thinking outside of themselves and start worrying about how to get more respect or be taken capital-s seriously its almost always a recipe for disaster. Mercifully Funny People is probably the least bathetic self-pitying movie about death and dying to come out of Hollywood since Albert Brookss Defending Your Life. When he receives his diagnosis George doesnt sit around feeling sorry for himself or set out on some inspirational quest to do everything he ever wanted to do before he dies or any of the other things people in movies tend to do in these situations. Instead like probably most of the people you and I know who have faced similar bad news he resolves to fight this thing the best he can and get on with the business of living.Thats not to say that George doesnt go through his share of denial anger bargaining and depression en route to accepting his condition. Theres a great discomfiting scene early on--one that begs to be pushed even further--in which he lapses into a dark stream-of-consciousness riff during a stand-up set at the famous Comedy amp; Magic Club in Hermosa Beach leaving the audience uncertain about whether or not they should laugh. After George implodes a twentysomething actor and comic named Ira Wright (Seth Rogen) takes the stage and makes light of Georges gloom winning laughs for doing so. Later when the comics meet up in the parking lot George tells Ira he would have done the same thing when he was his age and eventually asks him to come write jokes for him.So the world of the dying comedy legend intersects with that of the hungry up-and-comers--not just Ira but his roommates Leo (Jonah Hill) another aspiring actor-writer and Mark (Jason Schwartzman) a hilariously pompous pretty-boy actor who has recently landed the lead in a not-very-good high school sitcom. Apatow clearly knows a lot about the competitiveness and petty rivalries of showbiz people desperate to get their foot in the door and the Hollywood scenes in Funny People remind you how soft and self-congratulatory the ones are in most other movies. Ira whom Rogen plays as a dithering mixture of Sancho Panza and a nervous Jewish mother realizes that George is his big break and Apatow shows us his willingness to exploit his close proximity to a famous person--dying or not--for all its worth. And there are other things Apatow observes so well yet so indirectly that you wonder if people who havent lived in L.A. and known people like these characters will fully appreciate them.In fact theres so much thats so disarmingly good and sharp about Funny People that you wish the whole movie werent so much of a shambles. Ive seen the film twice and both times exactly halfway into its two-and-a-half-hour running time I have felt the cabin shudder and noticed tiny fissures forming in the fuselage. Thats at the point in the movie when George goes in for a checkup and learns that the experimental drugs he has been taking seem to be working and that he may no longer be dying after all. ""Get back to your life"" the doctor intones and the rest of Funny People is about Georges dawning realization that he doesnt much like the life he had before socializing with celebrity pseudo-friends (cue raft of cameos from Sarah Silverman Eminem et al.) and perambulating his giant Xanadu-like mansion surrounded by mountains of useless swag. So he decides to reconnect with his ex-girlfriend Laura (Leslie Mann the real-life Mrs. Apatow) whom he cheated on 12 years earlier and who now has a new life with a businessman husband (Eric Bana) and two young daughters (played by Apatows own kids Maude and Iris).Its hard enough for a movie to withstand the introduction of a whole set of major characters past the point when most movies are wrapping things up and its even harder when those characters feel so incongruous to everything that has come before. On one hand Laura and her brood should seem incongruous to George and his solitary life but the feeling is one of unintentional mismatch. When George and Laura have their first big scene together it doesnt feel like these two people have a whole shared history together and this is even less apparent in Manns scenes with Bana. Apatow has been accused of not writing good parts for women--unfairly I think because Catherine Keeners in The 40-Year-Old Virgin was that rare smart and sexy role for a woman over 40 in a major Hollywood movie. But here the accusation sticks Lauras inner life hasnt been thought out nearly as well as that of George Ira and all the other guy parts and the character ultimately becomes a cog in a series of third-act plot machinations that betray the organic feel of the earlier scenes.Apatows obvious model here is Terms of Endearment and Broadcast News director James L. Brooks who gets a thanks in the end credits and whose last two films As Good As It Gets and Spanglish were as phony through and through as Funny People is in its lesser moments. But where Apatow falls short of Brooks is in his desire to redeem all his characters to forgive even the worst behavior and to send everyone--on-screen and in the audience--home happy. A movie that strives to convey the depth of feeling and the range of emotions that Funny People so clearly does badly needs at least one moment of cruelty comparable to the fake tears of William Hurts reporter in Broadcast News or the betrayal of Nick Noltes over-the-hill film star by a bubbly young assistant in Ill Do Anything. Apatow has plenty of opportunities but the closest he comes--a scene in which George callously checks his cell phone while Laura is held tearfully rapt by a family home video--makes only a softball impact (though it might have made a bigger one had we felt there was more at stake for the characters). For a movie with countless dick jokes and in which the final clearly audible word of dialogue is ""balls"" you wish that Apatows own cojones were a wee bit bigger.

Its ? the rest of us who are left out of Funny People Judd Apatows furiously anguished -- and? at 145 unshaped minutes quantifiably endless -- tragi-comedy about a sad showbiz clown and his ilk. Of course characters and dramas built around the anger that fuels the funny constitute a venerable black-humor subgenre W.C. Fields reveled in the muck and the jolting movies The King of Comedy and The Entertainer made art out of the emotional contradictions of professional comics. But Funny People is a less successful stab at explaining jerks who make jokes. The movie deeply personal to its maker is too self-?absorbed to convey effectively the emotional complexity that Apatow has in mind. The message that comes across is Were all screwed and then we die. Ba-DUM. Adam Sandler plays George Simmons a comedy superstar whose comfortable routines of swinging-bachelor affluence (interrupted only by high fives from adoring fans) are upended when hes diagnosed with a malignant blood disease. Not funny Theres nothing like a fatal illness to harsh a mellow even in sunny California. And Sandler works the territory with the same fascinating intensity and daring disregard for likability he brought? to his great work in the anti-funny Punch-Drunk Love. Lonely and vulnerable George plucks Ira (Seth Rogen) a struggling up-and-coming comic to be his assistant. His joke writer. His paid-companion-to-sit-with-him-while-he-falls-asleep. All of the above. The ailing star also asks Ira to invite Iras roommates and fellow comedians (Jason Schwartzman and Jonah Hill) to write material for George too. But Ira doesnt convey that part of the news Maybe hes annoyed because as played by the newly trim Rogen the character is required to endure his pals tedious jokes about his healthy physique as if he broke the rules of the schlub club. Funny People is like that Men who are at ease with comedy and uneasy in life behave badly selfishly and inconsistently in sickness and in health. (Even when his prognosis brightens George retains the symptoms of a schmuck.) But guys arent the only losers in Apatows cosmos. As Laura the love of Georges life who left? him years ago to marry a better nonshowbiz type (a funny feisty hotcha Eric Bana -- ?good for Laura) and raise an adorable family Leslie Mann dutifully represents all women who have ever loved a charming unreliable guy and given up while waiting for him to ripen. Laura is a thankless role to play -- shes her own kind of flighty cuckoo -- but at least shes allowed to be a married adult.? The only other female of any consequence is Daisy (newcomer Aubrey Plaza) a deadpan girl comic in the mordant Janeane Garofalo mode. In a twisted take on postfeminism Daisy stands by her right to sleep with famous men simply because theyre famous. To promote Funny People Universal is pushing the angle that Apatow who wrote and directed The 40 Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up is one of todays most pop-culturally attuned dramatists specializing in the funny anxieties of talkative boy-men. (Said anxieties include sex women commitment adulthood regular working hours and societally mandated norms of hygiene.) The come-on is that the movie assembles a great party of popular actors who have become famous by associating with Apatow -- among them Rogen Mann and Hill -- and then raises the stakes Look its Sandler grand master of a parallel school of boy-man comedy in the lifelike leading role of a rich and famous star For a kick other famous comedians (e.g. Paul Reiser Sarah Silverman Ray Romano) and one famous rap musician from Detroit (Eminem) appear as themselves. But the stars twinkle like distractions. And in his long sobering story without a punchline Judd Apatow confounds three crowds traditional Sandler fans expecting goofy sweetness Virgin/Knocked Up boosters hoping for raunchy fun and connoisseurs of movies however offbeat that know (as professional funny people say) how to kill.

Funny People Good Director Judd Apatow. Cast Adam Sandler Seth Rogen Leslie Mann Rating Rated R for language and crude sexual humor throughout and some sexuality. Related Judd Apatow turns serious Spotlight Adam Sandler Spotlight Seth Rogen Movies about comedians So what would happen if he put that heart right out front? Youd get ""Funny People"" his latest film that spares none of the raunch - you will hear more penis jokes in the first 10 minutes than you have in your whole life (unless evidently you run in Apatows crowd) - but successfully tackles more mature themes than he has before. Adam Sandler with whom Apatow once lived plays George Simmons a famous comic whos made millions from a string of bad movies much like . . . Adam Sandler. George pads around in his mansion rich but lonely. He accommodates fans with picture requests and such but doesnt really seem to connect with anyone. Then he learns he may be dying. He suffers from a rare form of leukemia and the prognosis isnt good. He does a downer of a surprise stand-up set at a club where hes followed by struggling - as in sleeps-on-friends-sofa works-in-a-grocery-story-deli struggling - comic Ira Wright (Seth Rogen) who rips George onstage for being so morose. The next day George hires Ira to write jokes for him be his assistant pal around with him - basically to be his friend. He doesnt have many. ""Youre my closest friend and I dont even like you"" he tells Ira and its not really a joke. Its quite a step up for Ira who lives with his friends Leo (Jonah Hill) and Mark (Jason Schwartzman) the former a comic with promise the latter the star of a dreadful sitcom. Their easy profane camaraderie busting each other at every turn while they compete for success is something George once had but lost. He gets a measure of it back with Ira though his mood can swing suddenly from friendly to almost abusive. The sweet-natured Ira plays along. Something else George lost along the way to superstardom was Laura (Leslie Mann Apatows real-life wife). Shes now married to a hot-headed Australian (Eric Bana) with whom she has two daughters (played by Apatow and Manns children) and lives with in Northern California. Their break-up was bitter but news of Georges illness causes her to get back in touch with him. Its here that ""Funny People"" begins to run into trouble. While the relationships between the men feel natural and genuine Apatow isnt quite sure how to make George and Laura convincingly reconnect. An ill-timed visit to her home by George and Ira certainly thickens the plot but too much. And while there are some huge laughs in this segment (as in the rest of the film) it goes on way too long taking away from the most-interesting relationship in the film that between George and Ira. Apatow gets back to that eventually but by this time hes stalled the momentum and cant get it back making a film thats too long already (the running time is almost two-and-a-half hours) seem longer still. Yet whats good about ""Funny People"" is really good and that starts with Sandler whos outstanding. Hes fascinating as George funny enough but unafraid to show an ugly narcissistic side that prevents him from getting too close to anyone. Rogen meanwhile may be the most comfortable presence in comedies today. He doesnt just seem like someone youd like to hang out with. He seems like someone you have hung out with so familiar now is his easy delivery. Apatow enlists a whos who of the comedy world for cameos but the funniest line in the movie may belong to singer James Taylor. And thats saying something because there are a lot of funny lines. Theres a lot of heart as well. You just wish that there wasnt such a big lot of everything that Apatow had the discipline to pare things down.

"movie review funny people funny people movie review adam sandler judd apatow - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Funny People -- 3 out of 5 stars Adam Sandler Eric Bana and Seth Rogen Universal Universal Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Funny People is a comedy at the apex of Judd Apatows ambitions and the outer limits of Adam Sandlers talent. An overlong and rambling riff on stand-ups who struggle to ""make it"" in movies or TV it psychoanalyzes the insecure folks who make us laugh.And in those many dead spots in between the sometimes funny stage routines and cliched psycho-truths about comics Apatow and Sandler struggle to be sentimental. All funny people want is to be loved to not live alone in that big Beverly Hills mansion that is the finish line theyre all sprinting toward. Its meant to be his ""big statement."" But 40-Year Old Virgin was funnier and deeper. Ex-Apatow roommate Sandler stars as George Simmons a lonely sell-out who made his mark with brainless comedies such as Re-Do (a man who becomes a baby again) and made his millions along the way.Now hes been diagnosed with a terminal illness and he has no one to tell no one to pass his car collection on to. George slips out to the stand-up clubs where he got his start. ""Whos going to amuse you when Im gone?"" he croons to clueless audiences. When he takes on Ira a struggling comic (Seth Rogen well-cast) as his assistant the stage is set for George to re-connect with his humanity and maybe win back the now-married girl (Leslie Mann terrific) he lost. Or not.Apatows credo here is the one Larry David brought to Seinfeld -- ""No learning."" Ira may morph into a better performer but George -- despite flashes of sweetness -- is like most of us. He doesnt ""grow."" Man-child Sandler would be well-suited for the part if it didnt require acting.The best scenes are the one-upmanship duels among three friends -- the struggling Ira his destined-to-make-it peer Leo (Jonah Hill a hoot) and the guy on his way Mark (Jason Schwartzman) earning big bucks in a terrible sitcom.The third act is a domestic melodrama that George (and Ira) dive into. While that gives Mann (Mrs. Apatow) and Eric Bana a chance to score laughs as a feuding couple who push each others buttons it drags. Casting generations of real comics as peers only reminds us that Jerry Seinfelds documentary Comedian got to this subject earlier and better. Funny People isnt a bad movie its an indifferent one. No funny person wants to hear that.Funny PeopleThree of five starsCast Adam Sandler Seth Rogen Leslie Mann Eric Bana Jonah HillDirector Judd ApatowRunning time 2 hours 25 minutesIndustry rating R for language and crude sexual humor throughout and some sexuality.

Plus the years best caper flick is a documentary. By David Edelstein Published Jul 26 2009 ShareThis (Photo Tracy Bennett/Courtesy of Universal Pictures) Its hard to believe that Judd Apatows sour maudlin Funny People is only the third film he has directed. His man-child universe with its mixture of juvenile raunch and white-bread family values has conquered American comedy. But this film is meant to be an advance Apatows first grown-up movie. That man-child protagonist is now in his late forties and facing death and has never had a mature relationshipnever made a commitment. George Simmons (Adam Sandler) a stand-up comedian turned dumb-comedy movie star is diagnosed with a fatal cancer and copes by returning to his old club haunts and baffling people with sardonic free-associations. He picks up a youthful protege Ira Wright (Seth Rogen) whos meant to be the stand-in for us mortals in the audience flattered by access to celebrity and dazzled by its perks (private planes women) but increasingly appalled by the stars selfishness. Even as the scared and lonely George tries to atone for past misdeeds he radiates entitlement. Sick or well hes dead inside. Playing dead is tricky but Sandler gives it a go. He barely opens his mouth when he talks as if hes too powerful to expend the efforthe knows people will lean in. Hes very touching when he asks Ira to sit by his bed and converse until he falls asleep like a rich baby who can hire someone to coddle him. (He does a good sleepy-baby voice.) Sandler isnt afraid of plumbing his dark side but Apatow fails him Scenes of Georges self-pity drag on too long and as the character loses stature Sandler recedes from his own vehicle. Rogen doesnt fill the vacuum. Hes wrong for the part of the male ingenue He looks pained as if hes laboring to hold his gee-whiz expression in place. It would help if the characters had distinctive worldviews as comedians but their routines have no juice. Iras are all about dick size and Apatow cuts away from Georges just when they start getting interesting. These men arent enlarged by their work; if anything their jokes diminish them and its hard to feel sympathy for people who put so little soul into their work. Apatow has been around L.A. long enough to capture how showbiz males (especially Jewish) compete with one-liners some good most lame many hostile. But the banter between Ira and his more successful apartment-mates (Jason Schwartzman and the tubby Jonah Hill) grows tiresome. Funny People feels insular as if Apatows whole world consists of nerdy jokesters who were angry lonely kids who got rich beyond their dreams and fucked women whod never have talked to them in high school but are deep down still angry. Apatow transcended all thatand wants us to know itby marrying Leslie Mann who was hilarious as Katherine Heigls acid sister in Knocked Up and here gets quite the pedestal. She plays Laura the one that got away from George and married an Australian businessman (Eric Bana). Apatow lingers on her bright eyes and darling overbite and sweet little bod but he hasnt given her any good lines or an interesting subtext so whats the point? Its a waste of a precious resource. Lauras children are played by Apatow and Manns daughters Maude and Iris and the casting tips you off to the fate of George and Lauras rekindled romance Even translated into fiction Apatow would hardly break up his own family. George has to become a dull schmuck to conform to Apatows moral agenda. Even with famous comics and musicians showing up for cameos Funny People has no snap; it droops under the weight of that agenda. Its few lively scenes feature Bana whos skinny but wiry his Aussie bonhomie bristling with menace. Aubrey Plaza has one or two moments as a cute female comedian with big glasses and a glassy demeanor that seemsgiven all the overbearing mensensibly self-protective. But why dont we see her onstage? Apatows comedy could use a female perspective. Funny People is so full of morbid male self-attention that when its over you expect to see crusty brown stains all over the screen. Park Chan-Wook director of the Korean art-gore vampire movie Thirst has a gaze thats weighty and impassive even when hes showering you with riotously yucko carnage and death. You laughbut also register the emotional gravity the extremes to which humans can be pushed. This time he opens on a religious note. The likable Song Kang-ho plays a priest so depressed by peoples depressions he volunteers as a test subject for a new vaccine. After his skin shrivels and a geyser of blood erupts from his mouth he diesand is resurrected by a transfusion. At first it seems he has been reborn to heal the sick but it emerges hes just a vampirea nice vampire who doesnt kill people. The first sign this is an over-the-top Park movie is when hes under the bed of an obese man in an irreversible coma sucking blood through a tube. The sound is to die for loud slurpy very liquid. A vampire film with a pacifist vampire can get boring so hes swept into an affair with the traumatized young wife (Kim Ok-vin) of a childhood friend. Will he kill her allegedly abusive husband? Make her his undead bride? For all his noble intentions the blood is about to hit the fan. 1 2 Next Share this story...

Candid but long-winded well observed but undisciplined ""Funny People"" feels like Judd Apatows diploma picture marking his move from high school to college as a filmmaker. Amusing and engaging yet lacking in snap and cohesion this insiders look at the world of standup comics in contempo Los Angeles rings true in its view of the variously warped stunted and narrow lives of its mostly male denizens. Adam Sandlers central performance as some version of himself is notable for its revelation of callowness and ambivalent self-regard which will fascinate some fans and turn off others. Curiosity should spur a healthy opening with likely widely divergent reactions suggesting questionable staying power. Although Apatows name seems to have been on the majority of the comedies made in the past four years Universal is pushing the auteur angle by stressing that this is just his third film as a director. After the raunchy antics of ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"" hes gone half-serious here serving up Sandlers fictional equivalent George Simmons as a 40ish comic superstar who learns he has a rare and possibly fatal disease. This seems like a setup for a tiresomely typical Hollywood story in which a self-absorbed celebrity learns through crisis that theres more to life than fame and success. To the contrary; Apatows handling of the illness issue is one of the best things about the picture in that its underplayed entirely unsentimental and quite blunt in answering a central question If George were to get a miraculous medical reprieve would he continue being an arrogant a-hole? Maybe. ""Funny People"" is about individuals -- mostly young physically unprepossessing Jewish horndoggy guys -- who try to make a living being funny. The film is outstanding at observing the interplay and competitiveness among three roommates Leo (Jonah Hill) a tubby and belligerent performer and writer; Mark (Jason Schwartzman) the painfully self-serious star of a lame TV comedy; and Ira (a now entirely slimmed-down Seth Rogen) an aspiring standup whose life and career take major turns when he starts writing material for George. Like their mostly below-the-belt stage monologues the guys conversation is largely rude and crude. Ira who takes no end of abuse from George about the fact that he changed his last name from Weiner never gets anyone in the sack and becomes irate when an offbeat scenester girl he likes Daisy (Aubrey Plaza) casually gets it on with Mark. George lives in an extraordinary mansion above the Pacific and invites Ira into his life up to a point. Frank about the perks of stardom where women are concerned he is similarly blunt about other aspects of his life. ""I used to be excited"" he confesses a mountain of unread scripts piled on his countertop later adding that someone like him has plenty of people to hang out with but no real friends. The picture bobs along very nicely for 85 minutes or so engaging smiles and interest with its behind-the-scenes looks at the comedy club culture the bull sessions that produce new material the way comics test themselves and each other their sensitivities and jealousies. When George gets some unexpectedly positive medical news he celebrates with pals at the Palm occasioning some amusing cameos from Paul Reiser Sarah Silverman Ray Romano and Eminem among others. But theres still nearly an hour to go most of which leaves the L.A. comedy scene behind in favor of the Marin County manse of Georges old flame Laura (Leslie Mann) a former starlet now married with two daughters. In San Francisco for a shared gig with Ira George allows what was intended as a social call to develop into something more and ultimately becomes embroiled not only with Lauras daughters (Apatow and Manns very cute own sprigs Maude and Iris) but with her volatile Australian husband Clarke (Eric Bana). While it has its moments this long latter stretch drains the picture of what little momentum it had and switches the focus to Laura and her own marital problems which are annoying and not entirely convincing. Beset with persistent disappointment over a thwarted career while living in paradise with lovely kids and a hunky if errant mate shes just not an interesting or even very tolerable character her behavior stemming entirely from confusion panic and emotional impulse. Mann hits all the surface notes but never reveals anything beneath the manic surface. While the film ends up as a grab bag of impressions rather than a fully realized work theres plenty to savor beginning with Sandlers performance. Pic opens with some homemade videos Apatow took of his former roommate making prank calls when they were both aspiring unknowns and samplings of Sandlers subsequent early standup work and parodies of the stars lowbrow comedies both honor and poke fun at the performers achievements. But the many insights into everything from the mans arrogance to his self-derision make you feel youre getting something real here and Sandlers gruff offhand manner combines with his comic alertness to very good effect. Playing a frustrated fellow who never knows if his boss is going to praise him or bite his head off Rogen makes for a fine foil in a performance that like most of the film avoids easy shtick. The comic thesps are completely at home in the milieu while the generally hidden Australian in Bana is exuberantly unleashed here. No doubt hired to provide upgraded visuals for a director not heretofore known for pictorial niceties Janusz Kaminski serves up crisp brightly colored images quite unlike those he usually produces for Steven Spielberg. Soundtrack is dominated by loads of carefully chosen pop tunes.
