Whether true or not its a method Dwayne The Rock Johnson looks also to have adopted in order to flesh out his role as the firm-but-fair American football coach whose everyday banter sounds like hes block-quoting from Triumph of the Will. This familiar sports-prison hybrid sees a surly band of teenage reprobates taken under the wing of their bleeding-heart trainer who firmly believes that the best way to rehabilitate these boys is with plenty of full-contact team sports. While the nub of the story focuses on the Rocks volatile relationship with irksome star quarterback Willie Weathers (Jade Yorker) the film also draws naive parallels between the kids violent on-field antics and the tit-for-tat LA gang slayings that are getting them locked up in the first place. The point-and-click direction from Phil Joanou (best known for his U2 concert doc Rattle and Hum) does little to supply any substance to a yarn that was probably on its last legs to begin with and while it remains thoroughly inoffensive and well-meaning stuff its so jam-packed with genre cliches and recycled ideas (think Coach Carter Bad News Bears Wildcats) that theres nothing you wont have seen thought or heard before.

Comments Gridiron Gang Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson weeps gentle tears in this sappy sports drama about Sean Porter a probation officer at a Los Angeles juvenile detention facility who turned a collection of teenage felons into a competitive high school football squad. The coachs mother is dying of cancer the kids are all emotionally wounded and the score swells at every opportunity; you have to admire such bleeding-heart tenderness in a conservative genre but as Robert Aldrich proved in The Longest Yard a football movie should be able to hit harder. The end credits are accompanied by clips of Porter from the Emmy-winning documentary Gridiron Gang (1993) which prove that key scenes from this movie were lifted straight from life and that life needs better writers.

"Gridiron Gang | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Review Gridiron Gang John Anderson 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr Kevin Winter/Getty Images September 14 2006 | 1000PM PT ""All inspiration all the time"" is the ethos of ""Gridiron Gang"" a crowd-pleasing uplifting feel-good and not-so-rare hybrid -- the sports/prison movie -- in which Los Angeles gangbangers are taught the virtues of trading violence on the streets for violence on the field. ""All inspiration all the time"" is the ethos of ""Gridiron Gang"" a crowd-pleasing uplifting feel-good and not-so-rare hybrid -- the sports/prison movie -- in which Los Angeles gangbangers are taught the virtues of trading violence on the streets for violence on the field. Auds will respond either to the uplifting message and the solid action sequences. Or theyll simply wither under the power of the Rocks stentorian delivery of writer Jeff Maguires motivational lines each of which should be accompanied by a rimshot. Compared with the Rock Charlton Hestons Moses was Wallace Shawn. But the Rocks reality-based character Sean Porter (""Gridiron Gang"" is based on the 1993 documentary of the same name) has his hands full. Disillusioned by the 75% recidivism rate at the juvenile correctional detention center where he spends his days keeping kids from killing each other Porter decides to put together a football team. However the team has no real facilities no uniforms no opponents and no support not even from Porters colleagues (Leon Rippy and Kevin Dunn). The kids for that matter dont really want to play. But Porter is determined. And when he says run wind sprints people ask ""How fast?"" D.p. Jeff Cutters shooting gives a muscular authenticity to the camp where members of warring gangs are kept in dangerously close proximity; and to the playing field where the once-troubled youth find their way into self-awareness and teamwork. The process isnt without its hitches In their first game Porters team the Mustangs are humiliated and Porter humiliates himself by losing his cool and berating his players who for all their street-toughness cant handle loss of face. The football program teeters but small victories ensure that boys will become men and the coach will become a leader. A good looking film and a well-executed production ""Gridiron Gang"" spends little time getting down to business -- the first 20 minutes include a drive-by shooting near-assassination domestic killing several assaults and the sense that the gang warfare outside could erupt inside at any minute. Director Phil Joanou (""State of Grace"" ""Heavens Prisoners"") has a fine story to work with and the Rock is a charismatic presence but no one seems confident enough in the material or the audience to allow anything natural to occur. Each little triumph is greeted like the arrival of the wheel and Porter comes across as a little bit Placido Domingo and a little bit Dr. Phil. The supporting players are uniformly fine particularly Jade Yorker and David Thomas as Willie and Kelvin whose enmity as opposing gang members melts just as the Mustangs cohere as a team. Xzibit is notable as Porters assistant; he gives a measured performance thats a welcome antidote to so much overstatement of motivation and message.

Parents will no doubt be grateful for a G-rated movie whose message is about perseverance. And young children are likely to enjoy the epic journey undertaken by an ordinary 10-year-old boy. That this is also the film that Christopher Reeve was working on at the time of his death adds to the poignancy of the message about endurance. His widow Dana Reeve who died in March voices the role of the mother adding to the bittersweet back story. ""Just keep swinging"" is the mantra of Yankee Irving (Jake T. Austin) a scrawny kid taunted by bullies who embarks on a thousand-mile quest to return a bat stolen from his hero Babe Ruth. Irvings father (Mandy Patinkin) is a maintenance worker in Yankee Stadium and on a night when his son comes to visit him the Babes lucky bat disappears. His dad is fired but Irving is sure he knows who took the bat. Irving is accompanied on his odyssey by a talking baseball (Rob Reiner). Along the way he meets up with a feisty girl (Raven-Symone) and shares a rousing ride on a bus with a Negro League team. Irving takes the journey mostly to get his father his job back. That he will also reunite Babe Ruth with his beloved bat Darlin (Whoopi Goldberg) adds to the excitement. The animation is lackluster (especially when compared with dazzlers like Cars or Finding Nemo) the voice talent is serviceable and the writing ho-hum. The films climactic moment far-fetched as it is is touching. Its hard to be unmoved by this all-American wish-fulfillment fantasy. It feels churlish to be nit-picky about movies that have their hearts so assuredly in the right place. But once the genre is undertaken it is the rare filmmaker who can resist the temptation to be formulaic predictable and cliched. Such is also the case with Gridiron Gang based on a true story about juvenile offenders who transcend their criminal backgrounds and gang affiliations and band together to form a football team. The best thing about Gridiron Gang is the performance of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. He is engaging affable and wholly believable as a former football star turned officer in a juvenile detention center. Johnsons character is disillusioned by the fact that 75% of the inmates when released end up back in prison or dying on the mean streets they grew up on. He figures teaching kids discipline and teamwork just might keep them out of trouble. And since this is based on a true story we learn his instincts are right. Riveting football sequences save some of the movie from its trite leanings. Gridiron entertains and makes a powerful point about the faults inherent in the penal system particularly for youths with hopes of rehabilitation.

Starring Dwayne Johnson Xzibit Leon Rippy and Kevin Dunn. Directed by Phil Joanou. (PG-13 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) A savage beat-down or a revenge killing never seems very far away in ""Gridiron Gang"" a sports movie thats nearly as bleak as it is uplifting. Maybe thats because it was filmed on a field a few yards away from real-life incarcerated teens at Camp Kilpatrick in Los Angeles. Audiences expecting another ""Remember the Titans"" or ""Glory Road"" will find this football story more challenging but also more rewarding. With a tone that combines ""Friday Night Lights"" and ""Stand and Deliver"" the movie succeeds as a crowd-pleaser without glossing over the complicated roots of gang violence. ""Gridiron Gang"" is most notable as a starring vehicle for Dwayne Johnson also known as The Rock. (The ex-wrestlers profile takes up about 83 percent of the movie poster.) Johnson plays Sean Porter a real-life probation officer who started a detention center football team called the Mustangs in the 1990s and persuaded prison officials to let it compete against high school teams in the San Fernando Valley. Rolling in at an exhaustive two hours ""Gridiron Gang"" has three or four too many motivational speeches by Johnson and a few scenes that border on lunacy. If everything that happened in this movie took place in real life the result would be about 150 lawsuits. Too many of the sports scenes are cliched including the obligatory overweight-but-sassy cheerleading squad and one touchdown pulled straight from the playbook of ""The Program."" But the film treats most of its characters honestly with a lot of subtle moments that you wont find in many mainstream films -- especially ones that star The Rock. When star running back and gang-banger Willie Weathers (Jade Yorker) gets tackled into the sideline at the rich kids school director Phil Joanou finds the right camera angle and milks the moment -- showing Weathers looking in wonder at the cheerleaders and players with their expensive uniforms. He might as well be on the moon. Johnson also shows how far hes come since his nearly wordless appearance five years ago as the Scorpion King in ""The Mummy Returns."" His character shows some of the same flaws as his teammates which come out when Porter loses control in their first game and later shares a quiet moment with a gang-banger who regrets a noble decision that might get him killed. The movie advocates giving young criminals a chance to find the good in themselves which by definition will be controversial. Many of the characters in ""Gridiron Gang"" are murderers. Its noticeable that the writers never explore what the families of their victims think about their privilege to play football. But the movie does show realities of prison reform that you wont get from other mainstream movies including the steps that lead to recidivism and the importance of positive role models waiting outside the prison walls. Dont be scared away by the subject matter. While its about 14 times grittier than your typical Disney flick (the amount of profanity and gun violence pushes the PG-13 rating) the ratio of feel-good moments per hour is equal to ""Rudy"" or ""The Rookie"" or any other Hollywood sports movie. The difference is ""Gridiron Gang"" gives you a lot more to think about during the ride home. -- Advisory This film contains profanity fighting gun violence and one really nasty catfight between the Mustangs cheerleaders.

The Rock plays coach to troubled young athletes in Gridiron Gang. Photo Columbia Pictures Gridiron Gang 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Thirteen. Thats the number of times that Dwayne the Rock"" Johnson preaches to his charges in Gridiron Gang. The movie is a strenuously inspirational sports drama based on the true story of a Los Angeles juvenile corrections facility that fielded a high school football team in the face of crushing odds. And this bakers dozen includes locker-room pep talks and sideline harangues sideline pep talks and locker-room harangues plus one or two jail-cell scoldings that combine fortissimo screamfests with bootstrap pleas for self-improvement. So loud and so many are these sermons that at one point Johnson goes hoarse. Cant blame him; its in the script. And he plays it with big-gun dramatic zeal. Johnson is Sean Porter a probation officer at Camp Kilpatrick detention center where convicted young killers drug dealers and car thieves bide their time before being released back onto the streets to kill deal steal or die. Many are South Central teenagers from rival gangs. Behind bars they get into fights and barely avoid strangling each other. This grim state of affairs leads Porter to found a football squad -- the Mustangs -- on the belief that lost boys need a grounding in teamwork. He does so over the doubts of his bosses whom he snows and the strutting mulishness of his players whom he quickly puts to work Willie (Jade Yorker) who shot his mothers boyfriend; Bates (Trever OBrien) who jacked a Nissan; Kelvin (David V. Thomas) who has it in for Willie. Coach tells them theyre Mustangs now and Mustangs are winners. Mustangs dont give up. Mustangs have heart. When coach isnt preaching hes at the side of his dying mother who doles out her own wisdom and tells him hes a star. His pep talks alternate with hers through most of the movie interrupting the action like hailstorms of Hallmark greeting cards. During the films rare pep-free moments young men run toward end zones accompanied by ecstatic brass crescendos. This lazy and episodic tacking (pep talk game pep talk game) aggravated me because it sabotages the films social relevance and honest-to-goodness cinematic uplift. If ever a story needed telling its this one According to the movies prologue three out of four juvenile inmates wind up back behind bars or dead. The statistics for recidivism shock and sober and in its best scenes so does Gridiron Gang There are bolts of tragedy shivers of hope and glancing blows of humor along with words of such plain-spoken regret that the young men uttering them wilt with longing. But we spend too little time with the inmates too much on Porters harangues. Directed by Phil Joanou (Heavens Prisoners Rattle amp; Hum)Gridiron Gang was written by Jeff Maguire from an identically titled 1993 documentary. That film is excerpted at the end of this one treating viewers to a few clips of the nonfiction coach and his nonfiction players -- a technique also used by Invincible the years other feel-good fact-based football movie. The effect is surreal. The real-world Sean Porter isnt some smoothly handsome hunk of Rock (amen after all these years to see a white role filled by a person of color) but a rather blunt-looking man with ... a knack for pep talks. Listen closely Those sermons sound awfully familiar. If the Rock goes hoarse in Gridiron Gang hes only being true to his source. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Gillette Silver Blue Razor Blades 100-Pack for 14 + free...

"Gridiron Gang is a contender not a cliche - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Gang is a contender not a cliche By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  September 15 2006 As long as there are young men dying on Americas streets Hollywood will continue to promise that the key to salvation includes basketball spelling or the unstoppable wisdom of Michelle Pfeiffer. Sometimes in the case of last springs neglected ""Akeelah and the Bee"" or ""Gridiron Gang"" which opens today the inspirational hogwash takes a back seat to the realities of the crisis at hand.Good filmmaking and complex characters cut away at the contempt familiarity breeds for based-on-a-true-story tales. And ""Gridiron Gang"" is well enough made to not leave you too terribly rankled when the pallid documentary footage that plays during the closing credits suggests that this healthier-looking football movie appears to be a shot-for-shot remake.Still despite the shameless cutting and pasting its hard to argue with the movies intentions. ``Gridiron Gang"" is set at Camp Kilpatrick a Los Angeles County juvenile detention compound whose delinquents are merely waiting to rejoin their street gangs or resume their lives of petty crime.Having lost his last recidivist gang banger in a drive-by probation officer and former high-school football star Sean Porter (Dwayne ``The Rock"" Johnson) decides to impose the sports discipline on his young charges. The administrators are expectantly resistant (Porter is setting them up to fail goes the argument) and the kids are self-doubting and skeptical. Obviously it all works out the Kilpatrick Mustangs have a pretty good maiden season.But the movies inevitabilities (the humiliating loss the ebb and flow of camaraderie the triumphant finale) have deep resonance. If the actors playing the Kilpatrick residents are tough and charismatic they also have stores of hurt. These are young men who know the odds are against them and not because this is the sort of movie that beats you over the head with grim statistics (although it is just that sort of movie).Porter takes an interest in Willie (Jade Yorker) whose slain cousin was one of Porters old causes while taking time to escort his own gravely ill mother (L. Scott Caldwell) to her hospital appointments. Those developments would leave any other movie feeling hopelessly rigged but this flinty picture needs whatever teary release it can get however cheap. Not that Johnson is immune to feeling. His masculine sensitivity holds the film together.The veteran director Phil Joanou and screenwriter Jeff Maguire refuse to keep the kids outside worlds from intruding on their reasonably safe prison life. Porter and his assistant Malcolm Moore (Xzibit the rapper and host of ``Pimp My Ride"") are paternal saints compared with the inhumanity outside Kilpatrick. The gang bangers we see are like terrorists. Indeed contrary to most uplifting sports dramas street life in this movie is meaner and scarier than any of the football plays.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.
