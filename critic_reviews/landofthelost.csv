Media San Francisco Chronicle Land of the Lost Directed by Brad Silberling. Starring Will Ferrell and Anna Friel. (PG-13. 93 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Land of the Lost"" was a dreadful television show. Those who watched NBC on Saturday mornings may recall its rubberized production values and stultifying dialogue but believe me it was even worse than you remember. (Netflix doesnt lie.) Dreadfulness lowers the bar for any remake a fact exploited by this new expensive totally schnockered Will Ferrellization of the mid-1970s fantasy series. Filmmakers have more license with a bad TV show than a good one even when the new versions producers include the very brothers - Sid and Marty Krofft - who created the old. Everyone it seems was determined to make this big-screen parody as retro-trippy as possible utilizing lizard suits woozy theremin music and scenes that Salvador Dali might have cooked up. The result is eight times as strange and exponentially more potty-mouthed than the original series. Directed by Brad Silberling (""10 Items or Less"") ""Land of the Lost"" starts with roughly the same premise A yellow raft and three intrepid occupants get flushed down a whirlpool into an alternate reality where they meet thundering dinosaurs nattering ape-men and lizardlike bipeds known as Sleestaks. The castaways are still named Marshall Will and Holly. Theres still a T. rex named Grumpy and an ape-boy named Chaka. A reptilian dude named Enik still stands around issuing stentorian directives. Holly (Anna Friel) and Will (Danny McBride) are no longer whiny siblings but a plucky British scientist and a horny denim-encased fireworks salesman. Dr. Rick Marshall (Ferrell) isnt their dad but the disgraced physicist behind the ""tachyon amplifier"" a convoluted thingamajig that opens interdimensional portals and as a bonus plays the original-cast recording of ""A Chorus Line.""

Photo Universal Pictures 2009 Review Land of the Lost is a quirky remake 1 / 6 Back to Gallery This leads Marshall amp; Co. to the terra incognito of the title where extinct species mingle with time-hopping bric-a-brac - an ice cream truck a drive-in theater - in a prehistoric landscape. It also leads to some of the films weirder campier Ferrellian touches such as the bit when Marshall dances past pterodactyl eggs to the tune of ""I Hope I Get It."" This made me laugh; it might make someone else plead for mercy or a refund. Thats how it usually works with Ferrell a practitioner of self-mortifying man-boy absurdism whose exposed hairy belly is as good a metaphor as any for his shtick. If you can stand the midriff you can stand him. The movies wafer-thin plot is just an excuse for Ferrell McBride and Jorma Taccone (as Chaka) to drag out the boob dino pee and narcotic-fruit-juice jokes. Almost every gag is a notch too spacey and a minute too long. -- Advisory Crude and sexual content and for language including a drug reference.

Comments Land of the Lost When youre reviewing a Will Ferrell comedy that involves a dinosaurs giant turd you know the capsules pretty much going to write itself. In this gigantic chunk of scat from Universal Pictures and director Brad Silberling Ferrell plays a scorned scientist who hopes to revive his reputation with a time-travel machine; accompanied by cheeky Anna Friel and mangy Danny McBride he journeys to an alternate reality populated by dinosaurs apelike creatures with severe dental problems and a master race of trudging goggle-eyed lizard men. The 70s TV series Land of the Lost was the last hit for Saturday-morning moguls Sid and Marty Krofft who were still around to produce this feature and are now threatening to revive H.R. Pufnstuff and Sigmund and the Sea Monsters for the big screen. They must be stopped. PG-13 101 min. By J.R.

The marketing angle for this big-screen offering seems to be Will Ferrell plus CGI dinosaurs and bug-eyed aliens in lizard suits equals one big family frolic. The movie however is a ragbag of lackadaisical plotting drugs references puerile lechery and shiny effects work an assemblage far from child-friendly yet not quite grungey enough to wow older teens. Ferrell as the quantum palaeontologist convinced of another dimension where different time periods collide appears close to the Mike Myers tipping point where only the performer himself thinks hes funny. Then again with merely the skeleton crew of scientist Anna Friel (a grim role mainly requiring cleavage) white trash tour-guide Danny McBride and Jorma Taccones grunting groping (said cleavage) prehistoric primate accompanying him into the aforementioned alternate dimension the star turn is left rather exposed by the scripts confounding dearth of laughs. All of which should by rights prove unendurable but once you realise that the movie doesnt have its act together it somehow becomes perversely endearing. While ace production designer Bo Welch struts his stuff in the hallucinatory desert locales strewn with pop culture flotsam and jetsam the story schleps from one cursory action set-piece to another with an almost heroic absence of conviction - playing just like some multi-million-dollar stoner gag at the studios expense. If only it were a lot funnier then wed all be smiling.

""Land of the Lost"" pushes sci-fi/comedy to the edge of PG-13 decorum.  |  1/2 out of 4 stars By Colin Covert Star Tribune June 5 2009 -- 646am Universal Pictures Star Tribune Will Farrell in ""Land of the Lost."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Rowdy trippy and surprisingly raunchy ""Land of the Lost"" pushes sci-fi/comedy to the edge of PG-13 decorum. Its based on a kitschy 1970s live-action childrens series created by Sid and Marty Krofft (creators of ""H.R. Pufnstuf"" and ""Lidsville""). The Kroffts have spent decades denying that they made their loopy special effects-heavy shows under the influence of recreational chemicals. The people behind this leave-your-brains-home film might make the same claim but Im withholding judgment until I see the lab tests. Will Ferrell stars as Dr. Rick Marshall a ""quantum paleontologist"" who dresses like a park ranger and behaves like a spoiled immature doofus. When Matt Lauer of ""The Today Show"" questions his claim that our energy crisis can be solved with transdimensional portals Rick charges the host windmilling punches. Demoted to teaching kiddie science classes at the La Brea Tar Pits hes a bitter laughingstock until science babe Holly Cantrell (Anna Friel) insists he complete his research. The likeliest gateway to an alternate reality is located in a cheesy roadside amusement park run by Will Stanton (Danny McBride) a macho redneck tour guide. Before you can say ""wormhole"" the trio are running from angry dinosaurs reptilian aliens and giant mosquitoes on a wild wild planet. Its a vast desert littered with Viking longboats midcentury motels pterodactyls Cessnas and the occasional medieval catapult the sort of stuff you might find in the Bermuda Triangles sink drain. Their guide is Chaka (Jorma Taccone) a missing-link teenager who chatters a nonsense language and knows which trees bear the most consciousness-altering fruit. This isnt the ""Land of the Lost"" you remember from childhood but get on its antisocial wavelength and its fitfully laugh-out-loud funny. The film seems to have been written on the fly torn apart and roughly put back together. Director Brad Silberling chooses oddball perspectives on the action shooting the actors as flyspecks on the horizon or running alongside them as they race from danger. The film is so packed with scatological humor you keep looking for the Charmin product placement. Still I give it points for its subversive psychedelic absurdism a choice that will annoy at least as many viewers as it attracts. Its such a skewed quirky misfire that I found its idiocies oddly entertaining. Ferrell and McBride play two flavors of blowhard. Ferrells scientist is an ego wrapped in a lab coat a posturing know-it-all who infuriates a superintelligent T.rex by insisting its brain is ""the size of a walnut. A walnut"" McBride plays his carny character as a cunning lummox woefully lacking in the survivalist skills he claims to have. Friel is a supportive innocent sidekick with a gullible streak as wide as a landing strip. Monkey-boy Chaka nuzzles against Holly affectionately and slyly gropes her whenever he can sneak one in. LAND OF THE LOST  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for crude and sexual content and for language including a drug reference. Mainstream summertime action fantasies are about ordinary people coping with extraordinary events. ""Land of the Lost"" spins the innocent family-oriented concept on its ear with characters who are sketchy untrustworthy or a bit repulsive. If that violates your childhood memories of the TV series get over it. The film pushes against audience expectations with humor that is wrong bad and uncomfortable. But its sort of awe-inspiring to see a velociraptor pack attack an ice cream truck with thrilling kinetic immediacy followed by a shot of one critter running around wearing the drivers red-and-white-striped hat.

Those parents will surely be cringing as  Ferrell reaches into his pants to pleasure himself.  A half-man half-ape repeatedly fondles Anna Friels breasts.  Ferrell under the influence of a hallucinogenic substance strokes the aforementioned creatures hair and contemplates kissing him.  Ferrell out of nowhere blasphemes about Jesus. Nominally based on Sid and Marty Kroffts innocuous 70s TV show ""Land of the Lost"" the film -- which reportedly carries a price tag of more than 100 million -- does not seem aimed at any identifiable demographic except fans of bad movies. PHOTOS Top 10 Funniest Ferrell Characters MOVIE BLOG Reviewing Stand Lotsa Laughs Even hard-core adult fans of Ferrells frat-boy humor may have trouble swallowing the movies big gross-out scene -- wherein he repeatedly douses himself with a jug of dinosaur urine. There are also plentiful poop jokes. Not to mention the torturous sequence in which a scantily clad Ferrell prances through a field of pterodactyl eggs while accompanied by a much-heard number from ""A Chorus Line."" If it sounds like Im describing a bunch of scenes rather than a movie thats exactly what weve got here. Ferrell plays a disgraced scientist who is sucked into a time warp along with a doctoral student (Friel) and a nitwit tour guide (Danny McBride). They all end up in a place where ""past present and future mash up together"" where they run from dinosaurs and actors in rubber alien suits try to stop the conquest of the universe and plot to get back to their own time. Mostly theyre swimming upstream in decades of random cultural references -- everything from the original ""Planet of the Apes"" to the 1956 play ""Tea and Sympathy."" Director Brad Silberling (""Casper"") indulges Ferrell even more than his usual enabler Adam McKay letting scenes play out long long after its clear the joke isnt working. The special effects arent bad but there isnt an instant youre not aware that the action -- and thats a kind term -- is taking place on a Hollywood sound stage. Friel who strips her jeans into cutoffs early on serves mostly as the decorative rebuttal to the plentiful gay-panic jokes. The increasingly desperate comic heavy lifting is left to Ferrell McBride (""Pineapple Express"") and Jorma Taccone of ""Saturday Night Live"" -- who will likely spend decades trying to live down his grotesque role as the half-man half-ape. To report that Matt Lauer in two lengthy scenes as himself gives the funniest performance in ""Land of the Lost"" is to damn it with the faintest praise possible. lou.lumenicknypost.com LAND OF THE LOST Half a star Jurassic snark. Running time 106 minutes. Rated PG-13 (crude humor sexuality drugs profanity). At the Empire the Union Square the Lincoln Square.

Will Ferrell from left Anna Friel and Danny McBride star in Land of the Lost. Photo Universal Pictures Land of the Lost 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Land of the Lostwas a dreadful television show. Those who watched NBC on Saturday mornings may recall with fond nostalgia its rubberized production values and stultifying dialogue but believe me it was even worse than you remember. (Netflix doesnt lie.) Yet dreadfulness lowers the bar for any remake a fact exploited by this new expensive totally trippy Will Ferrellization of the mid-1970s fantasy series. Filmmakers have more license with a bad TV show than a good one even when the new versions producers include the very brothers -- Sid and Marty Krofft -- who created the old. Everyone it seems was determined to make this big-screen parody as retro-trippy as humanly possible utilizing lizard suits woozy Theramin music and scenes that Salvador Dali might have cooked up for a stoner movie. The result is eight times as strange and exponentially more potty-mouthed than the original series. Directed by Brad Silberling (10 Items or Less) from a screenplay by Chris Henchy and Dennis McNicholas Land of the Lost starts with roughly the same premise A yellow raft and three intrepid occupants get flushed down a whirlpool into an alternate reality where they meet thundering dinosaurs nattering ape-men and lizardlike bipeds known as Sleestaks. The castaways are still named Marshall Will and Holly. Theres still a T. rex named Grumpy and an ape boy named Chaka. A reptilian dude named Enik still stands around issuing stentorian directives. Otherwise Holly (Anna Friel) and Will (Danny McBride) are no longer whiny siblings but a plucky British scientist and a horny denim-encased fireworks salesman. Dr. Marshall (Ferrell) isnt their dad but the disgraced physicist behind the ""tachyon amplifier"" a convoluted thingamajig that opens interdimensional portals and as a bonus plays the original cast recording of A Chorus Line. This leads Marshall amp; Co. to the terra incognita of the title where extinct species mingle with time-hopping bric-a-brac -- an ice cream truck a drive-in theater -- in a prehistoric landscape. It also leads to some of the films weirder campier Ferrellian touches such as the bit when Marshall dances past pterodactyl eggs to the tune of I Hope I Get It. This made me laugh; it might make someone else plead for mercy or a refund. Thats how it usually works with Ferrell a practitioner of self-mortifying man-boy absurdism whose exposed hairy belly is as good a metaphor as any for his shtick. If you can stand the midriff you can stand him. The movies wafer-thin plot -- basically theyre all trying to get back home -- is just an excuse for Ferrell McBride and Jorma Taccone (as Chaka) to drag out the boob dino pee and narcotic-fruit-juice jokes against a backdrop of time-warped surrealism. Almost every gag is a notch too spacey and a minute too long. It all amounts to a certain brand of comedy -- something closer to long-form Dada than conventional humor. For that we turn to the films hilarious Matt Lauer bookends in which the normally genial Todayshow host makes his mark with a few pissy close-ups and a fire extinguisher. Marshall may hate his guts (""Matt Lauer can suck it"") but as for me? After this? I love the guy. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Dicks Sporting Goods Clearance Sale Extra 40% off + free...

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post In the snickering comedy redux ""Land of the Lost"" a contrite Dr. Rick Marshall played by Will Ferrell (pretty much as himself) must apologize to his fellow stranded travelers researcher Holly Cantrell and edgy bumpkin Will Stanton. The paleontologists time- travel invention has plunged the trio into a world of ape-like people lizardy beings and hungry dinosaurs. And after a series of near-fatal (and occasionally funny) disasters Marshall goes negative on his co-misadventurers played by an overly game Anna Friel and a barely tamed Danny McBride. Then he wants to make up. As he approaches the campsite he strums a banjo. Ferrells approach is underplayed and outlandish. For too brief a moment it defines the genre that the comic actor is helping create American Absurdism. Then the spell is broken. The good stuff gives way to the obviously silly and the surprisingly crass. Director Brad Silbering and co-writers Chris Henchy amp; Dennis McNicholas swing between the zany and the tiresome ""A Chorus Line"" running riff here a raunchy giggle there and there and there. ""Land of the Lost"" finds lots of opportunities to talk dirty and get a little naughty. Mischievous primate Chaka provides the groping gags. Will talks the dirty talk. Marshall and Cantrell meet Stanton at a rundown roadside attraction that could double as a horror-movie location. McBride became a hit with Ferrell and his comedy compatriots with the mean martial-arts comedy ""The Foot Fist Way."" As Will Stanton his edge is barely dulled. His presence makes this teen not tween fare. The special effects are goofball (though the sight of little feeding frenzied dinos is cool). ""Land of the Lost"" is a ride -- not so much in the popcorn-flick sense as in the Universal Studios vein. Similarly Matt Lauers cameo is oh-so-clever -- for a corporate tie-in. What else could compel a return to brothers Sid and Marty Kroffts woefully dated 70s kids series in which a father and his children disappear into a space-time vortex? Although the original on NBC is rumored to have a cult following the DVD set (available in a groovy lunch pail) suggest that its a cult in which none of the devotees have participated since they were 5.

By Peter Rainer June 5 2009 Save for later Saved Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? It sounded like a funny idea. Will Ferrell in a movie about a nincompoop scientist who ends up in a mishmashed time warp where dinosaurs still rule the earth. (There were times during ""Jurassic Park"" when I would have welcomed some goofball slapstick.) But funny ideas dont automatically make for funny movies. In this regard ""Land of the Lost"" which takes off from the 1970s TV series is Exhibit A.With his belligerent blankness and gawky aplomb Ferrell has made me laugh as much as any comic of his generation but hes not doing anything fresh in ""Land of the Lost."" Maybe if the jokes were any good or the direction (by Brad Silberling) was more than traffic-managing or his talented co-star Anna Friel was given more to do than be vacuously spunky. Its all so resolutely uninspired that even the kids in the audience may want to duck out. Grade D+ (Rated PG-13 for crude and sexual content and for language including a drug reference.)

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 4 2009 742 PM Dumb Summer Guy Movies The Hangover and Land of the Lost attempt to amuse dudes everywhere. By Dana Stevens Listen to Dana Stevenss Spoiler Special about Land of the Lost using the player below Youll find discussions of other recent movies here and you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast in iTunes. Ed Helms in The Hangover If June is the month of weddings its also the month of bachelor parties. The entertainment of choice at such events tends to be something more ... interactive than going to the movies but any grooms out there looking for a cheap bachelor-party package have two dumb summer guy movies to choose from this weekend The Hangover (Warner Bros.) and Land of The Lost (Universal Studios). The DSG genre is not to be scoffed at--its given us such classic comedies as Caddyshack and Animal House and more recently Wedding Crashers and The 40-Year-Old Virgin--and has done much to codify the behavior of drunk heterosexual men everywhere. If it werent for DSG movies what would dudes quote to one another in bars? Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Neither The Hangover nor Land of the Lost provides any jokes quotable enough to survive the summer of 2009 but in their amiable sophomoric how-low-can-you-go way theyre both pretty fun. The Hangover tells the story of a Vegas bachelor party and its aftermath. Four friends including the groom-to-be Doug (Justine Bartha); the brides weirdo brother Alan (Zach Galifianakis); jaded schoolteacher Phil (Bradley Cooper); and uptight dentist Stu (Ed Helms) drive from Los Angeles to Vegas drink some Jagermeister on the casino roof and proceed to enjoy themselves so thoroughly that the next morning they can remember nothing at all. Their hotel suite is trashed with sex dolls bobbing in the hot tub a live tiger in the bathroom and a cooing infant in the closet. The groom as well as Stus upper right incisor has gone inexplicably AWOL. So the remaining members of the party embark on a 24-hour mission to reconstruct what happened return baby and tiger to their rightful homes and locate Doug in time for his wedding the next day. Advertisement The Hangover was directed by Todd Philips who gave the similarly themed Old School  a melancholic sweetness. But this movies cast lacks the comic firepower of Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughan (though Ed Helms a former Daily Show correspondent acquits himself nicely as the henpecked Stu and Galifianakis takes the needy social-skills-deprived Alan to some surprisingly creepy places). The setups are funnier than the follow-through The image of a tiger prowling a hotel bathroom for example promises a level of Surrealist absurdism that the script never manages to sustain. As the boys piece together their night with help from an obliging stripper (Heather Graham) and a gay Asian gangster (Ken Jeong) the movie loses momentum rather than picking it up. This kind of ""one crazy night"" tale relies on drum-tight structure to work. Without it The Hangover sputters to a sentimental halt. Still its worth staying for the closing credits in which an outrageous photo montage finally reveals what transpired during the boys collective blackout. Land of the Lost I have the feeling Im going to be one of the few critics who enjoyed Land of the Lost. Lord knows I occupy the movies demographic sweet spot--I was 8 years old when the deeply strange live-action Saturday-morning series began airing in 1974 and my siblings and I used to watch it Pop-Tarts in hand on a wood-grain Zenith console TV. These details constitute the kind of pop-culture detritus that Brad Silberlings likable lug of a comedy glories in. The ""land of the lost"" is a kind of cosmic depot where random bits of junk--an ice-cream truck a motel pool--fall through a time-space portal to be in essence played with by the movies heroes. And thats what the movie is too a brightly colored proudly pointless toy. If your Will Ferrell laugh threshold is as low as mine--hell I still watch the ""More cowbell"" skit--you could do worse. Ferrell plays Dr. Rick Marshall a ""quantum paleontologist"" obsessed with time travel. Hes an over-the-hill crackpot scoffed at by all except for a wide-eyed British grad student Holly (Anna Friel) who thinks hes a misunderstood genius. Together Rick and Holly go to explore a potential rip in the time-space continuum which just happens to be inside a funhouse ride manned by redneck scam artist Will (Danny McBride keeping up his yearlong streak of scene-stealing sidekick roles). Soon the three of them are tumbling down a waterfall into the aforementioned land where they encounter a horny monkey-man (Jorma Taccone) an enraged T-Rex and tribe of slow-moving lizard people called the Sleestak. (In the low-tech spirit of the original series these menacing reptiles are still played by real nondigitized actors in rubber suits. In a concession to the magic of modern special effects the zippers up the back are no longer visible.) LotL purists will note that a disturbing liberty has been taken with the source material In the old show Will and Holly were the names of Dr. Marshalls children which means that his daughter (the gingham shirt the blond braids) has now been converted into a potential love interest. Its as if in a Brady Bunch remake Mr. Brady were suddenly making out with Marcia. If you can get past the fundamental wrongness of that image Land of the Lost is an enjoyable regression to Saturday mornings gone by as junky and sweet as a strawberry Pop-Tart.

"Land of the Lost Lost cause | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsLand of the Lost Lost causeLand of the Lost comes with its own escape hatch.Will Ferrell left Anna Friel and Danny McBride scramble for survival in Land of the Lost based on the 1970s show created by Sid and Marty Krofft.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. June 5 2009 Land of the Lost (out of 4)Starring Will Ferrell Danny McBride Anna Friel and Jorma Taccone. Directed by Brad Silberling. 102 minutes. At major theatres. PG Land of the Lost comes with its own escape hatch.Directed with fart-gag flair by Brad Silberling (Casper Lemony Snicket) it harmlessly riffs off the celebrated cheesiness of a 1970s childrens TV show about time travel dinosaurs and shuffling lizard men. Taking it seriously would be like criticizing a clown for wearing too much greasepaint.Still is the hatch big enough for Will Ferrell to wiggle through? The big galoot is always game for any indignity to get a laugh including dousing himself with dinosaur urine yet theres a certain numbness to his dumbness this time. Hes not quite phoning it in but hes maybe tweeting it in.Liberties have been taken with the TV scenario created by Sid and Marty Krofft in which the time travellers were family members. The names are the same but the trekkers are all strangers caught in a time vortex caused by ""trans-dimensional energy.""Theyre accidentally proving the theory of Ferrells Dr. Rick Marshall a ""quantum palaeontologist"" who disgraced himself within the scientific community with his wild-eyed notions about alternate worlds. Marshall pushes his crackpot ideas so hard he has to be escorted off the Today show set after assaulting host Matt Lauer (who plays himself).The only person who believes in Marshall is Cambridge doctoral student Holly (Anna Friel of TVs Pushing Daisies). She makes it obvious shed follow Marshall anywhere no matter how dense and stubborn he is. The third member of the group is opportunistic tour guide Will (Danny McBride) who runs a rundown carnival that just happens to be smack-dab in the middle of a time vortex. Marshall activates the vortex with a time-travelling machine cobbled out of spare parts including a boom box that constantly (and unfunnily) plays the soundtrack from the stage musical A Chorus Line.Our hapless trio get zapped to an alternate world that clearly isnt Earth - judging by all those extra moons in the sky - but which looks a lot like the California desert. Its a place where random stuff from various times and places ends up which may explain what happens to all those socks that end up missing in the dryer.The anything-goes conceit allows cavemen and dinosaurs to roam together among such anachronistic junk as 1950s automobiles an old motel (completely with fully functioning swimming pool) and a Bobs Big Boy sign. Slow-moving lizard people called Sleestak show up to add modest drama and an ape-man called Chaka (Jorma Taccone of Saturday Night Live) becomes the travellers prehistoric pal. Good thing Holly knows how to speak caveman.It sounds sketchy - and it is. Screenwriters Chris Henchy and Dennis McNicholas TV veterans both make no attempt to elevate the material beyond the childish impulse to laugh at rude smells and the presumed ability of a Tyrannosaurus rex to poop out someone it has just swallowed whole.They havent given Ferrell a single witty line which may explain why he seems to be so grimly going through the motions. The jokes arent just worn out theyre clubbed to death.The thing thats truly lost about this Land may be the audience. The original TV series revisited in the early 1990s was aimed at young kids and preteens. That audience is now approaching or well into middle age. Will this movie occasion the same nostalgia and ticket-buying fervour as the first Scooby-Doo movie did? It might take a quantum palaeontologist to answer that not-so-urgent question.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

By Joe Morgenstern Updated June 5 2009 1201 a.m. ET General Motors may be in a class by itself when it comes to bankruptcy but so is the aptly named ""Land of the Lost."" This dramatically thematically and artistically bankrupt comic fantasy cost something in the neighborhood of 100 million to make and isnt worth the celluloid its printed on. ENLARGE Will Ferrell as the quantum paleontologist Rick Marshall in ""Land of the Lost."" Universal Pictures The territory of the title was originally explored in a pleasingly unpretentious 1970s childrens TV series produced by Sid and Marty Krofft. The big-screen version borrowed the title and the general premise of three characters trapped in a prehistoric world then got stuck in the swamps of parody. Will Ferrell is Dr. Rick Marshall a quantum paleontologist--the first of many flip unfunny notions--who seems to be a quantum hustler until Anna Friels sexy Cambridge doctoral candidate Holly pops in from England to announce her admiration for his work. And sure enough Ricks tachyon amplifier an invention that looks like a castoff prop from ""Back to the Future"" takes them back to the time of the T-Rexes though not before they are joined by a goofball survivalist named Will; hes played by Danny McBride with a self-delight that oscillates between unseemly and unsavory. (Matt Lauer does a pallid version of himself interviewing Rick on TV.) Its hard to exaggerate the dispiriting vacuousness of the film which was directed by Brad Silberling from a script by Chris Henchy and Dennis McNicholas. Mr. Ferrell deploys the same straight face flattened affect and faux-candor that has served him well in such previous features as ""Blades of Glory"" and ""Talladega Nights The Ballad of Ricky Bobby."" But those comedies added value to the subjects being parodied; they were clever in their own right. ""Land of the Lost"" settles for pitifully little in the way of a plot characterization or coherence and seethes with contempt for its audience. Will the audience return the compliment? That would be fitting though young boys may gladly settle for the movies toilet humor and smarmy sex gags. (A lewd primate played crudely by Jorma Taccone cant keep his paws off Annas breasts.) There isnt much else of interest apart from galumphing dinosaurs and other digital riffraff plus assorted images pilfered from such eclectic sources as ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" ""Indiana Jones"" ""Planet of the Apes"" and ""A Chorus Line."" The prehistoric landscape is dotted with so many time-warpy oddments--a derelict Ferris wheel an Art Moderne motel tailfinned Cadillacs a Kodak kiosk an ice-cream truck--that Rick likens it to a ""cosmic lost and found."" Its more of a filmmakers lost and found with heavy emphasis on the lost. ENLARGE Liping Lu in the Chinese film ""24 City."" The Cinema Guild 24 City Studs Terkel the late chronicler of American workers and their work would have loved ""24 City."" I certainly did and I hadnt expected to be stirred by an account of Chinese workers and their labors over the course of decades in a factory that became their whole world. (The film opens today in New York and will play other cities in the coming weeks.) The director was Jia Zhang Ke whose remarkable 2006 feature ""Still Life"" took place at the feverish moment when cities on the Yangtze Rivers banks were being demolished by the same people whod lived in them so pent-up waters could flow from the Three Gorges Dam. That film used fictional characters to convey the enormity of real events the birth-and-death rhythms of a momentous new age. The new film shot in vivid hi-def video is part documentary and part fiction based on interviews; it uses on-camera interviews with workers some played by themselves and some played by actors to evoke a past of unimaginable toil and suffering in the service of the Communist state. Purists may be put off by this hybrid approach but theres nothing more impure than a documentary that claims to be objective while selling a subtle agenda. ""24 City"" has no agenda despite critics who see it as an apologia for harsh policies of the past or a celebration of Chinas new industrial prowess and unbridled consumerism. Mr. Jia is an artist one of the most interesting filmmakers working anywhere in the world and he made his film to bear witness to a way of life while witnesses could still be found. DVD Focus ENLARGE Jason and the Argonauts (1963) Ray Harryhausen has created so much great stop-motion animation for so many marvelous movies that its impossible to say which is the best or the best-loved. This one ranks right up there though and who cares about workaday dinosaurs when you can have swooping Harpies a seven-headed Hydra and whole armies of menacing skeletons. Don Chaffey directed from a smart distinctive script by Appolonios Rhodios Beverley Cross and Jan Read. The film is mercifully irony-free though thats not to suggest that audiences of the time thought they were watching real monsters. They simply knew they were experiencing real entertainment. ENLARGE Manufactured Landscapes (2006) Ive written about Jennifer Baichwals landmark documentary twice before albeit only briefly each time. Inspired by the work of the Canadian photographer Edward Burtynsky ""Manufactured Landscapes"" starts with an eight-minute tracking shot down one aisle of a Chinese factory the size of a small town. Then it follows Mr. Burtynsky on a tour of industrial Asia in order to show--without polemics--the scale of mans activities including Chinas Three Gorges Dam and the impact theyre having on our planet. I thought I had some sense of that impact until I saw this astonishing film. ENLARGE Modern Times (1936) If youre smitten with films and their rich history you cant think about workers work and the workplace without thinking about Charlie Chaplins sublime silent comedy (graced with music and sounds) in which the Little Tramp gets caught in the gears of industry. Five years before Chaplins film was released factory workers marched to the rhythms of Georges Aurics innovative score in Rene Clairs classic satire of mechanization ""A Nous La Liberte."" One can clearly see the source of Chaplins borrowings in Clairs work yet understand why his star-driven film was bound to be so much more popular. --Joe Morgenstern The stories they tell concern the lives they lived in and around Factory 420 a munitions facility cloaked in secrecy that once produced MiG jet fighters among other instruments of war. ""We had to learn not to be wasteful"" one man says; that meant making his own tools and using them until they were worn away to almost nothing. (He speaks almost reverentially of his master or supervisor--suffering in the present from senile dementia--as a man who appreciated how many hands their tools had passed through.) A woman recalls the agony of leaving her young son behind after losing track of him during a brief stopover on a river journey to the factory; shed been given a job essential to national security at a time when Chiang Kai-shek was supposedly poised to invade China and felt she had no choice but to report for the job as directed. Another woman played by the actress Joan Chen was so beautiful that her co-workers called her Little Flower but her blossoming was incomplete; now shes almost 50 and lives alone in a bleak apartment. ""24 City"" functions on a much smaller scale than ""Still Life"" but it too depicts life-and-death rhythms. While the interviews unfold haunting images document the dismemberment of Factory 420 which was torn down so that a luxury high-rise apartment complex--the city within a city of the title--could be built on the same site. Most of the interview subjects are middle-aged or older but the film ends amid scenes of gleaming cityscapes in the new China with a portrait of a new worker. Her name is Su Na she is played by Tao Zhao the co-star of ""Still Life"" and shes an astonishing piece of work--bright bold chic a young woman who wanted to be a model but didnt grow tall enough. She lives beyond her means having bought a pastel-colored New Beetle to make a good impression wears laser-bright lip gloss and holds down a job as a personal shopper while her mother continues to work in a factory that makes telephone poles. Yet the lessons of the arduous past have not entirely been lost on her. After visiting the telephone pole factory Su Na came away shattered by the sight of her exhausted mother carrying inexhaustible supplies of ingots and throwing them in boxes. Now she wants to buy her parents an apartment and says with quiet pride ""I am the daughter of a worker."" Find television listings at LocateTV.

Fans know to interpret this as a personal artistic statement from the actor. Its a metaphor for most of his movies now and what happens to audiences who go in hoping for another ""Anchorman The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" and come out smelling of ""Step Brothers"" and ""Semi-Pro."" This StoryA Land Where Most Jokes Go to WasteLand of the LostTranscript Talk Land of the Lost With Sid and Marty KrofftFind Land of Lost Showtimes TicketsSummer Movie GuideTalk Can Lost Dinos Beat Hangover Winos at Box Office?View All Items in This StoryView Only Top Items in This Story We dont actually get to see Ferrell emerge from the dinosaur butt because in an almost endearing way this ""Land of the Lost"" is strangely faithful to the low-budget feel of its Saturday-morning ancestor It is cheap-looking if a summertime movie with a budget of around 100 million can still look cheap. The dinosaurs and other beasts here feel like CGI loaners from Spielbergs garage. Ferrell the beasts and their co-stars all seem itchy to get back to their trailers and make phone calls to their agents. (Who should be called.) Then again consider the source material keep your arms and legs inside the ride at all times and try to have a little fun. ""Land of the Lost"" is not completely terrible and it moves briskly and safely even though its more laugh-worthy bits have already been seen in endless commercials for the movie. Ferrell is Dr. Rick Marshall a crackpot scientist in a career slump. His research into ""quantum paleontology"" has brought only scorn from his peers and a humiliating appearance on the ""Today"" show. A comely Cambridge graduate student named Holly (Anna Friel) provides some evidence that his theories are valid and the two set off for a roadside tourist cave purportedly filled with the rare crystals that will power Marshalls homemade time-portal machine which is a suitcase-size contraption that randomly emits the soundtrack to ""A Chorus Line"" -- thus admirably providing the punch line for one of only three count em three gay jokes in the whole movie. Floating on a raft through the cave Dr. Marshall and Holly are transported through time-space along with an unwitting dillweed (Danny McBride as tour guide Will) to a parallel dimension. Behold the Land of the Lost part jungle part desert part Six Flags -- a junkyard strewn with pop-historical detritus such as lost ocean liners old motels wrecked flying saucers and the like. Its inhabited by grouchy dinosaurs a tribe of zombielike lizard people (the Sleestaks) and of course the furry Pakuni known as Chaka (Jorma Taccone) who deservedly gets more laughs than Ferrell. It seems everyone gets more laughs than Ferrell here especially McBride but also a giant mosquito a vibrating obelisk a crab and the furry morning anchor host known as Matt Lauer who makes a delightful -- if unwise -- cameo. Ferrells doing everything hes always done having gracelessly perfected the act of spastic bombasticness playing the oblivious and thoroughly uncool loser who ultimately wins. For all the laughs weve shared together his comedy style is ossifying before our eyes. My mind started to drift during ""Land of the Lost"" when I should have been chuckling at its inanity as Dr. Marshall and Will trip out on Chakas inter-dimensional jungle acid while Holly uncovers a sinister Sleestak plot. I wondered What are we doing here? What year is it again? I have memories of Saturday mornings darkened by hissing Sleestaks but a fast journey there and back with YouTube quickly disabuses me of any lasting kitsch value in ""Land of the Lost"" or the need to make it into a movie even as a naughty stoner comedy. Just because we can remember it doesnt mean we need to cinemafy it but obviously that battle was lost a while back around the time ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" movie came out the same summer Ferrell was in that bummer ""Bewitched."" Still some of us would like to know how many more moldered reruns from the Me Decade are left to pillage? The original ""Land of the Lost"" aired from 1974 to 1976 (and was briefly revived in 1991) so it makes sense that Ferrell who was 7 when it first ran can lay some Gen-X claim to the decision to fall into this one. But isnt it time to plunder someone elses childhood fodder? This is my plea to you good-for-nothin millennials before someone greenlights ""H.R. Pufnstuf"" Get busy unseat Will Ferrell and his ilk and bring us the ""Full House"" movie we so richly deserve Or ""Saved by the Bell""? Carmen Sandiego? Anything but this old poop. Land of the Lost (93 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for crude humor and some cheap gore. >> This StoryRead +|Watch +|Talk +| Comments (c) 2009 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  A Land Where Most Jokes Go to Waste Find Land of Lost Showtimes Tickets Summer Movie Guide Land of the Lost Transcript Talk Land of the Lost With Sid and Marty Krofft Talk Can Lost Dinos Beat Hangover Winos at Box Office?",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/04/AR2009060404372.html,200,landofthelost15,landofthelost,washingtonpost

Liam Lacey From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Thursday Jun. 04 2009 338PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 319PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Land of the Lost Directed by Brad Silberling Written by Chris Henchy and Dennis McNicholas Starring Will Ferrell Danny McBride and Anna Friel Classification PG The only discernible intention in Land of the Lost  the latest comedy starring Will Ferrell acting like Will Ferrell seems to have been to take a slight idea and make the least of it in a very expensive way. The movie is derived from a Saturday-morning live-action series which ran on NBC in the mid-seventies about a scientist and his son and daughter who fall through a time portal during an earthquake and find themselves in a parallel world of dinosaurs near-human primates and lizard men. Those who missed the original Land of the Lost  by birth-date or inclination can extrapolate from any number of similar radio and television series about marooned families. Variations include The Swiss Family Robinson  Lost in Space  Gilligans Island and even Survivor  right up to J.J. Abrams current hit Lost . The old Land of the Lost series known for its amusingly overambitious backdrops and effects has already been parodied efficiently by Mad TV . Essentially this is sketch-comedy material stretched out without much imagination and a high rate of misfires. The only other reason for its further development into a 100-million summer movie would seem to be as a prequel to another Universal Studios theme park attraction. Paradoxically the movies first and best scene already recorded in the preview trailers takes place with two men sitting in chairs Ferrell is introduced as pompous crackpot scientist Rick Marshall trying to push his time-travelling theories on The Today Show while being interviewed by a sneering Matt Lauer. From there things move pretty quickly. Three years later exiled to teaching science to bored elementary-school children Marshall seems like a has-been - until he receives an inspirational visit from a worshipful Cambridge scholar Holly (Anna Friel) who urges him to finish his time machine. The two head out to the desert where along with a redneck amusement park operator Will (Danny McBride) they get sucked into a vortex and into another dimension. After a narrow escape from a Tyrannosaurus rex they find themselves with monkey-man Chaka ( Saturday Night Live writer Jorma Taccone in a furry suit). So far the elements loosely match up with the original series. Most of the updates involve more vulgarity. Cha-Ka is a randy monkey who takes every opportunity to grab Hollys breasts and even Professor Marshalls crotch. Marshall covers himself in dinosaur pee as a camouflage and gets an epic hickey from a football-sized mosquito. Land of the Lost is one of those films so caught up in its concept it has forgotten its audience. The campy parody including a time-travelling gadget that plays snippets of the soundtrack from A Chorus Line  are unlikely to mean anything to the kids and the dinosaur poop jokes are wasted on adults. Director Brad Silberling ( Casper  Lemony Snickets A Series of Unforunate Events ) throws around special effects that do nothing to advance the story - antic scenes of raptors tearing up an ice-cream truck or a clumsy parody of Alfred Hitchcocks The Birds in a pterodactyl nest - and run contrary to Ferrells strengths as an off-the-cuff improviser. Like Steve Carells Evan Almighty  its a bad match of studio bloat and intimate comic lead. At best Land of the Lost leaves space for Ferrell and McBride to riff semi-amusingly as McBride cocks a skeptical eye-brow while Ferrell puffs and pouts displays his hairy belly and offers nonsensical ejaculations (""Captain Kirks nipples""). Give Ferrell credit for a certain kind of comic genius - hes worked in higher-profile pictures with bigger paydays - but theres a worrisome pattern of devolution here. Compared to his two starring films from last year Step Brothers and Semi-Pro  the previous entry Blades of Glory  looks respectable. Before that Talladega Nights The Ballad of Ricky Bobby  was better and going back five years Anchorman The Legend of Ron Burgundy  may be his masterpiece. If it werent for the welcome anomaly of his Stranger than Fiction (2006) you get a depressing suspicion hes modelling his career on Chevy Chase.

Special effects over story. Excess excess excess.But like I said Im not going to let it ruin my day.And going to see Land of the Lost - director Brad Silberlings epically silly homage to Sid and Marty Kroffts much-beloved Saturday morning series - wont necessarily ruin your day either.With Ferrell as Dr. Rick Marshall a ""quantum paleontologist"" with big ideas about time travel and ""transdimensional energy"" Land of the Lost jumps from the Today show set (Matt Lauer ""interviewing"" Marshall) to the La Brea Tar Pits (Marshall talking to kids about dinosaurs) to well the titular land of the lost.Said place is accessed via a portal located at a third-rate California desert tourist trap presided over by the redneck doofus Will Stanton (Danny McBride). The professor and his plucky British research assistant Holly (Anna Friel) go there get in a raft with Will and next thing you know the trio are whirlpooling down a space-time vortex - landing in a place full of caves and rocks jungles and temples dinosaurs and Sleestaks - bipedal reptilians with goggle eyes and rows and rows of pointy teeth.""The past present and future are mashed up together"" Marshall explains looking over dunes where a Viking ship and a Cessna plane lie together and where bits of the Golden Gate Bridge the Great Wall and a Union 76 gas-station orb dot the landscape.This is also where Chaka ( Jorma Taccone) a furry missing-link teenager resides. The primate boy speaks in a strange language of grunts and squawks (a UCLA linguist was hired by the studio to develop a vocabulary) and cant keep his hands off Hollys breasts. She doesnt seem to mind.Ferrells Marshall runs around in his Florsheim zipper boots fleeing a ferocious T. rex and the slow-moving Sleestaks ultimately facing off against Enik the Altrusian - a smarter nastier Sleestak who dwells in a Dali-esque field of light crystals and glassy cones. Enik wears a tunic.""Never trust a dude in a tunic"" warns Will. Other quotable moments from Land of the Lost Marshalls exclamatory ""Captain Kirks nipples"" and a joke based on mishearing the words chorizo tacos.Not exactly a hundred million dollars worth of classic comedy.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Its a cultural boneyard. Not at all coincidentally sos the movie. Genially terrible ""Lost"" is lazy sloppy multiplex filler good for a few solid giggles and not much more.Well its summer and Will Ferrell is once more upon us braying the laugh of the wealthy entertainer who plays idiots for a living. ""Land of the Lost"" is something of an archeological dig itself repurposed as it is from the much-loved mid-70s TV show about a family marooned in an alternate universe of dinosaurs and aliens. The series - you can play catch-up on Hulu.com - was the broadcast equivalent of an orange shag rug. The movie picks that rug to shreds and laughs at the pieces.Were not exactly talking ""The Iliad"" here even if the original shows producers Sid and Marty Krofft did draft well-regarded sci-fi writers to work on the scripts. (Schlocky as it was ""Lost"" was a respectable step up from the Kroffts earlier Saturday morning show ""H.R. Pufnstuf"" whose Barney-on-acid visions still haunt this writers waking nightmares.) So Ferrell and his writers have a free hand to reinvent with affectionate mockery.Fair enough. The star plays Rick Marshall a pudgy blowhard - nothing new there - who has invented a ""tachyon amplifier"" with the power to open a gateway to other dimensions. Humiliated on TV by ""Today"" show host Matt Lauer gamely playing himself Marshall still plows ahead on a ""routine expedition"" to the land of three moons accompanied by a comely British scientist (Anna Friel) and a belly-scratching cave guide - Danny McBride lately an inspired supporting boor of guy-comedies like ""Tropic Thunder"" and ""Pineapple Express.""Once there the threesome encounters revved-up jokey versions of the old shows characters a helpful apeman named Cha-ka (Jorma Taccone) a rampaging T. Rex nicknamed ""Grumpy"" those slow-moving Creature From the Black Lagoon knockoffs known as Sleestaks. Because modern summer blockbusters call for modern measures Cha-ka is now constantly horny the Sleestaks have scary double rows of serrated teeth and the T. Rex is no longer an adorable Claymation beastie but a screeching computer-generated behemoth. (Dont take the little ones by the way unless they can handle sub-""Jurassic Park"" scares and a lot of masturbation gags.)Writers Chris Henchy and Dennis McNicholas have backgrounds in TV sitcoms and sketch comedy and Ferrell has been indulging in online comedy shorts. Accordingly ""Land of the Lost"" has the attention span of a caffeinated squirrel scampering from smutty jokes to ragged action sequences and back again. Visually the films a disgrace with jumpy handheld camerawork that plays as if the producers left the tripod back in the party trailer. Your kids could shoot a better movie. Your kids have shot a better movie.Where ""Land of the Lost"" gets its laughs is from stringing dopey/funny pop-culture references along the most tenuous of plotlines. The joke that the tachyon amplifier is built from a boombox that plays the original cast recording of ""A Chorus Line"" eventually gets old but it leads to the movies most goofily inspired bit with Ferrell pirouetting through a lava field of pterodactyl eggs.""Blades of Glory"" got an entire movie out of that though. ""Lost"" is merely built on riffage a Santana vocorder imitation here a nod to Snoopys doghouse there. You could play at home and save on the popcorn. As a diehard fan of pop-cult arcana I appreciated the shout-outs to the 1979 comedy ""The In-Laws"" (Ferrell running around yelling ""Serpentine"") and 1961 shipwreck fantasy ""Mysterious Island"" (a Ray Harryhausen-inspired giant crab meets an appropriate end). But I would have preferred a movie that took the business of being funny a bit more seriously.Still thats what you get with megastar ""SNL"" comedy grads like Ferrell and Mike Myers and at his weakest Adam Sandler the proudly smug assumption that boner jokes bad 70s songs and computer graphics are all you need to separate summer audiences from their money. That may be true but Sid and Marty Krofft deserve better and so do you.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet While its true that great movies often leave audiences asking questions confusion is hardly a litmus test for greatness. Land Of The Lost features a lot of talk about time travel and secret dimensions but one question trumps the others Who is this movie for? The film is strangely faithful to the Sid amp; Marty Krofft show it adapts a Saturday-morning live-action staple fondly but faintly remembered by viewers planted in front of TVs between 1974 and 1977. But the show hardly demands a Watchmen-like fidelity. The film stars the reliably funny Will Ferrell and Danny McBride but doesnt give them a lot of room in the middle of all the action scenes and Dali-goes-to-the-junkyard sets. What gags they do eke out seem alternately too smutty and too subtle for the kids theoretically showing up for all the rampaging dinosaurs and lurching lizard-men. Its a weird mix but sometimes combining unexpected elements creates a powerful reaction. Not this time. Ferrell gets some laughs early on as an expert in ""quantum paleontology"" who believes time travel can solve the Earths troubles or something. Shamed after a disastrous Matt Lauer interview he drops out to teach high school where an enthusiastic fan (Pushing Daisies winning Anna Friel) finds him and attempts to bring him back into action. With tourist-trap proprietor McBride in tow they enter a mysterious alternate dimension filled with a lot of updated beasties from the Krofft series including an angry T-Rex and the ape-man Cha-Ka (Jorma Taccone of the Lonely Island comedy collective). Its a land of monsters and wonderment and a place where from all appearances no fun can escape. Once it crosses into special-effects hell the film doesnt give up on being funny but doesnt have much luck especially when the focus turns to the mugging grope-happy Cha-Ka a source of annoyance from the moment he enters the picture through the bitter end. It doesnt help that neither Ferrell nor McBride bring their best material with McBride offering yet another variation on an angry redneck and Ferrell falling back on Ron Burgundy-like bluster and nonsense exclamations. Theyre two unpredictable talents at their most predictable and the dull action and half-assed story hardly make up for the deflated comedy. So who is this movie for? Maybe it isnt for anyone.

How can I help you?"" ""Yeah listen this is Norris up in the big mans office. We got a problem."" ""What is it?"" ""We got a big hole in the release calendar for the first week of June 2009. Right now it just says Will Ferrell Comedy Blockbuster. We need a property. Whaddaya got kicking around down there? You know something Will Ferrell-y."" ""Well lets see...weve got a caveman script that got some good coverage. Lots of slapstick farting - its pretty Will Ferrell-y."" ""No good. Sonys already got a caveman thing with Jack Black. But I think youre on the right track. How about something with dinosaurs?"" ""Hmm...no nothing with dinosaurs. Except...nah."" ""What is it? Spit it out man"" ""Well weve got the remake rights to Land of the Lost. You know the Sid and Marty Krofft childrens show from the 70s?"" ""Of course I loved that show Its perfect Now...remind me about the premise?"" ""Its a family thing. Youve got Rick Marshall his son Will and daughter Holly. Theyre white-water rafting when this earthquake hits and sends them through a portal into this strange land. Theres dinosaurs there and these lizard guys called Sleestaks and this cute little monkey-boy named Chaka. Its got that whole trippy 70s Krofft vibe and many of the scripts were written by the top science fiction writers of the day - "" ""Yeah yeah listen. That family stuff might have worked on Saturday morning TV but were gonna go a different direction. We need to sex it up a little. Im thinking that chick from Pushing Daisies Anna Faris as Holly."" ""Uh...you mean Anna Friel? Isnt she a little old to play Ferrells daughter?"" ""Yeah thats why shes not the daughter anymore. We make her the love interest. Strip her down to cutoff shorts and a wife-beater shell look hot. The little monkey-boy Chuckles hell keep grabbing her tits What the hell were going for PG-13 anyway."" ""Huh. But what about - "" ""And Will hes not the son. We make him the sidekick. You seen this new guy Danny McBride? Hes kind of the wisecracking redneck in Tropic Thunder. A thinking mans Larry the Cable Guy. We give him basically the same part in this."" ""Ive got to say this doesnt sound a whole lot like Land of the Lost."" ""Were reimagining pal Listen this is how I see it. Ferrell is Rick Marshall. Hes a brilliant scientist but hes also an emotionally stunted man-child. You know hes..."" ""Will Ferrell-y."" ""Exactly And Friel shes this hot scientist who believes in his theories about the space-time whatsis. They go to this roadside tourist attraction kind of a river ride and their guide is McBride. Theres one of these time portal doohickies that sucks them into the land of the lost. They get chased by this big ol CGI T-Rex just like Jurassic Park. Lots of action and chase scenes but plenty of comedy too. Like how about a scene where Ferrell dumps a big jug of dinosaur piss all over himself? And well do some trippy stuff like you said. Like Ferrell and McBride eat some kinda psychedelic fruit and strip down to their skivvies do some slapstick."" ""Ohhh-kay...is there a story here somewhere?"" ""Well worry about that when we need to worry about that. Right now weve got to get the deals in place and notify the special effects guys to start rendering. Big movie like this takes a lot of rendering."" ""So...basically what weve got here is a lazy creatively bankrupt star vehicle for an actor who ran out of new comedic ideas four movies ago. A soulless special effects flick crossed with a tired gross-out comedy. A movie with no real connection to the beloved TV show that shares its name besides its potential as a merchandising juggernaut. Does that about sum it up?""

Reply 2 Another dissapointed viewer... June 18 2009 at 456 pm You couldnt have summed it up better. Actually I take that back. You forgot to put in the part where the producer goes ""Okay youre right...we need a plot. Mmmm...hold on I cant think of anything let me ask this 16 year old pizza guy and see if he has any ideas..."" ""Um...are you sure?"" Norris askes a bit concerned. ""...Okay I got some a great idea now. Its totally not unoringal overdone boring stupid or corny"" The producer cries.

Joe Neumaier Thursday June 4 2009 117 PM Title Land of the Lost Two scientists and a tour guide fall into a hole in space and time. With Will Ferrell Anna Friel Danny McBride. Director Brad Silberling. (146) PG-13. Comic violence. At area theaters. Hollywood must have been pondering this idea for half a decade How can we put Will Ferrell on top of a T-Rex? They finally found a way but to use a line from a different Ferrell film ""Land of the Lost"" is not a big hairy American winning machine. Its more like a broken toy found half-buried in the sand which to a six-year-olds imagination may be the greatest thing ever. Too bad we arent all six-year-olds. Ferrell certainly acts like one though without a rock-solid conceit to plunk his Dr. Rick Marshall down in (as Ron Burgundy Ricky Bobby or his ""Blades of Glory"" ice dancer Chazz Michael Michaels had) that shtick is irritating. The mega-successful funnymans distracted style requires patience for a payoff which like any good laughs never arrives in ""Land of the Lost."" This lumbering ha-ha-look-what-we-remade action-comedy is a high-concept disaster. As in the original 1970s Saturday-morning kids show Marshall is a scientist who discovers a portal into a time-space netherworld populated by dinosaurs furry primates and weird lizard men called Sleestacks. Supporting characters Holly (Anna Friel) and Will (Danny McBride) have been updated to non-family members the former a fellow scientist/love interest for Marshall the latter a dumb huckster whose fake-funhouse cave is where the trio fall into the void. There they find missing artifacts little jibberish-talking Chaka (Jorma Taccone) and Enik the alien who needs help escaping from his other-dimensional prison. Lines from the TV series theme song - ""routine expedition"" ""the greatest earthquake ever known"" - are uttered like wink-wink talismans as McBride does his mouth-breathing shtick which is getting old and Friel is groped by Chaka - who ought to have been a sort-of breakout role instead of just a sight gag. Yet director Brad Silberling (""City of Angels"" ""Moonlight Mile"") has never been known for comedy and well he still isnt. Which brings us to Ferrell the top dog on todays comedy heap. Confident that his dopey affability will earn him goodwill here - which it does for a very short while - the clown prince of ex-""SNL"" stars then gets lost as with last years ""Step Brothers"" in a premise that would barely sustain a sketch. Its depressing to watch Ferrell chatter away about nothing as he runs from the un-special effects because theres nowhere for him to go. This ""Land"" exists at the bottom of the pop-cultural barrel.

Sadly too many indie filmmakers take the bait with the latest victim being Corked a lightly amusing but entirely too flimsy satire of the Sonoma County wine scene. Written and directed by Ross Clendenen and Paul Hawley Corked doesnt tell a story so much as it strings together a lightly connected series of bits concerning typical mockumentary characters the uptight snob riddled with insecurities (Clendenen); the arrogant and clueless blowhard marketing whizzes (Ben Tolpin and Rob Reinis); and for the Reno 911 crowd a mentally disturbed cop (Martina Finch) drunk on her own power. Due to its episodic nature Corked resembles a lot of comedy albums where part of the fun comes from the anticipation of finding out if the next segment is brilliant or truly dreadful. But with Corked you cant just fast-forward to the next funny sequence and since this movies success rate is only about 30 percent youre left with a lot of stretches that are far from effortless to sit through. (Downtown Independent Theater) (Tim Grierson) A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - THE COUNTRY TEACHER The solemn new addition to the tiny elementary school faculty in a rural Czech outpost gets off to a heavily symbolic start by turning his pupils on to the glorious diversity of nature -- a measure not just of how badly he needs to leap out of the closet but what an open book this movie will be. Given the baby steps currently being taken into gay-themed cinema in Central and Eastern Europe one wants to look kindly on any movie that won Best Queer Film at the Reykjavik Film Festival last year. And theres something undeniably fresh about a coming-out story set among animals a-borning and flowers a-blooming rather than a gay bar with support from wisecracking drag queens. But this sweetly ingenuous film written and directed by Bohdan Slama is a lot less sentimental about cows and flowers than it is about its human protagonists who fall dominolike in love with churls who wont love them back. Zuzana Bydzovska is very good as the mother of a sullenly beautiful boy with whom the teacher falls in love but Pavel Liska plays the hapless pedagogue with a long-faced saintliness that leads us to hope in vain for situation comedy. Instead following one truly risky scene we get more natural rebirth and the damp discovery that romantic love may be for the birds but people will always need people. (Nuart) (Ella Taylor)DOWNLOADING NANCY ""Life is like being trapped in the wrong house looking for a way out"" says Nancy (an excruciatingly believable Maria Bello) in this films first moments. A stranger shes met in an s/m chat room named Louis ""Deep Pain"" Farley (Jason Patric) has promised Nancy the torture-n-sex release she yearns for so off she goes to her fate leaving her clueless husband of 15 years (Rufus Sewell) a note saying that shes staying with friends and abandoning viewers to the brutal agonizing transactions between the films three main characters. Nancys overriding resolve dominates this story Nothing will get in the way of her dream death -- neither the love she and Louis come to share nor his attempts to abandon their arrangement. Downloading Nancy is a triumph for the actors particularly Bello; the harsh lighting handheld camera and schizoid electronic soundtrack sink us further into a sense of vertigo and despair. But the jump cuts and nonlinear narrative are gratuitously stylish and when you peel away this films complex performances at the core of its drawn-out suicide spectacle is pain so extreme so alienating and in the end so pointless. (Sunset 5) (Elena Oumano)LAND OF THE LOST Notwithstanding all the boomer studio executives who grow misty-eyed recollecting nerdy childhoods parked in front of the Krofft brothers television creation its hard to think of a compelling reason to remake the popular 1970s sci-fi adventure show for the big screen. Brad Silberlings amiable big puppy of an update has Will Ferrell running at half-speed as an insecure has-been paleontologist who finds himself lost in time and space with the usual nebbishy Wizard of Oz sidekicks -- charming Anna Friel as his fearless assistant a very funny Danny McBride as a trailer-trash survivalist and Jorma Taccone as an oversexed Neanderthal. All the while weird creatures with manga eyes try to get their scaly claws on a time-traveling gizmo that plays gay show tunes far too often to sustain the joke. Like so many nominally child-oriented movies these days Land of the Lost gets its knickers in such a twist trying to curry favor with several demographics at once -- gross-out gags for the nippers scary dinosaurs for the pimply boys and a modicum of wit to keep parental bums in seats -- that it ends up sagging into a pleasantly undistinguished pudding. The big news is that Matt Lauer playing himself can act. A little. Hardly at all really. But hes a jolly good sport and quite handy with a fire extinguisher.

Sep. 13 600pm MY LIFE IN RUINS Substitute ""career"" for ""life"" in the title of this stillborn travelogue comedy and youll have a succinct verdict on My Big Fat Greek Wedding writer-star Nia Vardalos whose efforts to prove herself more than a one-megahit wonder have been greeted by audiences with an apathy previously reserved for the post-Crocodile Dundee oeuvre of Paul Hogan (see the short-lived 2003 sitcom My Big Fat Greek Life and the even shorter-lived 2004 drag-queen farce Connie and Carla). Here in the opening salvo of her double-barreled 2009 comeback bid -- the Vardalos-scripted and -directed I Hate Valentines Day is set to follow in July -- the Greek-Canadian comedienne once more tries to parlay her Hellenic pride into box-office gold starring as an unemployed history professor reduced to working as an Athenian tour guide. The result written by The Simpsons alum Mike Reiss and directed (in a manner of speaking) by Grumpy Old Mens Donald Petrie is a strangely self-loathing affair that paints Vardalos tour group as a uniformly ill-mannered culturally illiterate bunch while rendering Greece itself as a badly plumbed Third World hellhole run by lazy Zorba-dancing louts. The requisite ugly Americans are here as well as the beer-guzzling Aussies and one wizened Viagra-popping widower (Richard Dreyfuss really slumming it). But then what did you expect from a movie with characters named Poupi and Doudi Kakas? (Citywide) (Scott Foundas)GO  PRESSURE COOKER Wilma Stephenson runs her high school culinary-arts class like a Marine sergeant Shes loud cranky and prone to threatening bodily harm. Stephenson a central figure in co-directors Jennifer Grausman and Mark Beckers likable straightforward Pressure Cooker is a slackers nightmare and a nerds masochistic dream. For her students at a northeastern Philadelphia school she might also be their ticket out of stifling homes and a dead-end neighborhood. Pressure Cooker focuses on three seniors taking Stephensons class to prepare for the Culinary Institute of Americas scholarship competition Fatoumata a recent immigrant from Africa who longs to escape her oppressive father; Tyree a football player hoping to secure a future not only for himself but his single mom; and Erica a young woman who after a lifetime of caring for her blind sister has decided to get hers. The intersection of food and identity is briefly explored and the prep/exam sequences have a tension and charm that keeps the film moving toward its literally rewarding climax. Stephenson looms largest as a reminder of what the right teacher can mean to a kid looking for a way out; it takes a strong woman and a special grace to not only let her proteges go year after year but also to practically shove them out the door. (Sunset 5; Monica 4-Plex; Playhouse 7) (Michelle Orange)SERAPHINE Martin Provosts lyrical but bracing portrait of the early-20th-century French painter Seraphine Louis begins and ends with a quietly ecstatic shot of the artist nestling up to the rustling leaves of a majestic tree. In Provosts vision the dirt-poor country housekeepers elemental flower paintings derided by her bourgeois neighbors are powered by her love of nature the direct line she believes she has to the Virgin Mary and the support of Wilhelm Uhde (Ulrich Tukur) a German collector whose floors Seraphine scrubs with the same fervor she brings to collecting chicken blood to mix her own brand of red paint. If Seraphines untutored primitivism is a romance imposed by the filmmaker -- in real life she sat in on art classes for young ladies in Paris -- its a compelling one that seduced an adoring French public and earned the movie seven Cesars including a well-deserved Best Actress award for Yolande Moreau. The actress brings a potent restraint to this beady-eyed unkempt and all-but-feral outcast who seethes with inner struggle between strength and appalling vulnerability. Seraphines dependence on her patron -- a cultivated but emotionally detached homosexual who knew a fellow outsider when he saw one but came and went in her life without warning -- is almost as unbearably moving as her inevitable unraveling when money and fame cut the artist off from her creative wellsprings and drove her over the edge. (Landmark; Playhouse 7) (Ella Taylor)THROW DOWN YOUR HEART It was The Beverly Hillbillies (or rather bluegrass pioneer Earl Scruggs strumming its theme song) that first drew 11-time Grammy-winning banjo sensation Bela Fleck to his musical weapon of choice -- which contrary to what most believe didnt originate in the pig-squealing backwoods of Appalachia. On a heartfelt personal and cultural mission Fleck financed a five-week trip to Uganda Tanzania the Gambia and Mali to revisit the banjos actual African roots and place those five strings back in a more historically accurate context. Along with his audio engineer Dave Sinko and his half-brother Sascha Paladino -- who directs this concert doc-cum-travelogue -- Fleck meets and collaborates with locals from a Ugandan villages only female thumb-piano player and blind multi-instrumentalist Anania Ngoliga to Malian superstar Oumou Sangare. All the jams are fabulously stirring but not sappy especially when Fleck duels with a Gambian man on a three-string akonting (forefather to the banjo) but theres nothing more to the film as if Paul Simon took us behind the scenes of recording Graceland. Its refreshing to see a doc in Africa thats not about the heartbreak of HIV and genocide but setting the bar low means the film could also have been a whole lot shorter.

"Land of the Lost | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; land-of-the-lost ) Land of the Lost (United States 2009) June 03 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli What were they thinking? Not only does the concept of re-imagining a campy Saturday morning TV show as a Will Ferrell ""family-friendly"" big-budget movie sound bad it is bad. A turd of T-Rex proportions Land of the Lost makes one remember last summers Speed Racer fondly. At least that movie was so over-the-top that it was trippy. This movie is dull unfunny (every remotely amusing bit is in the theatrical trailer) and completely unsuitable for viewing by anyone who isnt a charter member of the Will Farrell fan club. Its as if someone gave Ferrell a rejected script for Jurassic Park IV and he decided to infuse it with ""comedic"" shtick that doesnt work and throw in a few nods to the 70s TV series. The result might be painful if it wasnt so sleep inducing. I have often said that if I ever walk out on a movie it wont be something truly awful but one that stagnates in the belly of mediocrity. I nearly walked out on Land of the Lost. A part of me wishes I had done so. Dr. Rick Marshall (Will Ferrell) is a ""quantum paleontologist"" who despite widespread ridicule from mainstream scientists pursues a machine that will allow him to manipulate tachyons and travel through time and into alternate dimensions. He has however all but given up on the research until the arrival of Holly Cantrell (Anna Friel) a pretty physicist from England spurs him to put the finishing touches on his machine. Then with Holly in tow he heads to a tachyon-rich cave to try out the invention. Accompanying them is tour guide Will Stanton (Danny McBride). The device works better than expected and Rick Holly and Will are transported to the ""Land of the Lost"" where dinosaurs roam a race of lizardmen (the Sleestak) are being shaped into an army bound for multi-versal domination and their lone ally is a half-human/half-primate named Chaka (Jorma Taccone). Admittedly I dont remember much about the TV series Land of the Lost which aired in the mid-70s. It was infamous for terrible special effects (rivaling those of Doctor Who) and screenplays by some fairly well-known science fiction authors (including David Gerrold and Larry Niven). The movie pays homage in numerous ways to its predecessor there are the Sleestaks the theme song is incorporated (at least in part) and the characters of Enik and The Zarn make appearances. Overall however one suspects that die-hard fans of the TV series will be horrified by the pastiche that has made its way to the screen. Its difficult to discern the purpose of the movie. On the one hand it has some of the earmarks of a typical dumb raunchy ""Will Ferrell"" comedy although the opportunities for laughter are surprisingly sparse. On the other hand its crammed with special effects almost as if there was some fear that without these the film wouldnt stand up to a litmus test for summer spectacles. The result is that the CGI overshadows Ferrells comedic aptitude but fails to generate enough in the way of an action/adventure element for there to be an effective payoff. The plot doesnt make a lot of sense but since this is a comedy thats the way things are supposed to be right? Its easy enough to forgive a disjointed story and line after line clogged with technobabble when the reward is consistent laughter. But calling the humor in Land of the Lost ""tepid"" may be overstating its effectiveness. The film reminded me of The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy and Lost in Space - big-budget movies that lost the souls of their inspirations and died ignominious box office deaths. Both of those it should be noted were better than Land of the Lost. This is closer to Will Ferrells other TV-to-motion picture abomination Bewitched in its utter failure to engage the audience. Theres something vaguely creepy about changes made to the characters. In the TV series Holly and Will were Ricks kids. In the movie all three of the principals are adults and none of them are related. This leaves open the possibility of a romance between Rick and Holly. While this wont bother anyone bringing a fresh set of eyes to the movie I can see how the quasi-incestuous aspect of this relationship might disturb those who spent numerous Saturday mornings following the adventures of the Family Marshall. By the way I liked Anna Friel as Holly but wasnt as keen on Danny McBrides white trash interpretation of Will. As for Jorma Taccones Chaka all I have to say is that the producers clearly wanted to challenge Jar Jar Binks as the Most Annoying Sidekick to appear in a science fiction-themed movie. Land of the Lost is a mess and a bore and it offers less in the way of a nostalgic flashback than watching a black-and-white TV with rabbit ears. And while few of the jokes are funny some are unexpectedly racy for what is being sold as a ""family film."" It earns its PG-13 rating. Theres plenty of profanity and more than one instance of sexual innuendo so obvious that even the most naA-ve 8-year-old in the audience will ""get it."" (References include but are not limited to female arousal male masturbation and orgies.) Bad taste humor doesnt normally bother me except in cases like this when its not funny and when the studio ignores its presence in an attempt to seduce as many kids as possible into the theater. Those there to see the T-Rex probably arent expecting to observe Will Ferrell stick his hands down his pants for a little self-gratification. (Although to be fair those who saw Old School are probably expecting just that.) Land of the Lost usurps Angels amp; Demons short-lived position as the worst major motion picture of 2009s summer season. My advice to Will Ferrell avoid further remakes - this kind of retro experience makes me want to do what so many LSD abusers have done and forget the 70s. Land of the Lost is only worth watching if you have a desire to see how badly a cheesy TV show can be mangled.

Hinting at the perils in synergy ""Land of the Lost"" conspicuously feels as though someone at Universal was already planning the theme-park ride spinoff before taking a painfully wrong turn with the movie. Modernizing a 1970s childrens TV show known for its cheap special effects offered certain possibilities but the filmmakers have traded in any kid-friendly elements for bathroom humor of dinosaur-sized proportions. The result is a movie with an exceedingly narrow target aud that should test Will Ferrells appeal among boys maybe ages 12-14 -- about the only demo likely able to endure this laborious mess. Director Brad Silberling previously mixed special effects with comedy in ""Casper"" and ""Lemony Snickets A Series of Unfortunate Events"" but all the technology here seems to exist strictly for its own sake without any thought to servicing an actual story. As for the performers cast adrift amid the mayhem lets put it this way Its never a good sign when ""Today"" host Matt Lauer (more synergy there given the NBC-Universal connection) delivers the least irritating performance in a movie. Despite paying lip service to an affinity for the campy source material writers Chris Henchy and Dennis McNicholas have essentially kept the title of Sid and Marty Kroffts original series -- about a father and his two kids who descend into a primeval world complete with lizard people furry monkey-like creatures and one stiff-looking T-Rex -- and mostly abandoned everything else. In essence only the names remain unchanged with Ferrell as Dr. Rick Marshall a ""quantum paleontologist"" who after a disastrous appearance plugging his book with Lauer winds up teaching science to elementary school kids. All that quickly changes however when attractive Cambridge doctoral student Holly (""Pushing Daisies"" Anna Friel deserving better) walks in prodding Marshall to revisit his research. The two schlep out to the middle of nowhere picking up a goofy tour guide Will (Danny McBride a Ferrell repertory member) before being sucked through a roller-coaster-like vortex into the you-know-what. There they encounter the ape-like Chaka (fellow ""Saturday Night Live"" alum Jorma Taccone) who speaks in guttural grunts and keeps not-so-subtly feeling up Holly and a hostile T-Rex that takes an instant dislike to Rick. From there its a tired steep descent down the cinematic evolutionary ladder. Ferrell and McBride appear to enjoy riffing off each other -- including a sequence in which they get wildly high together -- but with only four characters in much of the movie thats a whole lot of them to take. And while Silberling produces a few big visual gags -- from the dinosaurs which strongly resemble those in ""Jurassic Park"" to a thirsty primitive mosquito -- theres an episodic quality to those scenes that makes the exercise play like a tedious trek to the exit in more ways than one. In the process a lot of expensive effects-work is squandered as well as a few cheap-looking elements (including the character designs) meant to evoke the cheeky charms of the original series. Other wasted contributions amid a soundtrack replete with loud screaming include Michael Giacchinos score. Granted this is hardly the first adaptation of a classic TV show to go awry but its among the most misguided. In hindsight the movie looks like a secondary consideration to the marketing possibilities such as the ""Today"" tie-in and Ferrells appearance on the Discovery Channel adventure program ""Man vs. Wild."" ""Bad things happen in caves folks"" Will warns his companions at one point. ""Watch your movies."" As ""Land of the Lost"" proves they can happen in theaters too.

McBride Anna FrielUniversal Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (Rhythm amp; Hues) C Land of the Lost Genre Sci-fi and Fantasy Action/Adventure; Starring Will Ferrell John Boylan Danny R. McBride Anna Friel; Director Brad Silberling; Author Chris Henchy Dennis McNicholas; Release Date Wide 06/05/2009; Runtime (in minutes) 102; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Universal Posted June 3 2009 -- 1200 AM EDT Maybe its something about the primitive setting (or the even more primitive script) but Will Ferrell lets his bumptiously merrily masochistic id hang out in Land of the Lost. As Dr. Rick Marshall a crackpot scientist who gets pulled into an alternate universe of dinosaurs rubbery goggle-eyed lizard creatures and apes who look like men in matted Isaac Mizrahi sweaters Ferrell shrieks in terror like a teenage girl on a roller-coaster ride and at one point he splatters himself with dino urine. When that stings his eyes he tries to ease the pain by splattering on more. (It doesnt work.) A giant mosquito sucks the blood right out of him and an ongoing battle with a T. rex turns into a kind of 12-step test of our heros self-esteem which is roughly a notch below Stuart Smalleys. You get the feeling that Ferrell is working this hard to beat himself up because Land of the Lost a movie based on one of the cheesiest 70s Saturday-morning kids shows ever devised is anything-goes junk. The films only conviction is its investment in its total lack of conviction. With three sidekicks to play off -- Danny McBride as a good-ol-boy survivalist Anna Friel as an eye-candy science groupie and Jorma Taccone as Chaka the nattering boy-faced ape-man -- Ferrell ricochets from one pouty-angry sissy-man routine to the next. He even drops a bitchy F-bomb which more or less signals the desperation of this grab-bag kiddie fantasy. Land of the Lost has stray amusing ?tidbits but overall it leaves you feeling splattered.

Spotlight Will Ferrell From SNL to the big screen ""Land of the Lost"" for instance is a monumentally stupid movie -- in fact calling it a movie at all is somewhat misleading; its mostly an extended skit that allows Will Ferrell and Danny McBride to bounce comedic riffs off one another using the occasional bit of dinosaur waste product for props. Director Brad Silberling never finds the right tone; many of the bits are far too adult for children yet no adult with a brain bigger than a walnut -- inside joke the filmmakers evidently thought was hilarious -- would find the story the least bit compelling. But theres this Its almost certainly not as awful as youd think. Of course youd think that a movie starring Ferrell based on the Sid and Marty Krofft show about time travel from the 70s would be awful indeed. That there are any laughs at all is something of a victory. Ferrell plays Dr. Rick Marshall a paleontologist who thinks hes discovered time warps that take you to places where ""past present and future merge."" Matt Lauer hosting him on the ""Today"" show isnt so sure. A smack-down follows Marshall is humiliated and the next thing we know hes teaching uninspired kids science. (Sample question If you sent a big bag of dope to the sun would it catch on fire and get everyone high?) Suddenly a fan shows up in the form of Holly (Anna Friel) who thinks his theories are anything but crackpot and wants to help him prove their veracity. Yes Holly was Marshalls daughter in the TV series but if youre looking for continuity here youre looking in the wrong place. For instance on the show Will was Marshalls son. Here hes a redneck huckster played by McBride with whom Marshall and Holly travel to an alternate world courtesy of the contraption Marshalls invented. There they encounter dinosaurs including a particularly nasty Tyrannosaurus rex named Grumpy a primate named Chaka (Jorma Taccone) and of course the Sleestaks. The story such as it is involves Enik (John Boylan) a Sleestak scientist convincing the trio they need to find Marshalls machine which was lost to save the universe. Thus they embark with Chaka on a journey to find it. This leads to a sort of desert dumping ground for missing planes ships and other vessels. It also affords Ferrell and McBride plenty of opportunity to hurl digs at one another. Ferrells performance is uneven though thats partly because playing Marshall as an egotistical boob limits him. Friel doesnt have a lot to do other than gamely allow Chaka to grab her chest repeatedly. Its McBride whos the most consistently funny. Whether its here ""Pineapple Express"" ""The Foot Fist Way"" or his HBO series ""Eastbound amp; Down"" McBride plays essentially the same character a foul-mouthed cretin with the possibility of a good heart (here more than ever). Its not lowbrow. Its no-brow. And its really funny. Good thing because without McBride ""Land of the Lost"" would be truly lost indeed.

"Movie Review Land of the Lost -- 2 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie Review Land of the Lost -- 2 out of 5 stars Danny McBride Will Ferrell and Anna Friel Universal Related ""Land of the Lost"" review ""Land of the Lost"" times and tickets ""Land of the Lost"" trailer Related ""Land of the Lost"" review ""Land of the Lost"" times and tickets ""Land of the Lost"" trailer (Universal) Roger MooreSentinel Staff Writer Stupid on an epic scale or epic on a stupid one Land of the Lost is as close as Will Ferrell comes these days to a ""kid friendly"" movie.A mildly ribald farce built around the 1970s childrens TV show about humans stuck in a parallel universe and the weird critters they find there Land of the Lost has been re-engineered for the Ron Burgundy Fan Club. And from the looks of things no expense was spared in hurling the worlds most infamous (and infamously lumpy) underwear model into a Journey to the Center of the Earth comic adventure. Ferrell plays Dr. Rick Marshall a crackpot scientist exiled to a minor museum after a meltdown during a Today Show interview with Matt Lauer.But shapely Brit grad student Holly (Anna Friel) hunts him down and convinces him that hes not mad that there are parallel universes and she has the fossilized cigarette lighter to prove it. Holly and the junk food addict Rick take his ""tachyon amplifier"" to a cheesy cave tourist attraction run by Will (Danny McBride) where an ordinary raft ride turns into a trip to ""a cosmic lost and found"" where pterodactyls fly past Fotomats Cessnas lie entangled with Viking longships and primitive ape-like creatures whose language Holly speaks dodge dinosaurs and get buzzed on fruit juice. Ricks theory -- that you can ""travel sideways in time"" to a ""Land of the Lost"" where ""past present and future meet"" --- is proven true. If only the daft scientist can find a way to get back to our time back on the Today Show. That Matt Lauer is in for it.As with most of Ferrells movies the wackiness spins out of riffs where the players (McBride is good at this) try to top each other with outrageous comments or exclamations.""Captain Kirks nipples"" ""Sweet Gregor Mendel""A friendly apeman (Jorma Taccone) cops a feel. Rick shoves his hand down his shorts and Rick and Will react to a vibrating portal to other dimensions by using it to duet on Chers synthesized hit ""Do You Believe in Life After Love?"" Director Brad Silberlings best picture was Lemony Snicket but hes content to keep the effects convincing and make sure Ferrells reactions to a ""grumpy"" T-rex are in sync with them. Other than that just let the stars do their faintly off-color romping and riffing through a chunk of the desert Southwest where they dont mind if you stick a movie set there and have to listen to a lot of Will Ferrell screaming.Parents who fondly recall the 70s TV show may be a bit surprised at the tenor of this sometimes hilarious but stupid and slapdash star vehicle. But thats what the kids are laughing at these days -- ""Thats gay"" jokes masturbation gags pot references and dino doo-doo.But even if nobody sells a dino-poo gag like Ferrell thats nothing to take to the bank or the Today Show is it?
