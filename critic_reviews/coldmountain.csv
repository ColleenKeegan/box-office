More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

(AP Photo/ MIRAMAX FILMS / Phil Bray) War is hell in the grueling thrilling Cold Mountain and only his fierce longing for the woman he loves keeps Jude Law as a Confederate deserter alive and on the run. 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Cold Mountain Drama. Starring Nicole Kidman Jude Law and Rene Renee Zellweger. Directed by Anthony Minghella. (R. 154 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The South lost the Civil War but theyve won the literature ever since. They even won Ken Burns ""Civil War"" documentary -- what Northern historian could compete with the melodic baritone and sage stage presence of Shelby Foote? The lost cause of the South has become enshrined as noble a last gasp of romance and gentility soon to be swept under by an ungainly tide of urbanization industrialization and immigration. This is what makes the distinctly unromantic ""Cold Mountain"" such a breath of fresh air. Its battles are hideous bloodbaths. The wounds take months to heal. The Southern home front doesnt find patriots banding together in common cause but individuals falling victim to marauding ""home raiders"" -- Southern thugs who steal property and murder deserting soldiers. And the Northern soldiers dont get a pass either. Theyre thieves and rapists. As depicted in ""Cold Mountain"" director Anthony Minghellas rendering of the Charles Frazier novel the South before the collapse of the Confederacy is a world upended where life is cheap and miserable and where a Southern belle doesnt worry about making ball gowns out of curtains but about surviving the winter. If shes in love like Ada -- played by Nicole Kidman -- she also worries about whether shell ever see her sweetheart again. In Adas case she worries for years without any word from the front lines. ""Cold Mountain"" begins with a battle scene so masterfully conceived and shot that somewhere in the ether D.W. Griffith may be taking off his hat. The scene is a succession of brutalities In 1864 at Petersburg Va. the Union troops tunnel under enemy lines and dynamite the Confederates in their trenches. This is followed by a Union charge which turns into a disaster. The charging troops find themselves in a massive ditch exposed to Confederate fire. In the melee Inman (Jude Law) is wounded and hes subsequently sent to a makeshift army hospital. This gives the art director and set decorator a chance to show that theyve faithfully studied Civil War field-hospital daguerreotypes. Knowing that the Southern cause is lost Inman decides to desert before hes quite recovered. The rest of the film alternates between showing Adas struggles at home and Inmans odyssey mainly on foot back to Ada and Cold Mountain N.C. Kidman grows into the role. In the flashback scenes to Ada and Inmans very brief courtship she seems too mature if not in appearance certainly in essence. But as adversity forces Ada to come into her strength and womanliness Kidman gets a handle on Ada and blossoms along with her. The roles defining note is longing -- for peace for a better life but specifically for Inman and everything that reunion might imply -- and that makes it ideal for Kidman who despite her ethereal looks is an especially earthy actress. Her longing his longing. The movie never relinquishes that thread because it guides the action and offers the only promise of a future. The sex drive is the life force the one block on the impulse toward destruction. Theres a moving episode in which Inman is helped by a young widow (a grown-up Natalie Portman) whos nursing a sick infant. She puts him up for the night and ultimately asks him to sleep in her bed just to be able to touch someone again. Grief and sadness are released just by touching hands. That moment has more impact than the sex scenes of 20 other movies. Not all the stations in Inmans episodic journey land with nearly such force though Law remains every inch the collective dream of a Confederate soldier young stoic and feline with something dark and awful behind the eyes. Back on Cold Mountain meanwhile the home front is enlivened by the arrival of Renee Zellweger as Ruby a rough tomboy who can do any kind of farm work. Zellwegers performance is broad and fun and daringly idiosyncratic but never untrue or out of control. We experience Ruby the way we might in real life experience someone like Ruby. First as a character then as a person. At 154 minutes ""Cold Mountain"" is long and seems long at times inspired at times merely dutiful. But in most of the important ways it succeeds. Its impossible to watch the film without hating the home raiders for example or caring whether Inman makes it home. More enduringly ""Cold Mountain"" changes our image of the collapsing Confederacy in the same way that ""Saving Private Ryan"" changed our collective notion of D-Day. You just know it had to be this bad and that if anything it was worse. -- Advisory This film contains strong battle violence murders and sexual situations.

"Cold Mountain Lacks Sizzle washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids Cold Mountain Lacks Sizzle Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 26 2003 NICOLE KIDMAN and Jude Law are walking talking cadavers in love in ""Cold Mountain."" They shuffle through this handsome adaptation of Charles Fraziers celebrated novel like romantic living dead in period costume. You wonder if this is an epic romance or a ghost story. Its unfortunate because just about everything else about ""Cold Mountain"" is involving enough. Writer-director Anthony Minghella has assembled a visually impressive production that gives us a sense of the Civil War that took so many lives and left a whole culture devastated. And almost everyone else in the cast but the leads is terrific particularly Renee Zellweger as a hardscrabble drifter who takes immediate command of the movie. In a North Carolina mountain community in the 1860s Ada Monroe (Kidman) falls in love with Inman (Law) an impossibly angelic laconic man. But as soon as their mutual attraction becomes obvious the Civil War intervenes. Naturally Inman goes to fight but hes injured in battle. Refusing to linger in his hospital bed he undertakes a dangerous journey home intending to reunite with Ada. But the way home is fraught with danger for deserters such as Inman. While Inman is taken up with his ordeals the city-bred Ada -- forced to take over the farm of her deceased father (Donald Sutherland) -- does her best to survive with no experience and no strong hands to help her. Things change when Ruby (Zellweger) a penniless but forceful stranger passes through. She knows a thing or two about managing a farm. In no time she takes over. I mean that in more ways than one. Zellweger chews up the scenery around Kidman. She lays waste to all surrounding structures and vegetation. You almost expect Kidman to slap her for sheer effrontery. This is good and not so good. Zellwegers performance only serves to point out the charisma missing in the two stars. Neither Kidman nor Law has registered much of a body temperature at the best of times. Even Kidmans finest performances seem to have a frosty tinge about them. Here things are no different. As Ada shes picturesque in her elegant Ill-always-have-Tara suffering. But dramatically shes morgue-slab blue. Shes meant to be a Dixie spin on Penelope the wife of the mythic Greek hero Odysseus who maintains a home and wards off a host of ardent suitors for 10 years until her husbands return. But in the end Kidman merely made me think of Lady Penelope a classy character in a 1960s British television series called ""Thunderbirds."" Incidentally the characters in that show were all marionettes. As for Law his stunning good looks and almost catatonic demeanor suggest a master-race automaton. Hes mighty purty as he fights his way back to his darling but theres nothing about him to warm to and therefore little to move you. Hes poster art. In a movie where passionate love is supposed to connect two souls through a war of blood guts and tragedy this marquee chilliness presents a problem. It makes it hard to lose yourself in the movie. But hey its about making 40 million-plus on the first weekend right? Honorable mentions should go to Ray Winstone as the scheming Teague who has his eye on the single Miss Monroe; the wonderfully entertaining Philip Seymour Hoffman as a fallen preacher who makes personal survival his new religion; and Brendan Gleeson one of the worlds best male actors on the strength of the 1998 ""The General"" alone who must content himself here with a relatively minor role as Rubys cheery fiddler of a father. Thanks to Zellweger the supporting actors and Minghellas direction ""Cold Mountain"" manages to stay watchable. Its enough of a spectacle to enjoy. Its too bad the stars are little more than serviceable and give the movie title an irony it could certainly do without. COLD MOUNTAIN (R 154 minutes) -- Contains sex scenes violence and scenes of emotional intensity. Area theaters.

"Southern Odyssey washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living >> Follow Style On Southern Odyssey Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday December 25 2003 Has any man in history had a Christmas morning like the one the novelist Charles Frazier is having this very second? He opens up the big present under his tree and finds a first-class literate moving and sure-to-be-mega-successful movie adaptation of his bestseller ""Cold Mountain."" Oh thats right Hes a writer. Probably found something to grouse about already But heres the best part Its a present for the rest of us as well. ""Cold Mountain"" directed by the subtly spectacular craftsman Anthony Minghella is one of those films that might be called ""complete."" It has everything in the best possible way but most importantly it has a coherent if tragic view of life and society. It builds a world takes you into it makes you feel it; it tells a story makes you love the characters and pulls you through life love and death. Its funny its heartbreaking its scary its exhilarating. Its got love stuff and lots of laughs and cool gunfights. Its really long and it feels like its over in 15 minutes. It does something so few movies do these days It satisfies. Fraziers story famously was a fusion of classical sources -- ""The Odyssey"" in particular -- and family history. Where one stopped and the other started remains open to doubt and Frazier isnt talking. But from Homer comes the prime image a warrior-king in love whos been at war too long who is sick of slaughter who yearns to return to an Ithaca. And in Ithaca there waits patient and loyal but beleaguered the noble Penelope. She is beset by problems and suitors her only armor against an increasingly chaotic world her love of the man. The trip here of course isnt from Troy to Ithaca but from Petersburg Va. to Cold Mountain N.C. in the cold winter of 1864. Our Odysseus is one of those naturally noble southern yeomen who charged at Gettysburg and held firm at the Marne and the Bulge and Pork Chop and Dak To and Tikrit. Inman (Jude Law) is scrawny and tough good in a fight good with guns all in all a most capable man. But hes touched with a kind of special grace and kindness. Hes something of a mystery to his buddies except the one thing they know about him is that hell be there when they need him and he is until they all are dead. As the movie opens he is at the terrible crater in Petersburg that awesome Union snafu where a bold tactical stroke -- a potentially siege-busting mine shaft filled with explosives under the Confederate lines -- resulted in tragedy when the assaulting troops became trapped in their own crater and were slaughtered like cattle. This wasnt much fun for them but it wasnt for their killers either. Wounded the war lost Inman lies abed with the flies gathering at his blown-open neck. All his friends are dead. There arrives a letter from Ada Monroe (luminous Nicole Kidman) declaring her distress wishing him home confessing her adoration. Heres the delirious stroke of genius from Frazier left pristine by Minghella. Ada and Inman Inman and Ada Theyre in love to the level of souls but it is after all the century before the century before this one and things were different then. Love is ethereal and passionate and possibly more forceful because it doesnt involve sex until the words ""I do"" are spoken before the parson. In fact the two have looked longingly at each other at Sunday meeting have shared a few mumbled words (hes not exactly glib by nature) and exactly one kiss when Johnny went marching off to war hurrah hurrah. This love is all the more powerful for remaining unconsummated uncontaminated by lust an expression of feeling not a jingle in the glands. The movie thus follows and cuts vividly (as did Homer first master of the contrapuntal narrative) between the two stories Inman gives himself an honorable discharge and hits the road roaming across the dangerous world of a war where he will be hunted not only by Yankees but also by homegrown ""Home Guard"" men who did not fight but have filled the power vacuum by decreeing themselves a militia with discretionary powers of search seizure and execution. The other story is Adas. Shes utterly of the century that spawned her a delicate flower who can play frilly etudes on the piano and discuss Mr. Thoreaus disagreements with Mr. Emerson but cant plant a bean to save her life. She was brought to Cold Mountain -- a kind of piney sanctuary high in the Blue Ridge -- from the more hospitable climes of Charleston by her pappy (Donald Sutherland) the reverend who then up and died. So shes alone and languishing pitifully until the arrival of Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger). Theres no Ruby in ""The Odyssey"" but there sure is in feminist mythology and there sure is in ""Cold Mountain."" Shes all grit and practicality and stubborn savvy who dont take no sass from no man nor woman nor child. Ruby is the spirit of reality of what must be done to get through the night and Zellweger all but steals the movie as this bundle of furious energy and concentration. Shes not just admirable in her determination but funny in it as well. In fact Minghella has gotten a sublime trio of performances from his stars including his beautiful ones. People this gifted by their genetic mandates frequently just pose their way through life but both Law and Kidman think hard about character and are willing to give up on being beautiful to be real. And of course thats the magic of movies The more real they are the more beautiful they seem. I had trouble with the book because so many of Inmans adventures led nowhere and just ate up pages until he got home. I know a minority view. Still that problem seems muted in the more immediate experience of film production and such interludes as the one with the promiscuous minister Veasey (Philip Seymour Hoffman) the goat lady (Eileen Atkins) and the lonely widow woman (Natalie Portman) feel of a piece with the picaresque not arbitrary at all. And the general view of the ruined South as a ruined paradise still rich in beauty (Romania stands in for a North Carolina now too rich in Mickey Dees to do a filmmaker any good) but blighted by hate and violence that stand against the love and nobility that was there already is utterly convincing. All in all ""Cold Mountain"" is everything you could ask for. Its a great old-fashioned wallow of a time at the movies. Cold Mountain (155 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for violence.

Renee Zellwegers handywoman and Nicole Kidmans belle forge an unlikely friendship in Cold Mountain. Miramax Some thematic predecessors (surprisingly few in number) have portrayed the home front; others the soldiers plight. This one offers both plus characters to remember. Remarkably apolitical given the social forces that launched the conflict the movie focuses on a romance that has no time to combust a pragmatic friendship that blossoms and a Reb deserters squalid odyssey to return home as his unprepared belle Ada (Nicole Kidman) adapts to the inverted world facing her. Like Vivien Leigh in Gone With the Wind Kidman proves there are some women you just cant grind down. She remains beautiful despite suffering credibly through escalating hardships. As Inman a bearded and somewhat slimmer Jude Law is a striking replica of primitive photos weve all seen of Civil War soldiers. Wounded and battle-weary he sneaks out of a hospital for an arduous trek back to North Carolina -- where in flashback we see how he has met and not quite courted the new preachers refined daughter just before war breaks out. After her father dies local casualties mount and a self-proclaimed local enforcer (Ray Winstone) begins shooting deserters Kidman finds a new friend in Renee Zellweger. In a story that can use some levity Zellweger comes through with a broad comic performance as the unpolished all-purpose handywoman in an unlikely living arrangement and alliance with Kidman. Zellwegers performance wouldnt be miscast for The Beverly Hillbillies yet some may find her a believable younger version of the slightly batty 19th-century great-aunts kept alive in family histories. The actors deliver all around Brendan Gleeson as Zellwegers musician dad; Philip Seymour Hoffman as a friendly wastrel; Natalie Portman in her first capable adult performance (nice to see this) as a woman left alone with a sick newborn. Minghella again works with the best crew that money can buy including past associates from The English Patient and The Talented Mr. Ripley. No Oscar voter will want to choose between Dante Ferrettis production design here and Dennis Gassners for Big Fish. Watching this movie it seems to be the next level down from great -- maybe too episodic. But it burns in the memory weeks after you see it. Unmindful of its racism President Woodrow Wilson had the keen cinematic instincts to call The Birth of a Nation ""like history written with lightning."" Theres electricity here too.

Though hes handsome enough to inspire swoons in the aisles (those susceptible to his charms should perhaps arrange for a designated driver after viewing this film) Law has long shunned leading-man roles in favor of vivid character turns. Here though hes at the center of the picture as Confederate soldier Inman a man of few words who nonetheless falls deeply in love with the ministers beautiful daughter Ada (Nicole Kidman). And in that key early scene he lingers outside Adas home on a twilit evening turning to look at her as they chat on the porch. Thats all he does -- a turn of the head a quick shift of the eyes -- but its electric as if he were shot through by lightning as if suddenly no other person existed on Earth but her. Movie review Showtimes and trailer 1/2 ""Cold Mountain"" with Jude Law Nicole Kidman Renee Zellweger Donald Sutherland Ray Winstone Brendan Gleeson Philip Seymour Hoffman Natalie Portman Eileen Atkins. Written and directed by Anthony Minghella based on the novel by Charles Frazier. 154 minutes. Rated R for violence and sexuality. Several theaters. ""Cold Mountain"" opening today rises or falls on whether we believe Inmans love for Ada and in that moment its unmistakable. Falling in love is a common occurrence on screen but rarely is it so palpable so razor-sharp. Laws performance embodied in that moment sustains us throughout the movie just as love sustains Inman during his long separation from Ada. Ill wait for you she says and he finds his hope in those words. Charles Fraziers best-selling novel takes Homers ""Odyssey"" and transports it to the Civil War South An injured warrior makes a long and perilous journey home to the arms of the woman he hopes is waiting for him. And in the hands of Minghella who with ""The English Patient"" proved himself master of the sweeping romantic epic it becomes a study in yearning of two isolated people dreaming of a future they each glimpsed in the others eyes. Kidman whose porcelain skin and delicate features perfectly suit a Southern belle gives a performance less vivid than Laws particularly in the first half of the film. Her Ada is almost too restrained too ladylike; we dont quite see the depths of passion she must feel. (Is this talented actress who gave the performance of her life in near-unrecognizable disguise in ""The Hours"" at her best when we -- and her directors -- are not distracted by her uncanny beauty?) No matter; Law smolders enough for both of them and Minghella has surrounded them with a brilliant supporting cast each of whom gets a moment to shine Donald Sutherland as the mellow-toned minister; Philip Seymour Hoffman as a dissolute preacher (""The Good Lord"" he says with a rakish drawl ""can be very flexible""); Natalie Portman as a grieving young widow; Ray Winstone as Teague the corrupt head of the Home Guard; Eileen Atkins as a backwoods furrier who can ""pretty much survive off a goat."" Best of all is Renee Zellweger as the drifter Ruby who moves into Adas home and helps her run the farm despite the poverty of wartime. Zellweger who inevitably manages to find something fresh in every new role bursts into the film like a sudden storm yelping her lines with a raspy sparkle. When delicate Ada cowers at the sight of an aggressive rooster Ruby nonchalantly grabs the offender and snaps its neck as if breaking a twig. ""Lets put him in a pot"" she says with gusto. Like ""The English Patient"" ""Cold Mountain"" is romance steeped in sadness; all the beautiful landscapes that Minghella and director of photography John Seale show us cant hide the tragedy of war and how it transforms these characters. Adas quiet words late in the film sum up the mood of this haunting film ""What we have lost can never be returned to us.""

Story Tools YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Renee Zellweger Nicole Kidman Jude Law Review or Create your own Manage alerts | What is this? (CNN) -- The film adaptation of ""Cold Mountain"" is an epic love story that conveys the horrors of war in an up-close and personal way often attempted in movies but rarely achieved. Based on Charles Fraziers 1997 novel this highly sentimental tale set during the American Civil War is also achingly romantic and has Oscar written all over it. With Nicole Kidman Renee Zellweger and Jude Law the movie contains some of the best acting of the year and is beautifully mounted by Academy Award-winning director Anthony Minghella (""The English Patient""). ""Cold Mountain"" blatantly tugs at your heartstrings while exploring the heartlessness of war. At times the story verges on sliding into a vapid emotional soup but Minghella (who also adapted the script from the original book) and his superb cast never quite let that happen. Kidman stars as Ada a well-bred preachers daughter who falls in love with a simple working man from Cold Mountain North Carolina named Inman -- played with great skill by Law. When the Civil War breaks out Inman and every other able-bodied man in the area join the Confederate army. Zellweger plays the feisty Ruby a no-nonsense earthy country woman who helps the sheltered Ada during the darkest days of the war when she almost gives up hope of seeing Inman again. The scene when Ruby first meets Ada is wonderful and establishes their relationship instantly. In the waning days of the savage conflict Inman escapes from a hospital and begins to walk hundreds of miles back home to Cold Mountain. There Ada and Ruby are faced with a group of lawless thugs called the Home Guard who have taken it upon themselves to terrorize civilians in the name of the Confederacy. Ultimately the film is a tale of the journeys of the three main characters Inmans physical trek as he tries to return home against all odds and Adas and Rubys struggles of the heart and soul as they fight to survive the bitter hardships in a ravaged land. Minghellas mesmerizing adaptation Adapting a well-loved novel to the big screen is Minghellas specialty The director did it with ""The English Patient"" in 1996 and ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" in 1999. He once again has achieved the miracle of transforming a difficult book with an inner narrative into a deeply satisfying film. Jude Law plays a Confederate soldier in ""Cold Mountain."" There are also three small performances of great note Philip Seymour Hoffman as a disgraced minister Natalie Portman as a helpless farmers wife rescued by Inman and Giovanni Ribisi as a despicable backwoodsman who betrays Inman. Also look for the character of Georgia played by Jack White of the White Stripes His originally was a singing role but the rocker ended up with a few lines in the finished film. Hes also romantically linked with Zellweger. Superlatives extend beyond cast Shot mostly on location in Romania ""Cold Mountain"" reeks of authenticity. Moviegoers will feel swept back into the 1860s. Cinematographer John Seale who also worked on ""Ripley"" and won an Academy Award with Minghella for ""The English Patient"" is a master at framing shots while intermixing intimate images with grand visual sequences. Composer Gabriel Yared who also received an Oscar for ""The English Patient"" provides a sweeping score that underlines the deep emotions and grand themes in this marvelous movie. But its the authentic folk and bluegrass music produced by T-Bone Burnett (""O Brother Where Art Thou?"") that captures the mood and essence of the times. In the few remaining days of Academy Award consideration ""Cold Mountain"" emerges as a main contender with ""The Lord of the Rings The Return of the King"" as a front-runner for the years best picture. ""Cold Mountain"" opens nationwide Thursday. It is rated R with a running time of 155 minutes.

"Cold Mountain | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; cold-mountain ) Cold Mountain (United States 2003) A movie review by James Berardinelli Its not often that when the primary thread of a movie fails the secondary storylines are compelling enough to make the overall experience a positive one. However that occurs with Cold Mountain a Civil War era romance where the love affair fizzles but the episodic approach allows the narrative to breathe. The end result is that the film has more to offer than the tepid Nicole Kidman/Jude Law pairing. There are a lot of things to like about Cold Mountain but those expecting director Anthony Minghella to recapture the tragic romantic enchantment of The English Patient will be disappointed. The second half of Cold Mountain is significantly better than the first. Writer/director Minghella has the unenviable task of cramming a lot of background information (done via flashbacks) into the first 60 minutes as well as getting things off to an explosive start. While we are provided with all the necessary information the underlying feelings are regrettably absent. The central motivating force for the main characters - an unquenchable love - comes across more like a writers conceit than something elemental that exists between these two. We know that Inman (Law) and Ada (Kidman) are in love because the movie tells us so not because we are given a compelling reason to believe it. Consequently although we end up caring about the characters on an individual basis the question of whether they are given a chance to re-connect is of secondary importance. The movie opens in 1864 with the South well on its way to losing the Civil War. After recovering from a devastating injury infantryman Inman decides to desert and make his way back to his home town of Cold Mountain North Carolina where he hopes to have a life with Ada the preachers daughter. It has been three years since they last saw each other and he doesnt know for sure whether she is waiting for him. They hardly know each other - their interaction was brief but left a lasting impression. However the trek back to Cold Mountain proves to be an arduous one. Along the way Inman meets a number of odd people some of whom are interested in helping and others who see him only as a way to make a profit. Meanwhile Ada has been waiting. Following the death of her father (Donald Sutherland) she has let the farm lapse into disarray. Enter Ruby Thewes (RenA(c)e Zellweger) a plain-speaking freespirit who offers to help Ada rebuild the farm in exchange for meals and lodging. A bargain is struck and the two begin a mutually beneficial partnership that develops into a friendship. But troubles lurk. The head of the local ""home guards"" (Ray Winstone who does evil as well as anyone) a group empowered to kill deserters wants Ada and her land and Rubys father (Brendan Gleeson) pays his daughter an unexpected visit. Cold Mountain receives a much needed boost of energy with the introduction of Zellwegers Ruby an event which occurs just before the end of the first hour. She is flamboyant and energetic - two characteristics that do not apply to either Kidman or Law. While its unfair to impugn the two leads since both do adequate jobs Zellweger constantly forces Kidman into the background by the forcefulness of her performance. Law suffers the same fate at the hand of numerous supporting players including Philip Seymour Hoffman (as a philandering minister) Natalie Portman (as a young mother who is victimized by Union soldiers) and Aileen Atkins (as a loner in the woods who helps Inman). Cold Mountains strengths lie in its vignettes. Inman and Adas paths to their reunion are broken into various episodes. Some of these are quite good and even the least impressive retains some degree of interest. Its fair to say in Cold Mountains case that the journey counts more than what happens once the destination is reached. In fact one could make a legitimate argument that the quality keeping this movie from greatness is the lack of fire in Inman and Adas relationship. Give them the chemistry of Bogart and Bergman in Casablanca (or even Fiennes and Scott-Thomas in The English Patient) and this would have been an unforgettable motion picture. One thing that cannot be denied is the effectiveness of the films look. This is a gorgeous film to watch with deserved credit given to cinematographer John Seale who is an accomplished veteran behind the camera (he has shot about three-dozen pictures including The English Patient Gorillas in the Mist and Witness). Although the big battle near the beginning of the film has its share of logical flaws it is photographed in such a manner that you almost lose yourself in the spectacle of the moment. And the Romanian countryside is a workable double for mid-19th century North Carolina. Cold Mountain was adapted from the long complex novel by Charles Frazier and clearly proved to be a challenge for Minghella to capture on film. The movie has its share of structural problems and may be a little longer than seems necessary but it rarely lost my attention. I would not place this in the top echelon of end-of-the-year motion pictures but its certainly a successful adaptation features numerous memorable performances (mostly by the supporting players) and is worth a post-holiday expenditure of time and money.

Adapted from Charles Fraziers novel Cold Mountain is a studiously carpentered film with an Odyssey-through-the-backwoods vastness that is very pleasing yet I cant say I was deeply moved by one minute of it. Its a Civil War drama that has the flow the leisurely volatility of a sprawling ambitious Western; it takes place around the edges of battle and around the edges of love too. The movie hinges on a romance that is so refined - so abstract even - its fulfilled paradoxically through absence and thats one reason you may find yourself absorbed by ""Cold Mountain"" and still feel as if theres not enough there there. Inman (Jude Law) the virtuous fellow from the leafy Edenic slopes of Cold Mountain N.C. who joins and then deserts the Confederate army is separated for virtually the entire film from Ada (Nicole Kidman) the reverends daughter who shows up in her blond ringlets and flowered bonnet the vision of a cloistered Southern belle. Its a measure of what a sensational actor Law is that hes able to flirt up a storm with Kidman and at the same time look as if hes fighting to overcome a lifetime of hardwired shyness. Inman to put it mildly is a man of few words. When he takes a break atop the house hes helping to build and asks Ada for a glass of cider he sounds tentative a bit gruff but Ada knows its really the deepest chivalry at work. For a man this handsome the awkward refusal to be charming is the ultimate charm. Its hard to recall a courtship of such measured gentility and ""Cold Mountain"" heightens that delicacy by overlapping it with scenes set three years later of the Civil War at its most apocalyptic In 1864 at the siege of Petersburg Inman and his fellow troops are ambushed by explosives laid under their trenches. The carnage is brutal and shocking and as the smoke billows and the two sides go at each other with knife and claw we see a very different Inman his face streaked his eyes white with disillusion. Thats a huge jolting step for a hero to take - from the bashful blush of love to the hideous knowledge of battle. The peculiarity of ""Cold Mountain"" is that Inman undergoes that transformation quite fully within the films opening 20 minutes. As he escapes - or tries to - the wars chaos he wanders back home mile after mile through a combustible wilderness of blood and disorder. Some of his encounters have a malevolent and exciting force yet nothing that happens alters his slightly sullen demeanor of taciturn nobility. Inman doesnt deepen or grow or change. He simply survives fighting his way through one baroque danger after the next. As staged by the director Anthony Minghella the movie is a picaresque physical journey without a matching emotional one. Philip Seymour Hoffman shows up as a lecherous reverend who when Inman encounters him is trying to drown the teenage slave hes impregnated and Hoffman uses his special gift for making masochistic piggishness likable. Before long the two have wandered into the lair of a drunken hillbilly (Giovanni Ribisi) and his slovenly harem - the movies version of the island of Circe. Minghella as he proved in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" has a knack for introducing violent depravity into situations where you least expect it. The most wrenching episode is the one in which Inman is sheltered by a young mother (Natalie Portman) and their encounter with Union renegades reaches a crescendo of fear. As a deserter Inman is hidden behind a bushy beard his destiny linked to that of everyone he meets - at one point literally when he tumbles down a hill as part of a chain gang. His journey is paralleled by the fate of Ada who sustains him by writing chastely florid letters of devotion. Back in Cold Mountain she has no one to fend for her - at least until Renee Zellweger shows up as Ruby a farmhand who declares her presence by twisting off the head of a rooster. Zellweger drawling like a cousin of Jed Clampett waddles through the cornfields with amusingly speedy purpose. Her performance may be vintage Oscar ham but theres no denying that she floods the screen with personality. Kidman by contrast has been given little to do but tremble grandly; her Ada is like Scarlett OHara so cleansed of neurosis that you wish shed been left with at least a trace of it. For Ada and Inman love is really the promise of love the faith that sustains them through the dirty fallout of war. There has to be more to epic film characters though than the purity of their devotion. ""Cold Mountain"" does all it can to make you swoon and as watchable as the movie is thats just what doesnt happen.

Like Fraziers book the picture is framed as a road movie with a love story folded into it. While recovering from a neck wound sustained in that decisive battle a Confederate soldier named Inman (Jude Law) like so many of his fellow soldiers deserts and begins the long cross-country trek home on foot. Braving a savage vigilante Home Guard and many other dangers he heads for his native North Carolina where he hopes to find Ada the sweetheart he met just before he enlisted waiting for him. Law is better than you might imagine a young English hipster might be at portraying a Southerner. Stumbling along his handsome eyes dulled by the sight of too much death Inman is the embodiment of a man all but destroyed by war. Frazier is no sentimentalist The novels most prominent figure is not either of the lovers but nature itself a dark implacable force to be respected and constantly fought. Minghellas picture by contrast is bathed in the same golden glow that enveloped his other war picture The English Patient from which hes brought across almost his entire crew including cinematographer John Seale and editor Walter Murch. Cold Mountains most prominent -- and least convincing -- character is played by Nicole Kidman likely the last model Frazier had in mind when he created Ada an aloof raven-haired Charleston intellectual without a flirtatious bone in her body who nonetheless knows love when she sees it and goes for it. Kidman minces into view trailing a mane of long blond curls her eyes demurely downcast and her button mouth curled into a kittenish simper that rivals Vivien Leighs famous moue in Gone With the Wind.

Aug. 15 705pm Tamping down this Ada into a responsible farmer is clearly going to be a challenge and who more qualified for the task than Renee Zellweger who blows in -- entertainingly got up in rags and cussing like a disenfranchised rap artist -- as Ruby a hardscrabble country wench sans makeup who teaches Ada the art of making friends with the great outdoors. Zellweger looks like a big movie star roughing it a la Paris Hilton and as if this werent distracting enough the hills are alive with big acting names from both sides of the Atlantic who pop up as help or hindrance to Inmans pilgrims progress while straining with variable success for credible Southern twangs. Among them are Ray Winstone as the murderous Home Guard leader who wants Ada and her farm for himself; Philip Seymour Hoffman as an amoral priest who begins as Inmans %0 nemesis and ends up his companion; Eileen Atkins as an old crone who patches him up and sends him on his way; and Brendan Gleeson as Rubys feckless scamp of a dad. Pretty soon youre playing name that actor and the movie acquires the incongruous aspect of a latter-day Greek epic with each character standing in for a different Humor. All of which may account for the low emotional wattage in what ought to be a soaring romance. Minghella first made his name with the small but immensely satisfying Truly Madly Deeply and by his own account hes an old-fashioned movie romantic and not very interested in war stories. Yet by far the most stunning scenes in Cold Mountain are its violent encounters. As Minghellas canvas has grown larger his emotional register has grown fainter. I for one was baffled by the huge success of The English Patient in which Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas generated about as much heat as a couple of dead lizards. Cold Mountain does little better. Indeed it takes Natalie Portman as a young widow with a baby who takes Inman into her shack to work up a little chemistry. By the time this wandering Ulysses arrives home to his Penelope whos fetchingly tricked out in a mans suit he seems almost too tired for the obligatory sex scene. Cold Mountain chugs along placidly until it finally fizzles out with a warm and fuzzy picnic on a lovely summer day. I swear I heard Julie Andrews yodeling in the background.

""If you are fighting stop fighting"" Ada writes. ""If you are marching stop marching. Come back to me."" The command has a moral authority that overrules any that General Lee could issue and Inman must follow it. For the ultimate goal of many a warrior is to get home to his woman -- to lay down his arms and find comfort in hers. Charles Fraziers 1997 best seller Cold Mountain is The Odyssey compressed Ambrose Bierces An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge expanded to saga dimensions. As much as Inman aches to return to a woman he barely knew but knew he loved the novels vivid prose needed to be turned into moving pictures.

Now on the darker ruder landscape of 19th century North Carolina (though much of Cold Mountain was shot in Romania) he tells a story of the severest passion -- of a beautiful woman who learns strength and a strong man who discovers beauty and wont let it go. When Ada (Nicole Kidman) arrives in Cold Mountain with her preacher father (Donald Sutherland) her refinement startles the citizenry; they must reconfigure their notions of perfection. Inman (Jude Law) has never looked that high. His eye has been on the plow the nail to be hammered. But Ada and the approach of war bring a clarity to his ambitions. He wants her heart and she lets him pack it on his journey into battle. Now Inmans and Adas stories run on parallel tracks he warring getting wounded and walking homeward she fighting to survive in a mean economic and political climate. A proper lady with few practical skills Ada is saved by the arrival of the can-do mountain gal Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger). As Ada passes her Ruby Thewes days struggling to keep her farm from failing and the local bully Teague (Ray Winstone) from pressing his lurid attentions on her Inman meets all manner of strangers -- good witches and bad a rogue (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and a young widow (Natalie Portman). Inman shows how fleeing a war can be an act of love Ada how staying at home is an act of courage. The grimly detailed superbly staged Battle of the Crater -- the 1864 debacle that Minghella weaves into Fraziers plot -- reminds you that this is a Civil War movie. But of a blinkered nature Where are the slaves? Ahem where are the black folks? Minghella may be dodging the race issue (slavery is never mentioned) but he probably wants us to see the Confederacy both as one more lost cause worth fighting for then fighting to get out of and as a military metaphor for the impossible dream at the storys core -- one of rebellious love against all odds that is worth pursuing no matter how it ends. The acting is full of satisfactions and surprises. Law has movie-star musk and the craft to fill his peasant garb with a heroic sensitivity. Kidman seems uncomfortable early on but she takes strength from Adas plight and grows steadily literally luminous. Her sculptural pallor gives way to warm radiance in the firelight. Portman lends a tender ferocity to the widow aching for the presence -- the memory really -- of a good mans body next to hers. As for the Best Supporting Actress Oscar voting is now officially closed; Zellweger should take it by acclamation. Early in the film Adas father tells her ""I lost your mother after 22 months of marriage. It was enough for a lifetime."" The feeling this movie engenders could last a while too. For Cold Mountain no less than The Lord of the Rings is a grand and poignant movie epic about what is lost in war and whats worth saving in life. It is also a rare blend of purity and maturity -- the years most rapturous love story.

From the left flanks of Union soldiers charge across a muddy Virginia battlefield toward a horrible confrontation with their Confederate foes (""Cold Mountain""). From the right sword-wielding 19th-century samurai speed on their mounts across green Japanese knolls into the cannon fire of the emperors Army (""The Last Samurai""). From bottom to top seen from a flying Gods-eye view a numberless mass of human warriors streaks across the plains of Gondor as the even larger forces of Saurons army descend for the slaughter (""The Return of the King"").These panoramas are thrilling terrifying and expensive. Its been a long time since Hollywood has painted so many pictures on so grand a scale. For decades the historical epic was thought to be an extinct species left for dead back in the 60s when costly debacles like ""Cleopatra"" toppled entire studios then buried again in 1980 by ""Heavens Gate."" Hollywood liked to say the audience had lost its taste for the genre but that wasnt it. They were just too damn costly to make. Filmmakers who wanted 10000 extras and ancient coliseums had to wait for technology to catch up with their imaginations. It did--with computer-generated images. Suddenly you could get as many genies as you wanted out of one desktop bottle and they were affordable. ""Braveheart"" and ""Gladiator"" opened the floodgates. Now were on the high seas in ""Master amp; Commander"" and just over the horizon Brad Pitt and Colin Farrell are buckling on their Greek armor for ""Troy"" and ""Alexander the Great.""What the makers of these three martially minded holiday epics couldnt have foreseen was that their images of war and destruction would be fraught with a daily-headline resonance. This is particularly true of Anthony Minghellas stunning stately adaptation of Charles Fraziers Civil War odyssey ""Cold Mountain"" the one film that addresses the psychological impact of war. With vivid precision it shows what war can do to a person a community a country. Its the story of Inman (Jude Law) a disillusioned wounded Confederate soldier who rises from his hospital bed determined to walk home--no matter how long it takes--to North Carolina and Ada (Nicole Kidman) the woman he loves yet hardly knows. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Minghella grounds the high romanticism of the love story in the bloody muck of hand-to-hand combat. He opens his movie with the Battle of the Crater a nightmarish encounter in Petersburg Va. that left thousands dead. Its not in the book but it brilliantly evokes the inferno Inman is determined to escape. Minghella intercuts the battle with the bucolic town of Cold Mountain three years earlier when the taciturn Inman first met Ada Monroe a sheltered Southern belle. The sparks between Law and Kidman are palpable the contrast between her pastel gentility and the brutality of Petersburg as stark as a steel blade.""Cold Mountain"" is a movie of episodes and Minghella pulls off dazzling set pieces he knows how to infuse violence with emotion so it never seems gratuitous. If ""Cold Mountain"" runs the risk of self-importance the arrival of Renee Zellweger as the spunky dirt-encrusted drifter Ruby solves that problem. A gal who knows her way around a farm she moves in with the hapless Ada--left to her own devices after her fathers death--and teaches her how to survive. Ada in turn teaches Ruby there are more things in life than ripping the heads off roosters. Zellweger can push the ""Annie Get Your Gun"" swagger too hard but she mixes it up with sharp stabs of honest emotion. Its a daring delicious performance.Kidman deftly captures both Adas diffidence and her determination though I wish she didnt always look fresh out of the beauty parlor. In any case its Laws understated mesmerizing performance that carries the film and gives it its soul much as he carries his life-sustaining vision of Ada in his hopeful heart. As he did in ""The English Patient"" Minghella artfully weds movie-movie romanticism with a dark historical vision. The man knows how to cast a spell.The movie-movieness of Edward Zwicks ""The Last Samurai"" is of a different order everything in it seems filtered through other films--Hollywoods as well as Akira Kurosawas. Tom Cruise plays a drunken guilt-ridden Civil War vet who finds redemption in Bushido the ancient warrior code of the samurai. Cruise has been hired to go to Japan to train the emperors Army in the uses of Western arms to help stave off a samurai rebellion. But after hes taken prisoner by the samurai and nursed back to health in their idyllic mountain village he changes sides awed by the purity and nobility of their traditional ways. Substitute Native Americans for samurai and Ive just described ""Dances With Wolves.""Zwicks admiration for ancient Japanese culture is heartfelt--and woolly-headed. For the drama to work he has to turn everyone who supports the Westernization of Japan into a sneering villain. Surely the issues were a tad more complex than good guys vs. bad guys. And what is it with Zwicks zeal for noble sacrifice? Here as in ""Glory"" he asks us to be exalted by the spectacle of soldiers who suicidally march to an honorable death. I couldnt help thinking suicide bombers think theyre heroes too.Id be inclined to cut Zwick more slack if the movie didnt take itself so seriously and if Cruises transformation into a valiant warrior had some nuance. Theres no denying however the craftsmanship that has gone into this sumptuous epic. As an action director Zwick keeps getting better--the choreography of the fighting scenes is rousing. There are pleasures to be had in the handsome heroic ""The Last Samurai."" But theyre all on the surface.The pleasures of ""The Return of the King"" are too numerous to recount in brief. Now that the trilogy is complete we can take the full measure of Peter Jacksons extraordinary accomplishment. ""The Lord of the Rings"" stands as a model of epic storytelling. The final installment runs well over three hours but Jacksons modulations of tone space scale and intensity are so expertly gauged you never feel pummeled or bored. Just gripped from start to finish.""The Return of the King"" interweaves two strands one vast one intimate. In the former all the kingdoms of Middle-earth unite in an attempt to stave off Saurons armies of darkness and to restore Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) to the throne. This is the cast-of-thousands part full of swirling camera work can-you-top-this stunts and magnificent besieged cities. In the latter is the increasingly tortured weary figure of Frodo (Elijah Wood) as he enters the terrifying realm of Mordor where he must return the ring to the fire. On his hobbits back rests the fate of mankind. Weve known that from the beginning. In the third and final film we feel it.The second installment was better than the first and this one is best of all. It has spectacular action scenes and imaginary creatures and its by far the most moving chapter. The performances have deepened. These characters dont pop back up like cartoon figures unscraped by experience. Theyve been altered by their quest and the hurt gives flavor to the glory. If theres a flaw in this jewel its a generous one Jackson gives us too many endings. Understandably he wants to be faithful to Tolkien. Or maybe like us he just couldnt tear himself away.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

A challenging literary adaptation is tackled with skill and smarts in ""Cold Mountain."" An involving drama about a young Confederate soldiers precarious voyage home after having his fill of the Civil War Anthony Minghellas follow-up to his imposing predecessors ""The English Patient"" and ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" is a grim picaresque odyssey across a beautiful scarred landscape laced together by private romantic longing. Handsomely made and vividly acted this large gamble by Miramax will likely receive the sort of supportive reviews and year-end attention it needs to connect with the intended discerning mass audience resulting in solid domestic B.O. especially in more upscale markets and perhaps better in many foreign territories. Doing judicious restructuring and carefully picking events to dramatize Minghella has manfully grappled with Charles Fraziers dense 1997 surprise bestseller a winner of the National Book Award among other kudos. Aside from well representing the novel the picture also echoes ""The English Patient"" in important respects notably in its depiction of separated lovers during a convulsive war men recovering from serious wounds and characters with literary bents. At the same time this relatively rare major film to focus on the Civil War is obviously inspired by Homers ""The Odyssey"" with a warrior encountering myriad characters and odd situations on his long way back to the woman who faithfully waits for him through the years. And some will be put in mind of such cinematic romantic epics as ""Doctor Zhivago"" and ""Reds"" although ""Cold Mountain"" is mostly too chaste to be classified with any of these more passion-driven tales. As such ""Cold Mountain"" is a film that may command respect and approval more than it will inspire ardent public enthusiasm. It opens with its most sobering scene a concentrated evocation of the Siege of Petersburg Va. in July of 1864 in which the Union initiates the slaughter with the startling tactic of blowing up Rebel troops with dynamite laid out in tunnels beneath them. Thereafter Minghella uses mostly close-ups to emphasize the chaos and massive human loss as blood increasingly reddens the mud not even bothering to note the outcome of the clash. One of the Southern soldiers who fights bravely and well goes by the single name of Inman (Jude Law) and even as the battle rages the film cuts back to a quieter moment three years earlier when Inman a handsome carpenter in a small North Carolina town met the beauteous Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) the daughter of an old preacher (Donald Sutherland) just arrived from Charleston to lead to local parish. Very tentatively the reserved young man and the refined young lady make one anothers acquaintance and at any other time things between them would undoubtedly have taken their natural course over a proper period. But war fever is rampant in the South and its only in the minute before Inman rushes to join his fellow townsmen to march off to war that he passionately kisses Ada who in turn promises to wait for him. In their voiced-over correspondence (most of it never received) and in their eventual conversation both Inman and Ada reflect upon how they barely know each other. And yet their feelings are enough to not only keep them single-mindedly devoted throughout the war but to motivate them to survive no matter the calamities that befall them in the interim. Back in 1864 after the battle Inman recovered from a near-fatal neck injury decides hes done and seen enough killing and lights out from the hospital to head home. As a deserter Inman must now be wary of all troops Union or Confederate. In a very effective scene that parallels the beginning of Inmans odyssey Ada takes friends advice to look into a well through a mirror to glimpse the future and is startled to see the presumed image of a man walking toward her surrounded by black crows. When her father dies things go rapidly downhill for Ada. Raised in society to speak French and Latin and to conduct herself in a ladylike manner Ada is utterly ill-equipped to cope at the farm on her own. Without funds and unable even to cook she starts wasting away until a neighbor sends over a young woman to work for her and put things right. This is Ruby (Renee Zellweger) and the picture gets a shot in the arm the moment this bundle of can-do energy comes bounding onscreen 50 minutes in. Abandoned by her father years before uncouth and essentially illiterate Ruby still knows how to do everything Ada cant manage like pulling a roosters head off so they can eat something planting a field and working ceaselessly from dawn till dusk to make sure theyre prepared for the winter. Ruby would win any season of ""Survivor"" without raising a sweat. Acknowledging the uselessness of her education in the circumstances Ada willingly becomes Rubys student while playing piano and helping her with reading in off-hours. Entrancingly enacted by Zellweger and Kidman relationship between the two women provides the story with its strongest positive dynamic in a world dominated by conflict suspicion and violence. Latter are just what Inman encounters with nearly every step. Spotting an anguished reverend named Veasey (Philip Seymour Hoffman) about to dump a black girl into a river Inman rescues her learns that the pastor had made her pregnant and executes his own proper justice by tying Veasey up in town and posting a note describing his crime. When they meet again later Veasey forgives Inman as they embark on a drunken evening that ends with the pair captured by a Confederate officer and marched off on a chain gang. Episodic nature of the material cannot be disguised but its eased by the adroit alternation between scenes of Inmans journey and developments with the women on the home front. With a Southern defeat now inevitable activities are stepped up by the Home Guard trigger-happy enforcers who roam the countryside ferreting out deserters and those who aid them. In the Cold Mountain area the posse is headed by Teague (Ray Winstone) a bitter man who would like to reclaim the vast local lands his family formerly owned and is more than distracted by Adas beauty. While the arrival of Rubys long-lost father Stobrod (Brendan Gleeson) throws a monkey wrench into the womens lives Inmans days continue to be eventful. Eileen Atkins wonderfully terse performance as an old hermit who heals Inman reps a thesping highlight and Natalie Portman figures in one of the most alarming episodes as Sara a lonely young war widow and mother who gives Inman shelter for a night but is attacked by Union soldiers in the morning. ""Man dead woman left"" is Saras assessment of the effects of the war and remark reps an accurate indication of the storys intensely personal character-driven orientation. Pic makes virtually no reference to politics the issues that caused the war or whats at stake. Even less than in the book slaves and black characters are observed only in passing and there are no pipe-sucking Southern colonels in rocking chairs lamenting the passing of the old ways. All this is fine and well but also missing is a real feeling of the Old South a deep sense of the mores and attitudes and manner of living that knitted the people together. Despite the extensive original research by author Frazier that backs everything up the verisimilitude of the sets and the evident care thats gone into every aspect of the production there is an intangible something missing in the portrait of the society. Its impossible to say whether this stems from the fact that the film was mostly shot in Romania from its being made mostly by foreigners or from the variability of the accents by a significantly Anglo-Aussie cast but theres something of a void at the bottom of things where bedrock ought to be. Films romantic bets pay off when Inman finally arrives at Cold Mountain and reunites with Ada. But his presence there where only one in 10 men are thought to have survived the war makes him more conspicuous than ever and significantly more blood must be shed on the way to the tales melancholy end. Playing in an appealing low-key style that positions Inman as a thoughtful alert young man whos highly principled but also able to do whatever needs to be done to survive Law strikes a fine balance between his characters shell-shocked weariness and his gritty determination to stay alive; Inman could easily have been too recessive a man to whom things happen or too gung-ho in his overcoming obstacles but Law combines the traits very credibly. In a role that could have been a helpless wilting lily for quite a while Kidman supplies all manner of subtle inflections and increasingly radiant expressions that keep Ada interesting and make her grow which she does through her relationship with Ruby and then moreso when Inman returns. For some time after Rubys arrival theres nothing any actress could do to prevent Zellweger from stealing every scene; the latter literally bounces across the landscape and reacts with comic gumption to any situation that confronts her. Nor does it hurt that Zellweger is the only authentic Southerner among the principal cast. Acting is colorful down the line with Gleeson contributing a warmly dimensional portrait of Rubys errant father newly willing to toe the line Hoffman providing larger-than-life gusto in his portrayal of the wayward preacher and Winstone projecting menace without even opening his mouth. Ace editor Walter Murch helped bring in the picture at a length that feels right for the story being told. No matter where it was shot the film looks impressive and right with production designer Dante Ferrettis hodgepodge of buildings creating a convincing community in a small valley Ann Roth and Carlo Poggioli contributing a fine variety of textures through the costumes and lenser John Seale proving nimbly responsive to both the panoramic and intimate demands of the material. Special mention must go to the musical elements in which Gabriel Yareds supple melodic score sometimes heightened by choral work is joined by a fascinating array of songs both traditional and new overseen by executive music producer T-Bone Burnett composed by the likes of Sting and Elvis Costello and performed by such artists as Alison Krauss and cast member Jack White. Like the soundtracks for ""The English Patient"" and ""Ripley"" this one should make its mark.
