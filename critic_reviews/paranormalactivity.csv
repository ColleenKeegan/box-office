"Paranormal Activity reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Paranormal Activity reviewed. Paranormal Activity reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Oct. 30 2009 1137 AM Paranormal Activity A parable about the credit crisis and unthinking consumerism. By Dana Stevens Katie Featherstone and Micha Sloat in Paranormal The surprise success of the microbudget indie horror film Paranormal Activity (Paramount Pictures) constitutes one of those pop-culture moments when you realize that mass taste is sometimes better than you give it credit for. This may not be the horror movie of the year--that crown still easily goes to Sam Raimis similarly themed Drag Me to Hell--but its good enough that its unexpected popularity is heartening. In a genre where a fresh mutilated corpse every 15 minutes has become a reasonable expectation this slow-paced but relentless spooker is refreshingly un-extreme. It comes by its screams honestly earning them with incremental at times agonizing gradations of old-fashioned whats-that-noise-in-the-hallway suspense. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Though its a retro haunted-house movie at heart Paranormal Activity is formally postmodern departing from the same found-footage conceit as The Blair Witch Projectand Cloverfield. A title tells us that ""[t]he families of Katie Featherstone and Micah Sloat"" have authorized the use of the images were about to see. As it turns out those are both the real-life names of the actors and the character names of the couple were about to spend 86 claustrophobic minutes with. Micah and Katie live together in San Diego in a house that while not a mansion is pretty swank for a couple in their 20s two stories three bedrooms a backyard pool. (Ill get back to the significance of their apparent financial comfort later.) Advertisement In the first scene Micah is setting up a home video camera in their bedroom to Katies mild protests. Theyve been hearing some weird noises at night around the house and Micah wants to prove to her that the creaks and rustlings are nothing but normal house-settling sounds (not that he seems all that confident himself). All night every night the camera sits fixed at their bedside as they sleep through a crescendo of unexplainable events. Doors open and close. Chandeliers swing. Bedclothes ruffle. None of this is sufficiently horrifying to run screaming out of the house about but its enough to convince Micah to continue with the nightly recording just in case. The couples mutual conviction that the haunting is sort of like a mouse infestation a niggling household problem to keep on top of is one of the funnier things about Paranormal Activity which doubles in its less scary moments as a domestic comedy. Micah trails Katie around with the camera as they squabble and bargain (he for on-camera sex she for a moment of privacy). As the creepy nocturnal happenings escalate each proposes a different solution She wants to call in a demonologist to exorcise the place (an approach that by this films logic seems as rational and sound as getting a yearly mammogram). He wants to consult a Ouija board--not a popular idea with either Katie her best friend or the demon itself who when the couple has stepped out for dinner one night sets the offending occult object on fire. The writer/director first-timer Oren Peli bides his time to a sadistic degree revealing only as much about the poltergeist as we need to know to keep us anxious. Katie has felt followed by an evil spirit since her house burned down in childhood. (Cut to the events of night No. 8.) A psychic she calls in for a consultation refuses to stay in the house. (Cut to night No. 9.) A childhood photograph of Katie--one that should have disappeared in that long-ago fire--surfaces in the attic. (Cut to night No. 10.) The film is rhythmically punctuated by these long static shots of the couple sleeping and we come to dread the nights as much as they do. When youre watching time-lapse film of two people asleep in a dark room its surprising how little it takes to scare you The image of Katie getting out of the bed and standing stock-still next to it as the hours fast-forward past is inexplicably unsettling. Thats all Ill say of the minimalist plot except to observe that unless I misunderstood the ending completely the last few seconds are a bit of a letdown. But since Paranormal Activity has been so widely discussed already--opinion is sharply divided--Id like to end this review with my own possibly crackpot reading of the film as allegory for the credit crisis. As mentioned above Micah and Katie live quite nicely for a couple of their age. His job is described only as ""day trader"" Katies as ""student"" and during the 20 or so days of home movies we witness we never see either leaving the house for work or school. Even if the couple flees the house their overleveraged dollars have bought Katies childhood demon will catch up with her eventually as will Micahs hubris about solving the haunting problem with no help from anyone else. Both of them--especially the day-trading night-filming Micah--consistently overestimate their own ability to understand and manage the forces that threaten them. And the apparent consumerist complacency of the movies opening--as Micah fires up his new camera for the first time Katie teases him about how much it must have cost--soon gives way to a far harsher focus on day-to-day survival. Though it never poses a question more abstract than ""Wheres that scratching sound coming from?"" Paranormal Activity is all about spiritual and ethical debts coming due. As we watch the doomed couple fall asleep night after night we ask what the day traders never asked themselves How long can they keep pretending everythings all right?

The Spiel- berg-anointed horror flick goes in ""demand"" wide release Friday.By Tirdad Derakhshani Inquirer Staff WriterPosted October 13 2009Paranormal Activity a hyper-low-budget haunted-house horror flick from first-time director Oren Peli has changed filmmaking forever - if you believe the hype.An impressive not entirely successful exercise in minimalist filmmaking the faux-documentary is about a twentysomething couple besieged by a demon.It has an interesting one-man-with-a-camera gimmick and it delivers some real thrills - without any gore and virtually no violence.Thats no mean feat considering that Peli shot the film entirely in his own house over seven days - using just a home video camera - for the ludicrous bargain-basement cost of 15000.Ironically the story behind his film has proven more interesting than the flick itself. If Paranormal is anything its a masterpiece of promotion.The media cant stop talking about the film. It has been dubbed a phenomenon and compared to the 1999 low-budget sleeper hit The Blair Witch Project. (At 100000 the budget for Blair was substantially higher.)Stories have recounted with almost mystical awe how Dreamworks boss and mega-director Steven Spielberg was so moved (and frightened) by the film he helped greenlight a big-budget remake to be directed by Peli. But producers were sufficiently impressed by test screenings they opted to release the original version instead.Paramount Pictures began a PR push in September by showing the film in 13 college towns across the country. It invited fans via eventful.com to ""demand"" it be released in their town. Once a million fans voted online for the film it would get a general release.By Oct. 3 the film was selling out at 33 locations in 20 markets. On Friday the film which had grossed 1.6 mil was expanded to 44 markets including Philly. It went on to become the fifth-highest-grossing film over the weekend making 7.1 mil.Paramount announced the millionth fan voted online for the film on Saturday so the film will get a general release across the country on Friday.The studios carefully executed viral campaign created the powerful illusion that interest in the film was building entirely on word-of-mouth. (The intense media coverage didnt hurt either.)Some fans outside a screening Friday in West Philly said the flick had underground cred.""Its an indie movie"" explained Havertowns Anthony Schrader 22. ""Its had less filtering by Hollywood which always suger-coats mainstream horror.""Isabelle Trudeau 30 and Pablo Delion 28 of Phillys City Avenue area said they decided to see Paranormal after hearing radio coverage of the film-as-phenom.Similar reports on MTV motivated self-described West Oak Lane horror film fanatics Tuesday Carroll 38 and her three teenage daughters. ""It looks really scary"" Carroll said laughing. ""We heard it was like the scariest movie.""Fans were mostly positive. ""I think she had her eyes shut for a lot of it"" said Cody Felton 23 of Quakertown pointing to his companion Tessa Horst 22 who was visiting from Boston.""Well half of it"" Horst said laughing. ""Ive never seen a movie this scary before.""Felton who heard about Paranormal on the radio said the film worked because ""it seemed so realistic unlike your typical horror movie. It actually seemed as if it could really happen which made it so much scarier.""South Phillys John Colter 21 wasnt so convinced. ""I didnt like it. I dont like movies that are like Blair Witch. It was just boring"" he said. He admitted the film ""was a little freaky. . . . [But] it was like OK the door moved a little. ""Paranormals success hangs on the suspense Peli builds around that very door and other everyday objects in the three-bedroom San Diego house shared by the films heroes Micah (Micah Sloat) and Katie (Katie Featherston).As the film opens Micah a twentysomething day trader has decided to use a video camera to record strange phenomena that seem to occur when he and Katie are asleep.A psychic (Mark Fredrichs) tells the couple a demon is targeting them and advises they not fight or express anything that would emanate negative energy avoid angering or goading the demon and never try to contact it.Of course Micah breaks all three rules. Things get worse.A lot worse.Peli is to be congratulated for pulling off such an audacious project but he needs a sharper sense of timing The films pacing is uneven which weakens the suspense.His characterization is also a bit off Micah is an intensely unlikable hero who acts like an obnoxious pubescent.He seems to have an obsessive need to prove hes a virile man always in control. He dismisses Katies very real fears and announces hell beat the brimstone out of the demon. But as Katie tells him at one point Micah is as impotent as a man can get.By the films end we pray the demon does something really nasty to him.Paranormal Activity  (out of four stars)Directed by Oren Peli.

Less is usually more when it comes to scary movies. ""Paranormal Activity"" re portedly made for a pit tance of 11000 delivers more shocks and shudders than most flicks costing 1000 times that. Like legendary producer Val Lewton in the 40s writer-director Oren Peli who shot ""Paranormal"" in seven days in his own home understands that whats most frightening is what you dont see -- but which is merely suggested. Theres nothing but the briefest glimpse of blood or violence here -- and nothing but the crudest (but highly effective) visual and sound effects. Yet I felt hairs standing up on the back of my neck as the film slowly built to a series of shocks that had a preview audience screaming and laughing nervously. Employing the same sort of supposedly found camcorder footage (though less shaky) as ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""Cloverfield"" the film depicts a tense three-week period in late 2006. Micah (Micah Sloat) an entitled day trader has just bought the camera in an attempt to record things going bump in the night at the two-story tract house in San Diego that he has recently moved into with his girlfriend Katie (Katie Featherston). Katie who has had problems with paranormal events in the past brings in an expert who warns the couple not to anger the ghost or demon thats taken up residence in their home. Micah though thinks it would be fun to capture the phenomena on tape. Its not giving anything away to say this is a bad idea. Defying Katie and bringing in a Ouija board is probably an even worse idea. Doors open suddenly lights flicker on and off in the middle of the night we hear footsteps. Is that a shadow? And what exactly is going on in their bed while theyre sleeping? Its been a long time since I saw an audience react so viscerally to a film. There were literally gasps when a character walked off into darkness. On the downside there are long dull stretches especially in the beginning. The film which has no music except a brief burst from a computer would be even more effective if it were 15 minutes shorter. Even so ""Paranormal Activity"" creates a highly effective mood and a pervasive sense of dread. The films greatest assets are strong performances by whats basically a two-person cast. Sloat is effectively obnoxious as Micah with Featherston even better as the increasingly high-strung Katie. I wont say anything about the ending except to say its much scarier than ""The Blair Witch Project"" -- and report that a substantial portion of the audience spent five minutes staring at a blank screen at the end waiting to see if it was really over. ""Paranormal Activity"" may indeed be the phenomenon for which Paramount is hoping.

Despite obvious terrifying physical evidence they refuse to consult an expert - until its too late.In ""Paranormal Activity an invisible force bedevils San Diegans Katie (Katie Featherston) and Micah (Micah Sloat) and they battle back chronicling the entitys every offense with HD video equipment. ""This is my house nothings gonna mess with my girlfriend Micah vows as Katie retreats to their no-longer-private bedroom.Claustrophobic to a fault the movie would have audiences believe - as claimed in the opening title card - that the footage that follows is real. Only the very young and fans of TV programming like ""The Hills will find this credible.A ""Blair Witch Project-like sensation at the 2008 Slamdance Film Festival the movie has since been streamlined by 10 minutes by Paramount Pictures which has looked to build buzz with a series of midnight screenings. Unlike ""Blair Witch which captured the panic of being lost in dark woods ""Paranormal Activity finds mild unease and shocks in an underfurnished home. Even at 85 minutes the movie contains maybe 50 minutes that scare.For too long Micahs multimedia project reflects only Katies simmering resentment of the camera; Featherstons expression switches from teasing to ticked off. Lights flicker curtains ruffle groans come from upstairs and down. Meanwhile the frisky couple bicker over whether to turn off the camera and flee (shes for it) or to summon the recommended demonologist (hes dead set against). Its like watching a YouTube clip of your irritating neighbors knee deep in muck as they argue the effectiveness of plumbers.Despite some unsettling nighttime scenes seen through Micahs ever-watchful viewfinder ""Paranormal Activity lets the mood of domestic dread slip away until its whammo final scene. In those lost minutes too many doubts can creep in as to whats behind all the scratches and bangs and whether director Oren Peli isnt secretly pro-infestation.

Starring Katie Featherston Micah Sloat Randy McDowell Ashley Palmer Director Oren Peli Running time 126 Release Opened Oct 2 2009  Editorial Review In Paranormal Activity Fear Factor Runs HighBy Jen ChaneyWashington Post Staff WriterMonday Oct. 12 2009""Paranormal Activity"" has emerged as the out-of-nowhere sensation of the fall season. Its the sleeper hit that makes audiences too petrified to ever sleep again.Having attained its goal of logging one million online ""demands"" from fans who voted to bring the movie to their respective towns (and after earning an unprecedented 8 million on fewer than 200 screens around the country) ""Paranormal Activity"" officially opens in wide release Oct. 16 just in time to further harness the power of social media and lure even more eager-to-be-unsettled parties into theaters before Halloween. But as fascinating as the movies promotional strategy and its corresponding Twitter chatter may be what people really want to know is this Is ""Paranormal Activity"" really that scary?The answer? Yes as long as youre patient. This genuinely chilling low-budget indie -- shot back in 2006 by first-time filmmaker Oren Peli -- tells the story of a demonic force plaguing a grad student and by extension her boyfriend within the claustrophobic walls of their sparsely furnished San Diego home. ""You cant run from this"" a psychic helpfully tells Katie (Katie Featherston) who has been haunted by eerie disturbances since childhood in one of the movies opening scenes. ""It will follow you."" So much for trying to thwart this thing by making a Starbucks run.Katies gadget-obsessed boyfriend Micah (Micah Sloat who like Featherston is making his film debut here) decides the couples best defense against this alleged force is a well-placed camera. So he rigs one up in their bedroom and attempts to document exactly what happens during the wee hours after the pair has tucked into their fluffy king-sized comforter.At first little registers. One night they get audio of a faint rumbling sound. On another they record a door moving by itself. And eventually after the overly confident Micah ignores the psychics warnings and gets his hands on a Ouija board things get really freaky.Pelis approach with its purposely amateurish camerawork dimly lit bedroom scenes and the implication that the footage we are seeing is ""real"" borrows more than a few pages from the ""Blair Witch Project"" playbook. But it works.The films suspense like ""Blair Witchs"" is the sort that lurks in shadows forcing viewers to strain their eyes to see what exactly is creeping into Katies and Micahs bedroom while they slumber. Admittedly the most horrifying scenes -- and truly a couple of them will inject sub-zero temperatures directly into your spine like some sort of arctic epidural -- come during the last 20 minutes of the movie a fact that may frustrate those who expect at least a couple of payoffs before the halfway point. But those scenes are effective precisely because of their tardiness. Peli intentionally lets us watch night after night as Katie and Micah retire for the evening and brace for the worst. Sometimes nothing happens at all. Sometimes they wake up in the morning and simply find that a set of car keys has inexplicably moved. All of those mundane moments lull the viewer into a false sense of security so that the shocks when they finally come hit hard. Yes some may find a few quibbles rattling around in their brains afterward. (Example If Micah is so tech-savvy why doesnt he stream these videos on the Internet so someone could potentially see whats happening in real time and intervene?) And a few steely stubborn souls may even insist that the movie didnt really creep them out that much. But those people should not be surprised later post-""Paranormal"" if they find themselves wide awake in bed at 3 a.m. certain that they hear a faint low-frequency rumble coming from downstairs the sound of a demon waiting to make his mark.Paranormal Activity -- R 99 minutes. Contains the kind of language most of us would use if harassed by demons. Area theaters.

"Paranormal Activity Your stomach will be terrified | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsOpinionParanormal Activity Your stomach will be terrifiedThis tale is frightening and it may be the best homage to Blair Witch but your stomach may be the final judge whether thats good or bad.A scene from Paranormal Activity.  (HANDOUT PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Oct. 9 20092.5 stars (out of four)Starring Katie Featherston Micah Sloat and Michael Bayouth. Written and directed by Oren Peli. At AMC Yonge-Dundas. (14A)Is Paranormal Activity the scariest movie of all time as the clever marketers at Paramount Pictures want us to believe?Not by a long shot. This poltergeist tale is frightening though and it may be the best homage to (or ripoff of) The Blair Witch Project since that shaky-cam shocker set the bar for low-budget horror a decade ago. Your stomach may be the final judge whether thats a good or bad thing.Im writing this in a darkened and silent house at 3 a.m. Friday having attended the films midnight Toronto premiere at the AMC Yonge-Dundas where witching-hour screenings will be the rule all through the Thanksgiving weekend (perhaps expanding to more sensible hours after that).Im not feeling the least bit spooked or haunted as Steven Spielberg apparently was after he had a look at writer/director Oren Pelis lo-fi pulse-raiser which was made for a reported 15000 (U.S.) and which has been stalking the festival circuit for the past two years. I do however have a headache and a slightly nauseous stomach nothing that Alka-Seltzer wont fix. I blame this on the relentlessly awful camera work in Paranormal Activity which is intended to look deliberately amateurish and which I judge to be worse than in Blair Witch Cloverfield and similar shaky-cam efforts. Results may vary in your personal lab experiment but consider this a serious warning to those with timorous tummies.Paranormal Activity apes the found-footage conceit of Blair Witch so much it even copies that films stark title cards suggesting its not really a movie but rather some kind of forensic police investigation into a terrible event.Without explanation we are plunged immediately into the haunting which on-screen dates indicate occurred in the fall of 2006.An unmarried San Diego couple named Micah and Katie (played by Micah Sloat and Katie Featherston) are talking about the camera Micah has just purchased to document unexplained events and noises in their new home.The slightly arrogant Micah is being manly by pooh-poohing the disturbances which could just be the work of a noisy refrigerator or pesky neighbours kids. A bit of a techno-geek and well paid as a day trader (this is pre-crash) Micah is convinced that technology will provide answers.Katie tolerates the intrusion of the camera because she fears the strange occurrences are more than just figments of her imagination or mundane household noises.At night they station the camera on a tripod in their bedroom. It maintains silent sentry marked by a time code of all things that do or dont go bump in the night.At first not much happens. Slowly however things start to pick up. A door moves by itself and then other things start to move. Each time theres a sound like the distant rumble of a subway train.The couple contacts a psychic (Michael Bayouth) who immediately feels the negative vibes. He tells them that the eerie presence is real and that resistance is futile ""You cannot run from this. It will find you.""We learn more about Katie and Micah and also some speculation as to why this is happening.Ill let your mind wander as to where all this leads but the action remains confined to the house and its grounds. If youre a horror fan you probably wont be astonished.On the other hand the film is frequently chilling. I heard more than a few ""omigods"" in the theatre audience and people jumped at a few scenes.Its clever stuff but as I wrote about Cloverfield a couple of years back it would seem a lot more clever if this were 1999 and Blair Witch hadnt already happened. Savvy studio marketers have pushed Paranormal Activity into a word-of-mouth hit backed by an innovative Internet balloting campaign that has goosed its gotta-see quotient.The people most scared by Paranormal Activity may be the makers of high-priced special effects who will have to explain to studio bosses how a kid with 15000 and one or two cameras can create such effective terror.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius Spike Jonze puts his own poignant spin on Where the Wild Things Are. _ By David Edelstein Published Oct 12 2009 ShareThis (Photo Matt Nettheim/Courtesy of Warner Bros. Entertainment) What an impossible task Spike Jonze has set for himself adapting one of the few works that can be confidently called perfect. Maurice Sendaks illustrated childrens book Where the Wild Things Are is the tale of a little boys tantrum and his fed-up mothers rejection and of the dream that transports him over the sea in his wolf pajamas to a land of monsters that crown him king and help him act out all his rowdy infantile impulsesuntil the rage goes out of his system melancholy comes and he longs to return home. The huge creatures are right on the border between stuffed-animal cuddlesome and mythically grotesque. Childlike fantasies in Sendaks world are always double-edged They can liberate you or eat you upor both. Jonzes film is a different animal from Sendaks. Its tamer and more domesticated and its characters come with a backstory. As with many compact works to expand is to decompress and diminish. Jonze who wrote the script with Dave Eggers fills in too much of the life of Max (played by Max Recordshis real name fancy that) now a lonely casualty of his parents divorce who freaks out when his mom (Catherine Keener) gets frisky with a date (Mark Ruffalo). One alteration is unpardonable Max dashes out of the house and into the woods instead of getting sent to bed without supper so there are no bedroom walls melting away and no waves rolling inone of the books most archetypal images. No warm supper awaits Maxs return. What can you say? Bad adapters bad. But once the boy is in his boat being tossed on the waves things go swimmingly. Thats when Jonzes Where the Wild Things Are begins to cast a spell all its own. Jonze and Eggerss most agreeable innovation is turning Sendaks rather anonymous beasts into complex conflicted personalities. They sit around quarreling smashing things making holes in trees staring into space and wishing for a leader. Theyre like a counterculture commune after all the hippies and their woks have left after the drugs have stopped working so well. And then comes little Max who proclaims himself a king to keep them from devouring him. Max Records (I still cant get over that name) has a mop of dark hair and a sweet face but his Max is petulant and edgy. Its a wonderful performance; youd never know he was acting opposite nine-foot puppets. If youve seen the previews you know that the setting is real (its the rocky coast of Australia) and the creatures are decidedly not. The mix of an unruly landscape a live boy and kiddie-show fakery shouldnt jellor should jell only on the level of a Muppet movie. But it works like a dream. Instead of being bombarded by computer illusions were allowed to suspend our disbelief to bring our own imaginations into play. For all the artfulness the feel of the film is rough-hewn almost primitive. Its a fabulous tree house of a movie. There is CGI but its largely used for the creatures expressions. Outside of Gollum Ive never seen facial movements so evocative. Jonze rehearsed the voice actors together instead of taping them separately (by way of comparison Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres didnt meet until the premiere of Finding Nemo) and theyre like a crack repertory company. Catherine OHara is Judith who sounds like a whiskey-soaked biker momma; Paul Dano is Alexander the woebegone little guy with ram horns whos always ignored. James Gandolfini has tender plaintive cadences (all New Jersey gangster inflection expunged) as Carol the tempestuous lummox whose stringy-haired hippie-chick girlfriend K.W. (Lauren Ambrose) has left him. Carol needs a king a firm dad someone to direct his wayward energies. Hes the one who asks Max if he can keep all the sadness away and Max says he has a sadness shielda mistake in a world of such up ups and down downs. Im of two minds about how Jonze and Eggers go soft in the end. These wild things dont turn carnivorous when Max wants to leave. They act more like the Scarecrow the Cowardly Lion etc. But this isnt Sendaks Where the Wild Things Are and the creatures arent projections of Maxs id. Theyre a family which is what this fatherless boy needs. They dont eat their own. Like The Blair Witch Project the micro-budget horror picture Paranormal Activity proves that nothing is scarier than nothing. Think of a creak in the dark. You freeze. You wait. And wait. Its the waiting thats unbearable. What you dont know can hurt you. The perspective is radically limited We see everything through the video camera of Micah (Micah Sloat) a San Diego day trader. After his live-in girlfriend Katie (Katie Featherston) reports noises in the night and a malevolent presence he decides to document the goings-on. And that allows the director Oren Peli his one genius setup. Micah places the camera in their bedroom with a view of the bed and door and dark hall leading to the stairway. The couple turns off the light and goes to sleep. The image is pale greenish and white. Theres a timer on the screen 132 a.m. and 40 seconds 41 42 43 Then theres a low rumble faint sounds of walking or running. Sometimes Katie and Micah dont wake upthey watch the footage the next day. Or theres a thud and Micah jumps up and grabs the camera and hurries into the hall a little orb of light illuminating a corner or railing. Or he points the camera down the stairs into the darkness. A medium gives the couple the name of a demonologist but macho Micah wants to take care of this himself. He yells things into the dark like Is that all you got? We want to yell to Katie Call the demonologist now and dump the asshole 1 2 Next Share this story...

(Neoclassics Films) BY Elizabeth Weitzman Joe Neumaier DAILY NEWS MOVIE CRITICS Friday October 9 2009 941 AM The Damned United4 starsBiopic about a legendary British soccer coach. At Lincoln Square and Union Square 14 (138). R Language. Just as a great player can take an average team to surprising heights Michael Sheen turns an ordinary sports movie into an unexpected winner.Sheen -- so unfairly taken for granted in ""Frost/Nixon"" and ""The Queen"" -- gets an overdue spotlight playing Brian Clough one of Englands best-known soccer coaches in the 1960s and 70s. The story of his rise and fall as the manager of Leeds United is portrayed with evident affection by director Tom Hooper and co-stars Colm Meaney and Timothy Spall. But ultimately its Sheen finding new facets of his character in every scene who shoots and scores. Elizabeth WeitzmanGood Hair3 starsDocumentary about African-American hairstyles. At area theaters (135). PG-13 Language including sex and drug references. Whether you have good hair or not theres plenty to appreciate in Chris Rocks rollicking documentary about what goes on when African-American women hit the salon.Rock turns his premise into an exploration of race gender and culture asking why women (and the occasional man) agree to put damaging chemicals on their heads spend thousands to weave in someone elses hair and pay global corporations for the privilege. He never wades too deep into tough subjects but he and his interviewees -- including Maya Angelou and Al Sharpton -- consistently keep things both entertaining and enlightening. E.W.Paranormal Activity3 starsTwo people are haunted by a demon. At area theaters (121). R Language.A ""Blair Witch""-y creepshow that owes a lot to Japanese horror this bare-bones flick has become a mini-phenom thanks to sold-out midnight shows across the country. ""Found"" video footage shows a couple trying to catch the demon thats been haunting Katie (Katie Featherston) since childhood. What does it want? Not a date thats for sure. Some wild moments make it all worth it.Joe NeumaierAdventures of Power2 starsComedy about an air-drumming geek. At the Village 7 (129). PG-13 Language. Its hard to say why Adrian Grenier would have signed on for Ari Golds aggressively quirky indie comedy. (Perhaps because his ""Entourage"" agent coincidentally shares Golds name?) As the egotistical superstar who challenges our pathetic hero (Gold) on his quest for air-drum glory Grenier brings some much-needed professionalism. But its not the rough edges that bother here; its the desperate attempt to capture ""Napoleon Dynamites"" success by relying on oddball characters and off-the-wall scenarios.Gold does put some heart into his characters single-minded mission. Mostly though youll appreciate Grenier who approaches this minor project with hilarious and generous abandon.E.W.Trucker3 starsA womans trucking life changes when shes reintroduced to her son. At the Village East (133). R Sexuality language. Writer-director James Motterns drama has a lived-in feel but is notable mainly for Michelle Monaghans glam-less turn as Diane a female truck driver and Nathan Fillions honest portrayal of amiable American guy-ness. When Dianes 11-year-old son returns to her life the script goes nowhere new -- but Monaghan gets how people with honky-tonk souls move in mysterious ways. J.N.Free Style2 starsA high school grad sets his sights on motocross racing. At the Empire 25 and the  Village 7 (134). PG Language. Most actors have movies like this soggy drama on their resume but Corbin Bleu should have chosen a bit more wisely since its his first major movie beyond the ""High School Musical"" universe. Still he handles himself well as Cale a teen who dreams of becoming a motocross pro. Naturally hell face every obstacle imaginable before we get to the all-important finals. Though the film deserves credit for its depiction of economic hardship almost everything else is handled clumsily. And why would a movie about motocross spend so little time on the track? Bleu remains one to watch but only real fans will want to watch this.E.W.St. Trinians3 starsAn unruly girls boarding school faces foreclosure. At area theaters (137). PG-13 Drugs and alcohol sexuality language. Anyone with a fondness for the midcentury cartoons and films that inspired this scrappy comedy will appreciate the latest trip to the titular British boarding school.Rupert Everett plays headmistress Camilla Fritton whose anarchic school faces bankruptcy. Her students immediately offer to help as long as lawbreaking is allowed. Though these girls are saints compared with their 50s counterparts some parents may be uncomfortable with the mayhem that ensues. They themselves however might appreciate campy appearances from Everett Russell Brand and especially Colin Firth as the fool who falls for Miss Fritton. E.W.

Starring Katie Featherston Micah Sloat and Michael Bayouth. Directed by Oren Peli. (R. 99 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Its possible to reach a point where low budget becomes a filmmaking advantage. When you have no serious special effects no time for reshoots and your two lead actors have one feature film role between them the story has to be really good. ""Paranormal Activity"" goes down in the ultra-low-budget horror movie hall of fame recalling the vibe of ""The Blair Witch Project"" without copying that movie outright. Its an acquired taste - people who prefer minor league baseball games and amateur porn are more likely to enjoy this movie - but succeeds in its modest goals of building tension slowly and generating a handful of legitimate scares. A few people in the audience were laughing during the first half of the film. No one was laughing during the long walk out of the theater. You may already know the story behind the film. Director Oren Peli shot it in seven days entirely in his home for 15000. It was championed by Steven Spielberg among others and a more polished version of the movie was ordered. But when Peli screened the original crowds enjoyed it so much that the real thing got the distribution deal. Hopefully you know almost nothing about the plot which will not be revealed here. Katie and Micah (Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat) are a young couple who are experiencing some paranormal weirdness in their small condo. Micah sets up a camera to capture the events and the audience goes along for the ride. You may not be rushing to rent Featherston and Sloats other work (and work is singular - only Featherston had been in a movie before) but the actors have excellent chemistry and both are sexy in a real-people-you-know non-Hollywood kind of way. Sloat is particularly convincing with a clueless bravado that brings some needed levity to the slower parts of the film. Peli does some wonderful things with sound which hopefully wont get ruined by jackasses in your audience who are conversing at inappropriate times. His script is strong and less ambiguous than ""Blair Witch."" (One wonders what he could do with say 45000.) The slow parts are a little too slow and the special effects arent very special. But he paces the movie perfectly with a less-is-more mentality that comes when your film isnt quite as expensive as a Honda Civic. In the end the budget seems about perfect. It turns out that a really cheap film and a filmgoer with a good imagination is more than enough for a scary and entertaining night at the movies. -- Advisory This film contains strong language frightening scenes gore and some (offscreen) amateur porn.

ABOUT THE MOVIEParanormal Activity    (out of four) Stars Katie Featherston Micah Sloat Mark Fredrichs Amber Armstrong Ashley Palmer Director Oren Peli Distributor Paramount Pictures Rating R for language Running time 1 hour 27 minutes Expands Friday in select cities By Claudia Puig USA TODAY No-frills chills are what Paranormal Activity offers in unrelenting supply. This unsettling ultra-low-budget tale capitalizes on our innate fear of things that go bump in the night and adds a supernatural element that will effectively terrorize even the toughest among us. Think The Blair Witch Project meets The Exorcist and then dial it up a few notches and you have an approximation of the subtle but terrifying atmosphere of Paranormal Activity. A straightforward faux-documentary style and unfamiliar but believable actors infuse the film with a fear factor that is all the more powerful. A young couple living in a seemingly ordinary San Diego house are beset by inexplicable incidents usually at night. Lights switch on by themselves; thudding and scuttling noises wake them in the wee hours. Micah (Micah Sloat) a day trader with a sarcastic streak is bent on catching on film whatever is haunting them using a camera he leaves on at all hours. His girlfriend Katie (Katie Featherston) studying to be a teacher is uneasy about documenting whatever is menacing them. The two have a credible chemistry which adds to the plausibility of the tale. Katie grows more upset when Micah issues challenges to the force terrorizing them and tries to communicate via Ouija board. Is this some deranged intruder a ghost seeking to make contact or a demonic presence? Because the film takes place entirely inside a suburban tract house the sense of terror is heightened. That they remain in the house throughout the ordeal intensifies the claustrophobia and the potential for horror. Israeli writer/director Oren Peli made the film in seven days in 2006 at his own home and on a shoestring budget of 15000. His naturalistic sometimes even clinical style works terrifically and terrifyingly in this context though things become repetitive as the action progresses. Whatever is bedeviling Micah and Katie engages in surprisingly low-tech but eerie antics. This movie proves it doesnt take elaborate special effects to strike panic in our hearts. Its shocking how chilling a rippling sheet can be or how ominous the sudden shutting of a bedroom door. Paranormal Activity seizes upon the fear of the unknown and worms its way under our skin like a creepy parasite.

Micah and Katie live in a sunny suburban subdivision that is anything but eerie. Yet theyre hearing unexplained thumps in the night. Car keys left on the kitchen counter are found on the floor. Micah a tech guy sees this as an opportunity to buy a big honkin video camera and record the midnight creepshow. Katie having experienced this kind of thing before calls in a parapsychologist. ""Not a ghost. Most likely a demon"" the expert says. Micah smirks. Over the course of the next 90 minutes Micahs dudeish know-it-all attitude is going to create a real ordeal for himself Katie and any viewers of a nervous disposition. If there is a spectral presence stalking your home ""Is that all you got?"" is not a recommended greeting. As we see their malevolent visitor has got a whole whole lot more. Without financing stars or more than a couple of special effects first-time writer/director Olen Peli has made a diabolically effective essay in irrational horror. The fact that the setting is a prefab box on a typical street inhabited by two ordinary people defuses the sales resistance that comes with cobwebs castles and carpets of blue-lit dry ice fog. In this bland domestic environment occult occurrences are doubly freaky. The documentary-style photography is all through the lens of Micahs camera sometimes mounted on a tripod in the sleeping couples bedroom sometimes handheld and jiggly. As the days and nights pass the couple become mortally terrified of the shadowy creature that is sharing their quarters. So do we. Pelis tiny budget reportedly 15000 was his biggest blessing. He had no money to make a monster but he understands that the idea of the monster is what generates fear. With a few groaning floorboards some shadows and an inspired use of video camera time code Peli brews a potent virus of paranoia relieved by solid laughs and deepened by real pathos. And the audience descends from uneasiness to nervous giggles to yelping alarm. The interplay among the four cast members is exemplary. Katies girlfriend drops by to confirm what a dork Micah is and an experienced psychic makes a couple of house calls to dispense unhelpful fatalistic advice. But actors Micah Sloat and Katie Featherstone carry the film on their capable shoulders. Micah aggravates Katie with his incessant filming. Hes peeved by her concealing some worrisome aspects of her childhood. They both bend the truth and use people yet theyre relatable. Theyre going through an emotional wringer as the spirit grows ever more aggressive but theyre committed to weathering this crisis together. PARANORMAL ACTIVITY  out of 4 stars Rating R for language. Theaters Rosedale Southdale. Thankfully the origin and motives of their nemesis remain murky. All scary stories tap into one basic emotion dread of the unknown. Imposing a glib tidy rationale on the thing would cheapen the mystery. There is no need to define it because we remember it from the nights when it used to lurk in the dark beneath our beds.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The new cinema verite horror film/mockumentary Paranormal Activity paradoxically feels more like a sequel to The Blair Witch Project than that films actual sequel. Like an ideal follow-up Paranormal Activity takes the same basic premise--amateur filmmaker documents own descent into paranoia and terror at the hands of sinister unseen forces--in a bold new direction. Where Project got a lot of mileage out of the archetypal campfire-story spookiness of the wilderness where its hapless filmmakers got lost Paranormal Activity derives much of its power from juxtaposing supernatural otherworldliness with the mundanity of the apartment where its action takes place. At best Paranormal Activity makes the banal and commonplace deeply unsettling. The films resemblance to Blair Witch extends to unknown lead actors who are realistic and convincing enough to come off as shrill and unpleasant. After all people are seldom at their best when confronted by dark powers beyond their comprehension. Micah Sloat stars as a goofball technology-happy day trader who picks up a video camera to document a series of ghostly disturbances that have plagued his college-student girlfriend (Katie Featherstone) from an early age. Sloat enters into the project in a spirit of boyish adventure; he wants to capture the whole creepy rollercoaster ride for posterity. Featherstone sees nothing fun about the hell shes experiencing. The cracks in the couples relationship rise to the surface as incidents of unexplainable seemingly supernatural phenomena begin occurring with increasing frequency. Without its firm grounding in the ho-hum day-to-day reality of a reasonably well-adjusted twentysomething couple that can handle most of what life has to offer Paranormal Activity could easily have been nothing more than a tardy Blair Witch knockoff with second-generation J-horror flourishes. A regrettable Ouija-board sequence alone threatens to stop the film cold and hurl it into the annals of camp but the filmmakers weather occasional missteps while cultivating a tone of creeping dread. The film loses some of its grimy verisimilitude toward the end but its nevertheless a surprisingly effective low-budget shocker with a sensibility as current as the latest viral videos yet rooted in the suggestive less-is-more atmospherics of Val Lewton.

The compelling documentary Believe condenses the comedians fascinating life into 105 minutes of interviews archive material and -- most importantly to understanding any performer -- several decades of performance footage. Believe which was directed by Izzards ex-girlfriend Sarah Townsend suffers from the problem inherent in most Hollywood biopics Smashing a mans life into a series of ""very important moments"" creates a schizophrenic tone. Townsend also abbreviates several of Izzards early street and standup performances taking away key elements from her storys arc -- the development of Izzards onstage persona. Regardless Believe contains a good deal of footage thrilling to anyone excited by the backstage and onstage workings of live performance. Izzard also gives several genuinely poignant interviews saving the best -- a reflection on how the loss of his mother influenced his desire to be a comic -- for a strong emotional kick to punctuate the proceedings. The best moment however is the legendary performance in which Izzard appears for the first time in his trademark dress and pantyhose. This magnificent scene and others like it prove that as with comedy itself sometimes great material is enough to overcome merely average presentation. (Sunset 5) (John Wheeler) A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - BLISS If you missed Junes The Stoning of Soraya M. heres another chance to be reminded of murderous misogyny in another Muslim community -- this time in Turkey. Based on a 2002 best-selling novel by Zulfu Livaneli Bliss creakily illustrates the clash between ancient abhorrent custom and modernity. Found unconscious by the side of the road in her village 17-year-old Meryem (Ozgu Namal) is held responsible for her own rape; a distant cousin Cemal (Murat Han) is summoned to take her to Istanbul to perform the ""honor killing"" for having shamed her family. The conflicted brute cant bring himself to murder Meryem and soon the two join Irfan (Talat Bulut) a sociology prof they meet while working at a fish farm on his yacht in the Aegean (filmed quite prettily by Mirsad Herovic) so that enlightenment can be taught as characters calcify into constructs. Though calling out the abominable oppression of women even in a vehicle as didactic as Bliss serves at least some redeemable purpose that mission is more than a little compromised when its suggested that Meryem could find happiness with Cemal -- the man who after he decides not to kill her settles on verbally and physically abusing her. (Music Hall) (Melissa Anderson)COUPLES RETREAT Couples retreat. In the latest from Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau (co-starring and co-writing) we learn that one compelling reason to make a life commitment is so you will always have someone to eat with at Applebees. The movies cumulative idea is that forgetting the delusions of midlife panic this is all there is youre already living the best possible life -- a message of sedentary wisdom betrayed when the actual film is as undeniably dreary as a plate of gummy Chicken Parmesan Tanglers. Vaughn Favreau (flagrantly shirtless) Jason Bateman and Faizon Love are four buddies just ""regular guys"" -- meaning as always puffy dull-minded lunks with Vaughn increasingly being Jim Belushis heir apparent. They take their respective significant others on a group vacation to an island paradise along with maybe 12 pages of sit-comic script outline to be riffed out into feature length. Arriving at the Eden Resort our beer-commercial heroes are menaced by enforced couples therapy and the resorts staff of Speedo-wearing homo-macho Euro-Hispanic Others (Jean Reno Carlos Ponce) who put them through yoga humpings and realityTV-type challenges intended to renew the spark missing from their relationships. The presence of Bateman begs comparison with the funnier-while-thematically-similar Extract though Retreat also recalls Voyage in Italy if Rossellini were to replace intimate human insight with lowest-common-denominator doody-boner-bare butt-jackoff haw-haws. (Citywide) (Nick Pinkerton)GO  THE DAMNED UNITED We call it soccer but for the Brits its football and its damn serious business. From 1968 to 1974 Brian Clough (Michael Sheen) a manager/coach from the tiny town of Derby and his assistant manager Peter Taylor (Timothy Spall) turned a third-rate club into division champs. That success wasnt nearly as sweet as getting to take over Leeds United a top-tier team previously managed by Cloughs archenemy Don Revie (Colm Meaney). In this terrific film screenwriter Peter Morgan (The Queen Frost/Nixon) and television director Tom Hooper (John Adams) making his feature debut use a series of elegantly staged flashbacks to trace Clough and Taylors rapid rise to fame and the hubris that led the former to stumble badly when he got to Leeds while also wounding his lifelong friendship with Taylor. A movie about soccer that doesnt spend a lot of time on the field The Damned United like everything Morgan writes is an intimate character study one that is enriched by a stellar ensemble of British pros including Jim Broadbent as Derbys team owner. These actors are good at what they do -- like those soccer players who dodge and weave with effortless grace.

Sep. 13 600pm GOOD HAIR Don Imuss hateful racist 2007 remarks about ""nappy-headed hos"" underscored the immense fear of and fascination with the hair follicles of African-American women. Chris Rock the host co-writer and co-producer of first-time director Jeff Stilsons Good Hair never mentions Imus outburst; his interest in the political social and sexual entanglements of the tonsorial stem from the more personal -- specifically when one of his two young daughters plaintively asked ""Daddy how come I dont have good hair?"" Rock affable as ever queries a few black actresses (Nia Long providing the most candid responses ""Weave sex is a little awkward""); visits beauty salons; oversees an experiment by a scientist who demonstrates the corrosive effects of sodium hydroxide the main ingredient in hair relaxer; travels to Chennai India where women sacrifice hair that ends up in weaves costing thousands of dollars in the U.S.; and stares in disbelief at the Paris Is Burning-like competition at the annual Bronner Bros.-sponsored ""Hair Battle"" in Atlanta. Rock is certainly a sympathetic and curious observer though including Ice-Ts remark that ""a real pimp can tell what a woman looks like baldheaded"" betrays some of the gender politics that remain vigorously unexamined in this breezy superficial doc. (Citywide) (Melissa Anderson)THE HORSE BOY Theres a moment in the documentary The Horse Boy when the father of its subject an autistic child named Rowan explains his sons intrinsic understanding of nature by showing how he has organized his animal toys by species. The dad marvels that Rowan has grouped biologically close rhinos and pigs in the same box -- while ignoring the ostrich figurine thats also in there. This selective filtering of information is typical of the film a quest toward an inevitable inspirational destination continuing the recent trend of using precious theater space as dumping grounds for a-cinematic PBS also-rans. Mom and Dad take 6-year-old Rowan whose jagged tantrums are best relaxed by contact with horses on a riding tour of Outer Mongolia to consult tribal shamans in the hope of untangling his mental blocks. Its fun to imagine how The Horse Boys intended audience the nontraditional-therapy crowd would react to the same film if the parents took Rowan to exorcists in papal Rome -- just imagine a priest bringing up ""haunted wombs"" -- but the Third World Otherness does wonders. The Horse Boy may excuse itself as a ""raising awareness"" tract on autism but the exotic travelogue isnt a practicable care option for most cases and it certainly isnt worthy cinema. (Nuart) (Nick Pinkerton)GO  MR. RIGHT For Londoner Louise (Georgia Zaris) the man of her dreams (Jeremy Edwards) turns gay when she least expects it which may actually be Louises fault -- all her friends are gay men and as the makers of this well-crafted romantic comedy slyly suggest gay may indeed be contagious. Co-directed by the sister-and-brother team of Jacqui and David Morris (he wrote the script and plays a small role) Mr. Right smoothly tracks the romantic lives of Louises friends which include her BFF Alex (Luke de Woolfson) whose relationship with a TV producer (James Lance) is derailed by a hunky hustler (Benjamin Hart) who in turn has grown weary of his own sugar daddy (Morris). Theres also a single-parent art dealer (Rocky Marshall) whos afraid to introduce his new boyfriend (Leon Ockenden) into his daughters life. If that sounds like a lot of characters to keep up with it is for a while but one gradually sorts out who goes with whom. When nearly all the couples break up at a midfilm dinner party the Morrises and their likable grounded cast manage to steer clear of silliness and shrill melodrama. In a refreshingly adult manner love eventually finds its way back to almost everyone though poor Louise might do well to just throw up her hands and go lesbian. (Sunset 5) (Chuck Wilson)GO  PARANORMAL ACTIVITY For Katie (Katie Featherston) a San Diego college student things have been going bump in the night since she was 8 years old and a ghost attached itself to her. The unseen being that has been benignly haunting her for years thrills Katies loving but skeptical boyfriend Micah (Micah Sloat) who sets up a video camera to capture any supernatural goings-on. For his debut feature reportedly shot in seven days at a cost of 15 grand writer-director Oren Peli works wonders with stationary camera footage of the sleeping couple The bedroom door moves slightly; lights in the hallway go on and off; a shadow passes the bed. As the nights pass the presence seemingly annoyed at being recorded begins upping the ante and soon it appears that poor Katie is on the verge of channeling her inner Linda Blair. Grounded by strong performances by newcomers Featherston and Sloat who pretty much have the movie to themselves Paranormal Activity which demands to be seen in a crowded theater is refreshingly blood-free -- the fact that its old-school scares caused seemingly jaded 20-somethings at a recent midnight screening to squirm in their seats suggests that theres hope for the world after all. (ArcLight Hollywood) (Chuck Wilson) PETER AND VANDY Middlebrow Sundance product is the scourge of American independent cinema today -- those innocuously ""arty"" totally commercial and barely-left-of-mainstream films that trick the masses into feeling smarter and edgier than deserved (see Little Miss Sunshine Juno and dozens of titles aiming to be both). Jay DiPietros modest directorial debut Peter and Vandy is at least impassioned but if the film hadnt been adapted from his 2002 play about a strained romance chronicled out of temporal sequence wed dismiss it as a cut-rate (500) Days of Summer -- itself a cut-rate example of the aforementioned fest genre. Temperamental and passive-aggressively inarticulate downtown NYC 20-somethings Peter (Jason Ritter) and Vandy (Jess Weixler) confess their love cruelly project their insecurities during inane fights over how to make a PBamp;J sandwich meet for the first time and on and on through the back-and-forth span of their relationship. Ritter and Weixler do share an easy-at-being-uneasy chemistry mostly because his performance is downright distinguished compared to her blandness but DiPietros screenplay is emotionally myopic. His sharpest written exchanges -- and there arent many -- are buried under his inexplicable need to embrace the nonlinear conceit. Did we mention theres indie rock?

"Paranormal Activity Somewhere Hitchcock is smiling - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Paranormal ActivityParanormal Activity Somewhere Hitchcock is smilingWriter-director Oren Peli delivers a simple but gut-churning ghost story thatll make you keep your lights on.October 03 2009|BETSY SHARKEY | FILM CRITIC Just for the record the time to tell your significant other that an evil force has been stalking you since you were 8 is long before youre engaged and have moved in together.Im not suggesting the whole demon/ghost/unidentified whatever is a deal breaker but it should at least get a mention.Consider the case of Katie (Katie Featherston) and Micah (Micah Sloat) the young couple at the terrifying center of ""Paranormal Activity."" By the time Katie tells Micah about her ""problem"" and by the time Micah takes it seriously that ""thing that goes bump in the night"" has really built up a head of steam.Before the lights go back up -- and at some point you may wonder whether they ever will -- there will be a very tight coil of anxiety buried deep in your gut that is very hard to get rid of.The man to curse for all this darkness is Israeli-born writer-director Oren Peli a video-game designer turned filmmaker who has created a psychological thriller of such small scale and yet such heightened effect that no doubt Hitchcock wherever he may be is smiling. That the film was shot over just a few days in the directors house with no money no stars and no studio involved until much much later is a testament to Pelis natural instincts. Though the story does not have either the sophistication or the complexity of the master the first-time director understands that its what you dont see and the way in which you dont see it that counts.The film is set in the comfortable affluence of a San Diego suburb where bad things arent supposed to happen. Were dropped into Katie and Micahs lives just as Micah is setting up a DIY surveillance system so that he can record any suspicious activity in the house.As he begins shooting footage and talking to Katie we realize that hes merely going to elaborate lengths to prove that she is just imagining things.Night after night the time-lapse camera keeps its unblinking eye on their bedroom where most of the action takes place. That footage along with the free-style video that Micah shoots himself is our primary point of view on this story which works to add a certain veracity in a YouTube/Facebook way. Though the footage looks real enough you can also sense a bona-fide filmmakers hand in the proceedings.Theres not much to the story Evil has its eye on Katie the couple tries to escape or outwit it and we know historically how that tends to go. There is lots of scary stuff in between and in this case very little comic relief beyond the psychic/ghost-buster who makes house calls.Featherston and Sloat do a good job as the couple in the middle of the mess as they swing between bickering about the thing and being frightened by it.Now about that scary stuff. We humans must come with a genetic marker clearly labeled ""fear of the unknown."" How else to explain why your breathing stops stomach clenches and you suddenly develop bat ears in the face of the mundane -- a light goes off a door closes. The trick of course comes in not being able to explain the who what and why of it.Peli works at mining the unknown the unknowable like a minimalist using small moments and virtually no special effects exceedingly well. As so often is the case in the horror genre the world hes created for Katie and Micah is a closed one -- if they leave the house we dont see it; friends and relatives dont drop by.Like ""The Blair Witch Project"" another faux documentary-style horror movie ""Paranormal Activity"" has been building buzz on the Internet where according to crazed publicity dispatches from the studio that Im pretty sure are part of a guerrilla-style marketing campaign fans ""demanded"" that it be put in theaters immediately. (I didnt realize you could do that because Ive been wanting to see ""My Friend Flicka"" on the big screen forever.)You can understand why studios would be keen to make these fans happy since ""Blair Witch"" cost roughly 60000 and went on to make 248.6 million worldwide. Compared with ""Blair Witch"" ""Paranormal"" was made on the cheap with a budget of around 15000. With midnight screenings selling out even with marketing costs this film will soon be wallowing in gravy.Meanwhile Pelis at work on a new thriller ""Area 51"" this time with a real budget and Hollywood muscle behind him. You just hope he doesnt lose his scary along the way.--betsy.sharkeylatimes.com--Paranormal ActivityMPAA rating R for languageRunning time 1 hour 26 minutesPlaying In limited release locally at ArcLight Hollywood midnight screenings only MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESBruce Greenwood heeds other-worldly callMarch 6 2012Paranormal Activity 3 has a scary-good love affair with...October 20 2011Black List showcases the best overlooked screenplaysDecember 13 2010A spine-tingling ending for Paranormal ActivityOctober 26 2009MORE STORIES ABOUTParanormal ActivityLightsOren PeliCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-paranormal3-2009oct03,0,7435653.story",200,paranormalactivity20,paranormalactivity,latimes

Katie (Katie Featherston) and boyfriend Micah (Micah Sloat) are freaked out by noises in their San Diego home. To catch whats out there he sets up a night-vision video camera while they sleep.

Movies by Owen Gleiberman Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Posted October 23 2009 -- 1200 AM EDT Exactly 10 years ago The Blair Witch Project divided audiences every bit as much as it unsettled them. So when I say that Oren Pelis Paranormal Activity a haunted-house thriller shot for 11000 was made very much in the peekaboo-verite spirit of Blair Witch -- and that in fact it may be an even scarier film -- you could find that frightening in one of two ways. You might say ""Cool Ive got to ? see that"" or you may think ""No I wont get fooled again"" What I can tell the Blair Witch skeptics is that in that movie you never really did get to see very much but in Paranormal Activity you do you honestly do -- though in a slow-build way thats freaky and terrifying. The entire film takes place in the two-story San Diego home of sweet but spiky Katie ? (Katie Featherston) who claims to be plagued by demons and Micah (Micah Sloat) her obnoxious boyfriend who totes around a video camera to record evidence that those spirits are real. The two joke and bicker but at night we see them asleep the camera at a fixed angle in their dankly lit bedroom. The shot keeps skipping ahead hour by time-coded hour until stuff starts to...spook. With ? its this-is-really-happening vibe Paranormal Activity scrapes away 30 years of encrusted nightmare cliches. The fear is real all right because the fear is really in you.

Thompson Screamfest 2007 Wednesday October 10 2007 at 6 p.m. By Luke Y. Thompson In its sixth year Screamfest continues to make itself a must for any L.A.-area horror fan with a mixture of hot new releases (30 Days of Night three days early George Romeros new Diary of the Dead) big-screen showings of anticipated DVD titles (the extended cut of Robert Rodriguezs Planet Terror Joel Silvers House on Haunted Hill 2) special events (Friday the 13th Part 3 in the original 3-D) and some of the best new upstart fright flicks out there. In 2006 the fest brought us Hatchet The Lost and Behind the Mask The Rise of Leslie Vernon; this years lineup is bigger on creeps than chuckles and if you like this stuff as much as I do may well deliver some of your favorite filmgoing experiences of 2007. Best in the fest is Oren Pelis Paranormal Activity a descendant of both The Haunting and The Blair Witch Project that purports to be found footage from a young couple hoping to document the things that go bump in their nights. Making the most out of a single location and tiny cast its the scariest movie of the year. Equally compelling is The Signal in which exposure to an odd broadcast on cable TV results in varying degrees of madness; that the film has three directors adds to the intentionally disorienting effect. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Very bad people are the antagonists in Andrew Moormans taut motel-room thriller Sympathy Jamie Blanks pretty and unpleasant young-couple-versus-roughneck-drug-dealers tale Storm Warning and Mark Youngs listless post-apocalyptic cannibal battle Tooth amp; Nail; argue among yourselves if these are technically ""horror"" or not. Just be sure to skip the uninspired Children of the Corn knockoff Hallowed Ground and the initially interesting but ultimately tedious Halloween-with-a-twist wannabe Frayed. If dumb fun and familiarity are your thing theres a better option Days of Darkness which begins as a Romero zombie riff then mutates into a lower-budget take on Carpenters The Thing with a lovingly absurd final twist.And if youve ever doubted those Landmark Theatres ads that proclaim ""the language of film is universal"" dont miss Room 205 a Danish riff on the J-horror ""pissed-off dead girl"" subgenre; Doodeind a Dutch movie set in Scotland that involves a haunted house and some really cool visuals reminiscent of ""survival horror"" video games; and Hells Ground a slasher movie from Pakistan in which a bunch of stoner kids in a van on their way to a concert run afoul of a crazed Islamic fundamentalist in a burka (If thats too un-P.C. for your liking theres also an encore screening of Screamfest 2006s The Tripper in which a bunch of American stoner kids in a van on their way to a concert are terrorized by a Ronald Reagan impersonator wielding an ax.) The world is so full of real horror these days that its heartening to think that a shared love of fictional scares can bring us together. (Mann Chinese; thru Sun.

"Paranormal Activity | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; paranormal-activity ) Paranormal Activity (United States 2009) October 09 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli The familiar looks different at night. Incandescent lights dont quite chase away the shadows with the effectiveness of the sun. The rooms and hallways of a home so comforting at noon can become cloaked with unease past the witching hour. This fear of the dark one of humankinds most common phobias lies at the heart of Paranormal Activity as a seemingly normal house is turned into a nest of terror once the daylight has faded. Things that go bump in the night can instantly transform the most mundane location into a place of menace. This is a tale of the supernatural but its strength is that it is rooted in the ordinary. Thats what makes it creepy. In a sense this is The Blair Witch Project redux. It replaces the ""lost in the woods"" premise of the surprise 1999 hit with a ""trapped in a house"" concept. Both movies were made on shoestring budgets pretend to be constructed from ""lost"" documentary footage use the camera to develop a first-person narrative and - most importantly - rely on the viewers imagination to build upon the horror that is only hinted at on screen. The Blair Witch Project is atmosphere incarnate and a similar claim can be made about Paranormal Activity. Both movies build momentum by playing upon the expectation that something ominous is going to happen. Since our perspective is constrained by what the camera can see we are not privy to anything that happens beyond its field of view although we can often hear sounds. Paranormal Activitys approach is simple but undeniably effective. Still those who demand blood gore and violence from horror films may be bored by what this one offers. Its a largely cerebral experience and it could face the kind of backlash that overwhelmed The Blair Witch Project when it exited its phenomenally successful art house run and opened wide into multiplexes. What was embraced by audiences appreciative of the unconventional was rejected by those weaned on mainstream horror. Only time will tell whether Paranormal Activitys tighter pacing and different setting will allow it to escape a similar fate. The premise is simple Katie (Katie Featherstone) and Micah (Micah Sloat) two twenty-somethings who have moved in together are beginning to suffer symptoms of ""a haunting"" in their new San Diego house. For Katie this is nothing new - she has experienced being watched and followed at different times during her life. For Micah however this is exciting stuff. He buys a video camera and sets it on a tripod near their bed to record the room while they sleep at night and getting everything on film (actually computer) becomes paramount trumping even the consideration of pacifying his freaked out girlfriend. The camera does its job with the microphone capturing strange sounds and the viewfinder reflecting disquieting images like a door opening and closing of its own volition. As Micah becomes more energized by the situation Katies terror escalates. She consults a psychic who provides two startling pieces of information the spirit haunting Katie is a demon (not a ghost) and she is the specific target of the supernatural interference - leaving the house will not lessen her plight. And every night things get worse. The pillars upon which Paranormal Activity are founded are verisimilitude and simplicity. The movie doesnt try to do too much. It doesnt rely on special effects. Its basically one set (a house) one camera carefully placed lights and two actors who are entirely convincing playing these characters. Theres not a lot more to the movie than that. Many of the daytime conversations between Katie and Micah are either extemporized or made to seem that way. Director Oren Peli has crafted the movie with such deceptive simplicity that it almost seems like anyone could do it. And that in a way is its genius. It helps us to relate. It helps us to buy into the ghost story in a way that we might not if the production was more lavishly mounted. I dont believe in ghosts but this is not a movie I would want to watch at home by myself past midnight. Suddenly the natural settling noises of the house would sound anything but natural. Is the movie scary? For a horror movie that is often the bottom line. While it may be a stretch to call any motion picture conventionally ""frightening"" Paranormal Activity is suffused with a creepy disturbing atmosphere that envelops the viewer. The ""boo"" moments are effectively constructed to generate the necessary jolt without seeming unnecessarily manipulative. The ending which was apparently selected over Pelis original version after being suggested by Steven Spielberg is appropriate for the story. In some ways the marketing campaign for Paranormal Activity threatens to dwarf the movie. Paramount is building interest on the strong word-of-mouth generated by targeted screenings and by the exclusivity factor of slowly rolling it out to select theaters in specific markets. Those who feel ""left out"" in the early stages of the phased distribution can ""demand"" the movie on a website. Paramount promises that once 1000000 demands are recorded the movie will go wide. (This is a bit of sham since plans to distribute prints to multiplexes around the country were finalized weeks ago but the website provides viewers with the illusion of participation.) The Halloween season is the perfect time of the year for a production such as this. Every October were all looking for a good scare. In an era when mainstream horror is often indistinguishable from self-parody it takes something basic like this to be diabolically successful. (Spoiler note for the trailer If you really want to be surprised by the movie avoid the trailer. Take my word for it.)

They find that as on reality TV shows bad behavior tends to worsen when you train a camera on it. Orin Pelis crew-less debut feature is one of the best genre spins on the pseudo-nonfiction 1st-person-cam since ""The Blair Witch Project"" with which it shares improvised performances no explicit violence or ""solution"" and a gradual escalation of chills. Horror fans who value credible creepiness over the usual splatdom will welcome this in suitable fest slots and niche DVD release. Young well-off San Diego duo Katie (Katie Featherson) and Micah (Micah Sloat) have lately been experiencing inexplicable thumps in the night. Actually shes suffered occasional spookery since childhood-it (or It) seems to follow her around. A psychic specializing in ghosts tells them he can""t help; they need a demonologist. But initially skeptical Micah decides hell ""take care of it"" himself setting up a nocturnal bedroom surveillance camera (the scariest scenes) bringing a Ouija board home etc. These are very bad ideas. While leads bickering grows tiresome ""Paranormal"" succeeds in staying unnervingly ""real"" even once nifty modest FX render the invisible visible.
