Comments Love amp; Basketball Rated PG-13  124 minutes  2013 A girl who wants to play professional basketball is in love with the boy next door who also wants to play professional basketball. When they grow up her career seems as important as his--until this idea is put to the test. Told largely from the point of view of the woman this career-versus-love story (2000) still develops the perspective of the man persuasively as Sanaa Lathan and Omar Epps reveal their characters motives with nuances of expression that transcend the dialogue. The lush emotional scenes are enhanced by the sound track--especially when the characters can hear it too. Written and directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood; with Alfre Woodard Dennis Haysbert and Debbi Morgan.

Debuting filmmaker Gina Prince-Bythewood shows an admirable command of the technical aspects of filmmaking in ""Love and Basketball"" a slick romantic drama about two L.A. athletes. Aiming to please at all costs Prince-Bythewoods narrative is too neat and its fairy-tale resolution too pat. But the pic is so well directed and lead performance by Sanaa Lathan so charismatic that audiences will overlook the scripts flaws and root for the central duo. With the right handling and marketing this New Line film scheduled for April 21 release could become a hot date movie embraced by upscale black viewers with some crossover appeal among young white urbanites and possibly reaching the B.O. of such recent black efforts as ""The Best Man"" and ""Soul Food."" Spike Lee proves himself a major force in the new African-American cinema helping to expand its range beyond inner-city and crime dramas. Last year he was instrumental in setting up his nephew Malcolm Lees romantic comedy ""The Best Man"" at Universal and here functions as producer (with partner Sam Kitt). Prince-Bythewoods romantic drama centers on the friendship rivalry and love between two youngsters from Baldwin Hills an affluent black neighborhood of Los Angeles who share an unquenchable passion for basketball. Spanning close to two decades yarn is divided into four segments or quarters as theyre called here. The first set in 1981 begins with Monica and Quincy as children when Monicas family moves in next door to Quincys. Shocked that Monica can play ball better than the boys Quincy asks her to be his girl and the two engage in a ceremonial kiss. But the bond lasts only a minute because Monica is quickly outraged by Quincys macho attitude. The second quarter set in 1988 finds the couple in high school. Quincy (Omar Epps) is following in the footsteps of his famous father Zeke McCall (Dennis Haysbert) an NBA player. Monica (Lathan) must face an arrogant Quincy who has his pick of colleges -- and attractive women. The two are clearly attracted to each other and tension builds to a highly erotic sex scene. Its in this segment that scripter begins to develop her chief theme Monicas struggle to become a bright independent woman deviating from the subservient role of housewife played by her mother (a splendid Alfre Woodard) and refusing to conform to the characteristics of the ladylike type despite the efforts of her sister and even her coach. Main dramatic conflicts occur in the third and best quarter which depicts how Monica and Quincy pursue their respective basketball careers as college sweethearts. Quincy upset by the suffering of his mother (Debbie Morgan) is forced to realize that his adulterous dad is not exactly an idol. Quincy is also let down by Monica who cant join him due to a curfew before a big game. Determined to drop out of school and turn pro Quincy breaks off their romance. Cut to Barcelona 1993 where Monica is immersed in her career. But professional fulfillment comes with the price of isolation and loneliness; she begins to doubt whether ""being all about ball"" is worth losing the love of her life and cant fully enjoy her success. Missing family and friends Monica returns home only to find Quincy engaged to be married in two weeks. At this point narrative follows the path of a screwball comedy giving a new twist to the convention of preventing a lover from marrying the wrong spouse. Unlike Hollywood chestnuts here a sexually aggressive woman pursues her man attempting to open his eyes before its too late. The storytelling is not always exciting but a more serious problem is that yarn is not deep enough in showing the meaning of basketball for Monica; one never gets the feeling that playing ball is a necessity in her life. In its insistence on gratifying the audience with an elegant movie at all costs narrative resolves its strands all too tidily including intergenerational tensions between Quincy and his father Monica and her mother and Monica and her coach. ""Love and Basketball"" is the kind of Cinderella story in which the heroine gets it all a movie whose commercial considerations must have dictated the yarns shape. That said theres no doubt that Prince-Bythewood is a gifted director The film is so suave graceful and technically accomplished that its hard to believe its a first-effort feature. Impressive production values from lensing to costumes to musical score all contribute to a glossy package. Helmer is extremely deft with her cast coaxing appealing performances from leads Epps and especially Lathan who could likely parlay her good looks and acting skill into a major Hollywood career. Supporting cast is equally adept; pic boasts standout character perfs from Woodard and Morgan as the two loving traditional mothers and Haysbert as the philandering hubby. Effortlessly erotic in a way that few films are ""Love and Basketball"" features a number of exciting sex scenes that may make it a hot date movie.

(New Line) ""Love and Basketball"" has moments of such tenderness and sophistication complimented by such romantic dreaminess between lead performers Omar Epps and Sanaa Lathan its easy to forgive the movies slower sections. First-time filmmaker Gina Prince-Bythewoods movie joins such films as ""The Best Man"" and ""The Wood"" which look for the class not the crass in African American life. When 11-year-old Monica Wright (Kyla Pratt) moves next door to Quincy McCall (Glenndon Chatman) in an affluent black neighborhood in Los Angeles its the beginning of a lifelong one-on-one tussle. Shes a tomboy absolutely crazy about basketball. When Quincy challenges her to a game on the court she shows her stuff. Shes good. Too good. So Quincy does what any self-respecting boy would He knocks her across the concrete. ""Love and Basketball"" is divided into four ""quarters"" like a basketball game as these two fight elbow-jab laugh with and love each other over the years. The ""game"" of their relationship takes 12 years from 1981 (when they meet as children) to 1993 when theyve seen it all including professional careers as ball players and relationships with other lovers. In the second quarter (1988) Quincy and Monica now played by Epps and Lathan are struggling to find themselves as ball players in high school. Quincys the star getting all the girls and the stadium applause. But Monicas having trouble with her no-nonsense aggression on the girls team; her sense of competition is considered too much for a female. Over the second and remaining quarters therell be longing for each other at the prom (as they dance with different partners); furtive gazing at one another across the miniature divide between their houses (these may be the only two affluent families in America that dont move); and an actual romance in college. Both characters are highly independent spirits. So its a cinch theyre going to break up. Quincy drops out of college to turn pro. Monica stays with her college team then goes professional in Barcelona. When she returns years later and runs into Quincy he has a fiancee. Producer Spike Lees stylistic fingerprints (or Prince-Bythewoods imitation thereof) are all over this movie. The humor is terrific the cinematography (by Reynaldo Villalobos) has a burnished glow and the score (by Lees favorite composer Terence Blanchard) is lush. But Prince-Bythewood is most definitely the auteur Its a treat to see a movie (in the spirit of ""Eves Bayou"") that gives so much time and attention to a strong female character. This is Monicas story as much as Quincys. All in all the romantic feeling of the movie carries us over the more leaden sections. (At times I did find myself wishing these two were ice-hockey players so wed only have three periods.) And the performers are uniformly assured including the wonderful Lathan Epps Alfre Woodard as Monicas proud stay-at-home mother and Dennis Haysbert as Quincys philandering pro-ball-playing father. As for the actors who play Quincy and Monica as children they steal the show. Pratt in particular is a devilish imp who fights for the ball as well as your heart. And Chatman is a charmer as he tells this new tomboy on the block that hes decided shes to be his girlfriend. ""I guess we oughta kiss now"" says the young Quincy. ""For how long?"" asks Monica. ""About five seconds"" declares the no-nonsense Quincy. Off they go to a quiet spot for the First Kiss. And as their lips meet we watch Quincys fingers counting 1-2-3-4-5. Scenes like that make it real easy to follow these two to the bitter end even if there is going to be some slack time. LOVE AND BASKETBALL (PG-13 118 minutes) - Contains some obscenity a little courtside scuffling and sexual situations.

(New Line) ""Love and Basketball"" is the old eternal-triangle thing with a boy a girl and a ball. She got game. He got game. They got each other too. She would be writer-director Gina Prince-Bythewoods heroine Monica Wright (played by a luminous Sanaa Lathan) who can drive to the inside or shoot from the outside. You can tell that the game is at the core of her imagination; it dominates her waking thoughts it leaps through her dreams and shes never happier than when shes on the court even though shes solidly entrenched in middle-class prosperity. The game isnt a way out for her; its a way of life even a way of being. Theres no room for anything else in her life except possibly the boy next door. Q also has game. Qs got the jumper that never misses the moves to slice through the crowd in the paint and the vertical leap to put him so far over the orange he can improvise a jazz concerto on the way down. Q--for Quincy played by Omar Epps of the soulful eyes and broad shoulders--is a top athlete with a classic pedigree His father Zeke (the magisterial Dennis Haysbert) is a longtime NBA star. The movie is in some way conceived as an epic. It follows this jump-shot-crossed relationship set in elite athletic circles for more than 10 years tracking not merely the triumphs and tragedies but also the weird chemistry of love at that level. When Q and Monica first meet in the early 80s they are kids. Her moves are almost as good as his infuriating him and he shoves her to the ground giving her a scar that will last for life. But in the antagonism is also furious respect and fascination. Its sort of like the old one about wooing a girl by ignoring her. It never works in life (I should know) but its a movie staple well burnished and useful here. By high school Qs moves have made him a hero. As with any star athlete he is buried in temptation that he only occasionally manages to resist. The girls throw themselves at him while Monica whose temper keeps her in perpetual trouble on her team is crumpled into ignored bitterness. But one of the magic plot patterns of the film mirrors the narrative magic of basketball (the game even provides the movie with its structure--each act is billed as a quarter) which is the alarming swiftness with which the situation changes. In other words just as in the real NBA no lead is safe and the final 10 seconds can seem to last a lifetime. Monicas last high school game is a big one and she gets the athletic scholarship that validates her. She also at last catches Qs eye and he sees her as a young woman not that annoying kid next door. They become a back-court pair. In college at USC hes the star shes again the scrub. But again the situation reverses itself with stunning quickness. Quincy comes unglued when his revered fathers weaknesses are revealed in a nasty divorce; his game and life and self-esteem suffer. He wants her to help him. Alas as Quincys going down Monicas going up. Overcoming her attitude problems applying herself to the rigors of team discipline harnessing at last her fury to the ends of victory and not self-expression she steps in when a senior is hurt and becomes the man. She yearns to help her troubled boyfriend but she still loves the game and cannot leave it to become his comforter. The film jumps ahead a few years; shes a star in European womens basketball hes a well-traveled ever-less-successful NBA journeyman. Yet each feels an emptiness each questions whats been given up for the game. Then an injury cripples Qs knee and he has to reassess. That becomes the concluding dilemma as each has to answer three questions What does the game mean to me and what does this other person mean? Can it work? Prince-Bythewoods also the one with game. An ex-jock herself she brings womens basketball to life taking the camera into some well-constructed game sequences so we can feel Monicas drive and grace from her point of view. The film manages to accomplish something no media hype or TV exposure has yet brought off It makes you care about womens basketball. But even more it makes you care about athletes as human beings not merely cereal box icons. Thats rare enough in movies and this one has crossover hit written all over it. LOVE AND BASKETBALL (118 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for mild sexual innuendo.

Directed and written by Gina Prince-Bythewood. 124 minutes. Several theaters. ""PG-13"" - Parental guidance advised because of sexuality and language. --------------------------- ""Love and Basketball"" certainly lives up to its name. Its about the love that two basketball players - Monica Wright (Sanaa Lathan) and Quincy McCall (Omar Epps) - have for the game and one another. And while the basketball isnt bad its the love that recommends the movie. ""Basketball"" is divided into four acts or quarters. The first is set in 1981 when the Wrights a banking couple from Atlanta move next door to the McCalls in a prosperous Los Angeles neighborhood. A childrens pick-up game is in progress and one of the new kids gets involved. But a cap is removed and - oops - turns out the new kid is a girl. Doesnt matter though because the girls got sass and moves and the two-on-two game is tight until frustrations get the better of young Quincy and he shoves her to the ground permanently scarring her cheek. Quincys father is Zeke McCall of the L.A. Clippers and theres a nice scene where Quincy tries to write an apology to the new girl Monica. He says in frustration ""I cant do this (expletive)."" Zeke - the deep-voiced actor Dennis Haysbert best-known as Pedro Cerrano in the ""Major League"" movies - scolds him. ""What did I tell you about using that word?"" he demands. The boy sighs shrugs then repeats his fathers mantra "" `Cant shouldnt be part of a mans vocabulary."" The second quarter takes us to 1988 and Crenshaw High School where Quincy and Monica are both seniors and basketball stars. Hes highly recruited and popular while everyone complains about her attitude. Ironic because Sanaa Lathan has less attitude than her 11-year-old counterpart (Kyla Pratt plays Monica in the childhood scenes). Instead she exudes a kind of sad-eyed vulnerability even when shes accusing her mother (Alfre Woodard playing a genteel Southerner) of worrying shes a lesbian. OK lets face it Romances have a predictable pattern - boy meets girl yadda yadda - so one simply hopes for a little subtlety and originality along the way and this writer-director Gina Prince delivers. One night in bed for example Quincy hears his mother and father arguing (he used to hear them making love) so he climbs out his window walks 20 feet over to Monicas house and raps on her window. With a few muttered sleepy words he climbs in and sleeps on the floor; its obvious theyve been through this before. In a quiet subtle way it reveals the depth of their friendship. Their love blossoms at USC where again hes a star while shes struggling to make the womans team. Then opportunity knocks for her just as hes devastated by a revelation about his father. For a time we get whiffs of ""A Star Is Born"" - the rising female against the falling male - but thankfully the movie doesnt go completely in that direction either. If theres a fault here its in the character of Quincy McCall whos a little generic and bland and condemns his father too greatly for his indiscretions. Obviously Gina Prince knows how to write a good female lead (a woman who acts more than is acted upon for a change) but her male characters need work. The whole ""hes got a problem with his father"" while ""shes got a problem with her mother"" is a bit too compartmentalized too with speeches and resolutions tied together too neatly. But this is a romance movie and the main questions are ""Did you believe in the love?"" and ""Did it make you feel good?"" Answers to both Yes.

Lennix Dennis Haysbert Debbi Morgan Alfre Woodard; Director Gina Prince Bythewood; Author Gina Prince Bythewood; Producer (group) 40 Acres amp; a Mule Filmworks; Release Date Wide 04/21/2000; Runtime (in minutes) 124; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor New Line Cinema Posted April 21 2000 -- 1200 AM EDT First-time feature filmmaker Gina Prince-Bythewood divides Love amp; Basketball into four quarters and like a really satisfying game the score at the end of each is no indication of who will win at the final buzzer. The love part is the bounding and rebounding relationship between Quincy and Monica next-door neighbors who tussle and spar as Los Angeles kids (first quarter) then mature into strong-willed sweethearts played with sparky chemistry by Omar Epps (""The Wood"") and Sanaa Lathan (""The Best Man""). The basketball part is the ardor each lover has for the game Quincy the son of a famous NBA player (Dennis Haysbert who plays slippery men so smoothly) has been groomed from childhood to take the court as well as the accompanying perks of a good college (second quarter) great money and willing women. Monica with none of her neighbors opportunities but every bit of his talent nevertheless has remained devoted to her passion disciplining herself in ways that confound her ladylike stay-at-home mother (Alfre Woodard once again telegraphing maternal concern with her big communicative eyes). He needs to learn about fidelity; she needs remedial work in flexibility (third quarter). The two are hard-driving competitive professionals as absorbed in their work as say lawyers or journalists. Can they work out their problems? Thats the fourth-quarter suspense. On paper the conflicts may look overdiagrammed - Prince-Bythewood put in years as a writer on such TV series as ""A Different World"" and like many ""uplifting"" films that come out of the Sundance Institute you can see pencil marks from the playbook on screen. But the story of Quincy and Monica their personal clashes and their athletic dreams breaks away from other sports-themed dramas thanks to the clarity and dash of Prince-Bythewoods agile directorial style and the exciting originality of the subject. We just havent seen characters like these before. Lathan charismatic and beautifully strong holds the screen in every scene but the perceptive supporting cast is equally alive including Debbi Morgan (""Eves Bayou"") as Quincys mother whos married to an errant man rather than an NBA god and Harry J. Lennix (""Titus"") as Monicas mild but proud father. ""Love amp; Basketball"" gets a boost from the recent popularity of womens sports as spectator thrill no doubt about it. The speed and wiliness of the game itself ensure that movies about men who shoot hoops are exciting but the novelty of watching women bring their own physical grace to the contest is (as WNBA fever has proven) a turn-on. But Prince-Bythewood is also vigilant and honest about the hard sacrifices made in pursuit of sexual equality. And for that she scores big in her first pro game.

Starring Sanaa Lathan and Omar Epps. Written and directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood. (PG-13. 118 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Love and basketball -- if you like either one here is a movie for you. Sanaa Lathan and Omar Epps are a dream team in this disarming romance about a pair of next-door neighbors who both become big- time hoop stars and have to choose between the sport and each other. ""Love amp; Basketball"" follows the two Monica and Quincy through several stages of their lives beginning as 11-year-olds in a pickup game in which the boy throws the girl to the ground and gives her a lifelong facial scar. Its not the only scar he will inflict as they progress from high school pals to college lovers. Quincy is the son of an NBA star who doesnt always avoid basketball groupies; like father like son. ""Im a ball player"" declares the hot-tempered competitive Monica. Her mother in a compelling performance by Alfre Woodard fears for her tomboy child. The adult Monica finally has a decisive confrontation with her about women standing up for themselves. Writer-director Gina Prince-Bythewood takes her camera onto the court and into the middle of the action. Her first feature produced by Spike Lee was a hit at the Sundance Film Festival and now looks ready to break away from the pack. How do you tell the true lovers in this movie? Hint The true lovers love basketball as much as each other. -- Advisory Contains profanity and sex scenes. Bob Graham ""TESTAMENTO"" Comedy. Starring Nelson Xavier and Maria Ceica. Directed by Francisco Manso . (Not rated. 103 minutes. In Portuguese with English subtitles. At the Roxie Cinema.) ""Testamento"" is a special little comedy from Cape Verde a former Portuguese colony off the coast of West Africa. The setting is exotic; the landscapes are lush but the emotions are recognizably local -- goofy and human in a universal way. The picture features a towering performance from an actor few have heard of in our part of the world but what a rich talent. Nelson Xavier plays Araujo a Cape Verdean importer the wealthiest man in town who drops dead in the movies first seconds. The rest of the movie tells his story in a series of flashbacks. Xaviers range is a marvel. His Araujo is essentially a clown but one so dynamic and single-minded that it becomes understandable why he is attractive to women and successful in business. With a virtuosity reminiscent of Roberto Benigni he uses his voice as a dazzling comedic instrument rising to ear-splitting heights in moments of pomposity and exasperation. At the same time Xavier gives us moments of heartbreaking nakedness when Araujos pretense drops away and we see right into his pain. ""Testamento"" is no more and no less than a story of one mans life presented as something surreal absurd and vain -- yet ennobled by moments of haunting tenderness. -- Advisory This film contains nudity and strong language. Mick LaSalle ""GOSSIP"" Thriller. Starring James Marsden  Lena Headey and Kate Hudson . Directed by Davis Guggenheim . (R. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Gossip"" is a different kind of thriller that deals with the insidious nature of telling juicy stories. Three college students collaborating on a class project decide to plant one tantalizing but false story into the gossipy campus air. The story takes off like a mutating virus. Kate Hudson -- daughter of Goldie Hawn though its hard to tell here because she doesnt do much smiling -- plays the object of the gossip. She is a chaste young lady who passes out on a bed from drinking while fending off her dates sexual advances. The story is planted that she indeed had sex with the fellow. She believes the rumors and concludes that she was raped while unconscious. The picture follows the rumormongers. James Marsden who looks headed for stardom plays Derrick a complicated fellow with lots of secrets. The British actress Lena Headey plays Jones the films moral barometer who soon begins to suspect that this gossip thing wasnt such a hot idea. As directed by Davis Guggenheim ""Gossip"" has a high-gloss heightened style reminiscent of that of the films executive producer Joel Schumacher. A sense of unreality permeates the movie which allows for some far-fetched plot turns. Farfetched is OK. Close-fetched thrillers arent worth watching. -- Advisory This film contains violence and strong language. Mick LaSalle ""CROUPIER"" Film noir. Starring Clive Owen  Gina McKee  Alex Kingston and Kate Hardie . Directed by Mike Hodges . (Not rated. At the Galaxy. 91 minutes.) Life is a gamble the odds are against us and we dont know how its going to play out a new film from England tells us -- but we already knew that didnt we? Movies are a gamble too. Fortunately in the movies unlike gambling winning is not everything. ""Croupier"" is a very smart noir about gambling smartly directed by Mike Hodges -- until almost the very end. It craps out in the decisive London casino heist scene. For 95 percent of the way it is an engrossing tour of an attractively seamy side of life and a fascinating character study despite having a novelist for a hero. The main problem with having a writer hero is that not many in the audience care or want to identify with one. The film overcomes this by giving the writer another more interesting occupation. As a croupier Jack Manfred can remain on the sidelines and observe people fodder for his writing. The film narrators voice we come to realize is the voice of Jack-the-novelist. As played by Clive Owen first blond and then dark-haired he is extraordinarily cool with a noncommittal slightly insolent look. Women cant resist him including a self- deluded ex-hooker who seems to want to start over as a virgin a femme fatale gambler and Jacks girlfriend who is interestingly a house detective in a department store. The best gambling scene with a very funny payoff occurs not at the casino but at a private after-hours poker party. Croupier by the way in this film is pronounced in the wonderfully defiant English style as if it were not a French word at all -- crew-pee-er. Bob Graham ""X"" Japanese animation. Directed by Rintaro. (Not rated. 98 minutes. Dubbed in English. Today through April 27 at the Lumiere and Rafael Film Center in San Rafael; today through April 25 at the UC Theatre in Berkeley.) Is humankind strong enough to direct its own destiny or is fate a locked-in thing that resists our greatest efforts? Thats the question posed in ""X"" a disappointing Japanese anime. Directed by Rintaro with a story developed by the all-female Japanese animation studio Clamp ""X"" is set in 1999 the Year of Destiny where a young man is endowed with extraordinary powers. Kamui is given his orders by Mother a nude and bodacious figure who we assume symbolizes the earths aching spirit. Mother briefs Kamui on the conflict at hand two armies the Dragons of the Earth and the Dragons of the Heaven want dominion of the universe. If one prevails humanity would be snuffed so the universe can re-purify itself; if the other wins the physical world would vanish to protect humanity. Our hero also meets Hinoto and Kanoe clairvoyant sisters who try to influence him with their opposing oracles as well as Karen the Stripper an aging tart who sighs ""I went to work in brothels where no one asks questions. Tokyo may be a terrible place to live but I love it."" Kamui learns that the seven stars of the Big Dipper have created power shields that protect Tokyo and the rest of the Earth. The more he hears the more hes resistant to being chosen the jobs way too much for an innocent kid. Everything in this kinetic post- apocalyptic cartoon is drawn in big strokes. The colors and bold and vibrant the graphics dynamic and the animation a riot of movement. Too bad the plotting is jumbled and the characters too numerous and undifferentiated. -- Advisory This movie contains violent images and bare-breasted animated figures. Edward Guthmann ..

"Love amp; Basketball | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; love-basketball ) Love amp; Basketball (United States 2000) A movie review by James Berardinelli Love amp; Basketball is as one can infer from the title about love and basketball. The film follows the lives of two next-door neighbors one male and one female from their first meeting on the court at the age of 11 until a fateful night a dozen years in the future. Through all this time their passion for basketball is equaled only by their passion for each other but its never clear for either of them which takes precedence - the game or the relationship. In the final analysis the feature debut of writer/director Gina Prince-Bythewood (backed by producer Spike Lee) succeeds better as a sports movie than as a romance. While the sports clichA(c)s are kept to a minimum in favor of a Hoop Dreams-type view of basketball the love story follows a familiar trajectory. The two protagonists are Monica Wright (Sanaa Latham) and Quincy McCall (Omar Epps). She is determined to become the first woman ever to enter the NBA; he is driven by the need to better the accomplishments of his father Zeke (Dennis Haysbert) a star for the Los Angeles Clippers. Love amp; Basketball is divided into ""quarters"" like a basketball game with each segment chronicling a different period in Monica and Quincys lives. The first quarter set in 1981 details their meeting and their brief relationship as an 11-year old ""couple."" The second quarter skips ahead seven years to high school where both Monica and Quincy are stars. However since hes a male and shes a female his future in the sport appears to be set while hers is uncertain. When it comes to choosing a college she has to wait anxiously to hear from a recruiter while he plans a press conference to announce his choice. Quarter 3 transpires during the pairs freshman year at college when she faces pressure from a demanding coach and he struggles with salacious revelations about his father. Finally in the fourth quarter the film shows the degree to which Monica and Quincys dreams are realized both on and off the court. Although Love amp; Basketballs story does not pack an emotional wallop it tells an engaging tale about how the things that seem to be the most important in life arent always so. On the surface that might appear to be a trite message but Prince-Bythewoods screenplay has two elements to distinguish it vivid characters and a female perspective on a genre that is typically dominated by testosterone-saturated motion pictures. Along with the yet-to-be-released Girlfight Love amp; Basketball affirms that sports (and sports movies) are not the lone purview of men. Prince-Bythewood makes a valiant attempt to balance the screen time given to Quincy with that accorded to Monica as well as to afford an equal hearing to the complexities of their individual stories. However it doesnt take long for the viewer to recognize that Love amp; Basketball is really Monicas story. She is the better developed character and its clear that the writer/director understands and sympathizes with her more than with Quincy. Thats not to say that his character is ignored or constructed out of bits and pieces of other sports movie protagonists; Quincy is allowed to shine - just not as brightly as Monica. Love amp; Basketballs structure offers a way to cover 12 years in one movie but it is a little cumbersome. The movie feels longer than it needs to be with segments 2 and 3 both dragging in places. Prince-Bythewoods approach also demands a certain level of suspension of disbelief. During the earliest time period two younger actors (Kyla Pratt and Glenndon Chatman) stand in for Monica and Quincy but starting with the high school years its Lathan and Epps. And while Lathan might be able to pass for a teenager theres no chance for Epps who looks every day of his 26 years. Both leads give strong performances with Lathans work slightly overshadowing Epps (as one might expect from a movie in which the focus is slanted towards the female lead). There is a strong chemistry between them and both are capable of carrying scenes on their own. Theyre also athletic enough to make the basketball scenes believable. The most impressive supporting performance is turned in by Dennis Haysbert who plays Quincys all-too-human father. As Monicas mother Alfre Woodard is underused although she does have one nice scene opposite Lathan. Also appearing are Harry J. Lennix as Monicas supportive father and Debbi Morgan as Quincys long-suffering mother. Even though every major cast member of Love amp; Basketball is black the film is essentially color-blind. However while race is a non-issue gender is not. The film illustrates among other things the vast gulf of inequality that exists between male and female athletes. By dramatizing Monica and Quincys lives in parallel Pince-Bythewood is able to explore the inequities. Despite having the same drive ambition and passion they cannot reach the same peak nor are the plateaus along the way on the same level. For example Monicas high school games are played in front of a sparse crowd while Quincys take place in a packed gymnasium. Attention to details like this place Love amp; Basketball a step or two ahead of the competition. Although not a slam-dunk its a satisfying lay-up.
