"Jupiter Ascending - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Jupiter Ascending Posted by Christy Lemire on February 10 2015 2 Comments Warner Bros. Pictures. Rated PG-13 for some violence sequences of sci-fi action some suggestive content and partial nudity. Running time 125 minutes. One and a half stars out of four. Its difficult to tell whether ""Jupiter Ascending"" the latest sci-fi extravaganza from the writing-directing Wachowski siblings intends to be as hilarious as it is. Some elements -- Eddie Redmaynes entire performance as a preening scheming galactic prince for instance -- clearly have been dipped in deep vats of rich and gooey camp. Others -- the romance that kinda-sorta blossoms between Mila Kunis as a cleaning lady who learns shes the queen of the universe and Channing Tatum as the flying half-man/half-dog who protects her -- are inherently ridiculous but also seem to be aiming for an awkward sweetness. (""Awkward"" being the key word here.) But then there are the giant set pieces which feature a few thrilling moments but more often are generically shiny and noisy displays of infinite pixels on parade. A lot of people spent a lot of time and a lot of money making a lot of movie but theres not much there. The spectacle is simultaneously outsized and dumbed-down. If there is no heart to go along with the hardware why bother? Lana and Andy Wachowski and a team of thousands have come up with a movie thats overstuffed and overblown visually but its populated with characters drawn so wispily a breeze could blow them away. Kunis can be enormously appealing in comedies (""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"") and dramas (""Black Swan""). Here in this hodge-podge of genres she never seizes the authority her character achieves. Her Jupiter Jones goes from scrubbing toilets for Chicagos elite to reigning over everyone as reincarnated galactic royalty but until the end she remains a damsel in distress -- a troubled heroine who finds herself literally and repeatedly plummeting to her doom until her hunky protector swoops in to save her. Its baffling that having transitioned from being a man in recent years Lana Wachowski would co-create a female character who (in theory) is supposed to be strong and brave but (in truth) is rather wide-eyed and passive. Heres how it all goes down as Kunis explains in the films opening voiceover (which instantly made me think of Meg from ""Family Guy"" an idea I had a hard time shaking) Jupiter a Russian immigrant is born in dramatic fashion under a cosmic confluence of events. But she ends up living a rather dreary blue-collar life crammed into an apartment with her relatives (who are consistently played for arent-they-wacky? laughs). As she toils away day after day she dreams of something greater. And not unlike Neo in the Wachowskis ""Matrix"" series (the last truly groundbreaking thing the siblings did -- the first one at least) it turns out Jupiter is The One. Shes the genetic recurrence of an ancient space queen. In no time shes being whisked away into the stars with the help of the muscular misunderstood Caine (Tatum with bleach-blonde hair pointy ears and eyeliner). Hes a ""splice"" -- a genetically engineered mix of human with some kind of werewolf -- and a former bounty hunter whos been sent to Earth to fetch her. (The versatile Tatum gets little more to do here than show up at the right time and fight.) But others also want to capture her for their nefarious purposes which brings us to the first of many times Jupiter falls from some great heights only to have Caine zoom in with his jet-powered boots to save her. This first big action sequence -- an elaborate chase over downtown Chicago featuring shape-shifting fighter planes -- is indeed a doozy though. With the help of another splice an old acquaintance of Caines named Stinger (Sean Bean bringing actual presence and depth) Caine carries Jupiter to her ultimate destination in the sky. There she finds herself in the midst of a bitter sibling land grab -- or rather a planet grab. Theres the radiant and smooth-talking sister Kalique Abrasax (Tuppence Middleton); the obsequious and menacing Titus Abrasax (Douglas Booth); and finally Redmaynes evil Balem Abrasax. Heres his deal He whispers about 90 percent of his lines but then out of nowhere shouts the other 10 percent. It is an amazingly showy vampy performance -- one with the kind of risks that his solid Oscar-nominated work as Stephen Hawking in ""The Theory of Everything"" could never allow -- and its one of the few aspects of ""Jupiter Ascending"" which truly entertain. What all these actors are stuck saying though ranges from the inane to the indecipherable. The dialogue is crammed with exposition about the dense mythology of this outlandish interplaneary realm and its many colorful species of citizens yet its actual narrative remains so mind-bogglingly complicated it was often hard to follow. An amusing sequence which leaves the starry skies for the dreary corridors and offices of bureaucracy (where steampunk style is all the rage) almost seems to acknowledge as much. And with the various planets and high-tech interiors often looking the same its sometimes hard to keep track of who is doing what to whom and where and why it matters. The costume design is exquisite though -- the work of the Wachowskis longtime designer Kym Barrett. The gowns especially are richly ornate knockouts including the one featured in the photo above when Jupiter descends upon her own arranged wedding. But Barrett also gives the looks an edge by dabbling in borderline Samp;M gear. It was enough to make me wish I was watching ""Jupiter Ascending The Fashion Show"" rather than ""Jupiter Ascending"" the movie with all its pesky encumbrances of dialogue and plot.

Yes.... I really hope Eddies career does not take too big a knock as theory of every thing was sublime. Highlander 2 the Quickening pretty much sums up the idea which spawned this ugly carcass of spew. Ugh Then again  Highlander 2 was a much better film gimme Ecke v Sayer any day.

Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) is an undocumented Russian immigrant who lives in Chicago and works as a toilet-scrubber. Shes teleported to a super-advanced planet; according to its laws her genetic code makes her the new queen of Earth and she becomes the object of a battle royale. The late queen left three heirs--the sinister Balem (Eddie Redmayne) the insinuating Kalique (Tuppence Middleton) and the unctuous Titus (Douglas Booth)--and they need Jupiters consent in order to ""harvest"" humans for their rejuvenating lotion. The Wachowskis create a churning swooping C.G.I. universe thats decorated to the corners of the frame without taste or imagination. Their sense of style does convey an idea deeply embedded in the digital muck the conflict of modern democracy and Old World monarchy. The royal heirs are played by a trio of British actors and their dominion is filled with neo-medieval architecture and the metal knickknacks to match. For her troubles Jupiter doesnt get a better job or an education; she gets her Prince Channing--an interplanetary warrior played by Mr. Tatum.      --Richard Brody Goings On A free New York City events app What to do tonight Follow goingson About Us FAQ Strongbox Customer Care Cartoon Bank On The Town RSS Contact Us The New Yorker Store Careers Reprints/Permissions Press The New Yorker Media Kit Conde Nast Digital Subscribe to a magazine View All Titles - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Bon Appetit Brides Conde Nast Traveler Details Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Lucky Self Teen Vogue The New Yorker Vanity Fair Vogue W Wired Other Conde Nast sites - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Ars Technica Bon Appetit Brides.com Conde Nast Traveler Concierge Details Epicurious Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Hotel Chatter Jaunted Lucky NutritionData Reddit The Scene Self Style Teen Vogue Vanity Fair Vegas Chatter Vogue W Wired Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement (effective January 1 2014) and Privacy Policy (effective January 1 2014).

I have more in common with a dog than I have with you.""""Ive always loved dogs.""Jupiter Ascending the 175 million space opera written and directed by Lana and Andy Wachowski has a few moments of intentional humor. It has several more moments of unintentional humor. And it has moments of humor--such as the exchange above--that defy categorization altogether.Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) an ordinary earthling thrust into the middle of a cosmic conspiracy has just declared her love for Caine Wise (Channing Tatum) an extraterrestrial human-wolf hybrid with a knack for rescuing her from trouble. He rebuffs her affections on quasi-bestiality grounds and she responds with a declaration of canophilia. The entire audience with whom I saw the film erupted into guffaws. But Im not sure any of us quite knew whether we were laughing with the movie or at it.There are moments of charm or almost-charm scattered throughout Jupiter Ascending and with a lighter touch it might have worked as a whimsical space fantasy--a kind of third-rate Guardians of the Galaxy. But the Wachowskis lack such a touch (as they have their entire careers) and instead strive for a parable about love and class that eludes them utterly. Jupiter Ascending is too self-serious a movie to offer silly escapism and too silly a movie to take at all seriously.Related Story The Earthly Disappointments of Cloud Atlas When the story begins Jupiter is a young Russian immigrant living with her extended working-class family in Chicago. Every morning her alarm goes off at 445 a.m. and she her mother and her aunt begin a long day cleaning the homes of rich folks; Jupiters specific task is scrubbing the toilets. Until one day when her shiftless cousin persuades her to sell her eggs to a fertility clinic for 15000 so that he can buy an entertainment center and she can buy a telescope. (Her father murdered during a break-in before she was born was an astronomer. Hence Jupiter.) When she visits the clinic however she is set upon by murderous aliens and saved by Caine.It turns out that the human race extends far across the galaxy and Earth is but the tiny colony of a vast empire. Worse it is slated for imminent ""harvest."" (I wont say precisely what this means because it is the subject of a Big Reveal late in the film. But if you havent figured it out within the first 20 minutes its probably because youve fallen asleep.) Unbeknownst to her Jupiter is the exact genetic duplicate of a deceased interstellar matriarch and as such the lawful inheritor of the Earth itself. Unfortunately said matriarch had three children (played by Eddie Redmayne Douglas Booth and Tuppence Middleton) none of whom are inclined to let Jupiter keep her prize. Trouble predictably ensues.Kunis is perfectly solid as the decent ingenuous dog-loving Jupiter though the character makes for a remarkably feeble heroine. Her principal function in the film is to be hoodwinked in sequence by every one of the movies astro-schemers and to require rescuing by Caine approximately once every 15 minutes for just over two hours. One would be hard-pressed to find a less capable female protagonist in contemporary cinema. Moreover despite the films aspirations of intergalactic (and inter-species) romance she and Tatum have no discernible chemistry.Maybe its the ears? Befitting his genetic heritage Caines are tall and pointy and accompanied by a lupine goatee and elongated canines. He is also predisposed to theatrical sniffing and on occasion snarling. Picture a burlier version of Johnny Depps Big Bad Wolf from Into the Woods and you wont be far off. Its worth noting however that whereas Depps performance was a self-parodying cameo Tatum is the male lead. Woof.Caine is also predisposed to theatrical sniffing and on occasion snarling.The rest of the cast fares little better. Sean Bean shows up as an old colleague of Caines described as a ""Han Solo-type character"" which is always a bad sign. Gugu Mbatha-Raw (Belle Beyond the Lights) has a small role as a functionary sporting ears that look like flattened sweet potatoes. (I had to look online to learn that this is because her character was genetically spliced with a deer. Why? I have no idea. The film is mercifully devoid of sleighs.) And one can only imagine how dearly Best-Actor-nominated Redmayne must hope that no one casting an Oscar ballot catches his performance here which consists of one long wheezing whisper punctuated by occasional Pacino-esque barks.Visually the movie has its moments--for 175 million youd hope it would--notable among them the gravity skates that allow Caine to slalom through the air. But more often than not the effects and production design feel openly derivative and already slightly out-of-date. There are conspicuous echoes of Stars Wars The Fifth Element Transformers Men In Black Brazil (Terry Gilliam has a small cameo) Signs and at least a dozen more. And dont even get me started on the aliens many of whom would have been turned away from the cantina door in Mos Eisley. A rat hybrid played by Edward Hogg seems to have wandered in from a 1980s production of Cats and the winged leather-jacket-clad Lizard Men heavies look as though they should probably find some Ninja Turtles to menace.The plot of the movie is cursory at best with a narrative coda so insipid it made my head hurt. The dialogue is comically bad (""Bees are genetically designed to respond to royalty""; ""In our world genes have an almost spiritual significance"") and the action sequences are repetitive to the point of redundancy.Its been a long time--arguably more than 15 years--since the Wachowskis made a good movie. But the one trait for which they deserve genuine credit is their tenacious commitment to an independent vision of blockbuster filmmaking. Despite its many many flaws Jupiter Ascending is not a sequel prequel reboot spinoff or ""pre-sold"" property of any kind and these days that is no small thing. Hollywoods risk aversion and franchise addiction are a real and worsening problem. Alas Jupiter Ascending is unlikely to persuade anyone of the virtues of originality.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s.

Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Photo Warner Bros The Wachowski siblings sci-fi thriller Jupiter Ascending is inane from first frame to last -- the dialogue is so clunky I wondered if George Lucas had been brought in to do the rewrite. But its not much fun enumerating the movies infelicities. As they proved in their Matrix trilogy Speed Racer and Cloud Atlas Lana and Andy do nothing halfway and even a formula picture like this packs in so much physical detail and philosophical subtext that you feel as if you should be dazzled -- that you somehow owe it to them to keep watching and hoping that the next sequence will be halfway involving. Their protagonist is once again a person dulled by ordinary life who turns out to be something other than she seems destined from birth a itas in her genes a for higher things. This is Jupiter (Mila Kunis) born to a Russian mother and a father murdered by robbers while looking through a telescope and rubbing Vaseline on his wife; no wonder she turns out to be the reincarnation of the queen of one of the universeas most powerful dynasties. But Iam getting ahead of myself. As in The Matrix her mundane existence (she cleans toilets while hyperethnic Russkis holler at her) is ruptured by one set of seeming superbeings trying to kill her and another trying to save her. Her savior is the muscular half-canine Caine Wise (Channing Tatum a who obviously knows how ridiculous he looks but carries on manfully) and though heas something of a mercenary he proves rousingly adept at fending off squiggly CG aliens and actors in costumes that would be laughed out of a Greenwich Village Halloween parade. Leading the family of decadent aristocrats who keep trying to kill Jupiter is Balem played by Eddie Redmayne who should hire large men to keep Oscar voters out of theaters. He talks in the wispiest of rasps as if too rich to be bothered to engage his diaphragm. (""I have more important matters to attend"" he tells his brother as if too rich to be bothered to add the final preposition.) Balem is the Wachowskis Uber-capitalist a man who believes that he has reached a Darwinian state of perfection and is entitled to feed -- literally -- on the lumpen. The Matrix trilogy showed machines using humans as flesh batteries; here humans are cattle their planets destined to be harvested so that the elites may live for millennia. But the most powerful source of Balems evil isnt ideological. He has -- wouldnt you know -- mother issues. And mother is now genetically speaking back from the great beyond. Jupiter Ascending would be vastly more enjoyable with a more ascendant Jupiter. Apparently not a very nice person Kunis is not a very good actress either. Her dark beauty is certainly exotic but her features barely move and her voice -- apart from the occasional fry -- has no color. Its as if someone put a lot of eyeliner on Minnie Mouse. Jupiter is supposed to be resolutely earthbound; she says things like ""I need to know what in the world is going on here"" and ""Could this get any weirder?"" even as aliens drop to their knees and honeybees form reverent clouds. But Kunis cant begin to suggest the capacious soul thats supposedly within. Thats too bad because whatever heart there is in Jupiter Ascending comes from the Wachowskis conviction that our true selves are hidden deep within our genetic codes and that the goal of life is to recognize and cultivate them. Without that emotional core the movie is like an old Flash Gordon installment with a thousand times the budget and a tenth the fun. Its miraculously unmiraculous.

"Star Wreck The Noble Badness of the Wachowskis Jupiter Ascending Trumps the Abominable Seventh Son << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Star Wreck The Noble Badness of the Wachowskis Jupiter Ascending Trumps the Abominable Seventh Son Warner Bros. Movies February 6 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print We consumers of American popular culture have accepted the virtues of certain kinds of badness. We know camp and kitsch and trash. Empire on Fox is currently medaling in all three events. The badness on that show or any soap opera sublimates the gutter into glamour. Thats easy. Earnest honest-to-goodness this-is-who-I-really-am badness is of a different order of magnitude in which the artist (its an art by the way) risks eternal embarrassment -- or least permanent skepticism -- in order to say something personal. Think of the so-called Kimye marriage project or Robin Thicke on his album Paula last summer earnestly nakedly bad. So when two filmmakers decide to send an assimilated Russian immigrant who scrubs toilets in Chicago into an outer-space action-adventure pay attention. Why? Because her name is Jupiter Jones and shes played by Mila Kunis instead of I dont know Pam Grier. Because Caine Wise the bleach-blond goat-eared leather-clad tracker whos surfing her there -- via rockets in his boots -- appears to be part man part farm animal part West Hollywood rent boy. Because these two have fallen in love and cant get up. Because love is the only navigable emotion in a swampy epic production that not only destroys downtown Chicago but is considerate enough -- unlike say the average Michael Bay movie -- to rebuild it instantly. The two filmmakers are Lana and Andy Wachowski. Their new movie Jupiter Ascending mixes sleepiness and excitement Channing Tatum and Eddie Redmayne emotional clarity and narrative confusion too much and not enough. The universe is endless Earth is but a coveted pebble and Jupiter Jones is we eventually learn a ""recurrence."" Her genetic profile has caught the attention of three millennia-old siblings in some other galaxy Balem (Redmayne) Kalique (Tuppence Middleton) and Titus (Douglas Booth). After their mothers scandal-shrouded death they now lead the House of Abrasax a name that conjures images of the warring factions from the masterpiece documentary Paris Is Burning in which the House of LaBeija could be counted on to do battle against the House of Chanel. What the movie lacks in drag balls it makes up for in chaotic shootouts chase sequences and Redmaynes impersonation of a deathbed Andy Warhol sniping with Booths seemingly ambisexual boy-bitch. Balem is enough of a high-maintenance individualist to make you think the dead mother is actually Ayn Rand. The recurrence in question is that of Mother Abrasax who has bequeathed our solar system to these three. Jupiter appears to share her genes making her royal too -- and therefore powerful and as entitled to dynastic spoils. So Titus has dispatched Caine (Tatum) to bring her to him. But a gang of Balem-affiliated bounty hunters is also on the scene which is how you wind up with action sequences set amid alleyway fire escapes and in a cornfield. Upon exiting my wearied delight with Jupiter Ascending coexisted with pure bafflement. (Did a black woman in the form of a chariot truly transport Redmayne to an event? I believe a black woman did do that.) But I exited knowing that Id seen a movie no other filmmaker could have made. Jupiter Ascending is about heeding cosmic and genetic destiny and it is of a piece with what the Wachowskis believe is their artistic destiny the fight against human vacuousness and their belief in the fight to become who you know you are rather than who youve been programmed to be. Jupiter Ascending and their previous film Cloud Atlas are the first since Lana Wachowski came out as transgender and now their ponderousness has a loose sloshing crazy quality. Their filmmaking seems in its way free. In the pursuit of some higher truth the Wachowskis have perfected earnest badness. The plot here rehashes the ideas of human exploitation in the three increasingly overwrought Matrix films and the belief in reincarnation from Cloud Atlas but with less surprise. Ideas fuel the plot but the movie is incoherent from set piece to set piece. Its not arguing as passionately as the other four movies especially Cloud Atlas which is as absurdly optimistic a vision of race and identity in the movies as youll ever see. The Wachowskis are committed to questioning the complacency of identity like that Henry Louis Gates discover-your-roots show or TLCs Who Do You Think You Are? -- which really should be called How Black Is This Very Famous Person? The Matrix trilogy and Cloud Atlas made space-time odysseys out of struggle against a kind of predeterminism. There is no struggle in Jupiter Ascending just a lot of handsome pomp and noise and makeup and costumes and production. (Here the actors of color -- like Gugu Mbatha-Raw Nikki Amuka-Bird and Bae Doona -- show up ornamentally for two or three short scenes as help and hindrance then vanish.) Its fabulousness is ultimately in the service of itself. Also Lana and Andy lack the contrasting coconspirator they had on Cloud Atlas in Tom Tykwer a director who brings different heat and speed and navigability to his movies. It must be said as well that Jupiter Ascending falls under so many influences -- Terry Gilliam George Lucas Luc Besson The Wizard of Oz Carl Sagan 2001 A Space Odyssey Tom Hulce in Amadeus Bjork on the cover of Homogenic -- that all the visions blur and compete. After a while youre watching a malfunctioning kaleidoscope as much as a movie. Theres no outside source material to push back against the way there was with David Mitchells novel in Cloud Atlas. Thats probably why you wind up with sulking transparent dialogue like ""The more you care the more the world tries to find ways to punish you for it."" But there are moments of loveliness along the way such as when Caine and Jupiter show up at the farm of an earthbound fellow tracker (Sean Bean) whose farmhouse is infested with bees that seem to defer to Jupiter. Theres another in which Balem in his space palace has paused a replay of Caines rescue of Jupiter from his hunters and you cant take your eyes off of Tatum floating in an amniotic state up toward the right-hand corner of the screen. Weve now been trained to watch a Wachowski movie looking for state-of-the-art technology to achieve a milestone in the way the first two Matrix movies did. A moment like that doesnt seem like much. But with a movie thats available in 3-D that slowest-motion shot provides a reason to want to touch the screen. The scenes of Tatum power-skating and surfing across the sky and away from the films many infernos are oddly magical. Getting around that way looks hard and Tatum doesnt look embarrassed to be pretending to do it. He looks soulfully committed to the exertion of all that energy. Hes better here than he is in something like Foxcatcher which needs an actor who can tell you whats going on even when his lips arent moving. Hes one of those stars whos better in motion with physical work to do. He almost never stops moving here. Kunis is a different story. Shes the coolest least urgent actor Ive ever seen running from explosions and raining debris. Its as if she wants you to know its all make-believe to see the green screen. In the action sequences shes working against the siblings humanity mission. She wants you to know shes a prop. As for the Wachowskis what youre looking for in all of these crashing styles and amid all the grand earnestness is some sense theyre moving too -- forward toward something new to do. Here its outright comedy. The sequence in which Jupiters royal credentials have to be confirmed is a brief excursion into bureaucratic farce. Its a marvelous sequence in which the editing acting and camera placement just make you laugh as does Gilliam who shows up for a self-tributing cameo. More of that sort of filmmaking please Lana and Andy. Still it remains odd watching them work with the loose caricatured reality of everyday people without the immediate coating of science fiction as they do in the dining-table sequences with Jupiter and her big Russian family. Its as if to them normal folks are from outer space. Jupiter mentions that shes got a date and the table erupts with excitement. ""Is he Russian?"" ""Is he rich?"" ""Whats his sign?"" Its like the foreplay not for a space opera but for a movie genre on a faraway planet the Wachowskis should consider exploring the musical.  Sometimes you get halfway through a movie and you cant believe that what youre seeing made its way from Los Angeles or someones Los Angeles computer to where youre sitting. Its so dreary dumb and brutally dull. You cant believe that no one thought to ask whether itd be fun to watch Jeff Bridges and his apprentice Ben Barnes defeat a parade of villains played by women and people of color who can turn into killer beasts. This isnt the worst thing about Seventh Son. The worst thing is that it exists at all. But it says a lot that no one thought to give Julianne Moore and Djimon Hounsou for starters more to do than vamp and growl. The plot requires Barnes led by the sorcerer a ""spook"" played by Bridges to track down a powerful gemstone that has fallen into the hands of Moores dark witch. Theres an enchanted girl (Alicia Vikander) for Barnes to fall in love with. Yes its one of those medieval-ish romance-fantasy plots. It wouldnt be such a chore to sit through if the movie were made with any sense of pacing or care. Its designed to get a franchise going. Actual entertainment tends to feel very much beside the point. These are grim times for staging action sequences. The barnyard finale for instance of The Boy Next Door looks as if its been staged by the animals. As directed by Sergei Bodrov the combat in Seventh Son is quick and indecipherable and indifferent. You get better stuntmanship in two or three hours of a professional wrestling broadcast. For all that doesnt work about the Wachowskis movie you never get the sense the siblings dont believe in what theyre doing. Bridges Moore and Hounsou for his couple of scenes at least proceed with little concern for embarrassment. They are professionals. Bridges no longer seems to care what an audience will think. Even when hes just lazily doing Sean Connery in Highlander and Richard Harris in almost everything he is really just doing The Dude. The fun of Redmayne in Jupiter Ascending is that his hammy villainy can be played against the prevailing nobility of the larger exercise. Seventh Son leans hard on its stars shamelessness but after a while you wish they had a little more shame.

Plenty. This sci-fi-inflected fantasy has many a wince-worthy romantic exchange between stars Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis. There was also a smattering of applause as the credits rolled. This added one more question to all the puzzlements of a mess of a plot Who are these people? Such is the effect the Wachowskis elicit these days. The siblings continue to have loyalists even as their films over the years have called into question the promise of their bold arrival as the mavericks who took introduced us to the Matrix. When last we were in their company they had taken on the expansive reincarnation novel ""Cloud Atlas.""David Mitchells lauded epic made for a less celebrated film. Me I liked the movie that recast characters over the span of centuries and found a throughline in enslavement and liberation. And compared with this fantasy flick it is a masterpiece. In ""Jupiter Ascending"" the filmmakers return to the theme of reincarnation sort of. Kunis portrays Jupiter Jones the daughter of a Russian mother (Maria Doyle Kennedy) and a British astrophysicist dad (James DArcy). When he meets an early end Jupiter her mother and their extended family settle in Chicago. This collection of bickering kin is Jupiters ""terrestrial family."" She is also the product of a rare galactic event known as a ""recurrence."" She is the genomic ""recurrence"" of Seraphi Abrasax matriarch of a cosmic dynasty. The three heirs of that empire are none too pleased at the ultra-rare recurrence. Tatum portrays Caine Wise the genetically tweaked hunter sent by one of Seraphis progeny to find the unsuspecting Jupiter. Hes not the only one on her trail. A zipping and soaring dodging and explosive rescue-chase leads Jupiter and Caine to a ramshackle farmhouse surrounded by acres of green cornstalks. There Caines one-time friend and ally Stinger Apini (Sean Bean) confirms Jupiters cosmic status. This toilet-bowl cleaner and housekeeper to the better-off is beyond royalty. Oscar nominee Eddie Redmayne gets his repressed freak on as eldest son Balem who stands to inherit the jewel in their crown a blue marble of a planet called Earth. Youngest Titus (Douglas Booth) has his own plans for mum. Daughter Kalique (Tuppence Middleton) has a more subtle approach. Galactic millennia before there was a guy named Machiavelli these siblings and their mother were practiced at the art of scheming and betraying wholesale colonizing planets and worse. What will become of the more- human-than-imperial Jupiter and her doggedly loyal protector? That might have proved an intriguing even touching quandary had the heart of the story not been engulfed by the bloated (though oddly not wowing) spectacle. Kunis is not a bad choice for a hero. There is something earthy and present about the actress. And there are brief glimmers of the compassionate regard the Wachowskis always have for their characters but they are extremely faint. The best-realized scene -- and quite a funny one -- finds Jupiter Caine and a bureaucrat trying to negotiate the frustrations of a broken system. Terry Gilliam makes a witty cameo appearance in this ""Brazil""-like interlude. Mostly ""Jupiter Ascending"" is cosmic corn at best. Or perhaps given the films excessive twists and not quite believable turns we should call it a maze.

Its easy to make fun of Andy and Lana Wachowskis long-gestating universe-spanning science-fiction epic ""Jupiter Ascending."" So easy in fact as to be irresistible. We may as well indulge that for a minute before trying to figure out what happened here. This movie often plays like a super-expensive 21st-century version of one of those ""Star Wars"" knockoffs made around 1980 by people who werent George Lucas. It has Channing Tatum in Spock ears and a cute little goatee zooming around on Atomic Anti-Gravity Rollerblades. It has Mila Kunis as an orphaned immigrant scrubbing toilets in Chicago who is actually the queen of the universe but doesnt know it yet. It has the kind of jumbled pseudo-spectacular overdecorated digital design that the eye and mind cant really take in. Individual shots can be gorgeous but there are just too damn many of them and the overall experience is the visual equivalent of eating an entire wedding cake.OK I think its more accurate to say that Jupiter Jones Kunis character is just queen of our chunk of the universe not the whole thing. Maybe theres an online guide somewhere that explains what the hell is going on in ""Jupiter Ascending"" - or maybe there would be if anyone cared which honestly makes me sad. At any rate Jupiter gets dragged into some kind of cosmic royal-family turf war and/or hambone acting competition between Eddie Redmayne and Tuppence Middleton playing a pair of decadent semi-immortal beings whose attitude toward you and me is not benevolent. She also has power over bees which is pretty awesome. The plot of ""Jupiter Ascending"" consists almost entirely of Jupiter getting enticed or coerced into really bad decisions - like an Alexander McQueen-style wedding with another godlike entity named Titus (Douglas Booth) a fellow so vain and pretty and metrosexual he makes David Beckham circa 2002 look like a fishing buddy of Hemingway - and then getting rescued by intergalactic pointy-eared bad boy Tatum and his atomic boots.Seriously the Wachowskis progressive credentials take a pretty hard hit here which is certainly not the only sense in which ""Jupiter Ascending"" feels like a backward journey but is still kind of depressing. I get that this movie is supposed to recall classic fairytales (the one about Cinderella in particular) and old-fashioned comic books and space-opera serials of the 40s and 50s all at the same time. But Jupiter is a radically retrograde character even by those standards and Kunis - at her best a fiery screen performer with a streak of sexy and a streak of tomboy - never seems comfortable as a doe-eyed innocent who is the focus of everyones attention. Jupiter has less female agency than any character ever played by Doris Day. Compared to this movie the Disneyfied feminism of ""Frozen"" and ""Brave"" and ""Maleficent"" feels like Valerie Solanas ""SCUM Manifesto.""Im not really having any fun hurling these barbs though. I come pretty close to being a Wachowski loyalist and Im itching to defend ""Jupiter Ascending"" despite the fact that its basically terrible. Maybe if I take it home and feed it warm milk from a bottle it will get better I am a person who really liked ""Cloud Atlas"" I did not personally much enjoy ""Speed Racer"" a film that inflicted measurable brain damage on its audience but I will nod along while other people defend it. I am pretty nearly the worlds biggest fan of ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and according to me ""The Matrix Revolutions"" never happened at all. Andy and Lana do not need my protection or my sympathy of course. They created a globe-shifting culture-jamming metaphor that was also one of the greatest genre movies of all time and thats more than enough. How they got from there to here is somewhat mysterious - but then a lot of Wordsworths later poetry is pretty cantankerous and awful and that does nothing to devalue ""Tintern Abbey."" You Might Also Like There are some dazzling action sequences in ""Jupiter Ascending"" but nothing you havent seen in a dozen other films within the last year. The elaborate action choreography the Wachowskis pioneered and perfected almost a generation ago has so thoroughly permeated Hollywood cinema that weve reached saturation point. I would say the same thing about the crazy architectural melange of Gothic and neoclassical and futuristic and Victorian and WTF design backdrops all of it conspicuously unreal as the action leaps from planet to planet palace to palace. Its like an everything-must-go garage sale of European history held on the moon. We could be in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" or ""Man of Steel"" or the ""Thor"" franchise or damn near anything else in the Hollywood picture book of sameness. Certainly the Wachowskis helped create this aesthetic along with Christopher Nolan - but so far hes done a better job wriggling free from it. (""Interstellar"" was a mixed bag but its nothing like his Batman movies.)There are some memorable scenes in ""Jupiter Ascending"" including Tuppence Middleton bathing in a glowing hot tub full of youth-restoring goo whose origins resemble those of Soylent Green. There are moments when the goofy pulp romance between Jupiter and Tatums character a Han Solo-type renegade named Caine feels poised to take off. (Tatum as always is a source of unflappable good cheer even with those ears.) Redmayne as the most evil of all the evil demigods delivers his lines in a drawling stage whisper redolent with many millennia of upper-class depravity and the very best sherry. Hes about 200 times more enjoyable here than playing Stephen Hawking in ""The Theory of Everything"" which makes the second bad movie this week in which a likely 2014 Oscar-winner outdoes his or her prestige performance. (See also Moore Julianne; ""Seventh Son"" vs. ""Still Alice."")Core Wachowski themes of class warfare and the predatory pyramidal nature of capitalism are dimly ascertainable here Redmayne Middleton and Booth essentially play members of the top one-trillionth of 1 percent those who feast on our bones when theyre not too thoroughly bored by the nature of existence to bother. If you squint and make air quotes you can make yourself believe that the spiritual or philosophical syntax behind ""The Matrix"" is also present that being the idea that the visible surface of reality conceals the true nature of power relations. But even by my standards Im stretching. Theres really no getting around the fact that this is a movie in which Channing Tatum has magic sneakers and fights lizard-men but that fundamentally is not trying to be funny. Theres a standard theory in Wachowski-ology that views the sibling duo for better or worse as something close to pure artists sealed off from critical opinion or commercial considerations who make exactly the movies they want to make and dont care what anyone thinks. Theres an appealing romance to that conception and it helps account for what went wrong (and right) with ""Cloud Atlas."" But ""Jupiter Ascending"" does not support that theory. It has big stars and elaborate special effects and feels like a failed effort to channel the specific quality of Wachowski craziness back toward the pleasure matrix of the mass audience. Its a botched truncated and possibly unfinished film that began with big dreams and got dragged down by leaden commercial reality -- a trilogys worth of space opera crammed into one movie and then abandoned on a frozen February weekend to be squashed by SpongeBob. Dont let anybody tell you its one of the worst movies of the year or whatever because that wont remotely be true. But even the flashes of possibility in ""Jupiter Ascending"" the myriad moments when it almost connects with its Platonic higher self only heighten the sense of regret. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Posted February 6 2015 -- 1020 AM EST Mila Kunis plays a young woman with the great comic book name Jupiter Jones who leads an ordinary life cleaning toilets in Chicago. Thats until a band of evil homunculus aliens attempt to murder her while shes in gynecologist stirrups. In bursts Caine Wise (Channing Tatum) an intergalactic wolfman in hover-boots pointy ears and a blond goatee. ""I have more in common with a dog than with you"" he says after rescuing her. Kunis is an actress most capable of spouting off a joke and doesnt skip a beat before exclaiming ""I love dogs"" That line is one of a few in the Wachowskis latest misfire (made for a gargantuan 175 million and delayed since last summer) that receive a big non-condescending laugh from the audience. At two hours and seven minutes Jupiter Ascending is actually the directors shortest movie since their 1996 debut the imaginative crime noir Bound and more than any of their work in between (three Matrix movies Speed Racer Cloud Atlas) it edges towards that films saucy self-aware tone. But Jupiter Ascendings early cleverness dries up quickly especially when Kunis is offscreen leaving us with just another incoherent sci-fi spectacle. At least the Wachowskis know how to fill the screen. Shot by Braveheart cinematographer John Toll the movie displays its visual gusto early with a dazzling dogfight over downtown Chicago. A disorienting device is used with palpable throttle in which the perspective is reversed so that we see the characters as stationary it seems as skyscrapers and Lake Michigan spin dizzily all around them. Later the sight of large spaceships needling into and out of the eye of Jupiter (to the squeals of composer Michael Giacchinos score) has a florid majesty that lends a pulpy 1980s feel. But thats before we see who lives in the eye of Jupiter. Its current Best Actor nominee--frontrunner even--Eddie Redmayne (The Theory of Everything) as the owner of a rusty old refinery where human beings are turned into replenishing bath water. Insanely Redmayne is presented as a formidable villain shouting lines like ""I create life"" followed in a growly whisper with ""And I destroy it."" Hes impossible to take seriously as dangerous but too mechanical to enjoy as camp. Jupiter Ascending wont have any impact on Redmaynes career or his Oscar chances but the same cant be said for his directors. Perhaps the movies underperformance--miracles notwithstanding its not predicted to earn back its budget--will have the good effect of bringing the undoubtedly talented Wachowskis back down to Earth.

Brad Wheeler The Globe and Mail Published Friday Feb. 06 2015 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Feb. 06 2015 1200AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Lana Wachowski Andy Wachowski Written by Lana Wachowski Andy Wachowski Starring Mila Kunis Channing Tatum Eddie Redmayne Classification PG Country USA Language English In the 2012 hostage caper Argo Iranian officials are fed a CIA-hatched scheme about the making of an outlandish sci-fi epic. They buy it - hook line and Ben Afflecks beard.But about Jupiter Ascending a beautiful muddle from The Matrix-making Wachowski siblings. Its about unlikely rises a flying dog-man quasi-eternal humans royal galactic rivalry lizard henchmen laser battles spaceships and an attractive Russian cleaning lady. If the unlikely script were pitched to the Persians during the hostage crisis the Ayatollahs goons would have been hip to the ruse catching on well before the ""and its in 3-D"" clincher. Video Video Mila Kunis shows off post-baby body at Jupiter Ascending premiere Canadian Ramp;B singer The Weeknd creates sparks on the ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" soundtrack and code-breakers have a new puzzle in the music video of a French DJ. Canadian Press reporter David Friend tracks the latest in entertainment. CP Video Video Video Next Big Thing A look at seductive tracks from Fifty Shades of Grey Then again Warner Bros. bought it and maybe you will too (especially if youre young and even if youre skeptical as to Mila Kuniss ability to carry a space-opera of this 175-million size). I can tell you that the space-film scenesters - shout out to the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada - were in attendance at an early screening of the film. Big applause at the end - over the moon one might say.The prologue involves a young Russian peering at the stars and possibilities with his telescope. ""The sky is completely full of miracles"" he tells his very pregnant wife. Theyve decided the child will be called ""Jupiter"" named after the ""biggest and most beautiful"" planet. Sadly a home invasion leaves the husband dead. The mother emigrates with the baby girl coming into being in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean ""born without a country a home or a father."" Fast forward to Chicago where years later Jupiter cleans the houses of the elite. Each working day she wakes up at 445 a.m.; she hates her life.As you might guess from the title however you cant keep a good Jupiter Jones down. Portrayed by the watchable but uncomplicated Kunis Jupiter is a toilet-washing Cinderella blessed with a majestic arrangement of genes. Specifically she happens to be a genetic ""reoccurrence"" of the deceased queen of a technologically advanced race and mother of the universes three overlord siblings.Theyre quite a brood all up to varying degrees of no good. Their inheritances involved planets such as Earth which are used for the harvest of its beings. The galactic royals trade in a sort of youth serum; they live for millennia. They are untrusting and untrustable and their level of conspiracy gorgeousness and evolution makes the British Royal Family look like a pack of corgis in comparison.The films antagonist is the eldest royal sibling played to near-camp effect by Eddie Redmayne. He talks in a measured menacing whisper sucking on each word as if he doesnt want to let it go. Maybe hes not acting. The young adult-y script has a milky way to it with a convoluted plot clear to only those who can channel Stephen Hawking with as much ease as the Oscar-nominated Redmayne.Basically the earthling girl Jupiter is the key. Because shes a genetic repeat of the late queen she earns the title of Her Majesty and is willed planet Earth which will be ""harvested"" soon enough.Everybody is after her but the one who catches her the most is Channing Tatums Caine Wise character. He is a former space legionnaire who has a splicing of dog genes that served him well until he bit someone. Bad dog-man He seeks redemption by protecting the sought-after Jupiter and dearly hopes to earn back the prosthetic wings that were stripped from him.Tatum even with Doberman ears and jutting pooch jaw is hunky dog-loyal and brooding enough to be attractive to the unlucky-in-love Jupiter. You can take the Kunis out of the rom-com but...The able Caines main talent is anti-gravitation He wears boots that allow him to skate on thin air. Going down is easy according to Caine going up is trickier. And really Jupiter Ascending is all about the drag of gravity and grasping of stars that seem in reach. Its the Wachowski interstellar screed against greed - time is the ultimate resource; the anti-aging serum is the currency of the elite - and societal pyramids.In the end Jupiter is uncomfortable with her ascension. She longs to return home to her simple squabbling family in Chicago. Not everyone has the royal jelly and we neednt look further than Kunis to know. Shes a likable actress but one seemingly unfit for majestic roles like this. Jupiter stays put mostly because of her.

In this one theyre buried in a barrage of Skittles. Its Star Wars-meets-Cinderella (a young woman who works cleaning toilets is told by a hunky space hero that shes actually Queen of the Universe) with the kind of chase scenes that might have happened if 2008s Speed Racer had left the ground. And it borrows - albeit with a lighter touch - the Matrixs depressing conceit that were all basically livestock living an illusion with reality withheld from us by utterly alien masters. Youd really have to slow down the movie on your PVR to absorb the subtext properly though. In a tidy two hours Jupiter Ascending does its best to imitate big dumb sci-fi entertainment with dizzying and lengthy 3D chase scenes - one of which wreaks havoc on Chicago in the actual orange backlighting of daybreak. Its a nicely-shot scene of senseless destruction on par with The Avengers demolition of New York. Mobile users click this link If youre not sharing the serial-film-esque in-joke though all youll see are action sequences sandwiched between snide alien villains with cardboard dialogue. Worse theyre pursuing a callous business-like alien agenda that results in repeated attempts to get Mila Kunis character Jupiter Jones to officially sign away or marry away her royal status and claim to Earth (extraterrestrial legalese that brings to mind the trade talks in The Phantom Menace). I will say though few people could pull off pointy ears like Channing Tatum does as the wolf-DNA-imbued bounty hunter Caine. The movie opens with a bit of backstory that explains the mundane life of Jupiter a young Russian emigre living with an extended family whose income seems to depend entirely on the cleaning income of its women. By accident Jupiter discovers that shes being tracked by ugly often-invisible little aliens with apparent bad intent. Things are about to come to a head when her hero Caine swoops in carrying her off on gravity-powered sneakers that are the niftiest action contrivance in the movie. Caine and his mentor Stinger (Sean Bean) are obliged to protect Jupiter. Others are intent on killing her. The movies prime directive is to get her off Earth by the noisiest scariest means necessary to seek explanations. Ah the explanation. Dont you hate when you meet extraterrestrials for the first time and its as if they spliced together the DNA of the Trumps and Kardashians? Earths fate it seems is a family legacy of the House of Abrasax a trio of space siblings that includes the effetely-noble Titus (Douglas Booth) the scheming Kalique (Tuppence Middleton) and the snidest-of-them-all the evil Balem (Eddie Redmayne). This is ""space opera"" in the retro over-the-top sense. (all Redmaynes missing is a sinister moustache to twirl) although the film feels like it cant quite leave all seriousness behind. In between the Wachowskis squeeze a love story between Jupiter and Caine making this nothing if not the busiest sci-fi adventure of the year. The broadness of the acting makes it hard to judge but Kunis without being physically intimidating does manage to capture the camera presence-wise. A grab-bag of things Wachowski Jupiter Ascending is short of anything new. On its own terms its an entertaining action film that doesnt overstay its welcome. But its less than we expected.

"Review Jupiter Ascendings cool worlds sink on Wachowskis weak plot - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Jupiter Ascendings cool worlds sink on Wachowskis weak plot Jupiter Ascending Movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews Jupiter Ascending starring Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews Jupiter Ascending starring Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter The Wachowskis create more striking worlds in Jupiter Ascending but their words really need help latimes The secret of the Wachowski siblings success as well as their lamentable weaknesses are both on display in their newest venture ""Jupiter Ascending.""If you ever wondered why these filmmakers were given 175 million to play with after less-than-stellar results with both ""Cloud Atlas"" and ""Speed Racer"" you will find some answers here. Simply put the Wachowskis have discovered a kind of cinematic fountain of youth They are eternally 14 years old an age that the Hollywood studio system as currently configured finds endlessly seductive.On the plus side these writers-directors responsible as well for the excellent ""The Matrix"" and its less impressive sequels certainly know how to give audiences something eye-catching to see both on this planet and others. Using the talents of production designer Hugh Bateup visual effects supervisor Dan Glass and cinematographer John Toll ""Jupiter Ascending"" deposits stars Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum in eye-widening imaginary worlds as well as in super-elaborate battles to the death in the air space above a blissfully unaware Chicago. Its in the plotting of ""Jupiter Ascending"" that things begin to fall apart. While the core idea is sound -- Kunis plays an impoverished Chicago house cleaner named Jupiter Jones a specialist in scrubbing toilets (in 3-D no less) who turns out to be the intergalactic heir to unimaginable wealth and power -- the specifics are not worked out as well as they might be.For one thing the plot details feel more than usually derivative with numerous echoes of everything from H. Rider Haggards ""She"" to ""Star Wars"" to the Wachowskis own ""Matrix"" mythology. Also the universe that the writers-directors have created is so numbingly complex that keeping track of what is going on can cause headaches. Toll was if anything understating the case when he told American Cinematographer magazine that ""the story doesnt lend itself to an easy one-line description."" Trailer Jupiter Ascending | Feb. 6 A housecleaner has her life turned upside down when she is saved from bounty hunters by a genetically engineered ex-military warrior and learns she is intergalactic royalty. With Channing Tatum Mila Kunis Sean Bean and Eddie Redmayne. A housecleaner has her life turned upside down when she is saved from bounty hunters by a genetically engineered ex-military warrior and learns she is intergalactic royalty. With Channing Tatum Mila Kunis Sean Bean and Eddie Redmayne. See more videos But the core problem with ""Jupiter Ascending"" is its language. The Wachowskis may be fine creators of soaring universes but their dialogue couldnt be more pedestrian filled with thumping cliches delivered without a trace of irony. Maybe lines like ""some lives will always matter more than others"" and ""were not getting off this planet without a fight"" will play well in dubbed versions overseas but in English they are troubling to experience. Some actors are hurt more by this feeble dialogue than others (Oscar-nominated Eddie Redmayne is especially undermined in a key supporting role) but stars Kunis and Tatum are good sports about it all gamely rolling with the punches.""Jupiter"" is at its weakest in its opening prologue which shows the St. Petersburg Russia meet cute of the title characters parents and how circumstances brought Jupiter and her mom to their life of drudgery in the City of Big Shoulders.Meanwhile on another planet way far away three siblings are living a very different kind of existence. Balem (Redmayne) Kalique (Tuppence Middleton) and Titus (Douglas Booth) are members of the Abrasax clan more or less de facto owners of the universe. Now that their mother is dead theyre making plans to divide up her empire.A key part of that domain is apparently our clueless planet Earth where ruthless bounty hunters soon appear eager to capture Jupiter for reasons she does not know and has difficulty comprehending once she finds out.Coming to her rescue is Caine Wise (Tatum) a former intergalactic soldier who -- can you believe it? -- has wolf DNA spliced into his human makeup making him ""fearless relentless a perfect hunting machine."" Once Jupiters position as ""entitled"" royalty is revealed a variant of the venerable ""you think a princess and a guy like me"" plot kicks in as well. Its all more wooden than you can imagine.""Jupiter Ascending"" is best during its purely visual moments of which there are many with a reported 2700 effects shots running the gamut from the snarling exploits of Greeghan a 7-foot tall CG lizard with wings and a tail to that above-Chicago battle which took months of planning to pull off as well as striking images that are grounded in real-world locations like Londons Natural History Museum and Ely Cathedral in Cambridgeshire.All of which makes it a shame that the only sense the Wachowskis can count on is their visual one. As the plot unravels and the dialogue disintegrates even Jupiter Jones has to ask ""How much weirder can this get?""

Photo Murray Close MOVIE REVIEW Jupiter Ascending Running time 126 minutes. Rated PG-13 (sci-fi violence partial nudity). An instant candidate for the so-bad-its-sort-of-great hall of fame ""Jupiter Ascending is totally bonkers a sort of black-velvet-Elvis mash-up of ""Star Wars and every other sci-fi/fantasy movie of the past half-century right up to ""The Hunger Games."" Look theres Mila Kunis as another chosen one spending 10 percent of the movie cleaning toilets A shirtless Channing Tatum in Mr. Spock ears trying to pretend he doesnt love Kunis And poor Eddie Redmayne -- up for Best Actor for ""The Theory of Everything"" -- flamboyantly camping it up (oops Oscar voting begins Friday) as an intergalactic real estate mogul-cum-mass murderer bent on marrying a clone of his mother. Lana and Andy Wachowskis nutty ""original plot -- I quit counting the homages to other films after passing the 50 mark -- is borderline incomprehensible but that hardly matters in a movie so jaw-droppingly awful that you cant wait to see what happens next (and that was without the use of mood-altering substances on my part). Mila Kunis as Jupiter JonesPhoto Murray Close This is the sort of movie where Tatums part-canine protector of the chosen one -- whom he always addresses as ""Your Majesty -- says stuff like ""I have more in common with a dog than you and ""Were not getting off this planet without a fight"" Still Tatum comes off better than Redmaynes 14000-year-old cross between Donald Trump and Sweeney Todd who has to keep a straight face while whispering non sequiturs like ""My mother never cleaned a toilet in her life (This is said while also ordering around his minions at the top of his lungs.) The toilet-cleaning speech comes while Redmaynes proposing marriage to Kunis the chosen one a poor Russian immigrant hes had abducted to his far far-away galaxy because shes a genetic copy of his murdered mother -- and thus somehow the rightful heir to her throne. And if he doesnt marry her one of his siblings will gain ownership of thousands of planets including Earth. Eddie Redmayne as Balem AbrasaxPhoto Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures Got that? I havent even gotten to the part about ""harvesting the populations of those planets to provide the royal family with eternal youth (they sure have easier ways in real-life Hollywood). Or a bizarre 10-minute sequence designed to illustrate the Wachowskis revelation that ""bees are genetically designed to sense royalty."" Literally no movie is safe from the Wachowskis plundering which manages to quote both ""Brazil and the Harry Potter series (among others) in the most amusing interlude where Kunis tries to get her claim to the throne validated at a retro-futuristic version of a DMV office. Their last film -- the ambitious gender-bending and centuries-spanning D.W. Griffith-on-LSD ""Cloud Atlas -- didnt hang together as a narrative either but at least nobody could accuse the Wachowskis of rummaging through the recycling bin for ideas from the likes of David Lynchs ""Dune and their own ""Matrix trilogy. This also extends to the new films deja-vu-inducing visuals which are often less than meets the eye. Still you wont be bored by ""Jupiter Ascending and Kunis somehow manages to survive with her dignity intact. Not so Redmayne and Tatum -- its giving away nothing to reveal that the latters fate is basically cribbed from ""Its a Wonderful Life. Or possibly ""Wings of Desire.""

Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The 25 best science fiction movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide The long-delayed 3-D ""Jupiter Ascending"" the new sci-fi extravaganza from the Wachowskis has finally entered Earths orbit. Its one of the more nutty futuristic escapades Ive ever seen although thats not quite the same thing as saying I liked it. Mila Kunis plays Jupiter Jones who lives out her meager existence in Chicago cleaning other peoples homes. It turns out - long story - that she is actually the Queen of the Universe. Or something like that.Her purported royalty doesnt really faze her. Shed just as soon people didnt call her ""Your Majesty"" unless maybe its Caine the hunky genetically engineered intergalactic hunter played by Channing Tatum in major mumbly mode. Caine has a slight strain of wolf DNA though hes far from a Wolverine. Zooming around the space-time continuum hes more like the Silver Surfer. Caine is Jupiters protector from the depredations of the Abrasax family headed by Eddie Redmaynes ruthless Balem who speaks in oozingly soft tones for that extra-special creepola effect. Recommended The 25 best science fiction movies of all time I enjoyed this movie more than the last two films from the Wachowskis the interminable ""Cloud Atlas"" and ""Speed Racer."" On the other hand ""The Matrix"" its not. Grade C (Rated PG-13 for some violence sequences of sci-fi action some suggestive content and partial nudity.)

"Jupiter Ascending descends rapidly review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesJupiter Ascending descends rapidly reviewMila Kunis and Channing Tatum dodge rapacious space aliens in Jupiter Ascending the cheesy new sci-fi fantasy by Andy and Lana Wachowski.Mila Kunis gets a lift from Channing Tatum in Jupiter Ascending.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Feb. 5 2015Jupiter AscendingStarring Mila Kunis Channing Tatum Eddie Redmayne Sean Bean Douglas Booth and Tuppence Middleton. Written and directed by Andy and Lana Wachowski. At GTA theatres. 127 minutes. PGFar be it from me to call Andy and Lana Wachowski crazy although a well-known definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different outcome each time.With Jupiter Ascending their latest and far from greatest sci-fi fantasy the siblings do exactly that. They laboriously return yet again to the pet theme of Earthlings being kibble for smugly snacking supernatural entities.Article Continued BelowNot satisfied with having explored such ravenings in all three films of The Matrix Trilogy and the Neo Seoul chapter of Cloud Atlas theyre back to perusing the same infernal bill of fare vainly hoping for inspiration.They dont find it. Watching Jupiter Ascending is like reading a menu of genre munchies at a drive-thru ""B"" movie burger stand. On offer is everything from accidental royalty to vengeful cruelty to interstellar insanity with an interspecies romance thrown in as the combo meal prize.The film is titled for Mila Kunis Jupiter Jones an unhappy Chicago chambermaid of Russian immigrant stock who is suddenly elevated to the status of intergalactic sovereign. Its technically a huge improvement from scrubbing toilets were it not for the kidnapping and threat of global genocide that goes along with it.Jupiters DNA matches that of the recently deceased matriarch of the House of Abrasax an evil intergalactic corporation and family dynasty. Mamas sudden demise has her children Balem (Eddie Redmayne) Titus (Douglas Booth) and Kalique (Tuppence Middleton) fighting over terms of her will. The latter includes ownership of and snacking rights to dear ol Earth which the family ""seeded"" long ago and plans to soon ""harvest"" yummy. Jupiters very existence threatens these plans since shes now first in line for the throne and not the one shes been scrubbing.As excited as I was to think these astral inheritors are worshippers of my favourite Santana album -- alas theyre Abrasax the LP is Abraxas -- this posse actually owes more to the squabbling Cullen clan of the Twilight vampire series which may be more to the point or maybe the menu.Assisting Jupiter in love and adventure is Channing Tatums Caine Wise a hybrid of man and wolf whose reputation as an ex-military hunter is hard to fathom when you take a good look at him. With his pointy Mr. Spock ears and antigravity boots he looks like the sprite from the Interflora flower delivery service rather than a fearsome warrior. Is it possible his prey snickered itself to death?Tatums most awesome acting feat may lie in his ability to maintain a straight face throughout this oh-so-serious movie. He does this while mouthing some of the most risible dialogue in recent memory. Such as when he explains to Jupiter why he cant respond in a manly fashion to her come-hither looks ""I have more in common with a dog than I have with you."" To which Jupiter naturally replies ""I love dogs""There will of course be complications before these two are both baying at the moon together and heres where Jupiter Ascending turns into more of a mystery than an adventure. There are multiple puzzles to chew over.Why is it that the Wachowskis increasingly lard their films with a surfeit of characters requiring them to bring the action to a grinding halt while everyone and everything gets splained? Jupiter is being pursued by what feels like every last neer-do-well from the Star Wars cantina. Among them are naked space aliens cyberpunk bounty hunters giant talking lizards and what looks like an entire team of masked Mexican luchador wrestlers who maybe took a wrong turn at El Paso.How is it that the two siblings who created the essence of lean and cool sci-fi with The Matrix in 1999 now take the kitchen-sink approach to their work tossing in every baroque spaceship and costumed dandy they can think of? Theyre still working with many of their Matrix crew including special effects guys Dan Glass and John Gaeta so what gives?Why is it that the more the Wachowskis unleash their imaginations the more their thoughts turn to cheese?And finally did Eddie Redmayne really think it through when he signed on for both this gig and his Oscar-nominated role in The Theory of Everything? Hed better hope Academy voters dont get a gander at his over-the-top galactic despot performance here when theyre considering whether to honour his nuanced portrayal of Stephen Hawking for which hes the odds-on favourite to win Best Actor at the Feb. 22 Oscarcast.Redmayne is lucky that Jupiter Ascending was shifted from its original July 2014 release date until now or else hed surely also be in line for the Worst Actor prize at the Razzies.But theres always next year for that and hopefully by then the Wachowskis will have found either fresher ideas or alternate employment.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

This took some doing on the part of the distributors. The opening was originally set for last summer but it was pushed back more than half a year either because as widely reported the film wasnt ready to be released or because the planet wasnt yet in its proper place.

Warner Bros. Picture hide caption toggle caption Warner Bros. Picture Mila Kunis plays Jupiter Jones a woman born on Earth who is destined for a greater life in the cosmos. Warner Bros. Picture Andy and Lana Wachowski have a rare ambition for big-budget filmmakers matched only by their consistent inability to follow through with it. The siblings squeeze gigantic philosophies and mythologies into the toothpaste tube of mass-appeal sci-fi and more often than not they make a mess. Following their exhilarating The Matrix its two moribund sequels and a fun screenwriting job on V For Vendetta the duo made Speed Racer a childrens fable that contorted flesh-and-blood actors into the neon hyperspace of Japanese anime. Then with co-director Tom Tykwer they mounted a gloriously misguided adaptation of David Mitchells Russian-doll novel Cloud Atlas that felt like a three-hour game of Guess Who Your Favorite Respected Actor Is Playing Now. What the Wachowskis last two films shared apart from terrible box office returns was a willingness to disregard common sense in the name of something strange grand and never before attempted. The movies werent good exactly but no one would claim they didnt try. Jupiter Ascending the Wachowskis latest puts lavish production design to work on a dry needlessly dense script horribly stilted attempts at romance and humor and characters who offer the bare amount of emotion necessary to qualify as sympathetic. Its not bad in that fascinating Wachowskian way -- its bad in the same way as most bad sci-fi. Like The Matrix Jupiter posits that Earth is being secretly observed by superior beings who harvest humans like cattle and can disturb the fabric of civilization without anyone knowing. A godlike dynasty of aliens who only look like humans achieves immortality by sucking up the lifeforce of entire planets and the Blue Marble is the next in line. The Neo figure is Jupiter Jones (a bewildered-looking Mila Kunis) the daughter of Russian immigrants. Jupiter works as a maid with her broadly drawn working-class foreigner family until she discovers that shes actually reincarnated space royalty. Soon her twin realities bleed into each other with a firefight among Chicagos skylines that the aliens can instantly repair before anyone notices. And she didnt even need hacking skills. Now its all aboard the Starship Exposition. Turns out Earth is part of Jupiters genetic space inheritance from the alien Abrasax clan at least one of whom appears to live in a city inside the heros namesake planet. As with all matters of inheritance things get nasty among the heirs. The three godlike Abrasax siblings -- played in ascending order of hamminess by Tuppence Middleton Douglas Booth and Oscar nominee Eddie Redmayne -- each want to claim the valuable planet for themselves so that they can destroy whats on it. Yes theyd love to share their reasons thanks for asking. Channing Tatum is clad in eyeshadow and pointy wolf ears and rocking some fly antigravity boots to distract from his monotone performance. Hes a ""splice"" agent whos here to help. Just dont ask him about his tortured pa-- oh too late. Jupiter Ascending is often so ridiculous that it feels like a reverse-engineered Lego Movie parody or Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode as though the Wachowskis started with the things everyone laughs at and worked backwards. How else to explain the scene where the cackling villain ejects a good guy into space but within arms reach of emergency spacesuits? The image of a colony of bees buzzing around Jupiters head punctuated by the explanation that bees are ""genetically designed to recognize royalty""? Or the climactic wedding showdown that ends in an abrupt cutaway? Redmayne at least seems to be enjoying himself from his spaceships infinity pool clad in regal shower curtains and alternating between a quiet royal rasp and full-throated bellows. In creating their original interplanetary wonderland the production team has evoked some questionable sources. Look at the walking talking man-lizards who wandered over from the 1993 Super Mario Bros. movie and the ornate yet barely used palaces of 1984s much-maligned Dune. A space-bureaucracy gag sequence seems lifted wholesale from the worst scene in 2005s mostly harmless The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy. This is a universe away from The Matrix still the last time a Wachowski effort fired on all cylinders. Jupiter has ascended somewhere else to the canon of unintentional sci-fi silliness.

Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis go for a spin in Jupiter Ascending Jupiter Ascending    (out of five) Directors Andy Wachowski and Lana Wachowski Cast Channing Tatum Mila Kunis Eddie Redmayne Rated PG-13 (violence sci-fi action suggestive content partial nudity) Running time 127 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 401pm on Thursday Feb. 05 2015 Thursday Feb. 05 2015 Friday Feb. 06 2015 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram The sibling writing-directing duo known as the Wachowskis were the titans of cool when they made Bound and The Matrix in the 90s . In a better universe if you looked up the word ""awesome"" in a 1999 dictionary their picture would be there. The trouble is theyve been coasting on that cool ever since. Now they are officially running on empty with Jupiter Ascending a tedious nonsensical if occasionally visually impressive sci-fi mash-up that does manage to answer one burning question What would Channing Tatum look like if he had Spocks ears?Mila Kunis is Jupiter Jones (yes really) a girl born aboard a ramshackle ship on the Atlantic after her amateur-astronomer Russian dad is killed in a robbery and her pregnant mom flees the mother country. Reared by Chicago relatives Jupiter earns her keep by helping out with the family business housecleaning.Jupiter wont be scrubbing toilets for long though. In reality shes a wanted woman because our galactic overlords -- a ruthless warring troika of siblings headed by brother Balem (Eddie Redmayne) -- are in need of her presence. It seems shes of royal lineage and really shouldnt be reduced to a common world of dirty pans and dishpan hands.Caine (a miscast Tatum) is a ""hunter"" and ""skyjacker"" a sort of human whose DNA has been spliced with that of a wolf (hence the ears) who has been hired by Balems brother Titus (Douglas Booth) to find her first.From there the plot teeters into complete absurdity involving a war within our royal family Jupiter getting to wear a really rockin wedding dress and Redmayne turning in a performance so unintentionally comic that it may force him to return his recently won Golden Globe. And poor poor Gugu Mbatha-Raw so celebrated in Belle and Beyond the Lights now reduced to wearing what look like giant mouse ears.Oh and Jupiter and Caine fall for each other even though hes damaged goods having had his wings (yes wings) forcibly removed. He can still fly with the greatest of ease though thanks to his rocket boots (dont ask). What time Andy and Lana Wachowski didnt spend on the script they invested in the visuals (that reported 175 million budget had to go somewhere). When the keepers skeletal demonic creatures in Balems employ first make an appearance to drag Jupiter from Earth they are genuinely a frightening specter. And the strange worlds of our supposed superiors -- a blend of Egypto-Roman decadence and 19th-century steampunk gadgetry -- make for some sweet eye candy. Still as with most films the 3-D is entirely extraneous.As good as it looks that is not nearly enough to rescue Jupiter Ascending the first original film by the Wachowskis since the ""Matrix"" trilogy. ( Speed Racer and Cloud Atlas were based on pre-existing material.) It has been preceded by bad word-of-mouth no doubt spurred by Warner Bros. moving the long-gestating film from its original release date last summer to the no-mans-land of early February. A surprise screening at Sundance in late January was met with indifference (though to be fair Sundance is hardly the crowd for sci-fi action-adventure). For the sake of Neo Morpheus the red pill the blue pill and the rest of The Matrix it would be great to report that the negativity was wrong that the Wachowskis indeed got their groove back. But the only groove theyre going to see is the one on multiplex floors as moviegoers stampede the exits.

Photo Murray Close / McClatchy-Tribune News Service Jupiter Ascending review An unearthly display of sci-fi skill 1 / 6 Back to Gallery Almost every movie about the future is really about the present. In ""Star Trek"" the universe of competing powers -- the Federation versus the Romulans and Klingons -- was really just a blown-out version of the Cold War with NATO pitted against China and the Soviet Union. Nearly 50 years later Andy and Lana Wachowski make entertainment out of a host of modern anxieties in ""Jupiter Ascending"" envisioning a future universe in which a handful of elites control technology and can live indefinitely. Meanwhile the great masses of people live short manipulated lives of meaninglessness and doom. ""Jupiter Ascending"" is a film very much of its moment in ways both good and bad. But the important thing is that its virtues are extraordinary while its flaws are easy to forget because theyre so common. Many of the action sequences showing various spacecraft descending into cities to fly between buildings are dull and not well choreographed. Watching them is like staring at a big computer screen. How many times have you heard that? But the Wachowskis must be given credit for being smart and for creating out of their byzantine ruminations on existence something thats mostly fun to watch. Anyone who believes in conspiracies or wonders about other dimensions or loves technology or is freaked out by technology or questions what we call reality or wonders how the world got started will find evidence in ""Jupiter Ascending"" that the Wachowskis have been thinking about all that too. But theyve been thinking longer and better. It may take more than one viewing to understand the whole setup but the essential thing to know is that there is a young scrub woman in Chicago Jupiter (Mila Kunis) who gets up every morning at 445 a.m. to make beds and clean toilets. She seems like an average person but in fact there is a powerful entity on the other side of the universe who absolutely wants her dead. This is something else great about the Wachowskis They know everyone will identify with this because they understand the insane combination of boundless paranoia and grandiosity that is within every human being. Soon creepy little guys -- the evil cousins of the ""Close Encounters"" aliens -- show up to kill her but she is rescued by Caine (Channing Tatum) who is half wolf and half man. The man part makes him feasible and the wolf part makes him dangerous so hes ideal boyfriend material. In ""Jupiter Ascending"" the Wachowskis provide the audience with information on a need-to-know basis so to describe what follows is to impart more understanding than the viewer should have. Suffice it to say Caine is working for powerful entities and Jupiters task almost from start to finish is to navigate the politics and shifts in a universe she barely understands. The first hint that ""Jupiter Ascending"" is something more than ""John Carter"" with star appeal is a long conversation between Jupiter and Kalique (Tuppence Middleton) a member of the universes ruling family. Kalique a cheerful woman with a motherly appeal lays out the joys and possibilities of living in this new world. Her description is genuinely seductive. Yet implicit in everything she says is a blithe underlying cruelty. Eddie Redmayne as the most ambitious of the ruling elite almost qualifies on his own as a reason to see the movie. He plays a neurasthenic monster a cousin to every Caligula who has ever chewed the scenery and his mode is to speak in a breathy mumble and then occasionally just scream out of nowhere. In a way its an amazingly horrible performance an example of what can happen when an easy-going young actor makes the mistake of doing whatever his directors tell him. Going into the Oscar vote in which Redmayne is Michael Keatons chief competitor Keaton really should be sending the Wachowskis a fruit basket. Perhaps flowers too but at minimum a basket with nice pears different kinds of apples and maybe a pineapple. Yet heres the thing If Redmayne were truly horrible in ""Jupiter Ascending"" why is he one of the most enjoyable things about it? As charming as Kunis is -- she has a wit and comic timing that reminds me a little of Carole Lombard -- people will be walking out of the movie talking about Redmayne and no one will be sorry they saw him. And few will be sorry to have seen ""Jupiter Ascending."" The Wachowskis have devised a compelling universe and if they want to continue exploring it for a sequel or two well for once thats probably a good idea.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Stephanie Merry February 5 2015 Follow stephmerry The world of ""Jupiter Ascending"" is bursting with vivid details wolf-man hybrids and flying lizard warriors invisible spaceships and volcanic kingdoms. The Wachowski siblings the writing-and-directing team behind the ""Matrix"" movies have conjured another universe from scratch. For most of us colorful flights of fancy have gone the way of imaginary friends -- the older we get the more our creative impulses get drowned out by the cacophony of adult responsibilities. It seems that Andy and Lana Wachowski have never lost that childlike ability to dream. But they also havent mastered the grown-up power to rein it in. The story they tell in ""Jupiter Ascending"" could probably occupy an entire television season. Theres way too much here for one movie to hold. Mila Kunis plays Jupiter Jones the daughter of immigrants working as a maid in Chicago and sharing a bedroom with her mother and aunt. Its a humble existence especially considering shes a queen at least to the people who live on far-off planets that we Earthlings have never heard of. There are pros and cons to having royal genes. Jupiter is heir to a huge fortune but some people want her dead. Luckily Caine (Channing Tatum) appears and ends up rescuing her from evildoers and explaining the cosmos. Hes a ""splice"" -- part-wolf part-man -- and 100 percent melancholy dreamboat. Caine is a former intergalactic crime fighter and he skates around town on gravity-defying shoes. GMOs never looked so good. It turns out that Earth is Jupiters birthright. But shes going to have a hard time claiming it because a trio of siblings are determined to snatch it from her. Theyre part of the ruling Abrasax family -- the Habsburgs of the sky -- and theyre all a little off. Titus (Douglas Booth) is an orgiastic ladies man; Kalique (Tuppence Middleton) is a quietly unhinged fount of dubious wisdom. Then theres Balem played by Eddie Redmayne. He may be up for a best actor Oscar for ""The Theory of Everything"" but here hes hilariously over-the-top. He speaks in barely audible whispers attempting to drop his voice by an octave and skulks around with an emotionless far-off gaze thats supposed to read as psychotic. In truth hes about as intimidating as a toddler. His tantrums manifest themselves in sudden outbursts that have Redmayne screeching his lines. Unfortunately youll never be able to unhear the way he shrieks ""Gooooo"" to his hideous minions. The Abrasax siblings dont get along so they arent teaming up against Jupiter so much as individually going after her which turns into three separate narrative threads that take our hero to three planets. Theres simply not enough time to give any of these stories their due so instead each one feels abbreviated. Sometimes during conspicuous editing you can almost see where more movie was supposed to exist like a narrative with phantom limbs. When Jupiter meets Titus for example she falls under his spell in a matter of moments even though she has been warned about the crazed fanatics in his family. If there were more time her gullibility might be comprehensible. Instead we shake our heads at this woman who has gotten herself into yet another sticky situation from which only a wolfman with magic shoes can extricate her. Theres still time for some fun detours that further illuminate the Wachowskis spectacular visions. One wry diversion involves a robotic ""intergalactic advocate"" named Bob who ushers Jupiter through an endless bureaucracy to claim her inheritance. It makes the DMV look like Maui. And although they dont get a lot of screen time Caines legionnaire comrades are an entertaining crew. Even with all the action and adventure ""Jupiter Ascending"" often feels primarily like a love story. A relationship between Caine and Jupiter is inevitable thanks in part to her near-constant damsel-in-distress routine. But the pairing never feels entirely earned. Like everything else in the movie its too much too soon. PG-13. At area theaters. Contains violence sequences of sci-fi action some suggestive content and partial nudity. 127 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

(AP Photo/Warner Bros. Pictures Murray Close) I dont know about you but if were a house-cleaner who was kidnapped by a dog-eared Rollerblader and whisked to an alien planet to be its new queen I might have a few questions. But maybe that scene was left on the cutting-room floor before ""Jupiter Ascending"" limped into theaters several months after its planned release date.In its current incarnation this space opera by the rapidly descending Wachowskis (""The Matrix"" ""Cloud Atlas"") is a variation on ""Cinderella."" Russian immigrant Jupiter (Mila Kunis) cleans toilets in Chicago with her widowed mother and dreams of a better life the kind where she can spend 4000 on eBay for a telescope to gaze at the stars like her late father.She gets her chance to make some money when her scheming Russian cousin sells her eggs to a fertility clinic (because capitalism). But a crafty alien dynasty called the Abrasax family has been monitoring the human gene pool and when they discover that Jupiter has the DNA to inherit the throne from their late queen a hit squad is dispatched by the queens three greedy children (Eddie Redmayne as Balem Tuppence Middleton as Kalique and Douglas Booth as Titus). But Jupiter has a guardian half-human/half-dog bounty hunter Caine (Channing Tatum) who skates into action on rocket-powered shoes. Channing Tatum is a lot of things but hes not a stoic Superman like the role he plays here which is made more laughable by prosthetic pointy ears. For unintended laughs its hard to top Redmayne who utters death threats in a narcoleptic growl like Harvey Fierstein on heroin. On the receiving end of his wrath are various half-human toadies who protect the interplanetary interests of the three Abrasax kids (because yelling). But pouty-lipped prince Titus decides if you cant beat em join em and he offers Jupiter a big rock -- literally -- to marry him and consolidate their property rights. Never mind that shes sort of his mother.Her awkward overdressed entrance into the marriage arena along with an earlier scene of bureaucratic hassles at the interplanetary border suggest that ""Jupiter Ascending"" may have been planned as a Terry Gilliam-style comedic fantasy. (Indeed Gilliam has a cameo role.) But someone got cold feet and poured the money into special effects instead of script development (because foreign markets). Instead of a cinematic drag queen like the guilty pleasure ""The Fifth Element"" ""Jupiter Ascending"" is a mutant thats mostly dog.

(Warner Bros. Pictures) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday February 5 2015 230 PM Title Jupiter Ascending Film Info With Mila Kunis Channing Tatum. A galactic queen and a man-wolf save Earth. Directors Lana and Andy Wachowski (205). PG-13 Violence brief nudity. Area theaters. 3D where available. Talk about lost in space. The whacked-out outer-space melodrama ""Jupiter Ascending"" has embedded in its genes the DNA of ""Barbarella"" and ""Flash Gordon"" some dust from ""Dune"" and even a bit of Michael Jacksons Disneyland short ""Captain Eo."" Written and directed by Lana and Andy Wachowski (the ""Matrix"" films) its earnest adolescent enthusiasm is noble. But with a blunt wit misguided performances and a dull story ""Jupiter"" ends up falling down. In present-day Chicago Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) works as a house cleaner scrubbing toilets with her Russian-born mother. Named for the favorite planet of her astronomer father Jupiter -- unknown to herself or her family -- is a genetic replica of a long-dead alien matriarch of the universe. Who FYI owned Earth. When Jupiters existence becomes known to the queens evil offspring -- Kalique (Tuppence Middleton) Titus (Douglas Booth) and Balem Abrasax (Eddie Redmayne) -- they set out to find her employing Caine Wise (Channing Tatum) a warrior human whose genes were spliced with ""something like a wolf"" (he has pointy ears and a goatee). Caine scoots around on gravity-free light-beam shoes and is constantly saving Jupiter after shes whisked off to far-flung parts of the verse -- not ""universe"" since there are many verses. Theyre helped and hindered by Caines compatriot Stinger (Sean Bean). The Abrasax clan it turns out destroyed the dinosaurs and seeded the Earth with their DNA in order to utilize human cells for nefarious purposes. But Jupiter and Caine plan to stop that though if Titus blackmails Jupiter into marrying him he can own Earth. Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis cant save ""Jupiter Ascedning"" a flick that needs to be space waste. (Murray Close/Warner Bros. Pictures) Whew. Exhausted yet? We havent even mentioned the reptilian henchmen robot bureaucrats and nectar baths. Though ""Jupiter Ascending"" isnt cheap-looking it still recalls such chintzy ""Star Wars"" copycats as ""Battle Beyond the Stars"" (1980) and ""The Last Starfighter"" (1984). Yet theres something endearing about the Wachowskis joy in another eras campy sci-fi. If young moviegoers find inspiration in its excitement about world-building that counts for something. But with sharp inventive flicks like ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" out there ""Jupiters"" clunkiness is deadly. When the Wachowskis made ""The Matrix"" (1999) one of the great sci-fi parables their comic-book zeal was pure. Even the ambitious novel adaptation ""Cloud Atlas"" (2012) had a specific kind of intimacy. ""Jupiters"" bigger targets means bigger failure. Kunis whose perma-scowl is out of synch with her characters sense of awe is never given much to do. Tatum fares slightly better as her savior-bodyguard -- hes both Han Solo and Chewbacca -- but you can almost hear him saying ""WTF?"" inside his head. Yet its Redmayne a front-runner for this years Best Actor Oscar for ""The Theory of Everything"" who fares worst. His whispery villain swans around as the embodiment of the movies much-too-much approach. Hes game for it all and it costs him. Like Kunis Tatum and so many things in ""Jupiter Ascending"" Redmayne is all dressed up with nowhere to go. jneumaiernydailynews.com Follow me on TWITTER NeumaierMovies Catch ""Joe Neumaiers Movie Minute"" throughout the day Thurs. - Sun. on New Yorks WOR 710 AM and at wor710.com.

Maybe its because the Wachowskis have officially begun cannibalizing their own work. Way back in 1999 The Matrix gave us a Chosen One who gets introduced to a reality entirely beyond his experience a reality based on a terrifying premise humanity reduced to fuel. Then it was Keanu Reeves. Now its Mila Kunis. Though the actorly affect is similar the change in gender and the passage of time have not improved matters and the camp glory of blond Channing Tatum shirtlessly roller-blading through the sky doesnt make up for the midichlorianized mysticism. (Where The Matrix featured a prophecy with love at its heart Jupiter offers the ""almost spiritual"" significance of genes.) The set design and costuming are pretty fabulous though and thank goodness it gives you something to look at during the talk talk talk (which still somehow doesnt explain everything). Its a pity really an early bitchfest between three privileged siblings (including a wheezing Eddie Redmayne) promises something delicious and decadent a futuristic Roman empire in decline. Instead we get overlong chases and gunfights awkward romance between a girl and her half-dog protector and the endless wisps and ripples of technological decoration. 2015. -- Matthew Lickona This movie is not currently in theaters.

VPCJupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) is drawn into an increasingly nonsensical world.(Photo Warner Bros. Pictures via AP)Jupiter Ascending is a sharp descent for everyone involved.The sci-fi films reported 175 million budget must have gone largely into loopy production design wild costumes outlandish hairstyles and colorful make-up. It certainly didnt go into developing a coherent script or coaching believable performances (1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide).The story is laughably inane and uninvolving. The brains behind The Matrix movies Lana and Andy Wachowski are responsible for this ambitious misfire.A ridiculous intergalactic action-adventure Jupiter even draws a risible portrayal from an Oscar-nominated actor.For those who want their image of Eddie Redmayne as a consummate actor capable of a moving portrayal of Steven Hawking to remain intact stay far away from this movie. The creepy whispery voice he affects for his villainous role is one part Don Corleone one part Lord Voldemort and several parts absurdly melodramatic.Jupiter is a convoluted design-happy space opera whose special effects are underwhelming and whose story grows ever more absurd as it goes along. If nothing else the eye candy is sweet Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) is squired about by hunky and chivalrous Caine (an often shirtless Channing Tatum in guy-liner and pointy elf ears). He lands on Earth flies around in hover boots and sweeps her up into the stratosphere. His mission is to protect her from power-mad alien siblings -- Balem (Redmayne) Kalique (Tuppence Milddleton) and Titus (Douglas Booth) -- each bent on Jupiters destruction. Evidently she shares their dead mothers genetic composition and as such looms large and in charge. Jupiter has a particularly unappealing life spending most of her days cleaning toilets in Chicago. When not scrubbing porcelain she feels misunderstood by her extended Russian immigrant family. When she finds out shes heir to a vast space empire it would seem to be thrilling news. Or at least its supposed to be for us mere mortals watching the movie.Jupiter occasionally feels derivative with whiffs of Star Wars Princess Diaries Dune and even a bit of Star Trek. But when Jupiter asks of no one in particular ""Could this get any weirder?"" we echo her sentiments.Prolonged action sequences with a host of creatures including some reptilian hybrids have a video game feel. And oddly Jupiter appears to jog delicately from escalating peril rather than running full-speed ahead.After Caine sweeps Jupiter off to a farm run by beekeeper Stinger (Sean Bean) everyone there begins addressing her as ""Your Majesty."" The reason for the title shes told is that the bees act differently around her. Apparently she can manipulate their swarming.""Bees are genetically designed to recognize royalty"" Stinger explains. Bean deserves an Oscar nomination for delivering that line with a straight face. Everything else about the movie is equally preposterous. Sometimes it feels like an elaborate send-up of interplanetary action movies. But thudding attempts at actual humor only make the unintentional comedy that much more odious. Jupiter spends some time on distant planets but misses her drab existence on Earth. So does the audience. At least that made sense.Redmayne should hope that Oscar voters give Jupiter a pass. And non-Academy members would also do well to keep their distance from this garish but dreary mess. 42 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1D2yZQf",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/02/05/jupiter-ascending-review/22839117/,200,jupiterascending26,jupiterascending,usatoday

I heard one critic crack to another as I settled in for Jupiter Ascending. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - ""Maybe in March well see this years first good movie"" his pal said back as if Girlhood Hard to Be a God Amira amp; Sam Timbuktu Joy of Mans Desiring and The Duke of Burgundy didnt exist.Then as the lights dimmed they complained that the studios dont invite critics to as many big movies as they used to as if its a sensible investment for Warner Bros. to endeavor to get Jupiter Ascending in front of miserable pricks who already know they hate it.Film Details Jupiter Ascending RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time127 More Info Trailer Those particular pricks are wrong to be so from-the-start dismissive of Jupiter Ascending. The movies a fascinating mess grand and gaudy often hilarious. Wait until you see the bees of Earth decide that Mila Kunis is a queen of some sort. Or shirtless Channing Tatum with elf-ears and a goatee looking like hes playing Puck in a WWE production of A Midsummer Nights Dream. Some of its marvels are worth beholding on the biggest screen you can find An early chase/battle set against the Chicago skyline bests the Marvel movies in vigor coherence and beauty.Too bad that at that point in the movie we dont know or care really about anyone involved in that chase -- and that the action to come isnt as sharply executed. For some reason the Wachowskis are three bang-up action set pieces in before they tell us who anybody is. Still theres a simple test Ive come up with to measure the pleasures of putative blockbusters one that Jupiter Ascending however nonsensical handily passes Is watching this movie more interesting than seeing all the millions they spent on it stuffed into a woodchipper aimed at the producers faces?Yes it is. As always with the Wachowskis who directed and produced theres heaps of Big Ideas for the stoner crowd As Kuniss everyday cleaning woman gets caught up in dynastic space warfare we learn what really killed the dinosaurs where crop circles come from why some people seem truly to believe theyve suffered alien abductions and how human life originated on Earth (which is much clearer here than in Prometheus). We dont learn why the talking-lizard villains seem to believe that leather jackets look totally badass but I just figure their planet never got Happy Days.Those prick critics were right about one thing. Jupiter Ascending often suggests a video game but not always in the way critics mean when they resort to such vague shorthand. Usually critics lob ""video game"" as an insult at any movie that has lots of computer-assisted fantasy violence especially if the filmmakers stage and shoot and cut it without honoring the limitations of the older movie-tech those critics grew up on. If actors are zipping around in the sky and the audience seems to follow right along with them and its obvious that this could never have been whipped up on a set with some dolly tracks then for many critics it doesnt count Its not how God and Hitch intended movies to look. Their concern seems to be that the craft behind it is not the right kind but thats really just an excuse not to bother trying to unpack the images onscreen.I mean imagine theater critics getting huffy over a plays use of video projections.Theres a half-hour or so of Jupiter Ascending that looks like a video game in that familiar way. Playing an intergalactic wolf-man Tatum scoots through a city beneath Jupiters red spot on anti-grav rollerblades as blood-red space-towers crumble around him -- and Kunis keeps getting stranded on an improbable number of collapsing balconies. The sequence is alternately gobstopping and incomprehensible like much of the film but in one key sense its not like a video game at all. The creators of games make sure that at all times you the player know exactly what youre looking at where youre going and what dangers matter. The Wachowskis may have vision but theyre hit-or-miss with clarity -- how come sometimes Tatum can crash right into flaming debris and other times he has to dash around it in a panic?Of course theres much greater diversity among video games than there is among movie critics. The type of game the movie mostly resembles is something like Dragon Age purportedly a ""role-playing game"" but in actuality more of a fantasyland conversation simulator. In that breed of RPG the chief draw isnt the mayhem or the exploration -- its the long stiff chats between the player via an onscreen avatar and the games elves kings beasts and what-have-yous who have much to say about their world and their pasts and the way you give them boners.Perhaps that game influence accounts for Kuniss curious blankness her characters blase response to being whisked from the top of the Sears Tower and told that bees can smell her royalty. Its left to us to read into her what she wants. She asks a lot of questions in the movie and they sound as if theyve been selected by a player from a list offered up by the games creators -- and whoevers wielding the PS4 controller keeps choosing the one about the finer points of franchise lore rather than niceties like ""Im the queen of what now?"" or ""Why are those guys chasing us?"" or ""What is all this about anyway?"" or ""How come we finally have a lavish SF adventure film with a female hero but shes mostly a passive lump and then the climax centers around Tatum roller-discoing through the heavens as he tries to stop her wedding?""Thats the kind of game Jupiter Ascending is a strange and dazzling and exhausting one that would be better if you were piloting its avatar -- and asking the questions.Other weirdness I feel obliged to note the confounding comedy sequence about intergalactic bureaucracy that kicks off with a dreadfully caricatured black woman hmmphing her way through a miserable government job; the grandeur of every shot of Jupiter and its bloody-mary hurricanes; the way the elephant-trunked creature running a station on a spaceship somehow looks nothing like Max Rebo; the now objectively proven fact that talking CGI lizards never work as bad guys; portentous Wachowski dialogue like ""Life is an act of consumption"" and ""Sharing is not the strength of your species"" and ""Bees dont lie""; the too-short moment where Kuniss character considers letting immortal beings kill all life on Earth sometime in the future if it happens after she and her family have lived out their lives; the fact that Kuniss character is named Jupiter Jones just like that chunky junkyard detective kid in the Three Investigators books; the way Kuniss character just like a Dragon Age elf suddenly decides shes totally hot for a member of her party; the thousand white candles one of the villains sets out in his lair like space tyrants share Stings idea of whats classy; the fact that the other planets often look like Naboo multiplied by Rivendell; the way Tatum holding on to a spaceship as it leaves the atmosphere makes that whole Indiana Jones-somehow-clings-to-the-submarine thing look entirely reasonable; that its a relief to see so much money spent in pursuit of so reckless and goony and humane and garish a stab at greatness rather than like Iron Man 4 or something.3 Warn Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Alan Scherstuhl Follow studiesincrap Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

February 5 2015 -- 248pm Video (0234)  From the streets of Chicago to the far-flung galaxies whirling through space this film tells the story of Jupiter Jones who was born under a night sky with signs predicting she was destined for great things. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert Stay away stay away. ""Jupiter Ascending"" is a botched exercise in computer-rendered lizard men ridiculous levitation boots and dramatic inertia. While its long on explosions it lacks the best special effect of all a solid story. It was written and directed by the Wachowski siblings who earned our respect long ago with ""The Matrix"" but have become synonymous with failure ever since. If their new project is not the worst film in the galaxy it is a formidable front-runner in the race. Delivering zero prestige to Warner Bros. despite a budget of about 175 million this offensively uninteresting project proves that science fiction is a genre dying out. Once a bedrock of our film culture it has been poisoned to the point of collapse by expensive failures like ""John Carter"" ""Prometheus"" ""Cowboys and Aliens"" ""Interstellar"" and Eddie Murphys career-killing nightclub-on-the-moon disaster ""The Adventures of Pluto Nash."" But this one wins the Jar Jar Binks prize for tedious fantasy. The human focus of this warp-speed dive is Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) a toilet-scrubbing Chicago housecleaner. Her late father scanned the solar system as a telescope astronomer but his eye on the sky never noticed how interested aliens were in his offspring. Jupiter a sort of space Cinderella is part of an interstellar gene pool a genetic twin of a goddess who began the human occupation of Earth millennia ago. Her kinship to royal successors Balem (Eddie Redmayne all evil sneers and whispers) Titus (Douglas Booth aggressively pursuing her as his princess bride) and Kalique (Tuppence Middleton offering fashion tips on how to look youthful at 15000 years old) brings them to a logical conclusion -- they must eliminate her. This is all news to Jupiter who begins to suspect that something odd is in the works during an appointment to sell her eggs at a childbirth clinic. She needs the money to buy a telescope on eBay you see and ... oh never mind. At the clinic a squad of nude extraterrestrials try to slice her apart in a Mengele-style experiment but a heroic elf-eared guardian arrives on anti-gravity galoshes that let him fly through explosions and run up walls. This is Caine Wise (Channing Tatum) whose mix of human and wolf DNA makes him a cunning warrior. His often shirtless lupine look also makes him the subject of wolf whistles from Jupiter. He explains her queenly status declaring ""Your majesty I have more in common with a dog than I have with you."" She responds ""I love dogs. Ive always loved dogs."" Its hard to say which role is duller -- desperate working girl or unstoppable killing machine -- but the two arent comfortably reconciled. Warner Bros. Mila Kunis plays Jupiter Jones the genetic twin of a goddess in ""Jupiter Ascending."" Despite Wises efforts to protect her Jupiter is chased across Chicago in destructive dogfights with exhaustingly deployed rocket ships. The lack of police or military response may mirror public indifference to the film itself. Kunis plays a very passive character but her attempt to exploit the bureaucracy of space taxation to stop the planetary takeover provides the only brief passage of good entertainment an homage to Terry Gilliams futuristic classic ""Brazil"" with a charming cameo by the director himself as a civil service functionary. In a film that is a hundred battle scenes just marking time until the end credits Gilliams appearance is the only point where ""Jupiter Ascending"" escalates to amusement. Colin Covert has covered films for the Star Tribune for 20 years interviewing Peter Jackson Kate Winslet Steven Spielberg Cate Blanchett Quentin Tarantino Neil Gaiman and John Travolta to name a few. Colins job as a film critic consists mostly of thinking up synonyms for ""mediocre."" He still gets a thrill when the lights dim and all too often a bigger thrill when they come on again.

Comments click to enlarge Jupiter Ascending Video Rated PG-13  127 minutes  2015 I thought the meek were supposed to inherit the earth but in this grandiose space opera its Mila Kunis. A lowly Chicago janitor from a family of rambunctious Russian immigrants she discovers that in truth she belongs to an aristocratic line of aliens who inhabit the title planet (and all have British accents) and that shes the rightful queen of earth. Like many fantasy features by the Wachowskis (Cloud Atlas the Matrix trilogy) this is a wonder to behold full of minutely realized gadgetry but a chore to follow full of barely realized characters. The story sticks to the basic outlines of the original Star Wars with stand-ins for Princess Leia (Kunis) Han Solo (Sean Bean) Luke Skywalker (Channing Tatum as a genetic wolf boy with pointy ears) and Darth Vader (Eddie Redmayne trying out various moues and strutting around in a black leather cape). The Wachowskis hail from Chicago but have rarely shown it in their movies; I suppose the worlds they inhabit mentally make it seem even more gray. By J.R.

"Jupiter Ascending (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Jupiter Ascending (PG-13) The new sci-fi/fantasy epic by the Wachowskis continues their creative slump. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com2/5/2015 Editor rating 1 Jupiter Ascending was supposed to be Lana and Andy Wachowskis big comeback the one that brought back their mojo their mystique and their genre-bending creativity - the one that forced you to pay attention to them again. After the disappointment of the misguided Matrix sequels followed by two ambitious failures based on other peoples material (Speed Racer Cloud Atlas) the new film is the filmmakers first original stand-alone work since the first Matrix picture in 1999. The hope was was that the duo would have regrouped learned from their mistakes and cooked up another sci-fi pop masterpiece that showed us things and took us places no other film had before. (It is also their first 3D picture another element to pique our curiosity.) Maybe thats too much to expect from a mere movie but the Wachowskis are supremely gifted imaginative filmmakers who have proven they can tell a corker of a story without a single special effect (their first film Bound was a delirious sexy thriller set almost entirely inside two apartments). Sadly Jupiter Ascending turns out to be the exact opposite the worst movie the Wachowskis have ever made. The first sign of trouble came last summer when distributor Warner Bros. announced it was pushing the release of the film back seven months to February to allow more time for the elaborate special effects to be completed. This is often studio-speak for ""This turkey is going to get clobbered in the summer. Why not move it to a less crowded time of year when the competition will be less intense?"" But there was no ideal date to release this hackneyed surprisingly dull fantasy which cost a whopping 175 million to produce even though the script is worth two dollars at best (maybe a little more if you listed it on eBay). Borrowing the central premise of The Matrix -- an ordinary person is thrust into an alternate universe they didnt know existed -- Jupiter Ascending stars Mila Kunis as Jupiter Jones a Russian immigrant who scrubs toilets for a living and discovers she is the reincarnation of a 91000-year-old intergalactic queen who once ruled the universe. The late womans three children (Eddie Redmayne Douglas Booth and Tuppence Middleton) are battling amongst themselves to claim their late mothers post. Instead of King Lear though the movie evokes Keeping Up with the Kardashians the three would-be rulers pouting and plotting against each other while dressed in elegant otherworldly garb. All of them need to capture Jupiter in order to carry out their plans. Fortunately theres a Han Solo-type rogue Caine (Channing Tatum) who has cool roller-blades that float like Marty McFlys hoverboard and a transparent shield like Captain Americas that helps protect him from the bullets and laser bolts constantly flying at his head. Caine swoops down to Earth and fills in Jupiter on whats happening. This would be enough to blow anyones mind or at least make them a tiny bit nervous. But instead Jupiter seems completely unfazed responding with the sorts of questions a child would ask (""Are those flying boots?"" and ""Do you do this kind of thing a lot?"") Kunis who is normally a bright and intriguing presence onscreen seems as dazed and confused as the audience reacting to everything with the same blank-eyed look her mouth slightly agape. The actress looks like shes just trying to push through the movie without flubbing her lines and get out of there. Tatum fares better rising above the material the way he usually does although his character is so thin his name might as well have been The Good Guy. Jupiter Ascending is packed with some wondrous visuals -- no matter the movie the Wachowskis always deliver the eye candy -- but aside from a couple of strong setpieces theres surprisingly little action in the film. There are however reams of exposition (at least half of the movies screenplay is devoted to explaining what exactly is going on). Redmayne (The Theory of Everything) the meanest of the three siblings recites all his lines in a Dr. Evil whisper raising his voice only when hes really mad intending to come off as menacing. Instead he comes off as a guy with laryngitis who is fond of prancing around in caped costumes. There are some fun gee-whiz moments in Jupiter Ascending but they are fleeting and not nearly enough to make up for a movie about people fighting over chunks of outer space like homeowners bidding on a desirable property. Thematically the film is barren - a wasteland of pulpy nonsense. Terry Gilliam pops up in a brief cameo providing the picture with its sole moment of mischievous humor and making you wonder what he might have done with this material. At least the Wachowskis give us loads of with howl-worthy lines (Caine ""I have more in common with dogs than I have with you."" Jupiter ""I love dogs"") but the total loss of narrative control and momentum is troubling. Jupiter Ascending is the sort of gigantic self-indulgent mess only talented filmmakers with a good track record get to make although if the picture fails financially the Wachowskis may have to go back to their low-budget roots and come up with something simpler that showcases their storytelling talents. All Jupiter Ascending does is make you long for one of those Pirates of the Caribbean sequels which suddenly dont seem so bad any more.

But the shaky story doesnt support big ideas.Mila Kunis plays a Russian immigrant to the U.S. who learns shes actually Jovian royalty in ""Jupiter Ascending.""(Photo Warner Bros. Pictures)Story Highlights2 stars (out of 5)The Wachowskis films always will be compared with ""The Matrix."" This one comes up short.A good cast is given little of substance to do. The actors look bored and confused.No one is going to confuse Andy and Lana Wachowski with Orson Welles but the siblings face a similar struggle.The brilliant Welles spent his career trying to live up to the genius of his first film ""Citizen Kane"" a movie so inventive and influential as to be revolutionary. The Wachowskis meanwhile will always face comparisons with their second film ""The Matrix"" revolutionary in its own way with a mind-bending mix of effects and metaphysics.Welles made other great movies including ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" but never again matched his first film.The Wachowskis on the other hand are still plugging away looking for good stories to help make sense of life and existence poking around in all corners of the universe. But they keep coming up empty.""Jupiter Ascending"" their latest is no exception.Mila Kunis stars as Jupiter Jones a Russian immigrant whose father -- murdered in Russia before Jupiter was born -- predicted big things for her. But as the film begins shes working as a maid with her mother and their family in Chicago scrubbing toilets and hating her life.All this changes with the arrival of Caine Wise (Channing Tatum) a wolf-human hybrid (check out the ears) who zips in on shoes that allow him to fly saving Jupiter from bad guys she didnt even know were bad.Jupiter you see is a part of a much bigger blueprint for the universe. Earth it turns out is just a kind of farm planet. The universe is made up of many such properties valuable for different reasons. The planets are divvied up among three siblings Kalique (Tuppence Middleton) Titus (Douglas Booth) and the oldest Balem (Eddie Redmayne doubtless having no idea the movie would be delayed months and thus come out just as Oscar voters are considering his nominated performance in ""The Theory of Everything"").Related 5 things to know about Mila Kunis Because its just another property to be fought over the three have a cavalier attitude toward Earth and human life. They sound like a family of slumlords fighting over a crumbling-but-profitable tenement project.The whys and what-fors youll have to discover for yourself. You wont find spoilers here; the story which the Wachowskis co-wrote is so convoluted its incredibly difficult to understand and impossible to explain. If you figure it out let me know.The short version is that Jupiter shares DNA with the siblings mother so shes not just royalty but a kind of reincarnation. This does not prevent her newfound relatives from wanting her dead or rescued or dead again all for different reasons. Shes a pawn in their jealous games a story that has been told before but not to my knowledge on the planet Jupiter.There are some big ideas tossed about here most having to do with time. But nothing really has a chance to take hold; theres too much of a rush to get to another visually striking chase or explosion or otherworldly skyline. (Jupiter is heavily influenced by the steampunk movement from the looks of it. The planet. Not the character.)There also are a few laughs including a bit where we learn that bureaucracy is a bane no matter what planet you live on. (Look for Terry Gilliam in a cameo a sweet touch considering his classic ""Brazil"" was the last word on the dangers of bureaucracy.)But the weight of these ideas proves far too heavy for the story to support. The acting doesnt help. When the range extends from confused to bored its not a good sign. And these are good actors. Theyre just given silly things to do. Not as silly as Tom Hanks and Halle Berry muttering in the made-up gibberish created for the Wachowskis last film ""Cloud Atlas."" But theres nothing of substance the ""Jupiter"" cast can really latch onto.Redmaynes greatly affected whispering is most notable as it goes from curious to creepy to annoying all in the space of a few scenes.The Wachowskis never lack for ambition. Its in the execution where they run into trouble. Maybe they have a ""Magnificent Ambersons"" in them. Or another ""Matrix."" Lets hope so.But ""Jupiter Ascending"" is not it.Jupiter Ascending2 stars (out of 5) Directors Andy and Lana Wachowski.Cast Mila Kunis Channing Tatum Eddie Redmayne.Rating PG-13 for some violence sequences of sci-fi action some suggestive content and partial nudity. 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//azc.cc/1DJ926I More Stories Roberts Pence working to overturn Trumps media ban July 29 2016 1201 p.m. Montini Pence decries name-calling.

Pictures and Village Roadshow Pictures ""Jupiter Ascending"" an original science fiction epic adventure from Lana and Andy Wachowski. In theaters on February 6 2015. Photo Credit Warner Bros. Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A lowly Chicago house cleaner discovers she is actually intergalactic royalty. Rated PG-13. BOTTOM LINE The Wachowskis trade their ""Matrix"" magic for the silliest space opera since ""Flash Gordon."" CAST Mila Kunis Channing Tatum Eddie Redmayne LENGTH 208 A cosmic Cinderella who cleans houses in Chicago is restored to her intergalactic throne by a genetically engineered half-wolf in ""Jupiter Ascending"" a totally bonkers space-opera written and directed by Andy and Lana Wachowski. The creators of the alt-reality ""Matrix"" trilogy and 2012s multi-epoch ""Cloud Atlas"" have always let their imaginations run wild but here theyre working on a whole new level. Detached from all logic blind to 50 years of science-fiction cliches and brimming with only bad ideas ""Jupiter Ascending"" is what happens when creative freedom slides into lunacy. Our heroine is Jupiter Jones (played by a deadpan Mila Kunis) a youngish housecleaner living with her tacky Russian family half of whom might as well be Yakov Smirnoff. Jupiter tries to sell her eggs to buy a telescope on eBay -- surely one of cinemas most surreal plot points -- but the clinic turns out to be staffed by aliens. To the rescue is Caine Wise a ""lycanton"" played by Channing Tatum in wolfish eyebrows and a goatee. Speedskating through the sky on his hover boots Caine whisks Jupiter to the palace of the Abrasax family a bunch of otherworldly nobles with British accents and names like Titus (Douglas Booth) and Kalique (Tuppence Middleton). advertisement | advertise on newsday ""Jupiter Ascending"" smashes together the narrative particles of everything from ""Richard III"" to ""Soylent Green"" with a cinematic style that could be called High Thor. Sean Bean plays a grizzled old space vet named Stinger; an unnamed Asian girl (Doona Bae) wears manga-blue hair and rides a hovercraft; the giant lizard thugs wear distressed leather jackets. A lengthy comedic sequence involving a beaucratic tax agency -- complete with old wooden desks and dusty filing cabinets -- is followed by an incest theme. The film reaches a feverish peak thanks to Eddie Redmayne who plays the villain Balem with a hoarse whisper sensuous eye-rolls and the camp hauteur of Bette Davis (he even waves around a nonexistent cigarette). Eventually it doesnt seem quite right to call ""Jupiter Ascending"" a bad movie. Its more like not guilty by reason of insanity.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet In Jupiter Ascending--an imaginatively goofy Rococo space opera written and directed by Andy and Lana Wachowski the sibling duo behind The Matrix the live-action Speed Racer and most of Cloud Atlas--an Anglo-Russian housecleaner is whisked away from Chicago by a pointy-eared half-albino dog-man and finds herself embroiled in a convoluted conspiracy that involves intergalactic tax codes inheritance law pseudo-incestuous marriage an economy that takes human capital literally and characters with names like Titus Abrasax and Chicanery Night. It is in other words just a few musical numbers and a whiff of marijuana smoke short of being the Thomas Pynchon book of big-budget effects-driven movie sci-fi. Whats sort of remarkable is the way the Wachowskis manage to digest all of their high- and low-brow influences into something like a cohesive worldview. These influences include but are not limited to Moebius; David Lynchs Dune; entry-level critiques of capitalism; the 1980 Flash Gordon movie; Brazil which gets both a dialogue reference (""27b-stroke-6"") and a Terry Gilliam cameo; spiritual transmigration; personal transformation; transhumanism. It might not be as compelling a synthesis of pop philosophy and geek tastes as The Matrix but it feels personal in the way that big-budget effects-driven movies rarely do. Maybe the sibling thing has something to do with it--that is this is not just a unique vision but a shared hashed-out vision. Jupiter Ascending stars Mila Kunis as Jupiter Jones a mouthy hard-luck everywoman who discovers that due to a genetic fluke shes legally entitled to the holdings of the Abrasax family a space-faring clinically immortal merchant house whose portfolio includes modern-day Earth. (Long story short Humans evolved a billion years ago in a different corner of the galaxy and have dominated the interstellar economy for hundreds of millions of years by seeding planets with their genetic material for reasons that Jupiter Ascending withholds until the halfway point.) She is pursued by rival bounty hunters including Caine Wise (Channing Tatum because why not) the aforementioned half-albino dog-man who was kicked off the space police for ripping someones throat out with his teeth had his wings surgically removed and now doesnt go anywhere without a pair of hover roller-blades. Pretty soon Jupiter and Caine--whos the principled kind of former-winged pointy-eared canine-hybrid bounty hunter--meet up with Stinger (Sean Bean) a fellow ex-space-cop who has retired to Earth to lead a low-profile life in a house full of bees.""Pretty soon"" in this case means after two attempted alien abductions a subplot involving Jupiters Russian cousin and an egg-donation scam the large-scale destruction and reconstruction of Chicagos South Loop intimations of a mass memory-wiping conspiracy and plenty of cuts away to the scheming Abrasax siblings one of whom lives inside the planet Jupiters Great Red Spot with his retinue of mouse people and dragons. Jupiter Ascending is not an easy movie to summarize; a viewer would probably need a diagram to work out the conflicting schemes of the Abrasaxes--Titus (Douglas Booth) Kalique (Tuppence Middleton) and Balem (Eddie Redmayne speaking in a compressed Brando-esque whisper)--who are also legally speaking Jupiters children. And anyway a plot-point-by-plot-point summary couldnt even begin to take into account all of the birdmen elephant people android lawyers magical technologies and gothic spaceships populating the edges of the frame or the movies gonzo internal mythology in which genes are both a currency and a religion.All of these things fit into a vision that should be familiar to anyone whos seen The Matrix a world of secret knowledge where humans live unaware that they are nodes in a system that depends on their ignorance--a system that in this case happens to be capitalism. Its hard not to admire the movies integrity Its a big effects-heavy spectacle that works exclusively on its own terms and despite being packed with incident in-jokes and vampire-aristocrat intrigue its a breeze--partly because the Wachowskis excel at managing and integrating effects and partly because the screwy fantasy theyve created is so fun to navigate.

"Jupiter Ascending | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; jupiter-ascending ) Jupiter Ascending (United States 2015) February 04 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli One of the key aspects of any science fiction or fantasy saga is world (or universe) building. This process refers to the creation and development of the reality in which the story transpires. More than mere background it informs plot development character motivation and nearly everything that transpires during the course of the narrative. Jupiter Ascending the latest eye-popping stepchild of the Wachowskis excels at universe building. The problem is that the backstory is too large to contain what appears on screen during the course of a 127-minute motion picture. Put another way Jupiter Ascending feels like a truncated Cliffs Notes version of something that might have worked a lot better as a mini-series. Two hours is too short for this tale and the end result suffers greatly because of that restriction. Visually Jupiter Ascending excels although those with an aversion to CGI may be offended. A close cousin to the special effects excesses of George Lucas in the Star Wars prequels Jupiter Ascending makes sure that its entire budget ends up on display. There are some jaw-dropping space battle scenes and more pyrotechnics than even Michael Bay has attempted. One can throw many criticisms at Jupiter Ascending but its never boring. It is however occasionally unfocused sometimes confusing and saddled with a too-predictable ending. The film begins in a low-key fashion introducing us to Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) a Russian immigrant to the United States who works as a paid maid to help her family make ends meet. Little does she know she has been targeted by an alien conglomerate for extermination. The Abrasax family - Balem (Eddie Redmayne) Kalique (Tuppence Middleton) and Titus (Douglas Booth) - see Jupiter as either a threat or an opportunity and act according to their own interests. Balem sends assassins to Chicago to eliminate her. Titus hires Caine (Channing Tatum) an elite ex-military ""hunter"" to protect her and bring her to him. Kalique plays her cards close to her chest; its unclear what her goals are until she reveals them. It doesnt take long before the laser beams start firing and Jupiter discovers she is very definitely no longer in Kansas - and not even on Earth. Jupiter Ascending is episodic and none of the episodes are developed as fully as they should be. The sense of incompleteness increases as the movie unspools. The love story between Jupiter and Caine is rushed giving the Padme/Anakin affair in Attack of the Clones a run for its money as the least convincing sci-fi screen romance in recent memory. Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum evidence little in the way of chemistry but this could be more the fault of the action-oriented script than an inability of the actors to meaningfully connect. And although Tatums casting is defensible the same claim cant be made of Kunis who is out of her depth. Delightful in smaller movies Kunis never convinces as the Earth-born space-faring heroine of this would-be epic. In many ways Jupiter is the least interesting character. The Abrasax siblings are more complex and deserving of a greater share of the screen time than they are accorded. Kaliques amoral ambiguity is fascinating and Titus oily charm and obscure motives make him a fascinating antagonist. Balem is a more straightforward villain although 2015 Oscar nominee Eddie Redmayne plays him like hes auditioning for a part in a remake of The Adventures of Priscilla Queen of the Desert. Sean Bean portrays a standard-order grizzled veteran whose loyalties are as flexible as circumstances dictate. Although Jupiter Ascending contains its share of missteps there is a moment of brilliance that deserves recognition. During an extended aside we are treated to a satirical look at the bureaucratic labyrinth that infects the alien society into which Jupiter is catapulted. She is shuttled from officious paper-pusher to officious paper-pusher without getting closer to a resolution. I was strongly reminded of Brazil - an intentional allusion made concrete when the final bureaucrat on Jupiters odyssey is played by none other than Terry Gilliam. Its as audacious a wink as one can imagine. Fans of the Wachowskis may be disappointed that Jupiter Ascending recalls their more recent efforts - the bloated Matrix sequels and Cloud Atlas - than it does the tight taut movies they made early in their careers (Bound and The Matrix in particular). Its a hit-and-miss affair - not so bad that it deserves dismissal but not good enough to earn a strong recommendation. The 3-D is a mess and Michael Giacchinos overbearing score frequently drowns out the dialogue.

"Jupiter Ascending review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review Jupiter Ascending Jupiter Ascending Warner Bros. Entertainment Channing Tatum as Caine Wise and Mila Kunis as Jupiter Jones in ""Jupiter Ascending."" Channing Tatum as Caine Wise and Mila Kunis as Jupiter Jones in ""Jupiter Ascending."" (Warner Bros. Entertainment) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Channing Tatums nifty jet boots aside the Wachowskis latest world-building exercise is pretty dull. In ""Jupiter Ascending"" Channing Tatums character is a ""splice"" an intergalactic bounty hunter with a distaste for shirts. His genetically engineered DNA contains both wolf and human strands. He sports wee pointy ears a lemon-brown goatee and a terrific pair of jet boots. Hes basically Shakespeares Puck plunked down in a story recalling ""The House of Atreus"" but in space.The movie doesnt really work but the jet boots would be the envy of Iron Man and they allow our hero unwisely named Caine Wise to speedskate through the air leaving pretty little trails of light over downtown Chicago. Mila Kunis character Jupiter Jones works as a cleaning lady and just before the films opening credits shes shown scrubbing a toilet looking sad. Her life lacks love and excitement. The movie takes care of business. Jupiter Jones may sound like the brand name for Tatums jet boots but in reality shes the rightful heir to planet Earth because she is a genetic ringer (reincarnated sort of) for the late matriarch of a high-toned family of bores who rule most of the known universe.Kunis falls a lot in ""Jupiter Ascending"" from great green-screen heights and screams even more though with Kunis youre not getting a simpy distressed damsel; she has actually learned to scream skeptically. Shes in the film so that Tatum can swoop in and catch her over and over en route to rescuing a better-written Cinderella in some other galaxy. I am this galaxys least reliable judge of writers-directors Lana and Andy Wachowski since I liked ""Speed Racer"" (and more sanely the first of their ""Matrix"" movies among other projects). There are plenty of design details in ""Jupiter Ascending"" worth noting. As proved by the 22nd century ""Neo Seoul"" section of ""Cloud Atlas"" the Wachowski siblings relish their van-art science-fiction landscapes packed with scary urban development and gunfire.But visionaries often lose their way in their own visions. The majority of moviemakers and movies stick to outdated predictable formulas and conventions. The Wachowskis on the other hand are not afraid to strand you early and often in ""Jupiter Ascending."" Jupiter Ascending spaceships may look familiar to Chicagoans Christopher Borrelli Depending how you see it and how generous you are the wonders of ""Jupiter Ascending"" the new space opera from Chicago filmmakers Lana and Andy Wachowski the team behind ""The Matrix"" should be endless.

Depending how you see it and how generous you are the wonders of ""Jupiter Ascending"" the new space opera from Chicago filmmakers Lana and Andy Wachowski the team behind ""The Matrix"" should be endless. For those who come to regard it as a camp classic (and this contingent will be legion) there... (Christopher Borrelli) The script struggles to tell a dull story straight. The sibling rivalry afoot in the House of Abrasax pits the sniveling Balem (Eddie Redmayne) against Titus (Douglas Booth) and Kalique (Tuppence Middleton) and when Redmayne whispers lines such as ""I have not crossed the vastness of space for your pleasantries"" you know youre in for another uninteresting round of expository catch-up.Still an image or two lingers. For one thing ""Jupiter Ascending"" explains those endlessly debated crop circles without stopping in its tracks for a verbal explanation. More bittersweetly at one point a starship commander portrayed by the commanding (and welcome) Nikki Amuka-Bird scolds Tatum whos fretting in the background by saying ""That pacings not helping.""

The second is always easier to answer. What does ""Jupiter Ascending"" look like? It looks amazing -- a mixture of both its imagery (a weird gene-spliced-in-every-way mix of ancient cultures and sci-fi technology) and its effects (flying warriors space portals and wall-to-wall digital 3D explosions). Whats it about? Thats something Im still puzzling out although it seems to start off with a bit of ""Cinderella"" quickly incorporates that favorite YA trope of ""the chosen one"" and spins off into a lot of free-floating villainy and flat or contradictory characters. But then you didnt really go to ""The Matrix"" for the story either did you?(Although if you did and stuck with it through the second and third films searching for a clearcut plot my sympathies). What the Wachowskis really reliably deliver is not so much a simple story as an entire universe. It is admitted a universe often populated by cut-out characters. But the worlds themselves always feel fully imagined -- as if youre seeing a movie adaptation of some series that already has a hundred comic-book issues behind it. (Like ""The Matrix"" however ""Jupiter Ascending"" is entirely original.) The story stars Mila Kunis as a reincarnation of a nearly ageless cosmic queen -- you know like Cher -- whose greedy heirs dont want her returning to reclaim their inheritance. So there are missions dispatched to kill her and to protect her and a whole lot of shuttling between various rocketship brigs and imperial throne rooms. Its hard to keep track without a cast list but Eddie Redmayne is the chief villain (we know this because he has a very posh accent and never speaks above a whisper except when he is VEXED.) Channing Tatum is the hero (we know this because he used to have wings. Also he goes Full Lautner taking his shirt off early in the movie and rarely remembering to put it back on.) That this is what passes for character development has to be accepted in a Wachowski picture; whats less easy to take is what a princess the queen-in-hiding really is. Until a brief scene at the end of the movie Kunis spends the entire film in peril - and then being rescued at the very last minute by Tatum flying in on his anti-gravity boots like some casual-Fridays Superman. Why cant Kunis ever save him? Or anyone? Obviously the Wachowskis love the look of liberation -- with their films full of body modification and tight black rubber-and-leather costumes -- and live their own lives without compromise. So why cant Jupiter -- the heroine of her own movie -- be the heroine of her own life too? So yes the movie looks wonderful (although theres nothing here quite on the level of the ""bullet-time"" in the first ""Matrix"" or even the compositional topsy-turvy of ""Speed Racer""). The cityscapes -- decadent palaces huge factory planets -- are truly epic and the effects overwhelm in 3D. (The film originally scheduled for last summer was reportedly held back so the Wachowskis could fine-tune every shot). But whats the movie about? Apparently for all the sci-fi trappings its about the oldest story of all -- beautiful royal in lovely gowns gets rescued by rough-hewn knight who then carries her off in his arms. Its a pretty daydream I suppose. But I expect more from modern fantasies than retro fantasy -- and we should expect a little more from the Wachowskis than this. Ratings note The film contains violence. Jupiter Ascending (PG-13) Warner Bros. (127 min.) Directed by Andy Wachowski Lana Wachowski. With Mila Kunis Channing Tatum Eddie Redmayne.

"Review Jupiter Ascending is a beautiful mess - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Jupiter Ascending is a beautiful messBy Tony Hicksthicksbayareanewsgroup.comPosted 02/03/2015 035916 PM PSTUpdated 02/04/2015 045112 PM PST There were a couple points in ""Jupiter Ascending"" that provoked a big burst of laughter from the audience at a recent screening I attended.That is usually great -- if the movie is a comedy.Sadly thats not the case here. ""Jupiter Ascending"" is a screaming speeding train wreck of wild special effects that goes off the rails when the plot develops gaping holes and takes inexplicable turns. Give directors Andy and Lana Wachowski credit for trying to make a film that shows more than it tells but that doesnt work when its not clear what key characters are trying to accomplish or whose side theyre on. By the time the muddy story clears -- sort of -- the movie is a smoking albeit colorful pile of nonsensical silliness.It is difficult to ascertain for example whether protagonist Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) and her rescuer/servant/love interest/invulnerable soldier/human hybrid Cain (Channing Tatum) have good chemistry because there are too many distractions (Tatums eyeliner and pointy ears among them) what with all the explosions and shooting and spaceship-chasing. While Kunis clearly isnt ready to be an action hero yet she does manage to make her character the only thing in the movie worth caring about. The same cant be said of Tatum whos a good actor and an effective action star. But here he just seems wooden and almost embarrassed at times.But if you love the idea of dozens of Mila Kunis close-ups -- in 3-D no less -- this is the film for you.Advertisement Jupiter is a Chicago girl with a semi-amusing (yes intentionally) large Russian family. She and her mother are cleaning women (the sight of someone as bright and gorgeous as Kunis scrubbing other peoples toilets is the first hint of the coming heap of unbelievability). Turns out Jupiter is unknowingly the queen of a galactic dynasty and the subject of a political power struggle involving three royal siblings One wants her dead; another hires super soldier-turned bounty hunter Cain to snatch her from Earth. Naturally everyone shows up at the same time and a mostly enjoyable battle ensues destroying a good chunk of downtown Chicago. That is OK because aliens can wave their hands undo the damage and make humans forget it ever happened.Cain and Jupiter enlist the help of Cains old commander Stinger (a tired-looking Sean Bean mostly wasted in the role) who of course has long-standing issues with Cain. Of course they get to brawling before they can team up again. The bad guys -- some really ugly thugs resembling ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" aliens after a three-year bender -- join in and the fighting spreads into outer space.The extraterrestrial scenery is spectacular even if the characters look like they just auditioned for a ""Fifth Element"" parody. Its here the ridiculousness gauge red-lines thanks to space alien Balem (Eddie Redmayne) who wants Jupiter dead and Earth wiped out for a particularly gross reason that involves lots of money. Redmayne may have been wonderful in ""The Theory of Everything"" but hes so over the top and hysterical in his mood swings here that he brings a big chunk of the aforementioned unintentional comedy. Jupiter ends up with Balems duplicitous brother Titus (Douglas Booth) but not before meeting their sister Kalique Abrasax (Tuppence Middleton) who explains the royal familys connection to Jupiter and how theyve managed to rule for thousands of years.Yes Jupiter owns Earth. She just doesnt know it.At this point characters are making seriously questionable decisions without blinking and the whole thing starts to resemble the worlds most expensive midnight movie. Of course many good sci-fi action movies contain plot holes big enough to drive a Death Star through. But the Wachowskis (""The Matrix"") pound their audience with sensory overload cliches and predictability to the point of boredom. Not to ruin the (non) surprise but by the 37th time Cain bucks unbelievable odds to save Jupiter there isnt a shred of suspense. Its why the big climax despite its overblown and loud effects is mostly yawn-inducing. ""Jupiter Ascending"" is the film equivalent of a baseball slugger unleashing a huge swing and missing. Only in this case the bat flies out of his hands fires 3-D lasers at the crowd and zooms 1000 feet into the sky before exploding. It sure looks spectacular but its still a swing and a miss.

Daily Edition Login to download Jupiter Ascending Film Review 900 PM PST 2/2/2015 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Another stab at sci-fi from The Matrix makers falls short TWITTER Another ambitious effort from the Wachowskis that possesses familiar sci-fi genre elements but anyone hoping for the old Matrix magic will be disappointed. Even with all its familiar action tropes less-than-fresh special effects and loopy plotting the most depressing element in the Wachowski siblings latest sci-fi mash is that as they conceive it human society has been around for more than a billion years but is still presided over by a rivalrous British-style royal family that treacherously behaves as if it were the 1550s. Wont the ruling class ever learn? With costumes and elaborate hairdos just slightly less risible than those in the Wachowskis last outing Cloud Atlas but with similarly underachieved outsized aims Jupiter Ascending at least possesses familiar sci-fi genre elements that are promotable to its target audience and will thereby generate reasonable returns especially overseas. But anyone hoping for the old Matrix magic to rematerialize (its been 15 years) is due for more disappointment. Once again the Wachowskis are nothing if not ambitious as they create a theory of existence that posits the notion that were even smaller pawns in a cosmic system than we might have imagined mere ""livestock"" to a ruling clan based elsewhere in the cosmos that suddenly finds itself in a power struggle following the unexpected demise of a matriarch of 100000 years standing. Waiting in the intergalactic wings are three progenies with different approaches to dealing with a lowly Chicago maid who it is discovered has the precise genetic makeup of their late mother which therefore technically entitles the young woman to become queen of the universe. A true Cinderella Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) cleans toilets to earn her keep with an extended Russian family that includes her mother and aunt her astrophysicist father having been murdered back in the old country. Giving literal meaning to sweeping a woman off her feet a muscle-bound dude named Caine (Channing Tatum) who wears shoes that enable him to lift off the ground and skate between the skyscrapers takes Jupiter in his arms and zips her between the Loops skyscrapers which gratifyingly look to have been restored to mint condition after having been so thoroughly trashed four years ago in Transformers Dark of the Moon. Unfortunately they are blown to smithereens all over again here. See more New Jupiter Ascending Trailer Puts Mila Kunis Front and Center Caine spirits Jupiter to a farm occupied by fellow tough guy Stinger (Sean Bean) who unnerves the young lady by persistently addressing her as ""Your Majesty""; hes able to discern her lineage because the bees he keeps start acting up the moment she arrives and as he explains ""Bees are genetically disposed to recognize royalty."" Any hope that Jupiter Ascending might be designed to make sense on any level is pretty much jettisoned from this point forward although Jupiter does get an explanation of sorts as to why shes now to be viewed as the Chosen One. As for the macho men theyre veteran Legionnaires with bad attitudes toward authority so Jupiter now has loyal (to become loving) assistance in warding off the warriors and monsters who arrive to snatch her away. For their part the royal siblings who live on assorted far-flung planets of their own have different attitudes about how to deal with this unexpected rival. The dominant one among them the clearly twisted Balem (Eddie Redmayne speaking in whispery constrained tones) just wants her out of the way ASAP and does all he can to arrange it. The one female heir Kalique (Tuppence Middleton) takes a calculatedly friendly approach inviting the Earthling as a guest. The youngest pretty boy Titus (Douglas Booth) schemes to keep Jupiter on the sidelines while outfoxing his brother and sister. Theyre a swell bunch the three of them. Other than to dictate the power dynamics of the ruling family the films conceptual dimensions yield very little of interest. If the Earth is really a colony being exploited economically by leaders capable of instantaneous travel and equipped with enormously advanced technology its completely unclear how this works or what the impact is on its citizens; everything seems quite as normal. Read more Netflix Gives 10-Episode Order to Wachowskis Sense8 The films geographic distinctions are also poorly registered. Balem lives on Jupiter but the others who knows where. If humans live elsewhere in the solar system and beyond under the dominion of this royal family there must be some universal apparatus linking them or holding the empire together but we see or hear no evidence of that. The technological advances glimpsed are enormous but they look to have been kept effectively under wraps and out of view of ordinary people which is perplexing. The prolonged final action sequence goes to the very edge of becoming ridiculous. Unlike The Matrix certainly there is nothing conceptual here that catches the viewers fancy only the spectacle of an ordinary young lady being swept up into extraordinary circumstances. The slowly percolating romance between Jupiter and her guardian may sweep young fans of Kunis and Tatum along up to a point but while the characters swing through the air with the greatest of ease thanks to Caines late-model boots the love story never becomes something to swoon over; theres something about the strapping mans little blond goatee and elfin ears thats a bit weird. For her part Kunis maintains her composure and doesnt have quite as hard a time as she had in her misbegotten role in Oz the Great and Powerful. We now know from Foxcatcher that Tatum is capable of much more than this sort of he-man role while Redmayne can hope that balloting for a certain prestigious award is finished before voters get a load of his melodramatics on display here. Director Terry Gilliam has a bit part playing an eccentric bureaucrat in a distinctly Brazil-like office. Special effects and technical work here are second-tier acceptable but not on a level with the likes of Interstellar Gravity and other cutting-edge sci-fi productions.

In ""Cloud Atlas"" the Wachowskis wildly overreached while tackling the notion of reincarnation via a daring genre-spanning nonlinear narrative that challenged the very limits of conventional storytelling. Now with ""Jupiter Ascending"" the subject arises once again albeit in the most banal been-there-done-that way imaginable as a garish ""Phantom Menace""-esque space opera in which a lowly Russian cleaning lady (Mila Kunis) is born with DNA identical to that of the most powerful woman in the universe. The movie refers to this statistical improbability as a ""recurrence"" which could also describe the painfully familiar feeling we get from watching the Wachowskis fail once again this time on an unrecoverable 175 million budget despite whatever boost Imax 3D ticket sales can add. Originally slated to open on July 25 2014 the Warner Bros. release slipped back more than six months under the excuse that the production needed more time to finish its elaborate visual effects -- which to be fair are among the most stunning ever witnessed in a genre known for mind-blowing imagery. But in the meantime the studio has made little attempt to communicate to audiences what the film is despite what should be a fairly straightforward marketing pitch Its a fairy tale writ on the largest possible scale embellished with a love story between the oblivious princess Jupiter Jones (Kunis) and the chivalrous skyjacker Caine Wise (Channing Tatum) who rips her out of her dreary existence and reveals her true destiny. One day Her Majesty is scrubbing toilets in Chicago hotels; the next shes being pursued across the galaxy by three greedy intergalactic royals -- Balem (Eddie Redmayne) Kalique (Tuppence Middleton) and Titus (Douglas Booth). As the surviving members of the Abrasax dynasty the trio is threatened by the fact that this less-enlightened human shares their dead mothers genetic identity thereby entitling her to claim control of the vast tracts of interspace real estate they all covet. Its a weird loophole in conventional inheritance law If the deceased party should happen to be reborn all property falls to her -- the odds of which are about as good as someone finding a Bombay street urchin with fingerprints that match those of the Queen of England. But what do we know? According to the films own mythology Earthlings are just entering the genetic age. Meanwhile a long time ago in a galaxy far far away an elite clan of humans discovered a way to extend their lives almost indefinitely by extracting a glowing opalescent liquid from other humans whom they plant on conducive worlds then wait patiently for millennia until overpopulation exceeds their allotted planets ability to sustain life at which point the Abrasax landlords swoop in to harvest the entire species. (Where are the Guardians of the Galaxy when you need them?) Simple cloning didnt work out so well for the Abrasax rulers although their over-decorated homes appear to be crawling with new species (subservient lizard officers and short gangly aliens) as well as several interesting genetic hybrids. Gugu Mbatha-Raw appears with big rodent-like ears for example while Tatums character turns out to be a Lycantant a crossbreed of a wolf and a man. Apart from his greenish-blond goatee and ever-so-slightly pointed ears he doesnt look all that inhuman though he claims to have more in common with a dog -- which is just fine for Jupiter who beams ""I love dogs Ive always loved dogs"" when the information comes out. Also Caine once had wings but theyve been clipped as punishment for some previous infraction though he makes do with his floating ""surf boots."" From their lesbian-themed thriller ""Bound"" to the race-blind karma inquiry ""Cloud Atlas"" the Wachowskis have always been heavily politicized in their filmmaking. Here this elaborate concept of a virtually immortal human elite seeding other civilizations throughout the galaxy functions as a fairly lazy critique of capitalism. In this alternate universe even genocide runs on the pursuit of profit and apparently theres nothing more profitable to be done with entire worlds full of humans than to drain their collective life force -- the aftermath of which we see on a deserted world (essentially the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao surrounded by blue sand) where the three siblings survey their most recent harvest. This too is a recurring motif in the Wachowskis work recycling ""The Matrixs"" massive system of predatory incubators in which the human race lies dormant. But that movie had a terrific villain whereas neither pretty-boy Booth nor the physically unimposing Redmayne (who sucks in his words like some kind of space vampire) can muster much menace. While the Wachowskis have always put their greatest emphasis on aesthetics they allow the visual impulse to get the best of them here investing so much attention in creating unique fashions technology architecture and design that theyve blinded themselves to the huge logical gaps in their own story. Instead of serving as a lauchpad for big ideas as their past pics have ""Jupiter Ascending"" asks audiences to check their brains at the door and settle for candy-colored riffs on overplayed damsel-in-distress gimmicks. Although clearly conceived as an empowered female heroine poor Jupiter spends most of the movie being kidnapped and shuffled from one unpleasant situation to another whether thats being nearly assassinated during an egg-donating operation or pushed into a marriage with a two-faced Abraxas prince (the geisha-like costume for which trumps even Natalie Portmans iconic ""Star Wars"" look). Those upset by the ontological implications of ""Prometheus"" are likely to find ""Jupiter Ascendings"" working theory of mankinds origins even less satisfying. The movie spends hardly any time reflecting on the idea that all mans scientific advances have been redundant (having been first discovered millennia ago) while all his cultural ones are expendable -- including movies which are nothing more than distractions for a race being groomed to fill the bathwater of the rich and powerful. Here Kalique functions as a sort of sci-fi update on Countess Elizabeth Bathory who attempted to extend her youth by bathing in the blood of virgins. She appears long enough to rescue Jupiter and explain the rules before disappearing for the remainder of the film. People have a way of doing that in ""Jupiter Ascending"" in which characters whose allegiances were never clear are constantly switching sides before being forgotten altogether (like the blue-haired bounty hunter so determined to kill Caine early on). It all comes down to a problem of world-building a skill at which the Wachowskis excelled on ""The Matrix."" But their weaknesses were revealed soon after in the ""Matrix"" sequels where the sheer scale of the project overwhelmed their ability to focus in on the core narrative. Here buried under decibels of deafening score (from J.J. Abrams favorite composer Michael Giacchino working without the solid underlying musical theme of his Pixar and ""Star Trek"" work) the movie zips from one dazzling setting to another back and forth between Earth and Jupiter and who knows where else. No sooner have the Wachowskis built it than intergalactic rescue dog Caine comes crashing through walls to tear it all down. Hard to believe but for all the Abrasaxs technological superiority it takes just one small hole in the ceiling to bring an entire refinery city crumbling to the ground and while it all looks quite stunning the Wachowskis really should have spent that extra six months on development focusing on the script rather than the visuals. After this debacle it will be a long time before the kind of recurrence where anyone trusts the duo with a budget anywhere near this scale again. Film Review Jupiter AscendingReviewed at Warner Bros.

Steve Talbert says May 18 2016 at 254 am Sorry for typos. Now that I think about it there are so many little things that are almost thrown away...like the way the android guide comes across another with the same face and how they both notice but dont acknowledge to the other but then seem bothered by it. But maybethey arent. Maybe thats more the actor. But the whole interaction is scripted to be that way. .with cut shots and pacing .yet if you missed it it wouldnt necessarily hurt or help your experience in watching the rest of the film. Thats what i mean about texture and why its rewatchable but not required to gsin any additional insight into a very basic story. So if you like films like that you will definitely like this one. Reply Steve Talbert says May 18 2016 at 241 am I stumbled into this movie on HBO flipping channels and its visual style is great. The story has been done before but in ScFi and Action Films that is a feature not a bug. It provide a familiar trope as a framework to see how the edges blur. The basic plot is understandable you dont need to know anything beforehand the main characters are likeable you can understand the basic ialogue and the villians almost pitiful. I will definitely watch it again and also would pay if it came around again on a big screen. So isnt that a sign of success""?? For me yes but there might not be 175 million of me. I think it will hold up better than Matrix over time and cultures. I liked Cloud Atlas but once youve seen the pattern it is BORING the 2nd time. What makes this movie interesting is BECAUSE of the unexplored parts. It seems you are only seeing parts of a complete world that is going on now before and continues. ...just like in life where people come and go with unknown motivation things thst seem important disappear and random events have a pattern in hindsight. That kind of texture in this film makes it easy AND interesting to rewatch. It can be eye candy or deeply philosophical or both. Thats rare in action and most sci fi out there. A great gamily and date film but also good for preteens and old people who cant follow some newer styles that jerk around too much. Just some comments from a non professional movie watcher. Reply Donald DiNaro says October 28 2015 at 1252 pm If you live long enough and you have a real memory you find that all these Sci-Fi stories are borrowing little ""KEY""concepts from each other  movie after movie book after book going all the way back to Jules Verne ""First men on the Moon"" Theres no way that i agree with the reviewer that Jupiter ascending is any less fallible than any-other SciFi movie. Peter Debruge-Chief International Film Critic hasnt lived long enough too remember and his criticism acts like these stories are all original writing which there not somehow he gives himself  a special observational power certificate. Where were the critics when George Lucas movie "" Star wars"" ripped off Edgar Rice Burroughs A Princess of Mars (1912). or Disney movie; ""John Carter"" simply changed the title and merged a 1912 story with a 1964 story. Since most modern movies make their money in World Wide Box-Office DVD sales also TV rights of all sources of income too say this movie LOST money is NOT the final truth and a obvious untruthfulness Hollywood has always sort to keep hidden from the general public. Truth is this movie has great CGI good acting Great filming and just continues and peaks the interest of a new generation of young people to follow the story lines as mankind has always done in the last Four-thousand years. Reply Amos Batto says June 2 2015 at 619 am After watching the movie I would say that the movie feels disjointed and needed to be longer with less action scenes and more dialog to develop the characters. However after you start to analyze the film it starts to get much better. The movie feels disjointed because you only see characters for a short period of time in the film. Each of the three siblings have something interesting to say about how Capitalism works. If you look at this film as a critique of Capitalism and see the protagonist as a hero of the proletariat then this is a fascinating film. The protagonist is not a superhero. She is an ordinary girl with no superpowers and is not a GI Jane with insane fighting skill. She is a working-class girl who dreams of escaping but once she sees how royalty lives off the lives of the lower-classes she rejects being part of the 1% and she returns to living as a ordinary cleaning woman who has working-class solidarity and loves her family despite all its faults. We hardly ever see a big-budget movie which critiques the destructive and hedonistic tendencies of the 1% and extols working-class people as heroes. The film also is a critique of the US immigration system and its beauracracy. It is full of references to past movies (Wizard of Oz Brazil etc.). The movie takes longer to understand than most Hollywood films and you probably have to watch it a couple times to fully understand it but in my opinion it is far better and has much more to say than 99% of the films in the theatres. Critiques of the film should at least evaluate the film on an intellectual level and try to understand its deeper themes. Reply wiles11 says October 1 2015 at 443 pm You sound like a teenager who just figured this shit out. Everything it took you multiple viewings to figure out was right there on the surface all along. This is not a deep film. Its an OBVIOUS one. Dazzling to look at but NOT very deep. Critiques of capitalism in science fiction and horror shows -- especially the haves using the have-nots as food/energy/blood -- are a dime a dozen. The Wachowskis only make it MORE obvious with all the references to OTHER MOVIES that use the same trope. Reply Robin says May 10 2015 at 1142 am The movie lacked coherence at the beginning of the movie similar to some other recent sci fi movies that have relied on book readers to understand the plot ( example "" The Giver"") but lacking a book to give the coherence to interested sci viewers. Once the plot is understood because it simplifies to simplistic unsuspecting female gives in twice to overpowering evil males requiring saving by hero male it lacks any great improvement on any other more simplistic male dominated sci fi theme. Reply Robin says May 10 2015 at 1154 am Further comment credit writers for trying to portray highly suspicious heroine- but suspicious females do not give in to pressure so easy and women who give in so easy are not as suspicious - usually caught way off guard so have no option but to give in...she was a mixture of two different types that did not play right... Reply David says May 6 2015 at 1251 pm Ive kind of scanned the reviews and I have to say I doubt most of the people writing reviews watched the movie. They all have one thing in common they dont like something about somebody involved in the movie so they write a bunch of garbage...You want the truth this is a good movie go get it on VUDU and watch it. Then come back here and take a minute to tell it like it is and shut these morons up. Reply FM Talks says February 6 2015 at 1019 pm The trailer looks bad. Channing Tatum look sillier than usual. Its hilarious how some team is intent on making him happen. Looks deserving of a bad review. Reply Mindy says February 6 2015 at 1101 am Wow what did they do? Take a splicer across multiple movies and TV shows. ""human elite seeding other civilizations throughout the galaxy"" this is right out of The Stargate TV shows. IE- the Ancients created devices ""SG-1 episode about Dakara"" that seeded a galaxy with human life. In turn the Ancients / Alterrans shed their human bodies to become energy - essentially becoming immortal. I supposed the argument could be made that its all been done and said""- the difference is in the perspective and presentation. Never the less Ive been wanting to see this film and despite the negative reviews I still will. Reply David Young says February 5 2015 at 745 am Yeah well you know thats just like your opinion man... instead of reviewing the movie.. looks like you are reviewing Wachowskis ... i guess you are seeing this film in the same way you see all those Sundance films... Both are different and targeted for different audience ... Apples and Oranges man... Reply whoopsie says February 4 2015 at 709 pm This movie defies logic and reinforces the myth of whiteness as all powerful. Whiteness cannot produce color. It can only reproduce after its own kind. So the chances the ""most powerful"" peeps in the universe would be melanin free seems illogical and frankly stupid. On this planet called Earth pale skin and climate change do not mix well. With the ever increasing hole in the ozone layer we see an increase in deadly skin cancers among the tanless e.g. ""white"". Tanless skin also has a short shelf life. White women start wrinkling and graying in their twenties. It seems more like a weak link than the enduring DNA of a ""master"" human race. Im gonna have to pass on this one even though I loved the Matrix trilogy. Reply JJ says February 3 2015 at 1055 pm Who keeps giving these guys so much money to make movies? I think theyd fare better on a tight budget. Reply neillbert says February 3 2015 at 606 pm Seems a bit harsh to say that it will never make its money back. I hate it when before a film has even come out critics and media alike all start labelling something a flop. State your views on the film and leave it at that. Reply Pinhead the Xenobite says February 3 2015 at 731 pm No but I enjoy the psychic cruelty. And this review gives me that in spades. Reply harry georgatos says February 3 2015 at 329 pm The Wachowskis have to move out of the sci-fi genre for a while and move into different material. The trailer was a massive disappointment as it seems tiresome with STAR WARS cliches and a high level of blandness. Maybe the can do a contempoary spy movie but definitely something different. The only two good films they manage to pull off was the first MATRIX and BOUND. CLOUD ATLAS has good moments with dull moments. If the MATRIX sequels go ahead Warners should look elsewhere without the Wachowskis. Reply guest says February 3 2015 at 106 pm or the whole genre is finally becoming tiresome...I hope Reply atomic studio says February 3 2015 at 1022 am just looking at channing tantum with the elf ears is enough to make you shrug. what the hell were they thinking? the main characters look laughably silly. i never really thought the matrix was a fantastic piece of science fiction but i can appreciate what it did for filmmaking- but nothing has even come close that level of fun (anyone remember road racer? lol). Reply Joel says February 3 2015 at 1014 am Wow this is a really well-written review. Thank you. Seriously thank you. Still looking forward to seeing this despite assumptions that the female leads sometimes-shrill voice could be a disservice to the film. Reply Liz Calvario says February 3 2015 at 857 am Best line ""The Wachowskis really should have spent that extra six months on development focusing on the script rather than the visuals."" Visuals are extraordinary and the costume design is so intricate and the best part of the film for me. But yes it lacked a narrative. Reply matteobject says February 3 2015 at 442 pm Theres no way they were actually spending those six months tarting up the visual effects I cant think of a single film where thats actually been the case. ""The visual effects werent ready"" really means ""this film is testing horribly and we need massive reshoots"". See also Monuments Men. Reply Bob says February 4 2015 at 815 am They pushed GRAVITY back 12 months but that wasnt an ordinary movie. JimmyFitz says February 3 2015 at 854 am What a waste of money. Its going to go in the toilet. Reply Paul Nash says February 3 2015 at 746 am You know I plan to watch this film on the weekend and what I expect is a retro 1920s to 30s pulp scifi extravaganza which I will enjoy for what it is. Critics are quick to jump on the fault-finding bandwagon but not all of the criticism is warranted. Jupiter Ascending is meant to be fun and I expect it will be. The previous film by the Wachowskis Cloud Atlas was a wonderful film as far as I am concerned and I watched it several times to pick up on all of the synergistic threads. Its ideas were a serious exploration on many levels (though it also helps to have previously read the book by David Mitchell and to view the first segment -- a future post-apocalyptic Hawaii where folks speak in a strange dialect -- with subtitles). I also really liked the film V for Vendetta for which the Wachowskis wrote the screenplay. Rather than come down on two very creative and interesting filmmakers I would just like to glean the best aspects of their movies whether or not there are any apparent flaws and look forward to their future efforts. Reply Daryle says February 3 2015 at 830 am It appears from some of the other comments that a fair number of people really didnt like Cloud Atlas but I agree with Paul Nash that it was actually a pretty good movie. Its length almost did me in (at a late evening showing at the theatre) but I thought it was a film that really made one think. Thus I think Mr. DeBruge may be overly harsh on the Wachowskis at least with respect to that film. Unfortunately it seems he may be right as far as Jupiter Ascending goes and its also too bad story-wise that Jupiter ends up to be a damsel-in-peril/distress role. What do so many moviemakers and writers have against women as strong protagonists? That said it doesnt look like the other roles are well-written either. Reply Alexander says February 3 2015 at 710 am Its never a good signal when a movie that was planned for summer ends up in February. Reply irwinator1992 says February 3 2015 at 609 am Between this and the ticking time bomb ""Seventh Son"" I would choose neither and flock to the new Spongebob movie instead (I have been a Spongebob fan since childhood). Kingsman is next on my wishlist after that. Reply J. Paul Christian says February 3 2015 at 539 am Here again we see the failed premise of money plus controlling power causing film makers to lose their way. We really did not need another example but such is the industry run by blind superficial egos and frantic-guess pursuit of profits. If Cloud Atlas was not disappointing enough for you just wait until you see what the blind leading the blind has cooked up this time. Reply jcdbrown says February 3 2015 at 354 am Id pay 14 just to see Douglas Booth alone. Reply Alex Walker says February 3 2015 at 707 am You clearly have the internet. Google him. Its free. Save yourself 14. Reply Jonathan Karate says February 3 2015 at 129 am Its time for the new paradigm in sci-fi action film to appear and take hold just as ""The Matrix"" did in 1999 when it arrived with a thunderclap that rocked the genre (and the industry). The Wachowskis attempt here to chase the over-produced over-recycled 3D midichlorian mythos will hopefully be their last mega-budget film before a a more manageable return to story. And ""Cloud Atlas"" is unwatchable. Why anyone likes that film is beyond me. Reply Guy Benson says February 5 2015 at 558 am Couldnt disagree more. For all its faults ""Cloud Atlas"" offers far more wonderful thought-provoking moments than most sic-fi films Ive watched. It does require several viewings to pick up all the threads but I found it well-worth the effort. As for ""Jupiter Ascending"" Ill go see it for what it is popcorn space opera. Reply Fre says February 2 2015 at 1123 pm Well... then Ill go in with no expectations other than feasting on some meaty visuals. If they dont hit the target this round... no more .357 hello .22 caliber when it comes to budget control and most everything else. Hope its good and if so does well. Reply Alexander says February 2 2015 at 1103 pm The only thing consistent about the Wachowskis work now is that it gets consistently worse with each successive film. And their choice of actors goes with it. I fail to see how it can much worse than Tatum. Reply David says February 2 2015 at 1017 pm The Wachowskis appear to be following the Shyamalan approach to filmmaking impress with a thoughtful inventive first movie and then spend the next 15 years making self-indulgent dreck. Perhaps there will come a point where they return to a focus on storytelling. Reply Mr Furious says February 2 2015 at 1016 pm What made the Wachowskis so good at world building for The Matrix was the fact that they were ripping off other peoples already built worlds. Reply aaron says February 3 2015 at 119 am Oh that old consistently disproven internet hoax again? Reply Guy Benson says February 5 2015 at 555 am Oh please stop with the protests about The Matrix be wrongfully accused of being derivative. Anyone who has read sci-fi for any length of time can see just how many tropes they threw together with a ridiculous dose of mish-mashed pseudo-religion. I didnt care for any of the Matrix films although number 1 did do some cool things for the genre. A better film of that type was the one that came out the same year as the Matrix but got overshadowed by it ""Dark City."" As for Cloud Atlas I thought it was brilliant and thought provoking. nerdrage says February 3 2015 at 849 am Nah anyone familiar with sci fi literature could see for themselves all the tropes they ripped off. But you would have to actually read. See All 39 Comments More Film News from Variety The Power of Content HBO Boss Talks True Detective Season 3 Deadwood Movie...

Fresh from blending dystopian sci-fi period drama posh-boy cannibalism and just about everything else under the sun in the gloriously insane Cloud Atlas theyve taken a step backwards forwards and skywards with this berserk space opera. Jupiter Ascending weaves in the messianic elements of The Matrix the punch-in-the-eye visual intensity of Speed Racer and the fruity performances of Cloud Atlas - not to mention random splashes of Dune Foundation Flash Gordon Barbarella and Brazil - into one breathtaking mindscrambling what-the-hell-am-I-watching intergalactic fantasy. It could very well end their careers but theyll be going out with one hell of a bang.Mila Kunis plays Jupiter Jones a Russian immigrant in modern-day Chicago whose workaday life takes an unexpected turn when she becomes an assassination target for scenery-shredding Shakespearean psycho Eddie Redmayne the universes premier power-broker. Whisked to safety by hired hunter Channing Tatum (part wolf part man all beefcake) and his amazing anti-grav boots Jupiter learns that she is the genetic reincarnation of the Queen of the Universe a title which grants her infinite wealth and the power to control bees for some reason. Wed love to say that the Wachowskis manage to wrangle all these disparate elements into a satisfying whole but this is one mad mess from start to finish crammed with flying dinosaur sidekicks fetish-mask robots impossible-to-follow intrigue and ripe bizarrely straight-faced dialogue. But the sheer ambition is impossible to ignore and the sense of fun is infectious you may fear for your sanity during Jupiter Ascending but youll come out smiling.

Inducing gasps and giggles in equal quantities its a film better enjoyed not as ""from the makers of The Matrix and Cloud Atlas"" but rather as ""the most expensive movie Roger Corman never made."" Trying to keep up with the plots counter-plots deceptions and shifting allegiances will make your head swim but thankfully ""Jupiter Ascending"" boils down to good aliens and bad aliens with no shortage of adrenaline-packed set pieces and intergalactic scenery that looks like it belongs on the side of a van. (And I mention both of these facets as selling points.) See Video Channing Tatum Saves Mila Kunis in Jupiter Ascending Trailer From Matrix Directors (Video) Mila Kunis stars as Jupiter Jones an undocumented alien born in a trunk a steamer cargo hold actually as her Russian mother Aleksa (Maria Doyle Kennedy) fled to America after mobsters killed her British astronomer husband Maximilian (James DArcy). Working with her mother and aunt as a housekeeper Jupiter laments her life of scrubbing toilets splurging on the occasional big-ticket item as a way to find happiness. Jupiter is far from your average human however; turns out shes a genetic Recurrence of space royalty a millennia-old woman who left ownership of much of the universe divided between the three conniving Abrasax heirs ambitious Balem (Eddie Redmayne camping it up) devious Kalique (Tuppence Middleton) and hedonistic Titus (Douglas Booth ""Noah""). They all want to get their hands on mummys property particularly a little planet called Earth one thats so overpopulated that its lifeforms are ripe for harvest in order to make the goo that keeps these interstellar point-one-percenters so young-looking after all these centuries. The only hope for Jupiters -- and humanitys -- survival is Caine Wise (Channing Tatum) a disgraced super-soldier with flying boots and strains of wolf DNA. He whisks Jupiter away from Titus minions (in a big battle sequence that includes a breathtaking dogfight over downtown Chicago) and teams up with fellow veteran Stinger Apini (Sean Bean) to help Jupiter reclaim her inheritance in relative safety. Also Read Channing Tatum Mila Kunis Jupiter Ascending to Premiere at Secret Sundance Screening Theres a lot of fighting and chasing and conniving and falling (Jupiter plummets from a whole lot of high places over the course of this 3D film) with the occasional break for pages of exposition or would-be laughs; the latter leads us to the movies clunkiest sequence with Jupiter navigating alien bureaucracy to reclaim her possessions from a previous life. Its an extended homage to ""Brazil"" complete with reference to ""27-B-stroke-6"" and a Terry Gilliam cameo and like the contemporary segment of ""Cloud Atlas"" its a reminder that for all the Wachowskis many gifts as filmmakers comedy isnt necessarily high on the list. But who cares if the story is occasionally impenetrable or if some gags land with a thud when the thrills and the eye candy keep coming at such a breathless pace? ""Jupiter Ascending"" doesnt break the new ground that the Wachowskis have managed in the past -- if anything is going to date films of the early 21st century to future audiences more than iPhone ringtones its the overuse of blue and orange in action movies -- but the film never slacks in its efforts to wow us. From that thrilling skirmish over the Windy City to an elaborate outer-space royal wedding (in which Kunis wears the nuttiest headdress this side of Elizabeth Taylor in ""Boom"") the movie wisely never stops long enough for us to ask too many questions. See Video Channing Tatum Reunited With His Childhood Imaginary Friend on Jimmy Kimmel Live (Video) Jupiter seems as confused as we are; she spends most of her time trying to figure out whats going on and as such Kunis has to play reactively having things explained to her when shes not being rescued over and over. Still the actress makes us believe in the characters noble heritage (even Stingers honeybees acknowledge her royalty) and by the end of the movie shes allowed to make decisions (and kick enough ass) to establish herself as an engaging heroine. Tatums role mostly comes down to stunts and smoldering and he does both well even while sporting pointy doggy ears and guyliner. The Wachowskis have cast an international ensemble of actors -- including Gugu Mbatha-Raw (""Behind the Lights"") Nikki Amuka-Bird (""Luther"") and Doona Bae (""Cloud Atlas"") -- as their aliens; their resonance relies upon how much of an impression they can make with a minute or two of screen time. Having seemingly borrowed a closetful of ensembles from Dame Shirley Bassey Redmayne manages to steal all his scenes as the universes most petulant would-be landlord. Ultimately this all boils down to two questions 1) Is ""Jupiter Ascending"" completely bananas? Absolutely. 2) Will you have fun watching it? As long as youre OK with the answer to the first question I dont see why not. Breaking News To Your Inbox.
