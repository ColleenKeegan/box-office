By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 928pm on Thursday Apr. 30 2015 Thursday Apr. 30 2015 Friday May. 01 2015 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Its perhaps appropriate that the summer movie season kicks off with Avengers Age of Ultron. It checks all the right boxes Its long loud larded with effects and sporadically witty and it sets up events for yet another sequel.What it doesnt have is any sense of going above and beyond. Unlike some other entries in the Marvel universe -- the first Iron Man Captain America The Winter Soldier Guardians of the Galaxy or even the original Avengers -- it doesnt transcend its boundaries. Fans of the franchise will be pleased but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches.This is a bit of a surprise considering that Joss Whedon who made The Avengers is still in charge as director and writer. Hes known for his clever twists on pop-culture tropes ( Buffy the Vampire Slayer an updating of Much Ado About Nothing). But Age of Ultron seems to be made by numbers even if they are occasionally entertaining numbers.This time around our heroes find themselves battling a villain of their own creation. Actually Ultron is the creation of one of them master inventor Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.). He has made this new entity/program to help protect the Earth but as is usually the case when movies cross paths with artificial intelligence things dont go as planned. Ultron (voiced with both charm and evil by James Spader) takes on a physical robot body puts together a vengeful robot army and vows to rid the planet of those dastardly humans because thats the only way to save the planet.Obviously its up to the Avengers -- Thor (Chris Hemsworth) Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Bruce Banner/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) -- to save the day. They are helped by a couple of newbies -- Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and sister Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) -- who start off as enemies of the Avengers working for the odious Hydra organization (and the two are more intriguing as villains than heroes).Whats most interesting for Avengers followers is the deepening of the superheroes relationships and motivations. Theres the blossoming romance between Black Widow and Hulk Iron Mans questioning of the Avengers future (hence his desire to create something like Ultron) and Hawkeyes rural family life.And yes there are some genuinely funny moments as when theyre all sitting around talking about why despite all their superpowers Thor is the only one who can lift his hammer. Or when Iron Man complains ""Ive had a long day. Eugene ONeill long.""Also fans will be glad to see brief appearances from Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) James Rhodes/War Machine (Don Cheadle) Vision (Paul Bettany) and Sam Wilson/The Falcon (Anthony Mackie). Of course there are several showstopping special-effects set pieces including a Hulk rage explosion in Johannesburg and a final showdown in a fictional Eastern European country called Sokovia.Though they have their impressive elements these celebrations of CGI go on far too long and weigh the movie down with all the force of Thors hammer.For now this is Whedons last directorial go-round with the Avengers movies. He has gone on record as saying hes exhausted and that this is the hardest work he has done. The Russo brothers Anthony and Joe who did so well with Winter Soldier will helm the next chapter Avengers Infinity War Part 1 due in 2018.Maybe just maybe they will be able to breathe some new life into the formula.

"Avengers Age of Ultron - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Avengers Age of Ultron Posted by Christy Lemire on May 3 2015 66 Comments Walt Disney Pictures Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi action violence and destruction and for some suggestive comments. Running time 141 minutes. Two stars out of four. Much of what made Joss Whedons original ""Avengers"" such a joy in 2012 was his ability to juggle and make it look effortless. As writer and director he combined spectacular set pieces and small clever moments deftly and found a way to give every member of his large star-studded cast an opportunity to shine. It was a summer blockbuster with a sly sense of humor -- the most dazzling high-wire act -- and one that would be tough to top. Whedon follows up that smash hit with the latest installment in the behemoth Marvel Cinematic Universe ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" and this time the effort is obvious. There is simply too much going on here -- too many characters too many foes too many subplots too many twists. More does not necessarily equal better; here more is just ... meh. Its often hard to figure out whats going on and even harder to care but whatever is happening its brought to you by Audi (when its not brought to you by Gillette or Beats by Dre). Here and there Whedon -- the groundbreaking genre-blending creator of the TV series ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Firefly"" -- sneaks in glimmers of the snap and wit which have made him a major cultural force. Iron Man makes an aside about Eugene ONeill for example which Im guessing the vast majority of the giddy international audience wont get. When ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" takes a moment to catch its breath and allow the talented ensemble of actors to bounce off each other with self-aware smarts and charm its thoroughly winning. Theres a party scene at Tony Starks glassy lair in the sky which is just a complete blast to watch. Dressed in their civvies the Avengers drink and joke with their friends and bust each others chops. An amusing bit involving Thors hammer has an amazing payoff later on in the film. Its enough to make you wish the entire movie could be like this Imagine the Avengers sitting around bantering rather than blasting bad guys. Whedon did a stripped-down modern-day version of ""Much Ado About Nothing"" in his backyard so why not? But alas bad guys come. And there are so many of them. Were dropped in at the top in the midst of a massive siege on a fortress in some made-up Eastern European country. The camerawork is smooth and the stunts are tricky and the action is punishing but its all so big and glossy -- and so obviously computer-generated -- that it establishes an emotional disconnect from the very beginning. Yes the characters originated in comic books but this just looks cartoonish. Having saved the planet from the smarmy preening Loki and his army of aliens the Avengers must assemble once again to stop an accidental enemy an artificial intelligence that Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) himself designed. His name is Ultron and hes voiced with bemused menace by James Spader. (In an intriguing switch of their relationship in ""Less Than Zero"" Downey is the one in control and Spader is the one causing damage.) The introduction of A.I. and its benefits causes an ethical divide among the Avengers Captain America (Chris Evans) Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) Thor (Chris Hemsworth) Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). Various supporting players from previous Marvel movies also show up briefly including Cobie Smulders Samuel L. Jackson Stellan Skarsgard Hayley Atwell and Idris Elba. But wait theres more Besides the threat of Ultron the Avengers also must manage a pair of genetically enhanced twins who have a score to settle with Tony Stark the speedy Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and the psychic Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). With the exception of a couple of pivotal moments they werent terribly necessary for the plot. Theyre also doing terrible Eastern European accents that suggest theyd rather be hunting moose and squirrel. Ultron also uses a super-strong metal -- the same kind that comprises Captain Americas shield -- to form a army of mini-Ultrons so thats a problem too. It all feels frenzied and breathless but Whedons attempts at jamming in humanity end up seeming half-baked in contrast. Hawkeye gets an actual back story (as well as one great speech he delivers to Scarlet Witch in a reminder of the subtle strength of Renners acting abilities) but its more of an idyllic idea than a real life. Also hard to accept is the will-they-or-wont-they romance that forms between Hulk and Black Widow. Even with accomplished actors like Ruffalo and Johansson -- both of whom are capable of great power and great sensitivity -- this new-found relationship comes out of nowhere and makes no sense. If the high-tech issues ""Age of Ultron"" tackles interest you though there is a movie out there about the merits and threats of artificial intelligence which features tremendous performances and sharp writing and vivid special effects but about one one-hundredth of the cast Its called Ex Machina. Its one of the years best and a shining example of how less truly can be more.

(Bullwinkle reference) Love it. Reply May 5 2015  by  js     This was a thoroughly underwhelming film. My expectations were that it would entertain. I think thats fair to expect. I would be happy with ""Thor"" level of entertainment. Not asking too much. It didnt come close. On several occasions I found myself being jarred out of my suspension of disbelief so abruptly I let out audible ""ugh""s. There were moments where my mind began to wander wondering if Whedon wrote certain scenes with the trailer in mind because they made no sense in the context of the film (Thor- just about every scene he was in). The Avengers was not a perfect movie but I didnt expect it to be. It was however extremely fun to watch. Age of Ultron made me feel angry with myself for ever getting enthused about its release. Reply May 8 2015  by  Tashtego     Youve summed up my feelings on the film exactly. Reply May 3 2015  by  Chase     I say ""meh"" too. You hit the nail... Im suremany will be outraged at this but the truth does that. Reply May 12 2015  by  lol     The truth of your subjective view? Why would someone be so out of touch with reality like yourself to believe people consider your own subjective opinion of the movie as universal truth? Many would be outraged not at your opinion but the truth that do not understand subjective =/= objective .. and are wasting their oxygen. Reply May 3 2015  by  Jon     You suck this movie is amazing Reply May 8 2015  by  Shawn     Yay Agreed I honestly dont get all the hate. The film manages to give you everything you want in a smart clever way and there are literally no other villains than Ultron-the twins exists but are directionless until his arrival. Im confused by those who are confused by this amazing flick. Reply May 3 2015  by  dwayne strickland     Sigh. You clearly missed the entire point of the movie. They had a lot to pack into the movie to further the larger scheme of things. It wasnt like spiderman 3 where it was like lets throw everything at them just because. This was intentional it was needed to bring us into phase 3 and it was done beautifully. Everything had a purpose nothing was superfluous. It was genious. The only flaw was it was obviously too intelligent for some critics to follow. Everyone go see this movie. Its awesome. Period. Reply May 3 2015  by  David     Ha. Ha. ""It was obviously too intelligent for some critics to follow"". Ha. I can see youre clearly a fan boy but that line was just ridiculous. It wasnt a matter of intelligence that created the films inability to be followed it was the fact that it was overstuffed poorly edited and extremely rushed. Your entire argument that its brilliant because of all its setting up for phase 3 is entirely invalid. That in fact was its biggest problem; it worried so much about setting up future events that it was unable to make the events in the film worth caring about (or following for that matter). Ive got a feeling even Joss would agree considering the displeasure hes expressed working with Disney/Marvel on this one. Reply May 8 2015  by  CNA     But the movie wasnt hard to follow. I had no trouble. My wife whos not into comic books had no trouble. If it was ""too hard for you to follow"" well that says more about you than about Whedon. Reply May 4 2015  by  xander     Right back at you with that sigh. If you thought that movie was awesome you have limited taste. Reply May 4 2015  by  Steve Butabi     Limited taste? It was a summer action blockbuster. RT has it at 75% from ""critics"" and 90% from fans. Looks like the majority consensus is that most of the world have liked it. Also look at how much money it has already made. Something tells me you wear a fedora and probably have a neck beard... Reply May 6 2015  by  xander     I love many superhero movies. Many. But not all. Apparently you judge things based solely on dollars earned and the masses that are apparently appeased. Are you not capable of thought that is independent from the masses? If ""money making"" is your only criteria then Mayweather/Pacquiao was the best fight of all time and One Direction blows away some of the greatest rock bands in the world. Your arguments are foolish coming from someone with a simplistic follower mentality. (""Oh look It made money Its AWESOME"") Argue the MOVIE not the box office. Do you know how many things of low quality make a ton of money? Apparently not Are all blockbusters good? That IS what you are arguing -- and that is the opposite of intelligent. And I dont have fedora. A neck beard well sometimes ... so you got me there Reply May 9 2015  by  Podcast on Infinite Earths     Out of curiosity what were your specific issues with the movie? May 12 2015  by  lol     Even better is this guy couldnt explain his taste because someone else would just come along and crap on it. Another tool who thinks subjective opinions are universal. Reply May 4 2015  by  ccdev     i tried to watch AvengersAOU again to see what the fanboys saw that i did not. well not only did the 2nd viewing confirm my original feelings (the movie was shit) but i noticed a ""cowboy circling the wagons"" theme where the Avengers formed a circle to protect the drill-thingy or whatever the fuck it was. and the ultron bots were playing the role of the injuns LOL and how stupid can Ultron get? even baron strucker knew to target the weakest first. in a circle that would have been widow n hawkeye. that and so many illogical stuff i dont wanna waste time talking about really stood out to relegate this movie to level of ""disposable nice-looking junk"" movie. and with the hawkeye-family emotional angle shtick well he just made Hawkeye the fast living archer/assasin.... boring. If however youre a pimply-faced attention-deficit gadget-needy emo teen youd probably go Its the BEST movie evah or ""Best marvel movie to date"" or ""Absolutely gripping the action was like ...Woohhhh"" due to the ""CGI-orgy amp; Loud Sound"" + light one-liners combo given to you courtesy of joss overated whedon. and the pitiful attempts at humor got really tiring. I can tell you straight up that the old-gang of Donald Duck And Goofy amp; pluto was a lot funnier. But the worse was the action...nowhere did you feel like the major characters were in danger nowhere. it was just all ""sound and color - ""pow pewwpeew bish thudd..."". there is no weight to the fights just some choreography and fancy editing. And the action was so often chaotic inconsequential (like Cap took a couple of point blank shots from Ultron and was hardly fazed wtf) amp; so quickly cut u mostly couldnt tell what was going on. its was like mixing different flakes of color and just shaking it around. Overall this ""marvel"" movie made me feel like i was in a carnival and that i overstayed and my brain ate wayway too much candy floss. MARVEL movies as it stands is synonymous with lightheartedcolorful heavy fluff. a comic book fan deserves much more than this piece of fluff. Reply May 5 2015  by  Steve Butabi     umadbro? Reply May 6 2015  by  xander     Youre right. And Im a fanboy I guess. But this was a mess. Reply May 12 2015  by  lol     You shouldnt mouth breath so loudly its rude. Reply May 23 2015  by  Brian     Anyone notice when the thing with the red face was asked who he is he replied I am( then paused ) I am. Thats basically what Jesus said. That is blasphemy . Reply May 3 2015  by  Asif Quader     I had really high expectations for this movie. Unfortunately felt that it was a let down compared to the first one. There were so many plots and subplots that at the end felt like a mess where you didnt care much about what was going on. In an attempt to squeeze too much information in 2.5 hours the end product was not satisfying. The box office numbers also reflect the same issue. Reply May 3 2015  by  jeff conn     This movie was horriblepredictable and lame i would never pay a ticket to watch garbage. i watched illegally online as should be Reply May 4 2015  by  thomas     This is because you are a girl who watches because of a boyfriend or work and are missing the whole point... Reply May 4 2015  by  ccdev     thank the pirates. marvel = mcdonalds Reply May 5 2015  by  Chris     eyeroll What a lame comment with no examples to even back up your simpleton post in regards to it. You obviously dont follow the movies and to top it off you openly admit to watching it illegally. Look out everyone we have a regular Einstein on our hands here... Reply May 12 2015  by  lol     Oh wow nobody has ever done that before Columbus. Reply May 3 2015  by  Firevine     Ive been a huge comic book fan for over 20 years now Marvel in particular and this is the first Marvel Studios movie that has left me feeling ""meh"" as well. I found the editing sloppy and the character deaths superfluous. I shouldnt be walking out of the theater wondering what on earth happened to a relatively minor but very long standing and pretty cool Marvel villain. Cap 2 had a resolution for Batroc but Avengers 2 had no such resolution for Klaw. Why did Hulk get dumbed down so much since the first movie? He exhibited a bit of control and had dialogue in the that one here he was more like the Hulk of the 60s comics. Just a dumb brute. The party scene was fantastic and definitely did what Marvel does best in making their characters personable and relatable. Ive tried many a Joss Whedon vehicle over the years but honestly I think hes awful and that the first Avengers movie was a fluke. Now with all that said the utter worst part of the viewing at my local theater was the Batman vs. Superman trailer. That looks to be a real stinker. Reply May 4 2015  by  Steve Butabi     I suggest you watch Firefly Serenity and Cabin in the Woods if you think he is awful. If you have and still think that then there is no helping you. Reply May 4 2015  by  ccdev     cabin in the woods? LOL better go order your mcdonalds super size stuff. Reply May 5 2015  by  Steve Butabi     Cause that makes a lot of sense. Reply May 3 2015  by  Brent     just goes to show you you can be a critic and have no taste get a different job as this one dose not suit you at all Reply May 4 2015  by  xander     Brent if youre going to criticize the critic learn to punctuate and spell. It can give more weight to your opinions and not make your views seem sophomoric. As it is youre wrong. She hit it on the head as they say. Reply May 4 2015  by  Steve Butabi     No she was far off from ""hitting it on the head."" I initially stopped readying at ""Its enough to make you wish the entire movie could be like this Imagine the Avengers sitting around bantering rather than blasting bad guys"" because no one went to the theater to see an Avengers movie without action. Was it a nice part in the movie? Yes but if you were looking for something like that then dont go so see this movie. This movie was a great summer action movie that has been building up for years. Her review is absolute garbage and proves she has no idea what was going on because she probably handt seen the other great MCU movies. Reply May 4 2015  by  ccdev     ohh another butthurt fanboy. Reply May 5 2015  by  Steve Butabi     How exactly am I ""butthurt?"" Her review clearly shows she has no idea what is going on in the MCU. I guess you could say Im ""butthurt"" because this movie is a huge critical and financial success. MAN I DONT WANT TO SEE ANOTHER SUMMER ACTION MARVEL MOVIE. NOOOOO Go troll somewhere else kid. May 6 2015  by  xander     If you stopped READYING as you said how do you know her review was garbage? And just because something has been building up for years it doesnt make it great. Star Wars one two and three were building up for years too. Hardly great. Calling the review absolute garbage is pretty funny because I think you stopped reading it. And if you didnt you still missed the the OTHER words in the review which were well thought out and obviously considered. Theres a reason she has her job and you have yours. Not that all critics are good but she is even when I disagree with her. Reply May 12 2015  by  lol     White knight riding in on the holier than thou horse. Epic. Reply May 3 2015  by  Andrew     Thanks for an insightful review. I didnt agree with all of it but you did a better job than I ever could conveying why I felt ill at ease about a lot of it. (Action was so frantic it was difficult to make out what was going on plot just didnt make sense at times too many villains meant the stakes were LOWER and Hulk/Scarlet Witch romance was tiresome clunky clumsy and dragged down the story in general.) But I liked exactly what you liked too Hawkeyes interaction with Scarlet Witch was charming. More self-aware humor could have made this a real winner. Reply May 4 2015  by  Steve Butabi     No wonder why it didnt make sense to you (dont know why people couldnt keep up - wasnt a confusing movie) you dont even know who was who. Black Widow and Hulk not Scarlet Witch. Reply May 4 2015  by  brent     what i meant to say was Yes this avengers 2 movie was stupid. why did they call it Age of Ultron when he was causing havoc for only 2 days. haha this movie was rushed and sloppy and edited so badly. I fell asleep twice then realized watching golf was way better than this crap Reply May 4 2015  by  Steve Butabi     Because had he succeed and wiped out all the humans it would have been the age of Ultron or robots/AI like Ultron is. Use your brain a little - the movie wasnt confusing at all especially if you have seen the other MCU movies. Reply May 4 2015  by  selwyn     I think the flaw of Avengers AOU is that it takes more than a single viewing to really enjoy the film. Like many viewers here i came out of it feeling ""meh"" at first. But then I watched it a second time (because I forgot that I had committed to watch it with a few other friends) and I came out thinking whoa now i really enjoyed this movie Watched it for a third time with my mum (she had no one to watch it with since my dad had work to do) and I realise how much of a genius Joss Whedon is. 2 hours and 20 minutes really was not enough time for a normal viewers brain to register all small nuances in this movie that actually made it an excellent one far deeper than the first instalment of the Avengers. The second flaw of this movie is that it takes someone who is well-absorbed in the universe and has a smattering of knowledge of the comic book lore to truly enjoy the film for all it was worth. How did the Avengers get back together? watch Agents of Shield. What was the big deal about all those stones and that end credits scene? Watch the previous marvel movies. What in the world was the ""Water of Sight"" that Thor submerged himself in? Unclear but it could be the Well of Wyrd. Why did Vision appear out of nowhere to save Scarlet Witch? Ultrons subtle soft spot for Scarlet Witch probably transferred onto Vision and we know what happens between the latter 2 in the comics.. And tons of other small details that makes it difficult to follow for the standalone movie viewer. I think Joss Whedon already did a magnificent job compressing all those plot points into 142 minutes but I think the movie would have been a lot better fleshed-out if it were 3 and a half hours long (impossible for the sake of profit-maximisation though itd make a lot of sense if extra scenes were put in DVD/Blu-ray for an extended complete version). As a first-time viewer I would have given the movie a 6.5/10 but as a third-time viewer this movie goes onto my list of rare 9.5/10. Reply May 4 2015  by  William     Have you wondered why every comic book fan actually liked the movie even though you did not? It is because in comics more than one plot and more than one character can be seen and read about. What you see as a bad thing because you do not have the capability to pay attention to more than a few characters smarter people see as a great thing. Reply May 4 2015  by  drew     Dont be an asshole William.You dont have to agree with the review but being a holier than thou fan boy doesnt help your argument. Reply May 12 2015  by  lol     Whaaaaaiiiiitttttee Kniiiigggggghhhttttt Reply May 4 2015  by  Roger     Good to know Im not completely alone. I wasnt impressed with the film either. It wasnt bad but it wasnt good either mainly for most of the reasons that were stated here. Reply May 4 2015  by  Lafe Purcell     This movie hopes to highlight the fact humanity posed by sheer stupidity. Honestly when I read where somebody above actually cited this movie as being ""too intelligent"" for some people I immediately started looking for a cyanide capsule. That ANYONE could describe the movie as too intelligent for even a cage full of educationally challenged chimpanzees is frightening in its implications. I wont pass on the merits or failings of this overstuffed action cartoon other than to say it entertained - barely. Other than that I find myself grieving the fact that Ultron didnt pull out a win. Reply May 4 2015  by  ccdev     This movie was cgi shat on to your faces. hope you ladies enjoyed it. Reply May 5 2015  by  willie     For those whove watched the movie how does it compare to the original Avengers movie? Better worse about the same? Reply May 5 2015  by  Doug     I think you had your expectations set to high. No one can make another ""Empire Strikes Back"" in terms of a sequel. This movie was a setup movie to the big finish for Avengers 3 Pt1amp;2. I wasnt expecting this movie to surpass the original. I came to this movie on wanting to see how they rally everyone together and the flaws they exhibit and work past them.Plus how they were going to work the ultron angle and vision. I could do without the romance angle in the movie but overall this movie is better then 2 Stars. Reply May 5 2015  by  Burakiosaurus     It was a fun action movie. Didnt get some of the references as I dont read the comics but understood most of it. Lots of in jokes must of happened as the cinema was sniggering when I was just thinking WTF ? I preferred the first movie but will gladly go and see the next instalment in the cinemas again Reply May 5 2015  by  haarry     You like a lot of the same movies I do so I look forward to reading your reviews. I cant take characters with cheesy eurotrash accents seiously either nobody talks like that not even real erotrash. Reply May 6 2015  by  Roger     I would prefer if professional writers did not use ""meh"". Reply May 6 2015  by  harry     These Avenger movies are so dumb. The acting is weak the plots are stupid the CGI gets tedious after a while. Fans of these movies are a bunch of whiney babies whenever someone dares to give an unfavorable opinion of them but thats to be expected from adults who watch movies made for children. Reply May 11 2015  by  Miles     I happen to be 56 and have seen more movies than you can even imagine ( theatre manager and video store owner since the 1970s). I could care less if you or the reviewer like it. I certainly will not insult you for having a different opinion or make a ridiculous broad generalization that would be rather childish wouldnt it? You denigrate fan boys for doing something and then turn around and do the exact same thing. Theres a word of that. Reply May 7 2015  by  Frank     I think many people were expecting too much from this film. Its a summer action flick about comic book characters. Im just not sure what level of depth people really thought they were in for. LOL I didnt find the plot to be confusing at all but I did see many of the subplots as unnecessary and a few were just counter productive to the overall story. As for the comedy.... a lot of that felt extremely cliche for me. Watching people playfully banter as they do superhuman things in supposedly dangerous situations is so overused and it takes all the tension away from those situations. I did think the bit about Thors hammer was more fun than those other scenes. Also the review stated ""Ultron also uses a super-strong metal -- the same kind that comprises Captain Americas shield -- to form a army of mini-Ultrons so thats a problem too."" SPOILERS AHEAD Im pretty sure thats incorrect. The metal is rare and wasnt available in that quantity. He used the vibranium to construct a body for himself. But the body was used by Vision instead. He then used the remaining vibranium to build the machine which lifted the city. His army seemed to be constructed of more conventional materials. You may want to correct that Christy.  But nice review Reply May 7 2015  by  Jonathan     Christy I kinda get where you are coming from but this is a team movie. How can there be too many characters when there were really only 1 or two more than the first Avengers? Colson is gone Fury Selvig and Hill are relegated to glorified cameos Loki is no where to be seen... you simply add one villain and two wildcards after taking those away and give Jarvis an upgrade so I fail to see how that is too many characters. If this was a stand alone film maybe. But its a team film and I thought it was balanced really well. Reply May 7 2015  by  D.     Thank you for the review. Reply May 9 2015  by  eric hunter     First off you are beautiful Christy Lemire - keep up the good work. Always like reading your reviews as they are honest and well written. Liked your review I thought the motorcycle jump with Captain America was so cartoonish along with most of the movie. The end was the same as the first smash a bunch of evil invading enemies. Nothing new to really expect. Some good scenes with the hulk. Its funny how fans are so protective over a fictional movie even Jeremy Renner said on Conan Show that he called Black Widow a slot for sleeping with many of the avengers in the comic books and fans were attacking him on his twitter Jeremy said the movie is fictional. I do like Jeremys acting especially in Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol hope he is in the new one coming out. Reply May 12 2015  by  lol     Too cartoonish for a comic book movie.. People are so odd. Reply May 12 2015  by  David     First I love Marvel characters and movies however I didnt really enjoy this movie as I had high expectations. I loved the first Avengers movie. I grew up loving the Marvel characters and what they stood for. What I didnt like about this movie as they introduced so many characters that we didnt have time to understand or appreciate them or see them evolve (or learn). I knew a lot about these characters going in but probably not as much as Marvel comic reading experts. An example was Quicksilver. His life is dedicated to going after Stark although he expressed no anger when meeting Stark and changes sides very quickly. Even though he was a nice ally why did he feel compelled to save people all of the sudden? I found confusing is who is the real leader of the Avengers? Is it Stark or Capn? Most of the characters have egos and their own issues but who is holding them together? Who do they respect enough to listen to. At least we know where Capn stands because his character has been developed in other movies. But let his old school values be the glue that holds the team together. Lets see Tony use his brilliance to figure out an impossible puzzle or outsmart Ultron. We all see their wonderful abilities but they need to fight villains with equal abilities and let their inside moral strength propel them to victory. The Iron Man and Hulk fight scene was wonderful and there were also cool things added like using Thors hammer and Caps shield as a kind of a vibration weapon. So yes there were some really nice effects and fight scenes. However most of this movie was talking and didnt have much substance. I did like seeing Vision in this movie knowing he would be an awesome ally. But he didnt have much time to show his abilities and probably could have taken care of Ultron himself. Bruce Banner should also be evolving in this movie as well. Each movie we see him control the Hulk better but somehow devolved in this movie. I would have preferred to see more War Machine and/or Blank Panther. But again we have too many people packed in here already. I also agree with the review that the story line could have been streamlined and simplified. There was just too much going on that wasnt necessary. Essentially I feel we have some amazing characters that I really want to see why and how the grow to respect each other and work as a team. Also I would like to feel the villains are a force to be reckoned with. I hope this movie does lead us the a great 3rd installment. Reply May 13 2015  by  Pyapiopi     While I enjoyed your small review I just want to point out a few things that may make you go ""hmm well that changes things a little"". 1. Quicksilver and scarlet witch. There is one line in the movie that if you dont process or just glance over it you miss their motives and reasoning completely. Cap at one point says ""ya what kind of man lets a German scientist experiment on him to protect his country."" While a jab at himself (because thats what he did) it also explains the twins. They suffered a awful loss at a young age and to them it was because of Stark. And for the longest time he was their enemy and Ultron led them to believe (without intent to) that he would save the earth from these ""villains"". Also to note these twins shared a bond almost on a psychic level. Hence why when quicksilver died scarlet witch let out a scream and abandoned the missions to go after Ultron. So when she saw what Ultron actually intended to do and how he was the true villain that must mean the avengers are actually the good guys. 2. The hulk. You claim he ""devolved"" in this one but the ending is a clear indication that is 100% false. The hulk is clearly in control enough to be a good guy hence the opening scene. So he never lost any control. But dont let the fact that he needs to be calmed down to turn back a indication of devolution. We just never saw that transition in Avengers so without thinking about it you may not realize that he is now in more control then ever. 3. Ultron. Yep he was portrayed as kind of weak. Not really weak but compared to comic counter part? Definitely. I mean he went toe to toe with Thor with vision and was defeating cap and tony. He surely wasnt weak. But the true threat wasnt Ultron but his plan. One of the most beautiful scenes to express this was the ""defend the button"" scene. Ultron wasnt the mission. Making sure this city doesnt drop and wipe humanity is the most important thing. The whole final action scene was stark and cap battling how to save not only the world but not sacrifice thousands to do it. Until shield came it was a losing battle. Reply May 12 2015  by  lol     Your review is meh not the movie. Reply May 15 2015  by  Lucas Romeri     Totally agree Christy. Id go so far as to say that this movie was terrible and one of the worst films of 2015 so far. Dont even give the Marvel fanboys trolling you in the comments the time of day- hopefully they will grow up someday. Great review Reply August 28 2015  by  Wilmer Begaye     Agreed. The first Avengers is amazing. But AOU was thoroughly boring to me. Glad it has its fan base but I was let down too. I expected it to be better than the first and FOR ME it was not. What was most annoying was James Spaders Ultron that seemed goofy just like Tom Hardys Bane. Nothing frightening or interesting about those villains at all. Just my 2 cents.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size Christopher Orr May 1 2015 Film When Joss Whedon set out to make his first Avengers movie the task seemed an unprecedented pop-cultural juggling act Bring together heroes from four separate Marvel franchises with very different aesthetics--from World War II pulp to extraterrestrial Nordic polytheism--add in an overarching storyline about the spy organization SHIELD (along with a half-dozen affiliated characters) and try desperately not to fall flat on your face. Against all probability Whedon utterly triumphed producing an action mega-blockbuster with the soul of a drawing-room comedy.Related Story The Astonishing Avengers For Avengers Age of Ultron that already ridiculous challenge has been upped exponentially. In addition to all the above the movie throws into the mix four new major characters (Ultron Scarlet Witch Quicksilver and the Vision); all of their respective origin stories; cameos of various sizes by fellow Marvel personalities War Machine Falcon Peggy Carter Heimdall and Erik Selvig; and the ever-heavier burden of serving as a bridge between all the Marvel movies that have been made to date and all those yet to come. (Hello Black Panthers Wakanda) Its the cinematic equivalent of juggling chainsaws while riding a unicycle. On a tightrope. Across the Grand Canyon.To say that Whedon succeeds only in part scarcely counts as a criticism. (To belabor the metaphor He may have dropped a chainsaw or two but he got across safely.) Age of Ultron is a strong opener for the summer blockbuster season; its just not a mind-blowing quasi-revelation like its predecessor. The sharp interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy inevitable need to Save the World.The story begins where it left off. Not at the end of the previous Avengers mind you--that would be too straightforward--but at the end of last years Captain America The Winter Soldier. Having located the wooded alpine lair of Hydra commander Baron von Strucker (Thomas Kretschmann) the Avengers proceed to assault it. Therein they find both Lokis scepter and a pair of decidedly unfriendly super-powered twins Pietro and Wanda Maximoff played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen respectively. (The super-monikers are never used but yes these are Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch.)Upon returning the scepter to the Avengers spiffy Manhattan HQ Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) proceed to examine the gemstone embedded in it. This stone (Marvel fans will long since have deduced its identity) leads them to a breakthrough in artificial intelligence enabling the creation of a Stark pet project the ""Ultron"" program robotic peacekeepers who can do the Avengers job for them when they are otherwise engaged. Not that Stark and Banner bother to tell anyone else about their little breakthrough. ""I dont want to hear the man was not meant to meddle medley"" Stark explains. ""Peace in our time--imagine that.""Alas peace never gets much beyond the imagination stage. No sooner does Ultron (voiced by James Spader) awake than he goes all Modern Prometheus on the gang in the process breaking up a perfectly good house party destroying Starks butler/operating system Jarvis (Paul Bettany) and announcing with Spaderian relish his intent to eradicate humanity. Oops.An awful lot of the final act revolves around the rescue of nameless Sokovians.From there the movie proceeds largely as one might expect. Ultron creates an army of metal Mini-Mes and recruits the Maximoff twins to his cause. Wanda a telepath messes with the Avengers minds--to particularly dramatic effect with Banner/Hulk--and Pietro runs circles around them though never alas to the tune of Jim Croces ""Time in a Bottle."" The Avengers crisscross the globe--East Africa Oslo Seoul--in pursuit of their new nemesis. Along the way Captain America (Chris Evans) polices his teammates foul language Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) tries to make us forget that she had a much better haircut in Winter Soldier Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) reveals a Dark Secret and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) flexes his steroidal-Shakespearean biceps. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) makes a dramatic entrance or two.There are of course several action sequences in which the Avengers fight with Ultron with the Maximoffs and among themselves. These all culminate in a long final showdown back in Sokovia the same fictional Eastern European nation where the movie began at Struckers lair. I confess that its here that Age of Ultron began to lose me. The battle with an army of innumerable CGI opponents felt altogether too familiar even if this time Whedon exchanged aliens for robots. Moreover one of the advantages Marvel has always held over DC Comics is that its more typically set in the real world (e.g. New York City over Metropolis) and try as I might I found it hard to get terribly worked up about the fate of Sokovia. And while I genuinely appreciate Joss Whedons sentiments on reducing collateral civilian damage an awful lot of the final act revolves around the rescue of nameless line-less interchangeable Sokovians. Give me a skeptical NYPD sergeant won over by Caps heroics any day.Theres plenty to like in Age of Ultron. The dialogue is sharp and the actors mostly hit their marks--Taylor-Johnson and Olsens tongue-y accents notwithstanding. A series of gags about Thors hammer is a particular pleasure and theres an unexpected soulfulness to Bettanys rebirth as the Vision. But the hectic demands of so many character introductions and plot twists and battle sequences and Marvel tie-ins inevitably crowd such moments to the margins. A playful romance between Black Widow and Banner never quite catches fire and Hawkeyes humanizing backstory feels half-hearted. Theres simply too much going on Age of Ultron covers far more ground in two and a half hours than Marvels recent Netflix series Daredevil did in thirteen.After shooting the first Avengers Whedon said his ""detox"" was the unassuming black-and-white adaptation of Much Ado About Nothing that he shot at his own house during a two-week ""vacation"" from post-production. By the time it finally winds into its conclusion Age of Ultron feels as if its in need of a detox of its own or at least a mild purge of some sort. Its telling that the single loosest most entertaining sequence in the entire film is the wisecracking party at Avengers HQ before Ultron even shows up. Which raises the heretical thoughts What if the villain had never shown up? What if the world didnt need saving at all? What if the movie had dared to offer less ""ado"" and more ""nothing""?

But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side.

The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting.

I wish he and his wife didnt have to stand there as the parents of a 27-year-old Army captain who was killed by suicide bombers while serving in the Iraq War. And I wish Khizr Khan hadnt felt the need to declare his patriotism and loyalty to the United States of America. Those truths should have been self-evident. The state of the union is not strong when an American feels compelled to clarify such things. In better times Khizr Khan who was born in Pakistan and moved to America from the United Arab Emirates might have begun his speech with what he said next ""Like many immigrants we came to this country empty-handed. We believed in American democracy--that with hard work and [the] goodness of this country we could share in and contribute to its blessings.""

James Fallows None Mark Salter former chief of staff to Sen. John McCain has written an essay for Real Clear Politics on why he cannot vote for Donald Trump. It deserves note for the long-term record because this is not how associates of a partys former nominee usually talk about the current one and because of its insistence on the importance of tax returns. Salter concludes (emphasis added) Could it be that a major party nominee for president is beholden to Russias leader and might compromise the security interests of the U.S. and our allies to maintain that relationship?  We dont know the answer.... We cant begin to answer the question until Trump releases his tax returns for the last several years. The media should make this the focus of every interview with Trump and senior Trump staff. The Republican Party chairman should urge him to release his returns. The Republican leadership in Congress should insist on it. Every American voter should demand it. There are legitimate suspicions about whether Trumps business relationships could compromise his loyalty to our country. Unless and until he puts them to rest not by dismissing them but by disproving them he should be considered unfit to hold the office of president.

Hillary Clinton is out of the frying pan and into the fire. On July 6 Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that the Justice Department would not pursue criminal charges against the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee for her use of a private email server at the State Department. But the following day with that criminal investigation closed the State Department reopened its own probe into the emails the AP reported. State Department spokesman John Kirby told the AP that it would be looking at potential mishandling of classified information by Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Former officials could face administrative sanctions including a loss of their security clearances--a step that would be both politically embarrassing for Clinton and complicate efforts to staff a national-security team should she prevail in November.

Most of the story and character background has already been established and theres the chance to delve deeper.This is certainly the case with ""Avengers Age of Ultron."" We already know the bulk of characters and how they came together their surface tensions and strengths. Now director-writer Joss Whedon has the opportunity to build relationships flesh out disappointments even look to what apparently is an uneven future.Not that this movie isnt the expected huge barrel of noise and fireworks. It starts out running in battle and rarely slows down. But slow down it does not with the long dead spots that marred the original ""Avengers"" film but with well-chosen interludes that offer a glimpse into each major characters struggles and individual lives.Its hardly a long-winded therapy session -- Hulk still Smash plenty -- but the human touches make for a far better superhero experience.Now as to that superhero thing. There are even more of them this time around so many that Whedon has a tough time squeezing them all into his patented circling-round-the chaos shots. But squeeze he does even as he continues to drop one liners and physical jokes into the mayhem.Things start out in the fictional country Sokovia where the Avengers are storming the fortress of Hydra the Nazi organization left over from the Captain America movies. They win the day of course but cant capture two super-villains there -- the twins Pietro Maximof (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) who is called Quicksilver because hes super-fast and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) called Scarlet Witch because ... well she can really mess with things including peoples heads.The twins were orphaned when Stark Industry bombs hit their home so they hate Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) otherwise known as Iron Man and the other Avengers by association. This becomes more important when Stark decides to invent a guardian to protect mankind and instead ends up with a renegade artificially intelligent super-robot named Ultron (a perfect James Spader) who also makes the Avengers his sworn enemies.Meanwhile Captain America (Chris Evans) is starting to realize hell never live anything like a normal life; Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson) finds herself falling for Bruce Banner (Mark Rufffalo) who has the fortunate/unfortunate habit of turning into the Hulk; and a very different side of Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) is revealed. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) pretty much remains his muscle-bound Norse God self.Sound like a lot of characters? We havent even gotten to the coolest newcomer the Vision (Paul Bettany who has long played Iron Mans accomplice Jarvis). And of course theres Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) his wingwoman Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) Iron Mans cohort War Machine (Don Cheadle) and all sorts of folks who show up in flashbacks (Julie Delpy is in this movie. Julie Delpy)If that seems more like a phone book than a cast of characters the sheer bulk of bodies makes the momentum here all the more impressive. There are a couple of times -- short-lived -- when everybody sort of calms down and shoots the breeze like regular folk offering welcome semi-normalcy. But for the most part ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" is the hard-charging mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for.

Age of Ultrons doting over Renner actually made me stop and ask whether something terrible had happened to him during the filming of this movie. The difference is that Walker was an integral part of his multibillion-dollar action franchise. Renners place in the Marvel Universe seems more expendable Hes a redshirt with magnificent arms. But Hawkeye is given prominence in a movie that lasts for two hours and 21 minutes and features more stars and characters than a 1970s disaster movie. Presumably these scenes of emergency rustication -- set amid the same signposts of beating-heart Americana you find in science fiction lately (Looper Transcendence Interstellar) -- are meant as a respite from the movies stockpile of chaotic spectacle. At the culmination of that mess in Africa Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) summons his best toys to quell a run-amok Hulk whos been placed along with the rest of the group under some kind of hallucinatory spell by the female half (Elizabeth Olsen) of a set of testy Eastern European twins. This sequence looks and feels as good as anything in the previous Avengers movie from 2012. Computer-generated images acquire bruising tonnage while also being vividly defined in a style that exhilaratingly approximates the experience of reading an actual comic book. Three years ago that verisimilitude was an achievement. Writer-director Joss Whedon and hundreds of technicians had improbably re-created the intangible thrill of illustrated action. Now after a dozen more superhero films a third of which serve as appetizers for this second installment you start to feel like youve eaten too much. This latest most overwhelming iteration of the Marvel blockbuster began in 2008 in mutual gluttony We wanted more superheroes as much as the studio did. Seven years later with movies and network shows and a streaming series (and comic books) I dont know when more is going to end. Will there be no subsequent stand-alone series that wont be co-opted for cross-promotion for synergy? At this point ""more"" has mutated into ""too much."" That ""too much"" has consolidated Hollywoods global hegemony so thoroughly that the impossible physics of perpetual motion has been achieved. But where does that leave these movies on a scene-to-scene basis? Cardellini draping herself over Renner for a couple of scenes as a cooldown between flare-ups encapsulates the lugubriousness that now has set in. With a bad issue of a comic book you can whip through shrug and hope for something better the next month. But these behemoth movies -- megabusters -- have to seem worth the bother. The genre is an economy unto itself too big to fail. (""Next month"" after all is more like two or three years away.) They have to seem busy and stuffed with action. Of course by packing in all of that action they risk excess. Not terribly far into Age of Ultron everyone sits around the Avengers headquarters in street clothes drinking and bantering. Don Cheadle is there as vice-Iron Man. So too is Cobie Smulderss agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. looking like an agent of Pan Am. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has placed his hammer on a table and a montage breaks out in which some of the boys try in vain to lift it. (Scarlett Johanssons Black Widow smells a pissing contest and chooses to hold her nose.) Chris Evanss Captain America makes a little headway inspiring Hemsworth to send us a flash of emasculative worry then fake certainty. The sharpening of Thors macho prissiness is mostly a thing. His size is a joke on his theater-geek insecurity. The previous Avengers installment gave Thor nothing to do. But the upgrade feels like as much the result of a mandate for ""more"" as everything else in this movie -- more plot more action more banter more villains more everything. When Smulders asks the men where Gwyneth Paltrow Natalie Portman and Hayley Atwell are you have to laugh. Has she seen the poster? Where would you put them? This is a movie ravenously greedy enough to be mistaken for a Nathans Hot Dog Eating Contest. As it is were beyond capacity. Officially Samuel L. Jackson reprises the long-running role of his now former S.H.I.E.L.D. muckety-muck Nick Fury. But all the expository yammering and grandfatherly uplift hes assigned to do should be making Morgan Freeman feel litigious. Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson play the Eastern European twins Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. Before inducing her latest nightmare she says ""Everybodys afraid of something."" Id start with those accents. Other actors visit this movie from the worlds of their ancillary Marvel titles Idris Elba (Thor) Stellan Skarsgaard (Thor) and Anthony Mackie (Captain America The Winter Soldier). There are parts as well -- crumbs actually -- for Julie Delpy Andy Serkis Claudia Kim Thomas Kretschmann and Paul Bettany whose character would be a welcome new addition in a less tightly packaged product and whose face is covered in cherry Kool-Aid. This movie doesnt need a director. It needs the fire marshal. For the record the director is once again Joss Whedon who also did the script. And once again he tries to impose some semblance of fun -- if not a sense of order. The opening minutes especially have the sort of glibness epitomized by Downey that cuts through the grandiosity of that long opening battle sequence set amid the trees and bunkers of someplace called Sokovia. Downey returns to his normal disrespectfulness but the increase in banter and one-liners gives so much of the movie the feeling of an awards show. Why should Downey always win every conversation? This still leave Evans as the butt of a castwide running gag. Even Smulders gets in a dig. In the plot of Age of Ultron -- one of them anyway -- Tony Stark a.k.a. Iron Man and Dr. Bruce Banner a.k.a. Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) use the artificial intelligence that Tony has discovered in a gem in a scepter1 to top off Stark Industriess new global security system called Ultron. Immediately Ultron whose baritone belongs to James Spader achieves evil A.I. sentience. (Its retrieval occasions the opening action sequence.) Ultron gathers sentience destroys Tonys previous A.I. and proceeds to plot a course for Ye Destruction of All Humankind. You can feel Whedon trying to justify the movies existence by giving the actors throwaway lines and little romances touches meant to amuse and humanize. This includes Spaders Ultron a villain who thinks and feels and begins putdowns with such things as ""I cant physically throw up in my mouth ..."" If he knew about the running Captain America joke hed have an eye roll for that too. Hearing Spader is a pleasure. He gives Downey a run for his money in the slickness department. But their wits cant disguise the familiarity of this enterprise. At some point Downey feels out a wall while incanting ""Please be a secret door please be a secret door please be a secret door."" Lo and behold ... By the time everyones at that farmhouse the movie feels as if its in a holding pattern. Whedon has misjudged how much these peoples lives mean to us now. It isnt that theres no room for the ordinary in one of these movies. Theres no place for the banal and banal is what that stretch at chez Hawkeye is. Unless Cardellini is turning into a wasp or a sorceress why really are we here? Whatever was special or new about the superhero movie in the early 2000s with the release of the first X-Men and Spider-Man movies has evaporated. Once upon a time we would have admired that opening sequence which climaxes with about five of the Avengers running from their respective battles into a single slow-motion shot as the state-of-the-art technical achievement it is. But now we feel about it the same way Tony Stark feels about that secret door. Its a cliche. World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. Its work. Grunt work. For them. For us. Halfway through this second helping I was thinking ahead to how little reason there would be for a third. I dont know that I care to watch Olsen wave her arms again until special effects shoot from her. But shell be there as will the handful of characters who pour into the movies finale with distressing eagerness. The movie wants to succeed on its own terms. But usually you dont know what those are. Often they feel like the marketplaces. Or the studios. This argument applies to many movies. But the marketplace is all you sense in Age of Ultron. Its not Whedons movie. Its capitalisms.

Film Frame/Marvel hide caption toggle caption Film Frame/Marvel Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) Captain America (Chris Evans) Thor (Chris Hemsworth) Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). Film Frame/Marvel The Marvel Cinematic Universe whirrs along with Avengers Age Of Ultron which is a true sequel to 2012s The Avengers but also a reward of sorts for making it through the four smaller superhero flicks released in the interim. This is the social contract comic book fans have signed now as Marvel Studios ends Phase 2 of its grand experiment. Put up with a steady stream of what we should start calling Marvelettes each in itself the size of a traditional studio tentpole and every few years youll reap an even grander star-studded megalodon of heroism so awesome it threatens the end of the world. But just because theres a grand plan at work doesnt mean its working. Age Of Ultron feels like it should be firing on all cylinders. It reunites the colorful cabal of Iron Man Captain America Thor Hulk Black Widow and Hawkeye with their one true leader beloved sci-fi writer-director Joss Whedon. Over 140 minutes it allows ample downtime for quips galore Theres the bit where everyone takes turns trying to lift Thors Nordic-god hammer and the running gag where Cap who was flash-frozen in 1942 inadvertently reveals his more prudish sensibilities. It introduces at least four new faces from the comics with cameos from the film franchises vaults. And it deals in transparent themes of evolution the forward progress of humanity of the evil it creates and ultimately of the sort of heroism that must stop it. And yet the film lacks the giddiness of Guardians Of The Galaxy the stylistic touches of Captain America The Winter Soldier the (relatively) deep introspection of Iron Man 3. It is in short more disposable than the mere mortal blockbusters it was designed to outpace. This should defy Marvel Studios mathematics. How can a movie with more stuff than its predecessors be less fun? What was so engaging about the first Avengers movie much more than the world-saving was the thrill of seeing all these distinct personalities enter one anothers orbits for the first time. They could have killed each other; instead they figured out how to work together Dirty Dozen-style. But all that tension is a nonissue for the sequel which begins with six conflict-free good guys conducting a harmonious impeccably choreographed raid on a Hydra stronghold. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr. in helmet-vision) shoots death rays at the advancing hordes as Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) picks them off from afar with his bow. Thor (Chris Hemsworth in full hammy pomposity) and Cap (Chris Evans) pull a combination hammer-shield maneuver that brings the house down. Even Hulk (Mark Ruffalo when un-greened) seems in control of himself. Later Black Widow (Scarlett Johanssson still clad in impractical cleavage-baring leather) will sooth him back to normal with hints of a superromance in the air. This is the purest state of the Avengers the status the first film took its entire length to build toward and it doesnt look much different from an Expendables or Fast amp; Furious movie. As fun as the action is it drives home the inescapable point that this dynamic team must remain composed of static increasingly stale characters. Whedon might be thematically pressuring them to evolve but they cant for fear of jeopardizing the never-ending Marvel movie mission. So instead they must push and pull as a single unit crowding the screen with every Thor one-liner and every assurance that Hawkeye has value perfectly calibrated for group effect. Someone anyone please drive the Avengers apart. You there the snarky sentient virus with the body of a rejected Iron Man prototype and the voice of James Spader. Whats your name? Ultron? Youll do for now. Born out of a failed attempt by Tony Stark/Iron Man to create an automated peacekeeping robot by cross-breeding his own computer program with an alien element Ultron instead makes the philosophical leap to conclude that true world peace will lie only in the Avengers destruction. He lives in the cloud and is at his creepiest when inhabiting a half-formed metal shell that can stumble and gesture like a zombie. Ultron does briefly succeed in sowing doubt among our heroes but only with a little help from the mind-control powers of genetically modified Eastern European refugee Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen flipping her brainwashed/brainwasher dynamic from Martha Marcy May Marlene). She tricks several Avengers into seeing visions of their greatest fears leading to the films best -- and most Whedonesque -- sequences Caps flashbacks to WWII pastels Black Widows icy KGB training. It also sets up a great battle between Iron Man and a possessed Hulk who flails like a slippery muscle-clad eel. But we never really sense that a wedge is being driven between any of the Avengers. Instead of taking on the conflict they just absorb it turning Wanda (aka Scarlet Witch) to the light midway through and adding two more good guys in the process. Their ranks are so crowded theyll soon be able to fill a Comic-Con by themselves. Why care about any one of them anymore? Age Of Ultron has a globe-spanning storyline and entire cities being lifted into the air yet it feels rudimentary perfunctory. Next year the MCUs two most ideologically opposed good guys Cap and Stark will mount separate factions in Captain America Civil War. The award for reaching Phase 3 apparently will be character development.

Photo Marvel The amazing thing aboutA Avengers Age of UltronA is that its reasonably enjoyable while feeling less like a movie than an epic sowing of seeds for multiple Marvel properties. Perhaps only Joss Whedon -- fanboy scholar hack pop visionary humanist -- could satisfy both nerd-do-well Comic-Conners and corporate masters so thoroughly. He has managed to locate the epicenter of the ""universe"" universe. Thats the new Hollywood buzzword universe. First came franchise a term once reserved for 7-Elevens and gas stations which when substituted for the previously used series would make businessmen salivate on cue. Then came tentpole meaning a franchise so huge it could take care of a studios overhead by itself -- and make a lot of smaller poles (i.e. movies that neither cost nor stand to earn that much) from a financial standpoint irrelevant. (In publishing profits from blockbuster authors underwrite the ""mid list"" but Hollywood blockbusters are ends in themselves.) The ""universe"" is that rare Marvel DC Star Trek or Star Wars a tentpole franchise with the potential to spin off a whole constellation of other franchises in films books TV shows games and so on. Its beyond huge. Synergistically speaking its the big bang. Age of Ultron opens mid-bang as the Avengers -- Iron Man Captain America Thor Hulk Hawkeye Black Widow and others -- attempt to snatch Lokis scepter from HYDRA leader Baron Strucker. I didnt have a clue what was going on As both storytelling and storyboarding the sequence is a disgrace. There is one nice moment. Iron Man a.k.a. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) thinks there might be a door in a cave wall and says ""Please be a secret door please be a secret door please be a secret door"" and as he pushes and it opens says ""Yay"" -- no exclamation point the teeny throwaway amid millions of dollars worth of computer-generated pandemonium the perfect distillation of Downeys charm. The sequence also introduces two striking ""enhanced"" beings to the Marvel screen universe the brother-sister Maximoff twins the dream-weaving Scarlet Witch of Elizabeth Olsen and hyperspeed Quicksilver of Aaron Taylor-Johnson. Hang on Wasnt Quicksilver in some X-Men movies? Turns out he was but that universe hasnt yet been linked to this one. Cosmic disconnect Heres this movies thrust. Thoroughly shaken by the extraterrestrial invasion of the first Avengers Stark tells Dr. Bruce Banner a.k.a. Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) that hes going to create an interface between the all-powerful Infinity Stone from Lokis scepter and a computer program thereby giving birth to ""Ultron"" the ultimate planetary defense system. It will bring says Stark ""peace in our time"" -- famous last words. What actually happens is that Ultron takes the voice (and built-in basso sneer) of James Spader and the ridiculous bodybuilder physique of Mr. Cyborg Universe and decides (rather too quickly for the narrative I think) that the only way to save the planet is to kill all its humans which means starting with their protectors the Avengers. He then enlists the Maximoffs savoring in particular the Scarlet Witchs talent for messing with peoples heads destroying them from the inside.A Whedon takes the Avengers universe seriously enough to pack Age of Ultron with Big Themes. Entrepreneur and self-styled mad scientist Stark rejects what he calls ""the man-wasnt-made-to-meddle medley"" (nice line) holding even when Ultron becomes his Frankenstein monster to his quest for bigger and better technologies. This unnerves Banner (a shrinking violet when hes not a green 50-foot slab of beef) and incenses Captain America (Chris Evans) who worries that every time people try to stop a war before it starts they start a war -- the preemptive use of power leading to the kind of fascism he was created to fight. In a late nihilistic bit of dialogue Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and a new team entity Vision decide that humans fatal mistake is ""thinking order and chaos are opposites"" -- suggesting the Marvel credo is Buddhism which isnt the worst foundation for an action series. As he proved in Buffy the Vampire Slayer Firefly and other shows Whedon can find the perfect balance between adolescent hero-worship and smartass banter. (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid must have loomed large for him.) His characters make superheroic declarations and then deflate their own pomp the jokes stopping just short of camp out of respect for the underlying myths. The scenes that anchor Age of Ultron are the loosest demigods drinking goofing on one another competing to pick up Thors hammer as if it were Excalibur. Whedon does everything well except alas action. He gets by (the Marvel house style is bombardment) but still nothing he and his FX designers do has the graphic punch of Sam Raimi or Tim Burton at their (increasingly rare) best or Brad Bird. One problem is the speed which is too fast to savor all the spatial-temporal variables. The best bit is in slow motion a showstopper (there was one in the last film too) in which all the Avengers spin in and out of the frame as the camera weaves among them. Biggest disappointment? Scarlett Johansson -- who nearly somersaulted away with the first Avengers as Black Widow -- is forced into a Beauty-Beast relationship with Hulk and becomes rather mushy. So does Ruffalo. The slight hesitation in his style still works for a man who fearfully monitors his own emotions but the script makes him into a full-time mope. Downey -- apart from that ""yay"" -- is getting to be too much the Little King and is borderline unpleasant. Jeremy Renner gets to show a soft side -- Hawkeye has a wife and kids in a sweet little country house -- but hes more interesting in volatile parts like his scary psycho in The Town. On the plus side the forthright hunkiness of Hemsworth and Evans has its old-fashioned virtues and Olsen with her lemur peepers makes the Scarlet Witch so charismatically damaged she steals every scene. Last year I caught her Juliet in the worst professional Shakespeare production Ive seen. Her verse speaking was fine she moved simply and well and she managed to seem real opposite an emotional no-show of a Romeo. I was sold and still am. Though a mess by all conventional narrative standards Avengers Age of Ultron is a fascinating case study in the rules of ""universe"" storytelling. Chief among them is that a film may not be self-contained -- it must constantly allude to worlds outside its own. Marvel fans want extra characters extra subplots in-jokes that pander to their supposed breadth of knowledge. They dont want closure. There is nothing better than an ending that is also a beginning The sequel must be signaled because the universe must always live in their fantasies.A Whedons heart is pure enough to make this far-reaching commercial strategy seem benign. When his superheroes declared that the way to save the world was by coming together I almost forgot that superheroes coming together make for the kind of franchise tentpole universe movie that threatens to crowd out the films I care about most. The ""universe"" could take over the world more efficiently than Ultron. A version of this article appears in the May 4 2015 issue of New York Magazine.

"Avengers Age of Ultron | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; avengers-age-of-ultron ) Avengers Age of Ultron (United States 2015) April 30 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli It is the 800-pound gorilla in the room the behemoth before which every other would-be blockbuster during the summer of 2015 must bow. Yet perhaps because the filmmakers subconsciously recognized this and didnt feel the pressure to excel the second Avengers movie underwhelms. Sure there are some impressive special effects-saturated battle scenes but despite the interesting camera work these are more frenetic than exciting. Superheroes mowing down an army of robots - sounds as familiar as it plays out. Perhaps the biggest drawback to Avengers Age of Ultron is the weakness of the central villain and his generic genocidal scheme. Ho-hum. The brief glimpse of Thanos (avoiding the screen until a mid-end credits cameo) reminds us that the real bad guy remains behind the curtain. Hes been there so long weve grown tired of waiting for him to emerge. Avengers Age of Ultron is an unnecessary stepping-stone on the road to the mega-smackdown that will be Avengers Infinity War Part 1  and Avengers Infinity War Part 2  (due for release in 2018 and 2019 respectively). In an era when movies about computers gaining sentience have become commonplace Age of Ultron offers a less-than-compelling interpretation of A.I. The title entity given life through the use of an alien contraption rather than as a result of a scientific breakthrough isnt that different from Star Trek The Motion Pictures VGer except Ultron (whose voice is provided by James Spader) is a 9-foot high robot bent on ""cleansing"" the Earth whereas VGer was a little bigger. (The similarities between the two films end there however.) Ultron isnt the most interesting of adversaries and his big bad scheme is worthy of a Roger Moore James Bond movie - unnecessarily convoluted for the desired goal. The Avengers dont seem to be themselves - or at least not the group we bonded with in 2012. The sense of camaraderie has weakened. Robert Downey Jr. in particular seems distracted. His Tony Stark is usually a delight; here the panache is missing. Hes just a ""mad scientist"" with a bad case of narcissism. Captain America (Chris Evans) has reverted to his pre-Winter Soldier self. Although the events from that movie are mentioned in passing the impacts they had on the character dont manifest themselves. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) stands around looking handsome hefting his hammer and tossing out inappropriate one-liners. The characters who dont have their own franchises but spend their time carpetbagging in other Marvel titles are served a little better. Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) is provided with a disturbing series of flashbacks although her love affair with Bruce Banner/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) comes out of nowhere and feels forced. Wasnt a Captain America/Black Widow romance hinted at in Winter Soldier? Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) is magically given a family in order to provide an ""emotional"" payoff. The two newcomers - Scarlett Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) - are underdeveloped and underused. Age of Ultron feels as much like a product as Iron Man 3. The screenplay is sloppy. Character development is perfunctory when it exists at all. Things come alive during the action scenes but they are more loud and busy than exciting. Dead-end and extraneous subplots abound stretching out a narrative that would have been better streamlined with 30 minutes trimmed. The dialogue consists mainly of pseudo-philosophical musings (Tony Stark on how to save humanity; Bruce Banner on his relationship with Hulk) and one-liners.  Some of the latter are witty but most are lame. Age of Ultron starts by dumping us in the middle of a battle thereby allowing the film to ignore various continuity questions about the team re-assembling following the most recent round of solo adventures. It turns out that the Avengers are on a raid to retrieve Lokis scepter and once they get it Tony Stark believes he can use it to realize his long-simmering dream of ""Ultron"" - a massive A.I. that can ""encase Earth in armor"" and protect it from an alien invasion.  Through means that are not sufficiently explained Ultron gains consciousness but does so with a chip on his shoulder. His goal is to upgrade humanity by destroying the people.  Hes too powerful for the combined might of The Avengers but instead of finishing them off he goes to ground so they can spend half the movie fighting among themselves while looking for him. For the final battle which includes the destruction of a city writer/director Joss Whedon repudiates the wanton carnage of Man of Steel.  Age of Ultron insists that all humans be evacuated before the round of destruction begins. This is Whedon saying to Zack Snyder ""You let your heroes participate in a population massacre. In our movies the heroes first and foremost protect humanity even when the choice proves inconvenient."" On a visual level the dizzying busyness of the battle sequences echoes that of a Transformers movie. More than one of the big action setups feels like something out of an exceptionally well-made video game. This is the Michael Bay approach - prioritizing spectacle over everything else. Whedons attempts to avoid this by adding character-building scenes might have worked if those were better written and less awkwardly incorporated. 3-D and IMAX are superfluous frills that cost viewers money while adding little to the overall experience. The IMAX countdown at the beginning is the most compelling use of 3-D in the entire 2 1/2 hours. Age of Ultron disappoints not because its irredeemably bad but because it fails to achieve the level of its predecessor in nearly every facet. Dialogue acting character interaction battle scenes payoff tone style suspense - all these things are below the bar established by The Avengers. If Marvel is going to make a misstep with these characters I suppose this is the time to do it. Not much is riding on the success or failure of Age of Ultron. Next time this group assembles however it will be a different situation. The stakes in the Marvel Universe are about to be elevated and lapses like Age of Ultron will be far more damaging.

Hey Wait Im not finished Who shouted ""Action""? You guessed it. The sequel ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" doesnt waste a nanosecond before plunging us into its particular hurly-burly of superhero-meets-foe combat. Make that ""superheroes."" The plural matters here. Perhaps even more (certainly differently) than it does in that other crowded very fine Marvel franchise ""X-Men."" Those dear mutants unite initially because of their minority often misunderstood status. The Avengers are a collection of outsize talents often with bigger egos bound in defense of humankind. The gang from 2012s ridiculously entertaining ""Avengers"" is all here. In the heroic hubris department theres Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans). A little less vain but pretty darn glorious are Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). In a tormented class all his own resides Bruce Banner/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). Writer-director Joss Whedon continues to explore the challenges of teamwork and heroism without losing a beat of action or a single quip. If anything theres more of each done better. Heck Eugene ONeill gets a shoutout. Whedon is also attuned to the twisted roots of villainy. ""Age of Ultron"" provides a few versions the ache for revenge ye ol desire for world domination and the good technological intention gone terribly awry. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen portray orphan twins Pietro and Wanda Maximoff. Recruited and tweaked by Hydra the lethal pair harbors a sincere hatred of Stark now a recovering weapons manufacturer. Even now the billionaire industrialist has his moments of high-tech overreach. Ultron the artificial intelligence bent on humanitys eradication is born out of Starks altruism. James Spader gives dark wry voice to the sentient being who grows smarter and more dangerous with each passing moment. Yes Starks and the Avengers most daunting rival is one of their own making with a little help from Wanda who can manipulate thought and exploit doubts and from the scepter from Thors world. OK it can get a bit convoluted. For those of you not conversant in all things Marvel-ous I hear you. During the movies preview screening a colleague leaned over to ask if I knew who the twins birth daddy was. ""Er no."" If youre not the sort DVRing televisions ""Agent Carter"" or ""Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."" or re-watching each solo project of the member of this band of superheroes fear not. Let the obsessed have their crossover pleasures their genealogies their flow-charts. Whedon amp; Co. provide more than enough glib jokes FX spectacles and sweet human insights to make ""Age of Ultron"" a popcorn must for the rest of us in need of a little comic-book wisdom right about now.

By Peter Rainer Film critic April 30 2015 Save for later Saved About video ads About video ads View Caption of The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide ""The Avengers"" was the third-highest-grossing film of all time and I dont doubt that ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" which is semi-enjoyable but not as good will also ascend the higher reaches of moola. Such is the megapopularity of this Marvel superhero franchise that the filmmakers could have featured the clan playing dodgeball and achieved a similar success.Theres quite a bit more than dodgeball going on in ""Ultron"" to the point of literal overkill. All the stalwarts looking as fit as usual are back Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) Natasha/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Thor (Chris Hemsworth). Their nemesis is Ultron (voiced with snide amusement by James Spader) a state-of-the-art humanoid who of course wants to take over the world and unload a new race of mass-produced android soldiers. Writer-director Joss Whedon attempts to inject just enough human drama into these noisy proceedings to keep it from turning into a ""Transformers""-style crashathon. (Best subplot Black Widow and The Hulk get closer but no smooches.) The action sequences arent especially well designed and the plot such as it is is essentially one catastrophe after another. The Avengers attempts at smarty-pants wisecracks arent all that smart. And yet none of this probably matters to the films geekish fan base who are already slavering for sequels. Grade B- (Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi action violence and destruction and for some suggestive comments.)

Handout/TNS Chris Vognar Culture Critic chrisvognar cvognardallasnews.com Charm and humor balance the mayhem of the Avengers Age of Ultron (B+) Apr. 30 2015 1200pm Close Sharing really is caring... Close Join the conversation... With Chris Vognar Share This Story Share Discuss Meh Beneath the thoughtful ridiculousness and blithe sound and fury of Avengers Age of Ultron lies the core idea that drives this whole hugely profitable franchise. You see these people are just like us only more awesome.They crack wise on one another and drop pop culture references amid the mass destruction. They go out for drinks together and get jocular. Their egos need feeding and they yearn for stability.This streak of humanity provides the levity needed to keep an overly busy plot moving. It also keeps us from thinking about the flurry of pixels and green screenery invested in each action sequence including the obligatory and interminable grand finale in which a fictional Eastern European city floats in the air as mankinds fate hangs in the balance.By making the Avengers snarky rivals as well as brothers and sisters in arms franchise Big Brain Joss Whedon injects exactly what such a noisy spectacle needs a dollop of charm. The prime fount is Robert Downey Jr.s Tony Stark who explains his fatigue thusly ""Its been a real long day. Like Eugene ONeill long."" It has indeed. Stark the alter ego of Iron Man and the most alpha of the Avengers alpha dogs has unleashed an artificial intelligence system named Ultron a ghost in the machine who acquires a hulking metal body and thankfully the sardonic bravado of James Spaders voice. Ultron may be Starks baby but he doesnt think much of Iron Man Captain America Thor and the rest of the gang.Age of Ultron finds time to bandy about big ideas about scientific hubris and mans overreach for domination. This may be the most staggeringly destructive antiwar movie ever made and you have to chuckle when the screenplay gives lip service to the idea of preventing civilian casualties. Theres enough full-scale mayhem going down in Ultron to kill civilians for generations to come. But not really because you know PG-13.Whedon is imaginative enough to carve out some wonderfully cinematic moments from the rubble. When Scarlett Johanssons Black Widow coaxes the Hulk back into the human form of Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) the movie takes on the romantic grandeur of classical myth. (Its also pretty remarkable how eerily the Hulks facial features resemble Ruffalos.) Hulk/Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) in ""Avengers Age of Ultron."" (Photo courtesy Marvel/TNS) Handout/TNS The mind spells cast by another Stark hater Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) bring to life free-associative nightmare visions worthy of great science fiction.Casting is half the battle in elevating this kind of fare and reaching an audience beyond the fanboys and true believers. Put Ruffalo Downey Johansson Don Cheadle and Jeremy Renner on-screen together and youre going to generate some sparks of intelligence.Even when Ultron spins its action wheels and sends its heroes and villains through their computer-generated rigors it exerts a moderately human touch. Glib yes and a little too cocky for close comfort. But human nonetheless.AVENGERS AGE OF ULTRON (B+)Directed by Joss Whedon.

EntertainmentMovies Avengers Age of Ultron Fun with a vengeance Originally published April 30 2015 at 1205 am Updated April 30 2015 at 353 pm A review of ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" another marvelous Marvel Comics adaptation for the screen directed by Joss Whedon. Rating 3 stars out of 4. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic Two kinds of viewers will be headed to Joss Whedons ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" the comic fans watching closely to see how precisely the movie hones to Marvel-set characters and conventions and the rest of us who just want to see some well-crafted mayhem and some funny banter. Speaking as a member of the latter group (dont ask me to tell you what ""vibranium"" is) I can tell you that the film delivers; its big its often dazzling and its good fun. If it at times feels a bit familiar ... well the original ""Avengers"" movie was pretty terrific and theres only so much new that Whedon can bring this time to the saving-the-world-in-high-tech-outfits thing. Some fresh faces of course turn up. The villain Ultron whos naturally out to destroy the world is a tall spindly and thoroughly evil robot introduced intriguingly by a trippy waterfall/kaleidoscope of tiny squares and screens. Hes voiced in oiled-metal tones by James Spader as all evil robots should be. We meet a pair of new Avengers in the form of twin siblings Pietro (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) Maximoff aka Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. In the cogent words of Agent Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) ""hes fast and shes weird"" and I quite enjoyed the way Pietro rather precisely cracks his neck before entering battle and how Wanda employs her deliciously evil grin. And we learn that one of our Avengers has a rather idyllic home life with a wife (Linda Cardellini) who gets to deliver perhaps the greatest Understanding Spouse line of dialogue ever ""You know I support your avenging."" But as before the greatest fun is in watching the original Avengers all fine actors whove made the characters their own. Movie Review    Avengers Age of Ultron with Robert Downey Jr. Chris Hemsworth Mark Ruffalo Chris Evans Scarlett Johansson Jeremy Renner Don Cheadle Aaron Taylor-Johnson Elizabeth Olsen Paul Bettany Cobie Smulders Stellan Skarsgard James Spader Samuel L. Jackson. Written and directed by Joss Whedon based on the Marvel comic book series. 141 minutes. Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi action violence and destruction and for some suggestive comments. Several theaters. Robert Downey Jr. continues to play Tony Stark/Iron Man like improvisational jazz; his little just-for-himself ""yea"" upon finding a secret door is priceless. Chris Hemsworths fish-out-of-water Thor continues to occupy his own world except for a throwaway moment near the end where he notes perplexedly ""Im running out of things to say"" And romance blooms sort of between Mark Ruffalos melancholy Bruce Banner/Hulk and Scarlett Johanssons cool Natasha/Black Widow. This relationship seems the very definition of a bad idea but its irresistible particularly when the two flirt to the strains of a big band playing ""I Cant Get Started."" (Hey we non-comic-book fans have our own weaknesses er Kryptonite.) Related story Director Joss Whedon on Avengers Anything that looks easy wasnt Elsewhere worlds collide buildings collapse and havoc is wreaked -- all in impressive if slightly video-gamey 3D. (Odd how 3D can make a movie on a giant screen seem both larger and smaller simultaneously. Its also being released in 2D and I suspect would still be quite satisfying.) ""Age of Ultron"" is as good as it needs to be and often better and it ends (stick around through the first phase of the final credits) with a hint of whats coming next. Im hoping though for a bit more of a jolt next time with ""Avengers Infinity War"" a two-parter due in 2018 and 2019 rather than familiar pleasures.

Whether playing an 80s cokehead or ""the dude playin the dude disguised as another dude"" RDJ works best when his characters mind zooms on overdrive. Its why his Iron Man is the kinetic heart of the big-screen Avengers. We call them extras but Hollywood has a euphemism for the people in movies who dont have dialogue ""atmosphere.""Atmosphere is also the vital ingredient in a fire.Director Joss Whedon has finally heard the cries of the little people whose kin have been kindling in comic-book movies such as the inhumane ""Man of Steel."" In ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" the superheroes arent just flexing their muscles (although theres plenty of that); theyre protecting a planet full of frail humans the people who inevitably die when costumed characters topple skyscrapers. Respect for human life was the foundation of the first ""Captain America"" which is still the best of the recent Avengers-related movies. Now ""Age of Ultron"" has added a heart-shaped piece to a sprawling jigsaw puzzle. With all the expectations egos and storylines that a project like this must balance its close to the best movie that a skeptic could have imagined.With the addition of Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen at least a dozen name-brand actors are now battling for the spotlight here. The newcomers play twins Pietro and Wanda Maximoff who blame Stark Industries for the decimation of their Slavic village. Thanks to some old Nazis the twins are genetically enhanced (with super-speed and witchcraft respectively) to exact revenge against Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and his Avengers.In case youve been entombed in ice for the past few decades Starks combative cohorts include rageaholic Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) true-blue super-soldier Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) neo-Norse god Thor (Chris Hemsworth) sharpshooter Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and sexy assassin Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). Each of them gets a few over-repeated jokes and a dramatic subplot (and thanks to witchy Wanda a psychedelic dream sequence exposing their weaknesses). The best subplot is Natashas growing love for Bruce whose Hulk-ness she is able to control or unleash as needed. (An extended smackdown between the Hulk and Iron Man is the stuff that fanboy dreams of made of.)The central story is that the old Nazis devised an artificial-intelligence program that Stark wants to harness as a global peacekeeping apparatus. But the hive mind has a sting to it and the disembodied knowledge takes the physical form of the robot Ultron (terrifically voiced by James Spader). Ultron determines that the best way to keep the peace is to eliminate the warrior species called humans. Even as Ultron is wreaking havoc from fictional Sovokia to Seoul Stark has an almost fascistic faith in the law-and-order algorithm. Fortunately Captain America speaks up for the huddled masses who are yearning to be free from falling concrete and a good portion of the movie is devoted to evacuating civilians. Less fortunately Marvel still hasnt figured out how to end one of these CGI free-for-alls without invoking yet another magic crystal or intoning another speech about the duality of the cosmos. Both those chores fall to Paul Bettany as a messianic new character called Vision.""Age of Ultron"" has self-aware laughs grandiose themes and the best effects that money can buy. But at this point it will take true vision to plot the umpteen sequels without getting trapped in a time loop.What ""Avengers Age of Ultron""  Three stars out of four  Run time 221  Rating PG-13  Content Intense sequences of sci-fi action violence and destruction and some suggestive comments Joe Williams  314-340-8344Film criticjoethecritic on Twitterjoewilliamspost-dispatch.com Summer movie preview Girls to the rescue Hollywood looks to females young and old to save the seasons slate of movies.

(Marvel/Walt Disney Studios) Were mad scientists monsters. You gotta own it."" Thats Tony Stark lecturing his partner in world-saving Bruce Banner while fooling around with a little sentience-integration work in the lab in ""Avengers Age of Ultron."" As the second installment of the Marvel Comics-based series that began in 2012 ""Age of Ultron"" seeks mightily to portray its core group of superheroes as misfits and antiheroes haunted by their own compromised pasts and emotional shadow material. The fact that ""Age of Ultron"" only partially succeeds at that mission is actually a good thing. As he did in the first ""Avengers"" writer-director Joss Whedon avoids the fatal trap of comic-book self-seriousness leavening a baggy busy overpopulated story with zippy one-liners quippy asides and an overarching tone of jaunty good fun. There are plenty of blockbusters these days that feature a noisy protracted risibly improbable motorcycle chase; ""Age of Ultron"" may be the first in which the driver delivers a cheerful ""beep-beep"" as shes plowing through pedestrian traffic. [Summer Movie Guide Popcorn flicks with a sprinkling of nostalgia] Its just that chirpy unpretentious tone that sets Whedons ""Avengers"" apart from the superhero pack and that barely saves ""Age of Ultron"" from collapsing under its own overdetermined weight. There are great swaths of this movie that viewers may never understand. (Where exactly does the Hulk go when he disappears for minutes on end?) And like so many examples of the genre this sequel suffers from repetitive too-long action sequences and the utterly useless cash-grab of 3-D. The draw here is the band thats getting back together as Captain America Iron Man Thor the Hulk Hawkeye and Black Widow recapture the prickly chemistry that makes them click. The novelty lies in watching them dispatch yet a brand new villain in this case the title character a silky-voiced ember-eyed robot played with characteristic suaveness by James Spader. [Just how many records can this hulked-out sequel smash?] Before he shows up though fans are treated to a reprise of what made the first ""Avengers"" such a blast ""Age of Ultron"" begins in the midst of a by-the-numbers battle in which the team members show off their individual strengths (a tableau that will be recapitulated in a third-act donnybrook that plays like a greatest hits medley). But the real fun starts when the group gets together for a party at Starks Manhattan penthouse and the patter starts pinging. While Tony/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) spar about their absent girlfriends Bruce/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Natasha/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) exchange meaningful glances at the bar. Later Thor challenges all comers to see if they can lift his Asgardian hammer as magnificently overcompensating a phallic symbol as it sounds. Ultron returns to cause even more trouble for the heroes in another trailer for Marvels ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" in theaters May 1. (Walt Disney Pictures) Its all terribly silly. (""None of this makes any sense"" says Jeremy Renners Hawkeye at one point.) And Whedon and his cast make few apologies for that fact. Rather they lean into the outsize feelings and gestures with a combination of goofy humor and utterly sober and convincing focus on their individual characters anxieties and motivations. All of them have secrets and issues to work out -- the most tortured being Ruffalos quiet mournful Bruce Banner -- and they come distressingly into play when the group meets a pair of Slavic twins portrayed by Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen the latter of whom plays a dazed-looking spellbinder with a gift for mind games. For all the troubled doors Olsens character opens for the protagonists however Whedon never lets the dark stuff overwhelm the easygoing even warm atmosphere hes set up whether by way of that little ""beep-beep"" Natasha delivers on her motorcycle or Tony Stark compulsively referencing everything from graffiti artist Banksy to Eugene ONeill to Yahtzee. Stark of course is the most obnoxious of the Avengers a wealthy cock-of-the-walk embodiment of entitlement and arrogance whos just begging to be taken down several notches. He meets his match knowing wink for knowing wink in Ultron a character thats tailor-made for Spaders late-career incarnation as the smooth erudite baddie whos so easy to loathe. The battle of wits between the two ultimately pivots around issues of super-ego and id pluralism and chauvinism chaos and order. Theyre noble even poetic sentiments -- especially when theyre engaged by Paul Bettanys Jarvis who assumes a gratifyingly central and expressive role here -- but theyre nearly drowned out in battle scenes that reduce the entire world to a dusty shredded pulp. Whedon stages the literally earth-shattering mayhem with impressive commitment but the inevitable computer-generated apocalypse has begun to look tiresomely standard-issue by now. No one will leave ""Age of Ultron"" breathlessly analyzing how the filmmakers staged a disastrous earthquake in a fictional Eastern European country any more than theyll be talking about redundant set pieces involving robot armies and last-ditch rescues. Theyll be talking about Starks ever-reliable bravado; Bruces solitary psychic journey; whether the enormous green rage-monster and Natasha will ever get together and -- most important for the Marvel franchise -- whether the handful of new characters introduced in ""Age of Ultron"" can hold their own with this flawlessly well-tuned ensemble. Casting has been a crucial element in the ""Avengers"" formula and once again Whedon has enlisted surpassingly gifted actors to inhabit an ever-widening shared universe. Hes wise enough to know that these funny conflicted deeply pained characters are never more human than when theyre at their most monstrous. PG-13. At area theaters. Contains intense sequences of sci-fi action violence and destruction and some suggestive comments. 141 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Avengers Age of Ultron is a complicated ticking machine -- a cuckoo clock under attack. Returning helmer Joss Whedon is earnestly trying to make a movie out of a bag of bolts six stars nine cameos and three enemies plus at least 10 films to go before the climactic Avengers Infinity War -- Part II opens in May 2019. In Age of Ultrons opening tracking shot through a forest battlefield you sense Whedon racing to cram it all in before the bell tolls.His camera (or really his computer) swoops from Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) steering a jeep to Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) zipping arrows then to Thor (Chris Hemsworth) to Captain America (Chris Evans) to the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) to a slow-motion tableau of the five leaping toward the right as Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) whizzes overhead sucking the lens into his backdraft and pulling us to a firefight over a medieval fort. Finally Whedon exhales and cuts giving the first close-up to of course that megalomaniac and box office cash cow Tony Stark.Film Details Avengers Age of Ultron RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time141 min. More Info Trailer Our tone is set not that we didnt know the tone already. Age of Ultron doesnt bother with surprises. It simply is a movie monolith for the devout. A Zen calm has overtaken the characters who fight and flip without ever being short of breath. Laser bolts can miss them by inches and theyll nonchalantly crack a joke about home remodeling as though that seconds-ago near-death never happened. Though the whole planet is in peril -- as ever -- their attitude is so low-stakes that we forget too. In the Age of Under-Slept Animators blockbuster warfare is just a digital blur.Whedon who also wrote the script recognizes that fans come for the kicks but remember the quips. He wants to give us everything and that he fits it all in is its own kind of feat. Age of Ultron is a middling film yet its so heavy with his sweat that it never feels like a lazy cash-in -- which for a preordained summer megahit is an accomplishment. Whedon is a people-pleaser the kind of old-school director who can confidently pivot between genres even within the same film. I sometimes think Hollywood would be better off with more master craftsmen like him and fewer tortured geniuses aping Christopher Nolan. (Our film schools would certainly be emptier.)

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm Whedon seems as if he might be happy to split the difference and shave 50 million from Age of Ultrons total haul if audiences would applaud it as the best movie ever. (Many will anyway but Whedon is smart enough to shun cheap compliments.) Its at once more mediocre and exhausted than the original but also more thoughtful. The gags are still distracting -- in the first film they mostly came from mean-spirited Stark acting like the emcee at a roast; now theyre more tied in to the characters such as Cap bemoaning that he cant afford to move back home to Brooklyn. Everyones temper still runs as hot and cold as a hormonal teenagers and midfilm the team are angry at one another just because the script says so. Yet Ultron is also more structurally stable than the first Avengers which had to spend half its running time just shoving everyone into the same room. Since then Thor Iron Man and Captain America have all had full sequels of their own allowing Ultron to allocate its attention to relative newbies Black Widow Hulk and Hawkeye.The Widow and Bruce Banner are beginning to flirt which Johanssons Russian killer does with all the subtlety of a wallflower wasted on Tequiza at her goodbye-high-school party. Banner continues to be racked with guilt about his green rampages and spends his cool-down time listening to opera on Beats by Dre headphones. Theres a good moment when Thor fails to cheer him up by beaming ""The gates of Hell are filled with the screams of his victims"" And theres a great moment where Hawkeye admits to being marginal to the team mock-groaning ""Were fighting a city of robots and I have a bow and arrow -- this makes no sense."" But Hawkeyes newly revealed secret wife (Linda Cardellini) gets the best line of all sending him off to war with ""You know I totally support your avenging.""For all the fuss about these billion-dollar Avengers that word -- avenger -- has been curiously overlooked. To avenge one must first be attacked. Yet ""avenger"" best describes Ultrons new villains Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) as orphan twins from the war-torn fictional land of Sokovia where locals speak English with a Dracula accent. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witchs parents were killed by Stark-brand bombs. Is it fair that they want Iron Man dead? Ultron dares to ask the question but it cant actually answer.Meanwhile Stark and Banner are going on the offensive by designing an artificially intelligent weapon -- Ultron -- that Stark hopes will protect the world so he can retire a wish the real Downey Jr. clearly carries in his bones. Naturally Ultron decides that he can best protect the world by exterminating every human on it. Given that the film massacres four battalions of bloodless PG-13-appropriate robots you cant really blame this bad guy either. Whedon flirts with the idea that the destructive Avengers are bad for the environment. Theyre definitely bad for real estate developers as they Hulk-smash several cities. (Stark thoughtfully purchases a skyscraper seconds before he flattens it to rubble.)Of all the fated moments in the most foretold hit of the summer the most honest comes when two robots stand on a hill admitting that mankind is doomed. Perhaps in 2035 an android can direct the 20th Avengers sequel.AVENGERS AGE OF ULTRON | Written and directed by Joss Whedon | Marvel/Disney | Citywide Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

With another hit. From the very first word in the new Avengers blockbuster you know youre in for a Mach 5 roller-coaster ride with many stops at Ferris wheels bumper cars water slides and merry-go-rounds. ""The Avengers Age of Ultron"" an industrial-powered Marvel/Disney entertainment behemoth piloted by writer/director Joss Whedon starts with a hello that Uncle Walt and Stan Lee would never approve and thats the first shot in a barrage of clever naughty moving inventive ideas fired at Gatling-gun speed. It feels as if this comic book franchise has become a never-ending cinema story. If future films are as well realized as ""Ultron"" thats fine by me. Whedon equally good at action spectacle and solid narrative begins in the middle of things. Without a tweet of setup we launch into an extended battle extravaganza following individual Avengers duo teams and all six united to clobber an evil HYDRA army in a European forest. Theres the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) partnering with Bruce Banners Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). Archery whiz Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) fires his bow as fast as the hammer of Thor (Chris Hemsworth). Captain America (Chris Evans) races through the combat on his supersonic motorcycle as Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) strafes from the skies in his Iron Man armor. Its a blissfully realized blitzkrieg presented with full confidence that we already understand these characters enjoy elegant production design and dislike needless exposition. Its also a master class in how to launch viewer interest and delight. With the villains brought down and their home base in mythical Sokovia emptied the group moves ahead as Downeys preening egotist thinks they should to a gala party in his Manhattan penthouse. Its a chance to let audiences breathe and let the cast act. The previous film introduced these once-independent superhero stars as strangers wrestling with their resentments of each other while trying to tackle their external enemies. Here theyre relaxed and celebratory with plenty of laughs (this film contains a remarkably good series of gags about Thors magical mallet). Banner and the Black Widow are progressing beyond a close friendship. She so effectively talks him down from his green attack mode with her ""Hey big guy"" lullabies that they are moving toward wonder of wonders a potential romance. Which in time triggers a priceless Iron Man zucchini joke that is only barely PG-13. Its part of Whedons signature balancing act between racing hitting and shooting and heartfelt human interaction. In his 2012 smash ""The Avengers"" he rescued the problematic character of the Hulk by focusing on Banners emotional anguish and his alter egos Tasmanian Devil comic violence. Here he pushes Hawkeye beyond his near-cameo in earlier films with a look at the life and values and family the archer has on his own. Whedon doesnt focus so much on explosions that we lose track of the human heart. His film and TV projects outperform his competitors because he allows us to learn and care about the players. And sometimes to dislike them. For his victory prize narcissistic weapons designer Stark devises an artificially intelligent shield to defend Earth from alien attack. The plan is a pompous take on a valuable principle. Instead of inventing a guardian Stark creates the robotic title character the biggest baddest comic book villain in a million bazillion infinity years. Voiced by James Spader Ultron is also the most sarcastic. He explains that he sees his mission as destroying the Avengers and humanity itself then coasts into Pinocchios ""Ive Got No Strings."" Who but Whedon could imagine this cheerful Disney charmer in the key of doom ""Ive got no strings / To hold me down / To make me fret or make me frown / I had strings / But now Im free / There are no strings on me."" Ultron cant wait to kill his Geppetto father figure since the poisoned apple falls close to the sour tree. He quickly drafts allies in Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) and Pietro Maximoff (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) super-powered Sokovian twins whose parents were killed a decade earlier by Stark-brand bombshells. Wandas abilities let her push each Avenger into paranoia by triggering their individual nightmares -- Stark imagining giant mechanical electric eels Thor visiting Asgards dancing dead. The film gives much of its attention to the teams efforts to hold onto their loyalty now that the institution of S.H.I.E.L.D. has been decimated and their small corps faces attacks designed to break them apart. It builds to a bombastic finale a limitless overstuffed smorgasbord of sky-high battle. It works where Michael Bays pointless Transformers films and Zack Snyders disappointing ""Man of Steel"" stumbled. First Whedon avoids cutting so fast that the fireballs falling buildings and smashed cars feel like outtakes from a demolition derby. More important his warriors prize saving the civilians. A large part of the climax derring-do is about rescuing humans a heartening hero-cheering notion. This chapter has already picked up more than 200 million from the world box office before its U.S. opening and seems set to break 1 billion soon. I bet well be seeing a few more. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

"Review Avengers Age of Ultron is full of thrills but forgettable - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Avengers Age of Ultron is full of thrills but quickly forgettable Review Avengers Age of Ultron is full of thrills but forgettable Marvel Marvel Chris Evans as Captain America in ""Avengers Age of Ultron."" Chris Evans as Captain America in ""Avengers Age of Ultron."" (Marvel Marvel) Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter Age of Ultron is effective moment to moment but very little lingers in the mind afterward It would be silly to pretend that ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" isnt good at what it does that its not proficient at delivering superhero thrills for those who crave them most.With a budget of 250 million a surfeit of stunts explosions and computer effects not to mention a checklist of Marvel Comics champions that includes Iron Man the Hulk Thor Captain America Black Widow and Hawkeye this ""Avengers"" definitely does not go the minimalist route. (It even throws in a couple of characters named Maximoff for good measure.) As written and directed by the skilled Joss Whedon this Avengers movie even has in its namesake Ultron a convincingly twisted villain played by James Spader. Sounding uncomfortably presidential in his search for ""the power to make real change"" Ultron wants to destroy the world and kill everyone in it for the best possible reasons.But even as all these good things are acknowledged the uncomfortable reality remains that although this movie is effective moment to moment very little of it lingers in the mind afterward. The ideal vehicle for our age of immediate sensation and instant gratification it disappears without a trace almost as soon as its consumed. Given that the Marvel movies are in effect expensive Saturday matinee serials bringing back the same familiar characters time after time after time (this is for instance the fifth film in which Robert Downey Jr. has starred as Iron Man) that lack of staying power is perhaps inevitable. Its the brand finally not the individual episodes that matter most to the powers that be. Avengers Age of Ultron Elizabeth Olsen talks Scarlet Witchs Wiggly Woo Gina McIntyre Gina McIntyre Whedon whose first Avengers movie was more appealing in part because his sensibility was fresher works very hard to compensate for this over-familiarity in big ways and small. Even the Avengers weaponry the press material informs us has been ""tweaked"" with Captain America (Chris Evans) getting a shield with a boomerang effect and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) acquiring an automated quiver ideal for the swiftest possible loading of arrows.Whedons dialogue writing is also a plus and not just for the clever lines he comes up with. There may be no one else who would or could fit amusing references to Banksy Eugene ONeill and how hard it is to afford a place in Brooklyn into a superhero epic. Avengers Age of Ultron Trailer Avengers Age of Ultron Trailer Avengers Age of Ultron Trailer See more videos The filmmaker also tries to make up for character familiarity by taking advantage of Marvels penchant for superheroes with complex psyches and for instance amping up the potential for romance between the troubled Bruce Banner/the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). And knowing that Marvel audiences hunger for fresh blood just as much as the vampires in ""Twilight"" he has given space to those Maximoffs the twins employed by the evil empire Hydra to battle the Avengers and usually known by their superpower names. Pietro Maximoff (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is the superfast Quicksilver and sister Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) is Scarlet Witch characterized by the ability to cloud mens minds.Where this Avengers movie is at its weakest is in its plot. Well-made though each action sequence may be there are so many of them including more going on in the pre-credits sequence than in many entire films that everything blurs together. One may remember that the Hulk went on a rampage in Johannesburg South Africa of all places but there have been so many rampages in so many movies that reasons and motivations get lost in a frenetic undifferentiated heap.Whether this is what fans ravenous for nonstop stimulation want what Wheedon prefers or what the Marvel hierarchy mandates all this action overloads the senses. When you add in a bloated running time of two hours 22 minutes what happens on the screen stays on the screen and is difficult to recall later on.Thats a shame because it detracts from Ultron one of the most memorable of Marvel movie villains and an entity impossible to confuse with anything else.Before we meet Ultron the Avengers raid a Hydra redoubt in the conveniently fictional country of Sokovia. There they recover Lokis powerful scepter which had somehow fallen into the hands of the evildoers.Back in the U.S. of A. where the Avengers have their own skyscraper complete with an enormous logo Tony Stark (Downey) gets the unfortunate idea to clandestinely use the scepter to create Ultron a creature of artificial intelligence he intends to function as a global peace-keeping apparatus.But wouldnt you know it wires get crossed and Ultron gets everything mixed up. ""I know you mean well but you havent thought it through"" he tells the overmatched and befuddled Avengers. ""There is only one path to peace your extinction.""Beautifully voiced and brought to life by Spader in a motion capture suit Ultron is eccentric enough to do things like singing ""there are no strings on me"" when he initially breaks free of Starks control. Ultron is certainly a memorable creation which is not always what you can say about the film that brought him to life.kenneth.turanlatimes.com------------Avengers Age of UltronMPAA rating PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi action violence and destruction and for some suggestive commentsRunning time 2 hours 22 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Reviews Avengers Age of Ultron storms overseas box office Joss Whedon and cast face superheroic challenge in Avengers Age of Ultron Avengers Age of Ultron premiere Marvel stars on the red carpet Avengers Age of Ultron Chris Evans on Captain Americas search for home Joss Whedon and cast face superheroic challenge in Avengers Age of Ultron Avengers Age of Ultron Elizabeth Olsen talks Scarlet Witchs Wiggly Woo Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad78deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-avengers-review-20150430-column.html,200,avengersageofultron20,avengersageofultron,latimes

"Avengers Age of Ultron (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Avengers Age of Ultron (PG-13) Writer-director Joss Whedon gets the Marvel Comics superhero group right on his second time around. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com4/29/2015 Editor rating 3 Joss Whedon has announced he wont be making any more Marvel Studios movies -- the five years he spent writing and directing The Avengers and its sequel Age of Ultron wore him out -- which is too bad because he was starting to get really good at it. Where the first film often bore the whiff of laborious obligation reintroducing characters we already knew from other movies and explaining how they wound up fighting on the same team the new movie gets to the fun stuff right from the opening shot A long uninterrupted take during which each of Earths mightiest heroes makes a rousing entrance during a raid on a mountainside compound in an Eastern European country. Whedon is having a blast here his camera careening across the battlefield with rib-tickling speed and this time youre able to hop on and take the ride alongside him. When Whedon was given the keys to the first Avengers movie he had directed only one other film before (Serenity) and his inexperience with juggling all the moving parts of such an enormous enterprise showed. Despite all its commercial and (inexplicable) critical success the first picture was an impersonal lugubrious drag peppered with brief sparks of excitement and imagination. Age of Ultron is a much more confident work -- you can feel Whedons artful stamp on every frame -- even though its bigger in scale and introduces several characters including the superpowered twins Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) who could beat the Flash in a footrace and the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) who can mess with the minds of her opponents. They are not the only newbies in the movie but in an era in which studios reveal way too much of their films in order to ramp up pre-release excitement theres no need to ruin here what few surprises the picture has in store. The big setpieces in Age of Ultron -- and there are many -- reveal Whedon has become a formidable choreographer of thrilling furious action. At times the images resemble panels of a comic book with careful compositions and visuals (including a fantastic use of a mega-zoom during one of the battles) that dont feel like more of the same-old. A fight between an angry Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) sporting his Hulkbuster armor is a showstopper funny and rousing and imaginative all at the same time. Even more than in the first film Whedon injects humor into almost every scene grounding the preposterous goings-on with laughs At one point Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) seems to read the audiences mind by exclaiming ""The city is flying were fighting an army of robots and I have a bow and arrow"" But to Whedons credit Hawkeye doesnt come off as outmatched and out of place this time. He holds his own against his much more powerful allies Thor (Chris Hemsworth) or Captain America (Chris Evans). The plot of Age of Ultron which is dense only because it builds so much on plot elements from previous films boils down to a prototypical Big Bad the sentient robot Ultron (voiced by James Spader) who is also prone to wisecracking and wants to you know destroy the world. There is some irony inherent in the story that the villain was an accidental creation of our heroes efforts to create a preemptive defense against future invaders from another dimension but Whedon doesnt explore that theme too deeply even though it will figure heavily in the upcoming Captain America Civil War saga. Age of Ultron does plant the seeds of contention between Tony Stark and Steve Rogers who dont always agree on their approach to protecting mankind For comic fans who know whats coming those scenes stand out in a movie that for the most part is marking time. Age of Ultron which occasionally grazes the cosmic dimensions that the Avengers will encounter in 2018s Infinity War still suffers from the inevitable bloat that comes with having almost 10 protagonists. Scarlett Johanssons Black Widow remains a formidable opponent in a fight but the movie has no idea what to do with her during the intervals between throwdowns other than to push her into a half-hearted romance with Bruce Banner that stops the movie and adds needlessly to the 141-minute running time (the issues their subplot raises belong in a different less frivolous story). Whedon fares better when he keeps his heroes together such as a scene in which theyre relaxing knocking back drinks and taking turns trying in vain to lift Thors hammer as the buff Asgardian looks on and laughs (only Black Widow declines to try because shes a woman and thus the smartest Avenger). Late in the film comes a terrific throwaway gag that pays off the hammer bit with an enormous laugh a testament to the careful attention to detail Whedon uses as a writer. Age of Ultron wont endure the way great genre movies do because theres little here worth revisiting. For all its plot convolutions the story is flimsy and generic a set-up to much bigger things to come and the spectacle requires 3D glasses and a giant screen for maximum enjoyment. Watching it at home or on a tablet just wont be the same. Age of Ultron is a contraption as mechanical as its eponymous villain but if the film indeed ends up marking Whedons exit he will have left the bar set at an impressive height. Instead of trying to elevate his source material or leaven it with importance the way Christopher Nolan did with the Dark Knight pictures Whedon embraces the comics pulpy colorful playful roots and he doesnt try to convert the uninitiated either (anyone wandering into this movie without a working knowledge of whats come before will be as lost as someone trying to start on Game of Thrones by watching this weeks episode). Whedon knows this is all nonsense but it can be great fun too. Age of Ultron is all rush and sensation with little substance. But what a feeling.

Mine is the Vision. Hes not an A-list Avenger like Thor or Captain America but he has a ridiculous number of superpowers hes superstrong he can fly he can walk through walls and shoot beams out of a gem on his forehead. Also hes married to the Scarlet Witch. The Vision is never going to hold down his own solo movie--probably because hes weird-looking and an android--but he does make an appearance in Avengers Age of Ultron the sequel to Marvels vast Olympian franchise-melding The Avengers which made more money than any other film in history except Titanic and Avatar. You can see why theres something decadent and supersaturated about these movies like you almost cant believe the munificence of a Hollywood that would put Iron Man and the Hulk (and the Vision) in the same movie. Like the first one Avengers Age of Ultron was written and directed by Joss Whedon among whose many virtues is an indelible infallible touch with character which is important because in Ultron he has to introduce them at a furious rate. In addition to the six regular Avengers--and irregulars like Nick Fury War Machine and the Falcon--we get not only the Vision but also the sorcerous Scarlet Witch and her twin brother Quicksilver who has superspeed. Or as one character describes them ""Hes fast shes weird."" Then theres Ultron himself a super-intelligent borderline indestructible robot created with good intentions that have gone awry--hes now trying to wipe out humanity. Physically Ultron looks like an animate damascened suit of armor; having no nose he also bears a family resemblance to Voldemort. As voiced by James Spader Ultron displays a finely honed mordant sense of humor. Responding to a noble idealistic speech he begins ""I cant physically throw up in my mouth ..."" If anything Whedons writing is almost too sharp. The characters are so finely drawn and verbally quick (they name-check Banksy and Eugene ONeill) that they seem to belong to a different universe than the cartoonish one they find themselves in. Theyre smarter than it but in order for the plot to get rolling Tony Stark has to make the rookie mistake of trying to create a superpowered artificial intelligence using a gem embedded in the staff of Loki god of evil. You can see Stark actively struggling to convince even himself that this is a good idea. Likewise no one ever seems quite sure why the nonsuperpowered merely handy Avengers Black Widow and Hawkeye are in the group at all since theyre constantly in danger of being squashed like bugs. With Ultron Whedon has the opposite problem hes got too much power. Ultron represents a new trend the cloud-based villain. While he has an impressive robotic hardware body his essence is software so he can spread anywhere on the Internet more or less instantly and copy himself at will. Pulverizing his body doesnt do much good he sheds bodies the way we shed old iPhones. To give the Avengers even a fighting chance Whedon has to keep Ultron in shackles like a robotic Harrison Bergeron. He makes Ultron fond of small talk and sentimentally attached to the human form--we know what killer robots look like and they dont look like Ultron they look like Predator drones. Ultron doesnt back himself up conscientiously either. Hes not even fully wireless---several times we see him tethered by what look like Ethernet cables. He pulls his punches never mind trying to hack the worlds nuclear arsenal why doesnt he hack the Avengers jet? Surely there are a couple of zero-day flaws in the firmware. Or never mind that--he ought to hack Iron Mans suit. A real Ultron would be completely distributed and systemic the way real-life supervillains are climate change Ebola political inertia economic inequality. You couldnt smash them with Thors hammer--or you could but it wouldnt do any good. That would be truly scary. But not nearly as fun to watch.

To wit theres these Infinity Stones the most powerful destructive forces in the universe and someone is out to get them. Whedon is mostly up to the task of keeping all his brightly colored balls in the air though hes not above using some glib speechmaking and ridiculous action to divert your attention and keep your questions at bay. As for Whats Now after the alien invasion of the earlier film swaggering tech genius Tony Stark decides that the whole planet could use a suit of armor that is an army of robot defenders. Oh and he needs to give them artificial intelligence; that way everybody can stop being superheroes and get down to the business of ordinary life. Needless to say things dont work out as planned and the rest of the film is spent trying to correct the mistake of building a smartbot who has the good sense to ask ""Whats the point of fragile fleshy fallen humanity?"" But getting back to that bit about ordinary life the film is very friendly to families as the reason superfolk do the cool stuff they do. (And messed-up families are the reason other superfolk do the bad stuff they do the inhuman Ultron hates his all-too-human daddy and a couple of orphans have it in for the guy who made them that way.) But ""friendly to families"" does not quite equal ""family-friendly"" theres a self-conscious upping of Adult Language and Themes. How else will you know to take seriously all the talk about Who We Are and What We Want From Life? Still did we really need a ""hide the zucchini"" joke about the Hulk? 2015. -- Matthew Lickona This movie is not currently in theaters.

James Spader supplies the voice behind the Marvel series latest super villain in ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" directed by Joss Whedon. Image 12 of 12 How Joss Whedon messed up Avengers Age of Ultron 1 / 12 Back to Gallery A horrible future looms before us in ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" with machines making war on humankind in order to take over the Earth. Yet thats not nearly so depressing as the other battle taking place onscreen in which computers take over movies to make war on cinema. Adapted from the Marvel comics the film was written and directed by Joss Whedon a human being with wit feeling and an appreciation of art. Here and there he tries to let us know this like a prisoner sneaking out a coded message A wisecrack here an unexpected cultural reference there a few bars of Maria Callas singing ""Casta Diva"" over the soundtrack. But amid the massiveness and din these little smothered attempts are at best pathetic an attempt to trick the devil while inside the devils pocket. ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" is supercharged and lifeless frenetic and stone-cold dead a barrage of action scenes that look fake yet make you wonder if fake is the new real. It was once a mark of shame to make scenes that reminded audiences of computer screens but that may be the coming aesthetic. Meanwhile every so often between bombardments theres a gesture in the direction of explaining things -- a few glibly spoken lines in scientific jargon. But its a safe bet that no one watching really knows whats going on. Yet heres the thing Maybe were not meant to know. Maybe all were supposed to understand is that theres a bad computer making war on some exceptionally strong humans and then let the games begin. Bring on the destruction. Bring on the quick cutting -- a new shot every second. Whedon may think hes given us a vision of the apocalypse but theres no need to worry about the end of the world. The real worry here is the end of filmmaking as art. Related Stories Joss Whedon wrung out by new Avengers Robert Downey Jr. walks out on TV interview Marvel is the best studio in Hollywood. Accept it. It starts as all bad action movies do in the thick of conflict. The Avengers -- a band of various superheroes -- are fighting somebody but you dont exactly know whom right away. But does that really matter? Just the sight of them ought to inspire a rooting interest just as the mere spectacle of things blowing up should stir the blood -- or at least thats the idea. Soon the archvillain is revealed. Its Ultron a rogue robot operating out of Sokovia a fictional country in Central Europe. Ultron is the ultimate in artificial intelligence able to think and reason like a human but with an ambition to eradicate human life from the planet. The Avengers are the only obstacle between him and success and so he takes the war to them. The battle scenes in ""Age of Ultron"" are especially interminable because every superhero must get a chance to do something. So we get Captain America (Chris Evans) throwing his shield Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) riding a motorcycle the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) losing his temper Thor (Chris Hemsworth) swinging his hammer Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) shooting arrows and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) making jokes. Each time Downey speaks as Iron Man we get a close-up of him supposedly from inside the iron suit. The sight takes us out of the moment as it looks like nothing more than an actor on a soundstage spouting bland one-liners into a camera. In addition to the usual crew there are two new additions the brother-sister pair of Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) who moves fast and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) who makes what looks like tai chi gestures that cause things to explode. Thats a whole lot of shtick to cram into each action scene but dont worry Whedon takes his time so that everyone gets a fair chance to bore the audience to death. It doesnt help that theyre all fighting the same creature. Ultron has spawned an army of mini Ultrons so we get to see lots of actors kicking and flailing against an easily imagined blue screen. The first half of ""Age of Ultron"" is mired in tans and browns. No matter what the interior or exterior -- from outdoor scenes to Hawkeyes farmhouse -- everything has a tan murk about it darkened further by the 3-D glasses. Later things switch to violet before brightening up for the finish. Without being specific incidentally the ending is flat because the story lacks a single focal point of tension. The movie is about 90 percent commotion and you cant really identify the climax until the commotion stops. At that point you can say ""That last thing. That mustve been it."" Whedon has talked about retiring from the ""Avengers"" franchise with this installment. I hope he does. At this point we can still say hes too good for this kind of movie -- but not if he does it again. By the way ""Age of Ultron"" is not the only film out there warning of the threat of artificial intelligence.

Its a little too much of everything -- except the banter between battles which is the best part.Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff in ""Avengers Age of Ultron.""(Photo Marvel Studios)Story Highlights3.5 stars (out of 5)There is much to like about ""Avengers Age of Ultron.""There was much to love about ""The Avengers"" and therein lies the difference. Even though we had been warmed up for the first movie with stand-alone Marvel-hero movies (""Iron Man"" ""Thor"" ""The Incredible Hulk"") director Joss Whedons 2012 film felt incredibly fresh. That novelty is obviously missing in ""Ultron."" Cant be helped. And there are a couple of moments that really grab you in the new film. Just not as many as before.Which is ironic because there are a lot of moments period -- 141 of them to be exact. And lots of characters. And lots and lots and lots of action. Its everything all the time.Right from the start in fact The movie begins with a huge action scene involving all the core Avengers Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) Thor (Chris Hemsworth) Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) Captain America (Chris Evans) Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). Theyre in an East European country called Sokovia closing in on the mountain compound of Baron Wolfgang von Strucker (Thomas Kretschmann) a last representative of Hydra the organization of bad guys.He proves easy enough to dispatch but the Avengers dont get him until the twins he has been genetically developing Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) are loosed upon the world. ""Hes fast and shes weird"" is the way one character describes them and thats pretty spot-on.RELATED Avengers Age of Ultron kicks off a big summer on-screen.The twins also have a giant chip on their shoulder courtesy of Tony Starks shady past before he became Iron Man and they set in motion the events that will lead to the creation of the ultimate villain (the Big Bad in Whedon terms) Ultron.Ultron is the brainchild of Stark who envisions a global peacekeeping force powered by artificial intelligence. It all goes haywire of course. (Surely someone as smart as Stark has read ""Frankenstein."")Ultrons plans dont quite track with Starks initiative; the new creation sets out to increase his power in the form of bigger and better robotic frames and you know destroy the world. (It is a superhero movie after all.) Hes a formidable villain but the best thing about him by far is his voice which belongs to James Spader. Hes perfect for the part the one actor who can go toe-to-toe with Downey in what at times amounts to a snark-off competition.James Spader provides the voice of Ultron in ""Avengers Age of Ultron."" (Photo Marvel Studios )The Avengers assemble heh-heh to try to stop Ultron. But theres more Black Widow and Hulk begin a romance when hes not trying to run from it. (He has a point -- thetemper might be a bit of a problem.) And Hawkeye who was largely absent in ""The Avengers"" gets the biggest back story a surprise wife (Linda Cardellini) and kids the physical embodiment of what most of the team wants but cant have.There is plenty of humor which is expected and its smart at one point Iron Man complains that he has had a long day ""Like Eugene ONeill long."" There also are a couple of touching moments. The best addition is Olsen; she gives Scarlet Witch the requisite amount of pain to deal with as well as rage and heartbreak. And she doesnt look stupid casting goofy spells or whatever they are.Its odd in some ways that theres so much action because although necessary in these movies its the weakest element. The climactic battle in which score after score of robotic bad guys swarm a city looks too much like the climactic battle in the previous movie. And its not like we dont have a good idea what the outcome will be.No the banter between battles is whats best as when the group drunkenly tries to figure out how to lift Thors hammer (a bit that will have a powerful payoff later). Theres not enough of that and too much of everything else.And yet ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" is still well worth seeing. Its smarter than most of the summer blockbusters that come our way and if its exhausting you certainly get your moneys worth in terms of having information visual and otherwise thrown at you.But its also the second of at least four movies and it plays like it. Sure its bigger than the first film and that one wasnt exactly small. But bigger isnt always better. Sometimes its just good enough.Avengers Age of Ultron3.5 stars (out of 5)Director Joss Whedon.Cast Robert Downey Jr. Chris Evans Mark Ruffalo.Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi action violence and destruction and for some suggestive comments.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Rated PG-13 (profanity action violence). Opens Thursday night. Writing and directing ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" Joss Whedon proves he has a superpower of his own mediocrity. If he were the star of a comic-book film hed be called something like Zinc Man or Captain Belgium. Not that the film is a disaster. It has enough whammo-kerblammo high-stakes standoffs and breezy banter that if you work really hard to fool yourself you might mistake it for a pleasing blockbuster in much the same way that Tim Tebows mom probably thinks hes a good quarterback. Butt-kicking superhero squad the Avengers return to battle viral baddies in ""Age of Ultron"" but the muddled plot and lame jokes are anything but exceptional. Above from left Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) Captain America (Chris Evans) Thor (Chris Hemsworth) Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner).Photo Marvel This time after a random shootout in a snowy forest Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) captures the magical scepter of Loki -- Thors evil brother -- from the villainous group Hydra and it starts to mess with his mind. He accidentally unleashes a pernicious force of artificial intelligence -- Ultron (voiced by James Spader) -- that is able to take shape as either a cyborg who fires lethal sarcasm in every direction or a computer virus that threatens the info grid including the nuclear codes. Goal? World destruction. Like some dark lord of Conde Nast Ultron has a couple of naive interns on staff supertwins Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) and Pietro (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) -- shes weird hes fast. Their parents were killed by one of Tony Starks bombs so they want vengeance against the Avengers. Whedon keeps approaching ideas but every time he does so he leaves a flaming bag of dog poop on the doorstep rings the bell and runs away tittering. Is Stark being overcome by his arrogance and are he and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) using their scientific expertise to seize dictatorial powers over the others? Maybe but now lets just have everyone goof off at a cocktail party where they try to pick up Thors (Chris Hemsworth) hammer. The Avengers take on a new villain -- the artificially intelligent Ultron -- in this highly anticipated comic-book sequel.Photo Marvel (c) 2014 Are Wandas mind-control techniques giving such spooky vibes to Thor Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Captain America (Chris Evans) that theyll all turn against one another? Nah because its the kind of brainwashing that wears off like a couple of margaritas. The way Whedon sprinkles would-be intellectual references -- ""Peace in our time""; ""Upon this rock I will build my church""; a nod to Nietzsche -- without pursuing any of them suggests not a guy who reads but a guy who watches ""Jeopardy"" Whenever things threaten to get scary he undermines himself with a dull joke or a one-liner cribbed from ""The Big Book of Catchphrases 2003 Edition"" ""Not so much"" ""Not a fan"" ""D - - k move."" Whedon might be the last professional writer ever to type the words ""Do the math"" and chuckle at his handiwork. Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) the worlds most boring superhero even interrupts a save-the-world scene to chat about his home-renovation plans. So Hes not terribly tuned in to the supposedly thrilling action? The sentiment is catching. Scriptwise its all very tame and small very jokey and cute very ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer."" Yet in its many extravagant fight scenes ""Ultron"" manages to look costly and cheap at the same time like a Donald Trump building. The computer graphics are state of the art only if you think the standard in CGI was set by ""Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance."" Chris Evans is back as Captain America (inset) and Scarlett Johanssons Black Widow (above) faces off with new nemeses such as the witchy Wanda.Photo Jay Maidment Moreover the climax -- set in a grim aggressively gray Eastern European country (""Sokovia"") that Ultron lifts from the Earth and dangles in the air -- is so dismal and lacking in character that its the functional equivalent of the folding metal chair thrown into the ring in a pro wrestling bout. Ultron in the end isnt a scary ineradicable virus like terrorism but simply the leader of an incompetent robot army trying to detonate a whirring gizmo like a globe-imperiling game of Kick the Can. ""Ultron"" is full of random action scenes such as one in which the Hulk destroys a city and its as meaningful (and as easily explained) as a toddlers tantrum. Its a movie that explains to us ""Humans are odd. They think order and chaos are somehow opposites."" Deep bro but if youre trying to tell us the cat ran across your keyboard while you were typing this thing up just say so.

The sequel to 2012s ""The Avengers"" needed to advance the story to keep things fresh (and not get lost in the logjam of 21st-century superhero movies) -- and it did. We get increased depth in the characters making them more likable. Theres even a bigger theme at work about the inevitable fall of a society thats too smart for its own good.But -- wow theres a lot going on in this movie. If Disneys goal was to make people feel like they need to see this more than once then mission accomplished. Chris Evans left as Captain America/Steve Rogers and Chris Hemsworth as Thor in a scene of the new film ""Avengers Age Of Ultron."" (Jay Maidment/Disney/Marvel via AP) The good news is that ""Ultron"" is visually stunning and the dialogue and character dynamics make you feel like youre hanging around old friends. Joss Whedon understands the human relationships in ""Ultron"" keep it from becoming a Transformers movie.And of course theres that villain -- Ultron voiced sneeringly by James Spader. He may be a robot but theres nothing mechanical about his aura of evil. Ultron was created by Iron Mans alter ego Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.). Unbeknownst to his teammates he developed Ultron to do much of the Avengers work. However Stark made this creation a bit too well. Ultron develops a God complex decides humanity has to go then gets to work. Advertisement With the assistance of a pair of Eastern European twins who possess superpowers and a grudge against Stark (Pietro/Quicksilver played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Wanda/Scarlet Witch played by a surprisingly riveting Elizabeth Olsen) Ultron builds a robot army and another synthetic being whose personality is ripped from Starks computer sidekick J.A.R.V.I.S. (Paul Bettany who finally appears in the flesh after doing Iron Man-related voice work for several movies).Adding some humanity to the convoluted -- yet somehow enjoyable -- action is a budding romance between Natasha/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). Of course theyre way too busy killing robots to start talking about exchanging house keys but there is some talk of running off together. And watching Natasha cooing to calm down Mr. Angrypants is strangely touching.Another new subplot involves the alter ego of Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). Basically a throwaway hero in the first film Renner gets a chance to stretch out his character this time around making it seem as if he might even get his own stand-alone film at some point -- an idea that seemed impossible three years ago.So the action ends up overseas again where Ultron has built his evil robot assembly line near a village hes equipped with rocket lifts. Inspired by Earths past extinction events Ultron wants to lift this enormous chunk of land up into the atmosphere and drop it which were led to believe would destroy humanity. Again seeking to balance the wild action Whedon has our heroes spend a disproportionate amount of time evacuating the villagers as opposed to those other superhero movies in which cities are leveled without much consideration to the puny humans living there. With Marvel announcing years worth of superhero films in advance one knows there isnt much personal loss by the end of ""Avengers Age of Ultron."" But we do see a way to freshen the concept for future movies (I would love to see a stand-alone film for Scarlet Witch and her cool purple-wispy mind-bending power). With all the subplots and unexplainable events in ""Ultron"" it couldve been a real mess (come to think of it it was). But lovable characters just the right amount of humor and spectacular action make ""Ultron"" a worthy bridge to whatever happens next in The Avengers universe.Contact Tony Hicks at Facebook.com/BayAreaNewsGroup.TonyHicks or Twitter.com/tonyhicks67.Print Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Review Holocaust haunts family in The GatheringReview In Hearts of Palm bumbling corporation aims to plunder paradiseReview In Bad Moms fast food and booze spike the stress of motherhood Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

VPCThor (Chris Hemsworth) left Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) battle evil in Avengers Age Of Ultron.(Photo Marvel)Director Joss Whedon knows how to make a wryly funny action-packed extravaganza as he proved with 2012s The Avengers.So why did he overstuff the 21/2-hour sequel?After a couple of hours Avengers Age of Ultronbegins to feel padded (1/2 out of four; opens in select cities April 30 nationwide May 1).Cutting Whedon some slack its an all-star superhero saga that will likely please diehard Marvel devotees and many fans of the first film. But for the less dialed in the fun of watching these top-tier heroes save the universe diminishes with the passage of time.Sure this is the A Team of comic book superstars but overextended sequences dont make them any more impressive.Whedon seem to have forgotten the old maxim Always leave them wanting more. During the final 20 minutes we cant keep from wanting less.USA TODAYNew Avengers Saving the world squabblingIts not as if audiences will be starving for Marvel blockbusters The company has comic book movies scheduled for release through 2028 adding to an already substantial canon. This summer alone will see two more Ant-Man and Fantastic Four.Before Ultron hits the tipping point of franchise fatigue however the comic banter between its heroic superstars has a sharp snappiness. Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) decides that a futuristic robot will help keep the world safe. So he creates Ultron (voiced by James Spader) as a sentient artificially intelligent peacekeeper. But his plan fueled by hubris goes awry. Ultron proves a super-foe who believes safety will be achieved only when humanity -- and the Avengers -- are destroyed.But earlier Stark had persuaded Bruce Banner/the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) to help him with his A.I. creation leaving the rest of the Avengers out of the equation despite their all-for-one philosophy.The sequel is darker than the first Avengers with its exploration of acting unilaterally and playing God as well as its look at our heroes deep-seated fears.Where the first Avengers had a giddy almost innocent exuberance this next chapter feels bogged down by darker elements and an excess of cast members.USA TODAYMeet the new Avengers on the blockNew to the universe and adding more peril for the heroic crusaders are the genetically enhanced Maximoff twins clairvoyant Wanda/Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and speedy Pietro/Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson).Sometimes the Avengers -- the core group being Iron Man the Hulk Captain America (Chris Evans) Thor (Chris Hemsworth) Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) -- come off like a dysfunctional family.Spaders voicing of Ultron sounds like a blend of Tom Hardys Bane in The Dark Knight Rises and Michael Keaton as the titular character in Birdman. The villainous Ultron is overbearing but not very intriguing. USA TODAYPaul Bettanys Avengers Vision costume really hurts his headWhedons strong suits are snarky fast-paced humor and charismatic characters and those two elements give Ultron its greatest appeal. A romance brews between Black Widow and Banner but its too bad the primary female superhero is relegated to yearning over a guy with explosive bouts of anger. Its especially disappointing given Whedons talent for creating complex female characters (a la his seminal TV show Buffy the Vampire Slayer). Although the plot has moments of murkiness the spectacle is substantial and the witty company delightful. If only the editing had been tighter. 336 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 19 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1yRqqsK,http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/04/22/avengers-age-of-ultron-review/26150575/,200,avengersageofultron29,avengersageofultron,usatoday
"Avengers Age of Ultron reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up An Unstoppable Force (Joss Whedons Imagination) Meets an Immovable Object (Marvel/Disney) An Unstoppable Force (Joss Whedons Imagination) Meets an Immovable Object (Marvel/Disney) Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.April 28 2015 336 PM Avengers Age of Ultron You know I cant totally support Joss Whedons avenging. By Dana Stevens Captain America (Chris Evans) in Avengers Age of Ultron. Courtesy of Jay Maidment/Marvel This is the dawning of the Age of Ultron--the age in which I plan to breathe deep and just let superhero movies be what they are rather than stressing out about what their burger chain-like sameness might have to say about the state of American cinema. Or world cinema. Or for that matter the whole global economy with its interlinked chains of production and consumption entertainment and marketing all converging in the years first Marvel blockbuster Avengers Age of Ultron which arrives this week in the U.S. with more than 200 million in foreign box office already in the bank accompanied by a whirling red-and-silver cyclone of fast food tie-ins and product placements and Disney interactive exhibits. (See how not stressed out I am already?) Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. If Age of Ultron is a chain hamburger its one turned out by a maker who cares deeply about the integrity of his product. Joss Whedon who helmed the wildly successful first Avengers in 2012 could be thought of as the Danny Meyer of franchise movie production. And Age of Ultron does light up a few times every hour (of which there are nearly 21/2) with the bright clever dialogue and attention to intimate human exchanges proper to Whedons genre-shifting TV series over the past two decades--not to mention the very different other film he directed in 2012 an effervescent no-budget Much Ado About Nothing shot in Whedons backyard. A starkly sad profile that recently went up on BuzzFeed makes clear Whedons deep knowledge of and commitment to the Marvel comic book universe--and also the grinding corporate and artistic pressures that for now at least have led him to feel finished with his work at the studio. Other filmmakers--the brothers Joe and Anthony Russo who made the latest Captain America movie--have committed to co-direct the upcoming two-part installment Avengers Infinity War (youre telling me). Age of Ultron then shows what happens when an unstoppable force (Joss Whedons imagination) meets an immovable object (the Disney/Marvel behemoth). And the result is indeed paradoxical a crashy overlong FX-driven blockbuster thats capable of morphing Hulk-to-Banner style into a loose-limbed ensemble comedy about collaboration flirtation and friendship. At least until the next threat to the universe raises its artificially intelligent robotic head and the boom-boom-smash starts up again. Advertisement I cant say it wasnt a pleasure to re-encounter the charismatic gallery of principal players whom we first come upon in the midst of an assault on a fortress in the fictional country of Sokovia. In a long unbroken traveling shot--if concepts like ""unbroken"" ""traveling"" or ""shot"" have any meaning in the post-Gravity age of digital cinematography--every major Avenger gets opportunities to showcase his or her villain-whomping specialty. Steve ""Captain America"" Rogers (Chris Evans) deflects bullets and bad guys alike with his pleasingly chunky super-shield. Thor (Chris Hemsworth)--he just goes by the one name because hes the Norse god Thor--gets creative with his all-powerful space hammer. Bruce ""the Hulk"" Banner (Mark Ruffalo) overcomes his moral aversion to violence to get in some old-school green-fisted smashing. Master archer Clint ""Hawkeye"" Barton (Jeremy Renner) pulls out his trusty quiver and goes full Errol Flynn on the enemys ass before sustaining a wound that takes him out of the battle. Natasha ""Black Widow"" Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) just sort of ... fights really well I guess with martial-arts kicks and flips that demonstrate the surprising stretch factor of what looks like an uncomfortably snug black leather catsuit. And Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) flies over the whole proceedings in his Iron Man exoskeleton issuing warnings directives and words of encouragement to his colleagues like an airborne life coach. A scene from Avengers Age of Ultron. From left Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) Captain America (Chris Evans) Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Thor (Chris Hemsworth). Courtesy of Marvel The fortress theyre raiding hides the secret headquarters of Hydra the retro-Nazi organization led by Baron Wolfgang von Strucker (Thomas Kretschmann). The gang makes short work of Hydra HQ but they neglect to capture two of Struckers latest human weapons the super-twins Pietro Maximoff aka Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Wanda Maximoff aka the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) who as children lost their parents to a weapon manufactured by Stark Industries and have since sworn revenge on both Stark and his fellow Avengers. If all those characters proper names their super-alter-egos names and the names of the actors who play them are already starting to blur into one long word string (Silverhawk Downey-Johanssworth von Ruffaloff?) perhaps you should go boil some water for tea because there are more names to come. Samuel L. Jackson plays the Avengers cranky eyepatch-sporting former commander Nick Fury. James Spader (via voice over and motion capture) is the nihilistic artificial intelligence-program-turned-world menacer known as Ultron. Anthony Mackie is the winged do-gooder Sam ""The Falcon"" Wilson. Paul Bettany (who has for years been voicing Iron Mans polite computer helpmate J.A.R.V.I.S.) shows up late in the film as a floating eggplant-hued thingamabob known only as the Vision. Plus in roles of (as far as I can tell) a superpowerless nature there are Stellan Skarsgard Linda Cardellini Julie Delpy Andy Serkis and others. Age of Ultron shows what happens when an unstoppable force (Joss Whedons imagination) meets an immovable object (the Disney/Marvel behemoth). Age of Ultron couldnt be more crammed with weapons-grade acting talent. And though the movie often feels as if its writing and its filmmaking are in opposition to each other--that Whedon is trying to sneak in more character development and incidental humor than the forms strictly proscribed structure will allow--nearly every major character gets at least one good scene and a few minor ones do too. Advertisement Thats the added value you get from hiring a talent like Whedon (though the mere words added value with their prioritization of the profit margin over individual auteurship again remind us that its Disney not the director that wields the final say in corporate productions at this scale). As a true comics fan whos also a keen observer of human nature Whedon is capable of writing dialogue that reminds us of whats not just stereotypical but archetypical about these overfamiliar characters. Men who turn green and giant when theyre angry. Women who shoot mind-controlling forcefields out of their fingertips. A World War II soldier who was frozen for 80 years against his will and wound up outliving everyone he ever loved. Scientific believability be damned these are rich character conflicts to explore--a simple truth comic books seem able to communicate more powerfully than their filmed offspring especially as the latter become ever more beholden to global consumer demand. When they get a minute or two off from cosmos-saving Whedons Avengers seem more like misfit drama majors than brooding demigods. Theyre ruefully conscious of their own celebrity/freak status and the way their enhanced abilities have deprived them of normal personal lives. A languid early party sequence in which we start to get a sense of the gangs competitive bonding rituals gets interrupted far too soon by a would-be world-destroyer but I for one would have been up for at least 10 more minutes of cocktails and banter. A will-they-or-wont-they? romance plot between Banner and Natasha which at first seems contrived quickly gets pretty steamy and not just because one postshower scene affords a welcome glimpse of the unshaven chest that once led a friend and I to dub the actor ""Ruffalo the Fluffy Buffalo."" And as the long-suffering pregnant wife of the arrow-wielding Hawkeye Linda Cardellini gets and delivers perfectly the best line in a film replete with good ones ""You know I totally support your avenging."" Top Comment I read somewhere cant remember where that one of the reasons Whedon decided not to do the next one is because the studio insisted in adding so many characters in order to facilitate more spin-offs and he wasnt able to...  More... Join In Ive heard some critics wondering whether the laugh that line got (a big one at my screening) was intentional or not. All I can say is those who doubt it was must never have watched an episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Ive only seen a few myself but enough to tell that that shows unique tone has to do with the way it confidently mixes deft genre tribute with earnest emotional engagement. Thats the kind of delicate brushwork that can easily get lost on this big a canvas. Im glad Whedon got to achieve his childhood dream of becoming a creative force in the Marvel comic universe thats long been dear to him and I hope he socked away enough money while doing so to pursue many more dream projects in the future. But as Avengers Age of Ultron lumbered toward its generic sequel-teasing conclusion I wanted to cheer on its creators decision to flee the franchise the way one embattled Avenger late in the film exhorts an imperiled Sokovian boy to make his escape by pointing in the direction of the rescue vessels waiting to evacuate the city and shouting ""Run Run"" Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Monday Apr. 27 2015 253PM EDT Last updated Monday Apr. 27 2015 253PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Joss Whedon Written by Joss Whedon Starring Robert Downey Jr. Chris Hemsworth Mark Ruffalo Jeremy Renner Classification PG Year 2015 Country USA Language English In 2012 the movie The Avengers accomplished something almost superheroic A movie that was the result of a corporate collaboration with a half-dozen characters and a mess of backstories turned out to be a smart lively film with a lot of personality. It also became the third-highest grossing movie in history after Avatar and Titanic. Video Video Stars come out for London premiere of Avengers Age of Ultron Once again in Avengers Age of Ultron writer-director Joss Whedon shows his considerable gifts for multicharacter air traffic control in a massive 3-D spectacle while demonstrating reserves of insouciance. In an era when the phrase ""big-screen entertainment"" sounds quaint Whedon offers 21st-century image-spinning of high complexity and commitment to craft. Action scenes shift fluidly between anxious partial closeups mammoth spectacle shaky-cam realism and woozy fantasy in rapid combinations.For degree of difficulty Whedons accomplishments earn respect. The ""Marvel Universe"" of Stan Lee and Jack Kirbys comic books already offers a spaghetti mountain of narrative strands compiled from a half-century of comics including former Nazis Norse gods supernatural creatures and magic ""infinity stones"" and it can all look incredibly silly if it ever stops moving.That said Whedon cant quite work the same miracle twice. Age of Ultron also bears the familiar stretch marks characteristic of middle movies in franchise series. This bridging movie has to cover a long span Avengers Infinity War parts one and two arent due until May of 2018 and 2019. Theres a lot going on. New characters are introduced. There are quiet scenes designed to change up the rhythm and provide a few strokes suggesting psychological depth. Then theres a multiplication of new threats and the de rigueur kickass climax that have to be added before the lid can be jammed on the over-stuffed box.One shortcut Whedon employs is tossing away most of the expositional baggage assuming that the fan base already knows the backstories or doesnt really care. This is essentially the hot tub time machine approach to a far-fetched premise Dont ask jump in.The movie begins in the midst of a hectic Eastern European forest battle as the six returning Avengers - Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) Bruce Banner/ Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) - seize an outpost of the terrorist organization Hydra run by the Nazi Baron Wolfgang von Strucker (Thomas Kretschmann) and acquire a supernatural sceptre previously owned by the villainous Loki.During the fight we are introduced to two new villains the experimental mutant brother and sister team of Pietro and Wanda Maximoff (Aaron-Taylor Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen) who will later become the speedster Quicksilver and reality-warping psychic Scarlet Witch. The latter can induce customized nightmares and visions for enemies a trick that undermines the Avengers group confidence and allows Whedon to throw in some flashback/fantasy sequences.At the end of the first battle the victorious Avengers repair to the bunker for cocktails banter and superhero games (who can wield Thors hammer?). There are some tentative romantic vibes between the sultry Natasha and the nervous Banner who tends to avoid moments of emotional arousal.Meanwhile Stark has discovered an ""artificial intelligence"" in a gem in a sceptre. Stark the former arms merchant who is always making impetuous Faustian trade-offs ignores the Avengers collective decision-making rules and pushes Banner to help him implant the artificial intelligence in a new ""Ultron"" defence system a ""suit of armour around the world"".Ultron woozily comes to life and gives himself a robot body (his voice wonderfully provided by James Spader sounding louche and growly like a beat poet with a hangover). The very literal-minded machine which has been programmed to produce peace on Earth decides the best solution is to eliminate the planets major source of violence - human beings. Ultron crashes the Avengers party and leaves everyone rattled.The chastened warriors retreat to Hawkeyes prairie farmhouse and meet his wife (Linda Cardellini) who assures her husband ""You know I totally support your avenging.""). In this rustic homestead the Avengers lick their wounds bicker and plan their counter-attack except for Thor who flies off to ""find some answers."" A timely arrival of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) helps improve the splintering solidarity.When the Avengers eventually regroup - this would be about the films two-hour mark - theyre assisted by yet another helper an android with a red face and a perfect synthetic body that Ultra had designed for himself but it got uploaded with a nicer program. The thing is called Vision (suavely voiced by Paul Bettany) who we can expect to help carry those last two movies near the end of the decade on his meaty shoulders.By this point superhero fatigue has settled in. Gratitude is offered for Tony Starks quips which serve as a kind of apologetic commentary for the movies abounding excess.""Its been a long day - Eugene ONeill long"" Tony says at one point. We feel him. At 142 minutes the Age of Ultron really does feel like an age.

Share Tweet The best moments in The Avengers Marvels 2012 blockbuster crossover event werent the ones that pitted Earths mightiest heroes against an army of space invaders. They were the ones that gathered the characters in a room and pitted them against each other the inevitable war of the worlds delayed in favor of a much more entertaining war of words. This was the doing of Joss Whedon god among geeks hired by Marvel to pump some humor and life into the studios franchise-building strategy. What the writer-director saw in the plum gig beyond presumed bags of money was a chance to adopt another of his dysfunctional surrogate families. He treated the iconic characters loaned out to him for a couple of expensive hours like neurotic people trading as many barbs as blows. The result was a summer event movie that felt playful and idiosyncratic even as it skillfully delivered on its mandate to be just one part of a larger whole.But Whedon a true believer in the pleasures of comic-book storytelling is no miracle worker. In Avengers Age Of Ultron his busy return engagement to the Marvel Cinematic Universe the strain of multitasking begins to show. Even at two and a half hours this jam-packed sequel has little room for the kind of chatty downtime--the ""off"" moments Whedon excels at--that distinguished its predecessor. The film doesnt just reassemble the all-star ranks cramming sardonic billionaire Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) unfrozen super soldier Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) thunder god Thor (Chris Hemsworth) reformed assassin Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) flinty marksman Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and occasional giant green monster Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) back into the frame together. It also feeds supporting players borrowed from Marvels various solo outings into the franchise hub while devoting additional screen time to the appearance of brand new characters. Theres so much ground to cover here--so many introductions to make so much story to churn through so many gargantuan set pieces to mount--that the movie never really finds room to breathe.Whedon quick as ever with the quips hits the ground running The film opens in medias res taking a page from the James Bond series by dropping us into an Avengers mission already in progress. Storming the castle of Hydras last remaining heavy the good guys emerge with some enticing spoils among them the unexpected key to artificial intelligence. Stark it would seem is obsessed with the idea of creating ""a suit of armor around the world""--a kind of automated peacekeeping program that would allow him and his crime-fighting colleagues to take an indefinite vacation. The film underdramatizes the characters weariness but no matter; from his utopian retirement plan comes the titular villain a disturbed robot whose plan for world peace is considerably more genocidal than his creator would prefer. If there are no more people there are no more wars.Ultron with his muscular metallic frame and expressive alien features certainly looks cool. The film conceives of him as a kind of mad machine his glitches manifesting as homicidal insecurities and hes been voiced--quite recognizably despite the robotic filter--by James Spader who sinks his teeth into Whedons venomous dialogue. If Ultrons never quite as menacing as one might hope its possibly because the writer-director also wants him to be a force of dark comedy firing zingers nearly as relentlessly as his flyboy ""father."" Hes more interesting nonetheless than the other villains ""miracle"" twins The Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) divorced of their mutant backstory from the comics. Olsens telepath whose powers are numerous and a little vague invades the headspace of our heroes; a less overstuffed film might have treated these mind games more abstractly rather than simply sending Cap and company through Nightmare On Elm Street versions of their origin stories. As for speed demon Quicksilver he has his moments but none as remotely fun as what Bryan Singer did with the same character in X-Men Days Of Future Past. The film could use any sequence as joyful as that movies ""Time In A Bottle.""Age Of Ultron leaps across the globe as the Avengers hunt Ultron from New York City to Africa to Eastern Europe. Each new location is a demolition derby a model city to be leveled during another frantic set piece. Whedon gets the elastic physical reality of comic books and he knows how to frame a shot--like a late overhead image of the characters arranged in a circle attacking in every direction--as though it were a splash panel come to life. Theres also an admirable preoccupation here with collateral damage the director going out of his way to account for the civilians caught in the crossfire. But by the fifth digital showdown the endless CGI spectacle begins to feel a little numbing. The director might have learned something from the cleaner more practical action of The Winter Soldier--or were he granted an early look the bone-crunching fight choreography of Netflixs Daredevil.Here and there a lull arrives like a gift from Asgard. Whedon as if desperate to slow the pace for just a moment has the team lay low in a farmhouse where we learn a little more about Renners thinly sketched archer. Paul Bettany the voice of Starks computerized butler gets a few affecting moments of his own including a soulful climactic speech that artfully frames the films hastily posed questions about humanitys future. Less successful is the romance Whedon devises between Johanssons Black Widow and Ruffalos man-behind-the-Hulk; its a sweet idea pushed to the margins where just about every plot point that doesnt advance the overarching Marvel agenda must reside. Only when Age Of Ultron stops for air--dispensing briefly with the talk of gauntlets and the setup of future installments and the collision of ones and zeros--does the chemistry among these various marquee attractions re-spark. Theres a wonderful scene for example of everyone kicking back in civilian gear downing cold ones while trying to lift Thors great hammer. Whedon for a hot minute feels back in his element. Or maybe he can just relate struggling as he is to make something very heavy look light.

It is longer and looser in its story structure with a record running time for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is also much darker and more dangerous in its superhero character development with one of them getting exterminated. None of this however makes this movie better than its predecessor. In fact Age of Ultron is a visual jumble with too much pointless quick-cut battle action and not nearly enough comic book fun stuff. So while it is spectacular to behold and there are some new innovations onscreen it is mildly disappointing too. The clutter and the noise just gets to be a little tiresome wearing the viewer down physically and mentally. Part of the clutter is that Age of Ultron is a transition movie to the next two Avengers instalments the two-part Infinity War series coming in 2018 and 2019. Even though he is not going to be involved in them Age of Ultron writer-director Joss Whedon spends a lot of time setting up story and character points for those two sequels as well as for other Marvel movies featuring The Avengers characters. If all that weight of plot is the problem the relief in Age of Ultron is that there are some crazy-cool things going on. Chief among them is that the Ultron character is amazing. Not least because James Spader gives him a rich complex and nuanced voice as well as contributing to the appearance of his robot bodies. Ultron is a futuristic robot the best of what humans Tony Stark/Iron Man and Bruce Banner/The Hulk can create in a secret experiment designed to protect Planet Earth. Yet it is also the worst nightmare for humanity because the robots artificial intelligence runs amok and decides that the best way to protect the Earth is to exterminate all of mankind starting with The Avengers. Much like Frankensteins monster turning on its mad-science creator. This story is at the nuclear core of the new movie. The movie begins with an overblown battle sequence in the fictional Eastern European republic of Sokovia where The Avengers attack a Hydra lair and re-capture Lokis scepter that contains one of the powerful Infinity Stones. Stark and Banner work to use the scepters secrets to conjure Ultron who then turns on them plots to divide-and-conquer and generally causes mayhem around the world. The Avengers have to get past their own squabbles as well as the pressing dark cloud of their individual pasts to do anything heroic. In particular Banner/The Hulk and Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow are haunted by their inner demons while Starks existential crisis is deepening. All that psychological exploration is interesting for each character especially because some of the nightmarish visions are triggered by the mind games played on them by superhero Wanda Maximoff/The Scarlet Witch who is the twin sister of Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver. The twins are newly introduced and figure strongly in the Age of Ultron story as both conflicted villains and selfless heroes. But even the most interesting parts of the movie -- the visions the off-the-grid moments with The Avengers and the surprise twists in an Avengers love story -- are disjointed. Whedon is trying to do way too much for one movie to embrace at one once even with a running time of 141 minutes a record for a Marvel Cinematic Universe episode. All that said no one can quibble with the efforts of the actors. Marvel cast well and continues to expand their parts or add fascinating new players. Downey remains caustic and erudite as Stark managing to randomly reference both the playwright Eugene ONeill and the dice game Yahtzee. Mark Ruffalo enriches Banner/Hulk; no one can tell Scarlett Johansson was pregnant while filming as Romanoff/Black Widow; Jeremy Renner gets to cut loose as Clint Barton/Hawkeye; Chris Evans pushes Steve Rogers/Captain America along nicely; Chris Hemsworth is more contemporary now as Thor; Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen are excellent as the Maximoffs; Paul Bettany moves beyond J.A.R.V.I.S. into The Vision; Andy Serkis cameos as the arms dealer Ulysses Klaw; several familiar faces including Cobie Smulders Stellan Skarsgard Don Cheadle and Samuel L. Jackson reprise their roles; Linda Cardellini is a surprise human touch for Hawkeye; and Spader steals the show as Ultron even when he looks like a Terminator. Meanwhile sit through the credits. You will see how one villain (an uncredited Hollywood heavyweight) is mightily vexed. Cue the next sequels.

It is longer and looser in its story structure with a record running time for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is also much darker and more dangerous in its superhero character development with one of them getting exterminated. None of this however makes this movie better than its predecessor. In fact Age of Ultron is a visual jumble with too much pointless quick-cut battle action and not nearly enough comic book fun stuff.

"The Avengers Age of Ultron Review A Marvel but not quite a marvel - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review The Avengers Age of Ultron Avengers Age Of Ultron Marvel/TNS Chris Evans as Steve Rogers/Captain America in ""Avengers Age of Ultron."" Chris Evans as Steve Rogers/Captain America in ""Avengers Age of Ultron."" (Marvel/TNS) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Less of a Marvel more of a Pretty Good. When I say ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" wont disappoint a majority of its pre-sold culturally obligated fans around the world -- the world perpetually on the verge of extinction in the Marvel universe -- you know what I mean. You know what the movie promises and would be foolish or inept not to deliver.Action relentless and assaultive. Wisecracks numerous pretty sharp and evenly parceled out among Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man) Chris Hemsworth (Thor) Mark Ruffalo (Hulk) Chris Evans (Captain America though his are fewer and squarer) Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow) Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye) and so on. Three years ago writer-director Joss Whedons ""The Avengers"" turned out to be a sprightly wallop of an all-star superhero blockbuster. So why does the new one seem I dont know ... a little ... small?Its a strange thing. These are some of the biggest movies in the galaxy both in terms of production budget and grosses. The scale of the mayhem couldnt be much crazier if it tried. In one scene an entire Eastern European city is loosed from the ground and levitated by the antagonist (Ultron of the subtitle) with malicious species-ending intent. Humanity looks like a bad bet against the wily metal bot voiced by James Spader a creation of Tony Stark a.k.a. Iron Man and one of those secret projects that got out of hand in the name of preemptive strikes and strategic defense initiatives. Entertaining as much of ""Avengers 2"" is especially when its just hanging out with the gang in between scuffles (the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" lesson learned) Whedons picture meets expectations without exceeding them. Now that so many ""Avengers"" club members are busy with their own franchise management the ensemble ""Avengers"" movies have everything going for them and more. Whedon has said in interviews that he wanted the second ""Avengers"" bash to be ""bonkers.""  I suppose it is here and there especially when the mesmerizing mind-clouding Wanda Maximoff played by Elizabeth Olsen (Aaron Taylor-Johnson is her twin the superfast Pietro) messes with our heroes heads and the movie enters one subconscious nightmare vision after another. Some Chicago Avengers showings already sold out Fandango Tracy Swartz At least six Chicago-area theaters have sold out early showings of ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" which comes out Thursday night in select U.S. theaters according to the movie ticket sales site Fandango.

At least six Chicago-area theaters have sold out early showings of ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" which comes out Thursday night in select U.S. theaters according to the movie ticket sales site Fandango. Fandango is reporting theaters nationwide have sold out hundreds of ""Avengers"" showtimes including... (Tracy Swartz) The first halfs by far the stronger with Whedon nicely in command of his ever-expanding team. The romance between Black Widow and the Hulk complicated by the latters rage tendencies carves out a goodly portion of the scenario. Fruitfully so does the increased focus on Hawkeye (a bit of a write-off in the earlier ""Avengers"") and his family life.  The secret weapon in ""Avengers 2"" isnt Ultron or the glowing souvenir-shop tchotchke that brings the mystical floating Vision (capital V-Vision played by Paul Bettany) to life. No its Linda Cardellini supremely honest and un-self-consciously lovely in close-up in her farmhouse-idyll scenes with Renner. ""You know I totally support your avenging"" she tells her husband before he zooms off with his teammates again and while that line is one of Whedons better turns of phrase Cardellini rightly refuses to deliver it with a wink.Whedon remains a more interesting writer than director; I cant put my finger on it (a tough thing to admit on deadline) but is it something in his series television training even though that training led to some great notions and giddy mashups on ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" that confines Whedons visual sensibility? The action is plentiful and edited within an inch of a given sequences life for moderate-to-medium clarity and maximum painless pain if you get the contradiction. But increasingly in the second hour the close proximity of ravaged weeping extras and another round of quips gets a little weird. And the fights grind on. Rise of niche blockbusters a joy to behold Michael Phillips Already killing it in England Hong Kong Kazakhstan and beyond ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" opens in the U.S. with evening screenings Thursday and an official Friday bow. Expectations couldnt be larger. Its success is predestined; it will be one of those mass-market blockbusters that stockholders... Already killing it in England Hong Kong Kazakhstan and beyond ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" opens in the U.S. with evening screenings Thursday and an official Friday bow. Expectations couldnt be larger. Its success is predestined; it will be one of those mass-market blockbusters that stockholders... (Michael Phillips) Three years ago at ""The Avengers"" the crowd was giggling and already mentally preparing for a second go en masse. A similar pumped-up vibe filled the air at the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" screening I saw. Both of those pictures were a tick up from this one. On the other hand all ""Avengers 2"" had to be to be successful was ""not stinky"" and to offer moviegoers unlimited breadsticks. Or wait. Am I mixing up this  Marvel with the newest Olive Garden?

Photo Credit Marvel / TNS advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The superhero team must stop an artificial intelligence from destroying mankind. Rated PG-13. BOTTOM LINE Thin on story crowded with characters and padded with extraneous action. In other words a sure hit CAST Robert Downey Jr. Scarlett Johansson Mark Ruffalo Chris Hemsworth LENGTH 221 Giving the people what they want is the top priority of ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" a superhero free-for-all that contains almost nothing but ka-pows blammos and cheeky one-liners. The story in which our heroes square off against Ultron an artificial intelligence determined to destroy his creators is thinner than the gutter between two comic panels which is surely by design. Its another big-budget treat for fans who still havent tired of seeing major cities destroyed by caped demigods. The first ""Avengers"" from 2012 was an impressive juggling act by writer-director Joss Whedon who kept his eye on four very different franchise heroes. Robert Downey Jr.s snarky Iron Man clashed with Chris Evans sincere Captain America; Chris Hemsworths Thor provided deadpan comic relief; and everyone trod lightly around Mark Ruffalos Bruce Banner lest he explode into The Hulk. advertisement | advertise on newsday Theres more of that enjoyable interaction here but Whedons hands are too full. Between the countless action sequences he must introduce a poignant backstory for Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner still the series lowest-wattage presence) a budding attraction between Banner and Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and two mutant newcomers (Aaron Taylor-Johnson as the fleet-footed Quicksilver and Elizabeth Olsen as the mind-bending Scarlet Witch). Whedon doesnt drop any of these balls; he just spins them into a blur. If anyone stands out its James Spader as Ultron a sleek robot who can quote both Nietzsche and the Bible. Though Ultrons motion-capture visage robs us of seeing Spaders trademark smirk its audible in his voice honed during years of playing deliciously toxic characters such as those from 1981s ""Endless Love"" to NBCs ""The Blacklist."" Hes well-matched too by Paul Bettany the longtime voice of the computer Jarvis who becomes a benevolent consciousness called Vision and finally gets a body of his own. ""The Avengers Age of Ultron"" has the same finale as the first movie. In fact its the same finale from many a Marvel movie The heroes battle a horde of faceless bad guys while a doomsday device ticks away somewhere preferably up on a high point like a skyscraper or in this case a giant chunk of Eastern Europe that has been sent rising into the clouds. Maybe this general scenario defines the superhero genre just as the showdown defines the Western but its getting highly repetitive. MoviesBig movies out this summer The film ends with a sentence that given Marvels mapped-out release schedule for the next several years would seem to go without saying ""The Avengers Will Return.""

And Mrs. Hawkeye is OK with that really. ""You know"" she reassures her husband ""I totally support your Avenging."" Me Im having second thoughts. True the new Marvel adventure ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" features some joking byplay an elegantly superior villain a plot to wipe out humankind and several destroyed cities. But how many times have we seen this movie before? How many more times are we going to have to see it? Most of these characters are great fun and there are still stories to tell. So why not do it instead of telling and retelling the same tale only bigger? Another unstoppable energy source? Odin help us if they ever get around to tapping Tony Starks ego. This time around Hawkeye Captain America Iron Man Thor and the rest of the crew have finally recovered Lokis scepter. (You didnt know it was missing? You havent been paying attention.) But then Iron Man - or rather Stark - gets the idea of using it to power up his dream of an all-powerful protector with artificial intelligence. A creation which then in true creation-gone-wrong style - or maybe just classic ""Star Trek"" fashion - decides that the only really intelligent thing to do is rid earth of its inferior lifeforms. You know us. And being all-powerful whos going to stop him? Avengers assemble Its a tested formula - perhaps a little too tested - but there are still some interesting sideshows in it. Like a romance that blooms between the Hulk and Black Widow (despite some dodgy effects). Or the snide attitude guest villain James Spader gives the robotic Ultron. (Oh and a warning to you canonical Marvel fans out there - this Ultron story draws on a lot of different sources and does not include Hank Pym. So prepare your angry tweets now.) So its fun as far as it goes - but the same elements went a lot further the last time around. The film feels overstuffed - a mid-movie Hulk rampage amps up the destruction level without furthering the plot an effort to drag in minor characters feels forced. Besides this ""Avengers"" is already laden down with several extra characters including Vision Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch none of whom is well conceived. Quicksilver played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson this time around has boy-toy blonde highlights. Vision voiced by Paul Bettany has what looks like a metallic soul patch. And with her ripped stockings tiny skirt and flowing shawl Scarlet Witch looks like a first-year art major from a second-rate school. Really Elizabeth Olsen your sisters couldnt have given you some styling tips? Plus personally painful as it is for me to admit - he was my favorite character as a kid - Iron Man is starting to be a pain. We get that hes smart and sarcastic and rich but does he have to keep rubbing everyones shining face in it all the time? He never really accepts the consequences of his actions - remember Ultron is his idea and one he doesnt even run by the team - and when faced with his screwups he answers with a quip or smirk or putdown. Hes becoming Irony Man and he needs his own reboot right in his shiny butt. Not that this ""Avengers"" still isnt big and bright and shiny and fun. But so was the last one (which at least had some novelty) and so was the first ""Thor"" the first ""Captain America"" and some of the ""X-Men."" The model for a fun movie is there. But its getting time to move beyond the expected and explore some truly brave new worlds. Ratings note The film contains violence sexual innuendo and some mildly strong language. Avengers Age of Ultron (PG-13) Marvel/Disney (141 min.) Directed by Joss Whedon. With Robert Downey Jr. Mark Ruffalo Scarlett Johansson James Spader.

Wasnt he aiming for more? Andrew OHehir Follow Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Action movies avengers age of ultron Buffy the Vampire Slayer Disney Joss Whedon Marvel Marvel Comics Movies Stan Lee Summer movies superhero movies superheroes The Avengers Walt Disney Entertainment News (Credit Marvel) So Joss Whedon TV cult hero and creator of the Buffyverse has spent most of the last five years engaged in immensely lucrative struggle with a Marvel Comics mashup franchise. Toward what end I am genuinely not sure. I have tried to take the question seriously I went back and watched ""The Avengers"" again and now I have seen its sequel ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" also written and directed by Whedon. Its a high-spirited action-packed overly long adventure movie in which the all-star team of Marvel superheroes takes on a guy called Ultron. OK hes not a guy exactly; hes one of those ill-fated creations of human genius who redounds upon his creators after the fashion of Dr. Frankensteins monster and HAL 9000 and so on. Anyway Ultron is deliciously voiced by James Spader and like every pseudo-demonic villain in this kind of discount-store mythology he yearns to perfect the human race by exterminating it.Yeah weve been there and done that many times over. Such is the essential and insuperable problem of the 21st-century summer tentpole movie - for Hollywood purposes the first buds of May now count as ""summer"" - and such is the challenge Whedon has set himself. How much distinctive or idiosyncratic flavoring can an individual writer and director impart to a set of characters as well defined as this assemblage of Marvel superheroes and to a story that must progress from original sin to existential crisis to redemptive action climax with very little room for variation? There is honor to this quest and maybe even a kind of selflessness - if work whose craftsman is paid millions can ever be called selfless. Whedon is trying to meet the expectations of comic-book fans head on and satisfy them in full while proving to them and to us that these movies - the fundamental economic basis of the American film industry at this point -- dont have to be careless and juvenile and entirely bereft of psychological insight and adult emotion.This may be a perverse response but I enjoyed ""Age of Ultron"" more than its predecessor despite the fact that its almost exactly the same thing. This was probably a result of adjusting my expectations I wasnt sitting there waiting for Whedon to revolutionize the genre or to turn an overdetermined comic-book movie into a Noel Coward comedy. He delivers a clean and capable entertainment with a handful of distinctive flourishes stuck to the margins. Whedon does well with the darker edges of Robert Downey Jr.s Tony Stark (aka Iron Man) an arrogant tech genius whose degree of repentance for his war-criminal past is always ambiguous. He adds sparkling notes of screwball comedy and even tragedy to the incipient romance between Scarlett Johanssons Black Widow and Mark Ruffalos Dr. Bruce Banner (who like so many lovable men has a big green ugly side).Once we get to the supposedly climactic showdown with Ultron the movie is pretty boring; how many ways are there to threaten the planet with CGI destruction and then CGI-save it? Whedons complicated setup however offers intriguing hints of subtext. (I could write the same two sentences about almost any superhero movie.) Im never quite sure how to feel about Hydra the nemesis organization in the Marvel universe at least as it appears in Whedons movies. Of course Hydra is thoroughly despicable and all but its old-world pseudo-aristocratic Nazi steampunk vibe has a romantic allure totally absent from the sanitized corporate headquarters of the Avengers who are pretty much the secret police of the capitalist world order.When the Hydra-engineered mutant twins later to be known as Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch show up (played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen respectively) bearing a well-earned grudge against the Stark empire and the Western and/or American war machine I was on their side firmly and immediately. They are too awesome not to be coerced or compelled into switching to the Avenger team ultimately and while I understand why thats necessary in terms of future sequels and the coherence of Marvelology I wasnt happy about it. There is no third way in a comic-book universe no eccentric path that does not lead you to one or the other Manichaean pole. Resistance is literally futile.Whether or not Whedons extended Marvel career bypass was worth doing - how do we even begin to answer that? ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" will probably be the second-biggest Hollywood release of 2015 (after the J.J. Abrams ""Star Wars"" relaunch) so the answer provided by the Invisible Hand of the market would seem clear enough. But beyond the brutish fact of a worldwide billion-dollar gross or whatever it may be lie other facts more difficult to decode. As a cultural and commercial artifact ""Age of Ultron"" represents the way that Hollywoods role in the global economy has been altered or transformed. You could even say that its immense success or at least the specific character of that success tells us something about the diminished cultural role of cinema. You Might Also Like This is a gigantic movie by anyones definition. It cost something like 250 million to make and should deliver a handsome return on that investment. It has a passel of stars playing archetypal figures Downey in what may (or may not) be his final turn in the Iron Man suit Johansson and Ruffalo Chris Hemsworth as Thor Chris Evans as Captain America and Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye who gets a whole bunch of screen time that doesnt quite pay off. It will be the No. 1 box-office hit in virtually every country that has movie theaters and diplomatic relations with the United States. People in Iran and Yemen and Somalia and North Korea will watch pirated copies on the Internet if they possibly can.To some extent the presence of a well-respected and high-integrity auteur like Whedon mitigates the ambivalent atmosphere of calculation condescension and cynicism that surrounds so many nine-figure Hollywood productions. The ""Avengers"" franchise is more than a huge cash grab aimed at the collective Id of the worlds 17-to-24-year-old males. Its mythic; its ""ambitious."" No one involved needs to apologize to their artsy friends or to feel that the renovated hillside mansions and terraced swimming pools and BMW 6 Series convertibles of Los Angeles County were paid for with slightly dirty money the way they might after a Michael Bay movie.But this is a big movie whose cultural ripple effects are very small. Much of the anticipation for ""Age of Ultron"" is meta-anticipation - how big will the opening weekend be? - and I feel no coming groundswell of media thinkpieces or social-media debates or doctoral dissertations in embryo. I dont dispute that lots of people around the world will flock to see this movie and I imagine most of them will have fun. I had fun myself except for the whole thing about realizing that I was not-so-secretly rooting for Hydra and basically concluding that the Avengers are a fascist front group disguised by so many ideological switchbacks that we lose track of their core identity. No doubt there are circles where every detail of Whedons augmentation to the Marvel canon or his heretical departures therefrom will be earnestly discussed. But for most people there isnt that much to talk about after youve seen ""Age of Ultron"" except how cool it was and which jokes maybe fell a little flat and whether giving Renners character all that oxygen felt more like a dutiful setup for the next chapter than anything else. The text of the film if youll forgive the phrase - its story and its themes and its succession of scenes - is deliberately unsurprising and largely irrelevant. Were a long way from the kind of Zeitgeist-engorged Hollywood spectacle that appears to distill or refract a larger cultural moment the way that Tim Burtons 1989 ""Batman"" or Sam Raimis post-9/11 ""Spider-Man"" or Christopher Nolans first and second ""Dark Knight"" films did. This movie is fine honestly. I rather liked itEven Joss Whedon an undoubted pop-culture genius cannot create that kind of significance from whole cloth at least not after two dozen or more generally similar superhero movies have worn out the cultural resonance of the form. It would be foolish for me to sit here in a tweed jacket with leather patches on the elbows and proclaim that the era of the comic-book movie is coming to an end. Thats not happening anytime soon (and anyway I threw that jacket away). It might be accurate to say instead that superhero cinema has reached a decadent plateau a long-term steady state of self-nourishing bigness and reverberant meaninglessness. Whedon moves on from the Marvel empire not as its Augustus or its Spartacus but more like one of the later non-terrible Christian emperors who won some battles made some reforms and convinced everybody that the glory of Rome would endure forever. Was it worth doing? That depends on what you think of Rome. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

And for the most part this superhero extravaganza hits the bulls-eye with all the precision of Jeremy Renners arrow-slinging Hawkeye. PHOTOS Stars as superheroes Or put it this way You wont find any moments of introspection or wounded psyches here. Writer-director Joss Whedon knows that fans of this Marvel franchise crave the dessert buffet of colorful set pieces razor-sharp characters and a geekified inside jokes. So lets dig in. Once again the Avengers -- Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man) Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow) Mark Ruffalo (The Hulk) Chris Hemsworth (Thor) Chris Evans (Captain America) and Renner -- unite to save the world from global massacre. (When you assemble all that talent for a movie its of little use to have them running around to save cats in trees.) PHOTOS Celebs whove gained weight for film roles The impossibly convoluted story goes a little something like this Tony Stark (Downey) builds an artificial-intelligence machine dubbed Ultron (James Spader) in hopes of keeping ""peace in our time."" Dont let the snark fool you He means well he does But the robot goes rogue and develops a god complex. Forget helping mankind -- Ultron wants to make the Avengers extinct. It annihilates J.A.R.V.I.S. Starks other A.I. program and declares war. Then it creates its own synthetic creation named Vision (Paul Bettany also the voice of J.A.R.V.I.S. Confused yet?). Ultron also gets an assist from revenge-seeking twins Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) who have the powers of speed and creepy magic respectively. To quote Cobie Smulders Maria Hill ""Hes fast shes weird."" PHOTOS Scarletts sexiest moments As you might have surmised this plan entails an exorbitant amount of special effects-laden cartoon violence and destruction. Heck the gang chases down a few bad-bots before Ultron is a glimmer in Starks eye. Though the sequences pop on the screen visually they dont pop in terms of making a lasting impression. An indecipherable action scene in Asia for example seems shoehorned for the sole purpose of appealing to the overseas market. And the making-things-go-boom climax is a virtual copy of the 2012 ?original. Really. Take away those New York City skyscrapers and you wont know the difference. Avengers Age of Ultron cast Courtesy of Marvel 2015 The film flies higher when it stays grounded. As the superheroes take refuge in a safe house its a welcome relief to see them settle down and get their emotional bearings. A new character (played by Linda Cardellini) is introduced here and has an immediate payoff with one of the guys while an old friend turns up to deliver a much-needed verbal kick-in-the-butt. In even quieter scenes a genuinely heartfelt and sexy romance brews between Johansson and Ruffalo. PHOTOS Shirtless hunks The crowded cast is more of a necessary annoyance. Second installments by design are transitional -- i.e. an excuse to infuse newer and younger stars with the stalwarts. And this franchise in particular has unlimited growth potential. Face it 50-year-old Downey is not going to play Iron Man forever. (Not to alarm anyone but its been 28 years since he and Spader appeared together in Less Than Zero). So enjoy these original Avengers while we still have them. Boy do they have charm to spare. This cast sparkles together tossing off glib one-liners and ribbing each other like comedy vets. Watching each of them attempt to lift up Thors powerful hammer Mjolnir at a party is hampered only by the thought that the outtakes must be even more sublime. And surely no other spectacle this year will include a character bemoaning the high rent in Brooklyn. That kind of nimble chemistry cant be faked with CGI. Indeed if youre going to spend 141 minutes in a movie theater you might as well spend it with people you like. And that is what we want from our blockbusters right?

Director Joss Whedon (221). PG-13 Language violence. Area theaters. 3-D where available. Opens Thursday night. ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" is a kinetic wicked mix of muscle and magic. Look no further if you want a world of superpowered freaks and geeks. But be aware It comes at a cost. Vaporized in the parade of action and characters is the wonder and simplicity of its first superior entry. That terrific 2012 blockbuster fulfilled comic-book fans dream of seeing Marvels mightiest heroes on the big screen. This one assembles more seriousness and adds some fresh faces with fierce powers though the peril feels preprogrammed. EXCLUSIVE ROBERT DOWNEY JR. SURPRISES AUDIENCE PRIOR TO TEEN CHARITY SCREENING OF AVENGERS AGE OF ULTRON IN NEW YORK 1 photos view gallery Marvel unveils first look at The Avengers Age of Ultron The movie begins midbattle as the team invades a secret base where twins Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) and Pietro (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) are hiding. Their DNA has been rejiggered by villains so now hes Quicksilver and shes the telepathic Scarlet Witch. Or as someone notes ""Hes fast and shes weird."" The twins take a back seat as Tony ""Iron Man"" Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) uses Lokis scepter found at the base to rev up the A.I. program Stark built to protect Earth from evil aliens. But the ""Infinity Stone"" inside the scepter is uncontrollable and it creates Ultron (voiced by James Spader) a self-sustaining computer that builds itself a robot body. Ultron enlists Pietro and Wanda to help it delay the Avengers as it amasses a robot army and builds an ""ultimate synthetic being"" called the Vision (Paul Bettany). But after becoming sentient the Vision becomes good as do Pietro and Wanda. ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" (From l.) Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) Captain America (Chris Evans) Thor (Chris Hemsworth) Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) (Marvel) Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow. (Jay Maidment/Marvel) Chris Evans as Captain America. (Marvel) From l. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans). (Marvel) All three join Iron Man Captain America (Chris Evans) Thor (Chris Hemsworth) Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) to stop Ultron. AVENGERS AGE OF ULTRON ACTORS JEREMY RENNER CHRIS EVANS APOLOGIZE FOR CALLING BLACK WIDOW A SLUT Thats a lot of people and we havent even mentioned the cameos from Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) Rhodey ""War Machine"" Rhodes (Don Cheadle) and the Falcon (Anthony Mackie). Theres method in this madness though as director Joss Whedon involves us more in the group dynamics than in the ultimate showdown Hulk and Black Widow have an awkward dance of attraction Captain America and Iron Man verbally duel over the politics of preventative war and Hawkeye is revealed to have a cozy home life. 1 photos view gallery The Avengers Age of Ultron world premiere That entertaining give-and-take grounds the massive action scenes which have less logic this time round. (A giant chunk of land with an atomic bomb is elevated to destroy humanity. Nuff said.) It also gives its topnotch actors some chewy scenes especially Renner Ruffalo and Johansson. Of the newcomers Olsen is a sexy addition waving her arms around to conjure up mind-bending hexes while Bettany -- also crucially the voice of Starks computer butler J.A.R.V.I.S. -- projects a sinewy mystery in his few scenes. What keeps ""Age of Ultron"" from fully soaring is its villain and his sprawling strategy. Spaders lively vocal performance aside Ultron is an oddly limited creation and his robot buddies are echoes of the first films alien invaders. Seeing as this much-darker adventure lacks ""The Avengers "" colorful kid-like enthusiasm for good triumphing over evil Ultron needed a more substantial presence. Instead he blends into the background. But the drawbacks here are ultimately minimal. Even when ""Age of Ultron"" gets noisy or overbearing it feels like a house party everyone is at. Hey when nearly a dozen charm-machine superheroes converge on you at once youd have to be made of iron to deny their power. jneumaiernydailynews.com Catch ""Joe Neumaiers Movie Minute"" throughout the day Thurs. - Sun. on New Yorks WOR 710 AM and at wor710.com.

By Anthony Lane Ultron does battle with Iron Man in the new installment of the Avengers saga written and directed by Joss Whedon.   Credit Illustration by Brian Ewing Who is Ultron? What is he? I went into ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" not knowing whether the name referred to a man a concept or a laundry powder and I came out none the wiser. All I can tell you is that it speaks in the voice of James Spader and that it cant make up its humongous mind whether to save the world or to trash it. (This is a Marvel movie so the third option--simply leaving the world to get on with its daily business in its own sweet and shambling way--is not on the table.) To start with Ultron seems to be a computer program and at one point it even squares off against another computer program--a ball of sparky golden light versus a ball of sparky blue light bobbing and spitting at each other without a human in sight. Maybe one day all movies will look like that. As for our heroes last seen in ""The Avengers"" (2012) the same team takes the field pretty much unchanged and still lacking a really solid tight end. We have Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) Captain America (Chris Evans) Thor (Chris Hemsworth) Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and the guy with the bow and arrow (Jeremy Renner) whose name I can never remember. In a new and exciting bend in the plot one of them turns out to have a wife and kids which gives the gang a place to hole up and the wife a chance to say ""You know I totally support your Avenging."" Even cozier is a burgeoning affection between Black Widow and the Hulk--not someone you would choose to have a crush on you but thats love. In one deeply peculiar scene they both confess to being incapable of having children. ""I physically cant"" he claims. Probably a blessing. The story begins with a fight in a forest and ends with a fight in a city that floats in midair. In between there is a fight in a castle a fight on a freeway and a fight in the wake of a cocktail party. The loudest fight is a tussle between Iron Man and the Hulk which is part of a cunning scheme to rip the Avengers apart. Bring it on I say. It has something to do with dreams which are triggered by a blast of hypno-magic from the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) a new player in the game; each hero is disabled by harsh visions tailored to touch upon his or her worst fears. I vaguely hoped that Thor would find himself holding hands with Hello Kitty but no joy. The experience of watching ""Avengers Age of Ultron""--which is not just long but in Iron Mans words ""Eugene ONeill long""--runs as follows. First you try to understand what the hell is going on. Then you slowly realize that you will never understand what is going on. And last you wind up with the distinct impression that if there was anything to understand it wasnt worth the sweat. I gave up around the time that we were presented with something called the Mind Stone yet another cosmic thingamajig and apparently one of six ""infinity stones"" which sound like the kind of stuff that Bilbo Baggins would hawk on QVC. All of this is a bitter disappointment not least because the movie was written and directed by Joss Whedon. He is a smart and witty operator as was evident to anyone who saw ""Much Ado About Nothing"" the deft little jeu desprit that he knocked off in between this dose of Avenging and the last. Now and then in ""Age of Ultron"" amid the pap about ""molecular functionality"" we get glimpses of what Whedon can do as in the fine scene where Thors comrades attempt in turn to lift his mighty hammer. Could this be what it feels like to make a Marvel film as you strive to free up the dead weight of all that cod-mythology? On the night I saw the movie Whedon arrived to introduce it. ""Im really tired of it"" he said. Everyone laughed thinking that he was joking. Now Im not so sure. Do we need a new film of ""Far from the Madding Crowd""? Hardys novel was published in 1874 and was turned into a John Schlesinger movie with Julie Christie Terence Stamp and Alan Bates in 1967. Now it has emerged again with a script by David Nicholls who shaves the leisurely action to an hour less than Schlesinger required; Hardy fans will have a grand time grumbling at all the nips and trims. Some set pieces vanish entirely--the scene at the fair say in which Sergeant Troy the cad of the story who has gone missing shows up and dons a disguise. Schlesinger dwelled on this at lavish length so why doesnt his successor Thomas Vinterberg follow suit? Because I suspect he is addressing a new generation which knows neither the earlier film nor the book. He wants his twists to hang back and then to come out of nowhere like thunder. Carey Mulligan plays Bathsheba Everdene a country lass who inherits a farm in Wessex. She has three admirers but only one who adored her before her fortunes rose the shepherd Gabriel Oak (Matthias Schoenaerts) who remains as unfellable as his name suggests. Though she spurns his early proposal he stays by her side to help with the management of her estate. Then there is Boldwood (Michael Sheen) her moneyed neighbor and another rejected suitor. ""I have some interesting pigs"" he tells her as if that would boost his cause. How you prevent such a fellow crushed by his own decency from sagging into a bearded Ashley Wilkes is no easy task yet Sheen succeeds and Boldwoods brave smile grows dreadful to behold. ""I feel the most terrible grief"" he says when Bathsheba taking leave of her senses--or rather obeying them to the full--marries the mercurial Troy (Tom Sturridge). As Hardy puts it ""When a strong woman recklessly throws away her strength she is worse than a weak woman who has never had any strength to throw away."" And look what she throws it away on. Sturridges Troy Im afraid is a dumbfounding blend of waxwork and wimp and so often do his eyes mist over that I wondered whether his real problem was not the vagaries of lust but the Wessex pollen count. Why Bathsheba would give him the time of day let alone her body and soul is a mystery but the film toils hard to make us believe in that surrender. Hence the wonderful closeup after the first kiss with Troy of Bathshebas hands held out before her dangling as if desire had reduced this tough and resolute figure to a doll. Needless to say there is no right way to play her any more than there is a right way to play Cleopatra. Hardy gave his heroine a symphonic range and all an actress can do is pick out certain tones and strains--the fluted whimsy by which Bathsheba is occasionally stirred or the brassiness of her anger. Julie Christie was the more accomplished flirt and her beauty was composed of fire and air whereas Mulligan relies more darkly on earth and water. She hoes the clods of soil like a peasant in a Millet painting and plunges up to her waist to join Gabriel for the seasonal washing of sheep. In the light of that pluck Nicholls is right to uproot a vital sentence from the book and assign it to her practically intact ""It is difficult for a woman to define her feelings in language designed by men to express theirs."" Those words are so startlingly modern that to late-Victorian ears they must have verged on revolution. No wonder film directors keep coming back to Hardy who dares them as it were to match the acuteness of his noticing--Bathshebas ""black silk dress licking up a few straws and dragging them along with a scratching noise upon the floor."" Vinterberg who is less rhapsodic than Schlesinger and more inclined toward crisis homes in time and again on the exertions of muscle and heart. When Gabriel finds that his sheep have rushed uphill to a cliff top we track him as he hares after them desperation driving his great limbs. No less agonized is the scene in which he glances up from his scything sees Bathsheba pass proudly by in a horse and trap with Troy at her side and resumes his labors with added attack like the grimmest of possible reapers. Schoenaerts who is Belgian cant manage a proper West Country accent but then nor can anyone else in the film; the rustic group on whom Hardy depends as a tragicomic chorus becomes a mere backdrop. Yet Schoenaerts so formidable opposite Marion Cotillard in ""Rust and Bone"" (2012) continues to compel the eye. He is massive and passive yet swift to act when the harvest and thus the livelihoods of all concerned is menaced by storm and flame. Just as Schlesingers film screams 1967 (check out Christies hair) so Vinterbergs version will doubtless come to be viewed as a typical product of our time in both its haste and its recurrent gloom. Though its social scope is narrower than Hardys you do come away from it with a true sense of the shrouded world that he devised where fate could frown upon even the blithest day. That is why Bathsheba as she sets off to claim her inheritance is already clad in scarlet--the same dashing hue as Troys uniform. She hasnt met him yet but he awaits.

Avengers Age of Ultron Iron Man Thor and the Hulk finds fast new company in a Marvel hit that wont quit Avengers Age of Ultron Credit Marvel Disney By Peter Travers April 21 2015 More News From Avengers to X-Men A Brief History of Superhero Movies Top 40 Marvel Movie Ideas Ranked How the Return of Daredevil Darkens Marvels Universe Stan Lee on the Incredible Hulks Path to Age of Ultron All Stories >> Captain America actually says ""shit."" You heard me. ""Language"" scolds Iron Man who cant hide his glee at seeing the Cap a flag-wearing Greatest Generation war hero dent his tightass image. You wont have more fun anywhere than losing your shit at Avengers Age of Ultron. And you dont have to be a Marvel geek to get with the vibe. In this sequel to 2012s The Avengers which helped writer-director Joss Whedon achieve world box-office domination the movie swings for the fences going darker and deeper into the bruised psyches of this dysfunctional family of warriors. More News From Avengers to X-Men A Brief History of Superhero Movies Top 40 Marvel Movie Ideas Ranked How the Return of Daredevil Darkens Marvels Universe Stan Lee on the Incredible Hulks Path to Age of Ultron All Stories >> Related The Hulk Inside the New Issue Mark Ruffalo and Joss Whedon go deep on the Hulk and the Avengers sequel Dont get me wrong. Age of Ultron is a whole summer of fireworks packed into one movie. It doesnt just go to 11 it starts there. But its best when Whedon sins against the Hollywood commandment of playing it safe. He takes a few wrong turns creating a jumble when the action gets too thick. But he recovers like a pro devising a spectacle thats epic in every sense of the word. What do you need to know? That Tony Stark/Iron Man (quipmaster Robert Downey Jr.) has fucked up big-time. His peacekeeping program Ultron has become a robotic force of artificial intelligence (motion-captured and voiced with honey and malice by James Spader) intent on destroying every human on the planet. That cant happen so cue Team Avengers including Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Captain America (Chris Evans) for hammer-and-shield showmanship; Hulk (a superb Mark Ruffalo) for tempering rage with sexual healing from Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson); and best of all Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) for a startling backstory that Renner imbues with exhilarating humor and emotional heft. Related Secrets of Avengers Age of Ultron Joss Whedon Tells All Writer-director goes deep on the years most anticipated superhero blockbuster For added spice Whedon brings on the newbies. Theres the twins Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). Someone points out that ""hes fast and shes weird."" That aint the half of it. When Whedon and his FX team send the twins fictional Eastern European country into orbit youll see why. Still no one steals scenes from Ultron except the Vision an android played with touching gravity by Paul Bettany who previously voiced Iron Mans A.I. confidant J.A.R.V.I.S. and who reps the films moral conundrum. Wait what? Moral conundrum? What kind of escapism is this? IMO its the best kind the kind that sticks with you. Whedon is the true master of the Marvel Comic universe onscreen. He wont be back when Avengers Infinity War Part 1 and Part 2 start shooting next year. The Russo brothers will take the helm. That makes Age of Ultron Whedons last Avengers hurrah. And the monumental battle between gods and monsters that he stages to end the film does him proud. Bravo.

But with Marvels latest comic-book battle royale Avengers Age of Ultron I walked out of the theater feeling like the survivor of an all-you-can-eat buffet. There are five shock-and-awe action sequences when three would have sufficed. And there are more than a dozen main characters (including a few new ones) all jockeying for screen time when half that number would have already been pushing it. Even the films rimshot-ready one-liners have the overkill desperation of a stand-up scared of bombing. Either through his own ambition or the mandate of his corporate overlords writer-director Joss Whedon simply has too many balls to keep in the air for one movie--even a two-and-a-half-hour one--and you can feel his exhaustion. The movie wastes no time kicking off mid-battle as Robert Downey Jr.s Iron Man Chris Hemsworths Thor Chris Evans Captain America Jeremy Renners Hawkeye Scarlett Johanssons Black Widow and the CGI Hulk storm the medieval lair of the last remaining Hydra agent (Thomas Krestchmanns Baron Strucker) who possesses the glowing Staff of Loki and has nefarious plans for it. There they encounter a pair of new ""enhanced"" enemies the Russky-accented Maximoff twins Aaron Taylor-Johnsons blindingly fleet Quicksilver and Elizabeth Olsens telekinetic goth chick Scarlet Witch. Or as Cobie Smulders SHIELD agent succinctly describes them ""Hes fast and shes weird."" She might have also said ""Hes kinda boring and she looks like shed rather be at a Cure concert."" Either way theyre merely an amuse-bouche for the real baddie to come. Having recovered Lokis mystical doodad and its infinity-stone central processor Downeys Tony Stark decides to harness its energy to create an army of AI Iron Men to protect the planet from future threats. But his hubris backfires and he gives birth to the evil sentient robot Ultron whos bent on not only taking out the Avengers but the rest of humanity too. With his smarmy metallic croak Spader is perfectly cast as the voice of Ultron. So much so that its surprising its taken this long for someone to tap into the actors gift for threateningly bitchy condescension in one of these things. While the gang hopscotches across the globe finding new excuses to face off with Ultron Whedon does his best to occasionally slow the action down and give us the sort of character moments the film could have used more of. Fans of Mark Ruffalos Bruce Banner (for me the best surprise in the first Avengers) will appreciate his will-they-or-wont-they flirtation with Johanssons Black Widow. And theres a funny bit of cocktail-fueled macho bonding when each of the superheroes takes a stab at lifting Thors hammer (unsuccessfully). Even Renners Hawkeye whos always felt a bit like the sixth wheel of the bunch gets an unexpected backstory involving a secret family life with a wife (Linda Cardellini) and kids. Who knew that when he wasnt busy reaching into his quiver he was moonlighting as Alan Thicke from Growing Pains? Beyond the core spandex posse a slew of familiar faces wanders in and out of the picture as if someone back at Marvel HQ were desperate to extend the films line of action figures. Still my real beef with these movies--and this one in particular-- is how same-y theyve started to feel. Each time out everything is at stake and nothing is at stake. Someone wants to destroy the world but none of our heroes is ever in any jeopardy. With sequels already lined up for the next decade how much danger could any of them be in? Theyre too valuable to the bottom line. And wheres the excitement in that?

But then we come to the Avengers flicks partly for their clown-car excess of superheroes. What links Whedons comic-book spectacles with his Shakespeare are the quips. The original ""Avengers"" (2012) featured the rarest of superhero movie insults (""mewling quim"") and unfortunately there isnt room for much of Whedons dry wit in the massively overstuffed ""Age of Ultron."" While this installment could have amped up the brio it instead pushes further into complexity and emotions which make the meal high-cal but not particularly satisfying with only a bread-crumb trail of Whedon banter to help us find our way through the rubble.The action starts with the Avengers assembled for an assault on a remote HYDRA base in the fictional snowy vaguely Eastern European republic of Sokovia. Of course they include Robert Downey Jr.s Iron Man Chris Hemsworths Thor Mark Ruffalos Hulk Chris Evanss Captain America Scarlett Johanssons Black Widow and Jeremy Renners Hawkeye.Their powers are as varied (supernatural technological mythological lab experiments gone wrong) as their flaws (Iron Mans narcissism the Hulks rage the Black Widows regrets). Advertisement Downeys glib Tony Stark/Iron Man is the lead-singer equivalent of this super group and I suspect the one Whedon likes writing for most. (""Ive had a long day"" Stark says with a sigh ""Eugene ONeill long."") What ""Age of Ultron"" also has is a sense of fun which persists even when things go kablooey -- not always the case with other superhero films (yes Im scowling at you ""Man of Steel""). In Sokovia they encounter the duplicitous Quicksilver twins (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) who can with a crimson-colored magic read minds. These heavies however arent this films most formidable villain. Thats Ultron an artificial intelligence that the Scarlet Witch slyly leads Stark to create. It turns out not to be the global protection system he intended but a maniacal Frankenstein -- with some of its creators drollness thankfully.Ultron (James Spader) builds himself a muscular metallic body and begins amassing a robot army to rid the planet of human (and Avenger) life. Unfortunately Spaders portrayal is too similar to that of other mechanical monsters to equal or surpass Tom Hiddlestons great Loki the nemesis in the previous ""Avengers"" film. But Spaders jocular menace is a plus as he wickedly hums Pinocchio tunes like ""There are no strings on me."" The drama in this film lies only partly in the battle against Ultron which skips around the globe (Seoul South Africa) as the combatants acquire rare metals and a tissue-generating invention.Another main theme is the fraying functionality of the Avengers themselves and the existential quandaries they face since they remain proficient killers but are now untethered from the S.H.I.E.L.D. agency which has been dismantled.The films most successful moments perhaps come in the tender scenes between Ruffalos Bruce Banner/Hulk and Johanssons former Russian spy who soothes the Hunks enraged ""big guy"" with her soft voice petting his hand until he shrinks back to Banner.There are no wrong notes from this cast. Just about any film with the likes of Spader Ruffalo Johansson Hemsworth and Downey is certain to entertain. But this films attention to the vulnerability of the Avengers makes the pace drag at times. And the story arcs of its many characters -- Avengers bad guys new characters -- are simply too much for even a master juggler like Whedon to keep aloft.Paul Bettany (previously the voice of Iron Mans computer J.A.R.V.I.S.) is a late arrival to the party playing Vision a preternaturally poised floating hero who resembles a red Powder.The movies action sequences and sequel-baiting suck up much of its oxygen and the magnitude of battles dwarf the smaller moments. We savor watching the Avengers just sitting around musing about how the laws of physics affect Thors heavy hammer.As this Marvel juggernaut rolls relentlessly forward (the next movies are slated for 2018 and 2019) ""Age of Ultron"" feels like a story that tries its best to stay light on its feet but gets dragged down by the weight of The Franchise. Avengers Age of Ultron   1/2Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi action violence and destruction and for some suggestive commentsCast Robert Downey Jr. Chris Hemsworth Mark Ruffalo Chris Evans Scarlett Johansson Jeremy Renner James Spader Paul Bettany Aaron Taylor-Johnson Elizabeth OlsenWriter-director Josh WhedonRunning time 2 hours 30 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

Entertainment The Best Thing About ""Avengers Age Of Ultron"" Is The Humanity Marvels latest is its biggest baddest installment yet but its the little moments that make it work -- in part because Joss Whedon is so good at them. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Chris Hemsworth Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans in Avengers Age Of Ultron. Jay Maidment / Marvel Studios ID 5552163 Of all the big developments and plot twists preloaded into Joss Whedons Avengers Age of Ultron the best surprise which I wont spoil involves a glimpse of a characters home life.Its a surprise because of what it contains but also because it seems fair to say you dont come to an Avengers movie expecting much by way of home lives. Theyre designated special occasion affairs -- grander more star-packed and more blow-uppy than the regular Marvel Cinematic Universe installments which are already pretty action-packed.Domesticity and downtime arent the kinds of things a tentpole extravaganza typically squanders too many minutes on not when theres a robot army to battle humanity to save and groundwork for future installments to be laid. And Avengers Age of Ultron which opens in U.S. theaters on May 1 has a lot of (a little too much) business to attend to beyond that including the introduction of some new superheroes -- twins Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) and Pietro (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) Maximoff aka the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver along with the Vision (Paul Bettany) who doesnt arrive so much as form. View this image > Marvel Studios ID 5554316 Avengers Age of Ultron is bigger messier and more sprawling than The Avengers less satisfying while still being an undeniably good time from the opening raid on a Hydra stronghold to the concussive finish. But this film more than the first is also beset by tension between the need for blustery set pieces and the fact that the greatest pleasure of these movies is actually watching its varied and not always simpatico superheroes hang out and interact especially as written by someone with such a feel for them as distinctive personalities.Avengers Age of Ultron which Whedon wrote and directed literally reaches for the sky in one of its later action sequences which one-ups the many recent blockbusters that have ended with mere buildings getting flung around. But its that interlude at the house that goofy party scene and those bits of banter in between body blows that stand out and that are the greatest thing Whedon has brought to the Marvel Cinematic Universe in his tenure with it as a writer director and creative adviser.Its fun to see these characters fight together and sometimes against each other. But its so much better to see them talk and to revel in the facets of their fully formed personalities and personal histories underneath their outsize exteriors. Avengers Age of Ultron continues Whedons tradition of treating these characters like people who happen to be capable of extraordinary things. Its not the grandeur of Avengers Age of Ultron that makes it good. Its the bits of wry or vulnerable humanity -- even when the characters in question arent technically human. View this image > Marvel Studios ID 5554325 One of those characters is the baddie of Avengers Age of Ultrons title an artificial intelligence that Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) builds without consulting his teammates. Creating technology to stop wars before they start is part of Starks plan to achieve ""peace in our time"" but Ultron whos made with the help of some confiscated Hydra research immediately comes up with his own interpretation of Starks mandate that involves taking out the Avengers and then possibly the rest of humanity.Ultrons motivations are garbled even when he finally gets around to explaining then but hes voiced by James Spader with a wonderfully unrobotic bitchiness (""I cant physically throw up in my mouth"" he snarks at one point). After making a dramatic entrance in a half-assembled Iron Man suit Ultron turns out to be an unmemorable villain physically -- hes a bunch of identical robots and one slightly more distinguished one -- but hes prone to bursts of rage and philosophy. Hes Starks finest and darkest impulses siphoned out and made whole the apocalyptic AI version of a rebellious son.And even with the introduction of the twins who start off as Hydra and then Ultrons allies Stark remains the most morally complex figure around wrestling with PTSD thats crystallized by one of Wandas mind-control visions willing to charge ahead with his ideas without oversight or wider discussion. ""We dont have time for a city hall debate"" he tells Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo). View this image > Marvel Studios ID 5554352 Starks not a good team player in part because he admits what hed like to do is figure out a way to make the team unnecessary by figuring out a way of protecting humanity permanently and perfectly a ""suit of armor around the world."" Stark gets many of the Avengers Age of Ultrons best quips (though Jeremy Renners Clint Barton actually walks off with the lions share this time around) but hes also its least trustworthy character the one who seems most likely to accidentally eradicate humanity with all of the best intentions at heart.The MCU will sorely miss Downey Jr. when he eventually leaves Iron Man behind. He oozes the ethical unease these movies need. Stark is a witty conflicted superheroic embodiment of imperfect tech utopianism tied to capitalist guilt for a past he can never leave behind a character who always hints at real-world relevance without it needing to be explicit. When one of his remote-controlled Iron Legion lands in the fictional Eastern European country of Sokovia where the film begins the crowds its supposed to help hiss and throw things while on the wall behind it Iron Man stencils are overlaid with dollar-sign graffiti.None of the new characters Avengers Age of Ultron trots out suggest theyll make the same eventual kind of impact at least so far despite the caliber of actors playing them. Olsens Scarlet Witch is the toughest fit always seeming a little sillier than intended when summoning her powers with liquid dancing-style hand motions. With humanity comes time passing and among other things Avengers Age of Ultron provides a bittersweet reminder of the extent to which the Marvel movie empire is greater than any cast member or creative voice. View this image > Marvel Studios ID 5554377 But the old class isnt headed anywhere yet and Avengers Age of Ultron is threaded through with a particularly nice romance involving two of them -- Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and Banner. Theyre two characters with baroque personal histories but their flirtations are tentative and earnest falling between Beauty and the Beast and ""popular girl falls for charming geek."" Watching them together its easy to appreciate their battlefield feats in which the Hulk gallantly smashes a gun turret for the Black Widow. But its their other interactions that you long to see more of. What would their home life be like? 6. Joss Whedons Astonishing Spine-Tingling Soul-Crushing Marvel Adventure buzzfeed.com ID 5554659 8.

In the previous movie Joss Whedon spent much of the dazzling running time building up to this moment so when the team finally assembled it felt like the triumphant outcome of an epic gamble -- both commercially and artistically the movie did its job. By contrast ""Age of Ultron"" plays out like a spectacular shrug Weve already arrived at the destination before the journey begins. With comics vet Whedon once again holding the reigns as writer-director ""Age of Ultron"" still manages to deliver an impressive scale and the ability to translate its colorful majestic figures into cinematic form. From Iron Mans speedy aerodynamics to the Hulks path of destruction the characters move through the murky plot with tremendous versatility. But Whedon comes up short with the challenge of crafting genuine excitement over the latest perils facing the same people weve watched save humanity several times before. The previous movie had the rare quality of a mass market spectacle driven by witty banter as much as the stunning effects work. The new one offers a handful of intriguing developments but lacks the same dynamic chemistry that made the initial installment such an anomaly. Whereas ""The Avengers"" felt like a reimagining of the paradigm for superhero movies ""Age of Ultron"" has air of a rerun. Though impressively made and visually remarkable it suffers from the hollowness that plagues so many blockbusters carrying the sense that weve been through this before. At the end of ""The Avengers"" Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) manages to stop an alien invasion in New York. This time he inadvertently sets the stage for a variation on the same threat by initiating a ""peacekeeping"" software program named Ultron that transforms into a power-hungry form of artificial intelligence intent on killing the entire Avengers crew. That straightforward scenario doesnt take long to take shape but for the rest of the movie the Avengers gradually deal with cleaning up the mess -- and essentially go through the same motions weve seen them endure before. Fortunately Whedon has done justice to the nefarious cybernetic villain whose comic book reign goes back several decades. Appropriately voiced by James Spader who gives the impression of icy calculation with every line the robotic Ultron looks like the Terminator on steroids and comes equipped with a much savvier mind. But Ultron doesnt work in a vacuum. His scheme is empowered by twin villains Pietro and Wanda Maximoff aka Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch (Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen) who harbor a grudge against Stark Industries for developing the bombs that destroyed their family in an earlier war. The supernaturally empowered duo trick Stark into getting ahold of Lokis scepter which ends up endowing Ultron with his evil proclivities. At the same time Stark receives much of the blame for creating the menacing figure in the first place. The self-interests at the root of this conundrum lend a darker thematic focus than most Marvel movies. However once Ultron comes to life and begins threatening humanity ""Age of Ultron"" starts to drag. ""How does humanity save itself it it doesnt evolve?"" Ultron says aloud to nobody in particular as he envisions a new age of robotic rule. After sitting through a series of unremarkable developments its hard not to relate to his sentiment. To be fair ""Age of Ultron"" offers a handful of sharply scripted moments that deepen its heroes motives. Theres some promise to the idea of the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) crushing hard on Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) and attempting to help him cope with his tendency to transform into a monstrous green muscleman but the subplot drifts in and out of the proceedings like a half-formed seed planted in the service of future installments in the franchise. Other characters such as Samuel L. Jacksons one-eyed S.H.I.E.L.D overlord Nick Fury or Don Cheadles Iron Man sidekick War Machine surface in bit parts just to remind us of the bigger picture. But at this point its gotten so crowded that the franchise could burst at any moment. By its climax thats exactly what it does. Yet another CGI extravaganza in which the third act involves a menacing fiery object speeding down to terra firma ""Age of Ultron"" lacks any semblance of an attempt to surprise audiences -- even though each pricey digitally-enhanced shot manages to enthrall in the moment. It looks great moves fast and intimates anyone willing to question the fancy gadgetry in play. And so does Chris Hemsworth charming as ever in the mock-brutish role of Thor who has become synonymous with these movies ability to feel both stilted and amusing at the same time. But the true symbolic weight lies with Chris Evans much blander Captain America whose presence epitomizes the larger agenda on display -- to sweep us up in the unabashed rush of the mission at hand and stop questioning its purpose. ""You know I totally support your avenging"" says one civilian onlooker. He speaks for the masses. However ""Age of Ultron"" provides an excuse for a reality check. Whedons script frequently repeats Ultrons eerie verdict that mankind is doomed which means that the Avengers are fated to salvage it indefinitely. Thats a scarier concept than anything the robotic evildoer dreams up. Above all else the latest ""Avengers"" proves that even a great franchise has an expiration date.

The first avengers had enemies that were an ALIEN RACE led by an Asgardian. Absolutely ZERO to do with Iron Man. Get it straight man - then come back to the table when you have something to offer. Reply TK May 12 2016 656 pm Why? They were in Wakanda showed the Vibranium wrecked the area and Black Panther doesnt make an appearance? No honorable mention? Im done. Decent flick though. But I can guarantee if the Hulk rampaged Gotham City Batman would show up. (I know DC and Marvel worlds dont cross on movies. Just making a point) Reply Joe May 12 2016 656 pm Your headline sums up almost every Marvel movie for the last 10 years. They found something that sells so theyll keep beating the dead horse until it stops bleeding cash. Reply Edward Saluem May 12 2016 656 pm I keep seeing douche bags say if fanboys got laid or if they werent nerds they wouldnt like the avengers movies so much. Well in dating the porn star vanadisstarr and I love the avengers movies comics and collectibles plus i fxck a porn star. Reply popperdoom May 12 2016 656 pm Thanks for spoiling the plotline to everyone Reply ET May 12 2016 656 pm That ""avenging"" quote at the end there is taken totally out of context. For a start its a She not a He and for another its hardly a civilian onlooker give which character actually says it... Reply Mike May 12 2016 656 pm I dont think you know how sequels work. The whole point is that they are a team and working together. Why would they build up to this moment in the 2nd film?...it already happened. And why are you asking ""havent we been here before?"" if you want this to be structured like the first Avengers? Just that they are revealed to be together as a team at the beginning is already different. Reply Laura May 12 2016 656 pm Not one mention of Hawkeye or Jeremy Renner. Same goes for Vision. Did you even see the movie? Reply cil May 12 2016 656 pm Well. Speak for yourself. I am waiting Avengers 3 Reply Joe May 12 2016 656 pm This article is written by a brainless idiot who watched two minutes of the movie and made up his mind that he should wet his pants. Reply Forever May 12 2016 656 pm Try to relax and enjoy things rather than trying to find reasons not to. Youll be much happier and people will hate you less. Reply NATE May 12 2016 656 pm I always get tickled when I see/read these type of reviews because they help to support EXACTLY what ""JR"" said about making a ton of money - the movie WILL regardless of what the critics say. This critic just GUARANTEED some even BIGGER numbers at the box office. Movie goers are creatures of habit who will stand their ground whenever critics ""attack"" something they love. Congrats you just helped send them to their 2ND Billion Dollar run lol Reply Neomotion May 12 2016 656 pm The ""I support all your avenging"" line comes from the wife of Hawkeye... Reply CRIS May 12 2016 656 pm Greg - those arent really spoilers ;) you already know whats going to happen -- maybe not the details as to how many bad guys get bloodied or how many jokes gets cracked or which city gets the shit kicked out of it but the formula is writ large and never changing. Ill pass even if it was free and save myself the 2 1/2 hours -- and Im a longtime JW fan. (Best hero-type movie these days is the 13 hour-long one playing on Netflix DAREDEVIL). Reply diana May 12 2016 656 pm Another CGI laden brutal movie with no soul only a lame story for the glory of money. Reply Josh May 12 2016 656 pm I think YA franchises are a bigger drain on society than the Avengers. Reply S May 12 2016 656 pm Just think how different how all these fanboys and their movies would be if they actually got laid for the first time in their lives Reply skywater May 12 2016 656 pm LMAO Butthurt fanbois voicing their disapproval for a review that dares to be anything less than raving for an avengers movie. Reply Peter May 12 2016 656 pm Dont write reviews its not for you... Reply Skywater May 12 2016 656 pm C+???? Are you people trying to start a riot?? Reply CheckYourself May 12 2016 656 pm What we really dont need are articles about blockbuster studio films on ""independent"" film websites Reply michael May 12 2016 656 pm this review is proof that we dont need movie criticsgt; This looks bad (review) but havent we been here before? Reply Dante DAnthony May 12 2016 656 pm Our Indie project has a couple of years pre-development...but if we were to share the link...on an Indie Wire article we would be ""spammy""...? (pandoran age dot com) Reply Dante DAnthony May 12 2016 656 pm More Indies Reply JML May 12 2016 656 pm I think now were being spoiled by good comic book movies...Our past selves would kill to see great movies like this over Batman and Robin and Batman Forever...This movie looks amazing and yea its hard to top the first one but dont act like the first one is completely original either...Phantom Menace was the first to show if you kill off the space station you kill all the enemies everywhere and the threat instantly goes away...Also the Nuke thing has been done with The Dark Knight Rises and Independence Day...Im still pumped to see this movie because Im all for a good time at the movies... Reply Ryan May 12 2016 656 pm Just my opinion here but being a fan of the source material that these movies are based off of in itself makes me like these movies. Yes I may complain at times that a character was cast badly or a certain storyline that should have been followed wasnt followed but all in all I enjoy these films more than most any other films. That being said and once again this is just my opinion but if you are not a fan of the things these movies are based on (comics in this case) then in all honesty your opinion of the film and whether you liked it or not are pretty much irrelevant. Reply Pj May 12 2016 656 pm Tip of the cap for not giving crap a pass just because its going to make money. Reply T May 12 2016 656 pm this movie will make millions. Your reviews are irrelevant. Reply Jaine May 12 2016 656 pm I love that INDIEwire is reviewing one of the biggest studio films of the year. Way to sell out on your mission statement. Reply BongSauce May 12 2016 656 pm So A C+ rating is considered bad on rotten tomatoes? Reply Patrick Rodrigues May 12 2016 656 pm ""Above all else the latest ""Avengers"" proves that even a great franchise has an expiration date."" A Marvel studio head nods his head in agreement as he sits in his office. ""You know this Eric Kohn guy had a point; the franchise is now expired. Everybody Throw out all our plans for the future Marvel movies Eric Kohn has declared that our franchise has expired"" Reply Kevin May 12 2016 656 pm IndieWire writer dislikes mainstream film for nebulous reasons. Stop the presses everyone. Reply Thomas May 12 2016 656 pm Yeah weve been here every month for the past 40 years WTF is weong with you? You have to butch about something I say Kill the Lawyers right after the critics youre all no good. Reply Jeff May 12 2016 656 pm It is a sequel. By definition we have been here ONCE before. Sounds like pseudo intellectual nonsense to me. Reply Henry May 12 2016 656 pm Tru Not that he wins but the Joker doesnt lose in The Dark Knight. But point taken. I think with these new megafranchises and slates its pretty clear whats going to happen the moment they are announced. Reply tru May 12 2016 656 pm Greg its not like you dont know how almost every superhero film is going to end. The bad guy always loses. Reply DoubleD May 12 2016 656 pm I for one am getting exhausted by the endless carbon copies of Ironman in these movies. I do feel liek we have seen this before. How about a new villain something more organic not just another Transformer/Iron Man robot Reply Michael Willer May 12 2016 656 pm ""Chris Pine""... Really? Reply JR May 12 2016 656 pm Itll still make a ton of money. And beget even more films like it in exclusion to anything else with an ounce of soul. Reply Greg May 12 2016 656 pm SPOLIER ALERT.

In the first ""Avengers"" writer-director Joss Whedon showed a facility for bringing modern comic books to the screen with equal parts snappy banter and awe-inspiring mayhem and while those gifts remain evident in ""Ultron"" you can feel the functionality of Disneys Marvel movies overwhelming the fun. This latest film isnt a cheat but neither is it a delight. Also Read Hulk Battles Hulkbuster in New Avengers Age of Ultron Clip (Video) ""Ultron"" begins with the action already in progress with Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) Captain America (Chris Evans) Thor (Chris Hemsworth) the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) storming the castle of Baron Strucker (Thomas Krestchmann) the last uncaptured agent of Hydra. Strucker possesses the Staff of Loki which contains a jewel that drives the plot in various directions particularly when Stark realizes that theres an intelligence within the stone that could provide AI for an army of robotic Iron Men to keep Earth safe from outside invaders. Stark is swiftly punished for his hubris when that artificial intelligence becomes Ultron (voiced by James Spader) who infiltrates the worlds computers and begins assembling his own mechanical army to erase humanity and allow the planet to start over without us. Aiding Ultron are two former lieutenants of Struckers twins Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) and Pietro Maximoff (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) whose powers (as Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver) are succinctly summed up by SHIELDs Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) ""Hes fast and shes weird."" (Hill is too tactful to point out that their powers do not include successfully grappling with an Eastern European moose-and-squirrel accent.) There are moments of respite between the big battles and thats when Whedon can give us his trademark badinage. What he does less successfully is fit in quotidian moments with Black Widow Hulk and Hawkeye the characters who havent had movies named after them over the last three years. Add some crammed-in cameos from the sidekicks from ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" ""Thor The Lost World"" and ""Iron Man 3"" and the film starts to resemble a phone booth crammed with frat pledges. Also Read MTV Movie Awards Robert Downey Jr. Accepts Generation Award from Avengers Co-Stars (Anyone not present and accounted for -- Gwyneth Paltrow and Natalie Portman had other engagements apparently -- is at least mentioned in dialogue.) All these minor characters and blueprints for their function in the coming chapters give ""Ultron"" a bloat that the prior film didnt have and while the movie jumps through enough hoops to remain entertaining on a basic level it doesnt have the giddy enjoyment factor of ""Avengers"" and ""The Dark World"" nor the smarts and character development of ""The Winter Soldier."" Marvel movie die-hards will come away having found nuggets of pleasure but those who complain about superhero sagas will find plenty to support their arguments here. Also Read Avengers Sequel Tracking to Beat Originals Record Opening With 200 Million-Plus The ensemble cast (which also includes Don Cheadle Stellan Skarsgard Linda Cardellini and of course Samuel L. Jackson) knows exactly what they need to do and delivers it with a minimum of fuss; the scene-stealer of the bunch turns out to be Spader who makes Ultron one of the screens drollest destroyers of worlds. Ultron is menacing but never unmotivated and Spader knows just how to give Whedons dialogue the right lilt to make it both witty and terrifying. It may well be that well eventually stop looking at these Marvel films as discrete individual experiences rather than chapters in an epic binge-watch but even by those standards ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" feels like a solid but overstuffed episode one more concerned with being connective tissue than anything else. Future Marvel-movie marathoners will find plenty of sandwich-grabbing opportunities during its running time. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Daily Edition Login to download Avengers Age of Ultron Film Review 200 PM PDT 4/21/2015 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS The box-office superheroes return a bit less powerfully TWITTER Joss Whedon tries to top 2012s The Avengers with the new installment which finds the all-star Marvel superheroes dispatching the remnants of the nasty HYDRA organization. The powers of Marvels all-star superheroes go a bit wobbly in Avengers Age of Ultron. Faced with the daunting prospect of topping the surprise and excitement of 2012s The Avengers the third-highest-grossing film of all time writer-director Joss Whedon mixes some brooding down time in with the abundant spectacle. To be sure series junkies will get their fix from the sheer massiveness of the exploits but at least two of the big action scenes are lackluster while the climax and resolution could have been worked out in more complex less rote ways so as to further increase intrigue and anticipation for Avengers Infinity War parts one and two already scheduled for release in May of 2018 and 2019 respectively. Not that any of this will matter much since the pent-up excitement among the enormous international fan base is so intense that nothing will keep the summers presumed biggest franchise blockbuster from soaring beyond the 1 billion threshold internationally. Hands-on producer Kevin Feige and his associates have built a cinematic empire quite unprecedented in Hollywood history a veritable solar system of staggeringly profitable individual franchises unified by the overpowering collective force of the Avengers. So while sideline enterprises like the new Daredevil TV series continue to pop up the companys confidence in the enduring appeal of its theatrical mainstays is such that it recently published a release schedule for its remaining big-gun commercial titles from now through the end of the decade. At this point no one would be willing to bet on when and whether a sense of terminal deja vu might set in to bring it all to an end. Read more Why Fans Arent Thrilled With Batman v. Superman Footage So Far In the meantime the key points of interest surround how many surprises and twists can be wrung from a format that due to core-fan expectations demands great fealty; any significant deviations from the source material are taken as personal betrayals by the hardest-core geeks. Last summer Guardians of the Galaxy showed that Marvel could play it a bit more fast and loose than it generally does but the big-name franchises still seem sacrosanct. And so it is with Avengers Age of Ultron which at moments takes a peek down some shadowy side roads but ends up mostly zooming along the main highway to deliver what the audience wants rather than something even a little bit different. Picking up where last years Captain America Winter Soldier left off the new film without preamble dives right in to show the Avengers dispatching the remnants of the nasty HYDRA organization in a hectically and indifferently staged forest combat scene that leaves Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) worse for wear while also introducing two new adversaries twins Pietro and Wanda Maximoff (Aaron-Taylor Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen) aka Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. Victory allows for some passably amusing scenes of the heroes blowing off steam The favorite party trick of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is to challenge all comers to lift up his hammer; Natasha/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) pursue a little mating dance in which her amorous interest is predicated upon his retaining his human rather than superhero form; and Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) take stock of the advances their old Nazi nemesis Strucker (Thomas Kretschmann) appears to be making in the artificial intelligence department specifically with the most sophisticated humanoid ever devised Ultron (voiced with marvelous robotic nuance by James Spader). Ultron is a cool and sophisticated creation; what he lacks of course is a heart which is what makes him such an imposing villain. A sleekly designed robot you might even call handsome he makes an excellent intellectual and smart-ass sparring partner for Stark but when he first appears hes still on training wheels. However he does recruit the Maximoffs to his cause an easy matter since Stark killed their parents. Ultron is not yet entirely ready to conquer the universe but in their first skirmish with him the Avengers are outclassed enough to begin worrying. Licking their wounds at the ""safe house"" of Hawkeyes farm the Avengers go into a funk. The impatient Thor quickly takes off ""to find answers"" Bruce resists Natashas desire to get something physical cooking between them; Stark lamenting that ""Ultron is tryng to tear us apart"" consults with old cohort Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson briefly) while Mad Mens Linda Cardellini playing Hawkeyes stand-by-your-man wife is stuck with the (intentionally?) funniest line of dialogue in the film ""You know I totally support your avenging."" While some of his partners wallow in disarray Captain America heads for Seoul where the next evolutionary step is to emerge via a device called ""the Cradle"" which will hatch mass-produced android soldiers that will pave the way for Ultrons world domination. But a major chase through the city involving a runaway subway train falls flat due to basic conceptual silliness and poor continuity. Of course the Avengers ultimately get it together to do the kind of butt-kicking theyre supposed to do and a very welcome addition to the team comes in the form of the android Vision. Red-faced and green-garbed Vision is given a striking profile and overall presence by Paul Bettany (heretofore limited in the Marvel world to vocal work as Starks computerized butler JARVIS) and it can be hoped if not assumed that this most intriguing character will play an even more important role in the final two Avengers installments. Ultimately Whedons efforts to invest the heroes with a degree of unsurety and vulnerability comes off as half-baked as such an effort can only go so far due to the nature of the material. After all these are comic book characters defined by their double identities; a third dimension is neither required nor perhaps even desired. Read more Marvels Secret Wars What Newcomers Need to Know If ending on a dramatic cliffhanger note had been desired the elements were there for the taking; including a semi-tragic component along with uncertainty about Ultrons ultimate fate would arguably have only further cranked up anticipation for the coming chapters. But then what does that matter when the automatic attendance of millions is assured? Avengers Age of Ultron succeeds in the top priority of introducing a worthy opponent for its superheroes and giving the latter a few new things to do but this time the action scenes dont always measure up and some of the characters are left in a kind of dramatic no mans land. The returning series actors acquit themselves in the expected agreeable manner while series newcomer Andy Serkis has a terrific couple of minutes as a tough but stressed South African criminal.

Age of Ultron though has a definite mid-season feel to it telling a compelling but never game-changing story while laying the foundations for the epic two-part Infinity War due in 2018. It may be piled with MacGuffins magic crystals red-skinned demi-Gods and psychic asides but at the heart of Ultron is a simple even derivative plot about overweening ambition and technology run amok. When Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) combine to create the worlds first fully functioning AI they dont stop to think of the consequences. And of course its not long before Ultron (voiced by James Spader) is building an army of robots bent on wiping out the population of earth - starting with the noble Avengers. Whedon has revealed that his first cut ran for well over three hours and it shows Ultron feels excessively nipped and tucked barrelling from one explosive set-piece to the next leaving ideas half-formed and character motivations murky. While the introduction of new superheroes like Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and the confusingly multi-talented Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) may excite comic fans it makes for such a crowded field that even star players like Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Captain America (Chris Evans) are shoved to the sidelines. Age of Ultron is still a Joss Whedon film packed with all the pathos snappy action sequences and pomposity-puncturing one-liners we expect (a running gag about Thors hammer is almost worth the ticket price alone). But with Marvels eyes on the ultimate prize is their long game threatening to short change viewers and constrain fiercely independent filmmmakers like Whedon?

Three years after saving New York from an alien apocalypse Marvels superhero all-stars once again find the weight of the world -- or at least an airborne chunk of Eastern Europe -- thrust upon their mighty shoulders in ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" a super-sized spandex soap opera thats heavy on catastrophic action but surprisingly light on its feet and rich in the human-scale emotion that can cut even a raging Hulk down to size. Having gotten over the hump of assembling his six main characters in 2012s ""The Avengers"" returning writer-director Joss Whedon brings a looser more inventive and stylish touch to this skillful follow-up which finds our now S.H.I.E.L.D.-less defenders facing off against a man-made enemy more dangerous than any alien life form. Jump-starting the summer movie season on May 1 ""Age"" may well cool its heels in theaters until the dog days of August where it stands a very good shot at surpassing the previous films 1.5 billion worldwide haul. For all its box office muscle (making it the third-highest domestic and global grosser of all time behind ""Avatar"" and ""Titanic"") ""The Avengers"" was hardly the most glittering gem in the Marvel Cinematic Universe arguably more memorable for its snappy banter between caped crusaders than for its two gargantuan pummeling action setpieces (one on a state-of-the-art aircraft carrier the other on the streets of Manhattan) which seemed haphazardly stitched together by Whedon and his editors as if they were being paid by the cut. That movie largely lacked the more intimate character-building moments that had distinguished the first ""Iron Man"" and ""Captain America"" adventures from the superhero herd. But it did have two aces up its vibranium sleeve in the form of Tom Hiddlestons fratricidal Loki (sinking his teeth into each of Whedons faux-Shakespearean lines as though they were ripe juicy plums) and Mark Ruffalos existentially conflicted Dr. Bruce Banner/Hulk ill at ease in his own body whether green or white. Having apparently resolved that one failed Earthly invasion is enough for one millennium Loki is nowhere to be found in ""Age of Ultron"" but even minus his caustic wit the new movie is a sleeker faster funnier piece of work -- the sort of sequel (like ""Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan"" ""Superman II"" and ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" before it) that shrugs off the self-seriousness of its predecessor and fully embraces its inner Saturday-morning serial. Rather than putting all his eggs in one apocalyptic basket Whedon this time hopscotches the globe from Europe to Africa to Asia and back staging exuberant mini-cliffhangers as he goes. And if we must once again watch the world end -- or come perilously close -- ""Age of Ultron"" at least gives us a more compelling (and plausible) destroyer than yet another galactic supervillain hellbent on domination. Specifically it gives us that most destructive of all universal forces mans own best intentions. Before all that this second chapter plunks us down in the wintry republic of Sokovia where Captain America (Chris Evans) and the gang raid a mountaintop Hydra base to retrieve Lokis troublesome scepter from the clutches of Baron Wolfgang von Strucker (Thomas Kretschmann last seen up to no good in the post-credits teaser from last years ""Captain America The Winter Soldier""). Its there that the team first encounters two new genetically enhanced foes the twins Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) he of blinding speed and she of blazing psychic powers -- including the ability to infect others with vivid and terrifying waking dreams rooted in their deepest fears. These nifty phantasmagorias allow Whedon to flex his visual imagination in ways that the first ""Avengers"" never hinted at (think ""A Nightmare on Marvel Street""). But a greater threat to the Avengers hides in plain sight much close to home. Its name is Ultron and it begins life as a kind of ghost in the Stark Industries machine an artificially intelligent ""global peacekeeping initiative"" designed to serve as ""a suit of armor around the world."" Iron Man meet Iron Dome. As such brainchildren are wont to do in the annals of science fiction (where man routinely suffers for playing God) Ultron enters sentience with some major daddy issues and the temperament of a hormonal adolescent ready to bite (off) the hand that fed him and then some. When the character of Ultron first appeared in the ""Avengers"" comics circa 1968 he was the Frankenstein-like creation not of Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) but of ""Ant-Mans"" Hank Pym. But for the characters movie debut Whedon has made him over into a kind kind of power-mad Pinocchio (along with a few sly nods to the 1940 Disney animated classic) who needs no help from a fairy godmother to lance his strings assemble a makeshift suit of Stark Industries armor and raise an entire drone army in his own image. (Like father like son indeed.) The movies visual-effects wizards (a whopping 19 companies are credited) have a grand old time with Ultrons herky-jerky movements but James Spader has an even grander one giving voice to the machine-mans self-aggrandizing sentiments -- a diabolical purr that sounds like HAL 9000 reborn as a Vegas lounge lizard. Of course what Ultron wants most of all is to become a real live boy -- well that and to turn a sizable chunk of Sokovia into a meteorite to be hurled back at the Earth like a fast ball down the middle. But even as billions of lives hang in the balance ""Age of Ultron"" takes (welcome) time out to show us what our Avengers do when they arent busy avenging. In the case of Banner and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) that makes for a nicely hesitant romance between savage man-beast and the woman (with no shortage of her own emotional baggage) who knows how to soothe him. Ruffalo and Johansson have terrific chemistry together and they become the tender core of a movie that also makes a surprising reveal about the personal life of Jeremy Renners Clint Barton/Hawkeye and frequently reminds us that while sticks and (infinity) stones may scarcely harm these Marvel mainstays their psyches have suffered their fair share of heavy blows. (Taking his cue from those reviews that compared the first ""Avengers"" to a comicbook ""Rio Bravo"" Whedon has also amped up the Hawksian vibe here including some amusing macho posturing having to do with Thors mighty hammer.) When the movie does return to symphony-of-destruction mode it stays engaging precisely because Whedon has given us reasons to care -- at least a tiny bit -- about the all the whirring and smashing and booming and crashing. It helps that the actors by now wear these roles as comfortably as second skins -- an enviable model that those forthcoming superhero alliances ""Fantastic Four"" and ""Justice League"" can only hope to follow.  (Even Downey whose smirking sarcasm had already begun to wear thin by the time of ""Iron Man 3"" is kept relatively in check here despite his top billing.) And while Whedon still lacks the innately gifted image-making of his obvious role model Steven Spielberg (or of his fanboy contemporary J.J. Abrams) he keeps the movies heavy machinery in constant fluid motion. If this is what the apotheosis of branded big-studio entertainment has come to look like in 2015 we could be doing much worse. Unlike its title character ""Age of Ultron"" most definitely has soul. Working for the first time with British d.p. Ben Davis (""Guardians of the Galaxy"") Whedon thinks the film out in more cinematic terms than the prior installment with some complex tracking shots that last for upwards of a whole minute. Dueling composers Brian Tyler and Danny Elfman have provided a surfeit of speaker-rattling action music though the most memorable passages remain those recycled bits of Alan Silvestris brassy ""Avengers"" fanfare.

JulioIsYoung says May 12 2015 at 1251 am Some of the most unintentionally funniest comments Ive seen.... oh lord what stupidity some of these so called ""critics"" in the comment section have Theres this one twat that thinks hes a ""film connoisseur"" like wow... Insulting people who like movies that you clearly do not like. And the critic only gave a fair review. He enjoyed this movie. People can do that you know? While not a prime example of brilliant film Avenger Age of Ultron is a fun and exciting film that carries on the Marvel Superhero genre magic. Surely a film that will entertain anyone whos looking for a fun experience. Whedon does it again Reply Apocalypse (SE_Apocalypse) says May 11 2015 at 1255 am I want my time back reading (half) of that bad review. I mean age of ultron was bad enough but this review is worse D Reply Corey Myers says May 7 2015 at 1047 pm The moment you mentioned the first captain america movie as being distinguished from the superhero herd I lost all interest in this article. That movie was terrible like come on. Reply Mare says May 3 2015 at 925 pm Loved it Great movie. Loved seeing more of the characters and a deeper exploration of who they are and what they fear and fight for. Especially loved Mark Ruffalos Bruce Banner getting some more focus He was the real gem of ""The Avengers"" for me A tragic hero both sides of him. Really hoping they bring him into ""Civil War"" Reply Cristina Willigs says May 3 2015 at 643 pm Twighlight fans also were upset at the critics and they did love Kristen Stewart even if her acting was the worst part of those movies untill of course she ended her relationship with the guy by being a trampire outlining if you like things that arent exactly cultural relevant is all your problem but dont cry cause cultured people dont like it thats why critics have jobs and people who go to movies dont work as critics Reply Ben H says May 2 2015 at 715 pm Isnt everyone on here a barrel of laughs I thought AoU was great; i loved the visuals there were a couple of unexpected plot twists and I loved the little nods to future films such as Civil War. The reason theres an inter-team battle over Vision is a good one and I thought the film achieved a good balance between seriousness and humour. According to everyone here though that makes me some unsophisticated idiot with ""no real job prospects."" Wow. Way to pin down a guy based on his movie tastes. It seems to me like everyone here is a pessimist determined to LOOK for negativity and judge anyone who thinks differently. Me I look for the positives and found many. No it wasnt perfect (as a film I prefer The Winter Soldier) but all in all this is a great film. It also seems to me like most of you are a little older so actually in context its not so surprising that you dont like it; the demographic this is aimed at is the 12-25 young person demographic. That might be something to consider too. Reply Anthony Dodd (screenplayhouse) says May 2 2015 at 245 pm Full disclosure I consider these movies to be pure junk. A feeble step up from Harry Potter. Barely. That said -- ""the new movie is a sleeker faster funnier piece of work -- the sort of sequel (like ""Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan"" ""Superman II"" and ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" before it) that shrugs off the self-seriousness of its predecessor and fully embraces its inner Saturday-morning serial."" Wow. Way for the critic to discredit themselves. The first Trek was considered painfully bad the first Superman fantastic and the first Indiana Jones AMAZING. The second Trek was considered AMAZING the second Superman merely okay and the second Indiana Jones painfully bad. Know your movie history or dont bother speaking. Reply Franco Milazzo says May 11 2015 at 958 am 1. ""The first Trek was considered painfully bad"" etc If you need straw men to back up your arguments maybe you should watch more movies and come up with your own opinion. 2. The reviewer isnt commenting on the quality of the films he used as examples just that the sequels to each ""shrug off the self-seriousness of its predecessor and fully embrace its inner Saturday-morning serial."" Which is arguable but fair comment. Oh and that second Superman? Terrence Stamp was the best Zod ever. If anything Superman II was the best of the four in the original series especially as it didnt rely on a ridiculous ""Superman decides to change time just this once"" deus ex machina device like the first one. Reply John M Holt says May 2 2015 at 931 am Critics can be so amusing especially bad ones. Here you have a person who is ferociously trying his very best to be the best at his job. Only it isnt working. Simple minded and easily influenced individuals may buy into this garbage but there are a lot more sophisticated minds out there at large. It is easy to bash and pull apart a group of peoples work but it is something else to be able to find the good qualities in something when you are able to comprehend the art and hard work put into it. That being said It is easy to understand where critics are coming from because it is easy to be a critic. Being a connoisseur of film art is a very different quality all together. A lot of people ask how it is easy to be a critic? Well critics pull apart  destroy and find fault in work that isnt even theirs. Their work is destructive in nature. Common sense tells us that it is easier to destroy than it is to create. Reply Duder NME says May 4 2015 at 1031 am ""Common sense tells us that it is easier to destroy than it is to create."" Not anymore. Now we can do both at the same time. According to myth the Earth was created in six days... NOW WATCH OUT HERE COME GENESIS WELL DO IT FOR YOU IN SIX MINUTES Reply Brad says April 30 2015 at 911 pm Well I saw it. I liked the first Avengers wouldnt care if I missed this one. The movie was just messy. Lots of action but The 3D was distracting bringing forward chains holding up a tractor for no reason or bars on a jail cell. It doesnt seem this was shot for 3D like the first movie. The sound was horrible think of Bane from the last Batman movie and then multiply it by the number of characters. The plot what little of it there was is overly simplex. The writing is all over the place. The effects were good but over used and didnt help tell the story probably dozens of major effects a minute were scattered all over with no real cohesion. The dialog was horrible and the director should be ashamed of himself. It looked like the old days when we would start and stop the video camera to record bits and pieces of an event without editing. Reply Sandy Muller says April 30 2015 at 702 pm And now we meet the guy w/ the bow and arrows family. I flush more charm than Jeremy Renner. Honestly why did they decide that we had to get to know this guy? He is so boring. Jeremy Renner has no charisma.Look at Iron Man chop wood..... Look and all the endless computer-generated blurry robots. Sucks Reply master Yoda says April 28 2015 at 848 am I must admit I wanted to like this one but what happened? A bunch of whiners who turn on each other in a moments notice. Visuals are great but the movie is tedious. Bad guys switch teams in a heartbeat. Movie felt very LONG..... Reply NYCS says May 1 2015 at 1222 am Looks like the DC executives got into the comments section. Dont worry fellas your badly miscast Superman/Batman/Aquaman/WonderWaif/whatever movie will do ok too. Reply Britney says April 27 2015 at 939 am Just watched it on Mixvid Goooood movie Reply Rosemary Moraes Roberto Salgueiro says April 22 2015 at 955 pm Cool Action fun Thats all I was with my niece and a friend watched this movie and a lot of fun. Not always Movies needs to be reflective; can and should be fun too. Reply LOL says April 22 2015 at 114 pm These film are crap. Theyre made for those with indiscriminate tastes who love watching silly live action cartoons. Reply Anthony Dodd (screenplayhouse) says May 2 2015 at 341 pm Correct. Theyre made to glorify military manliness... since many audience members will be high school graduates with no real job prospects. This was painfully obvious in MAN OF STEEL TREK INTO DARKNESS and DARK NIGHT RISES. Reply NYCS says May 1 2015 at 1222 am Spike? Is that you? Reply TONY says April 23 2015 at 1147 am GET OVER YOURSELF. Reply Joe says April 22 2015 at 922 pm This comment is crap. Its made for those whose lives are so empty that they go on the Internet with the sole purpose of trashing movies they have no interest in watching. Reply Michael French says May 5 2015 at 124 pm OMG - cannot believe you guys are so worked up and critical of a kids movie made after kids comic book characters. Its a great and fun entertaining film that lasts as long as it lasts - just like a good comic book. You need to think as a kid before commenting. Lighten up and have a bit more fun ) anymous says April 23 2015 at 613 pm Wrong. This film represents nothing more than shrewdly executed corporate strategy toward market dominance (greed my friend) exploiting audience sentiment ruthlessly (and unfairly given the deep regard for the source material among fans) and consisting of nothing but dumb spectacle and re-regurgitated story (Let me take a stab bad guys challenge good guys good guys win or are on their way to winning?). Pathetic. Soulless indeed. I think the original commenters well-founded frustration may come from the fact that this is the tripe that dominates mainstream film culture. Open your fucking eyes. Frederick Louis Richardson says April 22 2015 at 957 am To read this sort of review (and I do enjoy reading them) the film seems Oscar-worthy. But that is not going to happen. As long as any movie makes money -- even one based on a self-fulfilling prophesy -- thats is all which is required. Reply Joel says April 22 2015 at 839 am Roo bad it doesnt mention how effective the 3D aspect is. Reply bobmcdade (bobmcdade) says April 30 2015 at 1248 pm I saw this in IMAX 3D and to be honest I would have preferred 2D. The 3D retrofit is unnecessary. It makes some of the action scenes visually unintelligible. Reply anymous says April 21 2015 at 1158 pm Vomits  sorry guys I cant  Vomits. Vomits. Reply NICK NLRT (nHiAcRkT) says April 21 2015 at 859 pm was it really necessary to go into detail about the finale of the movie and Ultrons plan? Arent movie reviews supposed to be spoiler-free? Reply Randall Starr says April 24 2015 at 1236 pm I agree but since some of the damn TV Spots have implicitly revealed the plan Ive pretty much given up. I cant stand it. I hated the entire marketing campaign of Avengers 2 from the dull ""no strings"" to the bombardment of THIRTY TV Spots each more spoilery than the last. Reply rowana says April 21 2015 at 955 pm This is an industry trade paper - it doesnt need to be spoiler-free. Reply Isacc Alves says April 21 2015 at 501 pm Another Marvel juvenule crap movie Im not going to watch Reply Sherman O says April 30 2015 at 633 pm Oh Isacc youre such a twit. For future reference please direct any and all of your lame insults at me personally...this way I can show my friends and we can all laugh at you together.
