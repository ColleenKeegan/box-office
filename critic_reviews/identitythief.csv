"Dr. Feelbad << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous Tituss Top 12 NCAA Power Rankings  Next Puck Luck Endgame Entertainment Facebook Twitter Print Dr. Feelbad Steven Soderberghs Side Effects is a quiet bummer -- but thats nothing compared to the problems with Identity Thiefs Melissa McCarthy by Wesley Morris on February 7 2013 Rooney Mara might be too inscrutable to be a star. Her face masks everything -- intent affection human warmth respiration. But shes not a zombie either. Shes inscrutable for the camera. To watch her in David Finchers version of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo or Steven Soderberghs Side Effects which opens tomorrow is to be psychologically seduced. Its not that you wonder whats going on with her. Its that you wonder what else is going on. Shes a directors actor that way a performer a filmmaker can trust to do fascinating things -- not simply to hold a close-up but to complicate it. Mara and Fincher kept The Dragon Tattoo from sliding further into kabuki garbage. She found a hundred ways to play about two facial expressions. Side Effects gives her more to do with a similarly mentally shaky woman and less physical space in which to do it. Mara is often enclosed here -- in small rooms and offices in New York City. Even in a capacious banquet space Soderbergh finds framing that makes her seem trapped. She plays a suicidal graphic designer named Emily. Emilys husband Martin (Channing Tatum) has just been released from prison for insider trading. All the trappings of their nouveau affluence are gone and even as he vows to climb back into the investment world shes in such a stupor that you cant imagine that she was ever more than a Stepford wife. Emily drives her car into a wall of a parking garage. She appears to contemplate walking off a Harlem subway platform. When Martin climbs on top of her and pumpdesigners away she rocks back and forth beneath him awake yet asleep. After the car crash an eager ethically lax psychiatrist named Dr. Jonathan Banks (Jude Law) begins treating Emily putting her on a new drug and the results are mixed. Her libido returns but her timings off. Breakfast for instance becomes a meal served in the evening. For a good stretch the movie is a quiet unobtrusive satire of the pharmaceutical world. Emilys boss (Polly Draper) catches her ill in the bathroom at work sees her bottle of pills and says ""These made me sick too. I had better luck with Celexa."" Soderbergh and his writer Scott Z. Burns find disturbing comedy in a world in which everyone is on something -- the famous stuff (Wellbutrin Effexor and Zoloft) and its amusingly named fictitious counterparts like Ablixa. Dr. Banks even gives his statuesque wife (Vinessa Shaw) his newest stuff. He takes money from a drug company to test out an antidepressant called Deletrex. But the dour social drama -- about a couple trying to rebuild a life together when one of them is seemingly too sad to move -- turns out to be a front for an altogether different enterprise the sort of thriller whose plot doesnt twist so much as round corners until a circle has been made. Soderbergh has been telling the press that he cant talk about Side Effects because to do so would be to ruin its surprises. And the film noir the movie becomes is a surprise. Theres a kind of fun in trying to assemble whats going on here. Could it be true what one character suspects another has done? And how will the character under suspicion keep trying to derail her accuser? Theres a Hitchcockiness about the movie and Laws doctor becomes the quintessential Hitchcock male a guy sinking in narrative quicksand. But even as you enjoy seeing where Soderbergh and Burns are trying to take these people -- including the insinuating psychiatrist (Catherine Zeta- Jones) Emily had before Martin was locked up -- its difficult to escape the impression that the movie is impressed only with its cleverness. Its only clever the way a crossword puzzles clever -- proud of the way it managed to pull off a bait-and-switch not once but genre-wise three times. Theres an incarceration movie a sex thriller and a potboiler in here. The movie has a cold foreboding air not unlike the one Philip Kaufman supplied for his 1978 version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Formally Soderbergh does Kaufman one better shooting digitally which enhances the impression that in every scene someones left open the freezer door. Despite its attempts to warm its hands by the fires of luridness the film itself feels medicated against the blues. It doesnt have the pop ingenuity of movies like Out of Sight his Oceans capers Contagion The Informant or Magic Mike. Its him in the jazzier muffled experimental mode of Bubble and The Girlfriend Experience and Haywire. Side Effects is pop-ish eventually strapping the actors (nearly all of whom are excellent though Tatum has almost nothing to do) in for the roller-coaster plot. But its a ride that feels like its moving in slow motion. This is alleged to be Soderberghs second-to-last film before he takes a voluntary leave from moviemaking. He told the Boston Globe that he needs time to ""reassess."" If he cant come back as someone completely new he wont come back at all. Its a shame for him to pack it in (hes only 50) especially given that he might have found his ideal on-screen woman in Mara. She can toy with expectations and ambivalence and she can certainly play Soderberghs wily head games. At the time of Contagion it seemed ludicrous for Soderbergh to quit and take up painting or philanthropy or whatever else he might plan to do. He was still one of the best directors in and around Hollywood. But hes always seemed torn about the director he wanted to -- or was supposed to? -- be. How much art to create? How much artiness? How seriously to take it? How seriously should he pursue an audience? As a moviegoer it could be exciting watching a major director struggle with his sense of independence working far outside the studio system one minute and thriving within it the next. Is the hours-long vividly discursive ideologically thin revolution epic Che who he is? Or is he the guy so skilled at ensemble heist comedies that now anytime you see a group of people robbing anything you think fondly of him? The movie thats always seemed to embody Soderberghs ambivalence was Full Frontal his gag from 2002 on the absurdities of the film industry. He wanted to bite the hand of a business that he seemed to like. The movie was loaded with movie stars and wanted to skewer his impression of Hollywoods shallowness and pampering but Soderbergh wasnt say Robert Altman. He was doing his stabbing with a spork. Side Effects might actually be a clearer window into his foggy state of mind. It doesnt know what it is. ""Depression"" Dr. Banks says ""is the inability to construct a future."" This retirement of Soderberghs might be an attempt to assess his ontology to construct a future. The final shot is of someone looking out a window trapped. Soderbergh makes you feel the dreadful claustrophobia of that moment. Its as if he thinks the walls are closing in on him too. Ultimately what Side Effects turns into on Jude Laws end is the sort of movie Michael Douglas typified in his prime white guys under siege. Douglas could be just as famous making the same post-Wall Street movies Fatal Attraction The War of the Roses Basic Instinct Falling Down Disclosure The Game A Perfect Murder Traffic. But the reception would be different. The reason Django Unchained and Lincoln are such big hits is that they reconfigure the cultural terrain. Douglas was usually affronted. Women and brown people were tearing either at his life or at the fabric of this great nation. Now he wouldnt be allowed to be so outsize a figure of put-upon-ness. Hed either have to help free the slaves or have the slaves beat him. But Ive come to miss Douglass entitled chutzpah his ability to avenge most of the wrongs he perceives have been done to him. He was the kind of star youd want to see stand up to Django. Identity Thief is a loud dreary example of how far the movies have drifted from his mix of righteousness paranoia and remorseless self-belief. Jason Bateman plays a nobody internal accounts manager at a Denver financial firm who discovers that a woman (Melissa McCarthy) in Florida has stolen his Social Security number. Shes going on spending sprees with his androgynous name (Sandy Patterson) and excellent credit. As with Douglas the system is suddenly broken for him and he has to take matters into his own hands. Bateman typifies spineless sarcasm thats best when its spread throughout a comedy with a large cast. But the movies seem to have settled on him for a leading man because this is how the men writing and directing our movies see themselves -- handsome smart-ass family men who cant get a break. Bateman isnt a star but hes become one in a vacuum of masculinity affronted and otherwise. Even as one of the movies producers theres no way he cant be blamed for the wretchedness of this movie which has been pumped full of road-trip cliches by Craig Mazin directed by Seth Gordon and dropped into megaplexes with no idea of what kind of comedy it is (so it is no kind). The police threaten to arrest Sandy at his brand-new job because the woman whos stolen his identity also appears to be mixed up in some kind of guns-and-drugs ring. For reasons that make almost no sense (especially if theyre actually legal) the Denver detectives cant coordinate their investigation with anyone in Florida so Sandy proposes leaving his two daughters and pregnant wife (Amanda Peet) going south and dragging his imposter back west for arrest. Obviously shes reluctant to go violently so. Obviously she comes around. Obviously theres some reason they cant fly. Obviously they have to share a series of doomed cars including one that resembles what the Beltway snipers drove. And of course theyre chased by two thugs (T.I. and Genesis Rodriguez) and a bounty hunter (Robert Patrick). Theres a raunchy night in a motel room mayhem on the interstate and lines like ""I got no time. I got no money. I got no chance."" Of course Sandy experiences a change of heart about the crook whos ruined his life. But the movie goes even beyond that daring to give her a Pretty Woman makeover a Dickensian backstory and an ending you could try to roast marshmallows by. (After a minute with these two in a car you long for the movie that must have partially inspired this one -- Midnight Run the very good 1988 comedy with Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin.) This isnt comedy. Its the finale of Misery. That ending in Identity Thief comes after weve seen Eric Stonestreet (Modern Familys Cam) vigorously bed McCarthy after a speeding car sends her flying 20 feet in the air after which she bounces right up and Bateman asks ""Are you even human?"" Its a fair question. The answer in movies is no. McCarthys fatness is the joke. The history of the movies doubles as a loose figurative history of clowns and clowning Chaplin Sennett Keaton Tati Lewis Murray Carrey. Identity Thief puts lots of McCarthy in lots of bright nonsense outfits. It puffs out her red hair -- the preferred color of funny women (Ball Midler Roberts Messing Stone) -- gives her a ludicrous makeup job and dresses her in bright bozo prints. McCarthy is literally a clown. Those costumes her size and the athleticism that belies it permit an audience to roar when McCarthys character jumps drunk from a bar and crashes to the floor when Bateman chucks a George Foreman grill at her or whacks her with a guitar as if he were Prince Fielder. This isnt comedy. Its the finale of Misery. Goldie Hawn played this sort of sociopath with Steve Martin in HouseSitter a so-so farce from 1992. The surprise was in Hawns bringing a clinical craziness to her ditz persona. With Identity Thief McCarthys being a clown is supposed to keep us from caring that she makes no psychological sense. Were not supposed to notice that shes either an alcoholic or schizophrenic or 4 years old. McCarthy lets the movies see her as a buffoon although Im guessing she pushed to give the character some last-minute humanity -- because shes not a clown shes a comedic actress. You can see that on Mike amp; Molly. Its a terrible sitcom but the parameters of the format give her approach to comedy some normalcy both to push against and maintain. Shes very good there and no ones asking her to eat a rack of ribs or lean in Robert Patricks face and say ""Oh God. Your beard smells like sandwiches."" This is a woman who could probably do anything as a movie comedian. She needs decently outlined characters that let her create a persona not do more of this ADD wilding out. You wonder what she could have done with Rooney Maras part in Soderberghs movie. Gordon appears to be specializing in regressive comedies. Four Christmases and Horrible Bosses are also his. The laughs dont stem from wit or setups but from phony rage and cheap slapstick. His best movie remains his first feature a documentary about two rival Donkey Kong champions called The King of Kong. Hollywood appears to have discouraged him from exploring the easy human comedy of that movie and pushed him into live-action cartoons. Itd be nice to see him earn warmth rather than use it to insult us. At some point the soundtrack coughs up James Browns ""The Payback"" and its a delusional song choice. You dont care enough about these people to want to see them come out on top.

Here she has unfortunately chosen the latter. She plays a scheming sociopath who runs a lucrative fake credit card scam by posing as an online security company. The latest schmuck dumb enough to give her his details is corporate bookkeeper Sandy Patterson (Jason Bateman) whose life hits a downward spiral as a result causing him to travel across country and bring his tormentor to justice. So after grinding through a few topical story gears Identity Thief settles into a formula odd-couple road movie. It saddles Bateman with a thankless uptight straight-man role while heaping serial slapstick ignominies on his co-star who gamely bounds through everything the script throws at her. A single laugh just before the end counts as a poor return for any so-called comedy. But even worse is the sheer cynicism involved in assuming its okay to portray full-figured McCarthys character as a physically ridiculous unloved and unlovable monster providing shes given a couple of moments that show her in a sympathetic light. Ugly and seriously unfunny.

You get the point then. 5 Shares Share 2 Tweet 3 Share 0 Share Email Print Share Jason Bateman and Melissa McCarthy in Identity Theft Photo Guy DAlema/Universal Pictures Identity Thief is funny enough but it needed to be darker raunchier and crazier to live up to the promise of its casting. Melissa McCarthys awesomely nasty life-force transformed Bridesmaids and while Jason Bateman has been coasting on straight-man roles for a while now he can elevate his game to the surrealism of his milieu when presented with the right material (Arrested Development Extract). Both actors have wild streaks a mile wide but alas Seth Gordons comedy is content to deliver just a few yuks on its way to a surprisingly earnest and bland payoff. The idea is pretty basic and the movie launches into it with its very first scene Sandy Patterson (Bateman) a well-meaning overly trusting family man living in Denver falls for a comically simple identity scam perpetrated by a woman from Florida (McCarthy whose character is eventually known as Diana though were never quite sure if thats her real name). Soon enough shes racking up massive bar tabs hairdresser appointments and God knows what else in his (unisex) name -- and of course not paying. The movies early scenes have an engagingly paranoid quality as Sandys life collapses around him thanks to insane purchases and police run-ins in some distant Florida town hes never even heard of. When the police prove comically useless he decides he has to take matters into his own hands and goes in search of his tormentor North by Northwest-style. Sandy finds Diana as soon as hes in Florida and not long after that theyre in a car headed to Denver so Sandy can show Diana to his boss and the cops and get his life back. Meanwhile some very cross drug dealers are also following them as is a grizzled bounty hunter but the baddies dont make much of an impression. Its all basically just an excuse to put these two characters into your typical odd-couple-on-the-road situation not unlike Planes Trains and Automobiles or the more recent Due Date A straight-laced square and an overweight hedonist go on a quest and learn life lessons from one another. In this case she teaches him to stick up for himself and he teaches her how to be a better person particularly through his exchanges with his family back home. The movie certainly has its raunchy moments (a motel room encounter between Diana and a good old boy shes picked up -- played by Modern Familys Eric Stonestreet -- gets surprisingly sexually gruesome) and there are a couple of decent running gags (Diana likes to pretend that Sandy is her husband and that hes suffering from horrific genital deficiencies). But they dont quite feel as if they belong; theyre like pit stops along a more conventional earnest route. The actors do what they can. Bateman is likable as usual but he really has taken this nice-guy shtick about as far as its likely to go. As for McCarthy she pulls off a deceptively tough balancing act playing a reasonably charming and outgoing person who also happens to be a total sociopath. (In other words shes both John Candy and Chris Farley. To compare her to her overweight male forebears is deeply wrong but hard to resist.) That the film doesnt allow her to do more with this odd potentially hilarious mix is among its chief crimes. Youll laugh but you might also cry at how much more you could have laughed.

In recent years perhaps only Zach Galifianakis in ""The Hangover"" has had a comparable impact. McCarthy was lewd and fearless a woman unashamed of her size and her sexual appetite. How to follow that? Theres no question she represents a challenge for Hollywood not only because the industry still struggles to believe women can carry movies but also because screen glamour is synonymous with thin.

Hide Caption 12 of 12Her first star vehicle ""Identity Thief"" is not likely to be remembered as anyones triumph (its scoring in the 20-something percentile on the critics aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes) but at least it does enough to show that McCarthy has what it takes. If she forges a movie career she could really shake things up. Shes not quite flying solo of course. Jason Bateman has top billing as Sandy Patterson a financial officer in a big Denver firm. When reports start coming in that hes maxed out his credit card in Florida Sandy is naturally upset. Turns out McCarthy has stolen his identity and is running up big bills on all his accounts. Oh and shes missed her court date which means theres an arrest warrant out in his name. Mustering enough cash to fly down there Sandy decides to apprehend the imposter himself and escort her back to Colorado so that they can straighten out the mess before he loses his job and his home. She may be a scam artist but Sandy reckons she looks harmless enough.And that would be his fatal error If there is one thing McCarthy means to prove its surely that one look is not enough because there is so much more to her than meets the eye. In one of the movies better running gags she proves it again and again when she delivers a vicious sucker punch to the throat of anyone foolish enough to threaten her well-being. McCarthy as Diana (which may or may not be her real name) is not about to give up without a fight. But shes also slippery in more subtle ways an operator who knows how to manipulate people with the way she looks and how she talks. In some cases that involves playing on their pity -- and on ours too as the filmmakers imply that her weight is a symptom of her unhappy life. But McCarthy has the personality to subvert this because her Diana may be lonely but she is still more vital more spontaneous and more fun than Sandy is ever likely to be. In the best most daring sequence she picks up a guy in a bar (Eric Stonestreet as Big Chuck) and persuades him back to their motel room to have sex with her in front of her husband Sandy who ""likes to watch."" Its all a ploy to make an escape but the scene pivots -- Big Chuck makes it about emotion not sex and she responds to his openness. Then things get physical. McCarthy pulls off these shifts with gusto but also delicacy and yes tact. In a sharper movie (and lets shoot for the moon here -- Barbara Stanwyck as the con woman in ""The Lady Eve"") Diana would play Batemans smug executive for a sucker and take him for everything hes got. But in these recessionary times even financial officers can be sympathetic underdogs and instead the film contents itself with puerile cracks about his manhood and undeveloped hints that her bad influence might rub off in a good way.Written by Craig Mazin (""The Hangover Part II"") and directed by Seth Gordon (""Horrible Bosses"") ""Identity Thief"" borrows too much from the likes of ""Midnight Run"" and ""Planes Trains amp; Automobiles"" without giving enough back -- especially since ""Due Date"" already went that route quite recently. But even with all its shortcomings and sentimental fudges there is something about McCarthys refusal to lie down and play the victim that gives it a comic edge. A blunt edge to be sure but an edge all the same.

"Identity Thief is lazy crude and unfunny Review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesIdentity Thief is lazy crude and unfunny ReviewIdentity Thief starring Jason Bateman and Melissa McCarthy is lazy crude and unfunny.Melissa McCarthy is a Florida-based serial scammer in Identity Thief. She deserves better.  (Universal Pictures)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Feb. 7 2013Identity ThiefStarring Jason Bateman Melissa McCarthy Jon Favreau and Amanda Peet. Directed by Seth Gordon. 108 minutes. Opening Friday at major theatres. 14AIdentity Thief Identity Thief has an identity problem of its own. Is it a zany Three Stooges-inspired road-trip smack-fest or a sentimental exploration of a lonely womans spiral into larcenous-fuelled shopping addiction?Mostly its just the kind of lazy crudely unfunny filmmaking that all too often passes for comedy of late ripping off Midnight Run and Trains Planes and Automobiles in the service of getting bums into theatre seats during the February box office doldrums.Article Continued BelowWritten by Craig Mazin (The Hangover Part II) and directed by Seth Gordon (the funny Horrible Bosses -- what happened?) watching the trailer for Identity Thief will save you close to two hours and tell you all you need to know about this sloppily made exercise of rip-offs and redemption.Mild-mannered number-cruncher Sandy Bigelow Patterson (Arrested Developments Jason Bateman) is a sad sack who suffers at the hands of a Ayn Rand-obsessed boss (Jon Favreau) who keeps Trish his pregnant wife (Amanda Peet) and two adorable moppets in near poverty -- Hollywoods version of poverty that is.A new job could ease his woes but that plan is put on hold when Sandy finds himself the victim of a Florida-based serial scammer (Oscar-nominated Bridesmaids co-star Melissa McCarthy who deserves better). Diana has scooped his ""unisex"" name and is swiping homemade credit cards linked to Sandy so fast they burst into flames.Thanks to plot devices that appear cooked up via Internet plug-ins the cops cant help and Sandy has to pack his handcuffs and go to Florida to bring Diana to justice back in his Denver hometown.A sleazy bounty hunter (Robert Patrick) a pair of drug-dealer enforcers (T.I. and Genesis Rodriguez) and Modern Familys Eric Stonestreet macho-ing it up as a horny cowboy get involved in various ways as Diane and Sandy head west.McCarthy who showed her considerable comic skills in Bridesmaids plays the largely unlikeable scammer and brings some depth to the role when shes not punching people in the throat or making clumsy come-ons to everything in trousers.She also takes more than a few body shots herself; a hefty woman is always an acceptable onscreen target in ways her svelte sisters would never be. After all McCarthy has done the only thing worse in the eyes of Hollywood than aging; shes fat. So when Diana gets slammed in the back of the head with a guitar or creamed by a tossed appliance its all fair in love and war and higher-than-acceptable BMIs.Eventually Diana reveals herself to be chasing something else with her manic shopping but any goodwill that could generate was lost long before when a snake crawled up Sandys pant leg and he jettisoned his chinos. Thats followed by an ending so contrived and dumb it belongs in the crapitude hall of fame. Really guys this is the best you can do?

Andrew OHehir Follow Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Comedy Identity Thief Melissa McCarthy Movies Entertainment News (Credit Bob Mahoney) If the Jason Bateman-Melissa McCarthy comedy ""Identity Thief"" isnt the worst Hollywood comedy ever made thats only because it lacks the spark of conviction and genius - the thoroughly misguided belief in itself - that distinguishes something like Adam Sandlers ""Grown Ups."" But considering that it starts out with two distinctive and likable stars and a reasonably promising premise ""Identity Thief"" reaches impressive heights of laziness and idiocy. Were always supposed to say that actors are not responsible for their most terrible films but it isnt quite enough for Bateman and McCarthy to fire their agents or return unopened next years holiday cards from whatever Universal Pictures executive actually watched this film and then decided to release it. They need to seriously consider firing themselves or at least placing themselves on administrative leave (also known in this business as television).I almost never walk out of movie screenings that Ive actually bestirred myself to attend but only some perverse and self-punishing sense of honor kept me in my seat for this one. Here I am two hours closer to the moment of my death and I spent those hours wriggling like a toddler while McCarthy mimed oral sex on corpulent cowboys and Bateman desperately mugged his way through a role as Sandy Patterson a supposedly average corporate drone who is endlessly mocked for having a ""girls name."" I see that aimless gag as unhappily symbolic; no one in this movie has a wide enough frame of reference to have met a guy named Sandy before and the movie itself displays exactly the same kind of ignorance and incuriosity not to mention free-floating paranoia.I remember laughing at an Ayn Rand joke early on which suggested that Craig Mazins screenplay once contained some vague political ambitions. Trying to explain to Sandy why the brass at his financial firm are receiving six- or seven-figure bonuses while the regular schmoes get diddly-squat his jerkass boss tells him ""Ill get you a copy of The Fountainhead. Then youll see why this is good for everybody."" And once in a while McCarthys nasty-girl shtick is amusing as when she finally meets Sandys wife (Amanda Peet criminally underutilized here) and assures her in overly graphic woman-to-woman detail that nothing happened between her and Sandy on their long and intimate road trip across the country with rednecks and black people in hot pursuit.I refuse to offer anything like a normal plot synopsis because that might imply to the gullible that this movie makes any damn sense or that theres some reason to care about what happens in what order. McCarthy plays a brassy Florida hustler who may or may not be named Diana and who uses a lame low-tech ruse to borrow Sandys identity run up massive debts on his accounts get arrested under his name and so forth. All that is vaguely possible - although its more likely to involve someone in Estonia or West Africa - but I cant even really explain why Sandy whos supposedly a financial professional cant deal with this through official channels and feels the need to fly to Florida and confront an unknown criminal in person. I mean that makes sense right? You Might Also Like Well OK - this happens because Mazin or director Seth Gordon (of ""Horrible Bosses"" which seemed atrocious at the time but now looks like a lost masterwork of Preston Sturges) or some suit in Burbank decided they wanted and I quote ""a Planes Trains and Automobiles meets Midnight Run type of thing."" Whoever said that yawned and went back to sleep with a copy of ""The Fountainhead"" over his face leaving the filmmakers to inflict their incoherent rage on the audience. So we get Sandy a high-strung and not super-likable character and the poorly defined Diana whos a little bit the Funny-Sexy Fat Chick and a little bit the Scary-Pathetic Crazy Woman driving across the country together in a rented Ford Focus with multiple plot-complication-slash-criminal-stereotypes after them for unclear reasons. Christ its painful. Apparently only two things can happen to you if you leave the interstate in America - you wind up in a weird three-way sex situation with a fat and hairy cowboy or if you venture into anything that resembles nature you wind up covered with snakes one of which immediately goes for the nads. I suppose in Freudian terms its the same thing and the makers of ""Identity Thief"" are performing a public service by reminding us to stay home lest the snake-dicked Texas bisexuals get us. Maybe this is a remake of ""Deliverance"" disguised as comedy. I would respect ""Identity Thief"" a little more if it ended with that sort of vision of chaos and terror and despair. But of course it doesnt retreating from all its icky paranoid and hostile gags into the dumbest kind of sentimental conclusion where everybody loves everybody. Not me though not after this.

Identity Thief (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Identity Thief (R) Melissa McCarthy deserves better than this formulaic road-trip comedy. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com2/8/2013 Editor rating 1 In Identity Thief Melissa McCarthy gets smacked in the face with a frying pan conked on the head with a toaster run over by a car and suffers a hundred other bits of violent slapstick and you laugh almost every time. Then the moment passes and the movie reverts to crummy. McCarthy has been acting for years but her popularity blew up after her supporting performance in Bridesmaids in which she relieved herself explosively in a bathroom sink. She is an immensely likable screen presence who is fearless at making herself look ridiculous and the combination of her girth and surprising agility recall Animal House-era John Belushi. In contemporary Hollywood she is one of a kind and how many actresses can say that? Unfortunately no matter how hard McCarthy tries Identity Thief remains an unsalvageable wreck. She plays Diana a loud and gregarious woman who looks like a super-sized Raggedy Ann doll with her shock of long red hair and flair for eyeball-searing ensembles. Diana is a computer-savvy con artist who tricks people into giving her their Social Security numbers and birth dates then cranks out fake credit cards and goes on costly shopping sprees. Shes a hoarder of bright new appliances Three dishwashers four microwaves even an enormous jet ski she keeps parked on her front lawn. But she picks the wrong target when she goes after Sandy (Jason Bateman) a husband and father of two kids with another on the way who has just gotten a promotion when the police show up accusing him of credit fraud. Identity Thief was directed by Seth Gordon who made the amusing Horrible Bosses but also the torturously unfunny Four Christmases. Sadly thats the one his new movie most resembles. Sandy who lives in Denver heads out on a road trip to Florida where Diana lives to track her down and somehow bring her back to Colorado so he can clear his name. To say that she wont go easily is an understatement. Bateman is a talented actor who has fallen into the Ben Stiller trap of playing the same character in every movie The ordinary guy with extraordinarily bad luck who serves as straight man to his wild co-stars. Identity Thief is a road comedy which means there are lots of car chases and crashes and a scene in which McCarthy sings along to every song Bateman tunes into on the radio. There are also hit men and bounty hunters because the two lead characters arent enough to warrant almost two hours of screen time on their own so why not throw in some superfluous killers and bad guys? Most unforgivable of all Identity Thiefs sins though is the dreaded third-act veer into sentimentality with tearful confessions and heartwarming revelations and Dianas transformation from ugly duckling into a beautiful swan. Why do  filmmakers succumb to the urge to giving their comedies a sentimental streak? Its like the ending of Planes Trains and Automobiles.Was that really necessary? Turning McCarthy into an object of misunderstood pity who only needed a beauty makeover and a nice dress to fit in with society undercuts everything thats funny about her performance. The actress tries her best to sell the poignancy but her talent only makes it worse because you start feeling sorry for her character and Identity Thief apparently forgets it was supposed to be a comedy.

Comments (1) click to enlarge Identity Thief Video Rated R  112 minutes  2013 Melissa McCarthy knows how to use her bulk; she hurls herself around the screen as dangerously as Chris Farley or John Belushi and I cant think of any woman in American movie comedy quite like her. She also registers some credibly poignant moments in this otherwise rote feature which exhausts most of the comic potential from identity theft in the first 20 minutes and then turns into a solid but unexceptional road picture. Jason Bateman costars as a Denver family man who loses his corporate job after McCarthys character a wacko in Winter Park Florida steals his identity and runs up enormous debts in his name; in a rather unlikely turn of events his boss grants him a one-week reprieve so he can travel out to Florida bring her back and clear himself. Seth Gordon (Horrible Bosses) directed; with Robert Patrick as a bearded skip tracer chasing the two antagonists. By J.R.

"Melissa McCarthy in Identity Thief reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Melissa McCarthy Deserves Better Than Identity Thief Melissa McCarthy Deserves Better Than Identity Thief Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Feb. 8 2013 1212 PM Identity Thief Melissa McCarthy and the problem of the grotesque. By Dana Stevens Jason Bateman as Sandy Patterson and Melissa McCarthy as Diana in Identity Thief. Photo by Guy DAlema/Universal Pictures Watching Identity Thief the new Seth Gordon road comedy starring Jason Bateman and Melissa McCarthy I found myself thinking a lot about the female comic grotesque. Its easy and safe to space in and out of such abstractions during the viewing of Identity Thief--the story proceeds along well-worn tracks and can be rejoined without confusion at any time while the chances of missing out on a big laugh are alas minimal. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. On the current American movie landscape female comedians working in the grotesque vein--most notably McCarthy along with the suddenly everywhere Rebel Wilson--occupy an uneasy position between feminist trailblazers and preservers of the status quo. On the one hand the fact that their extra-large bodies lie outside the narrowly prescribed realm of leading-lady desirability--that they belong to no category ending with the letters -ILF--gives them the freedom to explore over-the-top ""unfeminine"" behavior with glorious impunity. (Think of McCarthy expressing her raw animal lust to the air marshal played by her real-life husband in Bridesmaids or Wilson defiantly reveling in her plus-size bulk as Pitch Perfects self-christened ""Fat Amy."") On the other hand the range of roles available to actresses like McCarthy and Wilson (both of whom like any right-thinking comedy fan I would like to see in as many movies as possible) can be as narrow as the performers themselves are wide. Diana the needy amoral grifter whos the title character of Identity Thief may be the most brazenly grotesque character McCarthys played yet though she exists somewhere on the same spectrum with the proudly eccentric sister-in-law of Bridesmaids. Tacky loud and oblivious to all social and moral codes Diana dresses in hideously garish clothes and is prone to drooly open-mouthed naps. Shes also unbridled in all her appetites whether for food alcohol or sex. In the movies raunchiest scene (the only one that justifies its R rating) she engages in a yee-hawing motel tryst with a lonely cowboy played by Modern Familys Eric Stonestreet. Its not even feminist theorizing to say that Diana represents femaleness at its most abject Shes explicitly positioned by the story as the worlds most unappealing woman the unfuckable absolute. (Hence I guess the purported hilarity of her encounter with Stonestreets equally abject Big Chuck. Two fat people having sex Oh my sides.) Advertisement Thanks to McCarthys abundant comic gifts and those of her equally ill-served straight man Jason Bateman Identity Thief doesnt leave nearly as icky a taste as it could have but Gordon--whose Horrible Bosses I found similarly underscripted and flat--only taps into a fraction of his actors potential. Bateman plays Sandy Bigelow a stressed-out accountant at a Denver financial firm whose shot at a lucrative new job is threatened when he learns that someone in Florida has stolen his good name and is busily besmirching it racking up drunk-and-disorderlies and stratospheric unpaid bills. Sandy stands to lose a lot if he cant track down the faux Sandy Bigelow and wrest back his life from her He has two lovely children not to mention a beautiful pregnant wife (Amanda Peet) whos bizarrely forbearing about her husbands increasingly cryptic phone calls from the road. I need to check and make sure my credit-card company offers a better fraud-insurance program than Sandy Bigelows--one that gives cardholders options besides flying to the thiefs home city breaking into her house and forcing her to come along on a cross-country drive back to Denver. Along the way Sandy and Diana (if that is her real name) encounter significant obstacles As it turns out shes being pursued simultaneously by a model-gorgeous pair of bickering hired killers (Genesis Rodriguez and T.I.) and a grizzled credit-company ""skip tracer"" (Robert Patrick). And then there are the car crashes. And the bank heist. And the rattlesnake up the pant leg. It would be easier to forgive Identity Thief its overfamiliar comic setups and shameless gag-recycling (someone is throat-punched by McCarthy approximately every 20 minutes and endless ""fun"" is had with the gender neutrality of Sandys first name) if the movies second half didnt make such an abrupt about-face from soliciting our revulsion to begging for our pity. Worse still the movies final scenes attempt to reshape the vulgar anarchic Diana into something resembling an acceptable rom-com heroine. In a makeover sequence that approaches The Breakfast Clubs in its deep philosophical wrongness Diana submits to the ministrations of three catty department-store employees who openly mock her appearance before beckoning her over and transforming her into a tastefully styled slimmingly black-clad beauty. Now theres a moment where a throat punch or three might have come in handy. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

"Identity Thief | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; identity-thief ) Identity Thief (United States 2013) February 08 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli A lot of movies released into theaters deserve the label of ""bad."" Only a few cross the line into ""reprehensible."" Say hello to Identity Thief. The big problem with this overlong tedious would-be comedy has nothing to do with the quality (or lack thereof) of its so-called humor. After all everyone has a different definition of what constitutes ""funny."" The catastrophic misstep taken by this film is an attempt to incorporate a dramatic element to the proceedings. By going in this direction its no longer possible to view Identity Thief as a compilation of questionable fat jokes sex gags and slapstick. Instead we are forced to absorb a cloying artificial ""serious"" aspect that is so poorly rendered that it torpedoes any hope the movie has of succeeding. This feels a lot like some of the recent unwatchable Adam Sandler offerings boorish unfunny comedy colliding with saccharine quasi-dramatic filler. Im not going to spend much time talking about the movies comedic elements. Theyre distilled from the essence that imbues the likes of Bridesmaids and Bachelorette although not as forcefully. For lack of a better term the humor in Identity Thief is more restrained than in those films although theres still projectile vomiting and gratuitous sex jokes. Screenwriter Craig Mazin did a significantly better job with a similar level material in his previous feature The Hangover Part II. At any rate the trailer for Identity Thief offers an excellent sampling of the humor contained within. If you find yourself rolling on the floor laughing after watching it its a good bet the film will provide more than the two or three feeble chuckles it gave me. Identity Thief starts out as a comedy about a nice clean-cut play-by-the-rules guy Sandy Patterson (Jason Bateman) who travels from the Colorado home he shares with his wife Trish (Amanda Peet) and two daughters to Florida. His goal track down the woman who stole his identity trashed his credit rating and cost him his job. Shes Diana (Melissa McCarthy) a fat foul-mouthed cartoon creature who wallows in excess as she adds to Sandys debt. While theres some comedic potential in the early encounters between Sandy and Diana it quickly evaporates as a series of impossible-to-swallow contrivances (including two mob enforcers and a bounty hunter) forces these two on a road trip that transforms Identity Thief into a mismatched buddy film. Thats when the production already derailed falls off a cliff. In a failed attempt to make Diana sympathetic were given a sob story about her tragic youth abandoned as a baby brought up in six different foster families lonely and unloved. The screenplay expects us to sympathize with her and its not joking around. This isnt meant to be satirical or farcical. Melissa McCarthy is given a big dramatic scene in which she bemoans the many miseries of her life. Can you hear the violins in the musical score? Bad Movie Time Dilation applies to Identity Thief. The stated running length is 111 minutes but the experience of sitting through this seems to last a lot longer. You enter the theater with youthful vigor and a full head of hair and exit it balding and with arthritic joints. Every minute spent watching Identity Thief is like an hour in an oubliette. Director Seth Gordons previous feature Horrible Bosses wasnt an apex of comedy but it contained enough clever moments to make it worthwhile. Little if any of what worked in Horrible Bosses is evident in Identity Thief which miscalculates more than a monkey with an abacus. And the likeability of Jason Batemans everyman nice guy only makes Melissa McCarthys Diana more troll-like and vile. (At one point shes called a hobbit but an orc or goblin would be more appropriate.) The films cavalier attitude toward identity theft also leaves a bad taste. Intentional or not Identity Thief comes with a morale We should show lovingkindness to these criminals despite their wrongdoings because their deprived upbringing excuses their behavior. Yes Identity Thief has a sermon embedded in the subtext and the existence of that homily not to mention its content is the most unforgiveable thing of all. ""Reprehensible"" pretty much covers it.

Universal Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide I squirmed in my seat throughout ""Identity Thief"" a colossally unfunny and misguided comedy starring two comic actors who deserve a lot better. Jason Bateman plays Sandy Patterson a nebbishy Denver corporate accountant whose identity is stolen by Diana a serial rip-off artist played by Melissa McCarthy in full cry. In order to restore his life he tracks her across the country and attempts to bring her to justice.What is it about road-trip movies these days that makes them so bad? I had only recently recovered from ""The Guilt Trip"" and now this. (Rent ""Something Wild"" if you want to see the real road-trip deal.) The premise is far from funny the way in which it is carried out is even less so (subplots include pursuits by bounty hunters and contract killers) and Bateman and McCarthy are left stranded onscreen while we are supposed to be chortling at slobber comedy and fat jokes.

(UNIVERSAL) Jason Bateman is one of the most generous straight men around always happy to make a co-star look good. Melissa McCarthy is one of most courageous comedians working willing to go anywhere for a laugh. Which is good. Because sitting through ""Identity Theft"" takes a lot of courage and liking it requires a ton of generosity. The mostly mirthless comedy stars McCarthy -- decked out in a bad perm and blue eye-shadow -- as a con woman with a ton of aliases a suitcase full of sob stories and a lucrative sideline in fake credit cards. All she ever needs is a schnook to give up his Social Security number. Cue super schnook Bateman who cluelessly gives her the key to his identity -- and his bank accounts. Suddenly his credit is ruined his job is in jeopardy and he has the cops after him. So what can he do except find her grab her and make her clear things up? Well a lot of things probably. The idea that this mild-mannered accounts-payable guy is suddenly going to turn bounty hunter -- when a few calls to his credit-card companies and a trip to a good lawyer would probably suffice -- doesnt make much sense. But then this is a script from the comic genius behind ""The Hangover Part II"" ""Scary Movie"" parts 3 and 4 and probably a few more awful sequels to come. (In fact almost definitely - hes the writer of ""The Hangover Part III."") And logic has nothing to do with it. Laughs neither. We do though get plenty of jokes about thickly accented Latina spitfires mincing gay hairdressers and fat people having sex. McCarthy vomits in one persons face and punches four or five other people in the larynx (I lost count). And there are a lot of gags about Batemans masculinity since his characters name is Sandy. `Cause -- yuk -- thats like a girls name. Yuk. Bateman is a patient pleasant foil throughout (although isnt it time a comedy let him cut loose on his own?) McCarthy meanwhile remains ever game and willing and does no end of physical comedy. Some real acting too -- there are a few scenes where she goes for and nails some true emotional moments. And she creates some laughs of her own -- but then if you saw any of the outtakes from ""Bridesmaids"" or ""This Is 40"" you know this is someone for whom the script is merely a launching pad. Which is good because this script really isnt much. And neither is director Seth Gordon. He previously saw Bateman through ""Horrible Bosses"" a much better movie. But that movie had a much bigger cast too and a larger chance for unexpected invention. This is little more than a bad on-the-road film -- ""Midnight Run"" without the laughs and with a musical score so painfully obvious you almost think its ironic. Its not though. The whole things not much of anything really -- just a little more than an hour-and-a-half of crude jokes and clumsy plotting all wrapped up with a feel-good ribbon at the end. There may be an identity thief at work all right. But he started off by robbing this film. Ratings note The film contains sexual situations strong language drug and alcohol abuse and violence.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Feb. 08 2013 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Feb. 08 2013 1157AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Seth Gordon Written by Craig Mazin Starring Jason Bateman and Melissa McCarthy Classification 14A Genre comedy Year 2013 Country USA Language English Theres a moment in Identity Thief an otherwise ordinary studio comedy when the extraordinary happens. The moment itself isnt unusual - merely that inevitable point when the comic star Melissa McCarthy in this case has to shed her schtick just long enough to inject the antic proceedings with a dose of quiet poignancy. Typically the sincere bit is tossed off and its right back to uproar again yet not here. McCarthy digs deeply into these precious seconds and surfaces with something altogether remarkable - suddenly were watching a different movie. But more about that later. Screen grab from a trailer for the film ""Identity Thief"" Movies Identity Thief The official trailer Lets start with the movie were mainly watching essentially a road flick that riffs off PlanesTrains amp; Automobiles - the sober straight-man travelling with his chubby lively companion who teaches him to loosen up and fly right. Sandy (Jason Bateman) is a mild-mannered paper-pusher living in Denver with his wife and two kids. Way off in Florida Diana (McCarthy) swipes his identity forges a wallet-full of credit cards and heads out on a shopping spree - booze for the whole bar makeup by the truck load a car she will use Jet Skis she wont. Its consumerism run riot binge-spending by a binge-eater purchasing power hyper-inflated in a fun-house mirror.And who better than the McCarthy persona to embody such unharnessed unhealthy freedom - the super-sized white American woman large and largely confident. (From Queen Latifah to Oprah the super-sized black American woman is differently imposing and not confined to the ghetto of comedy.) But compared to Bridesmaids she gives that persona a twist here - less sexually aggressive than sexually needy and with an undertone of vulnerability. ""People like you dont have friends"" snaps a barkeep early on and McCarthy widens her eyes to register the pain then rushes back to the mall to prove him wrong. There all the sales clerks are her bosom buddies - as long as shes buying.Meanwhile back in Denver Sandy gets wind of the scam. With the cops as useless as ever and his boss threatening to can him he hatches a plan to jet out to Orlando corral Diana and return with her to clear his good name. In their initial meeting she punches him in the throat and he throttles her with a guitar - in other words under the pedestrian direction of Seth Gordon the ordinary studio comedy begins.Soon yoked together the pair hit the open road chased by a couple of gangsters and a grizzled skiptracer but no need to fret about them - theyre just fifth business added to up the zany quotient. Really this a two-hander that unfolds at two distinctly separate speeds. The low gear is the most enjoyable when Bateman and McCarthy are allowed to trade improvised barbs that are sharp but surprisingly muted. The high gear of course brings a raucous litany of runaway trucks overturned vans snakes crawling up pant legs vomit spewing onto shirts and the likes of ""Big Chuck"" inviting Big Diana for a mighty roll in the hay. Shes genuinely touched by the offer.Which brings us to the moment. Its in St. Louis the journey winding down and Diana courtesy of a kindly cosmetician subjected to a complete makeover - gone are the white-trash prints and industrial-strength eyeliner replaced by subtle hues and a simple black dress. ""You look beautiful"" Sandy says and means it. With his identity restored he wants to know hers and asks for her ""real name."" Thats when it happens.McCarthy delivers the moment of pathos in a totally different voice tears staining her puffy face as feelings awfully real and tainted in tragedy bubble up from deep within the comic persona. Its startling its wholly incongruous yet its undeniably moving. God how this woman can act and within the brief frames of that different film how we long to see the rest of it.

Photo I would be disappointed if a movie called ""Identity Thief"" wasnt a bit light-fingered with ideas and in this Jason Bateman-Melissa McCarthy action comedy there is a lot of ""Midnight Run"" a bit of ""Catch Me If You Can"" and ""Planes Trains and Automobiles."" Maybe even a glimmer of the ultimate odd-couple road movie ""The Defiant Ones."" That last one (from 1958) was about racial tolerance though This ones more about . . . what is it about? Thats the problem. ""Identity Thief"" sets up a juicy target -- the overpaid corporate tool -- then walks away from it. Bateman is Sandy Patterson. Get it? Girls name (meaning several lame jokes along these lines). We open with a slick-talking Florida woman (McCarthy) conning Sandy over the phone into giving up his Social Security number. Soon shes buying thousands of dollars worth of drinks for everyone at a bar using a credit card with his name. Sandy an office worker in Denver who is struggling to support a family on 50K a year resolves to clear his name by bringing the identity thief Diana to justice. All he has to do is go collect her himself and deliver her to authorities in Colorado. Easy. We can forgive the silly setup without which there can be no film but like many a road movie this one has a better start and finish than middle. Thanks to McCarthys considerable talents -- the similarity of the hilarious stream-of-conscious chatter she brings to this movie ""Bridesmaids"" and ""This Is 40"" makes me think she improvises her best stuff -- Diana is a surprisingly likable fraudster. A scene in a makeup store where skinny girls mock her behind her back tells us why she steals -- its the only way she can buy popularity treating everyone to drinks. And the inside of her home is sadly funny. Shes got a china closet full of porcelain cats. Shes got a table gong. Bateman doing an expert slow burn is an able straight man. Sandy has to keep Diana in his sight at all times as she keeps outsmarting him (by for instance having a vigorous sexual encounter with a fat cowboy that Sandy cant bear to watch.) She figures out that they cant board a plane together (according to her documents they have the same name and date of birth). So we must have a car trip. Round up the wacky contrivances. Funny and promising as the first act is the entire second act is pretty awful as the script chucks in one tiresome unlikely gag after another. Theres a snake attack here and a car chase there while three bounty hunters pursue Diana. These villains (Tip ""T.I."" Harris Genesis Rodriguez Robert Patrick) are never menacing or even interesting. Director Seth Gordon had a hit with Bateman in ""Horrible Bosses"" and they should have figured out what made that movie a hit Everyone hates his or her boss. Sandy reports to one of those arrogant finance guys Harold Cornish (Jon Favreau) a raging jerk who looks like Jabba the Hutt during his lounge-singer years. Cornish dismissing Sandys feeble request for a small bonus instead cuts himself a 1.2 million check while telling his underling that the weak must starve. ""Im gonna get you a copy of The Fountainhead "" says Favreau. ""Youre gonna understand why this is good for everybody."" Forget those dim bozos chasing Sandy and Diana on the road Heres your bad guy fellas. Yet Favreau disappears from the movie. Thats too bad because for a while it looks like Gordon is going to set up a fight between the underdogs and the bulldog with Sandy and Diana realizing they have a lot in common and joining forces against the greater wrong. Isnt Dianas life just a white-trash parody of banking? The suits went on a binge with the national credit card (the Feds low interest rates) on the assumption that somebody else would cover their losses. When porcelain cats and tequila shots are at stake its massive fraud; when billions are on the line its just ""moral hazard."" At least thats close enough to the truth for a movie but instead ""Identity Thief"" settles at the end for cute sentiment mutual respect and even the birth of a child all as in another odd-couple road movie ""Due Date."" ""Identity Thief"" follows the rules and as Diana tells Sandy ""You follow the rules dont you? Hows that working out for you?""

Jason Bateman plays a sweet guy whose credit cards and identity are stolen by a manic con woman played by Melissa McCarthy. Photo Bob Mahoney Universal Pictures Identity Thief review A case of fraud 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Identity Thief Comedy. Starring Melissa McCarthy and Jason Bateman. Directed by Seth Gordon. (R. 111 minutes.) Think of this as a movie review or as just a friendly warning from a like-minded individual ""Identity Thief"" looked really good from a distance. In fact it looked like it couldnt miss. Melissa McCarthy has emerged in the last two years as one of the funniest and most promising comic actresses around and the idea of matching her exuberant relentlessness with Jason Batemans long-suffering sardonicism (yes thats really a word) seemed inspired. Indeed it was inspired. It inspired financial backing an advertising campaign two estimable talents and all the moviegoers who are planning to see it this weekend. The only people it most certainly didnt inspire were Craig Mazin and Jerry Eeten who wrote the screenplay. ""Identity Thief"" is not only not funny. Its negative funny. Its short on laughs but it will disturb and annoy. What seemed like a good idea - a comedy based on the phenomenon of identity theft - turned out to be comic quicksand. McCarthy plays Diana a Florida woman who has made a life of stealing peoples identities getting fake credit cards under the stolen name and running up enormous bills. Her latest victim is a nice guy named Sandy on the other side of the country who gets an inkling something is wrong when his credit card is rejected at a gas station. His second clue comes when the cops arrest him for having been drunk and disorderly in Florida. Hes in Denver. If youve followed along this far you might already be able to diagnose the movies fatal flaw The concept of one person stealing anothers identity might be amusing in the abstract but the minute you start filling in the details it becomes the stuff of drama not comedy. This is especially the case in ""Identity Thief"" in which Sandy (Bateman) is a sweet guy a hardworking family man with a third child on the way who has finally lucked into a high-paying job. But now he faces dismissal the complete destruction of his life because of an imbecile in Florida. ""Identity Thief"" is constructed believe it or not as a road movie a buddy comedy in which two seeming opposites find common ground. Sandy goes down to Florida to bring Diana back to Denver so she can explain the whole situation to his boss. That a borderline sociopath would do a favor for a complete stranger - one who clearly means her ill - is far-fetched even in the loose terms of zany comedy. Even if she wanted to leave town there is no reason she wouldnt ditch him at some point along the way. Actually ""Identity Thief"" seems to be an attempt to wed a hot topic to the structure of ""Midnight Run"" the 1988 classic starring Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin. Call it a coincidence but both films feature two antagonists on a cross-country trip. In both theyre chased by mobsters (played here by T.I. and Genesis Rodriguez) and by a bounty hunter (played here by Robert Patrick). In ""Midnight Run"" the men become better people for knowing each other whereas ""Identity Thief"" is so clumsily written that were told that that happens even though it doesnt. ""You taught me about getting what you want"" Sandy tells his nemesis ""and about confidence."" There are holes in the story you could float a blimp through and loose ends everywhere but none of that would matter if ""Identity Thief"" had a spark of joy some honest life to it. There is none. Its just an irritant and the worst kind to boot one that resorts to fake sentiment in the end like a scoundrel begging for a reprieve. Yes two or three times McCarthy through an unexpected reading of a weak line can coax a laugh - shes that talented - and Bateman is true to his role which is to be a dramatic character facing personal tragedy who just happens to be stuck in a supposed comedy. But thats the best that can be said for ""Identity Thief"" and even thats not much. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

"Review Laughs stolen in Identity Thief - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowReview Laughs stolen in Identity ThiefThe script for this revenge/road trip farce is a mess but Melissa McCarthy is a gem and Jason Bateman is the perfect foil.February 07 2013|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Melissa McCarthy and Jason Bateman in ""Identity Thief."" (Bob Mahoney / Universal...)""Identity Thief"" is a larcenous bit of funny business. It probably should be locked up for its crimes and misdemeanors against moviemaking.But its stars Jason Bateman and Melissa McCarthy steal so many laughs from such improbable places that the bumps in this revenge/road trip farce can be mostly forgiven though not forgotten.Directed by Seth Gordon the film has the same R-rated tenor of his relatively horrible ""Horrible Bosses"" and his really dreary ""Four Christmases."" More problematic it has the same difficulty with the connective tissue a anything but the really funny stuff sags or is superfluous.MORE Latest movie reviews from The TimesBut the comedy itself is more finely tuned and the physical pranks are better though that may just be Bateman and McCarthy doing their thing. The central issue is a wildly out-of-control script. Sorry ""Hangover Part II"" Craig Mazin but ""Thief"" is a sprawling mess packed with too many unrealized and uninteresting characters tagging along for the ride.Many of the plot twists surrounding Sandy (Bateman) and Dianas (McCarthy) cross-country ride echo the road-trip madness of ""Midnight Run"" and ""Planes Trains and Automobiles."" That would be fine if the film could keep pace with the classics. But too often ""Identity Thief"" lacks the tight calibration that kept you laughing and anticipating the next crazy curve in those much better comedies.""Identity Thiefs"" mad dash begins in Winter Park Fla. where Diana is about to run one of her credit card scams on the wrong guy. Sandy Bigelow Patterson is a decent sort with an understanding wife (Amanda Peet) two really cute kids (real-life sisters Mary-Charles and Maggie Elizabeth Jones) and a baby on the way. Hes a mid-tier accountant with a horrible boss (Jon Favreau). Though Sandys basic M.O. is to take whatever life throws at him hes frustrated enough to make a break with the firms hotshot (John Cho).Then in a parody of one of our modern-day plagues Diana calls with an identity ""protection"" offer and the walls start tumbling down. With his credit cards maxed out criminal charges piling up and the police virtually no help Sandy decides to take matters into his own hands. In short order Dianas in handcuffs and the two ""Sandys"" are on the road to Colorado to clear the real ones name. Now the true fun of ""Identity Thief"" begins.McCarthy is such a gem with a rare ability to turn a thought into a one-woman show. Even small turns become priceless a the psycho mom in ""This Is 40"" a gastricly challenged member of the wedding in ""Bridesmaids."" The actress never fails to leave you wishing for more a shes the reason some moviegoers sit through the credits of any movie shes in hoping for outtakes. ""Identity Thief"" is the biggest sandbox yet.She takes over the entire playground in ""Thief"" throwing herself so literally into the action a scrambling out windows running down freeways colliding with oncoming cars a that its a wonder she survived.Though the actress often uses her plus size as a punch line in the movie it serves even better for her characters emotional arc. Like John Candy in ""Planes Trains and Automobiles"" Dianas the outsider looking with envy at everyone elses happily ever afters and McCarthy is masterful at telegraphing that pain.Against McCarthys extremes Bateman is the perfect foil. The actor has found a way to play the nice guy next-door without losing an edge that also makes him slightly lethal when you least expect it a except in ""Up in the Air."" As George Clooneys downsizing boss he was nonstop lethal and terrific at it. But Bateman is best in roles like this where his everyman can fight back without losing his humanity.As you might expect the time Sandy and Diana spend on the road changes them in fundamental ways. Obstacles come in the form of a hit man and woman hired to take Diana out. A bounty hunter (Robert Patrick) is also hot on their trail because shes skipped bail. The only amusing one is Big Chuck (Eric Stonestreet) a big-hearted cowboy who falls for Diana during one ill-fated pit stop that involves a bar too much alcohol and some really kinky sex.There are sweet scenes with the fam a the Jones sisters never fail to charm a but the heart of this film is on the road with Bateman and McCarthy. If not for their brilliance ""Identity Thief"" would be running on empty.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com---------------------------------------------------------Identity ThiefMPAA ratingA R for sexual content and languageRunning timeA 1 hour 47 minutesPlayingA In general release PHOTOS AND MORE VIDEO The making of Argo Les Miz and more ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz PHOTOS NC-17 movies Ratings explained MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESSeth Gordon out as Horrible Bosses 2 directorAugust 7 2013Identity Thief swipes top DVD sales spotJune 17 2013Identity Thief fails to steal critics heartsFebruary 8 2013Identity Thief will easily steal No. 1 from Side EffectsFebruary 7 2013Seth Gordon looks to return for Horrible Bosses 2July 10 2012MORE STORIES ABOUTMovies_nowNot_live_webEntertainment_not_live_webCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-identity-thief-review-20130208,0,621783.story",200,identitythief16,identitythief,latimes

At first glance the ""Identity Thief"" lineup of fearless physical performer Melissa McCarthy and rock-solid straight man Jason Bateman feels like a dream team an inspired combination of volcanic zaniness and timorous passivity that promises to alchemize into comic quicksilver. Well not so fast. ""Identity Thief"" turns out to be not so much a major drag as a minor irritant the kind of instantly forgettable nothing-burger for which the early months have become notorious. A desultory collection of slapstick gags buddy-movie cliches chase-sequence bombast and wan topical humor ""Identity Thief"" is soon destined to play on an airplane screen near you the better to elicit one or two bemused glances in between checking the in-flight route map and ordering that second ginger ale. Things get off to a sluggish inattentive start when Batemans character a bank manager named Sandy Patterson receives a telephone call from a cheerful financial security operator who persuades him to give her his Social Security number. Within a few hours this flame-haired generously built unrepentantly amoral con artist is buying tequila shots for dozens of bar patrons in Winter Park Fla. on her way to racking up 12000 in credit card debt all in Sandys name. Through negotiations too convoluted and preposterous to divulge the real Sandy eventually sets off to Florida to find the fake Sandy a junket that turns into a ""Midnight Run""-type chase from all manner of petty criminals bounty hunters cops and corporate bosses. Sharing the same road-trip DNA as the similarly misbegotten ""The Guilt Trip"" ""Identity Thief"" confects as many opportunities as possible to exploit McCarthys well-padded figure from having her belly flop on to a cold hard floor engage in a sweaty one-night stand with a good ol boy played by Eric Stonestreet and make feeble passes at Batemans befuddled Sandy who makes his revulsion clear in deadpan glances worthy of Jack Lemmon. ""Identity Thief"" seeks to balance the near-constant stream of cruelty with a last-ditch attempt at humanizing McCarthys character giving her a physical and emotional make-over that true to the films ethos doesnt last long. (For those keeping lists at home the film was written by Craig Mazin who wrote ""The Hangover II"" and directed by Seth Gordon.) Soon enough shes back to her old tricks -- slugging people in the throat and getting Tasered for her trouble. McCarthys willingness to go to the mat notwithstanding its viewers who are likely left feeling punched in the gut.Contains sexual content and profanity.

Scott Bowles USA TODAY 250 p.m. EST February 8 2013Melissa McCarthy has become a modern-day John Candy and has found her wheelhouse in this Planes Trains and Automobiles lightMelissa McCarthy is the titular Identity Thief and Jason Bateman her hapless victim.(Photo Bob Mahoney Universal Pictures)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review 1/2 out of fourStars Melissa McCarthy Jason Bateman Eric Stonestreet Jonathan BanksRated R; Runtime 1 hour 47 minutes; Opens Friday nationwide 131 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 17 COMMENTEMAILMOREWhen director Seth Gordon began his search for the scoundrel to anchor his comedy Identity Thief (1/2 out of four; Rated R 1 hr. 47 min. opens nationwide Friday) he wanted a man in the starring role.Then he caught the premiere of Bridesmaids and decided to give Melissa McCarthy top billing.Thank goodness for Gordons viewing tastes.Preposterous goofy and a clear ripoff of Planes Trains and Automobiles Identity still manages to make off with just enough laughs to work thanks to the wondrous McCarthy one of the few actresses in Hollywood allowed to showcase her wit and charisma as much as her physique.Shes at her comedic top here exercising more range than she did even in the terrific Bridesmaids.And while Identity couldnt hold a veil to Bridesmaids McCarthy steals and uplifts every scene she gets in Identity the story of a woman who lives high on the hog and credit of a ninny (Jason Bateman) who offers his Social Security number faster than a handshake.Batemans character is so naive as to nearly derail this sweet comedy but McCarthy has become a modern-day John Candy a soul too good-spirited not to steal your heart split your sides and occasionally bring a lump to your throat.Sandy Bigelow Patterson (Bateman) is an everyday Pat a guy with an androgynous name a dead-end job and a growing family.The movie does a nifty job of capturing modern-day perils having a job that could be done by an app a savings account that doesnt save much and a boss that could use a good kick in the slats.And the comedy captures nicely the paralyzing violation of having your identity stolen as Diana (McCarthy) a Florida scammer turns Sandys personal information into her personal bank account running up bar tabs and helping herself to a couple of toaster ovens.Identity doesnt know when to stop though as we watch Diana score item after item including a custom-painted Fiat 500 as Sandy goes on his oblivious way through his 50000-a-year job as an executive paper pusher.Hes eventually cuffed and arrested when Diana skips bail using Sandys ID. The cops of course are no help and tell Sandy his only hope is to become his own bounty hunter.Its too easy a set-up for the road trip that follows and hews way too closely to John Hughes brilliant Planes the 1987 gem with Steve Martin and Candy. As in that film our duo cant find a way home except in a dilapidated car.And the movie piles a lot more into its 107-minute tale than Planes did including another fugitive hunter (Robert Patrick) and a couple of killers (T.I. and Genesis Rodriguez) working at the behest of a third killer (Breaking Bads Jonathan Banks). The film doesnt need that many characters particularly with McCarthy as her own one-woman show.Bateman is solid as always though his range remains limited from deadpan to slack-jawed. Modern Familys Eric Stonestreet has a nice role as Big Chuck a hayseed whose persona is larger than his confidence.But this is McCarthys film beginning to end. And like Candy shes showing range far beyond slapstick and physical humor. Theres no mistaking the genius of this actress. 131 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 17 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/VFsV8f,http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/02/07/review-of-identity-theft/1897775/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+UsatodaycomMovies-TopStories+%28Life+-+Movies+-+Top+Stories%29&utm_content=Google+Reader,200,identitythief18,identitythief,usatoday

It should also face charges for misusing the abilities of the very talented Melissa McCarthy and Jason Bateman who valiantly attempt to elevate this thoroughly dull road-trip comedy only to be undercut at every turn by Craig Mazins dreary script and the pedestrian direction by Seth Gordon (""Horrible Bosses"" ""Four Christmases""). Its a premise that offers at least some promise Financial analyst and middle manager Sandy Patterson (Bateman) has his identity stolen by professional con artist Diana (McCarthy) who takes advantage of the fact that Sandy has what everyone in the film calls a ""girls name."" (Its a gag thats mildly funny once but the movie turns to it again and again with increasing desperation.) The movies cuckoo-land logic demands that Sandy travel from Colorado to Florida to force Diana to come back with him and confess to her crimes leading to a laborious road trip in which they are chased by a bounty hunter (Robert Patrick) and two gun-toting criminals (Genesis Rodriguez and rapper T.I.) all of whom are pursuing Diana for reasons that are barely explained. Along the way of course Sandy and Diana go from being adversaries to buddies with Diana breaking down at various points to sob over the fact that her life of crime is merely a band-aid for her abandonment issues and lack of friends. Its in these boo-hoo moments that ""Identity Thief"" does the most damage to McCarthy; if this role were being played by say Will Ferrell or Jim Carrey or Vince Vaughn or Zach Galifianakis we might get one moment where the con artist drops his guard and confesses his weaknesses. McCarthy is stuck with having to do it every 20 minutes or so. Thats a real shame because McCarthy brings a truly manic go-for-broke sensibility to this sketched-in character plunging fearlessly into outrageous physical comedy (at one point Bateman subdues her by hitting her in the face with a guitar) and clownish style choices like blue eye shadow and wild hair styling. Every time she tries to rocket this sluggish story into orbit however McCarthy has to have another crying jag about her sad life and everything falls apart. Bateman for his part tries to inject whatever life he can into the straight-man half of this comedic duo but its yet another film where his gifts are squandered. With ""Arrested Development"" this journeyman actor finally found a perfect TV role but the big screen has been less kind; no one with his skills should be dragging around a resume that includes ""The Switch"" ""The Change-Up"" ""Extract"" and ""Couples Retreat"" over the course of just a few years. ""Identity Thief"" has the kind of cast that makes audiences ask ""How bad could it be?"" before proceeding to answer that very question. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe Review Identity Thief The Wrath of Con Jason Bateman and Melissa McCarthy play victim and thief in a mean-spirited road-trip comedy By Mary Pols MaryPolsFeb. 07 2013 Share Read Later Bob Mahoney / Universal Pictures Identity Thief Year 2013 Director Seth Gordon Studio Universal Pictures Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture In director Seth Gordons Identity Thief Jason Bateman plays a mild-mannered accountant who falls prey to a skilled con artist (Melissa McCarthy). This Diana-assuming-thats-even-her-real-name threatens to destroy the good name of Sandy Bigelow Patterson by ruining his credit and putting the police on his tail. She imperils his job/livelihood and indirectly his life by bringing down upon his heads -- real and fake -- the wrath of a drug lord and a bounty hunter. To save himself Sandy must find Diana in Florida and bring her to Denver both for prosecution and to prove to his boss (John Cho) that hes not a deadbeat. This often very mean-spirited movie about modern rage plays out with nods to several road-trip classics. Craig Mazin laces his screenplay with references to films like It Happened One Night (Diana tries to lure a ride while theyre hitchhiking) and Sullivans Travels (Sandy ends up in the shoes of a homeless man). And between Batemans Martinesque smirk and McCarthys Candyesque bulk we have a boy-girl version of Planes Trains and Automobiles. Identity Thiefs best joke is how deluded Sandy is about Diana. Hes seen her mug shot shes ""Hobbit height"" he observes. ""Im going after Bilbo."" (Bateman is as ever reliably funny and better than his sour-smelling surroundings but maybe its time to stop bashing his agent. Hardly the innocent lamb led to slaughter the actor is also choosing these parts.) Sandy packs handcuffs and just in case his wifes anxiety pills and proceeds to get beaten up and robbed of his car as soon as he finds Diana. By the time he arrives at her house hes ready to do physical harm. (MORE TIME Review of Bridesmaids) Having been the victim of identity theft like countless others I understand Sandys murderous impulses. And yet watching him bludgeon Diana with a household appliance and guitar didnt feel particularly satisfying. Not that it does him any good; Diana rebounds like a jack-in-a-box. In many ways this encapsulates the experience of having ones identity stolen. You put out one fire and then find another somewhere else whether it be a box of checks the thief is busily bouncing or 3000 worth of sweatshirts and jeans charged to the Gap. (Yeah Im still angry.) And you like Sandy rarely find assistance from law enforcement. ""Our percentage of solving these cases is pretty high"" a detective (Morris Chestnut) tells him. ""Five to 10 percent."" Despite how invigorating it may be to see a victim take matters into his own hands Diana is not a real identity thief. Shes a Hollywood construct complete with a sob story shared late in the game that is meant to justify her crimes and turn her into a sympathetic character. Its sleazy storytelling. Yet the movie screws with your head until you start to think its a good thing. Heres McCarthy last year an Oscar nominee throwing herself into the business of making fat-and-friendless jokes -- shes such a trooper that you want something better for her. And youre sucked into wanting Sandy and Diana to start bonding to become pals and do the inevitable teaching-each-other-lessons bit if only to liberate this extraordinarily likable actress from such a gross and venal role. She must learn to be more decent (sort of). And he having started this whole thing by foolishly giving out his personal information on the phone has to be less of a trusting sucker. Identity Thief reflects a common pattern in contemporary comedies issuing invitations to hate loath and detest characters (in Gordons last movie Horrible Bosses also starring Bateman Jennifer Aniston played a pig) then demanding that we come around to affection. These films open a pressure valve for the moviegoers who feel damaged by the world asking us to live vicariously through people assaulting each other before telling us to buck up and be cheerful at the end. This is not Zen. This is today. It is now. (MORE TIME Review of Horrible Bosses) Is it O.K. to still point out that Identity Thief is disturbing? In one scene Diana has rough sex with a potential mark (Eric Stonestreet) she meets in a bar. Their interaction veers between the nastily comic -- ""Hey look at the big people having sex"" -- and the sad since both are lonely and were told intimacy is rare for them. But theres also an undercurrent of punishment. Not rape but something in that general ballpark of misogyny. (This is a movie in which the worst insult hurled at a man is that hes a ""vagina."" Theres a feminist essay in there somewhere especially since it is Diana who employs the word.) The morning after Diana is in pain complaining to Sandy that her date might have torn something. Across Batemans pleasantly bland features flickers a look that suggests Sandy is not displeased to think of Dianas womanhood being damaged. Its just a movie with a dramatic arc thats supposed to make all that mean stuff drift away into the ether as friendship is born but its that look that hangs around like a bad smell.

You should also know that the madness of Big Pharma peddling psychoactive meds on a staggering scale is only the starting point of a plot that pushes the principle of nothing being what it seems. In another sense though everything is exactly what it seems expertly crafted and cleverly compounded for high-dose entertainment. Watch a clip from the film ""Side Effects."" Emily (Rooney Mara) and Martin (Channing Tatum) are a couple whose world unravels when a new drug prescribed by Emilys psychiatrist (Jude Law) has unexpected side effects. (Photo/Video Open Road Films) The stars are Rooney Mara and Jude Law. Shes Emily Taylor a victim of chronic depression with darting eyes and a haunted demeanor. Hes Dr. Jonathan Banks Emilys manifestly empathetic psychiatrist. Channing Tatum is Emilys husband Martin but we dont see much of him given that Martin is out looking for work after serving a prison term for insider trading. At first ""Side Effects"" which was written by Scott Z. Burns slides back and forth ever so smoothly between its heroines urgent need for treatment and droll observations on pill-poppery in the general population--the antidepressants with seductive names the television commercials with dire warnings of side effects couched in idiotically cheerful tones. For the most part the prescription chatter concerns such familiar brands as Effexor Wellbutrin Xanax and Zoloft--were a long way from the Soma of Aldous Huxleys ""Brave New World""--though special attention is reserved for Ablixa (""Take Back Tomorrow"") a new competitor for market share thats no less effective for being fictional. Google its name and you get a website thats all the more amusing for being bogus. When Emilys mood--and more significantly her behavior--takes a startling turn for the worse the story turns toward issues of responsibility for criminal acts. Much of this is fascinating in the abstract. Can criminal intent be proved for example in a person who commits a crime while sleepwalking as the result of medication? Can a portion of guilt be shared by the shrink who prescribed the pills? Then theres the concrete question of whos certifiable in the area of venality. (A larger proportion of the movies population than you might think.) A few developments test credulitys tensile strength; theyre like a collection of especially convoluted outtakes from ""Law amp; Order."" Yet the film as a whole is consistently enjoyable and sometimes thrilling a classic Soderbergh showcase for provocative storytelling and marvelous acting. Mr. Laws performance gains straight-line intensity as his character grows ever more desperate. Instead of a parody of a crazy psychiatrist the actor gives us a plausible portrait of a caregiver afflicted by professional ambition financial stress congenital malevolence and undiagnosed naivete. Catherine Zeta-Jones does cool-to-chilling variations on a similar theme; shes Dr. Victoria Siebert a psychotherapist who has treated Emily in the past. But the breakthrough belongs to Ms. Mara however odd that term may seem for an actress who got our attention with a single scene at the start of ""The Social Network"" then played the title role in David Finchers English-language version of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo."" I found that starring performance fairly conventional and not very interesting. This time though with supple direction and a character of exceptional variety Ms. Rooney is impressive in her range and commendable for her subtlety whether Emily is struggling to find her emotional core or having found it is coping with the unintended consequences of her cure. Supple is only one word for the directors technique. In previous films his work has been stylish puckish precise reserved distant or the hardest of all qualities to achieve invisible--conveying the illusion of a film unfolding spontaneously. Ever since Mr. Soderbergh unveiled his virtuosity almost a quarter-century ago with ""Sex Lies and Videotape"" he has turned out an extraordinary assortment of mainstream hits (""Erin Brockovich"" ""Oceans Eleven""); eccentric experiments (""Kafka"" Schizopolis""); handsome failures (""The Good German""); and small-scale treasures (""Out of Sight""). Often serving as his own cinematographer--under the well-known pseudonym of Peter Andrews--he has been an auteur without portfolio; each production has given us something new to chew over or delight in. If this is the last Soderbergh film for the big screen as the filmmaker has been saying it is in recent interviews the movie medium will be much poorer for it. Watch a clip from the film ""Identity Thief."" Businessman Sandy (Jason Bateman) travels to confront the deceptively harmless-looking woman (Melissa McCarthy) who has been living it up after stealing Sandys identity. (Photo/Video Universal) ENLARGE Melissa McCarthy Universal Pictures Identity Thief Melissa McCarthy stole big chunks of a great show in the 2011 ""Bridesmaids"" She was Megan the bridesmaid of formidable girth and unstoppable id. On the strength of that sensational comic turn she clearly deserved her own starring vehicle. But no one--neither the star nor her audience--deserves ""Identity Thief"" the comedy equivalent of mud-wrestling without the mud. Its premise is simple and obtuse. Jason Batemans earnest businessman Sandy Patterson must travel from his home in Colorado to Florida to confront Ms. McCarthys faux Sandy Patterson an electronic kleptomaniac who has ruined his life by stealing his identity then bring her back home to confess to her crimes. And why would he embark on such an unlikely quest? Because in the terms of Craig Mazins coarse script its the way to turn a schematic sitcom notion into a raunchy road movie. (The director was Seth Gordon.) ""More is not more"" says a scandalized stylist in a salon where Ms. McCarthys Sandy is gorging on beauty products. Truer words were never spoken or more flagrantly ignored. The organizing principle of this shambles is Pile It On--pile on the crotch jokes car chases car crashes hot pursuits torrid sex and literal snakes in the literal grass. Mr. Bateman I am happy to report does not participate in the movies sexual low jinks. As Ms. McCarthys straight man he mostly looks distressed or dismayed. Ms. McCarthy on the other hand participates in everything but restraint. The sad thing is that her devouring character could have been a genuine phenomenon instead of what the movie makes her a grotesque kewpie doll with fluffed-up hair shallow dimples and dead eyes. Watch the trailer if you must but spare yourself the full experience ""Identity Thief"" steals time. --J.M. Watch a clip from the film ""Lore.""

That promising debut feature was the story of an Australian girls self-abasement that leads via dangerous detours to self-discovery and Abbie Cornish gave a remarkable performance in the title role. Now in Ms. Shortlands second feature the promise is amply even startlingly fulfilled. ""Lore"" is a complex tale in German with English subtitles told from the perspective of five German siblings in the spring of 1945 when Hitlers forces have collapsed in the face of the Allied invasion. This is another coming-of-age story but one that stakes out new territory. The first clue to its intricacy comes when the oldest child Lore ( Saskia Rosendahl) asks her mother for reassurance that Germanys ""final victory"" is still within grasp. Hitler is dead says the mother bereft ""This is the end."" For 14-year-old Lore however its a beginning. After her Nazi parents go off to prison she must care for her brothers and sister in a terrifying world where Americans are viewed as the enemy as well as the source of vile lies about German atrocities visited on Jews. Again as in ""Somersault"" the narrative structure is an odyssey of body and soul. The physical aspects are harrowing. Searching for safety Lore takes her truncated family from the Black Forest of Bavaria across a devastated land to the outskirts of Hamburg where the childrens grandmother lives in a house whose walls Lore remembers are decorated with little windmills. The spiritual journey is equally intense. It brings almost unbearable bewilderment in the form of a young Jewish man Thomas ( Kai Malina) a concentration-camp escapee who may be heaven-sent and the childrens savior or as Lore fears diabolical and their undoing. And again a young actress shines in the title role. Lore--short for Hannalore--is seized by fear and loathing of Thomas whos not much older than she is but also by sexual desire. All of this plays out with unforced eloquence on Ms. Rosendahls lovely face accompanied by flashes of rage at the responsibilities that keep threatening to overwhelm the heroine a girl suddenly thrust into a kind of motherhood. Ms. Shortlands film based on a novel by Rachel Seiffert was adapted for the screen by the director and Robin Mukherjee. The pace is deliberate verging on slow--Australian filmmakers arent keen on short takes or quick cuts--but the content is constantly surprising. Lore does somersaults too as the ground crumbles beneath her feet and her beliefs are turned on their heads. --J.M. --Email Joe at joe.morgensternwsj.com and follow him on Twitter JoeMorgenstern. DVD Focus Where to begin sampling the variety of Steven Soderberghs feature output? Here are three good entry points ENLARGE Erin Brockovich Erin Brockovich (2000) The embodiment of brains and heart this terrific comedy has a starring performance by Julia Roberts thats as funny romantic and justifiably self-confident as any seen on the screen since Hollywoods golden age. In theme it resembles other truish life stories about working women taking on corporate adversaries such films as ""Silkwood"" or ""Norma Rae."" But its mercifully free of the genres worst cliches--no didacticism bombast or courtroom scenes--and it celebrates a single mother whose star power lies in her God-given intelligence and sexuality. The script was written by Susannah Grant with uncredited contributions by Richard LaGravenese. ENLARGE The Limey The Limey (1999) Terence Stamp is Wilson a white-haired English ex-con who shows up in Los Angeles to avenge his daughters death. Its a shock to see him played by Mr. Stamp who looked like a young blond angel when he made his debut as the title character in a 1962 screen adaptation of Herman Melvilles ""Billy Budd."" Then comes another shock in flashbacks to Wilsons young manhood. Instead of youthening its star with makeup ""The Limey"" ingeniously uses footage from Mr. Stamp acting in another film Ken Loachs 1967 ""Poor Cow."" ENLARGE King of the Hill King of the Hill (1993) Long unavailable on DVD Mr. Soderberghs superb third feature can finally be seen as streaming video on Netflix. An almost perfect coming-of-age film its based on A.E. Hotchners memoir of his life as a child during the Depression. Jesse Bradford is the authors surrogate Aaron whos left to fend for himself in a rundown hotel in the Midwest after hes separated from his parents and younger brother. The cast includes Jeroen Krabbe Lisa Eichorn Karen Allen Spalding Gray Elizabeth McGovern and Adrien Brody. The production which abounds in period details was designed by Gary Frutkoff. --J.M.

The setup Sandy Patterson who works in a Denver financial firm (and is not supposed to be mentally challenged) blithely hands over his Social Security number to a stranger on the phone who says his accounts have been compromised at which point his accounts get compromised. No tricks no subterfuge no laughs -- hes just stupid. The follow-up Sandy flies to Florida to persuade the identity thief to accompany him home where hell hand her over to police. He brings handcuffs in case shes uncooperative. No tricks no subterfuge no laughs -- he just thinks shes stupid. The star Melissa McCarthy who plays the title character -- and who absolutely deserves a star vehicle after stealing Bridesmaids from her better-known co-stars -- gets saddled with a script that subverts her gift for verbal improv by requiring her to throat-punch all comers just as conversations get started and undercuts her comic timing with overstaged sequences in which she gets tackled slammed pinned violated abused busted in the chops with a guitar beaned with household appliances and rammed full-throttle by a car. The co-star Jason Bateman whose deft way with sarcasm turned Arrested Development into must-see TV is relegated to playing a clueless sappily sentimental chump. The villain Terminator 2s relentless stop-at-nothing T-1000 Robert Patrick gets a part so precisely up his alley -- a relentless stop-at-nothing bounty hunter -- it has to have been intended as a joke. But the joke gets shortchanged because in a beard and a plaid shirt hes scruffily unrecognizable. (Not to mention easily sidetracked by comparison with two thugs who are gratuitously tracking the title character.) i McCarthy is manic vulgar and largely wasted in Seth Gordons lame comedy. Universal Pictures hide caption toggle caption Universal Pictures McCarthy is manic vulgar and largely wasted in Seth Gordons lame comedy. Universal Pictures The rest Rapper T.I. -- one of those thugs shot and stuffed in a trunk (possibly for trying to imbue his lines with a bit of personality). Raven-haired beauty Genesis Rodriguez -- his thug-ette partner shot and stuffed in a trunk (possibly for not protesting when makeup artists made her look tough and plain). Harold and Kumars John Cho -- inexplicably cast as a straight-arrow banking exec who doesnt so much as blink when his offices are searched for drugs. Jon Favreau -- amusing as a boss from hell for maybe 90 seconds at the top of the picture and then gone for the duration. The concept Stealing someones identity while no doubt ghastly for victims can be a comic goldmine in the right storytelling hands. Think Monty Pythons Life of Brian Chaplins The Great Dictator the Coen Brothers The Big Lebowski -- and onstage everything from Charleys Aunt to The Comedy of Errors. Electronic identity theft offers a host of new possibilities and to have almost none of them explored by writer Craig Mazin and director Seth Gordon in this uninspired trudge of a road movie is the biggest waste of all.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A mild-mannered accounts rep tries to take his life back from an obnoxious scam artist. Rated R (sexual content and language) BOTTOM LINE Its hit and miss and a little heavy on the hefty jokes but McCarthy turns this comedy into a winner with a smart funny and surprisingly touching performance. CAST Jason Bateman Melissa McCarthy Robert Patrick LENGTH 147 ""Identity Thief"" a comedy starring Melissa McCarthy as a Florida scam artist named Diana isnt always funny. Diana a self-loathing liar steals peoples lives and then fills her own with food shopping sprees and alcohol. The hundreds of people drinking on her dime are not her friends a bartender informs her. ""People like you dont have friends."" The darkness in this comedy is exactly what makes it work so well. McCarthy poised to become the new John Belushi after playing the flagrantly flatulent Megan in ""Bridesmaids"" here emerges as something closer to John Candy -- an extra-large talent whose heart matches her size. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Comedy Central upset over use of fake Colbert? Thats partly because ""Identity Thief"" is essentially a coarser cruder update of Candys ""Planes Trains and Automobiles"" with Jason Bateman replacing Steve Martin as an uptight Denver accountant named Sandy Patterson. After Diana wrecks Sandys credit and jeopardizes his job (John Cho plays his unsympathetic boss) he decides to bring her to justice himself. Writer Craig Mazin (""The Hangover Part II"") and director Seth Gordon (""Horrible Bosses"") keep things loose which is a nice way of saying the gags are hit-and-miss. Diana picks up a sexually adventurous admirer (Eric Stonestreet) Sandy finds a snake in his pants and various hoodlums are played by Robert Patrick Genesis Rodriguez and the rapper Tip ""T.I."" Harris. Gluing the whole mess together though are Bateman and McCarthy. Riffing razzing each other and frequently playing rough they make a sparkling comic team. The jokes sometimes feel mean -- eewww heavy people having sex -- but McCarthy somehow always retains her dignity. Her best scene in which Diana shyly dons a flattering dress and joins Sandy for a fancy dinner is downright moving. ""Identity Thief"" certainly has its flaws but McCarthy gives it a winning personality. 219 VideoTrailer Identity Thief PLOT A mild-mannered accounts rep tries to take his life back from an obnoxious scam artist.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint I was about to describe the Jason Bateman/Melissa McCarthy vehicle ""Identity Thief"" as a dismal new comedy but thats not accurate. There is not a premise character situation or theme in this crass film that is in any way new. At best its perversely interesting as a major misstep for both stars. Hes Sandy Patterson a Denver corporate accountant and shes Diana a free-spending Florida scam artist who steals his personal information and trashes his credit rating overnight. With his reputation and job dangling by a thread he heads cross-country to confront her. With not one but three vengeful pursuers closing in on her she has little choice but to buddy up with her buttoned-down victim. Hilarity does not for an instant ensue. You can see why they hoped it would. McCarthy got a deserved Oscar nomination for her energetic work in ""Bridesmaids"" and Bateman is a wily underplayer. In a better production their contradictory comic styles might strike sparks. Here they nullify each other. Playing a contrived concept rather than a character McCarthy is all huge flailing gestures and silly mugging faces. Bateman phones it in lobbing an occasional incredulous reaction shot as his co-star lies cons seduces and hoodwinks every chump who crosses her path. As downtrodden nice guy Sandy faces off against harmless-looking but wily Diana each learns Important Life Lessons from the other. Stand up for yourself But be nice too After about 80 minutes of strenuous huffing and puffing we shift gears to pathos as McCarthy shows the clowns sensitive side. The cause of her grudge against humanity is all too blandly sentimental for its own good. The script by Craig Mazin (of the ""Hangover"" and ""Scary Movie"" series) is a tortured exercise in high-concept hokum one set piece barely linked to the next. Identity thief 0 out of 4 stars Rating R for sexual content and language. Director Seth Gordon (""Horrible Bosses"") compounds the implausibility spelling out every plot point as if the movie were an episde of ""Sesame Street."" Suck the surprise subtext and nuance out of comedy and all youve got left is slapstick. Not that even physical humor is well served here. The film uses McCarthy and Bateman as Three Stooges-type punching bags. She throat-chops him. He prangs her in the face with a guitar. I imagine they were each thinking of their agents for motivation. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

"Thief  steals Melissa McCarthys thunder - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate Thief  steals Melissa McCarthys thunder Share Tweet This is a test player. Share Tweet By Ty Burr Globe Staff | 02.07.13 | 411 PM All that good will Melissa McCarthy had after ""Bridesmaids""? Completely undone by ""Identity Thief"" an obnoxious comedy made worse by obnoxious sentimentality. Unfunny predictable and vulgar its the generic equivalent of a Judd Apatow movie. As always you get what you pay for. Unless of course fat ladies rubbing their crotches and braying like mules is your idea of comedy gold in which case heres your swill of the week. Jason Bateman trying manfully to hold on to his dignity plays Sandy Patterson a Denver corporate drone with a pregnant wife (Amanda Peet) and two little girls (sisters Mary-Charles and Maggie Elizabeth Jones). Mr. Average in other words. McCarthy is Diana a cheerful sociopath who smooth-talks Sandy out of his credit information over the phone and goes on a Florida shopping spree that ends up with the cops at her victims door. Related Link Find showtimes and theaters The few laughs come early via Dianas infectious shopaholic glee; few people in the movies enjoy themselves as enjoyably as McCarthy. Then the script by Craig Mazin and Jerry Eeten tortures itself in an effort to get Sandy and Diana together and on a road trip back to Denver where he can turn her over to the law and convince his boss (John Cho) of his innocence. No it doesnt make sense. Nothing in this movie makes sense. Next to ""Identity Thief"" ""Inception"" is a marvel of sober concision. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below On the couples trail are a psychotic debt collector (Robert Patrick looking like a methed-out Kris Kristofferson) and two sharply dressed members of a drug cartel (Genesis Rodriguez and rapper T.I.) who want Diana dead for reasons even the screenwriters cant figure out. Director Seth Gordon -- who had a promising little career making documentaries like ""The King of Kong"" before going Hollywood with dreck like ""Horrible Bosses"" -- puts more energy into the car chases than anything that passes for recognizable human behavior. At 108 minutes ""Identity Thief"" goes on forever and you start ticking off the comedy cliches and story beats to keep tedium at bay Scene where McCarthy sings badly to 70s oldies on the car radio check. Scene where Bateman loses his pants check. Scene where McCarthy sees a picture of Batemans kids and goes all gooey sigh. And obligatory fat-guy butt cheeks obviously. In what youd think would be the low point of ""Identity Thief"" Diana invites a portly gent named Big Chuck (Eric Stonestreet) back to a motel room for a furniture-wrecking bout of kinky sex while Sandy cowers in the bathroom. If the filmmakers really wanted to push the envelope theyd throw Sandy and Diana into bed together but that might scare the paying customers. The movies general attitude toward large people is that theyre just regular folks once youre done making fun of them. Actually the rock-bottom nadir of ""Identity Thief"" would have to be the scenes that try to gin up sympathy for Diana a weepy monologue about her foster-home upbringing and a late-inning makeover that gives the character a ""sensible"" hairdo and a tasteful black dress. Its like putting a circus clown in a chador -- whats the point? As a comedy star McCarthy lives by aggression and the belief that shes the hottest thing on the planet. Her obliviousness empowers her; thats the joke and shes in on it. In ""Identity Thief"" the jokes on her and everyone comes out a loser. Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday February 7 2013 153 PM Title Identity Thief Film Info R Sex language violence. Area theaters. In 2007 Seth Gordon made the fantastic documentary ""The King of Kong."" Hes directed episodes of TV shows like ""Parks and Recreation"" ""Community"" and ""Modern Family."" He helmed the 2011 hit ""Horrible Bosses."" And now he gives us the painfully flat ""Identity Thief."" Is it possible he pitched the project lined up the stars and then somebody else snuck in to make the movie? Jason Bateman is a stellar straight man and Melissa McCarthy still hasnt found the limits of her comic range. Pair them up with a timely potentially perfect idea and you should have an instant triumph. Alas neither Craig Mazins script nor Gordons direction is nearly as deft as McCarthys malleable grifter Diana. She finds the ideal mark in Batemans Sandy a good guy entirely lacking in cynicism -- or access to the news apparently since he willingly offers his Social Security number to Diana when she calls posing as a credit rep. Soon enough Sandys name is on Dianas credit cards drivers license and growing rap sheet. When a detective (Morris Chestnut) arrests him and his boss (John Cho) threatens to fire him Sandy leaves his pregnant wife (Amanda Peet) and heads to Florida. His naive plan is to track Diana down bring her back to Denver and clear the whole mess up. The ensuing road trip should be hilariously chaotic a classic misadventure between two ill-matched travelers. Instead of ""Midnight Run"" though we get another gloss on the recent ""Guilt Trip"" in which the concept is all that counts. Despite so much anarchic potential the filmmakers rely on easy scenarios that culminate in pat cliches or unfunny jokes (a soft-focus makeover for Diana constant digs about Sandys ""gender neutral"" name). What success the movie finds is due to the leads efforts which are impressively strenuous. They start out with a great premise and theyre clearly ready to run with it. But most of the laughs are stolen right out from under them. On mobile?

By Barbara VanDenburgh The Republic | azcentral.com Fri Feb 8 2013 1245 PM Melissa McCarthy deserves better than a guitar to the face. She deserves better than getting hit by a car. She deserves better than puke gags and fat jokes. And she definitely deserves better than having her considerable comedic chops squandered in a movie as lazily slapped together as ""Identity Thief."" Jason Bateman also deserves better than Sandy Patterson a family man whose identity he discovers has been stolen when the attendant maxed out credit cards and arrest warrants start closing in on him. The timing couldnt be worse as his wife (Amanda Peet) is pregnant with their third child and hes just starting out in a high-profile position at a new job. Of course if everyone were rational and chill about the situation wed never get a scene where a CGI snake wraps itself around a pantsless Batemans neck. So instead the police kvetch that their hands are tied by state lines (hes in Colorado the monkey business is in Florida) and Pattersons boss frets that their clients will be spooked and he might have to fire him. Somehow all of these adults with degrees and jobs and families and a handful of brain cells to rub together come to the conclusion that the wisest course of action is for Patterson to personally travel to Florida and drag his identity thief back to Colorado. So Patterson kisses his far-too-understanding wife goodbye and sets off to find the impostor Sandy Patterson and haul her back to explain things to his boss and the local authorities. Who he finds is Diana (McCarthy) a sociopathic hedonistic throat-punching goblin woman with a houseful of illicitly obtained goods and a wallet full of credit cards with his name on it. What follows is part odd-couple road-trip comedy part heist flick part feel-good drama all jammed uncomfortably together like puzzle pieces that dont quite fit. And at nearly two hours it becomes clear just how hard a time the scriptwriters had finding their way. Why is a grizzled old dude chasing after them in a van and trying to kidnap Diana? Why does rapper T.I. keep showing up with a gun and miserable line delivery? Why on Earth does McCarthy keep singing the verse ""My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard""? Why wont this just end already? The films few chuckles can be chalked up to the sheer comedic charisma of McCarthy and Bateman. McCarthy proves herself an adept physical actress handling slapstick pratfalls like a long lost Stooge while Bateman further hones his frazzled type-A shtick. Both elevate the lowly material through expert delivery but not enough to make this movie work. Everyone would have been better off if the editors had just cobbled together a 90-minute blooper reel and called it a day.

HOEP This undated publicity image released by Universal Pictures shows Jason Bateman left and Melissa McCarthy in a scene from ""Identity Thief."" (AP Photo/Universal Pictures) HOEP Jason Bateman right and Melissa McCarthy in a scene from ""Identity Thief."" (AP Photo/Universal Pictures) HOEP Melissa McCarthy in a scene from ""Identity Thief."" (AP Photo/Universal Pictures) Its an occupational hazard. The phone in my bohemian garret will ring and an unfamiliar voice will ask if I am the film buff who ordered the Adam Sandler Blu-ray Collection the life-size ""Transformers"" action figures or the trip to the ""Showgirls"" fantasy camp in Las Vegas. So for the record if you see an ad for ""Identity Thief"" in which a reviewer calls it ""a laugh riot"" that wasnt me. Suffering through this felonious farce could only inspire a prison riot.Theres the germ of a timely idea in the story of a Denver dad and accountant named Sandy Patterson (Jason Bateman) whose identity is stolen by a Florida shopaholic (Melissa McCarthy). But that germ produces a full-blown epidemic of stupidity. When his new boss (John Cho) threatens to fire him over the bad publicity of a police raid at the office Sandy decides to track down the thief and drag her to Denver to confess. And inexplicably his pregnant wife (Amanda Peet) agrees to let him go.In an alternate universe where alert cops dont seem to exist Sandys confrontation with the woman who calls herself Diana includes kidnapping car theft and attempted murder. Even a few minutes of screen time with this larcenous harpy is like a life sentence of scraping nails on a chalkboard but the criminally implausible script ensures that Sandy and Diana are stuck with each other on a cross-country road trip. And then it adds a hot pursuit by a bounty hunter (Robert Patrick) and a pair of vengeful drug dealers (Genesis Rodriguez and the rapper T.I.) for bad measure. What ensues is a vile variation on ""Planes Trains and Automobiles"" with McCarthy shoplifting John Candys character and Bateman doing his everyman schtick on autopilot. Theres even a scene in St. Louis (impersonated by another city) where the unlikely companions pull a high-tech heist so they can afford a nice hotel room for the night. Like it did for me their visit to the Gateway City produces tears as Sandy learns that you cant judge a crook by its cover.If ""Identity Thief"" isnt the most outrageous social satire since ""Myra Breckenridge"" then my name isnt Rex Reed.

"Identity Thief movie review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Identity Thief steals fun away from Bateman McCarthy  1/2 Identity Thief Melissa McCarthy and Jason Bateman star in ""Identity Thief."" Melissa McCarthy and Jason Bateman star in ""Identity Thief."" Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Debilitatingly witless ""Identity Thief"" strands Melissa McCarthy and Jason Bateman on the shoulder of its own road-trip premise an artificial construct reminiscent of ""Due Date."" Remember ""Due Date"" that sour thing with Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis? Neither do Downey and Galifianakis.The screenwriter of ""Identity Thief"" Craig Mazin gave us ""The Hangover Part II."" All these pictures belong to the same realm of exhausted mean-spirited comedy pushing casually sadistic mayhem in the guise of slapstick destined to make millions on the backs of its actors. You cant really talk about any of these pictures in terms of their comic machinery because at heart theyre barely comedies. Theyre situations in search of comedy. All McCarthy has to do is show up and the audience likes her even when the audience is supposed to hate her or when ""Identity Thief"" treats her character -- a brazen Florida con woman living large on the Visas of others -- like a feral subhuman pathos dispenser.When Denver accounts representative Sandy Patterson played by Bateman discovers his identity has been purloined and his credit cards are maxed out trashing his good name his employer (John Cho) declares him a bad risk for their startup company. Sandy is given one week to retrieve the con woman; bring her to Denver all the while being tailed by drug dealers and a murderous bounty hunter; and turn her over to the police thereby clearing up the mess the script tries so hard to establish gracefully. Were meant to see Diana McCarthys character as a funny/sad victim of circumstance whose suburban Orlando home is stuffed with ill-gotten blenders and makeup with a Jet Ski in the front yard. Sandy her temperamental opposite is presented as a milquetoast family man (Amanda Peet plays his blandly defined wife whom we know only as someone who takes Xanax) whose backbone emerges battered but for the better during his treacherous road trip with Diana.Batemans a seriously skillful actor. But with inferior material his fallback line reading becomes the sardonic too-cool-for-the-room underreaction which isnt the same thing as ""milquetoast."" He has the air of a cynical but bored winner a man fighting his own irritation with everyone around him. Thats not quite right for the audience-identification figure at the center of ""Identity Thief.""As in ""Planes Trains and Automobiles"" the adversary we think we know at the outset (John Candy there McCarthy here) is revealed to be something different and heartbreaking by the end. How a movie gets from A to Z is the question. ""Identity Thief"" paints Florida as a snake-infested (literally; theres a scene with a snake crawling up Batemans pants) hotbed of prejudice and racism and American screen comedy as little more than people shooting other people in the cheek or the foot or someone getting smashed in the face with a guitar.Director Seth Gordon made ""Horrible Bosses"" which was actually cruder than this movie though quite funny and nicely plotted. This time Gordon is lost and his style of shooting -- telescopic close-ups which never give us enough space to appreciate the performers -- feels wrong for comedy. By the time McCarthy punches somebody in the throat for the fifth time and the inevitable Taser sight gag gets recycled ""Identity Thief"" has challenged the best abilities of everybody on-screen including Eric Stonestreet Cam on ""Modern Family"" as a barfly on the make. Crud has a way of doing that. mjphillipstribune.comIdentity Thief -- 1 1/2 starsMPAA rating R (for sexual content and language)Running time 151Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Entertainment Due Date (movie) Robert Downey Jr. John Cho Zach Galifianakis Melissa McCarthy The Hangover Part II (movie) 10 movies to see this winter Top 50 superhero movies of the last 10 years Michael Phillips predicts the Oscars Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising71deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0206-identity-thief-20130207,0,6276434.column",200,identitythief30,identitythief,chicagotribune

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Its easy to admire Identity Thiefs narrative efficiency without respecting the results. Screenwriter Craig Mazin (Scary Movie 3 and 4 The Hangover Part II and III) devotes a bare line or two of dialogue to each aspect of his plot setup Colorado finance-company flak Jason Bateman exchanges a couple of sentences with his boss (John Cho) to establish that Bateman is an efficient dedicated worker. A short scene with his wife (Amanda Peet) reveals that theyre living on a shoestring budget but holding out hope for the future. Fifteen seconds on the phone with Florida con artist Melissa McCarthy lets her steal his identity and start running up vast debts in his name; a panicked moment with an unhelpful detective (Morris Chestnut) makes it clear that interstate prosecution will take at least a year. Bateman lunges for an unlikely solution getting Chestnut and Cho to agree that if Bateman fetches McCarthy from Florida himself and procures her willing confession within one week he can clear his name before a life-changing business opportunity passes him by. Meanwhile the film gets far more expansive and self-indulgent during a long sequence where the friendless lonely but irrepressible McCarthy exploits Batemans credit line by buying thousands of dollars worth of drinks for everyone at a local bar then winds up cavorting on tables and leaping for chandeliers. Thus Identity Thief establishes its priorities Expansive character business is front and center; actual character-building is in the margins almost off the map. Thats an understandable value system for a comedy especially one that wants to rocket past the setup and straight into setpieces involving McCarthy picking up a local for headboard-banging shrieking sex or inventing a new sympathy-garnering identity for every situation. And its clear that the plot is just a nominal frame for comic business straight out of Planes Trains And Automobiles right down to the tense cross-country trip between unwilling partners the endless transportational setbacks and the classic personality clash between a fat loud crass character and a skinny prim uptight one. Like Horrible Bosses the previous feature from director Seth Gordon (who also helmed the stellar 2007 documentary The King Of Kong) Identity Thief is essentially a sloppy 80s character comedy with a sleeker 2013 editing and scripting sensibility. But for all the streamlining Identity Thief rarely hits breakneck speed thanks to its long sometimes improvised scenes of mayhem. And the frame isnt the only thing pared down to utilitarian basics The tacked-on Elmore Leonard-esque villains get short shrift too. As a grizzled Nick Nolte-like skip-tracer chasing McCarthy former Terminator Robert Patrick plays his role nearly straight-faced and in the process becomes one of the films funniest elements. But Genesis Rodriguez and rapper T.I. as a pair of murderous thugs set on McCarthys trail by Breaking Bads Jonathan Banks spend so little time onscreen they suggest an extraneous plot thread that couldnt entirely be excised. Still while Identity Thief treats everything but the scenes between Bateman and McCarthy as negligible the material it does value is reasonably satisfying. Bateman is familiar and comfortable in his turn as a put-upon ineffectual straight man and McCarthy is winning with her usual go-for-broke gameness as his brassy big-haired foil. Identity Thief has her puking pratfalling and sport-fucking but her role is still considerably less grotesque than her Bridesmaids part and in the inevitable scene where she drops her guard shes strikingly vulnerable with a conviction that proves she hasnt lost her acting chops amid the car chases and slapstick of her current career. There are two extremes to Identity Thief. On the hacky end a mild gag about Batemans characters ""girly"" name (""No actually Sandy is unisex"") is mechanically repeated over and over in the vain hope that itll become funny through repetition. On the more nuanced end Bateman learns deception and confidence from McCarthy then uses it to scam his hapless doppelganger at another branch of his company by turning his own fears of failure and inadequacy into a sophisticated weapon. Identity Thief gains some strength from that variety of humor and its fleetness leaves it plenty of time to try different things. The problem is that it gives that redundant name gag and that life-changing experience equal weight and roughly equal screen time. A comedy doesnt necessarily need to develop its characters past caricatures but a better balance between narrative and yuks tends to make the yuks stronger.

Theres more than just bravery in her willingness to go all out; theres also generosity whether its putting the moves on an air marshal in Bridesmaids downing a bottle of salad dressing on SNL or now brazenly scamming her way through life in Identity Thief. In her first starring role in a feature comedy McCarthy plays Diana a resourceful big-haired Florida grifter who leads the good life -- at least by tacky big-haired standards -- while running up a huge tab under a fake identity. And she hits a jackpot with the assets of one Sandy Bigelow Patterson a sober-minded Colorado family man. The story is about as subtle as a Florida theme park. Finding his life in shambles and tracing the destruction to her door Sandy (benefiting from a full dose of Batemans patented contained exasperation) heads south to drag Diana to justice. And thats where everything I said earlier about McCarthy meets its first challenge There are no pauses in this hectic madcappery not for a minute. So theres barely an opportunity for the star to modulate her energy. Even during more tender moments shes working her butt off. The fault I think isnt in our stars but in the script running up a huge comedy tab the likable players cant pay off.

Daily Edition Login to download Identity Thief Film Review 900 AM PST 2/6/2013 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Another rough comic movie road trip helps give car travel a bad name. TWITTER Melissa McCarthy and Jason Bateman star in this rough and tumble comic road movie from director Seth Gordon. With their releases coming less than two months apart the double-whammy of bad road trips represented in the under-performing The Guilt Trip and now the hard-to-watch Identity Thief may reduce the appeal of cross-country driving trips by a measurable amount. With Melissa McCarthy (no relation) playing a one-woman demolition team who for 95 percent of the running time is a genuine affront to nature there are unavoidably some laughs here although the gifted comic actor got more of them in less screen time in her previous films than she does in this starring role. Her following is so deservedly loyal that Universal should expect a robust opening weekend but the gas tank will likely run dry fairly soon. There may be some hidden Hollywood moral behind the display of bad behavior in the screenplay by Craig Mazin (Scary Movie 3 and 4 The Hangover II and III) advancing the notion that average people will accept all manner of abuse from stronger more assertive people (i.e. executives producers) as long as you throw them a crumb at the end of the day. On the other hand there may be no intent here other than to show what a truly amoral anti-social person is capable of. PHOTOS This Is Judd Apatow The King of Comedys Life in Pictures The premise is one with which anyone can sympathize of being the victim of scam artists who with little difficulty get a hold of your credit card numbers and vital data and go on a massive buying spree before you can stop it. The poor schnook here is ironically enough a Denver-based mid-level financial services guy Sandy Bigelow Patterson (Jason Bateman) who after having been insultingly ordered by his boss (Jon Favreau) to send huge bonus checks to top company executives agrees to join other mutinying workers in starting a new company. But the gig is imperiled when hes arrested for running up huge tabs in Winter Park Florida being behind on credit card payments and in all ways having become a no-account. That someones hijacked his name and financial wherewithal is easily established. But when a cop (Morris Chestnut) tells him it might take as long as a year to get the mess straightened out the script feels like its piling on just as it does when his new employer tells him hes got just a week to go down to Florida and deal with it or else his jobs history. Far-fetched may be the applicable term or perhaps preposterous isnt a stretch. VIDEO Identity Thief Trailer So bidding adieu to his beautiful supportive wife (Amanda Peet) and two young daughters Sandy flies to Florida where he has no problem tracking down the pretend Sandy otherwise known as Diana (McCarthy) who in turn has no trouble clocking the mild-mannered real Sandy with a punch to the throat. Sassy impudent full of herself and backlogged with reasons why shes always right and others are wrong Diana is nevertheless maneuvered into joining Sandy on a car trip to Denver agreeing to make things good with his new company as long as she doesnt have to speak to the police. Sandy is a reasonable guy a perfect if dubious straight man whose worry is losing sight of Diana especially at night when she could run off. Little does he know hes got unsavory company when it comes to having been ripped off by Diana; an imprisoned gangster has engaged two assassins (Tip T.I. Harris Genesis Roidriguez) to rub her out while a violent skiptracer (Robert Patrick) also takes to the road to reel her in. Diana is one of those grown-up problem children anyone may encounter somewhere along the way but only if youre very very unlucky. A brazen liar an unrepentant bully a woman who thanks Sandy when he calls her diabolical Diana is so repellent by nature that you wish that somewhere along the road Anton Chigurh would show up and give her the business. No question that the least appetizing interlude has Diana at a bar in Georgia start drinking and getting randy with a gent fittingly named Big Chuck (Eric Stonestreet) and eventually propose that they go back to the motel with Sandy because he likes to watch. The result isnt pretty and is far less funny than its meant to be under the direction of Seth Gordon whose Four Christmases proved equally laborious in charting unpleasant journeys. STORY Melissa McCarthy Jason Bateman Drew Laughs On Identity Thief Set When it seems that the ends justify the means Sandy momentarily lowers himself to Dianas moral standards which yields the inadvertent dividend of her finally pouring out the truth about herself. The monster is thus sentimentalized not let off the hook exactly but given at least a partial pardon. McCarthy has dominated in everything shes ever been in and its true in spades here as shes up against no other substantial comic performers; its just that Diana requires her to be so assaultive that she becomes too too much. Bateman does his job as the continuously put-upon straight man but he can only react to the hurricane from the South. Everyone else delivers whats required in one-dimensional support. Cutting about 15 minutes down to just a bit over 90 minutes wouldnt have hurt at all.

With ""Identity Thief"" Melissa McCarthy proves shes got what it takes to carry a feature however meager the underlying material. Sustaining the same brand of unpredictable energy that made her such an effective scene-stealer in ""Bridesmaids"" and ""This Is 40"" McCarthy plays the tornado to Jason Batemans uptight nebbish an accountant who drives halfway across the country to confront the zealous con artist who stole his personal information maxed out his credit cards and tarnished his good name. Though this adult-skewing comedy looks like a midrange performer at best McCarthys credit rating should skyrocket. The perfect sucker Sandy Patterson (Bateman reteaming with ""Horrible Bosses"" director Seth Gordon) is an underappreciated bean-counter for a Denver mega-corporation who naively offers a chipper-sounding telemarketer (McCarthy) his vital details then seems astonished when his credit card is declined at the pump. Pulled over a few blocks later by cops with a warrant for his arrest Sandy learns that in addition to racking up extravagant purchases on his cards the female impersonating him also jumped bail and tried to evade narcotics charges in Florida. From where the audience sits the irony is that hardly anyone would want this guys identity to begin with. Apart from his androgynous-sounding name -- the source of a running series of emasculating jokes -- Sandy seems as straight-laced and uninteresting as they come though the casting department supplies him with crazy-hot wife Amanda Peet to cheerlead from the sidelines. In all other respects hes a chump and what his life needs most is something to shake him up and remind him hes a man. Certainly thats the idea of sending him on a road trip to ""pretty much the worst place in America"" to apprehend his doppelganger and drag her back to face charges in Denver. Anyone whos ever been the target of such fraud can tell you that trying to track down an identity thief in person is the last thing to do but screenwriter Craig Mazin (who shares story credit with Jerry Eeten) has conceived a razor-blades-on-the-outside mushy-in-the-middle laffer where the culprit isnt half as bad as she initially seems. On first encounter fake ""Sandy"" aka Diane (McCarthy) freaks out when her mark confronts her stealing his car and trying to ram him off the highway. As if she werent dangerous enough it turns out that Dianes being pursued by a pair of contract killers (Tip ""T.I."" Harris and Genesis Rodriguez) who barge into her white-trash lair with guns blazing (the art directors clearly had a field day cramming a tiny home with as much tacky shopping-spree booty as they could manage). Sandys plan is to drag Diane back to Denver and clear his record. Not trusting the basic road-trip premise to carry the show the script piles on several tired 80s-movie cliches thrusting the pair into artificial peril as they try to outmaneuver an aggressive redneck bounty hunter (Robert Patrick) those two hitmen and the cops. But the funniest moments have nothing to do with these gimmicks relying on the character-driven dynamic between the pics polar-opposite protags as when Diane demonstrates her quick wit by inventing humiliating cover stories for the couple wherever they go. However grating Sandy may find her Diane is undeniably charming to everyone they meet a lonely woman driven by an insatiable desire to be loved -- a quality that brings auds around to her side long before Sandy realizes there might be more to this woman than he first imagined. Since the writers have left Batemans character such a blank (with no real problems of his own to work out en route) the films success depends almost entirely on the salty energy McCarthy brings to the equation. Among the cameos peppered along the way the rowdiest -- and most unrecognizable -- comes from ""Modern Familys"" Eric Stonestreet as Big Chuck a cowboy haplessly smitten with Diane. The ensuing love scene is sure to leave scars for some viewers but serves to defuse whatever romantic chemistry auds might expect between the two leads. Its actually surprising that ""Identity Thief"" doesnt allow love to bloom between Sandy and Diane By never considering Diane as a rival for Peets wooden housewife the film reveals plus-size problems baked into its body-image ideas. Generally speaking the brightly lensed snappily edited pic leaves auds wanting more despite a few distracting visual effects and one or two dead-end subplots it could have done without.

How many ways can a grown person waste valuable time and lose vital I.Q. points at the same time? If youre a movie critic the possibilities are unlimited. And they all come together in a new chunk of junk called Identity Thief. IDENTITY THIEF  (1/4 stars) Written by Craig Mazin Directed by Seth Gordon Starring Jason Bateman Melissa McCarthy and John Cho Running time 111 min. In the trashy stupefying screenplay by Craig Mazin Jason Bateman is a Denver accountant named Sandy Patterson--another in a long line of victims of the increasingly dangerous world of cyber-crime--whose credit card has been hacked and copied by a felonious thief in Miami (cacophonous tractor-sized Melissa McCarthy). Now there are two Sandy Pattersons--an innocent fraud victim on one side of the country facing bankruptcy and a screeching humongous creep on a marathon shopping spree on the other side of the country who is running up thousands of dollars in charges and wrecking her victims credit rating in the process. The police do nothing the male Sandy loses his job and faces jail time and the only solution is to devise a plan to apprehend the fake female Sandy and drag her from Florida back to Colorado to turn herself in and clear his good name. In order to stretch a five-minute idea into 107 minutes of contrived drivel some people may mistake for plot the plan backfires. She beats him up steals his wallet wrecks his rental car and leaves him stranded on the highway in a pair of pants stolen from a dead hobo. With no identification or money he gets arrested for assaulting an officer drug dealing and illegal gun possession. And still against all odds they hit the road to Colorado pursued by killers bounty hunters and ""skip tracers"" who track down crooks who owe money to gangsters jump parole and get involved in other intrigues invented by hack Hollywood screenwriters. The snafus in the worst road movie since The Guilt Trip plunge Mr. Bateman and his female hippo into a motel with only a double bed a grotesque sex scene with a pickled reprobate she picks up in a bar who demands a threesome a violent bar fight that bloodies his nose a kidnapping a multi-car collision going the wrong way on the freeway ... but why go on? They seem to be making it up as they go along in a movie that threatens never to end. By the time they got lost in the woods and fall into a den of hissing snakes Elvis has long since left the building. Melissa McCarthy (Bridesmaids) is a gimmick comedian who has devoted her short career to being obese and obnoxious with equal success. Poor Jason Bateman. How did an actor so charming talented attractive and versatile get stuck in so much dreck? Identity theft is a real plague that is happening so often that people tremble every time they approach an ATM. Its a deserving subject that should be explored in a more viable film but Identity Thief is so bad its hard to believe it wasnt directed by Judd Apatow or the Farrelly Brothers.

Separately Jason Bateman and Melissa McCarthy bring impeccable timing and impressive improv skills to anything they do. Put these two dynamos together and it would be virtually impossible to make a movie that wasnt omigod hilarious right? Right? From the famous-last-words department comes this comedic felony that efficiently wastes not one but two major talents in one fell swoop. It starts out promisingly No sooner has McCarthys scam artist bilked Batemans financial-industry everyguy out of his Social Security number etc. before shes charging jetskis and extravagant nightclub tabs to his credit card. Watch McCarthys face as she injects such wide-eyed gosh-all glee into her characters mania; its like observing an animated Disney critter on a crack high. Then listen to the deadpan way Bateman addresses his kids at a birthday dinner (""Thank you all for coming""). Enjoy those brief guffaws folks since once his disgraced hero decides to drag this credit-fraud criminal from Florida to Colorado--bring on the gratuitous bounty hunter and drug-lord henchmen--the silence that greets the films desperate lunges at humor becomes deafening. After his previous movie Horrible Bosses (2011) former documentarian Seth Gordon established that cringe comedy really wasnt his forte; this painful endeavor confirms he should stick to nonfiction. No matter how may times Identity Thief switches tracks nothing works--it fails as a star vehicle a recession-era satire a WTF white-collar-grunt revenge tale a Midnight Run-style buddy flick a gross-out laughfest and a bathetic tale of broken souls. No amount of stolen guises can fix it.
