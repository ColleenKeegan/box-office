Share Tweet Think of Gods Not Dead as the Old Testament--a narrative of punitive punishments meted out to non-believers with a serious angry streak--and its sequel as the New Testament. The first film focused on a student standing up to a philosophy professor demanding his students renounce the lord God Jehovahs existence entirely whereas this second film is about Jesus and grace. Specifically Grace Wesley (Melissa Joan Hart) an 11th-grade history teacher who gets in big trouble after quoting and comparing Jesus words to MLKs in class. Enter the ACLUs seething angry Pete Kane (Ray Wise) who straight-up says that he has ""pure hate"" for proselytizing Christians.Compared to the unwieldy multiple storylines of the first film Gods Not Dead 2 is relatively streamlined using the subsequent trial as a throughline around which returning characters from the first film converge. Theres Pastor Dave (Christian movie mainstay David A.R. White) whos called to serve as a juror; Chinese student Martin (Paul Kwo) successfully evangelized by the first films end and now struggling to understand his new faith; and journalist Amy Ryan (Trisha LaFache). In the first film Amy was immediately diagnosed with breast cancer after daring to question the sincerity of Duck Dynastys Willie Robertson on the importance of wifely submission; here shes cancer-free again which triggers her to wonder whether her faith wasnt merely a matter of panic.The opening helicopter shots (though perhaps just stock footage) indicate were operating at a realm of higher budget and competence than the baldly cheap badly assembled first film. There are some inexplicable shot choices--a pull-back from a huge close-up of a stapler on a classroom desk is a howler--but its a more smoothly made product the narrative wheels greased by old pros Wise (who acts like hes still possessed by Twin Peaks Bob) and Ernie Hudson as the presiding judge both significant upgrades from Kevin Sorbo and Dean Cain to be sure.The first film pandered to a heavy persecution complex; this installments relatively subtler but there are dog whistles aplenty. When the school board is unwilling to directly punish Grace a board member wonders ""How do we make this go away without getting blood on our hands?"" The public school system and those pesky teachers unions are Pontius Pilate while the ACLU are the Roman soldiers prepping for another round of martyrdom. Kane approaches the parents of the student who asked the question prompting Graces answer luring them with the promise that being at the center of a division of church and state case would make her very attractive to Ivy League schools a reminder that elitist higher education inculcates godlessness. (The parents sign their deal with Kane with a symbolically blood-red pen no less.) On TV a seething liberal pundit says ""the religious extremists we really need to worry about are the hardcore Christians"" cueing audiences to indulge their Islamophobic tendencies (possibly by remembering the Muslim father in the first film who kicks his daughter out after he finds her listening to Franklin Graham). ""Diversity and tolerance"" are mockingly invoked as tools to suppress Christians and the culture wars extend to the courtrooms jury selection process. With each side having veto power they ask what each prospective viewers favorite TV show is; the godless veto Duck Dynasty viewers the godly nix Pretty Little Liars fans. There are also several very unsubtle plugs for Prius a reminder that movies are business propositions some more cynical than others. The main goal is still stoking a sense of paranoia. When Grace speaks of ""escalating persecution"" against Jesus and MLK the audience is supposed to feel persecuted themselves. A subplot about churches having their sermons subpoenaed--one attempt was made in Houston by an overreaching official and quickly shut down--prompts speeches about the federal government cracking down on belief that are one step away from rambling about FEMA concentration camps. Graces (atheist) lawyer Tom Endler (Jesse Metcalfe) constructs his argument as a slippery slope First he argues Grace was merely delivering historical facts then he trots out some (real best-selling) Christian apologists to make the historically irrefutable case for Jesus. By films end hes basically saying if you cant talk about Jesus in the schools then the never-ending persecution of Christians will continue. As the Newsboys song ""Guilty"" declaims at the end ""When did it become breaking a rule to say your name out loud in school?"" Thats a gross exaggeration and the film shoots itself in the foot by constructing a case bearing no potential resemblance to reality. There are certainly places where communities indulge in school prayer because its the norm so its hard to imagine that an Arkansas school district would get this freaked out about a secular exchange. The climactic showdown--children of faith on the courthouse steps being yelled at by a horde of angry atheists--is parallel universe fiction. In any case the movies thesis line isnt one of its many scriptural citations or exhortations to faith but a line among pastors discussing the possibility of a federal crackdown ""Dont forget the silent majority."" From its lecture on the conservative canard that separation of church and state is a myth on down Gods Not Dead 2 is a movie for Ralph Reeds Moral Majority with all the entangled political baggage that comes with it.

The Almighty is still alive albeit also under continuing attack in ""Gods Not Dead 2"" a sequel in which the issue of religion in schools leads to a courtroom showdown over Gods rightful place in society. Boasting a superficially new plot but preaching the exact same sermon - in the identical leaden graceless manner - as its predecessor Harold Cronks follow-up concocts a laughable crisis of faith whose resolution is a fait accompli turning the endeavor into a torturous exercise in one-note proselytizing. The franchises disciples will surely fill its collection plate as full as 2014s 60-million-grossing original but this paranoid persecution-complex fantasy is unlikely to win many converts. Cronks original installment presented Kevin Sorbos atheistic liberal-arts professor as the embodiment of satanic evil. Since he literally died for his sins at the end of that story - only after making a deathbed conversion to Christ however - the filmmakers latest turns to another anti-conservative archetype for its bad guy an ACLU lawyer here embodied by Ray Wise as a disbelieving shark who ""hates"" Christians beliefs and who wants to use his newest case to ""prove once and for all that God is dead"" Visually demarcated by his swanky shoes designer suit and borderline-maniacal eyes Wises Pete Kane is presented as a veritable demon fit for a David Lynch film. ""Gods Not Dead 2"" though doesnt mean him to be a caricature but rather a realistic emblem of the ""vicious"" forces that - as Pastor Dave (David A.R. White) tells a group of ministers led by Fred Dalton Thompson - are waging a genuine ""war"" against Christians. The notion that Christians are an oppressed minority beset on all sides by secular ""rationalist"" forces (including the government which wants Pastor Dave to hand over his sermons) is bluntly articulated throughout. And the effect of such talk is to situate the action in a fictional world that seems at once recognizable - it is for example populated by humans who can speak eat and weep - and yet so topsy-turvy as to be the stuff of science-fiction. Again collaborating with screenwriters Chuck Konzelman and Cary Solomon Cronks tale focuses on high-school history teacher Grace (Melissa Joan Hart) who finds herself facing the school boards fire-and-brimstone wrath when while lecturing about Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. student Brooke (Hayley Orrantia) asks about the similarities between those leaders and Jesus and Grace responds by quoting scripture. According to her bosses (led by Robin Givens mean principal) such biblical discourse violates state and federal laws governing separation of church and state. Thus Brookes parents are soon filing suit against Grace with the aid of Wises villainous lawyer who promises them that the ensuing publicity will somehow help their daughter get into a good college if only theyll sign on the Faustian dotted line. Refusing to accept a deal that requires her to formally apologize for voicing her pious opinions Grace makes a David-vs.-Goliath stand on behalf of the Lord and in doing so is equated by the film as a principled kindred spirit to Gandhi Dr. King and Jesus himself. Represented by scrappy young Tom Endler (Jesse Metcalfe) whos not a Christian but respects his clients staunch convictions Grace heads to court where the proceedings - overseen by Ernie Hudsons bellowing-judge caricature - soon devolve into cartoonishness with jurors accepted or denied on the basis of their favorite TV shows (""Duck Dynasty"" is acceptable to the faithful; ""Pretty Little Liars"" is preferred by blasphemers) and legal councils indulging in endless ham-fisted oration. Just as its precursor trotted out minorities (Chinese Muslims Africans) and yet characterized them in inauthentic ways that suggested no one associated with the film had any actual knowledge about people from these cultural/ethnic groups ""Gods Not Dead 2"" delivers copious back-and-forth arguments about separation of church and state that seem wholly divorced from any rational understanding of the topic. Instead that subject is merely a flimsy pretext for a depiction of the tyrannical discrimination faced by Christians as well as the fundamental legitimacy of their views. By the time Endler mounts a courtroom defense rooted in proving that Jesus was a historical figure - thus making him fit for public classroom dialogue - the proceedings have long since ditched any pretense of legitimate intellectual debate in favor of convoluted evangelizing. Given a script that articulates every idea in the bluntest manner possible the cast cant help but come across as creaky and cornball. Thats also true of returning supporting players including Trisha LaFaches Amy whos been cured of cancer by God and who bafflingly writes blog posts by narrating her thoughts into a phone; and Paul Kwos Martin who now sees a future for himself in the ministry despite his dads disapproval. And its definitely the case with Pat Boone who as Graces invalid grandfather opines that atheism ""doesnt take away the pain. It only takes away the hope"" and spouts holy homilies like ""Honey you of all people should realize when youre going through something really hard the teacher is always quiet during the test."" Cronk shoots everything in Hallmark Channel-style glowing sunlight that complements his bright colorful sets and soundtrack of wannabe-inspirational Christian rock (replete with another climactic Newsboys performance). That aesthetic lack of subtlety is apt considering that dramatically speaking ""Gods Not Dead 2"" operates at the level of your average middle-school play - except with far greater levels of upside-down logic and bald-faced intolerance for anyone not enraptured by the New Testament.

John says July 25 2016 at 323 pm I loved Gods not dead 1 it was hilarious to see it all play out. And that horrible athiest guy Kevin sorbo "" I will prove God is dead"".. Its so dumb to think Oh Im a Christian whos persecuted.. Cant wait to see this one now that its on DVD. That song is catchy. Thats what you get Kevin sorbo . Reply Woodrow Fields says April 24 2016 at 528 am Mr Schager I greatly disagree with your one sided opinion of Gods Not Dead 2. It is very real in this culture that WE (and YES I AM an absolute Believer In The Work and Redemption Of Jesus Christ MY Lord) live in and yes that includes all non Christians as well. It is a society that does not have any desire to be accountable for immoral or perverse behaviors no culpability. I could only determine based on your review that you are one who is a doubter but my prayer for you is that you will be enlightened by the message of The Gospel and be Transformed into a new creation In Christ Jesus. Reply John G. Havrisik says May 14 2016 at 643 pm Amen. Reply Kathy says April 13 2016 at 1056 am I think this movie is an improvement over the first one. The acting was better as well as the overall flow of the film. Im looking forward to the next one. If you do not understand that persecution against Christians is going on then you must not be reading the paper or watching the news. There have been scores of cases of Christians losing jobs losing businesses and being told to keep their religious conversations out of the public square. If you stayed for the credits you would have seen a long list of those. And there are many more. I personally know someone who lost his job because of similar circumstances portrayed in this film. When I go to a movie that is not a Christian or family film I have to put up with the bad language explicit immorality and graphic violence which is very offensive to me. If I complain about those things Im told to stay home. So If you dont like this movie stay home. I am just glad there is someone making something I can go see that does not offend my faith. So kudos to those who are producing starring and directing these films. Reply Mark Piper says April 11 2016 at 842 pm The painful thing is that there is actual intelligent debate going on regarding faith and its place in our society and this movie utterly fails to portray the argument on any level and fails to make the movie the least bit compelling. All it manages to do is preach to the choir. Reply Martin Mayberry says April 9 2016 at 732 am I heard all the bad reviews about Gods Not dead 1 and i saw it and it was awesome And I figure that this movie will be the exact same The review will be split down the lines of the Cross of Christ If you believe in Christ you will like it and if you do not believe in Christ you will not That is my take and when you stand before God that split according to the Bible will become very evident and then will be The sheep and the goats Reply Jon Fingas (jonfingas) says April 10 2016 at 1242 pm So you havent watched the movie and youre convinced that every Christian will automatically like it when theres plenty of evidence to suggest the contrary? You might want to watch it and talk to other Christians (especially those who dont share your exact views) before reaching a conclusion like that. If anything this movie is anti-Christian. Its smug (Christians are portrayed as perfect creatures) it lies (it creates persecution where none exists) and it expresses nothing but hatred for non-Christians. What happened to your religion embracing humility truthfulness compassion and forgiveness? I know those exist in Christianity but theyre nowhere to be found in Gods Not Dead 2. Reply John G. Havrisik says May 14 2016 at 738 pm Truly Jon Fingas ones self-truth always attempts to ""persecute"" The Truth because self-truth is based on a lie to ones own soul. As such the bias and prejudice which exists in self-truth not only must openly deny The Truth but it also must attempt to practice public ""perversion"" to The Truth. Perversion being defined as ""the alteration of something from its original course meaning or state to a distortion or corruption of what was first intended."" as in ""all great evil is the perversion of a good"". Thus the public practices synonymous to ""perversion"" include the acts of ""distortion misrepresentation falsification travesty misinterpretation misconstruction twisting corruption subversion misuse misapplication debasement"" to The Truth. The ""split"" that Martin speaks of takes account of Christs First Commandment i.e. loving God first and foremost including the acknowledging and accepting The Truth made flesh i.e. Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. Truly Christ who did the will of God had the attributes of ""humility truthfulness compassion and forgiveness"" to the point of the ultimate sacrifice i.e. the laying down of His own life for the sins of mankind. It is the self-truth of man which denied and put Christ to death and choosing to release a known murderer instead and it is the same self-truth of mankind today that persecuted The Truth and those who know The Truth attempting to make a god in their own image but their truly is only One God. For self-truth and the men who profess their self-truth do not have the attributes you identified above in your response to Martin. John 316-17 William Miller says April 9 2016 at 1114 am So like the movie or burn in hell? Well thats subtle. Reply John G. Havrisik says May 14 2016 at 742 pm Acknowledge and accept Jesus Christ ad Lord and Savior or suffer the penalty. John 316-17 Amy Johnson says April 5 2016 at 132 pm I just returned from viewing Gods Not Dead 2. It is equal or even better than Gods Not Dead 1. It very timely as the War is Christianity is being fought from the White House on down. The Bible speaks of a spiritual battle which is not a flesh and blood battle. There needs to be spiritual discernment to fully comprehend the corruption of the human spirit that manifests itself in the government down to the Media and the schools which are deceiving the young. Understanding TRUTH begins with Jesus who is the Way the Truth and the Life. Satan is the father of lies. We are being lied to by the spiritual wickedness in high places. Reply Greg says April 4 2016 at 1026 am Of course a Christian film is going to be reviewed by a non-Christian - hence the bad review. Of course the author isnt into the New Testament or eternal life or a biblical message. Family-friendly movies are rare. Two thumbs up that a Christian film is even in theaters these days. Reply Cindy Smith says April 4 2016 at 839 am I saw GODS NOT DEAD when it came out through Redbox. Then we bought our won copy. When I heard that a second installment was coming out I started counting down the days untill the release. I wonered if GODS NOT DEAD 2 was going to be like so man other sequels Ive seenn over the years but I found it was better than the first. ( Yes I cried through it too butI paid attention to the story as well.) If you havent seen thhe movie yet...be sure to say and watch till the end of the credits. I have a feeling that 3 is coming soon. I grew up with family oriented movies. I watched Godzilla Mothra and King Kong destroy Japan and New York. I watched Dumbo overcome the bullying of the other elephants in the circus to show them how special he really was. Ive watched aliens destroy the worl people being killed in one movie only to show up in another movie ""all better"". Im old enough to know ""its only a movie"" but Im tired of trying to find only violent moviies being offered. Wake up Hollywood We need to get back to the family. Theres enough violence on our streets lets keep it off the big screens. Reply Randy Franz says April 3 2016 at 801 pm Sounds like someone needs a little fiber in His diet I would rather my kids see a ""cornball"" film like this than some of the trashy obscenities put out by the arrogant manipulators from Viacom and others who look down on middle Amercan values. We dont need pompous mental midgets mocking the Silent Majority. We get it and know what films and media is to be used for. Its only a film enjoy it. Lighten up. Sincerely yours An Old Fashioned Cornball who loves Pat Boone and the cast. R.A.F. Reply Mishael says April 3 2016 at 404 pm Those who dont like the movie are obviously entitled to their opinions but if you are a Christian you know where the movie is headed... Get in the Spirit... In my opinion it was better than the first because the storyline was better but there were elements that someone who doesnt know Yahweh wouldnt understand.. Reply Aaron1968 says April 3 2016 at 1043 am This sounds truly hilarious. I may have to check it out on Netflix or something. Im not a huge fan of comedy in general but this does sound really really funny. Reply Sarah says April 2 2016 at 1006 pm Every time a faith based film gets panned by the critics conservative Christians everywhere come out of the woodwork to claim that any poor reviews are just result of anti-Christian bias. It happened with the last movie and the moment I saw there was going to be a sequel I knew it would happen with this one. Just read the comments here. The thing about Christian films is that the filmmakers tend to just not be that good at making movies and theres no way around that. Partly its because they know they dont have to be. Christians will pay to watch ANY faith based film no matter how bad it is and they will defend it until their dying day. Kirk Camerons Saving Christmas is a perfect example of that. It made three million dollars on a half a million dollar budget. With a 0% on rotten tomatoes SMH. I actually watched the first Gods Not Dead. It was pure tripe - junk food for the brain aimed at the conservative WASP crowd who have been spoon fed the ""Christian persecution"" myth by right-wing pundits and politicians who think that a cashier saying happy holidays instead of Merry Christmas is evidence of oppression. It was chock full of bad acting worse writing and enough cheese to stock a pizza parlor. So rest assured my Christian friends. All the bad reviews you see of this movie are genuine and legitimate. There is no conspiracy. A bad film is a bad film no matter the message. You can whine all you want but remember this - if you keep forking over your money to see these movies theyll never get any better. Why would they? They know youll pay to watch anything. Reply Traci says April 4 2016 at 251 pm Exactly Christians are not critical consumers and will devour anything with the name Jesus in it even if its terrible. As a Christian and a pastors wife I do not feel persecuted and do not feel the need to spend my money on bad cinema. The separation of church and state is part of our constitution not some new agenda by atheists to make our lives more difficult. Reply Martin Mayberry says April 9 2016 at 737 am In what way is this movie just not good?it is a very well made movie and gets the point across very well C. Sanders says April 2 2016 at 958 pm Just saw the movie and really enjoyed it The fact that the film critic literally did not have one positive thing to say leads me to believe he couldnt wait to rip it to shreads...regardless of it cinematic prowess. His sarcastic and condescending words are an example of what leaves Christians feeling attacked and ridiculed. I do pray that God will give him eyes to see the truth. Reply Maria De Luca (maria82871) says April 2 2016 at 653 pm Ive seen the first movie and now Im looking to see this movie. If you cant judge a movie because of its being a faith base or not then maybe you should be looking for a new job. Reply Johanna Caron says April 2 2016 at 454 pm I just saw the movie today and I absolutely loved it. I cried the whole movie and that my friends is the power of the Holy Spirit. Reply Paranoid_android (Clazziquai_Nico) says April 3 2016 at 938 am Did this Holy Spirit beat you or sumethin? Reply joe says April 2 2016 at 515 pm The power of the Holy Spirit is making you cry for 2 hours straight when youre supposed to be paying attention to a movie? Reply PartyWill says April 1 2016 at 956 pm hankies sorry auto correct sucks Reply C castile says April 2 2016 at 1057 am You must be in a total state of denial. Because situations like this ARE happening all across America. Its not fiction. Not by a long shot. Reply Pete says April 2 2016 at 517 pm Who are you talking to anyway? You didnt even reply to the right comment. Pete says April 2 2016 at 516 pm Cite facts. PartyWill says April 1 2016 at 955 pm This looks like a very enlightning movie  from its message alone I am prepared to grab some nannies to what is hinting to be a very powerful and emotional film that will touch your heart  Reply Korou says April 1 2016 at 641 pm There is plenty of Christian persecution in the USA. Hordes of angry haters led by vicious politicians attacking someone who is just standing up for what is right. It really is real it really does happen. Of course the case Im thinking of was that ""evil little thing"" Jessica Ahlquist. And the angry hordes were the Christians. Christian persecution is alive and well. Its the Christians doing the persecuting. Reply JD says April 3 2016 at 936 am Christian persecution is real huh? Name one Ill wait...... Reply brbr2424 says April 8 2016 at 627 pm JD the commentor is saying Christian persecution is rare not real. The persecution of others by Christians is not rare particularly in the South. brbr2424 says April 8 2016 at 626 pm Exactly. A teacher describes how GND2 happened to him but in reverse. He was a closeted atheist teacher in Mississippi and he was treated very poorly. See the blog Godless in Dixie. bluehawk232 (bluehawk232) says April 1 2016 at 501 pm I find it ironic they are setting this in a court room to prove Jesus when the courts dont accept hearsay as testimony Reply Mike says April 1 2016 at 529 pm Its a movie. Get it? Reply TammyO_RN says April 1 2016 at 457 pm I loved this movie. I think its better than the 1st one. Dont let these critics keep you from seeing a faith based movie that gives a message of hope. Reply Nana Evelyn says April 1 2016 at 449 pm A good film especially for Christians and the others will have to search their heart. God changed my life and I am saved. I pray for all to seek Him that they experience the joy I have Through Christ. Reply Some dude says April 1 2016 at 150 pm Devout anti-theist reviews Christian based film. Complete with inaccurate portrayals contempt for people that believe in a God and petty jabs at actors/actresses for having the audacity to be in a movie about something the author despises for whatever reason. Must he tough living with such hate in your heart. Reply jsm1963 says April 1 2016 at 248 pm Or maybe the movies just terrible. Reply Jerry says April 2 2016 at 644 pm Did you see either one of the movies? Macy says April 1 2016 at 231 pm if theres no god how can she/he not be dead? Makes no sense. WHICH GOD ANYWAY? There are so MANY. Reply Nope says April 17 2016 at 227 pm Moose no one thinks cows are gods you bigot. Crack open a book some day. brbr2424 says April 8 2016 at 631 pm Christians cannot accept that there are people who dont believe in gods and in particular dont believe in their god God. They create strawman atheists who are ""mad at God"" or say ""God is dead"". I dont believe unicorns exist. I am not mad at unicorns and I would never say unicorns are dead. Moose says April 1 2016 at 409 pm There is only one. Do you think a cow is a god? use your brain. TJ Scott says April 1 2016 at 131 pm And if I am enraptured by the New Testament. will I enjoy this movie Mr Critic? Reply jsm1963 says April 1 2016 at 253 pm Maybe Mr. Critic is saying you should expect better from filmmakers. Reply Bruce says April 1 2016 at 126 pm I enjoyed the first one looking forward to taking the family to see the second. Hope it does well. Reply screenzealots says April 1 2016 at 138 pm I think the first one was far better than this sequel (and thats coming from the perspective of a nonbeliever). But since you were a fan of the first youll probably enjoy it (lots of the original characters reappear in ""Gods Not Dead 2""). Reply Bruce says April 1 2016 at 214 pm I hope my family enjoys it. We all enjoyed the first one quite a bit and well go with an open mind. It seemed the others in the theaters enjoyed the first one as well there was a HUGE round of applause at the end that caught me off guard so this is a welcomed film. HWB says April 1 2016 at 122 pm Good to see diversity and inclusiveness here in which people of faith also have an opportunity to see something that may interest them. Thats true diversity. Reply Dunstan says April 1 2016 at 1244 pm This movie sounds laughable on just about every level. Reply Some guy says April 1 2016 at 152 pm So....dont watch it then. Reply ryukagesama says April 1 2016 at 255 pm Why would they not watch it if they expect to be laughing the whole time. Ham says April 1 2016 at 1242 pm Still going to see it despite the bigoted review. Reply A Believer says April 1 2016 at 546 pm I am a Christian. I saw the first Gods Not Dead. It was crap. Wild horses couldnt drag me to see this new one. Faith-based movies neednt be so cheesy. Reply urdrago says April 1 2016 at 425 pm You have no idea what true persecution is WASP.

Its success in the multiplex is represented by mainstream fare such as ""Heaven is for Real"" and ""Miracles from Heaven"" yet it was jump-started by rough-hewn cheaply made independent releases such as ""Fireproof"" and turned into a head-turning business concern by the box-office fire of ""Gods Not Dead"" and ""War Room."" Beyond the differences in production values and competency in execution the two product streams represent a crucial contrast in tone. The films designed for a mass audience are quieter more personal and less aggressive. They resist easy answers and while assertively Christian do not proselytize. The films made and seen primarily by Christian audiences however are much more likely to embrace the coded often politically charged language of conservative Evangelicals. This is the world of the ""Gods Not Dead"" franchise. See Video Melissa Joan Hart Fights Big Bad ACLU in Trailer for Gods Not Dead 2 That 2014 release reworked to pointed effect an urban legend centered on a Christian college student triumphing in a debate over the existence of God with an atheist philosophy professor. A decades-old story circulated around the internet and before that in sermons and religious comic tracts from legendary publisher Jack T. Chick its variations refresh themselves over time yet have no basis in fact. The sequel though attaches itself to a very real American political phenomenon the upsurge in the number of states considering or passing religious liberty bills into law. Arkansas high school teacher Grace Wesley (Melissa Joan Hart ""Melissa amp; Joey"") in the course of a lesson about Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Gandhi explains to students the Christian underpinnings of Kings philosophy of non-violence and faces the loss of her job for doing so. Appropriate from a pedagogic standpoint in a real classroom this statement of historical fact wouldnt raise an eyebrow. Here it becomes a referendum on the existence of God and the public use of the name ""Jesus."" Also Read Gods Not Dead 2 Set to Keep Faith-Based Caravan Rolling at Box Office She engages the services of defense lawyer Tom Endler (Jesse Metcalfe ""Desperate Housewives"") while the prosecution (heavily implied to be from the American Civil Liberties Union) arrives in the form of character actor Ray Wise (""Twin Peaks"") a man whose face can turn demonic with the barest of smiles. In a seemingly unrelated subplot -- stay past the closing credits for an explanation -- returning character Reverend Dave (producer David A. R. White ""Moms Night Out"") is subpoenaed and ordered to turn over copies of his recent sermons to local authorities. Naturally he refuses and since the film refuses to disclose any reasons for the subpoena the audience is encouraged to assume that the widespread persecution of all Christians is at hand. In Arkansas. A wild barking dog of a movie the first ""Gods Not Dead"" played both defense and offense creating straw-man arguments villainous non-believers and the satisfying destruction of both. Returning director Harold Cronk and screenwriting team Chuck Konzelman and Cary Solomon (""Do You Believe?"") have this time around chosen not to mess with success. Bolstered by more polished production values and a higher caliber cast of actors (Hart is an effectively sympathetic presence) the dialogue feels less like preaching and more like true conversation between actual human beings. The outcome may be as predictable as before but its courtroom drama features at least as much tension as a reasonably well-made episode of television. However in spite of Cronks more assured filmmaking ""Gods Not Dead 2"" remains first and foremost loyal to an unstated message that will trouble all but its target audience that conservative Christianity should not be merely one voice in American cultural discourse but that it should enjoy uncontested dominion. Also Read Gods Not Dead Isnt Going Away and Neither Are Faith-Based Films Thats no more or less a worthwhile premise than say deciding whether Batman or Superman should be the boss of all superheroes. But ""Gods Not Dead 2"" cannot be honest with itself or its audience about its intentions. It improves on its predecessor by grounding the plot in headline-making reality but its disingenuous story lines do a disservice to real court cases that attempt to sort out the demarcation between personal faith and civic life in the United States. It pulls back from the original films cruelty and comeuppances for non-believers yet its non-Christian characters are still parodies of human evil greedy bitter violent and out to prove that ""God is dead."" To beat back those fictional enemies the film employs real life authors J. Warner Wallace and Lee Strobel playing themselves as trial witnesses and its with their arrival that the film comes closest to its own beating heart. Both men have written books on the subject of Christian apologetics the branch of Evangelicalism that defends faith with rational fact-based arguments and theyre given screen time to state their respective cases for an ""evidentially true"" Christianity. In any other courtroom drama the presence of outsiders with no legitimate stake in a case would be considered irrelevant. But this is the court of Evangelical Law and shoehorning in the authors respective testimonies returns ""Gods Not Dead 2"" to its win-at-all-cost roots. In the films world an argument about power is at stake and its an argument that must go on in perpetuity a persecution-based war fantasy that must never cease to rage. Otherwise its soldiers might be forced to find a truly worthwhile expression of faith on earth.

Powered by WordPress.com VIP Sponsored Content Entertainment Bill Zwecker 03/31/2016 1245pm Gods Not Dead 2 Too much Bible thumping bruises the story Jesse Metcalfe and Melissa Joan Hart in ""Gods Not Dead 2."" | PureFlix Bill Zwecker billzwecker | email In a season when we seem to be getting more than the usual number of faith-based films being released -- including ""Miracles From Heaven"" ""Risen"" and ""The Young Messiah"" -- we now have the sequel to 2014s enormously successful ""Gods Not Dead."" To be fair ""sequel"" is something of a misnomer here. While there are a number of recurring characters from the original movie the emphasis here now skews younger -- moving the action from the college campus to a high school setting and making our protagonist a deeply Christian teacher as opposed to an equally devout male student. The teacher in ""Gods Not Dead 2"" is Grace Wesley played quite competently by Melissa Joan Hart. She runs into trouble with her Arkansas schools administration after one of Wesleys history students asks her to discuss Jesus Christ in a historical context alongside the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. While commenting on Christ in her classroom Wesley makes her Christian faith is readily evident to all present. In short order that comes to the attention of the schools superintendent played by Robin Givens who orders Wesley to apologize for crossing the line between church and state in her classroom. She refuses prompting firebrand civil rights advocates -- portrayed here as wild-eyed zealots (especially in Ray Wises over-the-top performance as the civil rights attorney) -- to convince the inquiring students parents to file a lawsuit. The idea is to make it a class-action case that the petitioners hope will lead to a court decision denying the historical proof of Christs existence. Without question the underlying issues presented in this film are relevant in todays world as the rights of Christians to freely express their religious convictions in a public forum or institution are often challenged. However I only wish there had been more subtlety in the way the ""Gods Not Dead 2"" filmmakers had attempted to make their case. The agenda here is front and center from start to finish and while the actors do a yeomans job in presenting their characters with aplomb (especially Jesse Metcalfe as Wesleys lawyer) the entire film simply comes off as a two-hour jazzed-up movie version of a sermon. 1/2 PureFlix presents a film directed by Harold Cronk and written by Chuck Konzelman and Cary Solomon. Running time 121 minutes. Rated PG (for for some thematic elements). Opens Friday at local theaters.
