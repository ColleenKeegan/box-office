About a third of the way into Evita she gets her chance as Eva Duarte the future diva-saint of Argentina throws herself at Juan Peron the charismatic army general-turned-politician whos fast on his way to taking over the country. As the two retreat to Evas bedroom they sing the imploring duet ""Id Be Surprisingly Good for You."" Its the prettiest number weve heard so far if only because its wistful melody line makes more than a passing nod to ""Yesterday."" With the camera gliding around them Madonnas rapt powerstruck Eva stares at Jonathan Pryces wryly imperious Juan and begins to sing. Is she aflame with love seduced by Perons populist bravado? Or is she a visionary manipulator affixing herself to a rising star? Technically Madonnas singing is beautiful -- elegant silky refined. Yet theres no fire no twinkle of ambitious joy to her performance. Her face is fixed almost tranquilized -- a porcelain mask. Its hard to tell whats going on in her. Were watching the defining moment of Eva Perons life and it looks for all the world like an upscale champagne commercial. If theres a role Madonna seemed born to play it was Eva Peron -- or at least the sexy ruthless camp-myth Eva Peron at the center of Evita a musical that delights in holding up its heroine to the glitzy distorting mirror of showbiz. First produced on the London stage in 1978 (and then a year later on Broadway) Evita was ahead of its time in its chic fascination with fame with the power of glamour and with the once-novel idea of insatiable feminine ambition. Evita fashion-plat goddess of the proletariat Dead of cancer at 33 -- but really martyred by her pitiless drive Politics as superstardom Demagoguery as high kitsch It all looks more than a trifle old hat now. Still Evita could have worked had it been staged as larger-than-life spectacle. The film was once set to be made by Oliver Stone (he retains a coscreenwriting credit) and a director like Stone might have tapped the lurid grandstanding appeal of a musical whose heroine merged the core qualities of Eleanor Roosevelt Leni Riefenstahl and Madonna herself. The way Alan Parker has directed Evita however its just a sluggish contradictory mess a drably ""realistic"" Latin-revolution music video driven by a soundtrack of mediocre 70s rock. The real challenge of making a movie out of Evita isnt that its all songs; its that the songs contain very little dramatic action. As Eva defies Argentinas strict Catholic-class-system hierarchy rising from illegitimate peasant to mistress of a traveling tango singer to dance-hall girl to high-fashion pinup model to radio and movie star Parker cobbles together scenes in the sluggishly dissociated Edward Scissorhands-goes-to-the-editing-table style of MTV circa 1984. There are really just three characters Eva Juan and a floating narrator named Che (Antonio Banderas who alone among the principals sings with defiant theatrical zest). Almost everything that happens is naggingly abstract. Eva becomes the controversial toast of Buenos Aires. The establishment disapproves of her relationship with Juan. Juan goes to jail is released after a popular uprising and gets elected president. Eva makes her celebrated Rainbow Tour of Europe. These arent scenes -- theyre concepts for scenes. Even an actor as supple as Pryce is stranded; his performance consists of little more than flashing a wily crocodile grin and in a ritually ""suave"" man-of-the-people gesture removing his sport coat. The shows signature theme the lugubrious anthem ""Dont Cry for Me Argentina"" might be the emblem of its muddled impersonality Its Eva crooning a tender love ballad to... the peasant masses. By the time we arrive at the centerpiece number ""A New Argentina"" the crowning irony of Evita -- that Eva champions the people by celebrating herself -- has been steamrolled. What the movie needed was a star who could put across the grand paradoxes of Eva Perons life through the sheer power of her personality. But Madonna astonishingly turns out not to be that star. She is one of the most vital pop performers of her time yet in this her ultimate bid for Hollywood respectability she neutralizes her most magnetic qualities the teasing eroticism the unashamed soul-force vulgarity. Nakedly desperate to be taken seriously as an actress Madonna plays Evita not as an imaginative extension of her own persona which is what the film all but cried out for but as a kind of ghostly sanctified Other passive ""refined"" not quite there. She drains the life out of herself and drains it out of Evita too.

The long-awaited screen version of the celebrated 1978 Andrew Lloyd Webber-Tim Rice musical emerges as a stunningly crafted objet dart that evokes serious viewer admiration more than passionate excitement. Director Alan Parker has done a dazzling job creating screen images to accompany the wall-to-wall music resulting in a musical fresco that is much closer to a sophisticated filmed opera than to any conventional tuner. Despite the celebrity of both the property and leading lady Madonna pics nature limits its intrinsic appeal to upscale culturally aware audiences the very public who attend legit theater so it will take a minor miracle fueled by top reviews for Disney to put ""Evita"" over with the general public. Creating an ""event"" aura via advance-booking exclusive-run launches in major cities looks like a smart way to start. Few films can boast such protracted or complicated gestation periods as this one. The original musical which bowed in London in 1978 and arrived in the U.S. the following year may have seemed like a screen natural with its three magnetic leading characters sweeping historical backdrop and quickly famous score but many mitigating factors intervened. Oliver Stone came closest to doing it previously with Meryl Streep in the lead and enough of his conception evidently remains for him to receive co-screenplay credit with Parker one of the few contempo directors with a sufficient affinity to the musical form to return to it repeatedly. Whatever one may think of ""Fame"" and ""Pink Floyd -- The Wall"" one can only admire the finesse and resourcefulness with which Parker has visualized ""Evita."" Just as Lloyd Webbers score cascades relentlessly from one number to the next with only the scarcest of spoken dialogue to interrupt them so do the burnished indelible images that combine to form a stylized highly dramatic portrait of the rise and demise of Eva Peron imperious beloved first lady of fascist Argentina in mid-century. Unavoidably putting one in mind of ""Citizen Kane"" at the outset Parker begins his heroines story in 1952 with the announcement of her death to an audience assembled to watch the sort of cheesy domestic melodrama in which Eva Duarte appeared during her career as an actress. This gambit not only frames the story and provides a link to the title characters personal past but makes the crucial connection between Evita and the masses the working class from which she came and where she always found her greatest support. This connection is continually stressed in the films often dialectical editing which is effective both in charting the seemingly irresistible rise of Juan Perons totalitarian regime in the mid-1940s and in offering ironic and critical illustrations to flesh out the commentary in the songs of Antonio Banderas Che character an ever-changing one-man Greek chorus who follows Evitas career from a distance. Opening reel may in fact be the most stupendous in the entire picture as it combines the news of Evitas death the banishment of the illegitimate young Eva from her fathers funeral in a dusty rural town the breathtaking spectacle of her state funeral procession through downtown Buenos Aires and Ches sardonic ""Oh What a Circus"" performed dynamically by Banderas in a bar. Story proper picks up in 1936 when 15-year-old Eva played even here by Madonna uses her liaison with an itinerant tango singer (the excellent Jimmy Nail) to make the move to the big city. A top tango club dance number in which Eva makes her way through numerous partners neatly establishes the attractive young womans modus operandi and the film deftly charts her single-minded rise from dance-hall girl and presumed prostitute to photographic model aspiring actress and mistress to the increasingly rich and powerful. Tale comes to a head in 1944 when Eva meets Juan Peron (Jonathan Pryce) a rising right-wing military officer. Eva quickly installs herself in Perons bed and increasingly as a source of inspiration and advice comes into her own as she uses a radio show to campaign on Perons behalf during his period of imprisonment. After his release the two are married Peron becomes president and Evita during a very brief career becomes one of the significant cult figures of the period mixing a regal highly coutured allure with an outward feigned humility and touch for common folk institutionalized in her philanthropic foundations. She died of cancer at 33. Evitas relationships with everyone and with no one moreso than her husband are defined by cold calculation and certainly the lack of emotion and intimate moments is among the principal factors that will make it most difficult for general audiences to connect with the events here. Indeed there is a constant push-pull dynamic between fascination and revulsion for the principal figures being swept up in the dramatic flow and being distanced from it and admiring the works disciplined focus and yearning for a larger cast of characters. By the final section as Evitas strength begins to ebb and Perons grip on power frays a bit the originality of the films approach starts fading somewhat as well. Along with the score which sinks into a trough of repetitiveness the visual coups lose their bloom of freshness as the picture pushes to two hours and beyond making Evitas climactic death rather less dramatic and not particularly more resonant the second time around. Finally the wall-of-sound approach achieves a distancing of its own as all the pre-recorded scenes largely devoid of ambient sound impart the same unreal feel. One comes to long for a little down time a few intimate moments amid all the spectacle and bombast no matter how impressive. And impressive it is. Parkers handling of crowd scenes is utterly masterful creating a pageant-like impression that is overwhelming at times and makes full use of one of the things films can do better than any other medium. The director has pulled together the crucial and diverse talents of cinematographer Darius Khondji production designer Brian Morris costume designer Penny Rose and choreographer Vincent Paterson as well as many others to create a film with the golden-brown luxuriant richness of the most exclusive private club. Exteriors in Argentina and Hungary have been integrated seamlessly. Quickly able to eliminate thoughts of the countless other professional parts her career has encompassed Madonna gives her all to the title role and pulls it off superbly. Dark-eyed intent and serious she conquers the character as Evita conquered every challenge she set for herself and if commentators wish to make their own parallels of this talent to the singer-actresss own career so be it. As the Everyman observer Banderas is ideal with the looks to set him apart from the crowd and a vocal conviction that proves highly agreeable. In fascist get-up and with icy malignant demeanor the impressive Pryce actually looks as much like Joseph Goebbels as he does Peron a resemblance that doesnt hurt at all under the circumstances.

Born into poverty Eva worked her way up a ladder of men then hitched her star to the military dictator to become the self-appointed spiritual leader of the nation. Her socialist rhetoric may have been at odds with her glamorous lifestyle but her death in 1952 caused an outpouring of grief. Is the musical still a credible genre in these cynical times? On the basis of this film the answers a qualified yes. Parker has no embarrassment when it comes to putting over a song and hes assembled a strong cast in Madonna Pryce (Peron) and a fiercely brow-beating Banderas as the ubiquitous narrator. Unfortunately for all its popularity on stage the Andrew Lloyd Webber/Tim Rice show makes an unlikely movie. Parker does his best to disguise the fact with extensive cross-cutting and plentiful crowd scenes but theres no real dynamic to the story no sense of movement. The film cries out for the liberation of choreography to supplement the thin repetitive score. An unholy cocktail of Emiliano Zapata Eva Braun and Princess Di Evitas politics are intriguing; presumably thats what attracted Parker and co-screenwriter Oliver Stone to the material but the movies so seriously weighty the bombast rather tips the balance against Evita charisma. Despite Madonnas impressive performance were never remotely tempted to cry for her - and in the end that must make the film a failure.

Starring Madonna Antonio Banderas and Jonathan Pryce. Music by Andrew Lloyd Webber. Written by Alan Parker and Oliver Stone after Tim Rices play. Directed by Alan Parker. (Rated PG. At the Regency I; at other area theaters January 10.) The protracted much-anticipated screen version of ""Evita"" turns out to have been worth the wait. Alan Parkers picture is epic lavish and fascinating. It is not a perfect screen musical but it is spectacular and it works. Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice the men who invented rock opera could not have imagined a better subject than the real Eva Duarte de Peron an ambitious material girl from the sticks who made it in show business moved on to politics and became a worshipped first lady a holy whore who behaved like a virgin. Evita lived fast died young and left a corpse so good-looking that it became an object of adoration years after her death in 1952. Lloyd Webber and Rice also could not have imagined Madonna. She was an unexpected gift. Madonna not anyones first choice for the coveted role was the real star who got the picture made and is most responsible for its success two decades after the musicals creation and half a century after Juan Perons election as Argentinas fascist president. ""Evita"" -- which began as a hit record ing that subsequently became a stage megasuccess around the world -- needed only to skate over the tricky politics of fascism to anticipate everything from rock videos to todays perverse fascination with celebrity. ""Evita"" anticipated Madonna. The movie begins like the play in a smoky Buenos Aires theater in 1952. Halfway through a B movie much like those that made Evitas early fame the film is interrupted and the audience is told that Eva Peron spiritual leader of the nation has just ""entered immortality"" at the age of 33. The scene is simple and unforgettable. It instantly signals a theme that Rices script develops insightfully Evas loving connec tion with the masses the peoples own attraction to false idols out of real need the seediness of the nations doomed affair with fascist populism. The tale is then told in music with dizzying speed from young Evas desperate first sexual conquest in 1936 to her move to Buenos Aires and her meeting Peron in 1944. The rest is history. Much of the musicals original power and exhilaration are gone. I especially miss the deadly game of musical chairs among Argentine generals in ""The Art of the Possible"" and there is probably no way that film could have captured the magic of ""Dont Cry for Me Argentina"" that Hal Princes stage direction wrought for his Evita Patti LuPone. Yet much is gained on film too. There is real star power in the roles of Evita Juan Peron and Che Madonna Jonathan Pryce and especially Antonio Banderas are incandescent. The delicious irony of Rices lyrics remains intact as does the freshness of Lloyd Webbers music. However the original scores endearingly British conflation of just about every Latin American rhythm except Argentinas own tango is glossed over in the motion picture -- first by John Mauceris languid conducting of the soundtrack and most of all by Vincent Patersons choreography. His dances are tailored to constant camera cuts and theyre dazzling. Less effective is what the frantic camera work does to Madonnas performance. As a modern-day Lola Montez who reinvents herself to anticipate the marketplaces whims Madonna is no fool. Evita could have been her most interesting creation. LOGIC OF ITS OWN True hers is a fabricated pop voice that in the best of circumstances lacks the bite and impact of LuPone or Elaine Paige. But throughout the picture Madonnas singing has a serenity that carries its own logic. Her glowing screen presence works beautifully in the pleading ""Id Be Surprisingly Good for You"" and especially in Rice and Lloyd Webbers new ""You Must Love Me"" -- a certain Oscar winner for best song. But in the big moments where the original ""Evita"" made history Parkers direction and Gerry Hamblings editing of Darius Khondjis cinematography dilute the power of the play and work against the integrity of Madonnas performance. One example among many is the sad mess made of the climactic balcony scene at the Casa Rosada when Evita sings ""Dont Cry for Me Argentina."" This was one of the defining moments in the musical theater of our time and Madonna should have had the chance to make it her own on film. Instead of letting the camera adore her and the audience just see her sing however Parker turns the moment into a rock video with more cuts than the shower scene in Hitchcocks ""Psycho."" There are flashbacks to the rest of Evitas life reaction shots of the crowd pans over everything from weapons to skirts and only occasionally snippets of Evita seducing the Argentine people with her sirens song. Madonna might have been great in this scene but the world will never know because her director chose not to trust her power to seduce us. Yet all the performances whenever the camera rests on them long enough are riveting. Banderas at last has been given a role in English that lets him rise to the heights of his considerable movie achievements in Spanish. His Che -- stripped of all the original roles iconography from the beard and cigar to the fatigues and the attitude -- is now a smoldering irresistible one-man chorus. His singing is sexy surprising and terrific. Pryce brilliant as the Eurasian Engineer in ""Miss Saigon"" is even better in what used to be a thankless role. Just to witness his Juan Peron come under Eva Duartes spell goes a long way toward explaining her ability to conquer an entire nation. Smaller roles are cast from strength particularly Jimmy Nail as Magaldi the first ladder in Evitas climb to the top. The specialty song ""On This Night of a Thousand Stars"" which always had a sort of Spandau Ballet faux-smarminess about it finds its ideal embodiment in Nails shameless impersonation. POLITICS OF EVITA The politics of the original ""Evita"" were eerily neutral in evoking double visions of icons of the right and the left Evita Peron and Che Guevara. The complexity was there but it was suggested rather than explained Rices book is Brecht without the signposts. The image of Juan Peron -- now stronger thanks to Pryces powerful portrayal -- remains the most enigmatic in ""Evita."" Just as Fidel Castro turned out to be Latin Americas low-budget Stalin Peron was its Mussolini. If the stage musicals moral neutrality comes off like so much moral confusion on film the peoples dark fascination with evil political forces still makes for electrifying images. And make no mistake the visual impact of this picture is electrifying. Although some will spot several Budapest landmarks passing for Buenos Aires the opulence and rich sepia tones of Khondjis cinematography add up to an evocative fantasy of lost times and exotic places that is in tune with Rice and Lloyd Webbers vision. ""Evita"" was never meant to be a lesson in Argentine history but it became one of the great musicals of all time anyway. If it is not now one of the great movie musicals it is close enough.

"Evita | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; evita ) Evita (United States 1996) A movie review by James Berardinelli As bold and dazzling a spectacle as Evita is its missing a soul. This brash glitzy energetic entertainment has the power to hold an audience enraptured but at the same time theres a sense that what were experiencing is just candy for the eyes and ears. In its own way Evita is much like this past summers blockbusters -- lots of flash and pizzazz but very little beneath the surface. Anyone expecting more than loud music and boisterous musical numbers will be disappointed. Evita even more than the stage show upon which it is based is light on characters and even lighter on historical facts. When it first hit Broadway in 1978 the play Evita was described as the most cinematic of Andrew Lloyd Webbers musicals. Despite that appellation it has taken nearly twenty years for the story to make the stage-to-screen transition. Along the way a number of well-known and highly respected directors including Francis Ford Coppola Richard Attenborough and most recently Oliver Stone (who receives a screenplay credit due to Writers Guild rules even though none of his script has been retained) have unsuccessfully tackled the project. Finally Alan Parker whose previous music-laden movie credits include Fame and The Commitments has completed the job using an unlikely cast that includes veteran actor Jonathan Pryce international heartthrob Antonio Banderas and of course Madonna in the title role. Only the bare facts of Evita Perons life have been retained for the film. As in the stage musical she is represented as an heroic figure -- sometimes vain and self-serving but rarely harsh or manipulative. This doesnt necessarily agree with the historical record but it makes for better cinema. Likewise Jonathan Pryces Juan Peron is played as far more amiable than the actual dictator who took control of Argentina during the mid-40s. Eva Duarte (or as she was better known Evita) was born in 1919 the bastard child of a man who perished when she was seven. Thirty-three years after her birth Evita then the wife of Argentinas President Juan Peron died of cancer. The film which opens with a flash forward to Evitas funeral takes us from the day in 1926 when she places flowers upon her fathers casket to the time when thousands of mourners file past her own still form. In between she uses an affair with a singer (Jimmy Nail) to enable a move from her familys rural home to Buenos Aires where she eventually becomes Perons wife. Once he takes over the country she attempts to apply her newfound power to the task of bettering the lot of Argentinas women and lower classes. Evita tells Evitas story almost entirely in song (spoken lines are few and far between) making it more of an opera than a traditional musical. There are several familiar tunes (most notably ""Dont Cry for Me Argentina"") but much of the dialogue is delivered in recitatives which occasionally seem awkward. Nevertheless in those instances when Evita reaches its musical stride with a full orchestra accompanying Madonnas strong clear voice this movie soars. Unfortunately in the end it always comes back to Earth. The production design is excellent as one would expect from such an ambitious project. From the streets of Buenos Aires to the interior of Perons house the films look is composed with near- perfect attention to detail. Crowd scenes -- and there are many -- are handled expertly. Madonnas numerous varied costumes add a further splash of color and style to a movie whose only serious fault lies in the shallowness of its narrative. We never learn more about Evitas characters than is absolutely necessary. They dont become either three-dimensional or especially sympathetic. Although Madonna is an excellent singer her emoting skills are limited. Theres little depth to her Evita and this robs the story of a portion of its power. The script is also surprisingly unambitious. Evita concentrates on the big musical numbers while virtually ignoring the sung connecting words that provide opportunities for character interaction and development. Jonathan Pryce (Brazil Carrington) who is certainly capable of giving a strong performance is wasted. Only towards the end is he given more to do than play second fiddle to Madonna. If theres a real surprise in Evita its the strength of Antonio Banderas performance. Playing a sort of one-man Greek chorus he fills the role of narrator with an impossible-to-miss sardonic quality. Banderas Che gives the film an edge and Evitas few negative qualities come to light through his numbers. Even though Banderas doesnt have Madonnas vocal ability he acquits himself well enough when it comes to singing and his acting is the best that its been since he parted ways with Pedro Almoldovar (after Tie Me Up Tie Me Down). A great deal has been written about whether Evita will be able to revive the musical genre especially when coupled with Woody Allens new effort Everyone Says I Love You. Obviously its impossible to give an answer now but if this film strikes box office gold (which seems possible with Disney plugging it so relentlessly) more musicals will follow. Hopefully anything in the works will combine the artistry and spectacle of Evita with a stronger story and better-defined characters. As it stands this is solid entertainment but the potential exists for something richer and more satisfying.

About a third of the way into Evita she gets her chance as Eva Duarte the future diva-saint of Argentina throws herself at Juan Peron the charismatic army general-turned-politician whos fast on his way to taking over the country. As the two retreat to Evas bedroom they sing the imploring duet ""Id Be Surprisingly Good for You."" Its the prettiest number weve heard so far if only because its wistful melody line makes more than a passing nod to ""Yesterday."" With the camera gliding around them Madonnas rapt powerstruck Eva stares at Jonathan Pryces wryly imperious Juan and begins to sing. Is she aflame with love seduced by Perons populist bravado? Or is she a visionary manipulator affixing herself to a rising star? Technically Madonnas singing is beautiful -- elegant silky refined. Yet theres no fire no twinkle of ambitious joy to her performance. Her face is fixed almost tranquilized -- a porcelain mask. Its hard to tell whats going on in her. Were watching the defining moment of Eva Perons life and it looks for all the world like an upscale champagne commercial. If theres a role Madonna seemed born to play it was Eva Peron -- or at least the sexy ruthless camp-myth Eva Peron at the center of Evita a musical that delights in holding up its heroine to the glitzy distorting mirror of showbiz. First produced on the London stage in 1978 (and then a year later on Broadway) Evita was ahead of its time in its chic fascination with fame with the power of glamour and with the once-novel idea of insatiable feminine ambition. Evita fashion-plat goddess of the proletariat Dead of cancer at 33 -- but really martyred by her pitiless drive Politics as superstardom Demagoguery as high kitsch It all looks more than a trifle old hat now. Still Evita could have worked had it been staged as larger-than-life spectacle. The film was once set to be made by Oliver Stone (he retains a coscreenwriting credit) and a director like Stone might have tapped the lurid grandstanding appeal of a musical whose heroine merged the core qualities of Eleanor Roosevelt Leni Riefenstahl and Madonna herself. The way Alan Parker has directed Evita however its just a sluggish contradictory mess a drably ""realistic"" Latin-revolution music video driven by a soundtrack of mediocre 70s rock. The real challenge of making a movie out of Evita isnt that its all songs; its that the songs contain very little dramatic action. As Eva defies Argentinas strict Catholic-class-system hierarchy rising from illegitimate peasant to mistress of a traveling tango singer to dance-hall girl to high-fashion pinup model to radio and movie star Parker cobbles together scenes in the sluggishly dissociated Edward Scissorhands-goes-to-the-editing-table style of MTV circa 1984. There are really just three characters Eva Juan and a floating narrator named Che (Antonio Banderas who alone among the principals sings with defiant theatrical zest). Almost everything that happens is naggingly abstract. Eva becomes the controversial toast of Buenos Aires. The establishment disapproves of her relationship with Juan. Juan goes to jail is released after a popular uprising and gets elected president. Eva makes her celebrated Rainbow Tour of Europe. These arent scenes -- theyre concepts for scenes. Even an actor as supple as Pryce is stranded; his performance consists of little more than flashing a wily crocodile grin and in a ritually ""suave"" man-of-the-people gesture removing his sport coat. The shows signature theme the lugubrious anthem ""Dont Cry for Me Argentina"" might be the emblem of its muddled impersonality Its Eva crooning a tender love ballad to... the peasant masses. By the time we arrive at the centerpiece number ""A New Argentina"" the crowning irony of Evita -- that Eva champions the people by celebrating herself -- has been steamrolled. What the movie needed was a star who could put across the grand paradoxes of Eva Perons life through the sheer power of her personality. But Madonna astonishingly turns out not to be that star. She is one of the most vital pop performers of her time yet in this her ultimate bid for Hollywood respectability she neutralizes her most magnetic qualities the teasing eroticism the unashamed soul-force vulgarity. Nakedly desperate to be taken seriously as an actress Madonna plays Evita not as an imaginative extension of her own persona which is what the film all but cried out for but as a kind of ghostly sanctified Other passive ""refined"" not quite there. She drains the life out of herself and drains it out of Evita too.
