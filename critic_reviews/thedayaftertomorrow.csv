But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

Yes in that Big Dumb Summer Fun way but not exactly something whose subtle flavors youre meant to savor or even analyze. Which kind of puts me in a bind considering what I do for a living. A swollen agglomeration of disaster-movie cliches brain-freezing special effects cheesy dialogue along the lines of ""Hold on Are you suggesting all these things could be related?"" and clumsy political commentary straight out of a ""Saturday Night Live"" skit this global-warming adventure -- which postulates the sudden arrival of a new ice age -- is nonetheless bracing in the manner of an ice cube down your shirt. Its the Weather Channel on steroids. True to the formula of the contemporary disaster flick """"The Day After Tomorrow"" wastes no time with such niceties as character development. People are introduced briefly -- such as heroic but unheeded ""paleoclimatologist"" Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) who has been saying that the sky is falling for some time now thanks to our cavalier disregard for the growing hole in the ozone layer -- and then the movie barrels right on past him his compassionate doctor wife Lucy (Sela Ward) and their genius son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal). After all weve got to get to Snow in New Delhi Grapefruit-size hail in Tokyo Tornadoes in Los Angeles Critical desalinization of the North Atlantic Current Say what? You heard me. Supposedly melting of the polar ice caps has led to an imbalance in the amounts of fresh and salt water in the ocean causing abrupt steep drops in water temperature and such atmospheric disturbances as huge hurricane-like storms powerful enough to suck down subarctic air from the troposphere. Warning Theres a lot of meteorological mumbo jumbo here which I suggest you allow to just wash over you. Resistance like comprehension is futile. But back to our story already in progress. The main tension of the film which jumps around the globe as Mother Nature tightens her icy grip on various noble but doomed supporting actors arises from the fact that Jack is in Washington D.C. where he has been trying to get an arrogant Dick Cheney-like vice president (Kenneth Welsh) and his figurehead George W. Bushesque boss (Perry King) to listen to him while Sam is trapped in a snowed-under and icebound Manhattan where he has holed up in the New York Public Library along with a bunch of other high-school science nerds in town for a whiz-kid competition and the few surviving New Yorkers Sam has managed to talk out of going out into the thousand-degrees-below-zero weather. Okay so its not that cold but its about to be. Dad of course sets out to rescue his son from the Big Frozen Apple first in what I can only assume is a four-wheel-drive vehicle and then when he runs into a house-size snowdrift outside Philly by foot. Look I never said the movie was plausible. Sam meanwhile is burning books to keep warm -- not the Gutenberg Bible thank you very much -- and contending with wolves that have escaped from the Central Park Zoo and a love interest (Emmy Rossum) with a soon-to-be-septic gash in her leg. All in a days work (more like a few weeks actually) for the boy brainiac who you will be happy to hear does not figure out how to reverse the effects of catastrophic climate change by detonating a nuclear bomb. Lucy stays behind in Washington to care for a sickly child whom we dont have time to discuss. Gotta move move move. ""The Day After Tomorrow"" is nothing if not fast paced which is a good thing when you consider that theres barely a minute to question all the plot holes. Where did Sam and company find all those powerful flashlights for instance? And why do they burn books before all the wooden furniture? There are moments of intentional humor as when the prez turns to the veep and asks ""What do you think we should do?"" During the screening I saw there were also unfortunately moments of unintended laughter as during the films meant-to-be stirring climax. Oh well. Still the films biggest joke comes when the vice president goes on national television to apologize for his advocacy of the rapacious depletion of the earths natural resources at the expense of our childrens future. Like thatll ever happen. Not in my lifetime pal. THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW (PG-13 123 minutes) -- Contains death destruction of personal property and one mild obscenity. Area theaters.

"The Day After Tomorrow is apocalyptic. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Day After Tomorrow is apocalyptic. The Day After Tomorrow is apocalyptic. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 27 2004 635 PM The Ice Age Cometh The Day After Tomorrow is full of hot gas. By David Edelstein Eco-soap opera gets a rinse The Day After Tomorrow (20th Century Fox) has one of the most absurd and implausible plot turns Ive seen in a movie ever. Global warming melts the polar ice caps which makes the oceans rise and disrupts the Gulf Stream. There are lethal hailstones in Tokyo and ravaging tornadoes in L.A.; and after New York City is flooded by seawater the temperature plunges at a rate of 10 degrees per second so that people are transformed into ice statues where they stand. Tens of millions are dead and the upper United States has become uninhabitable. Now heres the implausible part. The vice president (Kenneth Welsh)-- closely modeled on Dick Cheney --who has pooh-poohed all evidence of global warming goes on TV and says ""I was wrong."" Of course if I had to catalog all the moronic plot turns in The Day After Tomorrow wed be here until the next ice age. Its just so very bad. You can have a pretty good time snickering at it--unless like me you think theres something to this global warming thing and you shudder at the irony of a movie meant to warn people about a dangerous environmental trend that completely discredits it. Advertisement The first half hour is full of standard corny disaster-movie foreplay and its kind of fun to be five steps ahead of all the ""experts"" on screen. The paleoclimatologist hero (Dennis Quaid)--who warns the world that something like this is coming albeit not quite this fast--is introduced to Terry Rapson (Ian Holm) at a climate conference in New Delhi and exclaims ""Professor Rapson? Ive read your work on ocean currents"" I just love lines like that. Climatologists stare into their computer screens while munching on some piece of food and say ""Hmmm thats strange. The temperature at Georges Bank just dropped 13 degrees. Must be a broken sensor."" Idiot Hasnt he seen the previews? The filmmakers can get away with all the bum dialogue early on because were still in a state of happy anticipation Its a kind of therapy to see our fictional counterparts die in horrible ways our cities crumble our deepest anxieties realized. There are even a couple of chilling images like the one in which tens of thousands of birds take off from Manhattan in an evident panic. But the director of The Day After Tomorrow is Roland Emmerich the man responsible for three of the clunkiest summer blockbusters ever made Independence Day (1996) Godzilla (1998) and The Patriot (2000). Emmerich has said that audiences will show up to see killer special effects but what will keep them in their seats is the presence of recognizable human beings with recognizable human problems. I couldnt agree more--except that Emmerichs recognizable human problems make the ones on Days of Our Lives seem outre. And when it comes to weaving personal stories in and out of the special-effects set pieces the director has the most colossal antitalent since Ed Wood Jr. Everyone will have his or her favorite bad moment in this movie We could almost hold another contest. I almost lost it when someone yelled ""Its a wall of water coming toward New York City"" because thats the most laughable line in The Poseidon Adventure (1972) too. But my favorite is probably when Quaids teenage son (Jake Gyllenhaal who outgrew this sort of part years ago) nearly drowns in freezing ocean water to swim to a pay phone and call his parents. Advertisement In the midst of all the horror Emmerich wants us to care very deeply that Quaid prove to his son that hes not an absentee dad. So the paleoclimatologist announces that instead of helping the government draw up evacuation plans hes going to snowshoe from Washington D.C. to Manhattan to find Junior now holed up in the New York Public Library making cow eyes at Emmy Rossum. ""Your dad will never make it"" says someone and Gyllenhaal says ""Hell make it""--and its a testament to the actors smarts that he knows how to soft-pedal that line so that it doesnt bring down the house. (More suspense Will Gyllenhaal have the courage to tell Rossum that he uh likes her? While he makes up his mind the entire country of Scotland perishes in a deep freeze.) The Day After Tomorrow ends up feeling weirdly underpopulated because the scenes arent thought out in terms of the movement of the masses but the soap-opera tribulations of the few--each of whom gets his or her own little moment of heroism. Sela Ward as Quaids ex-wife is fer sher a pediatric oncologist who remains at the bedside of a little boy with no hair when her clinic empties out. Rossum risks flood waters to retrieve the passports of a mother and child and Gyllenhaal risks water cold and hungry wolves to get Rossum some penicillin. A homeless man taking refuge in the library rescues his dog. (Hmmm Many starving people one dog one roaring fire. No even thinks about un chien roti?) Never mind all this youre saying. How are the FX? Swell although at this point most of us can recognize computer-generated imagery and so we register on some level that its a computerized Antarctic ice sheet cracking and a computerized Hollywood sign being blown away by a computerized tornado. Its more of a problem that all the cool effects--the evisceration of L.A. the tidal waves sweeping past the Statue of Liberty the buses flying through the air--come relatively early. The last part of the movie is people and skyscrapers getting very very cold which is not all that photogenic--although Emmerich has Gyllenhaal being chased by an arctic chill as if its Godzilla. The sad part is that Emmerich really thinks hes making a political statement and he and his producers and actors are making the rounds blabbing about the movies message to the world. As a German hes no doubt eager to teach the United States some humility The most amusing scene features North Americans racing illegally across the Rio Grande as Mexican troops attempt to turn them back. But the mainstream American audience wont want to know from humility even in a fantasy alternate universe. Its too Jimmy Carter. Meanwhile global-warming experts I know are already girding themselves for a major PR setback as everyone involved in this catastrophe becomes a laughingstock. Is it possible that The Day After Tomorrow is a plot to make environmental activists look as wacko as antienvironmentalists always claim they are? Al Gore stepped right into this one didnt he?

Other links Search event listings Roland Emmerichs silly disaster flick ""The Day After Tomorrow"" may well be remembered for one thing only introducing the phrase ""unleashing the wolves"" to the lexicons of movie writers everywhere. Let me recap for you as straight-faced as I can OK so massive global warming has hit Manhattan with a vengeance resulting in tidal waves subsequent ice that reaches the tops of buildings subarctic temperatures and stray Russian freighters randomly sailing up Fifth Avenue. But our little band of survivors holed up in the arctic offices of the New York Public Library have even more problems to deal with. The requisite Girlfriend character Laura (wide-eyed Emmy Rossum) is suffering from blood poisoning contracted while saving an immigrants purse from a flooded taxi (dont ask) and penicillin is needed. So Sam the brave boy who loves her (Jake Gyllenhaal) -- who appears willing to go to any lengths to get a prom date -- quickly whips together a pair of snowshoes out of a stray rattan chair and goes stomping off to that Russian freighter with a few pals defying the supposedly fatal weather. Movie review Showtimes and trailer 1/2 ""The Day After Tomorrow"" with Dennis Quaid Jake Gyllenhaal Emmy Rossum Dash Mihok Ian Holm Sela Ward. Directed by Roland Emmerich from a screenplay by Emmerich and Jeffrey Nachmanoff. 123 minutes. Rated PG-13 for intense scenes of peril. Several theaters. And yes he finds that penicillin -- helpfully labeled ""penicillin"" in English -- and at this point you can see screenwriters Roland Emmerich and Jeffrey Nachmanoff scratching their heads. ""What next?"" they must have wondered. ""Wasnt that too easy? Shouldnt he be you know facing obstacles?"" Then one of them must have murmured the words that officially took this movie so far over the top you cant even see the top any more. ""Unleash the wolves."" So yes a pack of wolves turns up on this Russian freighter -- supposedly theyve escaped from the Central Park Zoo due to some global-warming-related oversight by their keepers and have strolled all the way down Fifth Avenue just to make life a little more difficult for Sam and his pals. While I can think of a number of movies that might benefit from a little wolf-unleashing (""Raising Helen"" for example) here its giggle-worthy overkill. ""The Day After Tomorrow"" prior to its release is getting much buzz from environmentalists and other groups wishing to raise awareness of global warming. Their cause is a worthy one but lets be careful not to mistake this goofy movie for science. Though it features some amazing special effects -- the shot of the Statue of Liberty standing armpit-deep in gray water is startlingly realistic -- much of it is off-the-wall silly. The frost for example moves so fast even young Sam has a hard time outrunning it. And Sams climatologist father (Dennis Quaid jaw clenched) walks from Philadelphia to Manhattan in the supposedly subarctic weather and arrives at the library looking fresh and perky. Emmerich whose previous forays into disaster (in every sense of the word) include ""Godzilla"" and ""Independence Day"" adds a political subtext to this blockbuster. (The all-too-powerful vice president in this film who initially denounces global warming as ""sensationalist claims"" looks uncannily like Dick Cheney.) The preview audience when it wasnt snickering applauded lines like ""You didnt want to hear about the science when it could have made a difference"" delivered to the films politicians. But ultimately ""The Day After Tomorrow"" is less about serious issues and more about big-money special effects and shameless sentimentality (theres even a little kid with cancer in the movie for no reason whatsoever). And in the midst of global disaster Sam and Laura find time to share a kiss so swoony and so romantically lit that you worry that theyre about to repopulate the species right there in the library. Where are those wolves when you need them?

Starring Dennis Quaid Jake Gyllenhaal Kenneth Welsh and Sela Ward. Directed by Roland Emmerich. (PG-13. 125 minutes. At Bay Areatheaters.) ""The Day After Tomorrow"" isnt satisfying in every way but in the ways that really matter its one superior disaster movie. It depicts the sudden onset of a new ice age with expertly constructed action sequences and special effects that are nothing less than awe-inspiring. The spectacle which is colossal and at times staggering to behold begins within two minutes of the fade-in and keeps coming until the finish. I thought Id seen it all. I hadnt. On the downside some of the dialogue is corny but you know what? No one goes to ""The Day After Tomorrow"" expecting a Noel Coward play. There are also some moments that are funny without anyone intending them to be and thats a bit of a problem. But the movie offers many other moments that are astonishing. Heres one Two men walk along the now-frozen body of water that divides Manhattan and Staten Island and they pass the Statue of Liberty now frozen over and buried waist deep in snow. Like everything else these days that shot was done on computer. But for once it doesnt look like it. Instead writer-director Roland Emmerich (""Independence Day"") takes an enormous compelling situation lays it out meticulously and lures viewers into his fantasy. Along the way ""The Day After Tomorrow"" even proves itself ambitious making a sincere if somewhat ham-fisted case that something needs to be done about global warming. Its rare to see a blockbuster take anything resembling a clear-cut political stand. As in every disaster movie ever made this one stars its Cassandra who knows the future warns everybody about it and in return gets treated like an eccentric crank. Dennis Quaid plays Jack a climatologist who realizes that something is very wrong when he notices an ice shelf cracking that should be frozen solid. At a government hearing he warns that the change in the Gulf Stream caused by global warming will eventually result in a dramatic decrease in temperature. But the vice president (Kenneth Welsh) interrupts him to criticize the Kyoto accords and dismisses him as a dreamer. But hes not dreaming. Soon scary stuff is happening Tornados in Hollywood. Ice chunks raining down from the heavens in Tokyo. Tsunamis in the Northeast. And seriously alarming turbulence for airline passengers. Since Emmerichs ""Independence Day"" there hasnt been a disaster movie on such a scale nor one so well executed or enjoyable. Though the movie depicts an international cataclysm the story mainly divides itself between the exploits of Jack in Washington D.C. and those of his son (Jake Gyllenhaal) who finds himself stranded inside Manhattans great Fifth Avenue library as conditions worsen and temperatures drop. Emmerich relies more on the personal in ""The Day After Tomorrow"" than he did in ""Independence Day"" the main reason the new movie is weaker in comparison. Yet its difficult to see how he had much of a choice. In ""The Day After Tomorrow "" theres no villain no enemy to fight and no obvious climax. When Jack decides he needs to go to New York to rescue his son the plot turn may seem faintly absurd (what will he do once he gets there?) but Emmerich obviously needed a story. Its good enough. Of course Quaid acts as though the story is considerably better than good enough. He acts as though he were in ""Macbeth"" playing Jack forcefully and with no irony. His straight-ahead seriousness may be slightly misplaced at times -- the script sometimes fails him -- but his commitment is still admirable and the movie benefits. Hes a rock. So is Sela Ward who approaches the role of his wife an oncologist with a similar if less intense gravity. Emmerich clearly did not want ""The Day After Tomorrow"" to be yet another smirky blockbuster. The movies politics will create some controversy. Emmerich is clearly pointing the finger at the current administration. His vice president a scowling cynic bears a slight resemblance to the real-life one while the president is portrayed as an unprepossessing fellow who stumbles up midway wearing a baseball cap and looking completely lost. Faced with a disaster in the making the best he can manage is to turn to the vice president and ask ""What should we do?"" Such moments will have Democrats rolling in the aisles but Republicans can also take pleasure in ""The Day After Tomorrow."" Though the storm is devastating anyone paying close attention will not fail to observe that it wreaks the most havoc on northern states and urban populations thus guaranteeing the GOP an electoral lock after the next census. -- Advisory This film contains scenes of chaos doom and destruction.

Well its all those things if you want it to be but basically its still a Roland Emmerich movie which tells you all you need to know. The director of ""Independence Day"" ""Godzilla"" and ""The Patriot"" has certain attributes all of which are given full vent in ""The Day After Tomorrow."" Hes crude stupid slick cornball predictable laughable relentless trivial and the sum of all these ridiculous. Hes never made a movie you could believe and he still hasnt. Ill leave the science to those who can spell ""science"" without a mnemonic device (""I before e except after c except in science. "") Considered purely as effects-driven filmed drama ""The Day After Tomorrow"" checks in somewhere in the middle of one of Hollywoods most absurd and least lamented dead genres the disaster pic of the 70s. Its a little better than ""Earthquake"" but not as good as ""The Towering Inferno"" because it doesnt star Steve McQueen and Paul Newman. Its only new trick is of course the use of computer-generated imagery. Thus when we watch buildings shredding disintegrating atomizing were not watching toy towns being deconstructed by industrial-strength GE fans in slo-mo. The details are richer and more nuanced the imagery far more -- but not entirely -- convincing. On a personal note Id like to add that building-shredding is infinitely more enjoyable when a big monster does it. Emmerich has a much deeper visual imagination than a dramatic one. He can conjure up utterly beguiling visions make you believe what you see is happening affect you profoundly by the poignancy of the image -- that tidal wave of angry black water swelling over then burying the Statue of Liberty for one. Then of course he utterly shatters the illusion with a trite plot banal dialogue clunky sentimentality and worst of all a sort of narrative arbitrariness by which hes shunting his paper-thin characters this way and that to shoehorn in as many effects as possible. Yet he either cant see or doesnt care about the staleness of the formulas he so ardently evokes. This film seems unusually Zen-pure in its mastery of basic movie cliche. Note how every character is shorn of dimension texture humanity and complexity and machined toward programmatic Oneness of existence. Our heroes A handsome concerned scientist (Dennis Quaid) his physician wife (Sela Ward) who takes care of dying children their misunderstood genius son (Jake Gyllenhaal) a charming homeless man (Glenn Plummer) with a cute dog a nerd (Arjay Smith) a preppie named J.D. (Austin Nichols) a pompous vice president (Cheney look-alike Kenneth Welsh) a loyal assistant (Jay O. Sanders) and a brilliant beautiful Asian female scientist (Tamlyn Tomita). These seamless holograms are beamed bloodless into a mob of extras whose specialty is the ability to look alarmed. Youve never seen so many furled brows wide eyes grim mouths and flared nostrils. Its like a Frodo Baggins look-alike contest. As the movie has it somehow global warming first melts the ice cap unleashing a tidal wave then -- here was the part I didnt quite get -- triggers a new ice age overnight. But the point isnt to argue climatology its to justify special effects. Emmerich gets to flood New York (this after blowing it up in ""Independence Day"" and wrecking it in ""Godzilla"") then flash-freeze it. So you get two entirely different scenarios of destruction for the price of one. You get to see the city trashed twice. And I havent even mentioned the tornadoes that rip through Los Angeles or the ice chunks that fall on Japan or the cold wave that drops planes and choppers out of the sky like falling cicadas. He loves to wreck stuff You can feel the love of craft lavished on the big sequences; the scene of a cluster of cyclones hip-hopping over the L.A. landscape buzz-sawing their way through the Hollywood sign sending buses flippity-flopping down the expressway is pretty astonishing but for the sheer scale of destruction nothing quite compares with that thunderous great wall of black water splishy-splashing Midtown. Somehow it stirs up primordial ancient-brain memories of the flood coming to cleanse the world of sin. Well thats another problem. Though the movie makes the nominally rational point that this is a worldwide disaster it focuses on America and it seems to take retributive joy in what it evokes. Were getting ours its saying. We thought we were so big so special so rich so untouchable. And now -- heh-heh -- were being punished. We deserved it. This is what you get for tail fins Elvis ""American Idol"" and all the other emblems of high-folk decadence so inflammatory to certain terminally indignant scolds. The movie takes special comic joy in a reverse-immigration scenario where gringos cross desperately into Mexico against the official importunings of the Mexican government. It loves the fact that the immediate consequence will be to reduce the United States to a Third World slum. And you can finally say this about the notion that everybody talks about the weather but nobody does anything about it Well Roland Emmerich has done something about it. Something stupid but still . . . something. The Day After Tomorrow (120 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for scenes of immense destruction.

Snow is falling in New Delhi tornadoes are engulfing L.A.s Capitol Records building and a ship floats in Manhattan. Tornadoes in Los Angeles? Only in Tomorrow. 20th Century Fox A new ice age is upon us in The Day After Tomorrow a title that reflects the time it probably will take for word-of-mouth to spread like halitosis over this movie. Oscar-caliber effects are fine but say what about script characterization and logic? Too packed in cardboard to be controversial this soap-boxer from Independence Days Roland Emmerich has been attacked for weeks by factions of the political right. And lets face it these folks wouldnt say anything good about a screen masterpiece about the perils of global warming even if reactionary columnist Ann Coulter were a romantic lead. Here between impressive panoramas of mass destruction we get Jake Gyllenhaal mooning for Mystic Rivers Emmy Rossum as theyre trapped in a New York library; suffering Sela Ward in a state over son Jakes fate; and Dennis Quaid (scowling again) as the scientist dad who foots it from Washington D.C. to New York in a blizzard to rescue Jake. ABOUT THE MOVIE The Day After Tomorrow   (out of four) Stars Dennis Quaid Jake Gyllenhaal Emmy Rossum Sela Ward Director Roland Emmerich Distributor 20th Century Fox Rating PG-13 for intense situations of peril. Opens Friday nationwide Rather than trying to explain in depth an underlying scientific thesis considered absurd by so many the movie wallows in subplots that the premises enormity renders minimal a protracted sick-child subplot that should have been scrapped and hoary dad-has-no-time-for-me sulks. After the destruction the drama flails with an hour still to go. A visit to the ship is forced to bring on marauding wolves. (Hey its a Fox picture; why not Alien?) Packed with digs at Bush-Cheney that even Democrats could find heavy-handed the movies lumbering approach reminds us that OK Emmerich did Independence Day -- but also 1998s Godzilla which began sinking back into the sea in week two.

Fox can expect very warm early summer B.O. Stateside and even better results internationally. A loose remake of ""Independence Day"" with weather as the villain rather than aliens ""The Day After Tomorrow"" is a disarmingly pulpy eye-popping disaster movie during its first half and an increasingly dull survival melodrama during its second. With the muscular assistance of some spectacular special effects depicting the devastation of New York and Los Angeles in particular this latest End of Western Civilization pop-culture artifact plays fast and loose with science and environmental theory to engineer a paranoid fantasy about global warming causing a new Ice Age. With media coverage already pushing ""Is this possible?"" angles Fox can expect very warm early summer B.O. Stateside and even better results internationally (where it opens imminently in 110 markets) for this old-fashioned mankind-vs.-the-elements speculative fiction epic. As demonstrated in most of his previous pics from ""Moon 44"" through ""Independence Day"" and ""Godzilla"" director Roland Emmerichs sensibilities and perhaps his heart as well reside in 50s-era B-movie sci-fi. His career-making trick has rested in taking cheesy material and elevating it just enough through casting and effects to reach contempo blockbuster proportions. His screenplays however rep little advance on those they emulate. And so it is with this new outing another doomsday scenario that in the manner it imagines global peril and paralysis at the sudden onset of temperature-plunging storms also recalls the more recent cycle of natural-disaster extravaganzas that included ""Twister"" ""Deep Impact"" and ""Armageddon."" After nearly floating away on a Rhode Island-sized block of ice that cracks off the Antarctic Shelf dashing climatologist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) startles a New Delhi environmental conference -- and pisses off the Dick Cheney-like U.S. vice president in attendance (Kenneth Welsh) -- with his ""sensationalist claims"" about the paradoxically frigid consequences of now-upon-us global warming. Lo and behold it starts snowing in Delhi and pics first reel surveys the inclement weather from Scotland and Japan to Washington D.C. and outer space where international astronauts can view the enormous storm systems beginning to spin down through the northern hemisphere. Although Tokyo gets popped by a torrent of giant hailstones first city to really take it on the chin is L.A. Hollywood and Vine is revisited by much better special effects than demolished it in ""Earthquake"" three decades back as multiple tornadoes convincingly lay waste to such landmarks as the Hollywood sign and the Capitol Records building. As Scottish ocean currents specialist Professor Terry Rapson (Ian Holm) charts the rapid decline in ocean temperatures and suggests melting ice is putting too much fresh water into the seas Hall comes under pressure to turn his theories into actual weather predictions. At the same time his bright teenage son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) decides to fly to New York for an academic decathlon arriving shortly before a wall of water hits Gotham. These scenes which begin with a tsunami all but engulfing the Statue of Liberty and then flooding Manhattan are perhaps the most impressive in the picture. The frequent aerial views of water surging through the streets are eerie and dramatically convincing and while some of the setups with people running and cars and busses flipping are virtually identical to those in ""Independence Day"" theres nothing in that film to match the shot that assumes the p.o.v. of a surfer atop a tidal wave as it surges through midtown. Pics action-packed first hour ends with Hall ominously predicting ""In seven to 10 days well be in a new Ice Age."" While there are some spectacular sights still in store notably the freezing-to-the-cracking-point of the Empire State Building and other structures second half quickly becomes a slog. On his fathers advice Sam remains sheltered in the 42nd Street main branch of the New York Public Library with a few friends which allows for a rote romance to develop between him and smart classmate Laura (Emmy Rossum). Halls doctor wife Lucy (Sela Ward) figures in scenes that are even more tedious as she remains behind at a hospital to care for a bedridden boy rather than remove herself from harms way. Most ludicrous of all Hall himself decides to don snow-trekking equipment and trudge through the snow all the way from Philadelphia to New York (in temperatures dropping by 10 degrees per minute) on the off-chance of locating and rescuing Sam. Unfortunately the long march is so unconvincing and dull to watch that it serves to chill pics excitement level at an equally precipitous rate just as it refocuses dramatic attention from the grandly global to the pallidly personal. Ultimate resolution to the overall crisis is disappointingly ho-hum. Still there are occasional little kicks to enjoy. Portrayal of the U.S. president (Perry King) is amusing; when confronted with the predicament he immediately turns to the VP and asks ""What do you think we should do?"" Better still is a subversive little plot twist that turns the historical immigration tables with millions of Americans fleeing the unendurable weather by busting through the closed border with Mexico. And when the U.S. president finally goes on television at the end to report on the state of the nation he does so on the Weather Channel. ""The Day After Tomorrow"" goes beyond the far-fetched into the preposterous but the first half delivers enough of what people want and expect from disaster pictures and there are enough money-shot special effects that auds probably will be more satisfied than not. Cast members have no special demands made upon them beyond looking concerned and alternately foolishly brave and coin was spent where it counts in putting some images onscreen that havent been seen before or at least havent been conveyed so convincingly. That should be enough. The Day After TomorrowProductionA 20th Century Fox release of a Centropolis Entertainment/Lions Gate/Mark Gordon Co. production. Produced by Gordon Roland Emmerich.

(CNN) -- Can you say cheese? Because thats what youll get when you buy a ticket to see ""The Day After Tomorrow."" Dont get me wrong Visually the film is stunning. The special effects are breathtaking. The huge vistas of New York City caught in the grip of a tidal wave followed by hundreds of feet of snow are remarkable. And yes this film with a reported budget of 125 million will have a huge opening weekend and will make millions of dollars. Too bad the plot is full of holes the story itself does not stay within its own reality and the dialogue is downright laughable. I know disaster flicks rarely make a whole lot of sense but this film seems to go out of its way to be stupid.Director Roland Emmerich is a master at conveying destruction and disaster on a grand scale. This is the man who brought us ""Independence Day"" (1996) and ""Godzilla"" (1998) and he does not disappoint on that level. But ultimately -- just like the aforementioned films -- ""The Day After Tomorrow"" lacks any real human emotion.Hell on earthDennis Quaid stars as Washington-based climatologist Jack Hall. His research shows that global warming could trigger a catastrophic shift in the worlds climate. Hes got a family not that its always apparent. Sela Ward has the unfortunate job of playing his wife Dr. Lucy Hall who is basically reduced to a couple of walk-on scenes. Jake Gyllenhaal fares better -- in terms of screen time -- as their 17-year-old son Sam who is trapped in New York when a huge super storm sweeps across the globe and all hell breaks loose.In the beginning Halls warnings fall on deaf ears. He and another scientist Rapson (Ian Holm) who is stationed in Scotland are the only ones in the world sounding an alarm. But then events start to happen that confirm their greatest fears. At this point common sense leaves the building. Despite snowstorms in New Delhi tornados destroying Los Angeles hail the size of baseballs falling on Tokyo Scotland becoming flash frozen the royal family evacuating England and New York drowning in a tidal wave the U.S. government still fails to act. Hall is reduced to pleading with the vice president in a Capitol Hill hallway where he is dismissed as only one man with an unproved theory.Say what? Screenwriting 101 says you cant set up an alternate reality -- completely impossible weather conditions killing millions of people -- and then proceed to completely violate that reality. In this case the ""reality"" is that the world is clearly falling apart as it teeters on the edge of another ice age and the vice president -- who seems to be really in charge of the country and looks a lot like a guy named Cheney -- ignores all these ""so-called"" facts in order to give the storyline fake dramatic tension. This is the point where ""The Day After Tomorrow"" becomes an amusement park ride rather than a film with any kind of even a semi-believable plot.Falling apartThere has been much ado about this film and what it has to say about actual global warming and climate change. Once again however it tanks. Towards the very end of the movie there are a few references to mankinds use of fossil fuels and how it affects the planet. But that little bit of breast-beating feels like some extra appendage stuck on at the last minute. In the end all the talk about the significance of this film is really a public relations stunt which has provided millions of dollars in free publicity. A tidal wave sweeps down Fifth Avenue in ""The Day After Tomorrow.""Meanwhile back to the plot such as it is. Sam and some school friends have taken refuge in the New York Public Library here they are burning books to stay warm and stay alive. At the last minute Sam is able to get through by phone to his father in D.C. and is told to stay put -- Dad is coming to the rescue. The rest of the film cuts back and forth between Sam and his friends and Jack -- who is fighting Arctic conditions on his way north to save his son. Most of the rest of the nation is being evacuated to Mexico a plot point that caused a lot of laughter in the theater Americans crashing the Mexican border instead of the other way around.By this point all you can do is sit back and let the amazing special effects wash over you while letting go of any hope for a coherent story. ""The Day After Tomorrow"" has all the markings of a major blockbuster but that doesnt necessarily make it worth your hard-earned bucks.""The Day After Tomorrow"" opens on Friday May 28 and is rated PG-13.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for 1.99 Review Perfect Man fatally flawed CNN/Money What TVs most popular dads earn Poll Most prefer to watch movies at home Cruise Holmes engaged to marryCNN/Money Security alert issued for 40 million credit cards Bin Laden deputy sends message U.S. House votes to keep U.N. dues Iran poll to go to run-off ALL AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE DC FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY International Edition Languages --------- Arabic German Japanese Korean Turkish CNN TV CNN International Headline News Transcripts Advertise With Us About Us SEARCH The Web CNN.com (c) 2005 Cable News Network LP LLLP.

"Day After Tomorrow The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; day-after-tomorrow-the ) Day After Tomorrow The (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli Roland Emmerich must dislike New York City. After all this is the third time he has destroyed it. The Day After Tomorrow an ode to an apocalyptic endgame of global warming is an old-fashioned disaster film with modern-day special effects. Its cheesy and over-the-top but the disaster sequences are well crafted and some of the formulaic action sequences generate tension. The Day After Tomorrow stands a rung above Independence Day (which self-destructed in its final third) and significantly more than that above the turgid Godzilla remake. The films premise - global warming leading to a radical climate shift and a new ice age - has caused scientists worldwide to flinch. Emmerich takes established facts and blows them out of proportion and itas the exaggeration that has caused the consternation in the scientific community. (Incidentally the Weather Channel apparently didnt have a problem with this since their logo is plastered all over the place.) But who expects realism from a movie like this anyway? The central disaster is just an excuse for the impressive effects work and the paper-thin character development. If it focuses some attention upon a real problem - global warming - then how can that be bad? Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) is a climatologist who has come to the conclusion that the world is fast approaching a new ice age. He estimates that the event will occur in 50 to 100 years - until he hooks up with British scientist Terry Rapson (Ian Holm) whose measurements of plummeting ocean temperatures in the North Atlantic advance and accelerate the time table significantly. Vice President Becker (Kenneth Walsh) ignores Jacks warnings leaving the country without a plan of defense when disaster happens. The 30 minute segment of The Day After Tomorrow that depicts the planets weather gone wild represents the films most compelling section. Tornados rip through Los Angeles even taking apart the ""Hollywood"" sign. Blizzards and hurricanes batter the Northern hemisphere. And New York City is flooded then frozen leaving skyscrapers and the Statue of Liberty as modern ice sculptures. The tornadoes look as good (or better) than those in Twister and the ravaging of Manhattan is believable although its not nearly as engaging a guilty pleasure as it would have been before 9/11/01. If youve seen the trailer you know what to expect but the full feature offers a lot more of the same. Jacks son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) is trapped in New York with his potential girlfriend Laura (Emmy Rossum) and a group of refugees. They are holed up in the library or at least thats what Sam tells Jack when he makes a last phone call. After kissing his wife Lucy (Sela Ward) goodbye Jack accompanied by a couple of buddies heads out into the unfriendly weather in search of Sam. Its a seemingly impossible trek that will involve a walk from Philadelphia to Manhattan in bitter blinding conditions. Some of what The Day After Tomorrow has to offer is exciting. Some is just plain stupid - like Sams tussle with a pack of wolves (on board a ship in the middle of Manhattan) Lucys act of self-sacrifice for a cancer patient and the Presidents pep talk (that sounds like it was lifted from Independence Day). Still a lot of the silliness is expected in this kind of motion picture and the moments of elevated adrenaline (many of which occur during Jacks harrowing journey) and impressive visuals serve as a counterbalance. Plus theres even a little irony thrown in for good measure when the Mexican government seals the border to keep U.S. refugees from fleeing south. The Day After Tomorrow has the good sense not to have man attempt to overcome natures wrath (the point of such films like Armageddon and The Core). Instead its a given that theres nothing we can do so the emphasis is on survival. The knowledge that victory is impossible makes for a more compelling story since the goal becomes intensely personal staying alive. Of course despite the ""bad science"" the pro-environment message shines through. Like Super Size Me consider it a cautionary tale. Nevertheless Emmerichs point with The Day After Tomorrow isnt to play politics or make speeches but to entertain. And in the cataclysmic way he has become known for he does so. The Day After Tomorrow is filled with bad dialogue stock peril situations and sketchy character development but its a big enough spectacle that those things dont derail the films capacity to be enjoyed. Pass the popcorn and the cheese. Day After Tomorrow The (United States 2004) Director Roland Emmerich Cast Dennis Quaid Tamlyn Tomita Austin Nichols Jay O.
