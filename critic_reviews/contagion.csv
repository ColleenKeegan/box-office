Its a sober engrossing thriller about the hysteria surrounding a worldwide epidemic of a disease that makes bird flu look like nappy rash. Moving from country to country with the vigour of the outbreak Steven Soderbergh (Traffic Oceans Eleven) extracts a strong ensemble effort from Matt Damon Kate Winslet Marion Cotillard Jude Law Gwyneth Paltrow and Laurence Fishburne none of whom outshine the real stars of the story rabid death and blind panic.The death of businesswoman Beth (Paltrow) on her return from Hong Kong sets alarm bells ringing - and the mortality rate soaring. Beths husband (Damon) is immune but desperate for his daughter to stay well and safe even as thugs loot shops and break into homes. As victims sweat ache foam at the mouth and expire World Heath Organisation employee Cotillard heads to Hong Kong but gets into local trouble - one of the films weak points. Winslet is an earnest Center for Disease Control and Prevention worker doing her best to help victims while her boss (Fishburne) fends off cries of conspiracy. Those cries come loudest from a Julian Assange-alike blogger played by Law with a laughable Aussie accent - presumably to underscore the Assange reference.Adopting a clean chronological and punchy approach Soderbergh holds a steady eye on panic and chaos. Its a disaster movie with a brain and conscience. The film plays slyly with our suspicions although theres a naivety to the epilogue that edges it into wishy-washy anti-globalisation territory and a couple of story-strand resolutions are more sappy than expected. Mostly though its level-headed energetic and enjoyable.

A good ensemble cast delivered great performances on the whole. I thought the film had a documentary feel as the cinematography and editing had a hyper-real/ ugly look to it. I know some plotlines may not have had a satisfactory conclusion but doesnt this also happen in real life? Do we always have happy well-rounded endings in the real world? Maybe that was the point. One flaw though was the Jude Law/ Julian Assange character. Did he really need to have an Aussie accent? I think the audience was capable of drawing the comparison without such obvious signposts.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 14 2011Ray CooperFeaturedThis is the kind of hollywood propaganda that consistently ran out of the nose of tinsletown in the Macarthey era only in 2011 Americas bogeyman isnt Russia anymore. What it tells you in its cynical B-picture with a budget trappings is Americas next great threat is China in fact the Chinese arent even to be trusted on a personal level also extra marital sex will kill you in three days even if youre Gwyneth Paltrow pre marital sex will also kill you and if youre wondering why Jude Law has a laughable Australian accent its because hes Julian Assange Who you shouldnt trust kids hes a bad man and he tells lies on the internet about poor honest hard working corporations financial institutions and governments. Bad bad man. All lies kids. Did we mention hes a liar? All this cynical propaganda could almost be forgiven if the film itself was spirited along with the sense of fun of many 1950s red scare b-movies but this has massively inflated ideas about the gravitas its bringing to the well worn end of the world genre and makes for dull seen it all before viewing that almost collapses under the weight of its too many cameos. You will probably enjoy this if you go to the cinema for the cuisine.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 12 2011scrumpyjackFeaturedWatched again to see if the first time id nodded off and dreamed it but no It REALLY is a big nothing of a film...frantically hopping from one story to the next as if we all now have the attention span of a gnat nothing feels finished and before you know it its day 13 26M have died we are told yet it feels like nouts even started.

Cottillard heading for Hong Kond and the hi-jacking side of the story didnt add any value to the story.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 2 2011Iain RobbFeaturedI think the one and two star reviews are harsh but this is one of those kinds of movie that will disappoint those who implicitly trust the critics who sometimes overrate a film when they cant put a finger on anything egregiously wrong with it. Its a decent enough movie that will be forgotten about the day after youve watched it. It has some interesting outdoors photography some decent acting some interesting moments also some boring moments very little character backstory and a criminally wasted Gwyneth Paltrow who hardly appears at all. The disease is completely uninteresting and theres no human involvement. When a main character dies you dont care. As apocalypse movies go it sits quite a few steps below Lars Triers spllbinding Melancholia and also has the misfortune to be released so soon after Perfect Sense which is a superior movie also with actually affecting human interest. Contagion is a quietly enjoyable but soulless film that has not been helped in audience appreciation by being so widely overrated. And its denoument is a copout; what could have been a revelatory moment is a brief aside telling us something we are already told about halfway through the film.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyOct 31 2011NickFeaturedDisaster movie turns slowly into movie disaster after promising start.

By David Denby Kate Winslet Matt Damon and Laurence Fishburne in Steven Soderberghs movie.   Credit Illustration by JORGE AREVALO Youre a school nurse who sends home a little boy flushed with fever; you reach into a bowl of peanuts at a bar; you pick up a cell phone left on a counter. It doesnt take much contact to become infected in ""Contagion"" Steven Soderberghs brilliant movie about the grimmest subject imaginable a pandemic that kills millions of people in a few months. ""Contagion"" is serious precise frightening emotionally enveloping. Its a highly controlled film about an out-of-control event a film so sure-handed and intelligent that it has an invigorating even an enlightening quality as if a blurred picture had suddenly come into focus. You leave the movie shaken but also at another level relieved since there isnt a grandstanding speech (except for one by a demagogue) or an instant of melodrama. ""Contagion"" confronts reality head on; its a brief against magical thinking. Soderbergh and his screenwriter Scott Z. Burns may not have intended it but their movie could become an event in an ongoing political debate over the nature of American life. ""Contagion"" moves with harrowing concentration and speed Beth Emhoff (Gwyneth Paltrow) who is in Hong Kong on a business trip has a night out in Kowloon where she eats a delicious-looking pork dish at a restaurant. On the way back home during a layover in Chicago she sleeps with an old boyfriend and then returns to her husband Mitch (Matt Damon) in Minneapolis where she suddenly becomes sick and dies. Was it encephalitis? Meningitis? At first no one realizes that a new flulike virus has killed her. From Hong Kong Chicago and Minneapolis the virus soon spreads everywhere. Only at the end of the movie do we find out how Beth got infected. (Earlier a researcher analyzing the viruss cell structure says ""The wrong pig met up with the wrong bat."") The scariest aspect of the story is that Beth wasnt traipsing around in the jungle; she was visiting one of the most cosmopolitan places in the world. In flashbacks to Hong Kong cued by security-camera footage we can see her smiling happily as after the restaurant dinner she spends a pleasant slightly drunken evening in a glittering casino during which this ordinary messing-around woman infects virtually everyone she comes into contact with. In ""Contagion"" paranoia reaches its logical end point the everyday streams of connection--the personal and professional meetings that make economic and social life and pleasure possible--become the vehicle of our destruction. In the movies one funny moment a teen-age boy and girl trying to spend some intimate time together are reduced to wriggling side by side in the snow; the boy finally rolls onto the girl for a kiss only to get roughly pulled off by her father. When kids cant even make out the world may truly be coming to an end. Formally and despite what Soderbergh has told interviewers the picture looks less like a disaster movie than like an international thriller. He and Burns jump all over the world in the fast-moving everything-happening-at-once style of the directors earlier triumph ""Traffic"" (though without the dirty excitement of that drug-trade movie). As in so many international thrillers dates and place-names are announced on the screen ""Day 5""; ""LONDON ENGLAND population 8.6 million."" For once this portentous device makes sense since the plague spreads geometrically and inexorably in time and space and we need to know the progress of the disease at any given moment. The movies tension-inducing techniques may be conventional but Soderbergh uses them better than anyone has in the recent past. The presence of movie stars helps their authority is part of what keeps us fascinated by the gruesome fable juicing it a bit so that we can actually enjoy it. At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta Dr. Ellis Cheever (Laurence Fishburne) the deputy director takes charge of tracking and fighting the disaster. Fishburne plays Cheever as an imposing (though fallible) man determined to remain calm no matter how awful the news; hes restrained and purposeful and the performance is effective but a little stolid. Cheever sends a medical-intelligence specialist Erin Mears (Kate Winslet) to the Minneapolis hot zone and Winslet working with more edge than Fishburne hardens her voice sets her face in a determined mask and captures the tone and the style of a professional woman exasperated by slowness and ignorance a woman almost masochistic in her scrupulous sense of duty. Meanwhile in a C.D.C. lab Dr. Ally Hextall (Jennifer Ehle) tries to isolate the virus and develop enough of it to create a serum. She wears a bulbous orange nylon protective garment and a clear plastic helmet. Despite this outlandish getup--she looks as if she were ready for a space walk on a planet made of candy--Ehle is perhaps the most appealing scientist in the history of the movies. She plays Hextall quietly and selflessly and her skill seems a function of her sensitivity. If this is a myth of science humanized by a female sensibility its a pleasing one. Without leaning too heavily on the obvious ""Contagion"" evokes memories of the bafflement and the sense of outrage and helplessness that greeted the H.I.V. and Ebola viruses in the nineteen-eighties and the swine-flu scare a few years back. Soderbergh could have pumped up the horror turning the material into a ""World of the Living Dead"" with disintegrating near-zombies lurching everywhere but doing the story straight makes it scarier than any amount of trashily morbid movie spectacle. What he gives us is terrifying enough people get sweaty and swell up and go into convulsions. Soderbergh shows us death a few times and then he and Burns move away from individual stories and broaden the picture. Again and again they drive in the nail with a single blow--a sardonic turn of phrase a pause a silence that allows us to draw our own conclusions. As panic engulfs the country civil society dissolves. Crowds assault banks and stores; people desperate for a cure attack pharmacies. The episodes are violent and appalling but mercifully brief. Soderbergh after fumbling through experiments like ""Full Frontal"" and ""The Girlfriend Experience"" and playing at satire in ""The Informant"" has recovered the mastery that he displayed in ""Traffic."" Everything in ""Contagion"" is staged with great physical conviction but without exaggeration--the tumult is neither overdone nor underdone. Shooting the movie himself (under the nom de camera Peter Andrews) Soderbergh keeps the palette generally dry. And the slyly malevolent editing by Stephen Mirrione is superb. Shots of seemingly innocent objects--a bus pole an empty glass both recently touched by an infected person--are held for just an instant longer than usual. ""Contagion"" mostly rushes ahead so when it slows a bit the effect is devastating as in a heartbreaking scene in which Damons character cant take in the fact that his wife is gone. The camera just stares and Damon has a great moment. The speed and the range of the movie are analogous to the way the disease spreads. The Internet another system of universal connection becomes a kind of plague too. ""Contagion"" has a wild card a soreheaded San Francisco blogger Alan Krumwiede played by Jude Law with a raspy voice and bad teeth. At first we dont know how to take Krumwiede. He complains online that the C.D.C. is ignoring an effective homeopathic cure and colluding with big pharma on a pseudo drug cure. He has ambiguous meetings with a hedge-fund guy. He could be a heroic truthteller--a populist champion--but he could be a rancorous loser too cloaking his personal chagrin in left-wing tirades. Krumwiedes aggressions echo those of 9/11 conspiracy theorists and perhaps of Julian Assange at his most self-righteous. As the filmmakers tell it Krumwiede spreading distrust is part of the disease. Until the end his motives remain a mystery. ""Contagion"" is of course a 9/11-anniversary movie though probably not one that the public was expecting. Soderbergh appears to be saying ""Ill show you something far worse than a terrorist attack and no fundamentalist fanatic planned it."" The film suggests that at any moment our advanced civilization could be close to a breakdown exacerbated by precisely what is most advanced in it. And the movie shows us something else heroic work by scientists and Homeland Security officials. We cant help noticing that with two exceptions--a French doctor who works for the World Health Organization (Marion Cotillard) and a renegade epidemiologist in San Francisco (Elliott Gould)--the heroes are all employees of the federal government and instinctively factual people. No one prays no one calls on God. ""Contagion"" lacks any spiritual dimension--except for its passionate belief in science and rational administration. The movie says When theres real trouble were in the hands of the reality-based community. No one else matters.  David Denby has been a staff writer and film critic at The New Yorker since 1998.

Pictures release. Photo Claudette Barius/?2011 Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. In Contagion Steven Soderbergh gets brusquely to the point the sound of a cough before thereas even an image then the sight of poor doomed Gwyneth Paltrow a Patient Zero a showing signs (red eyes dark circles phlegm) of the virus that will quickly finish her off. An onscreen title reads aDay 2a which is a good sick joke announcing thereall be none of the clunky expository foreplay youad get in something by Roland Emmerich who has a gift for juxtaposing two-bit soap-opera mawkishness and million-dollar CGI. Soderbergh is the anti-Emmerich He wonat even let Gwynny show off her long stems. Contagion which was written by Scott Z. Burns bumps along as if it had been pared down from an eight-hour mini-series to a lean unusually mean 90 minutes. There are fast montages of contact people in airports brushing past coughing on or handing money (another kind of virus) to one another Hong Kong infecting Chicago infecting Tokyo in seconds. New settings are introduced with the name of the city and the number of residents a i.e. the number of corpses that might soon line the streets the candidates for contagion. Contagion is compelling. The stars onboard might not get room to do much acting but youll feel a surge of confidence when broad-shouldered Laurence Fishburne strides into the Center for Disease Control epidemiologist Marion Cotillard moves purposefully through a Swiss airport Kate Winslet grits her teeth and gets busy setting up quarantine shelters Bryan Cranston sifts through evidence for signs of a national security breach Elliot Gould attempts to grow the all-devouring virus in situ so that a vaccine -- well Elliot Gould wouldnt be my first choice to play one of the worlds leading virologists. But hes terrific All the stars set their star egos aside and do yeoman service. And amid all the dry no-nonsense data exchanges theres a line worthy of the disaster-movie pantheon ""Somewhere in the world the wrong pig met up with the wrong bat."" Which explains the Kardashians but seriously folks ... Like much of Soderberghs recent work Contagion feels a little sterile more like a cinematic exercise than something with blood pumping through it. Its certainly high-minded -- it might be the most high-minded disaster movie ever made. The virus is both literal and metaphorical. Soderbergh uses genre conventions to portray a world at once too distant (human relations have broken down money sullies all) and too catastrophically close. Paltrow you see picked up the virus in Hong Kong working for a sinister-sounding international conglomerate and she spread it to Chicago by cheating on dog-loyal hubby Matt Damon. (Globalization destroys families cultures internal organs.) The Third World poor -- being closely bunched together and last in line for vaccinations -- die faster and in greater numbers. And wed all be better off if we didnt eat so much pork. But the real villain of Contagion isnt a pig or bat. Its a skuzzy skulking malcontent tech blogger (Jude Law) whos contacted (the epidemiological meaning works here too) by venture capitalists looking for ways to hit the motherlode while tens of millions perish. That accursed Internet Is there hope? Yes but it rests with the heroically selfless individual. Goulds scientist gets results -- but only by violating national-security protocol. So does researcher Jennifer Ehle (in the movies best role) whos driven to break the rules by a physician father who risked his life to treat the sick. Contagion is provocative but it might have been unspeakably moving if Soderbergh thought less like a clinician -- and a prig -- and more like ... well Chekhov the greatest of all doctor-dramatists who could recognize the person along with the physiological (and cultural) symptoms. Yes the bar is set high. But millions of people die in this film. Little kids suffer and perish onscreen. Its no time for cold clammy censure.

"Contagion | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; contagion ) Contagion (United States/UAE 2011) September 10 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Contagion is the best movie made to date about an epidemic/pandemic. By making the characters accessories to the story rather than the central focus the film is able to tell the story of the evolution of the disease without being encumbered by melodrama and artificially driven action sequences. The movie is neither thriller nor drama but somewhere in between. In fact it may be more procedural than anything else. With Contagion director Steven Soderbergh does for diseases what he previously accomplished for the drug trade with Traffic. The two are peas in a pod using slices of lives to illustrate how the central conceit impacts the human race. We are presented with the good the bad and the ugly with heroism and self-interest with altruism and desperation. Its compelling material and a far different experience than the more sensationalistic Outbreak. Contagion is chilling because it is credible. This is not the tale of an apocalypse in which the worlds population is reduced to a bunch of grungy survivors living in deserted cities nor is it about a zombie infestation. Instead its a clear-eyed view of what might happen in the event that such an epidemic should occur. Its speculative and a great deal of thought and real-world experience has been brought to bear on the story. This is a purely plot-driven motion picture; the characters are only loosely fleshed-out because their purpose is not to fuel the story but to illustrate different aspects of it. The disease is the main character and Contagion traces its life cycle. For Soderbergh this is his latest flirtation with the mainstream. Recently the filmmaker has been keeping a low-profile making small independent productions like The Girlfriend Experience. But he has never been above making films for the popcorn crowd - Erin Brockovich Oceans Eleven Oceans Twelve Oceans Thirteen being examples - and Contagion would at least on the surface seem to be an attractive multiplex option. Some may be a bit surprised by what the film offers however. The thing that obviously attracted Soderbergh to Scott Burns screenplay is the way it approaches familiar subject matter from an unconventional perspective. The star-studded cast might lead some to expect a Hollywood blockbuster but these are accomplished actors in unglamorous roles. Every one of the major players except Jennifer Ehle (whose career has been primarily on stage and on British TV) has been nominated for at least one acting Academy Award. Laurence Fishburne is Dr. Ellis Cheever the head of the CDC who becomes singled out as the fall guy when the epidemic spreads out of control. Kate Winslet is Dr. Erin Mears the no-nonsense doctor he dispatches to Minneapolis to report from the field. Jennifer Ehle is Dr. Ally Hextall the epidemiologist working in the lab to find a vaccination. Marion Cotillard is Dr. Leonora Orantes a World Health Organization sent to Hong Kong where it is believed the disease began its assault. Jude Law is Alan Krumwiede a rabble-rousing blogger with millions of followers who is trying to turn the epidemic into a money-making opportunity. Gwyneth Paltrow is Beth Emhoff Patient Zero. And Matt Damon is Mitch Emhoff her husband who appears to be immune to the disease. The passage of time is indicated by subtitles indicating ""Day 1"" ""Day 2"" ""Day 3"" and so forth. The exact period over which events occur is not specified but its approximately six months. Locations are marked with subtitles not only specifying the city but the population as well. This is perhaps the most ominous information to appear on-screen because the larger the number of people the greater the death toll. We are informed that the influenza epidemic of 1918 killed 1% of the population. In todays world with 6 billion people a similar rate would result in 60 million deaths. Contagion shows how the U.S. government and World Health Organization react to the situation once they realize its serious. As Dr. Mears and her colleagues identify the virus and attempt to replicate it in the lab Dr. Orantes uses security tapes and eyewitness accounts to identify Patient Zero in the hope of figuring out how the disease was transferred from bats to pigs to humans. Dr. Cheever holds news briefings but his credibility becomes compromised when it is discovered that he gave preferential treatment to his wife (notifying her that Chicago was about to be quarantined so she could get out). Mitch despite being immune himself doggedly pursues measures to keep his daughter who may not have inherited the quality safe. Dr. Mears risks her life by interacting with sick people as she sets up makeshift hospital wards in sports stadiums. Alan uses fear-mongering to manipulate the market. Economies collapse. The president goes to a ""safe location."" Riots erupt. But its not the end of the world. Its a pause. If theres a serious misstep in Contagion its that the subplot involving Alan is poorly focused. His motivation is murky. Initially he appears to be a conspiracy theory nutcase. Then hes a market manipulator being recruited by a hedge fund manager. Soderbergh wants him in the film to represent a slice of the population but doesnt seem to know how to manage him. Theres a sense that Alan should have been given either more or less screen time. The amount hes actually accorded doesnt seem just right. The literacy of Contagion may be its most impressive quality. This is as smart as a script about this subject could be and it has not been dumbed down for public consumption. The suspense comes not from wondering whether a character will die but from seeing how the human race will react to the next roadblock. Theres a lot of material covered here - arguably too much for a 105-minute movie with so many characters - but it gives a powerful perspective of what could be. And as you sit in a theater seat and watch events unfold on screen it offers great offers great comfort to recognize that the normalcy of the real world does not offer a threat like this. Yet.

Jones Jr_Jones CONTAGION  Directed by Steven Soderbergh ""Its an Irwin Allen movie"" director Steven Soderbergh recently told the New York Times in a story about his horrifying new thriller Contagion. ""Were doing exactly what he did using a lot of movie stars and trying to scare a lot of people."" Soderbergh was referring to the Hollywood producer who gave us the monster hits The Poseidon Adventure (1972) and The Towering Inferno (1974). Allen didnt really invent the disaster movie; that honor probably goes to Airport (1970) with Dean Martin trying to land a Boeing 707 thats been crippled by a terrorist bombing. But Allen did perfect the survivalist formula that propelled many disaster movies (and countless horror movies since) in which an assortment of characters band together under the leadership of one shrewd and decisive individual to escape from an enclosed space before time runs out. Like murder victims in an Agatha Christie play theyre picked off one by one and part of the fun is predicting who will make it out alive and who wont. The disaster movie has never really gone away but certainly its heyday was the 1970s an era so fraught with social and political chaos that the country often felt like a sinking ship or a burning skyscraper. Through the end of the decade Hollywood cranked out one spectacular crisis after another along with three Airport sequels there were Earthquake (1974) The Hindenburg (1975) Rollercoaster (1977) Avalanche (1978) Gray Lady Down (1978) Meteor (1979) and The China Syndrome (1979). Soderberghs movie arrives in a comparably bleak social climate yet in some respects Contagion--about a worldwide pandemic that ultimately kills 26 million people--differs dramatically from the Irwin Allen formula. Instead of banding together to reach the outside world Soderberghs characters pull away from each other in terror sealing themselves up in their homes in a spooky mirror image of our atomized online society. True to Soderberghs promise Contagion features plenty of stars Matt Damon Gwyneth Paltrow Kate Winslet Jude Law Laurence Fishburne Marion Cotillard Elliott Gould Jennifer Ehle John Hawkes--even comedian Demetri Martin turns up in a straight role as a medical researcher. Because the story deals with a pandemic youre never sure when one of these attractive people will start foaming at the mouth and flapping around like a fish out of water. Just as Alfred Hitchcock shocked viewers by killing off Janet Leigh in Psycho the first person to kick the bucket in Contagion is the glamorous Paltrow. Theres even a close-up of her blueish dead-eyed face as two autopsy surgeons saw off the top of her skull and fold the bloody flap of her scalp down over her forehead. ""Oh my God"" exclaims one of them inspecting her brain. (If I could look inside Gwyneth Paltrows head Id probably have the same reaction.) Along with the stars Contagion has plenty of scares though in contrast to Matt Damon and Kate Winslet theyre things you encounter every day. The movie opens with a black screen and on the sound track someone coughing. Again and again Soderbergh stresses the little things that communicate disease; after Paltrow leaves her seat at a bar the camera pans down to the glass dish of cocktail peanuts shes been sampling. When Dr. Sussman (Gould) a scientist whos studying the virus tries to relax by dining at a restaurant the sight of people congregating horrifies him every kiss every handshake every exchanged glass could mean death. A tight close-up of a finger pressing an elevator button registers with the same force as Leatherface swinging a chainsaw. Like most big-studio movies Contagion screened for the Chicago press only once and I knew that despite a vicious head cold Id have to show up if I wanted to write this review. I didnt feel guilty before the movie started but I sure as hell did afterward. The everyman hero of the movie is Mitch Emhoff (Damon) whos lucky enough to be naturally immune to the disease even though his wife (Paltrow) and little stepson die within hours of exposure. Mitch is a decent man but he doesnt have the chance to be Gene Hackman in The Poseidon Adventure or Paul Newman in The Towering Inferno; once hes released from quarantine he retreats with his teenage daughter to the safety of their home like almost everyone else in the world and waits it out. Many of the doctors at the Centers for Disease Control fall prey to selfishness or bureaucratic bickering. The only one who comes off particularly well is the selfless Dr. Mears (Winslet) whos sent into the field to investigate and perhaps inevitably contracts the disease (she dies on a cot in a triage ward characteristically trying to offer her jacket to the trembling man next to her). Meanwhile the president of the United States has been moved safely underground and members of Congress are staying at home and working online. Soderberghs treatment of the Internet turns out to be the most provocative aspect of Contagion. Like the virus which destroys any cell it encounters misinformation spreads rapidly online and tends to cancel out information that might save people. The movies only clear villain is Alan Krumwiede (Law) a cynical and opportunistic muckraking blogger. The more responsible characters treat him like a roach when he pitches a story about the burgeoning crisis to an editor at the San Francisco Chronicle she brushes him off and when he sticks a digital recorder in Dr. Sussmans face the scientist scurries away. (""Blogging is not writing"" Sussman tells him over his shoulder ""Its graffiti with punctuation."") After Krumwiede begins trumpeting the curative power of the herb forsythia his website takes off and before long he has 12 million unique visitors. But the herbs limited availability spurs rioting at overwhelmed pharmacies and Krumwiedes conspiracy theories about the government and Big Pharma dissuade some people from taking advantage of the official vaccine. Disaster movies have run the gamut of natural calamity fires earthquakes nuclear accidents asteroids hitting the planet you name it. But ultimately they all come down to issues of leadership and trust in The Poseidon Adventure Hackman manages to persuade a small group of people on an overturned ocean liner to follow him toward the engine room where they have a small chance of cutting through the ships hull rather than waiting in the upside-down ballroom to be rescued. Contagion is more alarming than anything Irwin Allen conjured up but that may have less to do with the movie itself than with the fact that in this era of mounting crisis both natural and man-made our leaders are too feckless to lead and the rest of us too cloistered to follow. Trust may be communicable but its not exactly contagious.

A feverish young man in Hong Kong stumbles back to his apartment to seek shelter in his girlfriends arms. A Japanese businessman collapses on a commuter bus mouth foaming as a fellow passenger records his ordeal on camera-phone. The human characters are largely bystanders to the wax and wane of the biological apocalypse. Much as he did with Traffic just over a decade ago director Steven Soderbergh hopscotches neatly between the intimate and international in his new film Contagion. But the trans-border affliction he is chasing this time around is at once more primitive and more complex than the drug trade its vectors beyond human will or restraint. A deadly virus soon to be named MEV-1 has leapt from bats to pigs to Homo sapiens and all of our sapien-hood is helpless before its lethal molecular ingenuity. The first to die is a woman in Minneapolis followed shortly by her son. (Be reassured the first 15 minutes of the film are the most brutal.) We watch as her husband evidently immune tries over the ensuing weeks to protect his daughter from the plague that lurks on the doorstep. Other characters are set in motion as well almost too many to catalog a World Health Organization official dispatched to China to determine where the virus originated; a doctor from the Centers for Disease Control tasked with containing the Midwestern outbreak; a CDC microbiologist hoping to unlock a vaccine; a muckraking blogger with an eye for pharmaceutical conspiracies; a litany of other physicians and epidemiologists and officials and loved ones and Dr. Sanjay Gupta as himself. And surrounding them all occasionally overlapping a relentlessly expanding universe of victims.

The cast Soderbergh has assembled for this multifarious endeavor could fill an Oscars-ceremony montage with stars to spare Kate Winslet Matt Damon Marion Cotillard Jude Law Gwyneth Paltrow and Laurence Fishburne. Elliott Gould is tucked away in there somewhere and for fans of the small screen Emmy monopolist Bryan Cranston. Their many less-famous castmates are comparably excellent in particular Jennifer Ehle daughter of Rosemary Harris best known for her turn as Elizabeth Bennet in the BBCs 1995 Pride and Prejudice. Working from a screenplay by Scott Z. Burns (The Bourne Ultimatum The Informant) Soderbergh guides his players through their intersecting trajectories deftly without recourse to contrived coincidence. Over the past ten years the director has experimented at virtually every point on the cinematic spectrum from inconspicuous indie (The Girlfriend Experience Bubble) to half-hearted mass-market (Oceans Eleven sequels) and its nice to see him again undertaking a project of such scope and ambition. Yet for all the human stories Soderbergh offers--the selflessness and selfishness on display the frenzied churn of lives within spitting (or coughing) distance of death--his true narrative arc is ultimately that of little MEV-1 from germination to conflagration to remission. Though at times Contagion takes the shape of a mystery as when researchers delve into the details of fomite transmission or study a casino surveillance video to determine their Patient Zero the clues uncovered are ultimately tangential (at least insofar as we see) to the epidemics resolution. With the exception of Ehles noble research scientist the human characters are largely bystanders to the wax and wane of the biological apocalypse. To his credit Soderbergh never descends to fatuous uplift or mawkish tragedy. (Even the films intrusive Tangerine Dream-y score is preferable to the swollen strings on which most directors would have relied.) Yet while the film is by no means unfeeling its wide lens gives it a somewhat impersonal almost clinical air. Much as it pains me to say it the movie could have used a firmer emotional and narrative rationale--a lesson even--beyond ""wash your hands often and hope youre lucky."" Lacking that the film resembles its viral subject a little too closely an intricate formidable mechanism with no evident purpose. For all the craft that went into it Contagion is ultimately beyond good or bad beyond criticism. It just is.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history.

He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Stephanie Loos/Reuters The Elusive Manipulative Adopted Child Tina Traster Learning how to bond with my daughter who found comfort in the familiarity of being alone has come through understanding reactive attachment disorder. My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day. Continue Reading carianoff/flickr Why Some People Respond to Stress by Falling Asleep Elijah Wolfson Fight or flight or sleep Last month my wife and I found ourselves in a disagreement about whether or not our apartment was clean enough for guests--the type of medium-sized disagreement that likely plagues all close relationships. In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

As Hurricane Katrina raged through New Orleans in 2005 neighborhood after neighborhood collapsed from flooding. Of the houses that stood many still had to be bulldozed due to mold within the walls. But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion. Continue Reading Charles Mostoller / Reuters Can Personality Be Changed? Scott Barry Kaufman Psychologists have long debated how flexible someones ""true"" self is. Almost everyone has something they want to change about their personality. In 2014 a study that traced peoples goals for personality change found that the vast majority of its subjects wanted to be more extraverted agreeable emotionally stable and open to new experiences. A whopping 97 percent said they wished they were more conscientious. These desires appeared to be rooted in dissatisfaction. People wanted to become more extraverted if they werent happy with their sex lives hobbies or friendships. They wanted to become more conscientious if they were displeased with their finances or schoolwork. The findings reflect the social psychologist Roy Baumeisters notion of ""crystallization of discontent"" Once people begin to recognize larger patterns of shortcomings in their lives he contends they may reshuffle their core values and priorities to justify improving things.

By Peter Rainer Film critic September 9 2011 Save for later Saved Blogger Alan Krumwiede (Jude Law) walks trash-strewn streets in search of proof that government and Big Pharma are hiding a homeopathic cure in Contagion. Warner Bros. Films          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Steven Soderberghs ""Contagion"" written by Scott Burns begins on a state of high alert and stays there for the rest of the movie. Returning home to her family in Minneapolis from business in Hong Kong Beth Emhoff (Gwyneth Paltrow) comes down with virulent symptoms that within two days leave her dead and doctors with no answers. Soon the contagion spreads into a global pandemic.This is not a movie for germaphobes. Its also not a movie for people who already have enough to worry about. So who does that leave exactly? As gripping as it often is ""Contagion"" isnt really much more in the end than a classy zombie movie. Its real-world bona fides give it an immediacy but the film essentially exists to put a fright in us.And that it does. As the incidents of infection mount up the contagion becomes a stand-in for everything from the Spanish flu epidemic to AIDS to SARS ad nauseam - not to mention weaponized biological warfare. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Soderbergh films much of the movie in a straight-ahead police procedural style but he is not above trying to gross us out (unnecessarily so I think) - as in the shot of Beths autopsy. (I expected Hannibal Lecter to slink into the frame.) Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? The pandemic explosion summons the usual suspects. At the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers try to break the code of the pathogen. (Beth is designated as Patient Zero - the initial carrier.) Deputy director Dr. Ellis Cheever (Laurence Fishburne) tries to balance out the public need for full disclosure while also avoiding a panic which of course inevitably ensues anyway. Pharmacies stores banks are pillaged. A renegade freelance blogger Alan Krumwiede (Jude Law) accuses government officials of colluding with Big Pharma to cover up a homeopathic cure. Alan who has his own smarmy agenda is a character to give radicals a bad name. He even has a snaggletooth.The best thing about ""Contagion"" is that in a few instances the people involved especially the researchers come across like human beings and not mere statistics. This is particularly true of Kate Winslets Dr. Erin Mears who is sent by Dr. Cheever into the feverish fray and Jennifer Ehles Dr. Ally Hextall who actually injects herself with a possible (and possibly fatal) vaccine. (This is yet another movie by the way following on the heels of ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" to feature monkeys as laboratory fodder. Chimpanzees should consider organizing a protest.)Winslet and Ehle are so intense that they cauterize the movies hokum. Less fortunate is Marion Cotillard whose role as a World Health Organization physician devolves into a Chinese yellow peril subplot.Also bereft is Elliott Gould who as a brainy Bay Area researcher who breaks the pathogens code is given far too little screen time. Matt Damon mired in the role of Beths woebegone husband does his best to be the films Everyman but its a thankless task.Despite all the scenes featuring high-level government officials yelling at each other despite all urban and suburban panic attacks the strongest moments in the movie are often the quietest. ""Contagion"" picks up on how we might all treat one another if even the slightest touch could mean death. The irony of this film is that its all about how we need to come together to conquer a calamity that pushes us apart. Grade B (Rated PG-13 for disturbing content and some language.)

Oh no not Gwyneth Paltrow Jude Law youre looking a little peaked. Kate Winslet too? Oh the humanity.Theyre all caught up in a low-key international panic involving the Centers for Disease Control (whats up Laurence Fishburne) international doctors (including Marion Cotillard) a paranoid blogger (Law) an average Joe (Matt Damon) and many others. The star wattage of Contagion as the kids might say is sick.Soderbergh knows his way around a sprawling tapestry of people and policy as he showed in his masterpiece Traffic. But Contagion which was written by Scott Z. Burns (Soderberghs collaborator on The Informant) feels a little too cool for school. In peeling away the histrionics that often mark depictions of widespread panic Soderbergh drains Contagion of the passion needed to feel the high stakes of a massive outbreak or to care about the victims.Soderbergh shot Contagion himself using digital cameras that create a hyperclarity of image that matches the storys flatness. Even when panicked Americans riot in a pharmacy to procure the last doses of a possible vaccine they seem to act out of obligation rather than urgency.Every time we jump to another country -- the virus originates in Hong Kong and makes tracks quickly -- we get little red letters at the bottom of the screen to update the location and count the days of life under virus. Contagion appropriately enough feels clinical too much so to become particularly scary. (That said I did wash my hands as soon as I left the theater.)Sometimes the coldness rises to the level of subtlety. Shots of uncollected trash lining a deserted hilly San Francisco street have a sort of permanence about them suggesting a threat that plans to stick around a while. A nifty montage at the end of the film tracks the viruss origins with supreme economy. The script has its share of inspired moments ""If neither of us have it then neither of us can give it to each other"" explains one teen lover to another in a tone that could be used for multiple occasions and afflictions.Theres no doubting Soderberghs craft or skill. Contagion just feels like the work of a bored filmmaker moving characters around like pieces on a game board. Then again hes never cared a whole lot about matching anyones expectations but his own. He has hinted that he may step away from filmmaking to pursue painting for a while; maybe hell return with batteries recharged. This time out his disengagement is infectious.On Twitter chrisvognarContagionC+Starring Matt Damon Kate Winslet Jude Law Laurence Fishburne Gwyneth Paltrow Marion Cotillard Bryan Cranston Jennifer Ehle Chin Han and Elliott Gould.

R. 1 hour 46 minutes. At area theaters. Youve got to love a thriller that opens on ""Day 2"" of a deadly pandemic. At least we hoped to. Instead that start is one of the few interesting things that happens in ""Contagion."" Steven Soderberghs viral ""who brung it"" is a mostly style-over-substance affair. Which was fine for the directors ""Oceans"" romps -- ""Eleven"" ""Twelve"" and ""Thirteen"" -- but that turns troubling in a movie that takes on the weightier matters of public health global travel the bleeding of the Fourth Estate the impact of unedited blogosphere chatter and more. Returning from a business trip in Asia Beth Emhoff (Gwyneth Paltrow) looks increasingly peaked as she waits in an airport lounge for a connecting flight to Minneapolis where she lives with her solicitous husband and young son. Beth isnt the only one with a crashing headache and fever. Theres a young man in Hong Kong a Ukrainian model in London a Japanese businessman in Tokyo. Each new dateline comes with a population lesson because this virus has an impressive secondary infection rate. There are 3.3 million people in Minneapolis. Who knew? The filmmakers take germophobe delight in focusing on every point of contact that the unknowing infected have with objects others will touch the drinking glasses the peanuts at a bar the doorknobs the bus handles. No surface is safe in this surface-y thriller. Matt Damon sporting a little chin hair portrays Beths mate Mitch. When she has a seizure he rushes her to the hospital only to find himself quarantined. Wondering what made all these pretty people so lethally ill? Youre not alone. The World Heath Organizations Dr. Leonora Orantes (Marion Cotillard) is concerned. So is Dr. Ellis Cheever (Laurence Fishburne) honcho at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. And phew Homeland Security is on the case. Kate Winslet portrays the CDCs Dr. Erin Mears sent to Minnesota to diagnose and contain. Scott Z. Burns script immediately burdens the good doc with a dyspeptic bureaucrat whos all about the bottom line and is still smarting from the H1N1 scare. The movies marketing tagline is ""Nothing Spreads Like Fear."" But ""Contagion"" wants to have it both ways. Which is it? Is hypervigilance the problem? Or is a mutating virus the problem? In whipping up and depicting the ensuing panic the movie gives short shrift to the loss and grief that accompany the catastrophe. ""Contagion"" is not the bridge between summers slight movies and falls more serious fare that wed hoped. Thanks goodness then for Jennifer Ehle who portrays CDC researcher Ally Hextall. You may recognize her as Myrtle Logue from ""The Kings Speech."" But if you dont that might be what makes her more effective than her better-known counterparts. She also has the best line in the movie -- which were there more wed give away. She makes credible the dire predictions and epidemiological patois the other actors are self-consciously spouting. Jude Law portrays Alan Krumwiede. With itchy energy and a mouth in need of dental work the investigative blogger realizes theres a pandemic before the other media. Is he the 2.0 version of the old and honorable muckraker or do 12 million unique hits corrupt absolutely? Packed with Oscar owners and nominees the movie is reminiscent of one of those star-laden disaster flicks of the 1970s. Only none of these actors are past their primes a testament to the pull Soderbergh has with performers. Another draw might have been that ""Contagion"" affords A-listers a chance to practice death scenes. There are a couple of doozies. So you may not want to get too attached to any of the characters. The movie certainly doesnt.

In a movie with so many fast-moving parts A- and B-plus-list actors Matt Damon Kate Winslet Gwyneth Paltrow Laurence Fishburne Jude Law and Bryan Cranston are around to make it easier for us to remember whos who. Except that Contagion isnt meant to provide delicious roller-coaster chills. Released two days before the 10th anniversary of 9/11 its a film meant to scare the bejesus out of us. And the movie moves faster than any carnival ride youd dare step on. Soderbergh accentuates the mood of galloping panic by interweaving plots at a breakneck pace racing between scenes and telling some stories in montage sequences. He also provides an agitated soundscape from former Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Cliff Martinez - fingernail-chewing music. Apart from the bereft suburban father (Matt Damon) and his quest to keep his remaining family together in the face of roving gun-toting vigilantes Contagion follows unsentimental professionals dealing with the implications and logistics of a plague that could kill everyone. Their banter is flavourful and droll. ""Any way someone could weapon the bird flu? Is that what were looking at?"" a nervous U.S. Homeland Security official asks the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) commander Dr. Cheever (Fishburne). ""Someone doesnt have to weapon the bird flu; the birds are doing that"" deadpans the unblinking doctor. Sly topical jokes emerge. During a mass civic funeral instead of listening to a politicians pious speech we eavesdrop on bored members of a clean-up crew grousing about equipment shortages. Apparently the American government wont allow its cities to order body bags from Canada. Its the dark comic moments and the films sci-fi B-movie race-to-develop-a-vaccine subplot that prevent Contagion from being a gloomy two hours in the dark. That and Soderberghs delight in characters. Fishburne is wonderfully cool and watchable as the unflappable CDC commander. More interesting and fun is Jude Law playing a muckraking Internet blogger with Fleet Street instincts and a Cockney accent. (He actually uses the word ""crikey"" at one point.) Laws character hopes to subvert the governments response to the spreading virus thereby increasing his following on Twitter. In another one of Contagions precious little jokes - a poke at the British dental system - Laws front teeth appear to grow bigger (like Pinocchios nose) as his character tells bigger and more devious lies. Earlier this year Soderbergh announced on National Public Radio his intention to retire a couple of movies from now. He wants to become a painter he says. Thats bad news for film fans. Moviegoers will miss anyone who can scare the hell out of us and make us laugh at the same time. Special to The Globe and Mail Contagion Directed by Steven Soderbergh Written by Scott Z.

Steven Soderberghs Contagion reviewed A global pandemic wreaks havoc on Oscar winners. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Sept. 9 2011 1053 AM Steven Soderberghs Contagion A global pandemic wreaks havoc on Oscar winners. By Forrest Wickman Contagion Steven Soderberghs new disaster movie Contagion (Warner Bros.) about a global pandemic that wreaks havoc on Oscar winners may be the worlds most masterly Purell advertisement. Youre likely to think twice about grabbing the theater-door handle on your way out and I can confess that one viewer found himself wondering whether he did in fact feel a disconcerting tightness in his throat. An early sequence depicting the spread of the virus (""The average person touches their face three to five times every waking minute"" an expert claims) is enough to make you want to go all Howard Hughes. Whether this alarm is justified is a topic best left for a separate debate but one thing is certain about Soderberghs latest Its a damn effective thriller. Opening with a cough over a black screen and fading in with a title reading ""Day 2"" Contagion takes off in medias res and doesnt relent. The cougher we soon learn is Beth Emhoff (Gwyneth Paltrow) whos just returned from Hong Kong with a carry-on supervirus. As in the closing credits of another recent and effective thriller Rise of the Planet of the Apes the deadly virus soon begins racking up frequent flyer miles and a wordless globe-trotting montage swiftly establishes the bird-flu-like disease as a worldwide killer. Activated to fight the plagues spread are battle-tested CDC director Ellis Cheever (Laurence Fishburne) Cheevers determined field operative Erin Mears (Kate Winslet) and World Health Organization investigator Leonora Orantes (Marion Cotillard). Meanwhile Mitch Emhoff (Matt Damon) boards up his house against infection a collapsing society and (in the films most touchy-feely subplot) his daughters incorrigible boyfriend. Advertisement If this sounds like a lot of characters already I havent even mentioned the fringe blogger (a lovely-to-hate Jude Law) the vaccine hunters (a standout Jennifer Ehle and a dead-in-the-face Demetri Martin) or the virologist played with scene-stealing puckishness by Elliott Gould. But Soderbergh often displays the height of his powers when orchestrating ensemble casts and Contagion is no exception. While several of these actors are able to imbue just one or two lines with a whole character Damon is particularly affecting--beneath the latest in a series of terrible haircuts he provides the films relatable heart. (In the scenes where he talks with his daughter played by promising debut actress Anna Jacoby-Heron you may find that the tightening in your throat isnt just the lethal virus.) Kate Winslet is restrained but lives up to her head-of-the-class reputation even in an unusually small role. Traffic employed a network narrative (think Babel Magnolia Crash) to demonstrate the human cost of the drug war but in Contagion the network forms the narrative itself. Not only does our globalized world provide the web to spread a pandemic in days but our technologies (Roger Eberts preferred term for network narratives is ""hyperlink movies"") allow information to spread just as virally and with just as little vetting. Thankfully Contagion adopts multiple views on this too (blogging fares poorly; social media a little better; and a texted emoticon has surprising heft) and shows how the official message can be just as narrow and unsatisfying as the hearsay spread by Facebook. While the movie never rises to the level of allegory its these zeitgeisty touches that make Contagion worthwhile in a genre thats already seen such serviceable predecessors as Outbreak and The Andromeda Strain. Forrest Wickman Forrest Wickman is a Slate senior editor. He writes and edits for Slates culture blog Brow Beat. Soderbergh has lately become something of the Brett Favre of American auteurs Hes always threatening to retire. But Contagion makes a strong case that he should stay. Contagions highly visual storytelling shows a love of cinema in nearly every frame from the Traffic-like crafting of different color schemes for each hot zone to the crisp state-of-the-art digital cinematography to Stephen Mirriones masterclass editing. (If anyone deserves an Oscar nod its Mirrione.) Another returning longtime collaborator of Soderberghs is Cliff Martinez whose propulsive electronic score is reminiscent of the recent work of another former rocker Trent Reznor and is almost as forceful. If Contagion is a ""horror movie"" as Soderbergh has described it then you can think of it as the most believable zombie movie ever made. A dangerous new infection breaks out is passed from dying victim to dying victim and the distrust it engenders sends society from state of emergency to state of nature. Through sign of the times touches A-grade acting and a mostly cliche-immune script (though the genres signature dead-monkey-in-a-cage shot does appear) Contagion elevates that well-trodden territory into something that feels both truly scary and fiercely contemporary. Its a bleak ride but in the end Contagion finally asks us to reach out to one another across the distrust and no matter the divide--as long as we wash our hands first.

Its the type of experience much like Outbreak and The Hot Zone were before it that makes one consider a hermit-like existence. Director Steven Soderbergh moves things along competently the acting is there and the themes presented are relevant and vital. So what factor undercuts Contagion? The humanity oh the humanity. Or rather the lack thereof. Like a tropical disease this is a film that could have used a bit more warmth to connect. Gwyneth Paltrows character is on a work assignment in Hong Kong. She heads out for a night of gallivanting as one does and unwittingly exposes herself to a nasty virus. This new virus is a result of bad luck and happenstance. As Snoop Dogg would tell you this is the sort of thing happens all the time. She stops in Chicago for a layover but she LEAVES THE AIRPORT (emphasis added by the film itself). She comes into contact with around a zillion people give or take. She gets pretty sick heads home to her husband (Matt Damon) and the kids in Minneapolis and then is checked into the hospital suffering from seizures. Its not good times. Something is afoot. Everyone wash your hands Cut to the CDC in Atlanta Georgia. These are the brave scientists protecting us from catastrophic pandemics. Kate Winslet and Laurence Fishburne start inspecting the first few cases of Paltrows sickness ... and they are none too pleased by what they see. Winslet is dispatched to Minnesota (Land of 10000 Lakes) to try and contain the madness. But this is an illness that wont be contained. Enter Jude Law as the hard-charging (though conspiracy prone) Internet reporter just the sort of fellow who would gain prominence during an international disaster. Thematically Contagion resonates. Where it slips (and eventually falls) is the massive scope. Months are missing from the plot and a major logic flaw involving a kidnapping is presented. Its difficult to orient oneself to the state of the world at any given moment though Contagion clearly wants you thinking globally. Finally theres an overarching lack of humanity in a film about a legitimate threat to civilization. Relationships are sort of hinted at but their depth is completely glossed over and nothing has any impact. Contagion is a clinical film to its detriment covering everything that could go wrong in a pandemic without successfully measuring the emotional toll. Contagion wants us witness to every part of the process but a film like 2012 with its myopic focus strangely makes more sense. Still Contagion is a film worth seeing in the theater if only to place yourself in the ""what would I do?"" imagination station. If the movie hadnt been so detached we very well could have been looking at a Best Picture contender but as it stands its at least worth the price of admission. Contagion never really gets there but it gives a reasonable effort. Good enough for a Friday night or a Sunday afternoon but not quite ready for the bright lights.

Starring Matt Damon Gwyneth Paltrow Jude Law Kate Winslet Laurence Fishburne Marion Cotillard Bryan Cranston Sanaa Lathan Jennifer Ehle Director Steven Soderbergh Running time 145 Release Opened Sep 9 2011  Editorial Review Injecting some life in a viral disasterBy Michael OSullivanFriday Sep 09 2011""Contagion"" a thinking mans horror movie about a viral pandemic from the writing-directing team of Steven Soderbergh and Scott Z. Burns (""The Informant"") plays less like a conventional medical thriller - think ""Outbreak"" - than like a dramatic reading of a ""Nova"" episode performed by Hollywoods elite. Its stuffed with A-list actors - Gwyneth Paltrow Matt Damon Kate Winslet Laurence Fishburne Marion Cotillard Jude Law Elliott Gould - running around frowning and spitting out terms like ""pathognomonic"" ""fomites"" ""paramyxovirus"" ""phylogenetic"" and ""R-naught number."" A few of them are defined; most are not. Thats the scariest thing about ""Contagion."" We never know exactly what it is were supposed to be afraid of as one character notes early in the film. Then again thats not entirely true. Based on Soderberghs shooting style in the films first few seconds which include ominously tight close-ups of a hand on a bus pole and a bowl of cocktail peanuts in a bar its anything and everything that we come in contact with thats terrifying. Ill guarantee you one thing Before this movie is over you will stop unconsciously touching your face (or if youre a critic sticking your pen in your mouth). What ""Psycho"" did for showers ""Contagion"" aims to do for shaking hands and shared water glasses. Otherwise ""Contagion"" is not all that disturbing except perhaps on an intellectual level. Thats partly due to Soderberghs restraint. The script which is reportedly based on solid scientific research about disease and its transmission treatment and control is admirably unsensationalistic. And thats even considering the fact that the virus at the heart of the story - dubbed MEV-1 though what that stands for is never explained - has a shorter and more lethal incubation period than anything weve previously seen. (SARS swine flu H1N1 - ""Contagion"" drops the names of real-life medical scares like mad.) Paltrow whose Beth Emhoff is the first to come down with the new disease is dead mere minutes into the movie after lapsing into a scary mouth-frothing seizure. ""Oh my God"" says the coroner upon opening up her skull and seeing whats inside ""should I call someone?"" ""Call everyone"" replies his frightened colleague. Hundreds of millions of victims follow though Beths husband Mitch played by a schlubby-looking Matt Damon remains immune both from the bug and from our emotions. As a hero the film treats him with an oddly clinical detachment. Rather than putting Mitch in the thick of things ""Contagion"" pretty much sends him into immediate quarantine. Along with his teenage daughter (Anna Jacoby-Heron) Mitch spends most of the movie sensibly holed up inside his house as the world around him descends into a chaos of looting and Internet-fueled panic. One of the films cleverest touches involves a secondary sense of the word viral. Using the Web as his pulpit an unscrupulous blogger (Law) foments government conspiracy theories from the sidelines touting an untested homeopathic ""cure"" for the disease called forsythia. Laws character a shadowy Julian Assange-like demagogue called Alan Krumwiede - whose face appears throughout the film plastered on posters labelled ""Prophet"" - is funny and seductive. Hes almost creepier than MEV-1. And speaking of creepy several scenes that seem calculated to frighten - shots of panicky shoppers stocking up on bottled water and hand sanitizer and of people coughing without covering their mouths - were met with not with gasps but with titters of nervous laughter. Though ""Contagions"" trailer would have you believe its a nail-biter its pleasures are mostly cerebral not visceral. Its real heroes are not the Homeland Security officers (led by a dour Brian Cranston) who initially attribute the plague to bioterrorism or even Damon who as the biggest name in the movie is mysteriously underutilized. Instead theyre the buttoned-down bureaucrats from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (run by Fishburne) and the medical professionals working behind the scenes to identify treat and contain the disease (Winslet Cotillard and others). The breakthroughs in the action if it can even be called that come not in the field but in the lab first with the replication of the virus by a protocol-busting researcher (Gould) and then with the discovery of a possible vaccine administered in her own thigh in an act of selfless bravery by a CDC researcher (Jennifer Ehle). If this is an action-thriller its one that makes med school look sexier than the Marines.Contains brief obscenity some violence and a mildly grisly autopsy scene.

Contagion (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Contagion (PG-13) Steven Soderberghs all-star thriller about the outbreak of a deadly virus is the scariest movie of the year. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle The Miami Herald9/8/2011 Editor rating 3 The most terrifying movie of the year is not about zombies or aliens or vampires or serial killers. Its about truly scary things ATMs. Handrails. Doorknobs. Cash. Handshakes. Water fountains. Elevator buttons. Restaurants. Casinos. Movie theaters. Try to watch Steven Soderberghs unnerving Contagion without thinking about whose hands last touched the armrests youre using. You will fail. Then pay attention to how many times you carelessly touch your face while watching the movie (or even reading this sentence). Are you getting the picture? Were one bad happenstance away from a virulent killer virus that could wipe out large segments of the world population Soderbergh tells us and there isnt a whole lot we can do about it (though washing your hands often is a good start). The film written by Scott Z. Burns and featuring an impressive all-star cast starts with a cough and leads to global desperation as a mysterious swift-acting virus comes to the attention of world health authorities. YouTube provides early evidence of whats afoot by way of a cellphone video of a man collapsing and dying in front of shocked onlookers on a subway train. In the new world order of social media there isnt much hope of keeping a pandemic under wraps. Soderbergh rarely a waster of words or time moves the plot along almost as quickly as the virus spreads. Contagion may be the most expensive public-service ad ever filmed but its also a surprisingly light-on-its-feet action thriller. Much like he did with Traffic Soderbergh juggles his unwieldy cast with ease and sets up Contagion as something of a detective story a who-spread-it instead of a whodunnit. His characters pause occasionally to deliver sobering facts about say the death toll of the 1918-19 Spanish influenza outbreak which killed 50 million worldwide by some estimates and more by others or the deadly efficiency with which viruses can multiply (providing some of the most frightening mathematical equations youve ever had to solve). Several storylines and characters emerge An apparently immune father in Minneapolis (Matt Damon) tries to protect his teenage daughter after his wife (Gwyneth Paltrow) drops dead two days after returning from an overseas business trip. A World Health Organization doctor (Marion Cotillard) tries to track Patient Zero through security videos at a casino in Hong Kong while her desperate colleagues there know their home villages are being ravaged. A U.S. Centers for Disease Control official (Laurence Fishburne) sends a doctor (Kate Winslet) out among the sick while he tries to find ways to stem the rising panic and potential chaos. An activist blogger (Jude Law) challenges official assertions about how fast a vaccine can be made available claiming the government is in bed with pharmaceutical companies that are plotting to make billions instead of save lives. The fact that Soderbergh makes you care about so many characters who dont get a lot of screen time is a testament to his skill and that of his cast. There isnt much in Contagion that doesnt seem plausible even if youre not the paranoid sort. If youre the sort of person who doesnt leave the house without a bottle of Purell the movie may make you rethink overseas travel -- or even using a public restroom. Though Soderbergh doesnt end his film on an utterly bleak note he drives home the point that pandemics are the cost of doing business on this crowded changing planet.

At least thats what almost happens in ""Contagion"" director Steven Soderberghs intellectually stimulating new drama about the terrifyingly rapid spread of a lethal virus. Before theres even a picture on the screen moviegoers hear a slight cough -- really more of a throat clearing -- on the soundtrack. Then Gwyneth Paltrow shows up -- shes the one who coughed and yikes she does it again -- as a woman grabbing a bite at a Chicago airport on her way home to Minneapolis from a business trip to Hong Kong. Also read Warrior Packs a Punch But Doesnt Quite Go the Distance She is the first to become sick -- soon millions will die -- during the course of ""Contagions"" dark what-if scenario. Playing almost like a hybrid documentary thriller the movie looks at how both individuals and medical and political institutions around the world might handle such an epidemic. Within days of the onset of Paltrows illness similar cases crop up in Hong Kong Tokyo and London. It doesnt take long for the medical establishment to understand that it is dealing with a new contact-borne disease whose deadly germs are spread between persons via coughs handshakes door handles and other contact. As more and more people sicken and die around the world panic takes hold. Ordinary citizens begin wearing protective surgical masks and anxious mobs storm grocery and drugstores hoping to grab increasingly scarce basic supplies and anything touted as a possible cure or preventive measure. Even as Paltrows bewildered husband played by Matt Damon struggles to understand whats going on and cope the global medical bureaucracy swings into action. Laurence Fishburne playing a high-ranking official at the Center for Disease Control dispatches Kate Winslet portraying a physician to Minneapolis to attempt to contain the outbreak. Marion Cotillard cast as a doctor with the World Health Organization tries to zero in on where the epidemic began. Elliot Gould and Jennifer Ehle as medical researchers aim to indentify the virus and develop a vaccine. And Jude Law as a maverick blogger reports on the spread of the outbreak and hypes a cure he claims the government is failing to disclose. Soderbergh (""The Informant) deploys his large ensemble cast with pinpoint precision effectively establishing whos who and what theyre doing even as the story (and the virus) rush forward. But the movie has so many characters and is trying to tell such a large story that none of the individual characters have enough screen time to create much of an impact. The result ""Contagion"" is a movie that engages a viewers brain more than ones heart. This is an ambitious film. Soderbergh and screenwriter Scott Z. Burns (""The Informant"") are working on a vast canvas. While there are plenty of current Hollywood films with extensive casts and locations ""Contagion"" is one of the rare ones that is actually about something real rather than just superheroes or machine gun-equipped robots battling it out. With its strong grounding in real science and recent medical scares (such as the avian flu and the continuing scourge of AIDS) the movie effectively and dramatically raises (and sometimes answers) provocative and pertinent questions. What unilateral protective measures should governments take? How fast might the rules of society break down? If a vaccine was developed how quickly could it be put into production and who decides who gets it first? By its end the movie leaves a viewer wrung out and feeling slightly queasy though thankfully thats only a passing feeling one cinematically rather than germ-induced. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Photo (c)Warner Bros/courtesy Everett Co Marion Cotillard plays a medical worker Arriving two days before the 10th anniversary of 9/11 Steven Soderberghs ""Contagion"" is a serious all-star thriller about the rapid worldwide spread of a killer virus thats easily the scariest of the disaster films that have followed the attack. Youll think twice about shaking hands sharing food touching doorknobs or not laying in a six-month supply of Purell after seeing people dropping left and right as panic spreads around the globe -- while scientists race to contain an airborne pandemic that quickly eclipses the 50 million killed by the 1918 influenza pandemic. The screenplay by Scott Z. Burns -- who collaborated with Soderbergh on the vastly different ""The Informant"" -- takes great pains to present its situations realistically and includes a lot of intelligent speculation about what sort of political economic and ethical questions would be raised by such a disaster. PHOTOS CONTAGION PREMIERE IN NY At the same time Soderbergh doesnt lecture the audience packing a lot of thrills chills and useful health information -- and references to SARS swine flu Hurricane Katrina and 9/11 -- into a running time well under two hours. It was an inspired touch to cast Gwyneth Paltrow -- an actress many of us love to hate -- as the pandemics Patient Zero. She unknowingly picks up the bug on a business trip to Hong Kong and is first seen spreading it through the first-class lounge at a Chicago airport after a layover quickie with her lover. Within the films first 10 minutes Paltrow expires after her arrival home in Minnesota -- Im not giving away anything thats not in the trailer -- and is quickly followed into the afterlife by the son she embraces. Her widower played by a low-key Matt Damon in the ensembles largest role has a natural immunity but hes quickly hustled into quarantine after the victims start piling up. The films other focus is the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta where big-shot Laurence Fishburne dispatches Kate Winslet to Minnesota to try to control the growing pandemic. Its erupted over the Thanksgiving weekend -- ""the biggest shopping weekend of the year"" exclaims a skeptical gubernatorial aide when Winslet suggests closing shopping malls as a precaution. Meanwhile in Hong Kong a World Health Organization representative (Marion Cotillard) has tracked the source of Paltrows infection to a casino. But then shes kidnapped and held hostage by people who want to insure theyre at the front of the long line when and if a cure is found. After the virus source is discovered by a San Francisco researcher (Elliott Gould) a CDC scientist (Jennifer Ehle outstanding in her first major screen role) races to develop a vaccine -- and a shortcut to avoid lengthy clinical trials. Even if she can how will limited quantities be distributed? What are the priorities? How much should the public know and when should it know it? As panic spread and riots begin to break out a sleazy blogger (Jude Law perfectly cast) cashes in by plugging a homeopathic cure he has a financial interest in. ""Contagion"" does a good job of showing how thanks to the Internet misinformation can spread as rapidly as any disease -- and under the right circumstances can be just as lethal. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next NBA makeover Read Next NBA makeover Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 44665 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 21991 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 16059 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

PicturesEpidemic of panic Jude Law is an activist blogger who adds to the paranoia when he insists the public isnt getting the whole story.Sponsored LinksThe speed with which a lethal virus spreads across the world is alarming as are the glimpses of how germs jump from host to host. Director Steven Soderbergh effectively conveys the capriciousness of disease as it seeps into all corners of the global village. Contagion is more unsettling than 1995s Outbreak or the disaster movies of the 70s. Symptoms of this lethal illness are deceptively mundane. No bleeding eyeballs here just hacking coughs clammy faces and mild fevers. But all too quickly come the seizures and brain hemorrhages.The first half of the film builds a haunting sense of dread. But once the medical community steps in to find a cure and players start to multiply as fast as infectious germs the tension in this peripatetic docudrama dials down. The film offers a parade of scientists and bureaucrats each offering a few lines of predictable dialogue while the pathogen mutates on and on.Soderbergh is usually masterful with ensemble casts but the character arcs here fall flat and only a few performances manage to inspire.Matt Damon plays Mitch the films resolute Everyman who is dealt a shattering blow. His wife Beth is portrayed by Gwyneth Paltrow who sheds any hint of glamour as Patient Zero. Having contracted the killer virus on a business trip to Hong Kong Beth unknowingly brings it home to Minneapolis.About the movieContagion  1/2 out of fourStars Matt Damon Gwyneth Paltrow Laurence Fishburne Kate Winslet Marion Cotillard Bryan Cranston Jennifer EhleDirector Steven Soderbergh Distributor Warner Bros. Rating PG-13 for disturbing content and some language Running time 1 hour 45 minutes Opens Friday nationwideJennifer Ehle is credible as a scientist researching vaccines and Laurence Fishburne as the top CDC official offers some of the films better one-liners.The lawless panic that could overtake a society amid such a nightmarish scenario seems highly plausible. Looting robbery and rioting spread which raises the question of which is worse rampant fear or the disease itself?While potent and well-paced Contagion doesnt come together as the fearsome bio-thriller it starts out to be. But it may make audiences twitchy about the guy coughing in the next row. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

From Contagion - My Job Interview Got Pushed My Job Interview Got Pushed Credit Warner Bros. From Contagion - Its Figuring Us Out Its Figuring Us Out Credit Warner Bros Being a star is no guarantee of survival in Contagion a sober methodical bug hunt in which even household names bite the dust. Fortunately there are plenty to go around as Elliott Gould and Gwyneth Paltrow are as likely to wind up in body bags as Matt Damon and Kate Winslet. Seeing this much imperiled talent crammed into a single movie recalls the 1970s heyday of disaster dramas (and value-for-money moviegoing) when over-emoting A-listers scrambled to survive flaming buildings sinking ocean liners and terra less-than-firma. This time the threat however is invisible a deadly virus replicating more aggressively than a reality-show mom on fertility meds. As though using an Arthur Hailey novel as a template director Steven Soderbergh and screenwriter Scott Z. Burns weave multiple characters into a narrative thats complex without being confusing and intelligent without being baffling. A sushi chef in Hong Kong shakes Gwynnies hand while shes on a business trip; she hugs a colleague who sneezes in an elevator; one of its passengers coughs on a crowded bus. All become sick and 1 in 4 dies -- but not before sharing germs with everyone in their vicinity. Global in scale but very particular in focus Contagion unfolds as an engrossing believable search for patient zero and an effective vaccine. (""Its not a good time to be a rhesus monkey"" remarks one character dryly.) More grounded in science than suspense its rhythms evoke the steady beat of the crime procedural as the Centers for Disease Control (represented by Laurence Fishburne Kate Winslet and a terrific Jennifer Ehle) and the World Health Organization (fronted by Marion Cotillard) work to save lives and stem panic. Even so the films most chilling images are not of the frothing twitching infected but of a civilization slowly disintegrating. Scenes of plush boardrooms and serene laboratories alternate with plundered pharmacies cordoned cities and deadly home invasions. But this is no special-effects extravaganza Choosing the simmer over the boil at almost every turn Soderbergh and Burns have crafted an even-tempered drama that flares only occasionally into brief violence. Tension is muted and cumulative; like the virus it hunts Contagion creeps under the skin. i Bug Chasers Laurence Fishburne and Jennifer Ehle are among the researchers pursuing a treatment for what quickly becomes a global pandemic. Claudette Barius/Warner Bros. hide caption toggle caption Claudette Barius/Warner Bros. Bug Chasers Laurence Fishburne and Jennifer Ehle are among the researchers pursuing a treatment for what quickly becomes a global pandemic. Claudette Barius/Warner Bros. Anchoring the chaos a worn-looking Matt Damon is quietly effective as a bereaved Everyman anxiously protecting his teenage daughter. The character is a crucial emotional touchstone and Soderbergh checks in with him regularly to remind us of the microeffects of macro policies. Nor does he neglect the clash of multiple agendas suggesting that Hong Kongs embarrassment over the SARS epidemic could affect its leaders actions in another crisis and illustrating the way high-profile officials can become valuable hostages to those who have always felt overlooked and undervalued. Cool-headed and cooler-toned (Soderbergh shot the film as usual under the pseudonym Peter Andrews) Contagion wigs out only when it comes to the character of Krumwiede a hungry English blogger embodied by an appropriately skeevy Jude Law. Understanding that information is also viral the film dumps all its paranoia and conspiracy fears into Krumwiedes self-aggrandizing lap using his blog posts and the panic they inspire to warn that sometimes the most dangerous minds have the widest reach. The most terrifying aspect of Contagion ultimately is the plausibility of its premise. Meticulous and low-key the film reminds us that disaster lies in the most mundane interactions. Enjoy; but dont forget to wash your hands afterward.

Burns; Release Date Wide 09/09/2011; Runtime (in minutes) 105; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted September 20 2011 -- 1200 AM EDT Ive seen a lot of frightening stuff at the movies. But nothing matches the terror of watching a hand dip into a bowl of nuts at an airport bar and thus spreading death in Contagion. Heres a scare-the-crap-out-of-you medical thriller about a viral pandemic that will have the immediate post-screening effect of causing a hand-washing stampede; the secondary effect of causing a dip in airline travel; and the longer-term effect of causing you to think Forget it were all screwed. With a new virus discovered every week (capable of spreading exponentially from one to one billion in 30 steps) we pretty much are. Directed with a fiendishly cool attention to realistic detail by Steven Soderbergh Contagion begins with a cough from a working mommy named Beth (Gwyneth Paltrow). Beth feels kind of punk flying back from a business meeting in Hong Kong to her husband (Matt Damon) and young son in Minneapolis. At home Beth quickly feels worse; then she disintegrates with fever seizures and brain hemorrhages; then she dies. This is no idle spoiler Im spilling Beth is the human face of the start of what will unfold as a global pandemic. (Its not the last well see of Paltrow either who does an excellent seizure only to reappear as a vital presence in flashbacks.) Contagion spreads its compelling insidious plot from Beths death working backward and forward similar to the way epidemiologists at the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization do as they seek the source of each new viral mutation as well as its the antidote. If the upside of commonplace international travel is the ability to make the world feel small the downside is that everyone everywhere is just a cough a hand touch or an eye rub away from worldwide infection. The script by frequent Soderbergh collaborator Scott Z. Burns (The Informant) is somewhat swollen with Babel-like symptoms of too many button-pushing Subplots of Human Interest. But the big picture is terrifically well built involving a CDC deputy director (Laurence Fishburne) responsible for coordinating response as well as the dissemination of information to a panic-prone public; the CDC Epidemic Intelligence Service officer (Kate Winslet) he sends into one of the first hot spots to work next to first responders; a medical researcher (Jennifer Ehle) racing to produce a vaccine; a WHO representative (Marion Cotillard) tracking global dissemination; and an independent activist blogger by the extravagant name of Alan Krumwiede (Jude Law) whose aggressive independent investigation and reporting on his guerrilla-truth website have their own viral effects. The movies attitude toward the bloke is telegraphed by Laws prosthetic snaggletooth and duck-like walk. The cast be it known is uniformly crackerjack I single out Ehle Law and the absolutely indispensable Damon only because Ive just disinfected my computer keyboard and can keep typing. Contagion opens not with a bang but a shiver as scenes of very ordinary everyday life -- little kids in a classroom singles at a bar waiters and busboys doing the handling and wiping for which they were hired -- mask the catastrophe at hand. The movie ends not with a bang but more of a whew a few wan attempts at sentimental satisfaction and an infectious thump of dread. I couldnt look away and neither did I touch my face with my hands.

By the time this globe-hopping movie-star-crammed disaster saga - directed with petrifying efficiency by Steven Soderbergh - comes full circle youll never want to touch a subway pole or elevator button or ATM again. More about Contagion >> In fact you may not want to touch another human being - even the ones you live with. ""Somewhere in the world the wrong pig met up with the wrong bat"" quips one of the epidemiologists busy trying to stop a pandemic that with alarming speed is laying low the citizens of Hong Kong and Minneapolis London and San Francisco of anywhere and everywhere. Even Gwyneth Paltrow isnt immune. In the same crisp cracking way Soderbergh moved from one continent to another and one character to the next in his 2000 drug-smuggling Oscar-winner Traffic the director swoops in on the sick and the panicky the government officials and the crackpots as he tracks the course of a deadly disease. Paltrow is a businesswoman just returned from meetings in Kowloon. Back at home in suburban Minneapolis and back with her husband Mitch (Matt Damon) she suddenly feels feverish weak shaky. One minute shes trying to pour a cup of coffee the next shes on the floor in the throes of a seizure. At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta Laurence Fishburne is Dr. Ellis Cheever who dispatches one of his top staffers Erin Mears (Kate Winslet) to Minnesota where Paltrows Beth Emhoff is just the tip of the proverbial iceberg. In the Bay Area an aggressively loony blogger who goes around boasting of his millions of ""unique visitors"" is stirring up trouble by suggesting this raging virus is the result of a Big Pharm conspiracy. Jude Law plays this mad hatter of the blogosphere (his site is called Truth Serum Now) with nutty aplomb. However his scariest pronouncement at least to these ears has nothing to do with mobs of violently unwell and dying people. Its when hes at the San Francisco Chronicle pitching an editor on his story and she turns him down. ""Print media is dying"" he snaps exiting in a huff. ""Its dying. Ill save you a seat on the bus."" (Elliot Gould as a scientist trying to isolate the strain gets revenge though informing Laws Alan Krumwiede on their walk-and-talk that ""blogging is not writing."") Paltrow Damon Law Fishburne Winslet Gould . . . who else is facing down Contagions contagion? Theres Marion Cotillard as a dedicated doc with the World Health Organization. Theres John Hawkes playing a janitor at the CDC. Demetri Martin and Jennifer Ehle are a team of scientists testing monkeys to try to find a viable vaccine. And all around the planet as Soderbergh counts off the days - the film starts with Day 2 and somewhere around Day 131 there are more than 20 million dead - the social order is breaking down. There are riots and food shortages and runs on the bank. (Hey who needs a deadly virus? We have that now.) And there are cases of Purell for those lucky enough to still be alive.

(So thats what he got up to after loosing the reins on Moneyball.) Gwyneth Paltrow goes first after sweating and hacking sputum on a flight from Hong Kong to her home in Chicago. At first I thought she was being punished for cheating on her husband (Matt Damon) like a virus version of Hitchcocks The Birds. Not so. Soderbergh and Informant screenwriter Scott Z. Burns are after docudrama gravity not moral lessons or cheap horror scares. Though there are sights to make audiences puke. Watch out for Paltrows skull-peeling autopsy. And Kate Winslet out-coughs Camille as a virus detective who gets infected. Laurence Fishburne and Bryan Cranston are good guys at the Centers for Disease Control and Jennifer Ehle best in show fights the good fight for a cure. The film is most riveting in its early scenes when Soderberghs digital cameras locate germs everywhere - dont touch those peanuts But after a blogger played by Jude Law starts spreading panic all this germ procedural offers is the sight of people behaving badly willing to do their worst to get first dibs on a vaccine.

"Contagion review On the trail of a deadly killer |       NJ.com comments Contagion review On the trail of a deadly killer Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on September 08 2011 at 334 PM updated September 08 2011 at 355 PM View/Post Comments Claudette BariusMatt Damon plays a concerned father in ""Contagion"" which is about the spread of a deadly virus throughout the world. The standard line about director Steven Soderbergh is that he has a simple rule when it comes to balancing art and commerce I do one film for me I do one film for ""them."" So movies such as ""The Girlfriend Experience"" ""Che"" and ""Bubble"" were definitely for him while others such as his planned ""The Man From U.N.C.L.E."" picture are for them. But I think his movies work best when they find a way to combine both wedding commercial genre to inventive style. Think ""Out of Sight"" with its colorful cast of criminals and tricky narrative. Or ""Traffic"" a multilayered drama that used color as a way of keeping its stories separate. Or now ""Contagion."" Soderbergh himself has modestly likened ""Contagion"" to a 70s-style star-driven disaster film. But its smarter than that and a lot closer to medical thrillers like ""The Andromeda Strain."" In ""Contagion"" the villain is a virus rapidly spreading across the world and through Soderberghs cast. People froth at the mouth and drop dead. Survivors retreat into the armed fortresses of their homes. Meanwhile the World Health Organization tries to find the pandemics origin and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tries to find a cure while another virus -- made up of fear and paranoia and bad information -- spreads across the internet. Soderbergh has always been a visual artist -- he has already announced his intention to retire from filmmaking and just paint -- and the best moments of ""Contagion"" are the ones where he manages to show us this invisible invaders path. A woman coughs at a bar and then puts her hand in a bowl of peanuts. Someone wipes his face and then touches a doorknob. Friends and lovers kiss and contaminate. And all of this information is conveyed wordlessly in a quick procession of images. But unlike many stylists Soderbergh takes care with his cast too. (This is the director after all who made Jennifer Lopez look like a movie star in ""Out of Sight"" and Julia Roberts like an actress in ""Erin Brockovich."") And he has some good people here. Not all of them unfortunately have quite enough to do (although Matt Damon is particularly good as a concerned dad). While its good to see a film in which problems are solved with brains not guns the dogged calm of these medical professionals weighs down the performances with only selfless doctor Kate Winslet really standing out. Supporting actress Jennifer Ehle however who plays one of the whip-smart CDC researchers is terrific. With her patterned stockings and small secret smile shes a sexy bit of life in the lab; you see the glint in her eye as she talks about rare viral mutations and you see how weirdly thrilling she finds all this in spite of herself. Soderbergh is smart enough himself to know that fine art is a difficult thing to pursue; hes joked that if the painting doesnt work out you may find him directing yet another ""Oceans 11"" caper. I sure hope not. But Id love to see another film like ""Contagion"" from him. Where art and commerce meet -- thats where hes at his best. Ratings note The film contains violence and strong language. Contagion (PG-13) Warner Bros. (105 min.) Directed by Steven Soderbergh. With Matt Damon Kate Winslet Marion Cotillard Laurence Fishburne Jude Law Gwyneth Paltrow. Now playing in New Jersey.

"Contagion movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-EntertainmentMovie review ContagionA lethal virus spreads across the globe and inspires panic and fear in Steven Soderberghs thriller.September 09 2011|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic It starts with a cough. It ends with death on an unimaginable scale. ""Contagion"" the new thriller by Steven Soderbergh tells a story for our time a story of raging menace and out of control fear. It offers us thirtysomething days in the life of a global pandemic a lethal virus that travels like the wind and kills without a trace of mercy. This may not fit any conventional definition of entertainment but it certainly keeps your eyes on the screen. Soderbergh who divides his career between unwatchable vanity projects and crackling mainstream fare has never been the warmest of filmmakers and that coldness and distance serve him well here. As the merciless MEV-1 virus ravages the planet the uncomfortable prospect that every last person on Earth may die before the final credits roll feels all too possible. Credit for this sense of disturbing unease has to be shared with screenwriter Scott Z. Burns who co-wrote ""The Bourne Ultimatum."" Hes constructed a story in which human arrogance self-interest and stupidity are as dangerous as this disease that inevitably brings out the worst as well as the best in human behavior. One of the things that makes Soderbergh (also his own cinematographer under the Peter Andrews alias) such an effective filmmaker is that he knows how to move stories along at an epidemic clip. Working with longtime editing collaborator Stephen Mirrione (who won an Oscar for the similarly episodic ""Traffic"") Soderberghs made a film you may not want to watch but cant stop yourself from staring at. As with ""Traffic"" the director expertly choreographs an impressive cast that includes major players like Matt Damon Laurence Fishburne Jude Law Gwyneth Paltrow Kate Winslet and Marion Cotillard. Some of their characters will live some will die and neither the virus nor the filmmakers care. The face behind that opening unseen cough belongs to Paltrow who plays traveling businesswoman Beth Emhoff. Introduced in an airport on her way home from a trip to China she thinks what ails her is some minor bug. Except its not. The seriousness of Beths illness brings some major changes to the lives of her husband Mitch (Damon the best Everyman in the business) and her step-daughter Jory (an effective feature debut by Anna Jacoby-Heron). Theyre just regular folks from Minneapolis for heavens sake theyre not prepared for whats about to hit them. Determined to leave no sick person behind ""Contagion"" swiftly takes us around the world exposing us to a panoply of desperately ill individuals in Hong Kong Tokyo London and elsewhere people who disturbingly disintegrate and die right before our eyes. After seeing how easily the virus spreads even touching your car door on the way home will take an effort of will. A plague this lethal inevitably involves the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and its unflappable deputy director Dr. Ellis Cheever (Fishburne). He sends one of his best young investigators Dr. Erin Mears (Winslet) to Minneapolis to see whats going on. Similarly Genevas World Health Organization sends top epidemiologist Dr. Leonora Orantes (Cotillard) to China to figure out where it all began. The increasing severity of the disease also attracts the attention of Alan Krumwiede (an intentionally irritating Law) an Internet conspiracy theorist based in (where else but) San Francisco. Krumwiede (even his name is annoying) may know some things others dont but its not necessarily information you can take to the bank. The challenge the folks at the CDC face is identifying the virus growing it in the lab and then coming up with a vaccine. Enlisted in this cause are a wide range of individuals including virus guru Dr. Ian Sussman (Elliott Gould a veteran Soderbergh collaborator) and the CDCs own Dr. Ally Hextall. Two-time Tony-winning actress Jennifer Ehle comes close to stealing the picture with this quietly yet quirkily empathetic performance. Like the humans who combat the disease ""Contagion"" is hardly perfect. Its sporadic attempts at sympathetic vignettes are largely beyond it and some of its many plot strands play out less convincingly than others. But if youre looking for a film that makes the spread of a global pandemic seem more than plausible this is where you want to be. kenneth.turanlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESWord of Mouth Contagion could really catch onSeptember 8 2011Fall Sneaks listSeptember 4 2011The Directors Steven Soderbergh ContagionSeptember 4 2011MORE STORIES ABOUTEntertainmentScott Z.

Shari L. Gross Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Contagion"" will do for hand sanitizer what ""Jaws"" did for shark repellent. From its shrewdly underplayed opening -- a couple of coughs on the soundtrack before the films first image -- Steven Soderberghs plague thriller insidiously eats away at your nerves. A steady accumulation of naturalistic detail makes the advent of a doomsday virus feel not just credible but inevitable. Some thrillers make you grip your seat mates hand in anxiety. ""Contagion"" will have viewers flinching if anyone touches them. That introductory coughing is the overture to a catastrophe. The sore throat belongs to Minneapolis executive Beth Emhoff (Gwyneth Paltrow) returning from a trip to Asia pale and complaining of jet lag. Actually shes about to become the first convulsing casualty of a hell-on-Earth pandemic. She dies in mid-exam at the University of Minnesota Medical Center Fairview (with Chicago locations making very persuasive stand-ins for Minneapolis). Soderberghs less-is-more approach establishes the new disease as an abomination. When two hospital workers open Beths skull for a post-mortem they freeze in dismay. One gulps ""Should I call someone?"" ""Call everyone"" the other responds. The film never reveals the source of their revulsion. It doesnt have to. Beths shellshocked husband Mitch (Matt Damon) wants answers about his wifes sudden death. Health officials worldwide realize that this is The Big One. Laurence Fishburne brings full-bodied authority and integrity to his role as the head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Kate Winslet plays a CDC epidemiologist dispatched to Minnesota. Marion Cotillard portrays a World Health Organization official charting the spread of the virus from its first appearance at a Macau casino and Jennifer Ehle is a virus researcher on the trail of a vaccine. Its telling that this very contemporary medical thriller features three capable women and no men on the dangerous front lines. The death toll rockets with social breakdown spreading as fast as the fatal flu. Jude Law plays a health blogger who becomes a major player as desperate millions buy into his promise of a homeopathic cure. The character of a thwarted online journalist who finds the opportunity of a lifetime amid catastrophe is another novel 21st-century touch. Handout Warner Bros. Jude Law in ""Contagion."" Golden Valley native Scott Z. Burns (""The Informant"") peppers his screenplay with knowing references to Minnesota with asides about ""Mondale Elementary School"" and a scene of Wisconsin National Guardsmen turning back fleeing motorists at the border. (When Minnesotans make a mass migration to Wisconsin you know the End Times have arrived.) Burns subtly links his plague tale to the real malaise of worldwide economic collapse. There are echoes of Barack Obama in Fishburnes beleaguered health czar. The genesis of the disease is the consequence of a corporate decision. The first infection occurs at a feverishly overlit casino where business types are making irresponsible high-stakes wagers. Using major stars to anchor the sprawling cast and chronological subtitles to order the months-long story arc keep the ambitious narrative coherent. Some viewers may feel that the multi-strand narrative with loose ends deliberately unresolved undercuts the actors. I think its the correct strategy. The lead character of ""Contagion"" isnt any member of the cast. Like ""Jaws"" this is a story in which nature itself is the protagonist. Humans only get the walk-on roles. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

(Warner Bros/AP) Joe Neumaier Thursday September 8 2011 221 PM Title Contagion With Matt Damon Laurence Fishburne Kate Winslet. A deadly disease spreads across the globe. Director Steven Soderbergh. (146) PG-13 Language. At area theaters.Theres a lot of viral activity in ""Contagion"" -- as in scary buzz on the Internet word-of-mouth fear itself and the biological kind. Yet the craziness never fully blooms in Steven Soderberghs movie about a killer disease that sweeps the planet and the result is like someone injected ""ER"" with the blood of ""The Poseidon Adventure.""Soderbergh is too smart a filmmaker to simply hit the mass panic button. So ""Contagion"" is methodical in showing scientists at the Center for Disease for Control connecting the dots and calculatinge the risks.The movie starts on the outbreaks Day 2 continuing on (Day 3 Day 23 Day 131) and showing the population of every location we see. But by the halfway mark fans of apocalyptic cinema wind up part of the body count.A Minneapolis woman Beth (Gwyneth Paltrow) is the first victim though she isnt the only one. She has just returned to the U.S. from China and soon anyone who came into contact with her gets the chills a cough blotches and cant swallow.Beths husband (Matt Damon) is oddly immune as is his daughter from an earlier marriage.The script then ping-pongs from the CDC official (Laurence Fishburne) in Atlanta pushing to figure out the disease -- they know its not SARS or H1N1 -- to his employee (Kate Winslet) doing dangerous work in the field. A San Francisco blogger (Jude Law) becomes famous running an alarmist website and a World Health Organization scientist (Marion Cotillard) is sent to China.A whole chart-full of people come in and out. Some like Jennifer Ehles CDC doc are important; others like Elliott Goulds rogue scientist disappear quickly. John Hawkes sad-eyed janitor is seen three times. Someone is kidnapped and then forgetten about. And were never told why Damons Minnesotan has an iron constitution while millions are dying.Soderberghs intellectual approach to how this might be handled is appreciated but even then he and screenwriter Scott Z. Burns skim over basic elements.How do folks confined to their homes get food? How does the food get there given the blocked and crowded roads? What happens to the worlds economies -- would we all live online? Everyones electricity is on so National Grid workers must be immune too.And as for looting -- sure people would want a vaccine but they might also want a Magnavox since theyre stuck in their homes all day.In any disaster thriller the actors just do what they can. Even so Damon is an engaging everyman and Fishburne is an unpredictable chess piece. Law and Winslet are spunky but stuck in caricatures. Cotillard and Sanaa Lathan as Fishburnes wife are left adrift.Theres a sense of dread in ""Contagion"" but it never spreads to us. When Day 1 is finally shown it makes you want to eat better which isnt the same as saying this is a great movie.Magic Moment Big cities resemble ghost towns as people clear the streets.

Pictures Kate Winslet is shown in a scene from the film ""Contagion."" (AP Photo/Warner Bros. Pictures) Beth (Gwyneth Paltrow) comes back from an overseas trip with an ominous souvenir a cough. At first theres nothing to be particularly concerned about. But then she collapses and starts twitching on the floor. Beths husband Mitch (Matt Damon) rushes her to the hospital but soon gets horrible news Shes dead. And the doctors dont know why.The incident is cause for alarm at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and at the World Health Organization. Among those struggling to understand the disease -- and keep a lid on what proves to be a global crisis -- are CDC doctors Erin Mears (Kate Winslet) and Ellis Cheever (Laurence Fishburne) and the WHOs Dr. Leonora Orantes (Marion Cotillard). But with millions getting infected and dying in a matter of days its not long before the Internet-savvy public -- egged on by blogger Alan Krumwiede (Jude Law) -- shifts into panic mode.If the disease doesnt bring down civilization anarchy will. ""Contagion"" has been called a disaster film but its much more realistic and sophisticated than that description would suggest. Working from a screenplay by Scott Z. Burns (""The Informant"") Oscar-winning director Steven Soderbergh sets into play enough plot lines to accommodate at least half a dozen films yet brings it all off with such intelligence style and precision that its breathtaking.With a cast like this its no surprise that the acting is first rate. Winslet brings vivid life to a woman whose selflessness renders her oblivious to danger. Damon is the essence of the ordinary guy caught up in extraordinary circumstances. Law who tends to be at his best when portraying obnoxious creeps just about steals the film. Also impressive is the underrated Jennifer Ehle (""The Kings Speech"") as a CDC doctor whos intent on thwarting the disease.

"Contagion movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Contagion A chill thats catchingSoderbergh mounts coolly efficient epidemic -- 3 starsSeptember 08 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie criticDirector Steven Soderbergh knows how to keep calm in the face of a global pandemic.Hes the anti-Michael Bay the un-Roland Emmerich. No fake-documentary ""realism"" here; Soderbergh values the silence before the storm or a hushed two-person encounter in which one or both parties are concealing something.Written by Scott Z. Burns ""Contagion"" -- likely to provoke a widespread outbreak of midscreening antibacterial hand gel usage -- contains little in the way of on-screen mass panic beyond a drugstore looting sequence.Shot all over the world with major stars yet more like an independent project in its vibe ""Contagion"" imagines the speed breadth and elusive riddle of a virus that causes flulike symptoms followed by seizure and brain hemorrhage and then as we see in a single chillingly offhanded middle-distance shot mass graves.""Contagion"" doesnt hype its own terrifyingly high stakes or body count even as the body count heads into the millions. The result is not quite medicine and not quite cotton candy. But it works. Its made for grown-ups. After this summers onslaught of highly variable superhero fodder ""Contagion"" arrives as a welcome antidote.It begins with a title card announcing Day 2 of the problem. The first thing heard on the soundtrack is a cough. Someone is sick. A Minneapolis businesswoman (Gwyneth Paltrow) reroutes her trip back from Hong Kong through Chicago where we learn in an airport phone call she has rekindled an affair with an old boyfriend before returning home to her husband (Matt Damon) and their two kids. Her death comes very early in ""Contagion.""A Tokyo bus passenger suffers a similar seizure. Captured on cellphone video the incident goes viral though not as fast as the virus itself. The video feeds the outrage and Web traffic of a San Francisco blogger (a twitchy Jude Law) who flogs various conspiracy theories regarding the pandemic.The sudden loss suffered by Damons character provides the emotional access point in a deliberately distanced picture. The script makes dominant clearheaded but human-scaled heroes and heroines out of representatives of the World Health Organization (Marion Cotillard plays an epidemiologist scrambling to re-create the Paltrow characters last hours) and the Centers for Disease Control (Kate Winslets Dr. Mears risks her life with the other first responders while her superior played by Laurence Fishburne considers how much information to release and when).Burns script is very sly about loading up just enough information regarding the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic (50 million dead) and such without sending the average moviegoer brain into tune-out mode. Soderbergh zips around from Geneva to rural China to Minneapolis and Chicago and other cities while the major characters struggle to keep the losses from mounting.""Contagions"" implacable tone has its drawbacks. The movie is almost pathological in its avoidance of messy emotion. In the 105-minute final edit some of the storylines particularly the one anchored by Cotillard fail to fully activate. And while one can see why the story focuses increasingly on the relationship between Damon and his teenage daughter (the honest and unaffected Anna Jacoby-Heron) in the later stages Im not sure Soderbergh and Burns believe in their own sentiment.Yet on some level ""Contagion"" probably needs it lest it dry out to the point of aridity. Throughout Soderbergh reasserts his assurance in the ways and rhythms of the multitrack narrative as well as the aesthetic payoff of the unexpected visual choice. His compositions demand our attention not because theyre kinetic. Quite the opposite Their stillness belies the nature of the pandemic. Its as if the characters are stuck in their own brand of interior dread thinking as fast as they can but often helplessly like deer caught in a limitless number of viral headlights.mjphillipstribune.comContagion -- 3 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for disturbing content and some language)Cast Marion Cotillard (Dr. Orantes); Matt Damon (Mitch); Gwyneth Paltrow (Beth); Laurence Fishburne (Dr. Cheever); Kate Winslet (Dr. Mears); Jude Law (Alan); Jennifer Ehle (Dr. Hextall); Demetri Martin (Dr. Eisenberg); Bryan Cranston (Haggerty); John Hawkes (Roger)Credits Directed by Steven Soderbergh; written by Scott Z.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet It takes just two words superimposed over Gwyneth Paltrows sickly face to establish the mood of Contagion Steven Soderberghs clinically staged chillingly plausible film about a devastating pandemic. Those words ""Day 2."" Whatever has happened to make Paltrow look so ill is already underway and for most of the film characters play a game of catch-up always one step behind a disease that spreads via simple contact takes hold quickly and leaves little but bodies and unanswered questions in its wake. Set in multiple locations across the globe--and with a sprawling cast to match--Contagion glides back and forth along the unseen connections uniting the modern world. Soderbergh places a queasy emphasis on the way the things that make the world we live in smaller make us that much more vulnerable. One day Paltrow sits at a bar eating peanuts and paying with her credit card. The next shes going into seizures as the consequences of those mundane germ-spreading actions fan out behind her. In a cast that includes everyone from Marion Cotillard to Jude Law to Bryan Cranston Kate Winslet and Laurence Fishburne play a few of those dedicated to figuring out how to stop a disease that has math and momentum on its side to say nothing of misinformation and emotion. The films title has multiple meanings referring both to the way the virus spreads and the way talk about the virus spreads along with a mounting sense of panic that also gets passed from person to person. Soderbergh brings a cold-blooded approach to Contagion and the chill generally serves the material well. The films strongest moments belong to Matt Damon who as Paltrows husband is left to take care of their daughter (first-time actress Anna Jacoby-Heron in a terrific debut) amid a disease-ridden terror-stricken Minnesota suburb. In one memorable scene a trip to the grocery store provides an accidental tour of an unraveling civilization. Not all of the subplots prove so compelling however. Some take melodramatic turns at odds with the overall tone. The films lurching momentum disrupts others. But Soderbergh creates an unnerving mosaic from the smaller pieces a vision of a world thats simultaneously tightly knit delicately balanced and prone to breakdown whether due to disease bad ideas or unenlightened self-interest. And sometimes those breakdowns dont become apparent until day two or even further down the line.

""Contagion"" is in my opinion an excellent movie and Steven Soderberghs to date. I just have a problem with how fast the disease spread and how quickly it killed its victims. That is my only criticism of the movie. The scene where Elliot Gould Slam dunks Jude Law telling him blogging is ""graffiti with punctuation"" is excellent. Tedsaid on Saturday January 21 2012 25753 PMRichard nailed this one. Great film-Great score. Didnt lose its way like Outbreak. Amazing film making. Michael S.said on Friday September 16 2011 12518 AMDisturbing and really gets under your skin but written acted and directed to perfection. Easily one of the best films of the year and one of Soderberghs best. Carl the Criticsaid on Tuesday September 13 2011 41927 PMI am afraid I do not agree with you completely. I do agree that it has an Oscar worthy screenplay and direction (as well as acting by Lawrence Fishburne and Jude Law) the story itself was very padded and boring Matt Damons acting lacked energy/realism there was questionable editing (The Scene where Jude Law is talking to Lawrence Fishburne and the camera cuts back and forth revealing both sides of his face for no reason)Marion Cotillard kept changing her accent in the movie giving a mix of French Chinese and even an American accent and by the end of the film I am left with more questions then answers. Im not saying that it was a horrible movie Im just saying that I personally found it boring and hard to get into. Glad you liked the movie though I would have given it a B- myself but hey great review as always Mr. Roeper Dan Skip Allensaid on Tuesday September 13 2011 120332 AMThis is the Review of Contagion From the Fourth Row Ryan Oliversaid on Thursday September 08 2011 40802 PMI enjoyed ""Contagion"" thoroughly but I dont feel it was an A+ worthy movie. Granted to each his own no disrespect to your opinion at all I just found it to be a really solid genre picture with a lot of talented actors but with so many characters they dont all stick and some (most notably Cotillard and Paltrow) get short-changed. I like that it felt ""real"" and not over dramatized which is a step up from most outbreak films but I felt it lacked some of the ""juice"" that some of Soderberghs other films had (Traffic being the prime example). Anyway still better than nearly every film this summer Three-out-of-four stars for me (or B to B+). http//moviemadness-oliverryan.blogspot.com/2011/09/contagion-review.html Ian Montgomerysaid on Thursday September 08 2011 34541 PMI can see now why you hyped it up early. The review and the A+ grade is intriguing. Im still left wondering something though. In your view what exactly makes this movie stand out among others with similar premises and their own notable performances such as Outbreak or Blindness? Is it even fair to compare them at all? James Lewissaid on Thursday September 08 2011 20930 PMQuite a disappointment. Structurally the storyline disintegrated midway through. Lisa Suzanne Harpersaid on Thursday September 08 2011 110852 AMDear Rich. Bryan Cranston is a really talented character actor. With his resume of work I still find that one of his best roles was Hal ( the dad) on Malcolm in the Middle. Hes so versatile. But comedy is harder to master. My Question is- Do you think there should be a seperate category for Comedys at the Oscars? felipesaid on Wednesday September 07 2011 94958 PMI think Marion Cotillard gives an interesting and wonderful performance as she always does (la vie en rose a very long engagement nini inception) and she deserves an academy award nominations for supporting actress or with Midnight in Paris because her talent must be taking into consideration to get awards and nominations.

Contagion Good Director Steven Soderbergh. Cast Matt Damon Kate Winslet Jude Law. Rating PG-13 for disturbing content and some language. This weeks new movie releases Spotlight Jude Law Spotlight Gwyneth Paltrow Spotlight Laurence Fishburne Spotlight Matt Damon Spotlight Kate Winslet If you are a rational person who washes your hands regularly it will make you think twice the next time you shake a strangers hand. But if you are already slightly paranoid about the spread of contagious diseases Steven Soderberghs film about a deadly virus that kills millions will leave you quivering in a corner like a tub of goo. Soderbergh knows exactly how to dredge up the dread showing us in several scenes the many things we touch - including our own faces noses and mouths - during the course of a day and the dangers they contain. You can wear a hazmat suit in the lab all the livelong day but how are you protecting yourself against the bartender who wiped his nose with his hand just before pouring your beer? Contagion actors catch germphobia Alas Soderbergh wrangles together a few too many story lines to service his all-star case which dilutes the impact of the paranoia and fear gripping the planet as it becomes more and more clear that things have gotten out of control. No one can get a handle on the virus - an unintentional metaphor for the movie itself. The film begins with a black screen and the sound of a cough perfect. It turns out to be Beth Emhoff (Gwyneth Paltrow) who is in a Chicago airport bar fresh off a tryst with an old boyfriend during a layover on the way home to Minnesota from Hong Kong. Just jet lag she thinks. She arrives home to her husband Mitch (Matt Damon) and young son. Soon the boy also is coughing and it quickly becomes clear that this isnt just a garden-variety flu. Soderbergh zips around the world showing a man collapsing on a bus in Asia and similar episodes in other cities. From there we meet Dr. Ellis Cheever (Laurence Fishburne) at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta who is working with Dr. Ally Hextall (Jennifer Ehle) first to try to figure out what is going on and then how to stop it. Kate Winslet is on hand as a doctor in the field. Marion Cotillard is a doctor from the World Health Organization - her story is the most troublesome going from extraneous to near-ridiculous over the course of the film. Jude Law is enjoyably oily as a blogger who isnt above whipping up a little paranoia if it means getting hits. We care about these people and their situations to varying degrees. Although each has at least some compelling aspect to his or her story each also eventually treads perilously close to cliche. The film is far more effective when through them we see the gradual disintegration of the social order. All are good Damon in particular but there are so many of them we dont see anyone for very long at one stretch. And all are given at least some bad material to work with before the movie is over. For the most part they make the best of it. And even if things get a little sappy in places theres no denying the skill with which Soderbergh manipulates the audience. A dip of the hand into cocktail peanuts here a shared sip there and before you know it the world is driven to its knees. It seems so real so plausible - so terrifying. So if youll excuse me Im going to go wash my hands. Again. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter twitter.com/goodyk.

"Contagion A Viral Video that Often Looks Like a Public Health Announcement | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Culture Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters movie Contagion A Viral Video that Often Looks Like a Public Health Announcement Apocalyptic Thrillers All-Star Cast is Undermined by Incoherent Plotlines By Rex Reed  09/06/11 938pm Damon. It is often predicted that the world will no longer end with the whimper of a long boring war but with the scream of a fatal incurable and fast-moving plague. Addressing that theme in time to scare the living daylights out of everybody Contagion is a star-studded apocalyptic wake-up call to the horrors that await mankind in a test tube. Weve made so much progress in terms of immunology technology scientific research and medical miracles that the planet considers itself immune to everything from small pox to swine flu. But theres still no cure for cancer or AIDS and the canvas of new viruses gets broader every year. So the topicality in Contagion is dark and unquestionable if not creepy and off-putting. Tracking the global spread of an infectious virus that leads to deadly brain hemorrhages with no vaccine writer Scott Burns and maverick director Steven Soderbergh have jump-started the serious fall movie season with an ambitious project that packs a wallop without much guarantee of commercial success. We have enough to worry about already; this movie says why bother since were all doomed anyway. Telling a complex story in a coherent narrative arc has never been one of Mr. Soderberghs strengths and chronicling the day-by-day panic of a killer virus jumps all over the place. Melding elements from diverse sources the film has a documentary quality that wastes the talents of an impressive A-list cast. The bubonic plague epidemic that wiped out half of Europe in the Middle Ages was finally traced to a contaminated well in a town square. To discover the origin of the mutating horror in Contagion you have to wait until  the very last scene. The trajectory actually begins with Day 2. Feeling ill a jet-lagged Gwyneth Paltrow returns to Minneapolis from a business trip in Hong Kong with a strange cough that leads to a migraine headache. Before her husband (Matt Damon) has time to properly welcome her home she goes into a seizure foams at the mouth and dies in the E.R. Their son is the next victim. Like wildfire the sickness spreads to the people she met on her trip who begin to gag sweat and faint from Tokyo to Texas. As the cases multiply so do the guest stars. At the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta health official Laurence Fishburne puts Kate Winslet a leading doctor in the field of communicable diseases in harms way to investigate the outbreaks with mortally toxic results. Meanwhile at World Health Organization headquarters in Geneva researcher Marion Cotillard tries to trace the virus back to its origins in Asia where she is kidnapped. Isolating people exposed to the virus is hard enough but how do you quarantine 98 million people in China? As the plague gains momentum Homeland Security clocks in suspecting bioterrorism and requesting sample vaccines to be injected into the drinking water like fluoride. Schools close. Naturally as in all international crises there are always the profiteers. After Laurence Fishburne is ordered by the Food and Drug Administration to keep research a secret Elliot Gould shows up as a scientist who defies the shutdown of his research lab growing the virus himself and taking credit for a medical breakthrough in print. Meanwhile Jude Law enters the national radar as a sleazy journalist who makes millions by peddling a false cure in the form of a homeopathic treatment called forsythia. Mr. Soderbergh illumines every shadowy corner of this global pandemic with hypothetical examples of what to expect in an actual case of germ warfare. The Secret Service escorts the president out of Washington  through an underground passage. Banks gas stations and public transportation collapse. Nurses go on strike. Hospital generators expire. Pharmacies are looted for bogus serums. Evacuation routes are blocked. Cities are looted and left in trash piles. And while the volume of misinformation builds heres a contemporary anxiety to mull over in the age of Twitter Facebook and the Internet its easier to reduce an entire civilization to hysterics than ever before. None of the fragmented subplots are followed to a satisfying conclusion. Even after Jennifer Ehle as a dedicated and heroic lab researcher ignores government approvals and permissions for human experiments and tests a trial vaccine on herself inoculations are determined by national lottery depending on birth dates. Juggling multiple plotlines proved successful in Mr. Soderbergs Traffic (and even more so in Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritus vastly superior Babel). Here the conceit just seems jagged and annoying without achieving the desired synchronicity. The film often looks like a lengthy public health announcement on the requirements for travel vaccinations. A lot of the medical technology in the dialogue is too technical for the lay mind to grasp.  Who knows from ""viral protein cells""? Do stick around for the epilogue--a clever re-enactment of how the virus started and an explanation of Day 1. The ensemble cast is excellent if underused. And some of it is downright gasp-inducing especially when the characters see Gwyneth Paltrows lovely head open and the scalp pulled down over her eyes on the operating table. I found Contagion both flawed and fascinating but its not an entertainment. rreedobserver.com CONTAGION Running Time 105 minutes Written by Scott Z.

Gwyneth Paltrow plays Beth Emhoff an American employee for an ominously unspecific multinational corporation who returns from a business trip in Hong Kong to her wintry Midwestern home feeling like crap. Twenty-four hours after shes written off her sickness as jet lag in a phone call to her never-seen lover Beth starts convulsing and foaming at the mouth. Shes pronounced dead at the hospital and before her husband Mitch (Matt Damon) can make it home to break the news to their young son the kid follows suit. Soon jet-setters the world over are literally breaking into sweats simultaneously.Beth is fingered as Patient Zero of a virus previously unseen on earth that kills its victims within hours of the onset of symptoms and defies cure containment or scientific understanding; as one researcher puts it ""It kills every cell we put it in."" Hospitals and streets fill with the zombie sick and the social order breaks down almost instantly.In fine Irwin ""Master of Disaster"" Allen style Soderbergh deploys a cast of thousands to help sketch the epidemic as a global class-blind all-encompassing event. Marion Cotillard is the adorable WHO epidemiologist assigned to trace the origins of Beths illness by piecing together her last hours as captured in multiple locations via apparently omnipresent surveillance cams. Laurence Fishburne is the CDC chief who sends deputy Kate Winslet to manage the crisis on the ground while he hunkers down at headquarters and tries to manage the message--a fight thwarted when conspiracy blogger Jude Law posts a video of a Japanese businessman collapsing on a city bus which feeds a global panic that turns survivors like Mitch into hyper-paranoid shut-ins. Bryan Cranston Elliott Gould John Hawkes and Demetri Martin appear in small but crucial roles; Jennifer Ehle has a career-making part as the quietly brilliant researcher whom Soderbergh frames like an ingenue as she reels off jargon at an impossibly fast and mellifluous rate.Speed itself is both a key Contagion theme--the virus that multiplies faster than it can be tracked the technology that allows not only the quick transport of data and people over vast distances but also the constant tracking of that travel--and the films defining aesthetic characteristic. Crafting staccato montages to a coolly insistent drum bass and piano score Soderbergh transitions between his interwoven stories at a rapid-fire pace allowing a couple of seemingly major characters to disappear for long stretches and one to die with a startling lack of sentimentality. That characters burial is presented as a matter-of-fact marker of how bad things have become The only ceremony over the mass grave in the center of a city is a dialogue exchange between bored workers about when the local government ran out of body bags.Contagion is very much a Steven Soderbergh movie--as self-conscious a Hollywood entertainment as his Oceans trilogy and as microscopically attuned to its moment as his 2009 experimental sketch of the economic crisis The Girlfriend Experience. It is also part 1970s star-studded and story-bloated disaster movie and part 1870s satire-as-serialized-soap-opera a pulp-pop confection with an unusually serious-minded social critique at its heart. Think The Towering Inferno as done by Anthony Trollope.Trollopes 1875 doorstop novel The Way We Live Now is an apt point of reference not just because its title could sub for the one Soderbergh and screenwriter Scott Z. Burns chose--their film might take place in a bizarro-world present but its all the more terrifying because of the methodic realism that makes it impossible to distinguish that bizarro world from life on earth circa now. But also Trollopes masterpiece turned a pop-culture craze--serialized novels that used real locomotive crashes as the starting point for ensemble soap operas--on its head. Theres no actual train crash in The Way We Live Now; instead the ""railway disaster"" is perpetrated by a con artist who convinces all of London society high on the 19th centurys ultimate symbol of ""progress""--the steam engine--to invest in a railway that will never be built. Greed and hypocrisy spread well virally in the wake of technological change and before you know it society has collapsed on itself. Soderbergh similarly takes on pop Hollywood forms specifically to make them his own and like The Way We Live Now Contagion exists to trace the chain reaction caused by isolated acts of selfishness unchecked power and a never-sated culture of newer faster better.An act of promiscuity might cause the viruss initial spread across continents but Contagion implies that risky sex has nothing long-term-consequences-wise on the risky high-speed transfer of information. In a world in which grief is expressed via texted emoticon before the body is buried and Web celebrities cause riot-panics as stocks spike with their blog hype meme control becomes the official form of damage control. ""Social distancing"" the name given to the CDCs policy of virus containment via forced isolation of the healthy is not just the literal opposite of ""social networking"" but its potential endgame. At what point in the near future will we all stop leaving the house?As prolific a worker as any in contemporary Hollywood Soderbergh claims to be on the verge of packing in his own career which gives his movie a pretty interesting subtextual twist Work in Contagion is fraught with mortal peril. The first victims are business travelers while Damons stay-at-home dad is spared and even turned into one of the films least ambiguous heroes. If Contagion truly is the first leg of Soderberghs retirement victory lap this harrowing film is a potent reminder of what we stand to lose.

In the germophobes nightmare that is ""Contagion"" Steven Soderbergh puts an Oscar-decorated cast through the wringer of a deadly outbreak. Think of it as ""Stars With SARS"" as Matt Damon Kate Winslet Marion Cotillard Laurence Fishburne and Jude Law race to contain a nasty pandemic that picks off Gwyneth Paltrow in its opening minutes. Still without fully rounded characters its hard to care who lives or dies in what amounts to an extended procedural on how disease prevention orgs might respond to such a scenario. Such disappointments aside a shrewd campaign misrepresenting ""Contagion"" as a white-knuckle chiller should ensure healthy returns. Those hoping for a traditional horror movie -- the sort that inspires nervous dates to reach for their partners arms during the scary bits -- are in for a rude awakening as ""Contagion"" will leave auds thinking twice about where they put their hands. Same goes for that symphony of coughing that invariably accompanies any public screening experience Once an annoyance the unwelcome noise takes on a threatening edge in this context -- a reminder of the scene in 1995s Ebola-inspired film ""Outbreak"" in which someone sneezes in a movie theater and the camera follows the swarm of germs around the darkened room. The film opens on a bowl of peanuts at an airport bar. Enter Paltrows hand. Already highly contagious shes Patient Zero on Day Two of the outbreak. A globe-trotting businesswoman on her way home from Hong Kong her character spreads the disease every time she touches something and Soderberghs camera duly catalogs every possible opportunity for infection from handshakes to credit-card transfers. The helmer sees endless skin-crawling potential in planes trains and public buses alternating between such viral superconductors for the first few minutes as a handful of complete strangers pass the bug. Dubbed MEV-1 the virus will ultimately become the most fleshed-out player in ""Contagions"" sprawling ensemble. As head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Dr. Ellis Cheever (Fishburne) supplies a steady stream of alarmist one-liners. Representing the World Health Organization Dr. Leonora Orantes (Cotillard) flies to China where shes promptly kidnapped and held with the vaccine as her ransom. Elliott Gould Jennifer Ehle and Demetri Martin play lab scientists trying to find a cure while Winslets no-nonsense Dr. Erin Mears operates on the front lines attempting to quarantine the sick. All are vulnerable to infection. Only Matt Damon who plays Paltrows husband Mitch Emhoff is immune. After watching half his family drop dead Mitch becomes that familiar angry-yet-sensible survivor type auds have seen in countless zombie movies. Legend he is not however as the pic reserves its moments of heroism for doctors who defy authority in reckless unrealistic ways (like injecting themselves with a promising vaccine when time is too tight for test trials). As ""Contagion"" develops human panic proves more infectious than the virus itself -- an intriguing idea thats increasingly hard to follow as the leaps in geography and time begin to blur. Though Soderbergh seems to have spared no expense in assembling his cast (a ""Talented Mr. Ripley"" reunion of sorts) or incorporating such far-flung locations as Hong Kong San Francisco and Casablanca the film takes a decidedly anti-glamorous stance. With the exception of Cotillard who looks lovely in her dead-end subplot the actors range from haggard-looking to body bag-ready. As conspiracy-prone blogger Alan Krumwiede Law gets off easy with an unsightly snaggletooth pasted to his veneers -- not bad when you consider poor Paltrow stuck on an autopsy slab as a cranial saw screeches offscreen. Considering its international scope and multiculti ensemble ""Contagion"" should have offered Soderbergh roughly the same potential as ""Traffic."" Instead of serving up several dramatic storylines to seize our interest however Burns script has the bloodless semi-detached quality of strict news reporting. Gone is the color and flavor the writer brought to ""The Informant"" as well as the visual cues that kept the threads straight in ""Traffic."" Armed with Reds new 5K Epic-X ""Tattoo"" cameras Soderbergh squanders all that resolution on downright ugly footage that makes exceptional moments such as street riots and military roadblocks look as unremarkable as scenes set in conference rooms and bio-safety labs. The art of film lighting already mostly lost in cinemas transition from black-and-white to color suffers a deathblow from digital cameras that can make do with available light. What energy ""Contagion"" can muster owes to Cliff Martinezs electronic score; the rest is routine. Soderbergh has often touted his admiration for ""All the Presidents Men"" with its lean just-the-facts plotting and ""Contagion"" is the closest one of his films has come to that format. Still his execution calls to mind Larry McMurtrys critique of the Watergate thriller as ""a picture full of doors"" in which ""The reporters knock on a lot of doors but the doors only lead to their story not the story."" Likewise ""Contagion"" is all procedure with circumstances forcing the characters to do most of their work in isolation or by cell phone. In contrast with the directors other celeb-filled ensemble ""Oceans Eleven"" where chemistry was everything these stars seldom share the screen.

The film dramatizes with brisk ruthlessness the dangers of touching anyone who may be infected -- or anything he or she may have touched By Richard Corliss Sept. 04 2011 Share Read Later EverettGwyneth Paltrow in Contagion Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture As the house lights dimmed in the Venice Film Festivals Darsena Theater before the beginning of Contagion a man sitting just behind us let out a few rasping coughs. Thats not unusual in any movie house just before the feature starts; and journalists for whom the world-premiere screening was held are not a particularly robust bunch. Then Gwyneth Paltrow playing a businesswoman on a flight from Hong Kong to Chicago emitted the same hard bark -- and in a few screen minutes her character was dead from the globe-girdling virus that is the subject of Steven Soderberghs deadly plausible new thriller. When the fellow one row back kept up his hacking I wondered if he was the kind of ""plant"" that horror-movie producer William Castle used to put in theaters to make weird noises and scare the real customers. Except that with Contagion the real fear comes when you leave the theater. Scott Z. Burnss original script dramatizes with brisk ruthlessness the dangers of touching anyone who may be infected -- or anything he or she may have touched. Remember Dennis Millers joke back in the 90s that you had to worry about getting AIDS not just from people you had sex with but from people you wanted to have sex with? Well this is a disease you could get from a family member a coworker a subway sneezer or anyone near anyone who comes near you. One of Contagions creepiest scenes comes early in the film when a distinguished research scientist (Elliott Gould) glances around a diner and instantly spots a dozen places where the virus could contaminate and swiftly kill a customer the rim of a glass the hands of a hash slinger an unsterilized fork a mouth that coughs. (See the top 10 deadliest epidemics.) The Spanish flu epidemic of 1918 killed more than 50 million people perhaps 5% of the worlds population at the time and infected about 500 million. That catastrophe took two years to play out. Today in a few days a few people on transcontinental flights could unknowingly spread a much more severe plague. And if the virus is a new strain as in Contagion months could pass before it was isolated years before a potent antidote could be found produced marketed and distributed. Innocence would be no protection; the only sure antidotes would be home confinement and a healthy paranoia. Docudrama style the movie weaves scenes of epidemiologists to locate the source of the virus and break its code with vignettes of ordinary folks facing mortality or its imminent threat. Knowing from his direction of the similarly sprawling Traffic that an audience needs famous actors as signposts in such a peripatetic narrative Soderbergh cast Laurence Fishburne and Bryan Cranston as officials at the Centers for Disease Control Kate Winslet as a super-sleuth for the Epidemic Intelligence Service and Marion Cotillard as a doctor from the World Health Organization who tracks the virus back to Hong Kong. Matt Damon playing Paltrows husband is the frightened but resolute face of American citizenry; and Jude Law is a rogue blogger who is the first journalist to stumble onto the story and promptly puts the panic in pandemic. (See how to use the Internet to track disease outbreaks in real time.) This is Soderberghs 22nd feature in 22 years; his first was sex lies and videotape followed by crowdpleasers like Erin Brockovich and the Oceans Eleven (Twelve Thirteen) capers and several defiantly indie efforts (Solaris Bubble Che The Girlfriend Experience). Acting as his own cinematographer under the name Peter Andrews and producing many other films (Pleasantville Far from Heaven Syriana) Soderbergh is a whirling creative force with an elusive directorial personality. But the man does have a gift for organization both in putting projects and actors together and in bringing clarity to teeming narratives -- skills put to excellent use here. And in Burns who also wrote Soderberghs drily off-kilter The Informant with Damon as a corporate whistle-blower with a secret agenda he has found a crafty collaborator who knows his craft. For a good hour a very good first hour the film efficiently accumulates small terrifying incidents and images Paltrows haggard face on the flight home; the flecks of froth on a mans mouth; the refusal of a mortician to host funeral services for the victims; and in this fastidious melodramas one uggy moment the peeling back of a corpses scalp to allow an autopsy. Later as the news spreads with the virus and terror propels the population into rabid belligerence the movie sedates its pulse softens its focus and threatens to become a straightfaced Zombieland. Theres also an unnecessary climactic kidnapping. But Burns and Soderbergh manage to tell their epidemiological epic in a hurtling compact 105 minutes. Perhaps for purposes of concision or because they wanted to skirt politics the filmmakers omitted any pharma executives or federal or local politicians from their character list. That leaves a curious hole but Contagion is a movie not a miniseries. If the film has a villain its Laws blogger named Krumwiede (as in crumb-weed which sounds like an eight-year-olds insult) fanning genuine fear and fake cures. But Contagion does have a heroine in Ally Haskell (Jennifer Ehle) a Bio-Safety Lab doctor with the expertise and guts to risk her life to find a cure. Its a treat to see Ehle a winning often underused actress in a crucial movie role. Her warm flinty performance first among equals in a strong cast is one of the prime lessons to take away from this intelligent Surgeon Generals advisory of a film. Another would be to wear rubber gloves and a cloth mouth-mask when you see Contagion. There might be a cougher nearby.

With simmering tension and some memorable acting performances by a stellar cast Soderberghs disease thriller is worth catching. TWITTER With an ensemble cast including Kate Winslet Matt Damon and Laurence Fishburne Steven Soderberghs thriller tracks the spread of a deadly virus that sparks worldwide panic. A shrewd unsensationalistic non-visual effects-dependent global disaster melodrama Contagion creates a credible picture of how the world might react (and up to a point has reacted) in the face of a rapidily spreading mystery disease for which no cure exists. Director Steven Soderbergh and screenwriter Scott Z. Burns create unease and simmering tension without going over the top into souped-up suspense or gross-out moments (with one possible exception) which will automatically lessen interest among the lowest-common-denominator crowd. But the fine cast likely solid critical reaction and undeniable topicality position this as a robust B.O. performer for the early fall season. The Warner Bros. release world premiered Saturday night at the Venice Film Festival. PHOTOS The Scene at the Venice Film Festival 2011 Spanning the planet but keeping his focus intimate Soderbergh plausibly sets up a scenario in which everyday human contact--people touching themselves others and ordinary objects--triggers an inter-continental plague that instantly transforms the way people relate to one another and throws governments and the relevant medical institutions into a panic. The immediate twin issues are how to combat the disease whatever it is and how to deal with a populace increasingly inflamed by rumors that thanks to personal electronic communications travel even faster than does the virus. Despite such familiar devices as ticking-clock calendar postings--""Day 14"" ""Day 131""--military checkposts the president going underground and so on the feeling here is far more realistic and science-based than artificially concocted. Notwithstanding the urgent struggles faced by the diverse group of characters including those such as the regular Joe played by Matt Damon the heart of the movie rests with the medical professionals played by Kate Winslet Jennifer Ehle and Laurence Fishburne individuals placed on the anvil of the crisis whose performance under pressure will likely tell the tale. The first symptoms are ordinary enough--coughing weakness a bit of fever. But nothing can prevent it getting worse. For Beth Emhoff (Gwyneth Paltrow) just returned to Minneapolis after a business trip to Hong Kong it takes only two days for her collapse start twitching foam at the mouth and die. Her son soon follows leaving her husband Mitch (Damon) both bereft and desperate that nothing happen to his teenage stepdaughter. PHOTOS Venice Film Festival 10 Movies to Know Reports of ""clusters"" of such cases have filtered in from Tokyo London and elsewhere so that by the fifth day the World Health Organization sends Dr. Leonora Orantes (Marion Cotillard) to Asia to try to identify the source. Dr. Erin Mears (Kate Winslet) of the U.S. Center for Disease Control sets up quarantine facilities in Minneapolis while Beths tissues are analyzed for clues as to the nature of the malady a must for a vaccine to be created. Congenitally opposed to such medical prudence and official explanations for anything is Alan Krumwiede (Jude Law) a rogue English blogger based in San Francisco who seems privy to lots of hard information. When rebuffed by the establishment press the rabid contrarian begins a one-man online crusade to expose an alleged conspiracy between governments and pharmaceutical companies to hide the truth and eventually produce a cure for maximum profitability even as he claims to possess a homeopathic remedy. Further skepticism of the health establishment is embodied by a genius Bay Area scientist (Elliott Gould) who quickly figures out the structure of the pathogen on his own; unfortunately Gould so engaging whenever he works with Soderbergh disappears after this initially flurry. Cotillard also gets short-shrifted as her character is sequestered by the plot for a long time. STORY Steven Soderbergh Confirms Career Shift From Director to Painter After a frenzy of activity by Dr. Mears who is a model of selfless medical dedication attention begins to turn more Ehles Dr. Ally Hextall a game researcher in the CDCs high-security lab who must run laborious tests on monkeys but keeps her eyes open and mind alert. Its a measure of the changing times that three of the most senior doctors involved--those played by Cotillard Winslet and Ehle--are women. Also forward in the frame is a morally compromised figure Fishburnes CDC Deputy Director Ellis Cheever a rational man dedicated to serving responsibly but in a pinch capable of committing a professional transgression for the sake of a loved one for which he is nailed by the relentless Krumwiede. STORY Hunger Games The Real Story Behind Steven Soderberghs Involvement The common man is represented by Damons Mitch who witnesses at close range the collapse of the social order and the rise of lawlessness. As Krumwides blog and no doubt others like it fan fears of food drug and supply shortages stores and homes are routinely looted. After four months or so of the epidemic some 26 million people have died with the number continuing to grow exponentially. While devoting most of their efforts to vividly dramatizing the alarming dimensions a modern plague could reach Soderbergh and Burns who hatched the idea and did research together cunningly underscore the adverse or at least equivocal role played by alarmists like the loose cannon blogger Krumwiede. Mindful of some of the most dire predictions for and reactions to such maladies as SARS Mad Cow disease and North American heterosexual AIDS its possible to both admire Krumwiedes fearlessness in taking on the authorities while also suspecting his motives and cry-wolf tendancies. In all events its an excellent character to have included and Law brings it home with compelling ferociousness. The pressure cooker plot calls for intense performances all around but first among equals are Winslet and Ehle. The formers abilities are amply known but whenever Ehle appears in films or onstage she makes it clear she entirely belongs in the company of Streep (whom she resembles) Winslet Blanchett Kidman Linney et al. She just needs to get a few of the choice parts. Shooting as usual under the nom de camera of Peter Andrews with the Red camera Soderbergh achieves an intimate you-are-there sensation throughout while working on superb diverse international locations. Cliff Martinezs score hums along very helpfully and without cliches. Only significant ""yuck"" moment comes during the autopsy on Paltrows character in which the doctors peel her scalp back over her face. Implicitly Contagion poses a rhetorical about how you split the difference between making an intelligent scientifically plausible film about something as alarming as a worldwide plague and creating a mass-audience entertainment sufficiently titillating in its catastrophic consequences to entice a huge public. Unsurprisingly Soderbergh has tilted closer to the former but is familiar enough with the latter to quicken the collective pulse a bit.
