Atafeh (Nikohl Boosheri) and Shireen (Sarah Kazemy) are two girls approaching adulthood the former from a fairly liberal and wealthy family and the second from a less cosy background. They go to parties drink and fall in love with each other. They even get involved with a dangerous scheme to dub Sex and the City and the film Milk into Farsi. While Atafehs parents react reasonably to her clashes with the police her older brother Mehran (Reza Sixo Safai) a troubled soul allies himself with oppression as a mode of survival and proceeds to make the lives of both girls a misery. With shades of My Son the Fanatic and The Lives of Others Circumstance tries to cram in a few too many issues and events but Keshavarzs deft handling of intimate moments and wise use of music keeps things grounded. The content feels familiar but the perspective is fresh.

"Circumstance (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Circumstance (R) This coming-of-age drama about two teenaged girls living in Iran differs from every other adolescent romance youve ever seen. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com10/12/2011 Editor rating 3 Circumstance the story of the budding romance between two high school girls is unlike any adolescent love story youve ever seen This one takes place in Tehran. The debut of writer-director Maryan Keshavarz who lives outside of Iran like much of her cast and crew (the film was shot in Beirut) would have been impossible to make in her mother country -- not to mention highly illegal. The cultural oppression of women is what makes the teenagers Atefah (Nikohl Boosheri) and Shireen (Sarah Kazemy) dream about moving to Dubai or somewhere abroad -- ""where we can be free"" one of the girls declares. Although they havent yet realized theyre in love with each other the inseparable friends have a connection that goes beyond a sisterly bond. When they watch American Idol and sing along to a contestants rendition of Bonnie Tylers Total Eclipse of the Heart they dance around the room while staring into each others eyes. To an outside observer they may seem like two girls who are just having fun. But to someone like Atefahs brother Mehran (Reza Sixo Safai) a recovering drug addict who has just returned home and harbors feelings for Shireen the teens attraction toward each other is obvious. Keshavarz who was born in New York City and grew up in the U.S. and Iran shows us how young people in Tehran get around the constrictive system pretending to attend sewing classes that are really raucous house parties and dancing at secret nightclubs subject to raids by the Morality Police (the literal name of the authorities who hound teenagers). When the two girls and their friends scan the shelves of a store of bootlegged American movies one of their pals suggests they dub Gus Van Sants Milk into Persian so as to start a revolution in Iran that would mirror the gay rights movement of the 1970s. Circumstance also often shows us the characters via security cameras mounted in the schoolyard on the street even inside Atefahs home. They are being watched everywhere they go There is no escape. There are times when the movie becomes too literal like a scene in which Atefah lashes out at her father -- a wealthy and powerful man -- for having to live in a culture he helped to create. The scene is unnecessary but Circumstance which won the Audience Award at this years Sundance Film Festival wants to give a voice to people -- especially women -- who are rarely heard in Iran. The fact that Atefah and Shireen come from radically different economic backgrounds is never a barrier between the two girls. They are open to anything their hearts still pure The world around them conspires to keep them apart and ensure their mouths stay shut and their dreams remain just that.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 07 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 240PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English About a sexy frank and politically contentious Iranian film two things can be known for a certainty (a) It sure wasnt made in Iran and (b) It wont be shown there either. Instead the writer-director is Maryam Keshavarz who lives in the United States who shot the movie in Lebanon using Beirut as a stand in for Tehran and who assembled her cast from expatriates fluent in Farsi. Yet this is assuredly an Iranian film for the crucial reason that Keshavarz knows her subject well. She has a truthful story to tell and unlike the characters involved the freedom to tell it. Screen grab from the online trailer for the Iranian film ""Circumstance"" Movies Circumstance The official trailer Although the broad theme is universal - a tale of star-crossed love - its the particulars of the setting and the citizenry that resonate here. Shireen (Sarah Kazemy) and Atafeh (Nikohl Boosheri) are 16-year-old schoolgirls who share a passion for music and for dancing and its soon revealed for each other. The former is an orphan whose parents met a dark fate in keeping with their profession - they were writers. The latter hails from an affluent cultured Bach-loving family. Her mother is a doctor her father a businessman and her wayward brother Mehran has just returned from a stint in drug rehab. Inside their home the atmosphere is secular and free-thinking with one exception To his dads dismay Mehran has replaced cocaine with religion that opiate of the masses and hes displaying all the zeal of the recent convert. What follows stitches a political allegory to a social document sometimes seamlessly but not always - the fit is occasionally jagged and forced. The allegory is fairly straightforward. Mehran embodies the state specifically the ""Morality Police"" who prone to their own moral lapses are as hypocritical as they are vigilant. Indeed the son has furtively installed surveillance cameras right in his family house. More intriguing though is the social document since its primary focus is on that disproportionately large segment of the Iranian population - young people and the illicit culture they inhabit. So we see Atafeh and Shireen dashing off to an underground club shedding their chadors to reveal miniskirts beneath and gyrating to the torrid beat of Persian hip hop. Cut to the stark contrast of their outing at a public beach on a summer day where the men can strip to their trunks for a swim while the women can only look on in envy obliged to stay hot and dry and completely covered. Keshavarz keeps alternating between these contrasting settings the observed proprieties above ground and the unleashed fervour underground. Then she adds a complementing shuffle between reality and fantasy. Dream sequences recur the better to capture the longings that abound in such an oppressive environment. In his slumbers Mehrans subconscious enjoys a tryst with Shireen; and the two girls dream of their own steamy coupling. Here and elsewhere Keshavarz shoots in stark close-ups punctuated by skewed aerial views reinforcing an acute sense of claustrophobia that has come to seem surreal. Other sequences are touchingly real and personal like the one where Atafeh shares a country walk with her father who sympathizes with her plight by recalling his own youthful rebelliousness against the Shah. His daughter loves him but the irony cries out and so does Atafeh ""You created all this for us with that revolution of yours."" Yes the film ranges widely and wildly in tone and style - theres a whole lot packed in here. And as the plot moves toward the climax where each girl is forced to make a hard choice dictated by her unique ""circumstance"" that feeling of compression of so many contradictory urges and needs vying for attention grows almost overwhelming. Such is life among the young in present-day Tehran up on the screen for all to see - all but those who most need to see it.

Unrated. 1 hour 47 minutes. At the Esquire. In Iran they like to watch. Or so we gather from the constant presence of surveillance cameras in ""Circumstance"" writer-director Maryam Keshavarzs sumptuous debut about Shireen and Atafeh best friends coming of age and burgeoning desire in Irans capital city Tehran. Schoolyards and streets alleyways and jail cells even the bedrooms of a home fall under the chilly gaze of mechanical eyes. Yet life and love happen -- vivid painful -- contrary to the watchers potential judgments. Atafeh (Nikohl Boosheri) comes from an affluent family. Orphan Shireen (Sarah Kazemy) lives with her uncle and her grandmother though much of her time is spent in the warmth of Aties home. Rebellious and vivacious the 16-year-olds guide us through a Teh ran that Westerners seldom see (though last years rock-band drama ""No One Knows About Persian Cats"" was a rousing introduction). This underground scene boasts the kind of dancing imbibing and yes hooking up thats sure to look familiar. Only the rules of the ""Mullahs"" -- as Shireen shouts furiously one intoxicated night -- make Prohibition-era speakeasies out of nightclubs and illicit hideaways out of book and record stores. (The movie was shot in Lebanon.) Atafehs brother Mehran (Reza Sixo Safai) is no stranger to this nightlife. But when the familys prodigal son returns from rehab household dynamics shift. Safai does rich work inhabiting Mehrans hankerings and hubris. Hes weak in the ways newly recovering addicts can be. He lashes out at his old life his old self. He takes to a conservative Islamic faith like a fresh addiction. And when outside forces begin to threaten his sister and Shireens relationship he becomes an opportunist. Stripped of its Iranian context ""Circumstance"" would still offer an interesting portrait of the love and clash between a mamas boy and a daddys girl. As it is the movie is rife with big ideas about patriarchy and fathers (not the same thing); about Persian societys class resentments; about how an accomplished mother might collaborate in curtailing her beloved daughters happiness; about parents remaining in a nation their children long to break free in -- or break free of. Yet for all its ambitions it never becomes a treatise. Keshavarz takes too much delight in the sensual for that. Her film is too much a wounded love story to slide into polemic. On a jaunt to the beach the family plays volleyball guys against gals not men over women. Afterward Shireen and Atafeh lie lazily near each other headscarves on. In the background a woman in a black chador pours tea. Her menfolk plop down shirtless in swim trunks. The composition is neither overstated nor throwaway. The friends arent paying much heed to the unfolding scene. We are. With this image Keshavarz argues -- ever so gently -- that these are the waters Atafeh Shireen and the others navigate. These are the riptides they swim against.

Comments click to enlarge Circumstance Rated R  105 minutes  2011 A free-spirited young Iranian woman begins to explore a secret sexual relationship with her best friend while her older brother finds new power inside their liberal middle-class family by aligning himself with the thuggish morality police of the Islamic Revolution. Despite his own carefully concealed drug abuse the brother takes it upon himself to install hidden security cameras inside the familys home so he can monitor everyones activities and his arranged marriage to his sisters friend sets the two siblings on a collision course. Written and directed by Northwestern University graduate Maryam Keshavarz this impressive 2011 debut feature generates plenty of erotic heat and Nikohl Boosheri in her first screen role gives a captivating performance as the sensually awakened heroine. But the movie is probably more important for showing how the brothers fundamentalism deforms the family dynamic forcing the kind-hearted father to kowtow to his priggish son.

Roadside Attractions Sarah Kazemy (left) and Nikohl Boosheri in ""Circumstance"" (Roadside Attractions) Atafeh (Nikohl Boosheri) and Shireen (Sarah Kazemy) are young women in love -- with each other. Their romance is something to be cherished but also something to be hidden. It could get them killed.As Iranians Atafeh and Shireen know that certain things are not allowed. Both fantasize about moving to Dubai where they would be free to do all the things that Americans take for granted -- such as wearing skimpy and sexually provocative clothing -- but that Iranians must do in secret. Even the underground clubs are constantly under threat of being discovered by morality police.Adding to Atafehs discomfort is the return of her brother Mehran (Reza Sixo Shafai) a former drug addict who is fast becoming a religious fanatic. The change in his behavior is all the more alarming because their family is by Iranian standards somewhat progressive. It all comes down to an unfortunate turn of events that irrevocably alters the relationship between Atafeh and Shireen.Written and directed by Maryam Keshavarz ""Circumstance"" offers an inside look at Iran in all its cultural complexity. While the film has an air of authenticity its also slickly shot (by Brian Rigney Hubbard) and its theme of youth rebellion has the potential to resonate with moviegoers who might otherwise have little interest in tales of political repression. Unlike the work of Iranian directors Abbas Kiarostami (""Taste of Cherry"") and Jafar Panahi (""Offside"") ""Circumstance"" seems designed to cross over to the mainstream. Boosheri and Kazemy while wholly believable as the main characters wouldnt be out of place in a music video. The camera loves them and the films more erotic scenes definitely take advantage of that. ""Circumstance"" was made reportedly with some difficulty in Lebanon. Shooting it in Iran would have been far too dangerous.""Circumstance""Three stars (out of four)  Rating R  Run time 148  Content Sexuality language and some drug use  Language Persian with English subtitles Find theaters and showtimes for Circumstance Sep 15 2011 (...)

Starring Nikohl Boosheri Sarah Kazemy Reza Sixo Safai Soheil Parsa Nasrin Pakkho Sina Amedson Keon Mohajeri Director Maryam Keshavarz Running time 147 Release Opened Sep 9 2011  Editorial Review Forbidden love in todays IranBy Ann HornadayFriday Sep 09 2011Revolutions large and small make themselves felt throughout ""Circumstance"" Maryam Keshavarzs sensuously subversive directorial debut about forbidden love in contemporary Tehran. So taboo are the films plot points - illicit house parties alcohol drugs and a lesbian affair - that Keshavarz had to film ""Circumstance"" in Lebanon. But she still vividly conveys Iranian culture at its most radically bifurcated where head scarves and public shows of piety may rule the day but far less orthodox impulses take hold in the shadows. Atafeh (Nikohl Boosheri) is a vivacious 16-year-old whose prosperous family has just welcomed her older brother Mehran (Reza Sixo Safai) back to the fold after a stint in rehab. When Atafeh brings her schoolmate Shireen (Sarah Kazemy) along on a beach weekend their close friendship blossoms into something more. As the two young women explore the giddy pleasures of first love their playful sensuous affair looks like any other teenage fling. But in Iran - where Mahmoud Ahmadinejad once famously insisted there is no homosexuality - Atafeh and Shireens blissful brush with romance fueled by pop music pirated movies and the thrill of the illicit brings them threateningly close to Irans ruthless morality police. ""Circumstance"" has its share of awkwardly soap-opera moments especially fantasy sequences involving Atafeh and Shireen that are heavy on close-ups of glossed lips and fingertip caresses. But like Bahman Ghobadis ""No One Knows About Persian Cats"" ""Circumstance"" offers a rare glimpse inside a closed society that for all the forces controlling it still sizzles and seethes with cosmopolitan life (all the while dodging the states weblike surveillance network). Keshavarz has cast mostly newcomers with surprisingly effective results especially the gorgeous Kazemy whose somber beauty and quiet focus give her character the gravitas she deserves. As the daughter of political journalists who were killed by the theocratic regime Shireen knows all too well the dangers that Atafeh takes in laughing stride. But the most crucial scene in ""Circumstance"" occurs between Atafeh and her father who reminisces fondly about the Islamic revolution before she reminds him of the repression that her generation now suffers as a result. Thats just the most explicit of myriad contradictions that ""Circumstance"" brings to light with nuance sensitivity and even wit - as when Shireen and Atafeh help a friend dub a bootlegged print of ""Milk."" The personal is political everywhere but maybe especially in Iran where youthful dissent is more likely to find a home on the dance floor than on the streets. For progressive change to take hold in Iran ""Circumstance"" suggests a new generation will need to harness both.Contains sexual content profanity and some drug use. In Farsi with English subtitles.

By Peter Rainer Film critic September 2 2011 Save for later Saved Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? ""Circumstance"" a first feature from Iranian-American writer-director Maryam Keshavarz has been getting a lot of attention for its risque subject matter. Atafeh (Nikohl Boosheri) a 16-year-old girl from a well-to-do Tehran family is best friends with her less privileged schoolmate Shireen (Sarah Kazemy) whose parents possibly executed were political dissidents. The friendship shades into a sexual relationship as they imagine running off together to live in more liberal Dubai United Arab Emirates. Keshavarz reveals the underground party scene in Tehran where warehouses and apartments stand in for clubs and the girls discard their head coverings and sport skimpy dresses. (The film was shot in Lebanon.) These sequences are more intriguing than either the girls dewy romantic confabs or the ensuing heavy-handed melodrama involving Atafehs Islamist fundamentalist brother (Reza Sixo Safai) a former hashish addict whose newfound mission is to root out ""infidels"" even within his own family. Despite its arty veneer and its ostensibly political edge ""Circumstance"" seems more interested in titillation than revelation. Grade C+ (Rated R for sexual content language and some drug use.)

More about Circumstance (Sharayet) >> Written and directed by first-timer Maryam Keshavarz Circumstance describes the friendship-turned-love affair between two 16-year-old high schoolers. Atafeh (Nikohl Boosheri) hails from a well-heeled and cultured Iranian clan. Shireen (Sarah Kazemy) lives with her uncle and grandmother - Shireens parents once outspoken critics of the conservative Islamic government are dead. (Circumstance was shot in Beirut Lebanon dressed up as Tehran.) The young women are soul mates. They share tastes in music in clothes in movies (theres a funny scene where they debate the merits and sexual implications of the banned movies Milk and Sex and the City). And soon theyre sharing intimate moments together and fantasizing about clubbing in lesbian bars in Dubai. (If only they could run away together to Dubai everything would be all right) The fantasy sequences with the girls in soft-core clinches are pretty - and pretty pointless. But in the restrictive universe of Iranian cinema the scenes can certainly be seen as provocative. Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

"Circumstance movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Circumstance Secrets and lies in a hidden IranCircumstance a 2 1/2 starsSeptember 08 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie criticSet in Iran but shot in Lebanon for obvious reasons the coming-of-age drama ""Circumstance"" stars two photogenic and expressive marvels Nikohl Boosheri and Sarah Kazemy as teenage friends and lovers living under the thumb of an oppressive regime.Modern-day Tehran comes alive in the underground club sequences of New York-based writer-director Maryam Keshavarzs feature.Yet the film wages an internal battle between its ripely sensual atmosphere and its often stilted pacing and plotting.Still those faces count for a lot. Raised in a wealthy and relatively permissive family Atafeh (Boosheri) has a brother (Reza Sixo Safai) coping with drug rehabilitation. Brother Mehran yearns for Atafehs best friend Shireen (Kazemy). And he is not alone -- he sees what is developing between Shireen and his sister.""Circumstance"" is a film about keeping secrets yet it does not keep many from the audience. Mehrans involvement in the volunteer Iranian ""Morality Police"" leads to ever-more-aggressive surveillance of his familys activities. An arranged marriage between Mehran and Shireen does little to solve anything.Winner of the audience award at the Sundance Film Festival Keshavarzs film works best when it accomplishes the least in story terms. The scene unusually transgressive for an Iranian setting of four young people dubbing the Gus Van Sant biopic ""Milk"" along with a standard-issue porno into Farsi works both as dry comedy and sociological commentary. By contrast Safais performance as Mehran sits heavily on the picture and not in an effective way.But when Boosheri and Kazemy are allowed to share a frame lighted with supple care by cinematographer Brian Rigney Hubbard ""Circumstance"" relaxes and shows us whats at stake here two human hearts under close watch but miraculously in sync.mjphillipstribune.comCircumstance -- 2 1/2 starsMPAA rating R (for sexual content language and some drug use)Cast Nikohl Boosheri (Atafeh); Sarah Kazemy (Shireen); Reza Sixo Safai (Mehran)Credits Written and directed by Maryam Keshavarz; produced by Keshavarz Karin Chien and Melissa Lee.

Oh and itas set in Iran. But it wasnt shot there. In Iran sexual scenes are not allowed female and male actors are generally not allowed to touch each other and women cant dance just for starters. So. Keshavarz an Iranian-American writer-director with family in both countries shot her film in Lebanon. She introduces a family in the relatively liberal elite of Tehran -- a subculture we dont exactly see very often onscreen -- but the film doesnt feel weighed down with the burden of representation Its too free-flowing for that too plot-heavy too stylish too romantic too hot. The first scene is a red-lit fantasy of the women shimmying in a night club. In front of a television playing bootlegged shows the young women shake their hips just like the kids on American Idol. Drunk they overdub Sex and the Citys orgasmic moans and gasps while giggling about their goofy transgressions then (when things get slightly more heavy) overdub Sean Penns cri de couers from Milk. They go clubbing slam shots snort lines argue about politics and then shimmy in lingerie some more. Worse one girl gets caught driving. Alone. Though President Ahmadinejad has declared that Iranian homosexuality doesnt exist it sure does here. A wry Nikohl Boosheri plays Atafeh the mildly rebellious daughter of a wealthy family who strikes up a dangerous affair with her bombshell-gorgeous best friend played by Sarah Kazemy. The two dream of a fresh start in Dubai where they presume they could love one another in a city with no history. At first it seems like their home is a sophisticated liberal island and theyre untouched by whats around them. But of course that doesnt last. Meanwhile the son of the family Mehran (Reza Sixo Safari) begins the film as a rehabbing party boy and finds a severe brand of faith. This leads him to become the house Inspector General installing video cameras to spy on his familys cosmopolitan island. Iranian filmmakers who cross over into American art houses (Abbas Kiarostami or Jafar Panahi) have become known for intense levels of realism (often featuring untrained actors) bare-bones production values and spare allegories. But Keshavarzs Tehran hews closer to the hard-rocking pop-addled Iran of Marjane Satrapis Persepolis and her style seems more indebted to the soapy excess of Douglas Sirk the warm lusciousness of Bertolluci or even Almodoovars kinky talent for mashing up the domestic and the profane the ludicrous and the weighty. The film shot lavishly by Brian Rigney Hubbard moves with a fluid rhythm -- and its few stumbles are of the most excusable overambitious sort. Brighton Rock As exquisite and flat as a sepia-toned vacation postcard screenwriter Rowan Joffes directorial debut updates Graham Greenes tale of crime on Englands Brighton boardwalk pushing the 1938 novel into the hurly-burly of 1964 when mods maraud all over the beach. Its also the last year of Britains death penalty which sucks for Pinkie Brown a dapper young hood who just killed a rival and must prevent a lovely young witness named Rose from sending him to the gallows. Pinkies cruel elegant solution? Seduce and marry her. That way she cant testify against him. Theres always the option to kill her later. Sam Riley plays this quiet bogeyman well enough but hes given little else to do but flip up his topcoats collar glower sneer and snarl. Half as complex as he was in the Ian Curtis biopic Control here Riley is too controlled by far. You never feel his fear or sense his charm. A creature of pure distilled malice Pinkie is all thorn no rose and its hard to see what Rose sees in this sociopathic freak despite the good looks. As this too-vulnerable waitress of quivering lip and unshakeable faith relative newcomer Andrea Riseborough makes Roses intertwined fear and naivete palpable but her blind devotion to such a clear sadist seem a better fit for the desperation of the late Depression-era novel than this films 64 surging youthquake. Shes so gullible their romance is all Pinkie amp; the No-Brain. The raw materials are all here for an epic criminal thriller -- a Brit Boardwalk Empire condensed to two hours -- but its a shame to see so many actors plinking just one note so well Helen Mirren is all brass as a streetwise redheaded dame who understands Pinkies game. John Hurt is all amiable grumbles as her ride-along gentleman friend. Andy Serkis as a suave and sadistic rival gangster shows he can persuade out of a mo-cap suit and leaves you craving more but his role as the ape leader Caesar was far more nuanced. Sometimes they all get lost under the waves of Martin Phippss heavy-handed score which threatens to drown out the action. Brightons ""not what she used to be"" says one gangster and that sure is a shame The 1947 adaptation was so much more and so much more strange.

Musetto View author archive Get author RSS feed Name(required) Email(required) Comment(required) August 26 2011 | 400am Modal Trigger Nikohl Boosheri (left) and Sarah Kazemy are wonderful as teen lovers in Tehran who dream of running off together to a more liberal Dubai. Irans religious fundamental ists cant be pleased with ""Circumstance"" a bold denunciation of their countrys intolerance especially toward women. It features sexy lesbian encounters bare skin alcoholic drinks and male-female dancing -- all of which are forbidden by Irans morality police. Shot in Lebanon using a cast of Iranians from around the world the film is directed by the talented Maryam Keshavarz who grew up in Iran before moving to Brooklyn with her family in 1967. She studied film at NYU; this is her first feature after making a series of experimental shorts. The story based in part on Keshavarzs real-life experiences revolves around a well-to-do liberal family struggling to cope with the intolerant regime. The familys son Mehran has just returned from drug rehab. Hes troubled to discover that his beautiful 16-year-old sister Atafeh hangs out at Tehrans underground clubs where men and women mingle freely. Hes even more distressed to learn that Atafeh is involved in a passionate relationship with another teen girl Shireen. His anger is such that he sets up surveillance cameras at home to spy on the two women. They meanwhile dream of running off to a more tolerant Dubai. There are superb performances by Iranian-Canadian Nikohl Boosheri as Atafeh the more rebellious of the two women and French-born Sarah Kazemy as the less-privileged Shireen. Reza Sixo Safai who grew up in California is strong as Mehran whose drug addiction is replaced by religious fervor. Brian Rigney Hubbards cinematography especially twisty shots from above gives ""Circumstance"" visual punch. With the Middle East now dominating headlines the film could not be more timely.

BY Joe Neumaier DAILY NEWS MOVIE CRITIC Friday August 26 2011 400 AM Circumstance - THREE STARSTwo Iranian girls keep their love a secret (146). Not rated. At the Sunshine and Munroe Film Center. In Farsi with English subtitles.A kind of spiritual cousin to ""Brokeback Mountain"" director Maryan Keshavarzs drama - filmed in secret in Lebanon and a winner at this years Sundance Film Fest - is mournful yet full of life. Atafeh (Nikohl Boosheri) and Shireen (Sarah Kazemy) are teens coming of age in a changing Iran. But the love they feel for each other has to be tamped down lest they shame Atafehs family who not only believe they know the girls secret but  have life plans for Atafeh that she must not upend. Though some things feel familiar - Atafeh is wealthy while Shireen is an orphan - Keshavarzs vision is clear and heartfelt and everyone has an urgency in their eyes.Special Treatment - ONE STARA therapist and a prostitutes jobs and lives intersect. (135). Not rated Sexuality. At Cinema Village. In French with English subtitles. Therapists heal thyselves and others in this French drama - and when that doesnt work prostitute Isabelle Huppert will do. Do what? A lot but that doesnt make this trite movie more interesting. Xavier (Bouli Lanners) moves in a world of bookish shrinks; Alice (Huppert) works her own type of therapy. As cliches trot through their sessions - its like ""In Treatment"" as bedroom farce - we check out. Huppert though is as fearless as ever.Brighton Rock - THREE STARSA gangster has to keep a witness to a murder hushed (151). Not rated Violence sexuality. At the Angelika and Lincoln Plaza.A beautiful-looking noir about a British gangster whose trap for a witness messes up his mob life. Pinkie (Sam Riley) is a flunkie whose dirty dealings are inadvertently witnessed by Rose (Andrea Riseborough) a young waitress. Pinkie romances her to keep her quiet though his charade gets him in even deeper trouble. Director Rowan Joffe updates Graham Greenes novel - set in the 1940s - to 1964 setting one scene amidst the mods-rockers clash in Brighton. Though he has a true appreciation for detail Joffe has the scar-faced Pinkie so scurvy that Rose ought to run the minute she sees him. (Even Hitchcock had charming murderers in ""Shadow of a Doubt"" and ""Frenzy."") Helen Mirren and John Hurt steal the show as friends all too aware of what goes on in their quiet seaside town.

The Weinstein Company By John Anderson August 26 2011 ""Our Idiot Brother"" about a preternaturally guileless hippie named Ned and his three weird sisters has a title designed to tickle Idiot brother? Some of us have one. Some of us are one. Its a title that seems to tell you everything you need to know about the film--like say ""Snakes on a Plane."" Just one more entry in the seemingly inexhaustible parade of loser comedies. Right? Not quite. View a scene from ""Our Idiot Brother"" starring Paul Rudd. Courtesy Weinstein Company. The muttonhead of the title is portrayed by the eminently likable Paul Rudd who has brought an ironic self-awareness to many slacker comedies a category that would include ""Our Idiot Brother""--if ""Our Idiot Brother"" werent also an allegorical social critique inspired by Fyodor Dostoevsky and his collaborator Jesus Christ. Directed by Jesse Peretz--and co-written by his sister Vanity Fair contributor Evgenia Peretz and her husband David Schisgall--the film finds comedy in contemporary mores; satire in hypocrisy; and inspiration in Dostoevskys ""The Idiot."" In that novel the hero Prince Myshkin possessed such goodness he was judged insane and sent to a sanitarium. Upon emerging his life is dominated by three sisters. Eventually he goes back to the madhouse. Likewise Ned sort of Its his innate decency that prompts him to give a bag of pot to a uniformed police officer; the cop whos been crying the blues to get the pot then insists on paying so he can properly arrest Ned for trafficking. Off Ned goes to the hoosegow where he becomes a popular prisoner and gets released early then meanders back to the organic farm he shared with his girlfriend the loathsome Janet (a great Kathryn Hahn) on the assumption that life as he knew it will resume. No way Janet has taken up with another airhead Billy (T.J. Miller) and unceremoniously evicts Ned from the farm. She wont even give him custody of Willie Nelson his very mellow golden retriever. Paroled and homeless Ned is remanded to that place where when you have to go there they have to take you in Moms. With his long hair beard blissful mien and empathetic nature Ned is the embodiment of those qualities we idealize in theory and often recoil from in the flesh pure goodness; an utterly frank nature; a propensity for saying the wrong (aka truthful) thing at the wrong time. While everyone in his dubious family extended and otherwise is painfully aware of Neds supposed shortcomings he is blithely oblivious to theirs. Which takes some doing Selfish and self-absorbed theyre state-of-the-art hipsters who provide themselves all manner of moral alibis through holier-than-thou lifestyle options. One sister Natalie (Zooey Deschanel) is in a committed relationship with lawyer Cindy (Rashida Jones) although she beds down with just about anyone. Another Miranda (Elizabeth Banks) a writer for a monthly magazine is happy to exploit Neds people skills to get a juicy story out of a high-profile subject--and to involve Ned in a cover-up when her ethics are questioned. Sister Liz (Emily Mortimer) and her husband Dylan (Steve Coogan) are helicopter parents. Oppressive. Superior. Hovering. When Ned offers their son a snack he is told in no uncertain terms that the young lad has already had his weekly cupcake. When Ned shows his nephew a movie on his laptop he is chastised by Dad. (""This country is obsessed with screens"") Nevermind that Dylan is a documentary filmmaker. Or that hes sleeping with his next subject a Russian ballerina. Ned meanwhile bounces like a beachball over the speed bumps of life always forgiving except of himself When hes hit on at a party by a couple interested in a threesome Ned tries to go along but ultimately cant--and then apologizes profusely for his inability to shortcircuit his own sexual orientation. Its a very touching scene no pun intended and not exactly apolitical. ""My Idiot Brother"" might have made Ned more of a symbol and less of a person. Where the filmmakers and Mr. Rudd go right is making him such a round and sympathetic figure rather than the desperate pathetic and/or slapstick character he might have been in different hands. ""Our Idiot Brother""--not ""My"" or ""Your"" or ""Their"" idiot brother--is goofily funny and silly and in many ways follows the currents of contemporary comedy into the gulf stream of inanity. And yet Ned turns out to be a strangely moving figure a comic foil worthy of affection perhaps even respect. ENLARGE Sam Riley and Andrea Riseborough in Brighton Rock. IFC Brighton Rock Graham Greenes conflicted Catholicism was the root of his novels spiritual gravitas--""The Power and the Glory"" (1940) being an obvious example. Less well-known is Greenes 1938 ""Brighton Rock"" a pulp-fictional tale of low-lifes scuttling about the English beach resort which has now been given a glorious gloss by director Rowan (son of Roland) Joffe. Expanded visually beyond anything resembling the comparatively claustrophobic 1947 film (which starred a wonderfully scrofulous Richard Attenborough) and imbued with a feverish morality that would have gratified Mr. Greene himself the film is almost distractingly beautiful to look at something that accentuates the tension between the films conflicting quantities i.e. the glories of the physical world and the corrupted humanity it hosts. In keeping with the current media mania for the early 1960s ""Brighton Rock"" has been updated to 1964 and the time of the Mods-Rockers riots. Its was an era when men were men and women were not and a naive waitress like Rose (Andrea Riseborough) could be swept off her feet by the likes of Pinkie Brown (Sam Riley) a not-quite-up-and-coming gangster who has killed a fellow hood and needs Rose as his alibi. As Pinkie wearing a nasty razor slash across his cheek tries to avoid being rubbed out Rose falls stupidly in love with him causing her devoted employer Ida (Helen Mirren) to try and rescue her from his clutches. In the midst of all the noirish goings-on the couples shared Catholicism provides a tortured moral backdrop to their relationship and to Pinkies criminality. His religion doesnt seem to affect his outlook on murder but it certainly governs his relationship to sex and marriage What should have produced cognitive dissonance seems to make sense to our ill-fated pair even as they swirl around the drain to perdition. Mr. Joffe keeps things moving and cinematographer John Mathieson (""Gladiator"" ""Robin Hood"") shooting in a widescreen format makes rapturous use of the sky and sea around Brighton where often below the lower edge of the frame ugly matters are afoot. View a scene from ""Dont Be Afraid Of The Dark"" Courtesy FilmDistrict. Dont Be Afraid of the Dark The original 1973 telefilm frightened a 10-year-old Mexican named Guillermo del Toro into becoming the pre-eminent fantasist of world cinema. So the remake of ""Dont Be Afraid of the Dark""--directed by Troy Nixey produced by Mr. Del Toro and starring Katie Holmes and Guy Pearce--would seem to promise a few revelations either regarding the state of cinema or the state of Mr. del Toro. What it has to say mostly regards the importance of casting. Mr. Nixey a comic-book artist short-film maker and del Toro protege forsakes the ha-ha-horror approach to movie dread in favor of an old-fashioned creepfest replete with creatures shadows and imperiled children--in his case Sally (Bailee Madison) who has come to live with her father Alex (Mr. Pearce) and his girlfriend Kim (Ms. Holmes) in a decaying hulk of a house infested with scurrying ratlike demons. The houses original owner who comes and very abruptly goes in the films gruesome opening flashback (the foyer of the story one might say) was a famous designer a la William Morris and if Alex and Kim can restore the house to its Arts and Craft origins they can get on the cover of Architectural Digest. Daughter be damned. ENLARGE Katie Holmes in Dont Be Afraid of the Dark. Miramax And the daughter dilemma is really the heart of the matter. Sally is an unhappy child shuttled from one parent to another; she feels unwelcome with either parent; she wants to go home without knowing where that is. Sallys initial reaction to the voices and creatures inhabiting the sealed-off rooms of the house is wonder not fear. The little fiends play to her weakness ""We want to be your friend"" they coo coaxing her to unseal the ancient ash pit where theyve been captive for a century. Between the music which evokes Bernard Herrmann and the flashing-camera conceit which suggests ""Rear Window"" Mr. Nixey is doing an Alfred Hitchcock homage within a movie lacking anything as subversive or skilled as Hitchcock. Its never explained but Sally carries around a 1970s-era Polaroid replete with bygone flashcubes with which she captures the creatures; a laptop yes would have been cumbersome. The special effects as per any del Toro project are convincing. The motivations less so. During one screening in Manhattan the film reached the point where young Sally has been traumatized for about the fourth time and Alex moans ""I have no idea what do."" ""I do"" someone piped up and the rest of the room erupted in laughs. When an audience is primed to scoff the movie has problems. Those problems include the performance of both Ms. Holmes who never seems to get much traction and young Ms. Madison who is everywhere and for very little reason. Cute sure; convincing no. Circumstance Among those matters generally filed under ""Mutually Exclusive"" are ""sex"" and ""Iranian cinema"" but theres genuine heat emanating from ""Circumstance"" director Maryam Keshavarzs stylish cry of outrage against Irans criminalization of all things youthful music dancing romance--the gateway drugs of intellectual adulthood. There will be complaints that ""Circumstance"" launches its attack on Tehran from a safe distance both culturally and geographically--the New York University-educated Ms. Keshavarz filmed clandestinely in Beirut--but this is not a documentary nor a solely political film Although the circumstances of the story involve theocratic oppression and rampant villainy this is a movie about longing desire desperation and the abandonment of principle--quite a collection of themes all universal. Its also supremely cinematic In her portrayal of the three principals--the privileged Atafeh (Nikohl Boosheri) the orphaned beauty Shireen (Sarah Kazemy) and Atafehs crackhead-cum-Islamo-fascist brother Mehran (Reza Sixo Safai)--Ms. Keshavarz uses the mechanics of moviemaking to create interior dialogues and expose the lie of religious fundamentalism. Although there is little that would be deemed explicit by Western standards there is one scene involving nudity and lesbian sex; one assumes it is the fantasy of one of the movies girls-gone-wild until Mehran wakes up and you realize that one persons pleasantly erotic sex dream would likely be a religious zealots screaming nightmare. ""If you could be anywhere in the world"" a voice asks at the beginning of the film ""where would you be?"" Not in present-day Tehran. But a screening of ""Circumstance"" wouldnt be out of the question. --John Anderson contributes film reviews and coverage to a variety of publications. Joe Morgenstern is on vacation. DVD FOCUS ENLARGE Clueless (1995) Perky fashionista Cher Horowitz (Alicia Silverstone) thinks her stepbrother Josh (Paul Rudd) is something of an idiot in writer-director Amy Heckerlings Jane Austen-inspired masterpiece of teenage manners. Cher eventually comes around of course and so have audiences ""Clueless"" a major career move for Mr. Rudd has long established itself as one of the more beloved films of the 1990s and one that captures a cultural moment as precisely and hilariously as any American comedy. It also co-stars Dan Hedaya as Chers father who warns her date ""I got a .45 and a shovel and I doubt anybody would miss you."" Control (2007) Sam Rileys breakout performance was as the suicidal Ian Curtis the Rimbaud of postpunk and the guiding spirit of the revered rock band Joy Division. The debut feature of Dutch music-videogapher Anton Corbijn ""Control"" chronicles Curtis relationship with his wife Deborah (Samantha Morton) the creation of Joy Division and his suicide in 1980 at age 23. With the exception of the number that accompanies the closing credits (""Atmosphere"") all Joy Division songs in the film are performed by the actors. Mr. Corbijn used his own EUR4.5 million (6.5 million) to finance the film--and he made his money back. Pans Labyrinth (2006) One of the great films of the past decade this Fascist-era fantasy is Guillermo del Toro at his best Otherworldy hallucinatory but always deeply human. Set five years after the Spanish Civil War ""Pan"" pits a deliriously lovely little girl named Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) against her new stepfather Col. Vidal (Sergi Lopez) a homicidal maniac hunting down rebel holdouts in the hills around his headquarters. Under the sway of faeries Ofelia finds a labyrinth under the house; meets a faun (Doug Jones) who will assign her three tasks; and ultimately discovers her fate. --John Anderson Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump New Sandy Hook Elementary School to Open Soon Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Donald Trump Lashes Out at Michael Bloomberg Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

The two explore Irans rebellious youth subculture together sneaking out at night to go clubbing and graffiti public property. Brian Rigney Hubbard/Roadside Attractions hide caption toggle caption Brian Rigney Hubbard/Roadside Attractions Circumstance Director Maryam Keshavarz Genre Drama Running Time 107 minutes In Persian with English subtitles Rated R for sexual content language and some drug use With Nikohl Boosheri Sarah Kazemy Reza Sixo Safai Soheil Parsa Nasrin Pakkho Watch Clips Club Credit Roadside Attractions I Love This Song Credit Roadside Attractions The incredibly overheated adventure of two girls in love Iranian-American director Maryam Keshavarzs Circumstance strains to convey the fever of adolescent abandon in a repressive land. But the drama set in Iran and filmed in Lebanon does contain episodes that feel true. Atafeh (Nikohl Boosheri) and Shireen (Sarah Kazemy) are 16-year-old classmates and best friends. Both come from liberal backgrounds but Atafeh is more secure because she has the support of her upscale family. Shireens parents were disappeared years before and at school shes regarded suspiciously as the child of enemies of the Islamic Revolution. By day the girls live mostly as the authorities expect. But at night they visit parties clubs and DVD stores -- all of them clandestine and illegal. Sometimes they join friends on graffiti ""bombing"" raids. Other evenings they retire to Atafehs bedroom to snuggle and kiss. (The makeout sessions are PG-13 stuff although Irans censors would surely rate them XXX.) Atafehs sense of immunity begins to fade when her older brother returns after an absence. Mehran (Reza Sixo Safai) has struggled with drug addiction -- heroin abuse is common in Iran -- and attended a rehab center where he found religion. At first he seems benign. But Mehran is now allied with the countrys morality police who are especially concerned with female transgressions. He uses his new connections as a source of power over his sister -- and ultimately her friend as well. Keshavarz was born and raised in the U.S. but spent summers with her cousins in Shiraz. Her depiction of Tehrans youth-culture underground partially corroborated by last years No One Knows About Persian Cats is exuberant and persuasive. Both films pulse with music thats officially forbidden or at least disdained. Atafeh and her father -- and previously Mehran -- share a passion for Bach and Beethoven. Atafeh and Shireen also listen to Iranian hip-hop American electro-punk and Bonnie Tylers 1983 cheese souffle ""Total Eclipse of the Heart."" Indeed Shireen dreams of becoming a chanteuse a hopeless ambition in a country where women are forbidden to sing in public. i Atafeh finds her lifestyle threatened by her brother Mehran (Reza Sixo Safa) a former heroin addict who emerges from rehab with a new frightening religious fervor. Brian Rigney Hubbard/Roadside Attractions hide caption toggle caption Brian Rigney Hubbard/Roadside Attractions Atafeh finds her lifestyle threatened by her brother Mehran (Reza Sixo Safa) a former heroin addict who emerges from rehab with a new frightening religious fervor. Brian Rigney Hubbard/Roadside Attractions Circumstance is best during its simpler more naturalistic moments. In one Mehran rebuffs a junkie who stumbles into the mosque only to see that an Islamic hardliner is more compassionate. In another Atafeh and Shireen are at the beach covered head to foot in hijabs. Then they hear the call to prayer and knowing that men wont be there to witness strip to their undies and go for a prohibited swim. Other sequences recounting the everyday harassment of young women by cops and cabbies are rendered with a heavier hand. But theyre necessary both to the story and to establishing the powerlessness of women under authoritarian Islamic rule. Some developments however are less plausible. The girls get involved with an Iranian-American DVD bootlegger who is dubbing Milk in Persian hoping to tweak the government with a movie that portrays a gay hero. And Mehran becomes a master manipulator taking control of his familys household and threatening Atafehs relationship with Shireen. (The friends fantasies of living free and sexy in Dubai are also a little much.) Made for less than 1 million with an international cast of Persian-speaking exiles Circumstance is in many ways an impressive achievement. But its mix of documentary detail and melodramatic plotting ultimately tips toward the latter. Ironically the movies principal audience is likely to draw from viewers who are more interested in sober reality than lurid fiction.

Sure its a lousy place to be a woman who loves women but its also not so great if youre an intellectual or a feminist or even just a fan of hip-hop. Writer-director Maryam Keshavarzs debut feature contains echoes of ""The Lives of Others"" and ""My Son the Fanatic"" but it stands on its own in its portrayal of everyday people trying to make the best of their circumstances in a restrictive society. Atafeh (Nikohl Boosheri) and Shireen (Sarah Kazemy) are best friends -- wealthy Ati lives in privilege (her father is a noted musician and her mother a Berkeley-educated surgeon) while Shireen has been raised by her grandfather after her parents both academics were killed by the government. They cant leave the house without headscarves or drive a car or even swim in the ocean publicly but like teenage girls everywhere theyve figured out a way to misbehave -- the pair take us on a tour of underground Teheran where afternoon discotheques (complete with drugs) flourish in apartments and barbershops hide secret stores full of contraband CDs and DVDs. (A visiting American-born Iranian wants to dub ""Milk"" into Farsi as a tool of revolution; his friend agrees only on the condition that they bootleg it on the same disc as a dubbed ""Sex and the City"" movie.) Ati and Shireens lives of down-low recklessness become imperiled by the return of Atis brother Mehran (Reza Sixo Safai) -- a failed musician-turned-addict he trades one drug for another namely religious fanaticism. Mehran joins the Morality Police a volunteer group of thugs who enforce the nations draconian cultural laws and he soon begins spying on his family. (Even more frightening we see how Mehran and Atis progressive parents slowly fall under the sway of their sons religious zeal.) During all this Ati and Shireen discover that they love each other and they make big plans about running away to Dubai to live openly. (Not that Dubai is all that far ahead of Iran when it comes to issues of homosexuality but thats another story.) The privileged Ati can bribe her way out of the country the film suggests but things may not be so easy for Shireen. Shot undercover in Beirut ""Circumstance"" allows a glimpse into the iconoclastic and dissatisfied youth who have played such a huge role in this years ""Arab Spring"" and in the current uprisings in Libya and Syria. And its the kind of movie to show to your parents or anyone else who gets swayed by a presidential candidate who says that he (or she) wants to run the United States based on ""Biblical principles."" Those of us living in the Western world get a little coddled about what theocracy really looks like and its a good thing to get a reminder every so often. While shooting in what must have been challenging circumstances Keshavarz still manages to get sterling performances from a Farsi-speaking cast containing many newcomers. The film looks great as well with cinematographer Brian Rigney Hubbard capturing everything from a secret rave party to a beachside jaunt to Atis dreams of luxury in Dubai in a way that makes each feel realistic and still contextual to the whole movie. Ultimately ""Circumstance"" isnt about religion or politics -- its about masses huddled or otherwise yearning to breathe free. And their stories are ones we dont hear often enough.

"Circumstance Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-EntertainmentMovie review CircumstanceTwo teenage schoolmates in Iran get involved in things likely to attract the attention of the Morality Police in this provocative drama.August 26 2011|By Gary Goldstein Special to the Los Angeles Times Sarah Kazemy left and Nikohl Boosheri in ""Circumstance."" (Brian Rigney Hubbard / Roadside...)With ""Circumstance"" writer-director Maryam Keshavarz offers a taboo-busting snapshot of contemporary Tehran a a provocative psychodrama thats part Iranian ""Girls Gone Wild"" set just before the 2009 elections. Shireen (Sarah Kazemy) and Atefeh (Nikohl Boosheri) are beautiful teenage schoolmates attracted to each other a and to a host of things considered subversive in their repressive male-dominated homeland; at night the young women boldly doff their head scarves slip into revealing dresses and then party away in an underground dance club. When Shireen and Atefeh help a gay director friend dub a print of Gus Van Sants ""Milk"" into Persian you can be sure their assistance wont go unnoticed a and not in a good way. Enter Atefehs fresh-out-of-rehab brother Mehran (Reza Sixo Safai) now an informer for the Morality Police whose new religious fervor masks a pitch-dark soul. Though theres a certain contrivance to Mehrans stealthy manipulations (how exactly did he install surveillance cameras in his unknowing parents house?) his presence ratchets up the tension and leads to an unexpected series of third-act events. Kazemy and Boosheri are excellent and Soheil Parsa and Nasrin Pakkho are also fine as Atefehs doting liberal parents. And if Keshavarz is less successful managing the films sometimes choppy narrative she is clearly willing to take risks on all fronts. More power to her. calendarlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESMovie review Go for ItMay 14 2011MORE STORIES ABOUTEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-circumstance-20110826,0,1639722.story?track=rss",200,circumstance22,circumstance,latimes

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Persian-American Maryam Keshavarz makes her feature debut with Circumstance the story of two young Tehranian women struggling against social norms. As it often does teenage rebellion bleeds into revolution (or counter-revolution here) Sarah Kazemy the daughter of disappeared intellectuals and Nikohl Boosheri whose parents are wealthy and connected go from hanging out at illegal parties to helping a friend dub Milk into Farsi. The parallels between Milks cultural rebellion and their own are hotly debated but the movie has covert resonance for the two women whose lifelong friendship has begun to turn sexual. Kazemy and Boosheri dream of escape to the relative freedom of Dubai but when Boosheris drug-addict brother (Reza Sixo Safai) returns from prison their options start to dry up. Safai comes home humbled but his parents distrust drives him toward Islamic fundamentalism and a position with the countrys Morality Police allowing him to look down at his family rather than the other way around. With little to do but seek out potential immorality Safai develops an obsession with his sisters relationship with her best friend eventually using security cameras to track them through the apartment. Keshavarzs use of multiple screens to convey the increasing intensity of his surveillance serves as an apt but clumsily executed metaphor for the countrys invasion of the private sphere. A scene where women in black veils bake in the seaside sun while men in bathing suits play on the beach before them more deftly makes the point that women in particular are not allowed to determine when they will or wont be seen. Theyre invisible sometimes all-too-visible at others. Keshavarzs staging of period Tehran (shot in Beirut) is compelling but her story plays like Sundance Mad Libs a disappointment given the settings potential. Circumstance is solidly constructed but without much in the way of inspiration. Its conclusion feels rushed and contrived particularly where Safais transformation into a vindictive zealot is concerned. Perhaps its unfair to compare Circumstance to the very different Persepolis but its hard not to drift off to Marjane Satrapis more pungent and personally inflected evocation of the same terrain in which the characters are as vivid as their surroundings.

In-love high-schoolers Atafeh (Nikohl Boosheri) a daughter of privilege and Shireen (Sarah Kazemy) living with her uncle and grandmother after the death of her regime-challenging intellectual parents dream of escaping to Dubai which in their frequently cut-to fantasies is a utopia of high-femme boites and chic hotel suites for Showtime-style sapphistry. The teenagers--who seek out clandestine centers of decadent pleasure where head scarves are discarded and immodest sequined party dresses are revealed--soon become the target of Mehran (Reza Sixo Safai) Atafehs older brother now a devout Muslim (and informer for the Morality Police) after years of drug addiction. Occasionally Keshavarz shows that she has the talent to make her points subtly--during a seaside outing that Atafeh takes with her family and Shireen the camera lingers just long enough on a woman in a black jilbab who is serving tea and snacks to three men clad only in swim briefs. More often though the writer-director re-emphasizes the obvious especially when Mehran installs spy-cams in every room of his parents well-appointed house observing the crimes against the theocratic state from his MacBook Pro.

The account of young Atafeh (Nikohl Boosheri) falling in love with fellow schoolgirl Shireen (Sarah Kazemy) -- before being pulled apart by events -- will draw invites from fests including generalist and gay-lesbian events. Pic has been picked up for U.S. release by Participant Media. Atafeh and Shireen are first viewed as typical Tehrani high schoolers though Shireen encounters regular difficulties with authorities being the daughter of two famed now-dead parents who were harsh critics of the Islamic Republic. While Shireen lives with her uncle and grandmother Atafeh enjoys a more stable nuclear family led by worldly Bach-loving dad Firooz (Soheil Parsa) and adoring mom Azar (Nasin Pakkho) who loves singing nostalgic songs. The girls know their way around the citys underground party scene where gatherings are held in private apartments or in warehouses converted into dance clubs. In these scenes Keshavarz shooting mostly in Beirut Lebanon captures contempo Iranian life more realistically than any current made-in-Iran film could Here when women enter a private interior they remove their head coverings and even strip down to racy dresses. ""Circumstance"" moves even further afield from censored Persian cinema when the gals grow physically intimate including vivid Dubai-set fantasies of frequenting lesbian bars and making love in lush hotel rooms. Such scenes will likely make the pic ineligible at most Mideast fests but will set tongues wagging in the widespread Iranian diaspora community where the pic is already a talking point. Keshavarzs script devolves into the ridiculous as it develops the poorly conceived character of Mehran (Reza Sixo Safai) Atafehs long-absent hash-addicted brother who suddenly turns up at home and just as suddenly nurtures an affinity for fundamentalist Islam. Incredibly and without Firooz knowing Mehran manages to install surveillance cameras in every room in the family house so he can spy on his ""infidel"" clan. This plus everyones astounding cluelessness about Atafeh and Shireens actual relationship sends the film reeling into a nonsensical latter half. As Mehrans power and influence grows over the family ""Circumstance"" becomes a loopy piece of psycho-paranoia in which all but Atafeh find no escape from the Islamic net pushing the film further away from contempo Persian realities even as it aspires to show them. Performances drift by the reel toward excessive melodrama with Safai in particular saddled with an impossible role. Tech package is close to mainstream European standards with d.p. Brian Rigney Hubbard working to modest effect in anamorphic widescreen. Gingger Shankar great-niece of Ravi Shankar manages some convincing Persian-style music with a soundtrack sprinkled with such pop Persian faves as Andy.

TWITTER ""Circumstance"" is an amazingly accomplished and complex first feature from Iranian-American writer-director Maryam Keshavarz. PARK CITY -- (U.S. Dramatic Competition) -- Drawing on some of her own experiences she has created an insiders look at a world few of us will ever get to see. The political sexual and religious labyrinth of Iran today feels at once contemporary and utterly foreign. Told with a modern rhythm and propulsive soundtrack its a compelling story that should attract both a young and older audience of culturally curious moviegoers. Keshavarzs looking glass is a liberal well-to-do family in Teheran and in particular 16-year-old Atafeh (Nikohl Boosheri) and her less privileged friend Shireen (Sarah Kazemy) whose parents were likely executed as dissidents. As any girls their age they are testing the bonds of friendship and their sexual attraction for each other made even more complicated by a repressive society that has little regard for women. They act out their rebellion by taking drugs and partying in hip-looking underground clubs but their only real escape is through their imagination. Life is so stifling in Iran that they picture themselves running off to the relative freedom of Dubai. All of Atafehs family has been affected by the totalitarian regime. Her once progressive Berkeley-educated father Firouz (Soheil Parsa) is nostalgic for his glory days while compromising in the present. Her mother Azar (Nasrin Pakkho) is a successful surgeon but nonetheless reminds her daughter that we have to accept the reality we live in. Most damaged of all is her brother Mehran (Reza Sixo Safai). A crack addict recently released from jail he is desperately looking for a way to fit in to society and not surprisingly turns to religion. His twisted sense of holiness leads him to become a member of the morality police and from his lofty perch puts his whole family under surveillance. Atafehs vitality and especially her life-affirming relationship with Shireen is more than he can stand and he sets out to crush it in a series of actions that irrevocably alters the close and loving ties that once bound the family members as allies not adversaries. Its within these crushing circumstances that people like Atafeh and Shireen do their best to find a modicum of peace and hope but it doesnt work for all of them. For obvious reasons Keshavarz shot the film in Lebanon and even there she had to stretch the bounds of what was acceptable. Having grown up in the U.S. and Iran she is able to look at the culture from the inside and has a keen eye for the telling image or subtle gesture ably assisted by cinematographer Brian Rigney Hubbard. In one striking scene at the seaside she frames a group of men lounging in bathing suits seated next to women in their black hijabs. On the other hand scenes of the girls buoyantly bounding down the street and partying in the clubs are shot in saturated colors contrasting with the drabness of everyday life. Drawing on relatives from her extended family Keshavarz clearly knows these people well and has managed to create distinct and individual characters on both sides of the political spectrum. In this she is aided by fine performances from relative newcomers Boosheri and Kazemy as the teenage girls and the sympathetic grace of Iranian stage veterans Parsa and Pakkho as the parents. Together the director and her cast have managed to give the film a sense of complete authenticity. At times however Keshavarz may have been too close too to these people and occasionally it feels like she is trying to squeeze in too much detail. Particularly in the early going the film seems like its simmering rather than gaining momentum. Some judicious trims would help that. But overall this is an impressive debut from a filmmaker with something to say and the talent to say it.
