Desperate for the wherewithal to feed herself her mother and her 12-year-old daughter a widow reluctantly decides to dress the child as a boy sending her out to work as a bakers assistant. Will Osama (as another kid helpfully names the understandably distraught girl) be found out? Certainly there are boys around who find Osama a little timid; more worryingly some mullahs seem to have their eyes on the beautiful teenager - out of suspicion or lust? This first feature out of post-Taliban Afghanistan takes a straightforward even unpromisingly obvious premise and transforms it into a film of power suspense and sophistication. Marina Golbahari outstanding in a non-pro cast is wonderfully watchful as the hapless young heroine. But what really raises the film above sentimentality and sensationalism is the rigour with which writer/director Barmak unfolds his narrative. He never feels the need to emphasise that the foundations of this society are built on fundamental injustices; thats a given which leaves him to explore more fruitful subtleties - a tree-climbing scene and one in which a mullah teaches sexual hygiene for example are especially resonant. Adding to this is Ebrahim Ghafuris elegant camerawork which strengthens an already forceful account of innocence unprotected. If Kandahar (by Mohsen Makhmalbaf who helped Barmak make this movie) was more topical this has a clear-headed intelligence and unflinching honesty all its own.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

Starring Marina Golbahari Arif Herati. Directed and written by Siddiq Barmak. (PG-13. 82 minutes. In Dari with English subtitles. At the Lumiere and Cinedome in Fremont).. Life for women under Taliban rule offered no prospect of happiness just degrees of misery. Faced with zero economic opportunity the 12-year-old heroine of ""Osama"" poses as a boy out of pure necessity not boldness. It is with great sympathy and even greater pragmatism that filmmaker Siddiq Barmak presents this heartbreaking powerful drama inspired by a real- life cross-dressing girl. The first film made in Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban ""Osama"" indicts the former extremist government by portraying oppression as part of the fabric of everyday life. The horrors of ""Osama"" are pervasive not acute so they take longer to sink in. But once in they stay there. Barmak opens with a sea of blue burqas -- women protesting their inability to hold jobs or leave their homes unchaperoned. Government agents respond to the peaceful protest by blasting the women with water hoses further dehumanizing them. Women widowed by the many Afghan wars have no options. When the preteen girl (Marina Golbahari) and her single mother lose their hospital jobs they have no means of feeding themselves. The plan hatched by the girls mother and grandmother is not elaborate. They cut her hair outfit her in a boys robe and send her into the world. Young Golbahari is affectless -- hauntingly so -- as the girl now renamed Osama. The fear and confusion clouding Golbaharis gamine face seem genuine; this kid doesnt appear to be equipped for major deception. Osamas high voice provokes suspicion at her Taliban boys school though an orphan boy (played with streetwise elan by Arif Herati) tries to protect her. He urges the girl to stay cool and not give herself away but she cant help shrieking after she climbs a tree and cant get down. When Osama is suspended over a well as punishment the girl emits agonizing cries for her mother. Barmak injects lyricism into the picture in small but highly evocative doses. We see from the girls point of view her barely formed views of the two genders. The thought of womanhood brings an image of those soaked female protesters but the male vision is of herself face uncovered and skipping rope before a cluster of women in burqas. But men and boys were tormented by the Taliban as well. In ""Osama"" men live under constant fear of reprisal when they are not being called upon to fight wars. The orphan boy is risking his freedom by assisting Osama as is a shopkeeper who briefly employs the girl. Life under the Taliban it seems was good only for the Taliban. -- Advisory This film contains violence adult situations. EUROTRIP Comedy. Starring Scott Mechlowicz Michelle Trachtenberg Travis Wester.Directed by Jeff Schaffer. Written by Schaffer Alec Berg and David Mandel. (R. 92 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.).. An unbilled Matt Damon shows up as a punk rocker in ""Eurotrip."" He provides the freshest moment in this pedestrian teen-sex travelogue -- and he appears before anyone ever crosses the Pond. Damons tattooed singer gloats about snagging recent high school grad Scotts (Scott Mechlowicz) girlfriend. His song ""Scotty Doesnt Know"" becomes a running joke worth a few chuckles as it follows Scott through Europe on the radio and in a nightclub dance remix. Scott and his buddies want to track down his German pen pal Mieke whom he has just discovered is a girl (he thought her name was pronounced ""Mike""). The gang hits tourist favorites like Big Ben and the Louvre while the script written by Jeff Schaffer Alec Berg and David Mandel (the team behind the dreadful ""The Cat in the Hat"") taps every European cliche. Theres a sleazy Italian a tiny Hitler aficionado English football hooligans and an ugly American who picks up his free T-shirt from the Amsterdam sex club where hes just been defiled. The winning young cast buoys the film for stretches. Newcomer Mechlowiczs regular-guy handsomeness makes him believable as a romantic lead and as the butt of his pals jokes. Mechlowicz shows a flair for physical comedy when his character duels with a ""robot"" sidewalk performer outside the Louvre mimicking the guys cheesy maneuvers and hydraulic voice effects. As the tourist armed with an expensive camera and chained to his Frommers guide (a constant plug) Travis Wester makes a likable stiff. Michelle Trachtenberg (from TVs ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"") as his twin sister is a bit too careful in her appearance to be plausible as just one of the guys. Her character is supposed to be so dudelike that the boys forget shes a girl. When shes looking for a rich European playboy one of the boys tells her that sounds gay. That brings us to a very prominent theme in ""Eurotrip"" gay jokes. The Italian molests the boys on the train and Scott is warned (when he thinks Mieke is a man) that the German is out to kidnap him. Teen sex comedies always have more homoerotic moments than you can shake a ... whatever ... at but ""Eurotrip"" seems overly concerned with penises and predatory men. This brand of humor a time-honored crutch for comedy writers is both lazy and unseemly. -- Advisory This film contains nudity sexual situations. -- KITCHEN STORIES Comedy. Starring Tomas Norstrom Joachim Calmeyer. Directed by Bent Hamer. Written by Hamer and Jorgen Bergmark. (Not rated. 95 minutes. In Norwegian with English subtitles. At the Opera Plaza Act theaters in Berkeley and the Rafael).. Scientific observation takes patience and intense focus. So does ""Kitchen Stories"" a Norwegian comedy that lacks an engine for its first 30 minutes. The film pays off eventually with a lovely story of friendship between two lonely men. Filmmaker Bent Hamer whose name suggests satire as a birthright based ""Kitchen Stories"" on postwar domestic studies in Scandinavia. Out to devise more efficient kitchens researchers observed 1950s homemakers performing daily tasks. The studies were conducted by an outfit called the Swedish Home Research Institute by the way and not by Ikea. ""Kitchen Stories"" imagines that these studies were instead performed on older bachelors. The films laboratory subject is Isak (Joachim Calmeyer) a Norwegian farmer of questionable hygiene who volunteered for the study because he thought it came with a free horse (it does but its a figurine). The Swedish researcher (Tomas Norstrom) assigned to Isak is so set in his ways that he is nauseated by having to drive on the right side instead of the left in Norway. The farmer is hardly a comfort cooking in his bedroom instead of the kitchen so the researcher cant do his job. That sums up the action in the first third of the film which is also short on dialogue. The researcher is forbidden to interact with the farmer whom he regards from a ridiculously high chair in the kitchens corner. (Dressed in a suit the researcher looks like an umpire at Wimbledon.) The visual gags alleviate the boredom of the first part of the film then the actors give the story its juice. Calmeyer lends a quiet glee to a scene where the farmer spies on the intruder via a hole hes drilled through a floor. As the staid researcher Norstrom turns the act of borrowing Isaks salt shaker into something illicit. The no-contact rules actually help the two reserved men start a friendship freeing them of the burden of small talk in getting acquainted. After several silent days the researcher notices that the farmers pipe is empty and tosses him a bag of tobacco. Isak responds with his first words ""Its time for coffee."" Once these two realize that theres an antidote to solitude they delight in their friendship and dismay the researchers boss. Norstrom loosens his expressions as it dawns on the researcher that life isnt all drudgery. But Calmeyer goes deeper portraying the farmer as a man who long ago shut the door on joy only to see it pried open by a Swede bearing a toy horse.

Osama Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2004) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/osama-2004,200,osama8,osama,rogerebert
"Osama a powerful look at living in fear - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Osama a powerful look at living in fear By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  February 20 2004 Some films you dont recommend to anyone looking for an easy time of it. Some films you recommend because they show what happened even as you wish you could look away. ""Osama"" the recent Golden Globe winner that opens today is the first feature film to be made in post-Taliban Afghanistan a country that unlike neighboring Iran never had much of a movie industry in the first place. It is based on a true story and stars an amateur cast who lived through much of what theyre reenacting. The details are specific to Kabul during the five-year rule of the fundamentalist mullahs but in its larger outlines this could have occurred (or be occurring) in any ideologically driven police state. Parallels to Nazi Germany Stalinist Russia and the Pol Pot regime -- even the civil rights-era South and ""The Handmaids Tale"" -- are there for the taking. At bottom however ""Osama"" works simply as the story of one unlucky young girl.We never do learn her real name. ""Osama"" is what the 12-year-old (played with pained clarity by Marina Golbahari) calls herself when she disguises herself as a boy and the name references Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden only inasmuch as it stands to raise fewer suspicions. In any event the girl doesnt have other options. Under Taliban rule women are not allowed outside their houses without a male escort from their family -- the punishment is death by stoning -- but the girls father and uncle have both been killed in the wars and the hospital where her mother (Zubaida Sahar) worked has been closed. Cross-dressing is the only way Osama can feed her family.As directed with poetic bluntness by Siddiq Barmak (who ran the Afghan Film Organization before 1996 when the Taliban sent him fleeing to Pakistan; he returned to his homeland after the regime fell in early 2002) the film is anything but a profile in courage. The girl is at all times terrified of discovery and even with her hair cropped short and her face hardened into an unconvincing glare the audience stays on edge too. Taliban foot soldiers loom around every corner their eyes aflame with zeal their mouths dispensing obscenity-laden warnings to anyone not in lockstep with Allah. Because they see only what they want to see they never quite see her.Its a different matter with kids her own age. A wily street urchin named Espandi (Arif Herati) tries to extort a few pennies from Osama but then becomes her protector when the Taliban start rounding up Afghani youth to provide Al Qaeda with fresh recruits. The girl is sent to a training camp in the mountains where she has to get through a communal bathing ritual with an old goat of a mullah -- a scene that would be played for ribald comedy in a Hollywood film it carries a helpless free-falling danger here.The movie regularly pulls back to give a wider view of a country prostrated by fanaticism. The opening sequence in which a protest march led by women in blue burqas is dispersed by soldiers wielding rifles and firehoses has a you-are-there immediacy and you sense throughout that Barmak is committing his story to celluloid as quickly as possible before memories fade. The fear that wracks the features of the young lead actress seems on loan from very recent events while Ebrahim Gharfuis cinematography locates the threat in every smoky wasteland and quiet alleyway. The only thing he cant find is a place where a child can hide.(""Osama"" 1/2) Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

"An Afghan girl becomes a boy in Osama. Slate Sign In Sign Up An Afghan girl becomes a boy in Osama. An Afghan girl becomes a boy in Osama. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Feb. 13 2004 615 PM Lady and the Taliban An Afghan girl disguises her gender in Osama. By David Edelstein No empowerment in this cross-dressing tale Its no secret that women had a lousy time under Afghanistans murderously repressive Taliban regime but the new film Osama (United Artists) memorializes their misery in powerfully mythic fashion. Set in the early days of the new government the movie--the first to be made in that country since the Taliban was driven from power--tells the story of a pubescent 12-year-old girl (Marina Golbahari) ordered by her starving mother and grandmother to pass herself off as a boy so that she may work in a shop. Her father was killed in one of sundry battles; the hospital in which her mother worked has closed--leaving the patients with nothing much to do but die; and theres no one else to put food on the table. The film opens with a demonstration in which women who call for the right to work are violently dispersed by (unseen) Taliban soldiers. That rally gives the first-time director Siddiq Barmak a chance to show off his  gift for color and composition The women their heads covered in violet burkas are like a sea of bobbing man-o-war. Later at a wedding party they show their faces but are fast to flip their burkas over their heads when the Taliban come pounding on the door. Here the director displays his dry sense of humor Their sudden swaying and moaning is over-the-top; now they look like a sea of Cousin Its. Marina Golbahari as Osama Advertisement In dramatic terms Osama couldnt be much simpler. The director is aiming for a sort of tone poem of repression the girl robbed first of her childhood then of her burgeoning womanhood. What you see isnt surprising but living through it--experiencing the cruel and arbitrary justice of the Taliban through a 12-year-olds eyes--puts a knot in your stomach that lasts beyond the films closing credits. Thats in spite of the fact that the protagonist is a little dull. Shes a beautiful girl--at times positively Garboesque--but passive incurious paralyzed by fear. She makes no attempt to drop her voice or cover her bare ankles when her employer (whos in on the deception) warns her that she sounds and looks too much like a girl and she doesnt put up much of a struggle when surrounded by boys who jeer her. The director is setting her up to be a martyr and the girl never experiences anything like the sense of liberation that most female protagonists feel in cross-dressing dramas. Of course the female protagonists in other cross-dressing dramas arent constantly being scrutinized by glowering bearded men poised to have them publicly stoned to death. Its fascinating to watch the Taliban officials as they size up ""Osama"" (the name is given to her by a boy played by Arif Herati who first blackmails her and then ends up as her protector); they regard the prospect of his femininity with something like terror as if they cant be responsible for their actions at the sight of a dainty ankle. The films most fascinating moment comes when an elderly mullah teaches the pubescent boys--future Taliban soldiers--the ritual of washing their private parts then casts his eyes on ""Osama"" and is plainly aroused. He says ""Osama"" looks like a nymph--a boy who sings like a girl in heaven. But hell be the one to deliver her to hell. Its the horrific images that keep you watching the listing turbaned Taliban informer framed by an arch in a long alleyway staring at ""Osamas"" front door of as if trying to discern some secret knowledge; the shot of ""Osama"" against a malignant white sky in the upper branches of a tree where she has climbed to prove that shes a boy (but proves otherwise by being too terrified to come down); the hard shaft of day in the boys dark bath house like a spotlight waiting to illuminate the terrified girl. A little boy limping out of the abandoned hospital into the rubbled street--maybe the director is pushing it with that one. Its the casualness of the Talibans oppression that gives these images an extra charge. The movie opens with a Nelson Mandela quote ""I cant forget but I can forgive."" Theres no chance of forgetting after Osama but little change of forgiving either. Correction Feb. 17 2004 An earlier version of this piece referred to director Siddiq Barmak as a woman. Barkmak is a man. (Return to the corrected sentence.) David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air.

Marina Golbahari in a scene from the motion picture Osama. By Wahid Ramaq United Artists This combination has been known to spur big-screen passion made on a budgetary dime to break out internationally. A powerful ending doesnt hurt either after first-time director Siddiq Barmak hits his stride in the storys second half. Before ""Osama"" adopts this name in disguising her sex she (Marina Golbahari) is a 12-year-old girl facing the mandated life that existed before the Talibans reign in Afghanistan abated. This was the first homeland film produced after that happened. Women such as her widowed mother and grandmother cant even walk outdoors unless accompanied by a male. So how does one work -- or for that matter eat -- in an exclusively female household? This maturing girl has a delicate beauty that eventually does her no good. Her features also border on the androgynous to help her pass as a boy even though suspicious young male minds abound once shes whisked away from brief employment to attend a Taliban school. A savvy street panhandler (Arif Herati) protects her from taunting classmates but hes no match for adults. About the show Osama  1/2 (out of four) Stars Marina Golbahari Arif Herati Director Siddiq Barmak Distributor United Artists Rating PG-13 for mature thematic elements Opens in select cities Friday The standout villain in a community of them is the bearded paunchy mullah who hauls the boys into a kind of steam room to teach them the proper 1-2 way to wash their genitals after nocturnal emissions. ""Taliban perv"" isnt a concept you think about every day but any viewers radar will commence blaring sounds within moments of this creeps arrival. Though consumed by Osamas plight (which gets worse) the movie verges on a matter-of-fact approach to other horrors -- no doubt reflecting what the people must have felt under constant threats. A Western journalist is executed for taking pictures; a woman is sentenced to be stoned for ""advocating profanity."" Meanwhile the youngsters seem to welcome the Taliban instruction mostly because they like the turban look. Osama was the fledgling Afghanistan film industrys official foreign-release Oscar submission and its failure to get a nomination is surprising. Its social consciousness and deft storytelling is a mix that ususually hits academy voters where they live.

A blinding barrage of women in burkas parades through the streets of Taliban-ruled Kabul demonstrating on behalf of the right to work. ""Come see the revolution"" proclaims a Dickens-worthy street urchin speaking to the man with the movie camera a journalist of unspecified nationality who is recording the protest. Then a panicked cry -- ""The Taliban are here"" -- followed by eruptions of unseen gunfire and blasts of pressurized water scattering the marchers like so many bits of unwanted sediment hosed down a suburban driveway. After which the attention of the Taliban authorities turns to the ""infidel"" journalist as they proceed to batter him causing the camera to come unstuck from his hands and the images before us to smear into an indecipherable blur. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - One of these women (Zubaida Sahar) accompanied by her 12-year-old daughter (Marina Golbahari) manages to find shelter from the chaos and the rest of Osama is about how this all-female family (which also includes an elderly grandmother) attempts to survive in a country where women are not merely forbidden to hold jobs but to so much as walk unaccompanied in the street or talk to strangers. Sahars character whose husband and brother were both killed during Afghanistans endless series of internal and external conflicts surreptitiously works as a nurse at a foreign-run hospital which is soon shut down by the Taliban who go on to take many of its international aid workers prisoner. The woman laments ""I wish God hadnt created women"" And therein lies the seed of a desperate idea The woman will disguise her daughter as a son Osama and send ""him"" off to work to support the family. As some viewers will recall a similar premise propelled director Majid Majidis 2001 film Baran in which an apparently male Afghan refugee working on an Iranian construction site is eventually discovered to be a woman. Like that film Osama is at times too indebted to the cinematic convention of cross- dressing tales hinged on the suspense of potential revelation. But unlike just about every movie that has thus far emerged on the subject of the troubles in Afghanistan (including several made by the Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf who donated much of the funds and equipment used to make this film) Osama offers us what feels like a true insiders view free from condescension and the temptation to view the countrys persecuted citizens as merely pitiable ""others.""

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm Barmak directs with considerable visual flair alternating bold confident traveling shots with simple lyrical images like that of a pair of sandaled female feet dangling (too suggestively for Taliban tastes) from the back seat of a bicycle. He also makes particularly effective use of a monaural soundtrack isolating key sounds to pull us slowly into his scenes at the center of which invariably lies the stunning Golbahari a nonprofessional who recalls some of Bressons most haunting model-actors in her intense anguished grace. Perhaps most significant given that the film is the first to complete production in Afghanistan since the Taliban was ousted from power is Barmaks decision to set his story during the regimes heyday. It is in effect his manner of reminding us of the way things were in his country five minutes ago and how rash it is to think that the situation has entirely remedied itself just because CNNs cameras have since moved on to Iraq.   Jafar Panahis Crimson Gold also grips us with a startling start and one that is particularly unusual and daring in Iranian cinema An armed robber holds up a Tehran jewelry store at gunpoint killing the owner and ultimately himself. Its an event torn from actual newspaper headlines but one that has nevertheless resulted in Panahis film being banned in its home country where the subject -- let alone the act -- of suicide is verboten. Crimson Gold then loops back on itself to show but not necessarily to explain (or rather to necessarily not explain) the impulses leading up to that spasmodic burst of violence. Scripted by the master Iranian filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami for whom Panahi once worked as an assistant (and whose own Taste of Cherry ran into censorship problems of its own by featuring a main character who merely contemplated taking his own life) Crimson Gold is less explicitly about suicide than about a general condition of despair that casts itself over the denizens of Tehran like a thick cloud of automotive exhaust. For Hussein (Hussein Emadeddin) a petty thief and part-time pizza deliveryman that condition is heightened by his inability to come to terms with the fact that in a society marked by deep divisions between classes he is most conspicuously one of the have-nots. Upon their first attempt to buy a wedding gift for Husseins fiancee Hussein and his future brother-in-law are both refused entrance to an upscale jewelry store in the ""good"" part of town. Later when they return cleaned up and in better clothes theyre admitted only to then be told by the owner that they might want to invest in something that can be ""more easily liquidated should the need arise."" As embodied by the real-life schizophrenic Emadeddin Hussein is a bear of a man with spaced-out eyes and a delayed manner of speaking that causes him to appear permanently lost in some private reverie. For much of the film he traverses Tehran from its poorest tenements to its most glittering penthouses a passive voyeur and our guide to momentary glimpses of how life is lived in those places. (Pizza Panahi and Kiarostami comically suggest is the great equalizer -- an idea that culminates in a brilliant set piece in which a rich playboy flustered following an argument with his girlfriend invites Hussein in for dinner and a tour of his ostentatious bachelor pad.) Over time we gradually pick up more details about the character that he was once a soldier who served in military intelligence that he is now heavily medicated on cortisone and that despite his sullen unresponsive demeanor people generally like Hussein. Yet fascinatingly and frustratingly nothing specifically accounts for his ultimate lashing out; no individual moment is offered up as the sort of ""psychological break"" weve been conditioned to expect from countless other movies and their Freudian character logic. Rather Crimson Gold is like the society it depicts an unbalanced chemical equation with Hussein its free radical. This marks something of a departure for Panahi whose three previous features The White Balloon (also scripted by Kiarostami) The Mirror and The Circle while all affecting and impressively styled felt a tad too calculated a bit too concerned with making sure all of their symbols and meanings and clever ruptures of linear narrative added up to some readily discernible payoff. In Crimson Gold Panahi seems at last to speak with his own beguiling cryptically beautiful expressiveness which grows ever more absorbing with each of its purposefully irresolute turns. The result is the work of a funereal yet darkly funny neorealist sounding the rallying cry against the inflexible maxim casually delivered by one of his own films characters ""It all existed before us. It will all go on after us.""

Father and brother have been killed; women are forbidden in public without a male family member; at least a ""son"" can travel freely to earn a wage. A scrappy local kid figures out the ruse but keeps the secret and gives her a resonant alias. And thus the sad and stunning drama Osama has nothing to do with the al-Qaeda terrorist bin Laden but everything to do with the hopelessness and oppression that marked the Talibans fundamentalist rule in Afghanistan. The movie is a rare uncensored postcard from a ruined place a document at once depressing and hideously beautiful that sketches the real hardships of trampled people - specifically women - with authority and compelling simplicity. The first entirely Afghan production since the Talibans fall ""Osama"" is also a feat of understated authenticity. Siddiq Barmak in his feature directorial debut shot in Kabul with a largely nonprofessional cast including Marina Golbahari who plays the terrified title character with piercing believability. Every detail of her bewildering new life threatens to give the girl-as-boy away from her unfamiliarity with the way men pray to her high voice; and its easy to assume that Golbahari born in 1991 wasnt acting fear but feeling it. Rounded up with the boys by the Talibans religious police and sent to a compulsory religious school the disguised girl is thrown even deeper into danger. There is be warned no happy ending. There are though details of such well-chosen specificity that Barmak compresses whole sub-dramas into single shots An old mullah modestly demonstrates the proper ritual washing of the genitals to a crowd of skinny naked boys; a foreign photographer is arrested for being a foreign photographer. And every time a woman matter-of-factly dons the head-to-toe burka that erases her female personhood were shocked anew by what ""Osama"" tells with the intimacy of an everyday diary entry.

She is poor female and 12 and in mid-90s Afghanistan with the Taliban thug clerics in power that means no schooling employment or respect. Then her mother has an idea. Cut the girls hair dress her in robes and give her a boys name -- Osama -- so she can find work as a ""boy"" and support the tattered family. The plot of Siddiq Barmaks Osama sounds like a twist on an old story. Its an unsentimental Yentl or -- considering the eerie resemblance of Osamas Marina Golbahari to Hilary Swank -- an Afghan Boys Dont Cry. In 2001 Iran produced a similar fable Baran set among illegal Afghan refugees in Tehran. But life has ways of imitating art. Osama the first feature made in Afghanistan since the Taliban seized power is based on a true story. And truth shines through every frame thanks to Barmaks storytelling skill and his young stars unaffected radiance.

Everyone notices that this Osama is different -- ""like a nymph"" one man says. After landing a menial job the girl is taken to the men-only prayer ritual where each lad is instructed in the proper washing of the male genitals. Her deceit is discovered when she has her first menstrual period and she is married off to an old mullah. Heartfelt and handsomely made Osama is the story not just of one unfortunate girl but of a nation besieged by autocratic theocracy. The film roams Kabuls streets for vignettes of the regimes depredations. When a Taliban inspector arrives at a hospital where a female doctor is treating an old man the doctor must conceal herself by quickly donning a burqa and claiming she is the wife of her patients son. A film like this from a country like Afghanistan might seem a curiosity. It is more like a miracle. When the Taliban took over in 1996 it torched theaters burned thousands of reels of film. Barmak then head of the state-run Afghan Film Organization fled Kabul and made documentaries for Northern Alliance leader Ahmed Shah Massoud (later assassinated by al-Qaeda). After the regimes overthrow he returned to make educational films for the illiterate majority and toured the country with eight cinema caravans which also screened old Chaplin and Keaton comedies. ""Our technical guys cried"" he says. ""It was the first time they had seen people laugh in years."" Barmak found his Osama leading lady on a Kabul street a girl approached him begging for money. ""Her eyes"" he says ""were like an explosion of light."" Golbahari didnt need to reach deep for the emotions she was to show onscreen. ""He asked what made me sad"" she says. ""I thought about my sisters who died during the war and I just started crying."" Afghanistan whose headlines for years read like a wail of pain has had many reasons to cry. Now its citizens can laugh and cry at the movies. The rest of us can cheer.
