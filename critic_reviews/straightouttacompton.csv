The movie also highlights with justified outrage the abuses inflicted by the police against black people--and in particular on N.W.A.s members--that gave rise to the famous song ""Fuck tha Police."" The director F. Gary Gray emphasizes the hits importance by filming a performance of it in Detroit as a bravura showpiece. The cast--headed by Corey Hawkins as the musical mastermind Dr. Dre; OShea Jackson Jr. as the ingenious lyricist Ice Cube (who is also Jacksons real-life father); and Jason Mitchell as Eazy-E the entrepreneurial drug dealer who financed the groups record label and starred on its first hit--maintains an energized conversational rapidity. But the personal lives of the musicians are mere backdrop. The core of the story is business the object is power and the quirks of desire and twists of the unconscious are given no place in the struggle--which the movie sharply carries ahead to the present day.      --Richard Brody Goings On A free New York City events app What to do tonight Follow goingson About Us FAQ Strongbox Customer Care Cartoon Bank On The Town RSS Contact Us The New Yorker Store Careers Reprints/Permissions Press The New Yorker Media Kit Conde Nast Digital Subscribe to a magazine View All Titles - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Bon Appetit Brides Conde Nast Traveler Details Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Lucky Self Teen Vogue The New Yorker Vanity Fair Vogue W Wired Other Conde Nast sites - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Ars Technica Bon Appetit Brides.com Conde Nast Traveler Concierge Details Epicurious Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Hotel Chatter Jaunted Lucky NutritionData Reddit The Scene Self Style Teen Vogue Vanity Fair Vegas Chatter Vogue W Wired Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement (effective January 1 2014) and Privacy Policy (effective January 1 2014).

"Straight Outta Compton - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Straight Outta Compton Posted by Christy Lemire on August 21 2015 1 Comment Universal Pictures Rated R for language throughout strong sexuality/nudity violence and drug use. Running time 147 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four. For a movie about a groundbreaking risk-taking group like N.W.A. ""Straight Outta Compton"" is surprisingly conventional in its adherence to music biopic tropes. The rise-fall-rise-again structure the groupies and the drugs the beefs over money and acclaim and the general mayhem that gets magnified when egos get in the way -- its all there. Youve seen it all a million times before (which is why the parody ""Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story"" which I love dearly is so brilliantly spot-on). But in its execution ""Straight Outta Compton"" is so electrifying and so powerfully acted you probably wont mind. Director F. Gary Gray starts strong by depicting the seminal rap groups early days on the mean streets of L.A. with great intimacy and verve. (The great Matthew Libatique Darren Aronofskys longtime cinematographer bathes these mid-80s scenes in a warm haze of late afternoon sunlight pot smoke and nostalgia.) Seeing young scrappy Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins) Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell) and Ice Cube (OShea Jackson Jr.) hustling to make a name for themselves is a visceral thrill and all three of these key roles were expertly cast. It may sound like a gimmick to have Ice Cubes son playing Ice Cube -- and damned if he doesnt look exactly like a younger thinner version of his dad -- but hes also got the glare and the swagger down cold and he more than rises to this formidable challenge in both the dramatic moments and the stage performances. ""Straight Outta Compton"" is surprisingly funny off the top though as these guys and their pals (including Neil Brown Jr. as DJ Yella and Aldis Hodge as MC Ren) tool on each other mercilessly both in and out of the studio while recording their first tracks. Paul Giamatti is also beautifully brash as their decidedly uncool white manager Jerry Heller the first person who ever believed in N.W.A. (and later a surprisingly moving source of ambiguity and poignancy). But even through the good times and wild parties (where women dismayingly are depicted as little more than objects and playthings) as the groups fame and influence are on the rise theres a constant simmering undercurrent of tension. Between poverty and drugs gang battles and police brutality -- the very fiber of the rap groups lyrics er go we have a little ditty called ""Fuck Tha Police"" -- theres the pervasive threat that something terrible could happen at any point. And it often does. Sometimes the highs and lows coexist in the same moment as in the recreation of the notorious night in 1989 when N.W.A. performed ""Fuck Tha Police"" at a packed Detroit concert -- which theyd explicitly been told not to do -- sparking rioting and chaos. In contrast with the first part of the film this segment is glossy crisp and vibrant; its such a massive blast and its so immersive it makes you feel like youre a part of the audience or at least wish you had been. The pace slows though as the three begin mistrusting not only each other but also their manager. Its no less significant in the groups development -- after all these rifts led to Ice Cube and Dre forging formidable solo careers. But the films final third turns quieter less flashy and more introspective especially as the once-dynamic Eazy-E finds his health failing him. (He died of AIDS in 1995 at just 31.) Yes there is some revisionist history going on as is so often the case in bringing a famous persons life to the screen. As my friend and fellow critic Andrew Barker points out this is glaringly true in the scene where Dre ""comes up with"" the synth riff for ""Nuthin But a G Thang""; also Dres history of violence against women has been omitted entirely. (He Ice Cube and Eazy-Es widow serve as producers on the film.) And if youre a neophyte and dont know the significance of Suge Knight (R. Marcos Taylor) or Tupac Shakur (Marcc Rose) in this whole twisted hip-hop saga the script from Jonathan Herman and Andrea Berloff isnt about to go out of its way to enlighten you. At the same time the film unfortunately couldnt be more relevant; the same bloody racial struggles with police Ice Cube wrote about nearly 30 years ago are still going on today in cities across the nation which gives it an added a layer of pointed commentary. None of that stops ""Straight Outta Compton"" from being entertaining as hell though from start to finish. And based on the screening I attended its very easy to imagine sing-along showings cropping up for years to come. Tweet Category Reviews Tags Aldis Hodge biopic Corey Hawkins Dr. Dre Eazy-E F.

By Tyler Daswick click to enlarge Straight Outta Compton Straight Outta Compton  Directed by F. Gary Gray The album that gives this musical biopic its name has been heralded as one of the most important in popular music. Straight Outta Compton (1988) by the Los Angeles rap outfit N.W.A. (""Niggaz Wit Attitudes"") thrust gangsta rap (or as characters in the film sometimes call it ""reality rap"") into the mainstream combining Dr. Dres funk-fused production style with some of the most violent enraged lyrics ever heard. The first three tracks ""Straight Outta Compton"" ""Fuck tha Police"" and ""Gangsta Gangsta"" became particularly notorious for their murderous allusions. Critics called the record thuggish unlistenable and unmusical. Fans said it spoke the truth. The album sold three million copies. Directed by F. Gary Gray (Be Cool) Straight Outta Compton revels in the groups controversy. When the members of N.W.A.--Dre Ice Cube Eazy-E DJ Yella and MC Ren--are arrested in Detroit for performing ""Fuck tha Police"" theyre thrown into the back of an armored van; after the doors shut the men bust up laughing with high-fives all around. At the preview screening I attended the crowd laughed too. This is a movie of mayhem mouth-offs and middle fingers. Yet N.W.A. is a complete group for only about half the movie--Ice Cube (admirably portrayed by the rappers son OShea Jackson Jr.) breaks away for a solo career in 1989 and just like the collective he left behind Straight Outta Compton deflates. The high stakes of the first act--including a much-noted letter of protest from an FBI public affairs officer to the groups record label--subside as Gray turns to the members solo careers and diss tracks against each other. Dres foray into label management with Death Row Records is good only for some forced Snoop Dogg and Tupac references. Eazy-Es struggles with N.W.A. manager Jerry Heller make for some of the best one-on-one scenes--Jason Mitchell is excellent as E Paul Giamatti serviceably skunky as Heller--but their moments are fatty. There are hints of a better film here. Matthew Libatiques camera hustles through the streets with purpose and the Compton-centric scenes--a raid on a crack house a sweep through the Rodney King riots--have a documentary-like feel. Screenwriters Jonathan Herman and Andrea Berloff flirt with the idea of critiquing N.W.A.s polarizing influence on society but they divide the men too soon to touch on anything meaningful. They might have foregrounded the albums still-relevant theme of class injustice but despite an electric beginning they veer away into low-risk interpersonal drama. This movie about a group of risk-takers should have taken more risks itself. v Trailer More Movie Review >> Tags Movie Review Straight Outta Compton F. Gary Gray N.W.A.

It succeeds on a visceral level. 159 Shares Share 93 Tweet 61 Share 5 Share Email Print Share Photo Jaimie Trueblood/Universal Pictures The story of pioneering L.A. gangsta rappers N.W.A. (as dictated and co-produced by the now-bazillionaire N.W.A.ers themselves) Straight Outta Compton is among the most potent rags-to-riches showbiz movies ever made. Its not the music itself that puts the film over although hard-core bangers like ""Fuck tha Police"" still trigger both your exultation and fight-or-flight response. Its the density of detail -- along with jagged hand-held camerawork that evokes a war zone -- that renders the trauma universal. Its how the movie makes you see the world through the eyes of Andre Young (a.k.a. Dr. Dre) OShea Jackson (a.k.a. Ice Cube) and Eazy-E (Eric Wright); and so the meaning the urgency at times the necessity of even the most obscene vainglorious and incendiary rhymes emerge with thrilling clarity. I know millions of people didnt need a biopic to understand that urgency -- or need for that matter my white-mansplainin of the roots of gangsta rap. But Straight Outta Compton aims to cross cultures and sanctify the wisdom of the street -- to make a universal underdog story. It succeeds on a visceral level. Directed by F. Gary Gray from a shapely often subtle script by Jonathan Herman and Andrea Berloff the film depicts a world thats a series of confrontations one swiftly following the next. The cops manhandle and go nose-to-nose with young black men their attacks a test of manhood to be met with casual defiance with heads held high. But damage is also done by other black men who put their own pride on the line in dances of dominance and submission. A Nearly every scene centers on intense negotiations for power and dignity. The film opens with a sequence in which dope dealer Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell) challenges a bigger better-armed group of other dealers -- until the LAPD rolls a tank through the side of the house. (I thought the cops saved the young fools life actually.) Dre (Corey Hawkins) makes the mistake of razzing a Crenshaw Mafia soldier from a bus and gets a pistol cocked in his face. Ice Cube (OShea Jackson Jr.) -- who supplies all the rhymes -- bristles from the start at being shortchanged. But the chests of these three men -- plus DJ Yella (Neil Brown Jr.) and MC Ren (Aldis Hodge) -- visibly swell when their music starts coming. Their wariness and jitters are transmuted; by proclaiming their power they become powerful. This is not art for arts sake though. At the first whiff of a breakthrough they say ""Lets go get this money."" The conspicuous consumption and scores of unclothed women are not a by-product of the groups celebrity. Theyre the point of it. Theyre something more to flaunt onstage. In some ways making money and boasting about it is their art. Much of Straight Outta Compton turns on N.W.A.s relatively swift dissolution here blamed squarely on their manager Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti) whose strategy is divide and conquer. Despite his reassurances (""Everybody knows how important you are Ice Cube"" says Giamatti in his basso purr) he favors Eazy -- who promptly sells out the more talented Dre and Cube. But for much of the film writers Herman and Berloff (along with Giamatti) resist making Heller an easy villain. Hes part guardian angel. He gets their music instantly. He pitches them fervently. He stands up to brutal abusive cops (You n-----s supposed to be somewhere?"") outside the recording studio in Torrance California -- among them a black officer who cant conceive of rap being ""art."" He treats Eazy with genuine tenderness. In other scenes though Giamatti telegraphs Hellers duplicity his eyes signaling his lies. The portrait has been vigorously disputed by the real Heller but as Amos Barshad reminds us in a Grantland Heller interview ""History is written by the winners."" The loser of N.W.A. was of course Eazy and as magnetic as Hawkinss and Jacksons performances are its Mitchells who comes to dominate the film. Everything that makes his Eazy difficult to like in the first two thirds make him impossible not to pity in the last. It was Eazys desperate need for respect that made him ripe for Hellers machinations and when his fortunes collapse he has nothing to fall back on -- no resources no discipline and truth to tell not as much talent as the bullying Cube and the virtuosic Dre. Hes a character of tragic proportions. With so many players calling the creative shots the screenwriters cant fully flesh out the connection between the characters oppression by society and their subsequent oppression of others -- a theme of such magnificent dramas as August Wilsons Ma Raineys Black Bottom. The movies Dre has been stripped of a dark side. Theres no hint of the accusations against him of repeated physical abuse and the film suggests that he was too naive to understand the true malignancy of his next manager Suge Knight (the incredibly credible R. Marcos Taylor) until Knight became positively Caligula-like. Ice Cubes defense of the groups misogyny in the latest Rolling Stone (""If youre a bitch youre probably not going to like us. If youre a ho you probably dont like us ... I never understood why an upstanding lady would even think were talking about her"") has no onscreen correlative.A A But I wouldnt call Straight Outta Compton a whitewash. Theres no way to soften this music and the soundtrack -- a brilliantly seamless mix of new (actors) and classic performances -- keeps the movie in the present tense. So do recent street scenes eerily reminiscent of the late 80s under LAPD chief Daryl Gates. (The film gives us another look at the beating of Rodney King -- along with the legal exoneration of the officers who beat him.) One of the high points of the movie is in Detroit where a particularly saturnine police chief orders N.W.A. not to play ""Fuck tha Police"" or theyll be hauled off to jail. The band of course makes the song the concerts thunderous set piece. What happens next though is superbly double-edged pandemonium brutal suppression of free speech band members seized and thrown into the back of a van. But as the audience is shaking with rage the members of N.W.A. burst into celebratory laughter. They know the near-riot will be all over the news. They know theres gold in that suppression.

"Age of Compton N.W.A With Artificial Sweeteners << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Age of Compton N.W.A With Artificial Sweeteners Universal Pictures Movies August 14 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print How helpful of Straight Outta Compton to let us know where in South Los Angeles we are and in which year and the names of the various characters. We see a guy chilling prone on a carpet of LPs wearing a set of headphones and some type lets us know that this is Andre Young also known as Dr. Dre. And that little dude with the juicy Jheri curl who just barged into a dealers drug den looking to get paid? Thats Eric Wright who goes by Eazy-E. When their five-man rap outfit N.W.A defies law enforcements pre-concert demand that ""Fuck tha Police"" go unperformed were told were in Detroit. The exposition shows up for other things too. For instance I at least was happy to know that the poolside bouncing and jiggling we see at some point is at ""Eazy-Es Wet N Wild Party"" and not some other thing at say Bobby Browns house. Then theres the melee at ""The New Music Seminar"" between former N.W.A lyricist and snarler-in-chief Ice Cube and the groups loyalists. The tags are as selective as the films memory of events. Theres one that reads ""Death Row Records 1991"" yet given the robustly compromised corniness afflicting this movie none for such unavoidable Los Angeles-movie enclaves as East Cliche and West Gollywood. More Straight Outta Compton Jerry Heller Expresses Himself Dr. Dres Compton Is Bold Busy and Unexpectedly Radical On the one hand the movies mere existence constitutes some kind of cultural triumph. It once seemed impossible to imagine a Hollywood film about a group that called itself Niggaz With Attitude. That attitude was absorbed by American culture until it emanated from the center; until the perception of rappers evolved from terrors and trouble-makers (for the FBI in N.W.As case) to chic accessories and rap became something like a pop food group. What was nationally terrifying about N.W.A in the late 1980s and early 1990s hasnt become safe per se but thanks to the lubricants of capitalism its certainly palatable and profitable. Dr. Dre was once infamous for such incidents as a physical attack on the rapper and radio host Dee Barnes after she conducted an interview with Ice Cube. Now hes the impresario who brought you Eminem and a brand of ubiquitous fashion headphones and who recently struck a traffic-stoppingly lucrative deal with Apple. (Dre has called himself the first billionaire in hip-hop.) Meanwhile Ice Cube went from eclectically produced works of panoramic militancy and kaleidoscopic intolerance (AmeriKKKas Most Wanted Death Certificate and The Predator are the classics) to PG-rated family movies and enough cop and detective roles to staff a sitcom precinct. That kind of topsy-turvy irony-laden cultural shift makes it possible for a movie like Straight Outta Compton to observe the group through the retrospective lens of success as opposed to reckoning with what it and its peers represented back then to white America insurrection. We know the story ends with a ka-ching. The director is F. Gary Gray who made videos for Dr. Dre including ""Keep Their Heads Ringin"" and directed Ice Cube 20 years ago in Friday which Straight Outta Compton takes unnatural pains to identify him writing. Hes also listed as a coproducer with Dr. Dre Ice Cube and Eazy-Es widow Tomica Woods-Wright. This is to say theres no classified information here. Straight Outta Compton is so beholden to the appeasement of so many artists and legacies and estates that none of it coheres as a movie. Theres no point of view -- just the masculinized version of the generically entertaining bitchery you find on nighttime soaps. But should the story of five gangsta-rappers from Compton feel this much like Melrose Place? For almost two and a half hours the movie details -- with the finesse of a paint roller -- blowups the making of solo records reconciliations and medical demise. (If we didnt know that Eazy-E died of AIDS in 1995 the characters coughing jags in the second half are our warning.) Universal Pictures The film opens in 1986 with the whirr of a low-flying helicopter which is the MGM lion roar of gangsta films. Theres a night raid of a Compton home featuring a battering ram and dozens of agents in military gear that makes you understand the need for place markers -- lest you think we were in Fallujah. Otherwise the early scenes are loose and playful. The group comes together in and around the nightclub where Dr. Dre (played by Corey Hawkins) and Antoine Carraby a.k.a. DJ Yella (Neil Brown Jr.) spin records in flammable-looking chauffeur costumes. The clubs manager Alonzo Williams (Corey Reynolds) just wants them to play mid-tempo baby-making hits. But one night Dre puts on Steve Arringtons drop-everything-and-dance club jam ""Weak at the Knees"" and Ice Cube (OShea Jackson Jr. playing his father) gets up and barks freestyle over the top of it winding up with the phrase ""I dont give a fuck"" which would serve as the groups go-to license to assault. They decide to form a group bankrolled by money from Eazys drug business. They audition rappers but when the tryouts dont like Ice Cubes lyrics the group members wind up doing the rapping themselves. (Aldis Hodge plays MC Ren ne Lorenzo Patterson the fifth original member of the group and even more of a nonentity here than DJ Yella.) Singles are pressed and distributed request lines burn up. And one day rather quickly a business manager introduces himself at the pressing plant promising that HE knows the right people to make them a success. His names Jerry Heller and hes got an ashy complexion an endless supply of sweatsuits and the full investment of Paul Giamattis bulldog acting.1 Heller gets the group signed to Priority Records which releases Straight Outta Compton. Fame notoriety and squabbling ensue. Why for instance isnt Ice Cube being paid as he should? And whys Eazy the only member with a contract? The breakdown of the group produces the occasional LOL moment like when Ice Cubes wife Kimberly Woodruff (Alexandra Shipp) hears that Eazy called her husband ""Benedict Arnold"" on N.W.As ""Message to B.A."" and asks ""Is he trying to call you a traitor?"" Which is almost like having a female character in a football movie inquire as to what a touchdown is. Bad business becomes the narrative engine but most of the good scenes are set in recording studios Dre directing Eazy to nasally stardom for the opening line of ""Boyz-n-the Hood""; the sequence in which Ice Cubes recording ""No Vaseline"" as his old groupmates and Heller react in horror to hearing it for the first time. That song is still shocking not just for the rawness of its homophobia but also for the totality of its attack. Lots of rappers were violent but Ice Cube had the voice of a man who understood the deadliness of his lyrics. The group spent its apex in part defending its First Amendment rights. But at his most dangerous Ice Cube seemed protected by the second.  Universal Pictures That ""No Vaseline"" scene reintroduces Ice Cubes ingenious bellicosity. It also suggests that his son could be a star. Based only on this movie hes a more supple emotionally transparent actor than his father. Theres no trace of his dads humorlessness. Theres a hotel-sex-party scene that embodies the misogyny on N.W.As first album and lets Jackson who pushes a half-naked woman out of the room into the hallway have the line of the night ""Bye Felicia"" Its outrageously mean but so perfectly done that the audience applauds. And Jacksons energy cuts the flippant cruelty of that scene. His is the only performance other than Giamattis thats allowed to breathe. Who knows what else Jackson can do? Who knows what else hell be allowed to do? Hollywood is overpopulated with underemployed young black actors but Jackson deserves more work and in smarter movies. This is as muddled as a movie thats been produced -- but neither written nor directed -- by representatives of discrete if not outright competitive sides can be. Dre and Ice Cube have ensured that their legacies are telegraphed as early and often as possible and that Eazy-E has the warmth of a slanket. His is the gauziest reappraisal. The character goes from the sort of thug who screeches lines like ""Bitch I just told you Im not thirsty"" to the guy with a warm filial relationship with Heller where Eazys savvy sensitivity and intelligence flourish. Their professional bond also makes the other men in the group uncomfortable -- Eazys heterosexual promiscuity comes up in throwaway lines but its his love for and trust in Heller that gives the film what little emotional center it has. Straight Outta Compton discards that -- and with it Heller who goes under the bus trapped justly or not in a crooked-manager plot. Here its Mrs. Eazy who goes over the books and tries to wake her husband up. You probably couldnt have broken one rapper out from this story and given him an arc without the others crying foul. But each of these men has undergone an evolution that one movie cant do much with. (DJ Yella for example made a killing in the adult-film world.) So what youve got is a bunch of strolling contradictions. Its not an oral history youre getting with Straight Outta Compton just the smushy boilerplate that happens anytime screenwriters (here its Jonathan Herman and Andrea Berloff) get near musicians. This is Behind the Music stuff that never goes far enough behind. There are cameos by someone pretending to be Tupac and by Keith Stanfield whos pretty great in his couple of scenes as Snoop Dogg. But by this point youre no longer in a film; youre on a Wikipedia page conveyor belt. In fairness were I telling a story that involved Suge Knight (R. Marcos Taylor) -- record executive Dres ex-business partner and convicted criminal -- Id be a fool not to do something with him. But this movie leans so desperately on Knights purported evil that it even keeps him clad in satanic red. Every scene in his presence reroutes the movie toward psycho-thriller camp. This seems ludicrous for a film about young black men being released at this moment a year after a summer where poor police-community relations roiled the country again. But Straight Outta Compton demonstrates a merely flirtatious awareness of the reality of whats happening now. Its strongest scenes -- the ones in which Grays characteristic muscularity and cinematographer Matthew Libatiques usual richness come off their leashes -- involve the tension between the black community and law enforcement. The movie has pungent encounters with the Los Angeles Police Department first when officers assault members of the group (""Im the original gangster up in here"" one white officer more or less says before he throws Ice Cube on the hood of a car) and later when an absurd run-in precedes a car chase involving Dre. Theres another scene in Detroit between the group and the dozens of officers whove come out to demand that the group omit their anti-cop hit from their show. They do the song and are arrested leaving behind a riot notable for the number of young white hands banging on the police van as it speeds off with the group. Raps decade-long drift to the center was almost complete. But the most distressing LAPD run-in happens during a recording session in beachy Torrance a city just south and west of Compton with scarcely a black resident. The guys have broken for lunch when a handful of cops descend upon them. The suddenness of the takedown is clumsily staged but Gray maintains his composure and the boldness sticks with you. The presiding officer is black and speaks to Dre and Eazy and the gang with the hateful disregard typically used in the movies by white officers. The power of the encounter comes at you from all sides. Hellers outrage feels like disillusionment. He really cant understand whats happening. He sees his partners stomach-down on the pavement and it hurts him. He tells the officer that these young men are artists -- rappers -- to which the cop replies that raps not an art. Its the exact opposite racial position in which Giamatti found himself in 12 Years a Slave where the trader he played acquired and sold black bodies with cold-blooded hauteur. Here hes seething over their mistreatment and its the rare example the movies have in which white peoples speaking on behalf of black people rocks you -- because when these black men try to speak for themselves no ones listening. You know what ""eureka"" songwriting moment that confrontation will produce and you cant wait to see it happen. You crave the anger and defiance of that song. Perhaps its that bloodlust for simple musical justice that keeps most of the rest of this movie so light so detached from what still happens in this country. The filmmakers want to be ""responsible"" or ""positive"" or just wishfully forward-thinking. So please bring on Jimmy Iovine the music-business mogul and Dres work partner whose progressiveness is presented as the antidote to the Jerry Hellers and Suge Knights of the world. Lets have Dre meet Iovine at the same unnamed pool party where he meets his future and forever wife Nicole. In the end Straight Outta Compton seems almost terrified of the power it has of the history its fooling around with. Rick Famuyiwas drug farce from June Dope was another movie set in and out of the South Los Angeles underclass (Inglewood) that seemed afraid of the incendiary potential of its material. Both movies are peddling a perfume rather than the reality of their respective locales. They imply the alternative narratives that exist in say Charles Burnetts Killer of Sheep from 1978 but its way more viable to reconsecrate what we assume to be true about these neighborhoods and who lives there. Straight Outta Compton stresses the exit the ""outta"" as all optimistic hood movies try to. In doing so this movie neutralizes the power of what made it possible for N.W.A to leave. Worst it all but forsakes the brief but inexorable moment when these five black males were the most riveting men in popular culture hailing from one of the countrys epicenters of racial dismay. The movie tosses into the dramatic mix stock news footage depicting Comptons danger and socioeconomic sink. On the news poor black neighborhoods -- The Ghetto -- were nightmares white people were trained to fear as were the black people who lived there. N.W.A blasted out of the nightmare amplifying the threat. The music on that first album was crude and non-ideological (Dres production gave it artistic depth). The songs made no greater demands than for the nations attention. They werent coming for you. They were already here.  Universal Pictures Where the intended audience saw scary black boys I saw bullies high school slur-slinging tray-slapping wedging-giving bullies. It was almost scientific. I didnt like N.W.A because N.W.A didnt like me. The word ""straight"" sounded like a defensive threat. But there was an immediate empowerment in the flagrance of some of those songs. Whatever people heard in the Sex Pistols that sent them either ducking for cover or to the guitar shop is what happened in my world with N.W.A. No one had heard anything like this before. The Last Poets werent this blunt. Neither was Gil Scott-Heron. The first time I said ""fuck"" ""the"" and ""police"" I whispered them into a locker and it was like sticking a fork into a wall socket. N.W.A didnt invent ""scary"" as the black-male trope. They perfected it. The album Straight Outta Compton was released the same year that Orion Pictures released Colors a movie made by well-meaning macho white liberals that wants so badly to be about the scourge of bad policing but turns the black and Latino gangs into subservient morons and the crooked young nutso cop into a hero. N.W.A seemed to spring from an allergic reaction to depictions like that. They arrived at a moment during the 1980s and early 1990s in which strange and scary black men seemed to be everywhere -- in the scandalous misunderstood photography of Robert Mapplethorpe as the men railroaded to plead guilty for a gang rape in Central Park and as crooks in almost every crime show on television. N.W.A seemed to reappropriate and harness all of that supposed guilt and rub it in Americas face. Their scariness was certainly opportunistic. Theyd take societal menace as far as it could go. In the film that arrest in Detroit inspires dollar signs. But in those police-confrontation scenes you can see where the rage comes from. Thats real. Being fearsome was probably the only innate power otherwise available to a powerless kid from South Los Angeles. No one wants to hear that since it confirms the worst realities about who were not supposed to be as a country. There are clips of the Rodney King beating in 1991 and a brief re-staging of the ensuing riots and uprisings. But Straight Outta Compton doesnt want to psychologize. It seems terrified to more directly connect that music to both its human and societal sources. Its easier to make the hip-hop Avengers. Something that group did struck a raw nerve. But now everybody responsible for that moment seems content to remind us that they also struck it rich. Between this and his work in Love amp; Mercy as nasty Eugene Landy the shrink who manipulated Brian Wilson and his purse strings Giamatti is having quite a year as despicable iconic (alleged) weasels.

By John Swansburg From left to right Aldis Hodge Neil Brown Jr. Jason Mitchell OShea Jackson Jr. and Corey Hawkins in Straight Outta Compton. Photo by Universal Pictures The opening track on Eazy-Es 1988 LP Eazy-Duz-It begins with a spooky baritone voice offering an unexpected challenge to the well-meaning soul who has just placed the cassette tape in his boombox. ""Now that you got the album"" the voice intones ""what the fuck are you going to do with it bitch?"" (The emphasis is very much in the original.) John Swansburg John Swansburg is Slates deputy editor. Its a strange way to welcome listeners especially to a debut album. But Eazy-E was never one for pleasantries and its always struck me as the perfect introduction to the diminutive hustler-turned-rapper. This is an artist who in his first hit ""Boyz-n-the-Hood"" described murdering an old friend with a 12-gauge shotgun for trying to steal an Alpine speaker out of his car. Eazys music was an outrageous provocation and an irresistible one. What are you going to do with the album? If you were like me you kept listening to it because youd never ever heard anything like it. Advertisement The origins of this no-holds-barred style of rap is the subject of Straight Outta Compton which recounts the rise of Eazy and his compatriots Ice Cube and Dr. Dre. On the strength of ""Boyz-n-the-Hood""--which Ice Cube wrote and Dre produced--the three would go on to form the supergroup NWA. Their first album also called Straight Outta Compton touched off a revolution that put West Coast hip-hop on the map and in a very specific corner of it the blighted bungalows of Compton California. The film is produced by Dre and Cube (along with Eazys widow Tomica Woods-Wright among others) and even fans of those two might justifiably worry that theyre in for little more than legend-burnishing from a pair of aging stars eager to relive their halcyon days as gun-toting eight-ball-swilling rebels. Both men have long since settled into a very comfortable middle age. Ice Cube is now a pitchman for Coors Light and an able player of the put-upon dad in childrens entertainment. Dre while still a rap impresario is as well-known today for his lucrative foray into the headphone business as for his work on a mixing board. Straight Outta Compton is undoubtedly a nostalgia trip but its one you take in a 64 Impala with height-adjustable suspension. Straight Outta Compton is undoubtedly a nostalgia trip but this being NWA its one you take in a 64 Impala with height-adjustable suspension. Its a loud stylish ride one that rewards but does not require a working memory of the shock that accompanied NWAs arrival on the hip-hop scene. And while no one will mistake this for a protest film--there are too many pool parties--the movies portrait of a militarized police force all too eager to assault young black men cant help but resonate in our own moment. The hard truths of NWAs reportage (""police think they have the authority/ to kill a minority"" Ice Cube rapped on ""Fuck tha Police"") and the unbridled anger that fueled the groups work sadly feel no less pertinent in the era of Michael Brown as in that of Rodney King. NWA mixed a brew of hedonism nihilism and misogyny (""life aint nothing but bitches and money"" in the groups pithy summation) that could have been toxic but it worked in part due to the charisma of the rappers who breathed an infectious anarchic spirit into the music. ""We dont Just Say No"" Ice Cube barked on ""Gangsta Gangsta"" in a retort to the Reagan-era War on Drugs. ""Were too busy saying yeeaah"" Its a tall order to channel that kind of magnetism but the lead actors in Straight Outta Compton are more than up to the task evoking the young rappers to an almost disconcerting degree. Advertisement In the case of Ice Cube this is a function of genetics as much as casting--hes played by OShea Jackson Jr. his own son though even by the standards of Mendelian inheritance the resemblance to the teenage Cube is uncanny. Its not just that he looks the part however--hes mastered his fathers ability to shift from simmering intensity to sly playfulness and back with little more than the curl of a lip. The relatively unknown Corey Hawkins gives emotional dimension to Dre the most laconic of the trio showing a more vulnerable side of the hard-nosed golden-eared producer. Most impressive of all is fellow newcomer Jason Mitchell whose Eazy-E is a frightening coil of bravado and insecurity the Napoleon of Crenshaw Boulevard. Director F. Gary Gray is probably best known for his work on Friday the stoner hip-hop classic but he may have gathered more pertinent experience for this film on the set of his zippy 2003 remake of The Italian Job. Half the fun of a heist film comes in the assembling of the crack team that will pull off the caper and thats certainly the case here. When the movie opens Dre is marooned spinning records at a club that wont let him play hardcore hip-hop Cube is writing rhymes on the bus home from a school in the suburbs where the kids listen to Tears for Fears and Eazy is dodging well-armed drug dealers and LAPD batterrams. We know how potent these talents and histories will be when they finally link up and its a thrill watching it slowly dawn on them too. Capturing the creative process on film is always difficult but Gray chooses his moments wisely. An early scene in which Eazy is coaxed into the recording booth by Dre (he had originally intended to be a silent partner; ""Im the Berry Gordy of this shit"" he protests) is especially effective by turns funny and exhilarating. Forcing him to take and retake a single line--Cruising down the street in my six-four--Dre molds the reluctant Eric Wright into the swaggering Eazy-E right before our eyes. Eazy is the fast-beating heart and tortured soul of the movie. Straight Outta Compton the full-length album they ultimately record together (along with lesser lights DJ Yella and MC Ren) represents an inflection point in the history of rap. But unlike another seminal 1988 hip-hop album Public Enemys It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back Straight Outta Compton is far from a wire-to-wire masterpiece. Its outsized influence stems largely from just its first three songs The agenda-setting title track the incendiary ""Fuck tha Police"" and ""Gangsta Gangsta"" which gave a name to the groups sound gangsta rap. Grays film peaks early too in its account of the groups formation and swift rise to prominence and notoriety. Once the album has caught fire and NWA is selling out shows across the country the film loses some of its momentum. Its at this point that the drama shifts from the artists rebellion against their bleak circumstances and an unsympathetic music industry to the less engaging in-fighting that inevitably attends a bands stratospheric rise. The dissolution of NWA over contract disputes with their manager Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti lightly noshing the scenery) lacks the appeal of their rags-to-riches origin story though there are occasional highlights. Most notable is the sequence in which Gray cleverly intercuts Ice Cubes recording of the vicious diss track ""No Vaseline"" with a scene of the remaining members of NWA wincing as they listen to their erstwhile bandmate turn the ire he once reserved for the men in blue back on them. Top Comment Now the ""A"" stands for arthritis.....  More... -A loner a rebel Join In Another flaw is more serious. It may sound obtuse to chastise this biopic for misogyny when its subjects are notorious for their poor treatment of women both in their lyrics and in some cases outside them. But its not too much to ask that the 2015 film refrain from falling prey to the retrograde attitudes of the 1988 album. One scene that might have been an occasion to take a hard look at the groups troubling treatment of the female sex--a raucous tour party that nearly turns violent--is ultimately played for cruel laughs. Elsewhere women are little more than props parading around the pool wearing (in the phrase of one of NWAs less hard-edged contemporaries) less than bikinis. Once the group is finally dissolved the film plods to its conclusion dutifully chronicling the remaining biographical milestones of its stars Dres discovery of Snoop Dogg Ice Cubes flirtation with the Nation of Islam the deterioration of Eazys health (dramatized unsubtly by a series of uh-oh coughing fits that may at first suggest to NWA neophytes that the rapper died of consumption not complications from AIDS). Its only after Eazys death that it becomes clear how essential hes been to the action up to that point. Though he never enjoyed the post-NWA success of Dre or Cube and wasnt around to ensure that this film would cast him in a sympathetic light Eazy is the fast-beating heart and tortured soul of the movie. Thats either Dre and Cubes tribute to the fallen comrade who put up the money for that first recording session which started it all or a tribute to the irrepressibleness of the man who didnt think he could rap then made it look easy.

Photo Credit Universal Pictures / Jaimie Trueblood advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The rise and fall of the controversial rap group N.W.A. Rated R (language violence sexuality). BOTTOM LINE A riveting film about the birth of not just one rap group but an entire genre. CAST OShea Jackson Jr. Jason Mitchell Corey Hawkins Paul Giamatti LENGTH 227 ""Straight Outta Compton"" the 1988 debut album by N.W.A. not only gave birth to gangsta rap but sparked a nationwide case of hand-wringing. The music became the center of a debate Was a song like ""Gangsta Gangsta"" a reflection of reality or just a violent fantasy marketed to at-risk youth? Either way N.W.A. forced white America to have a conversation about racism poverty and crime. Most listeners agreed on only one thing Man those beats were dope. F. Gary Grays riveting biographical film about N.W.A. which shares its title with that landmark album feels surprisingly urgent for a movie set roughly 25 years ago. It argues that whatever ugliness we heard in N.W.A.s music hasnt gone away. It also implicitly draws a straight line from the police harassment that inspired the bands most incendiary track ""[expletive] tha Police"" to the recent killings of black men by cops in Ferguson Cincinnati and elsewhere. Set to N.W.A.s pugnacious rap tracks and crackling with the energy of a charismatic young cast ""Straight Outta Compton"" is the rare biopic that resonates beyond the music. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Who was the Sons of Anarchy Homeless Woman? Among its main attractions are a dazzling OShea Jackson Jr. playing his father Ice Cube and newcomer Jason Mitchell as the insouciant Eazy-E both founding members of N.W.A. along with MC Ren (Aldis Hodge) DJ Yella (Neil Brown Jr.) and future super-producer Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins). Gray who has directed music videos for Ice Cube and Dr. Dre (both producers of this film) paints Compton as an inner-city minefield of gangs drug dealers and cops that informed the bands hard-boiled sensibility. Paul Giamatti is terrific as Jerry Heller the faded but still-savvy manager who helped turn N.W.A. into a double-platinum-selling sensation. In keeping with rap tradition ""Straight Outta Compton"" can be self-aggrandizing vengeful (rival rap mogul Suge Knight played by R. Marcus Taylor comes off as Satan incarnate) and more than a little misogynistic (the women here are mostly groupies). Still the movie deserves credit for its sensitive treatment of Eazy-E whose 1995 death from AIDS served as a wake-up call to the hip-hop community. In the end ""Straight Outta Compton"" feels as relevant and necessary as the music at its center. 226 MoviesStraight Outta Compton trailer ----- advertisement | advertise on newsday FOUR MORE STORIES OF RAP AND HIP-HOP ARTISTS Though the lives of musical performers have provided material for screenwriters since movies learned to talk ""Straight Outta Compton"" is one of the few films to focus on hip-hoppers in this case the group N.W.A. Here are some others that were inspired by the true stories of rap and hip-hop artists. 8 MILE (2002) -- Though star Eminem didnt want this film about an aspiring rapper nicknamed ""B-Rabbit"" to be autobiographical the movie borrowed many details from his life from its bleak Detroit setting to the strained relationship between B-Rabbit and his mom (Kim Basinger).GET RICH OR DIE TRYIN (2005) -- Star Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jacksons life served as the backbone of this story about an inner-city youth who turns to crime and drug dealing after his mother is murdered. He finds redemption in rap and hip-hop.ATL (2006) -- Musician-record exec Dallas Austin and Tionne ""T-Boz"" Watkins of the group TLC produced this movie based on their experiences growing up in Atlanta where personal dramas and hip-hop played out at the local roller-skating rink.NOTORIOUS (2009) -- Not to be confused with the Alfred Hitchcock thriller of the same name this biopic was a no-holds-barred retelling of the life and murder at age 24 of rapper Notorious B.I.G. (played by Jamal Woolard). --Daniel Bubbeo Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

Gary Gray Written by Jonathan Herman Andrea Berloff Starring OShea Jackson Jr. Corey Hawkins Jason Mitchell Paul Giamatti Country USA Language English The new N.W.A. biopic plays like a superhero origin story. In its precredits prologue small-time hustler Eric (Eazy-E) Wright (Jason Mitchell in a breakout role) lithely slips out of a drug house under siege by the police armed with battering ram and all. Busting through the glass of a back window narrowly evading the snatch of a snarling dogs jaws as he scales a chain-link fence then skittering across Compton rooftops to relative safety Eazy looks like a streetwise Spider-Man. ""Straight Outta Compton"" traces the rise of Ice Cube and Dr. Dre in the 80s rap group N.W.A.

CP Video Video Video New Movies Straight Outta Compton tells story of N.W.A The fourth film in the Mad Max franchise starring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron lands in theatres on May 15. Movie Preview Summer movie preview From Fantastic Four to Poltergeist 19 flicks coming your way Elsewhere the daydreaming Andre (Dr. Dre) Young (Corey Hawkins) is lying on the floor of his moms house arranged in a fanned-out pile of records in a way that people always seem to be when they listen to records in movies. Across town superserious would-be street poet OShea (Ice Cube) Jackson (OShea Jackson Jr. the real Ice Cubes actual son looking every inch the part) scrawls lyrics into one of those two-tone Mead notebooks people always scrawl things into in movies. Also MC Ren (Aldis Hodge) and DJ Yella (Neil Brown Jr.) are there. Differently frustrated with the dreariness tedium and limited prospects of their no- to low-income neighbourhood these five urban Avengers form N.W.A. - Niggaz Wit Attitudes.With their powers combined and under the tutelage of manager Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti) N.W.A. launched the careers of its banner stars and reinvented rap music. Their breakout 1988 debut studio album also called Straight Outta Compton was certified double-platinum praised by Sinead OConnor and popularized the controversial genre of ""gangsta rap."" N.W.A.s lyrics - ""reality rap"" its often called in Straight Outta Compton though Id never in my life heard this term before seeing the movie - detailed the travails of black life in America in a way that still seems scarily pathetically relevant circa 2015.Scenes of the group being hassled by cops for doing nothing other than standing on a street looking the part of a ""gangbanger"" swell with a breathless tension. Watching it I was reminded of the Popes much-publicized endorsement of Mel Gibsons hyper-violent messiah movie The Passion of the Christ ""It is as it was."" But this movie demands a revision of John Paul IIs pith. Straight Outta Compton isnt as it was. It is as it is.The topical quality buzzing through Straight Outta Compton comes as a relief. In recent years Ice Cube has slumped into a family-friendly camera mugger parodying the flinty hardness he used to rap about so convincingly (though hes very funny in the Jump Street movies). Meanwhile Dr. Dre is now best known as an impresario selling overpriced headphones that make their wearer look like Elroy Jetson. Even Dres long-gestating final album - Compton nee Detox which was snap-released last week - felt a bit like a calculated tie-in to the biopic about himself that he co-produced. Add to this the early images from early trailers of Giamatti waddling around in a jumpsuit and some wariness about Straight Outta Compton was more than warranted.Would it turn out a piece of potent politicized art like the music it chronicles? Or would it be little more than a long-form infomercial for Beats by Dre headphones? Well to its credit its both.The trick the movie pulls off is the same its namesake album achieved nearly 30 years ago. Straight Outta Compton functions as both a compelling damnably topical political statement and a slickly produced piece of commercial art. Director F. Gary Gray (who also made the seminal 1995 Ice Cube comedy Friday) shoots the streets of Compton and post-Rodney-King-verdict riots with searing believability the concert scenes with energy to spare and the exhilarating escapes and beatdowns with action-movie adrenalin.Straight Outta Compton is also beholden to plenty of biopic cliches. The middle section of Dre Ice Cube Eazy et al. raking in money has everything short of a Scarface-style montage scored to the rat-a-tat rhythm of a cash counting machine. Likewise the movies de facto enemies - Heller and R. Marcus Taylor as Death Row Records co-founder Suge Knight - are almost comically one-dimensional. Giamatti plays Heller as the conniving pitiable quintessence of the Jewish music manager as Shylockian extortionist. And Taylors Knight feels like a baddie plucked out of an old blaxploitation B-movie down to the garish suits and cigar-chomping smirk. Such cartoonish supervillainy is all the better for a superhero movie I suppose.The movie doesnt bother digging much into any N.W.A. offences that cant be excused by depicting them as hardened defenders of the First Amendment. Dre violently beating reporter Dee Barnes is unsurprisingly not figured in the film. And the allegations of homophobia/anti-Semitism/misogyny levelled against the group are briskly brushed aside. Such knowing lapses are of course predictable for a movie thats pulling double-duty as an ad for N.W.A.s legacy.Nonetheless this glossy commercial bent serves the material which is ultimately a story of outsiders carving out their own space in the larger world of pop culture and commerce. Besides the movies weight in our contemporary post-Ferguson historical moment Straight Outta Compton may also be the funniest most exhilarating and flat-out best Hollywood movie of the summer.

I certainly remember that gangsta-rap supergroup N.W.As 1988 debut album ""Straight Outta Compton"" was greeted with a mixture of outrage and consternation by those forces in society who always fail to recognize that they have cast themselves in the roles of prim schoolmarm and/or hypocritical preacher. (Either they pretend not to remember that the same thing happened with Elvis with comic books with horror movies with heavy metal and punk rock and video games or they soberly assure us that this case is very different.) But I had forgotten that N.W.As first national tour was greeted with riled-up demonstrators who bought piles of ""Straight Outta Compton"" LPs and CDs simply in order to crush them with bulldozers.In director F. Gary Grays crowd-pleasing new N.W.A biopic also called ""Straight Outta Compton"" group co-founders Dr. Dre (played by Corey Hawkins) and Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell) look out a tour-bus window at the angry crowd of record-crushers in bemusement. Those people bought the damn thing right? They can do what they want with it. That moment is no more than a comic footnote in Grays film a sprawling overstuffed formulaic but highly entertaining story of pop stardom and its discontents in which the pioneers of gangsta rap are burnished to a high mythological gloss. (Dr. Dre and Ice Cube surviving N.W.A founders turned showbiz zillionaires are among the movies producers so this should be viewed as the authorized and somewhat sanitized version of history.)But I think the symbolic violence of the record-crushers has a resonance that reaches both backward and forward in cultural history. Those people would never have heard of N.W.A or their obscure Los Angeles neighborhood if it hadnt been for one song on that album of course - and the way America reacted to that song eerily prefigured our current social and racial divisions over police violence and African-Americans. At the time N.W.A specifically rejected any activist role or perspective; gangsta rap was partly a reaction against the didactic ""conscious"" hip-hop of Public Enemy or Boogie Down Productions. At its most nihilistic gangsta rap had a lot in common with the ""no future"" ethos of early punk rock; N.W.A was closer to the Sex Pistols than the Clash and their music portrayed a world in which black lives didnt matter.All that looks a whole lot different with a quarter-centurys worth of hindsight and Grays film seeks to connect the historical dots somewhat while varnishing over the less savory details. As Stereo Williams of the Daily Beast has explored ""Straight Outta Compton"" never mentions Dr. Dres history of alleged violence against women or the pervasive misogyny of the gangsta genre. But lets get back to those white folks who wanted to destroy N.W.A so badly they gave them lots of free publicity and bonus record sales. That response (as well as being idiotic) reflects a deep-seated American anxiety about the corrosive social effects of pop music in general and black music in particular. At the time it clearly echoed a bizarre and revelatory event from less than a decade earlier the notorious Disco Demolition Night at Chicagos Comiskey Field in July of 1979. Lured by a local rock DJ who vowed to rid the world of the scourge of disco music - which to many whites of the 1970s was tainted both with blackness and gayness - nearly 50000 people showed up to watch him blow up a bin of dance records between games of a White Sox doubleheader. The crowd was virtually all white and heavily dosed with beer and weed and the result was essentially a riot Fans stormed the field climbed the foul poles tore up the bases and the pitching rubber and tried to invade the Sox owners private box. All to prove that disco sucked.At least Disco Demolition Night had an undeniable libidinal energy although the usual double standard of American life applied A drunken white mob engaged in pointless property destruction are high-spirited hell-raisers perhaps regrettable but essentially comic. Almost any group of black men outside an authorized context is perceived as inherently threatening. In ""Straight Outta Compton"" we see a fictionalized retelling of the episode that supposedly sparked ""Fuck tha Police"" N.W.As most controversial and influential song. While recording their album at a studio in Torrance a middle-class and mostly white community on L.A.s southern beachfront the groups members are harassed and humiliated by abusive local cops one of them an African-American who assures their white manager (played by Paul Giamatti) that rap isnt music and hes wasting his time with these gang-banger criminals. Whether or not it really happened that way that cop plays an important role in the film as the sole spokesman for the middle-class black communitys discomfort with gangsta rap. You Might Also Like That was the song of course that brought down the ire of the protesters with the plaid shorts the white sneakers and the rented bulldozers. ""Fuck tha Police"" was widely understood in mainstream white America not as an angry complaint or a cynical chronicle of street reality - or in structural terms as an outlet for youthful aggression closely akin to the Rolling Stones ""Street Fighting Man"" or the Sex Pistols ""God Save the Queen"" - but as an actual incitement to violence. Its amazing to look back and see the extent of the hysteria Five young men from an obscure Los Angeles suburb made a self-produced record for a small indie label which was almost entirely banned from radio play and attracted official warnings from the FBI and the Secret Service. Authorities in several cities refused to let them play and the movie depicts N.W.A driven from the stage and arrested by Detroit cops after defying an order not to play the Song That Shall Not Be Named. (Reality is a bit more prosaic Their show was shut down and the band members were questioned at their hotel but no one was arrested.)It wouldnt be fair to suggest that only whites were offended by that song or by the other sagas of dope deals promiscuity and casual violence written by Ice Cube and MC Ren the groups principal lyricists. Ever since rap music emerged in the late 70s it has been divisive within the African-American community and for many middle-class black people at the time the braggadocio misogyny and apparent celebration of criminality in gangsta rap seemed to embrace all the worst stereotypes about their community.None of that debate about rap within the black community directly surfaces in ""Straight Outta Compton"" which was scripted by Jonathan Herman and Andrea Berloff from an original story by Berloff S. Leigh Savidge and Alan Wenkus. For longtime hip-hop fans however the Dark Side of the Force is more than evident in R. Marcos Taylors terrifying performance as Suge Knight the brilliant entrepreneur who did so much to market hip-hop as a global generational brand and arguably did even more to destroy it. Knight is depicted here as a violent hothead surrounded by sinister companions and obsessed with humiliating his rivals but needless to say the most damaging rumors or allegations surrounding him go unmentioned. (In a case of life imitating art imitating life Knight currently faces murder charges for running over a music industry rival with his car - after an altercation on the set of this movie.) For those who launched a remarkably counterproductive campaign against N.W.A the problem wasnt simply that a rap group from L.A. had cut a record expressing dreadful disrespect for law enforcement. It was the disturbing and destabilizing effect that record had and exactly the same is true for those who stand with Darren Wilson or try to depict BlackLivesMatter protesters as hoodlums and anarchists. As we see in the movie (although it goes unmentioned) by the midpoint of N.W.As 1989 tour their audiences were often one-third to one-half white and sometimes more; almost 80 percent of sales of ""Straight Outta Compton"" came outside major cities.Exactly what kind of vicarious thrill or identification those white fans got from chanting along with ""Fuck tha Police"" is a complicated question much discussed by music critics and hip-hop scholars and not one this movie even tries to address. But that moment of cultural rebellion shifted the consciousness of young Americans in one direction and this moment of political direct action is doing the same in another. There are plenty of people who dont want the national consciousness shifted and indeed would like to unshift it as much as possible. Those people will fight back however they can and are unquestionably dangerous in the moment. History ultimately renders them pathetic. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Nor could it Director F. Gary Gray has too big a story to tell enough for a TV miniseries (or a seasons worth of ""Behind the Music"" episodes) and you can see him straining to cram everything in even as the film stretches to the two-and-a-half hour mark.This is a story of social upheaval beating the odds record business politics fame and fortune interpersonal drama and Suge Knight. Lots to cover. And the film takes a mostly straightforward approach cataloging the highs and lows of Dr. Dre Eazy E and Ice Cube (and to a far lesser extent MC Ren and DJ Yella).Sometimes ""Compton"" roars to life such as when Cube (played by Cubes real-life son OShea Jackson Jr.) is seen recording his seering diss track ""No Vaseline"" which is intercut with the rest of the group hearing and reacting to the song for the first time. The scenes dramatic license and shifts in time stand out in a film that too often plays for simple recreations of events we already know to be true.The approach is safe for a group that was anything but. Perhaps the involvement of Dre and Cube producers on the film led to the somewhat stodgy storytelling which aims for completeism but glosses over large chunks of the group members later years (and some of their more unflattering controversies). Meanwhile other questions go unanswered such as the motivations of manager Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti) who is warm toward Eazy E (Jason Mitchell) even while ripping him and the other group members blind.The cast is a mixed bag. Jacksons Cube and Mitchells Eazy are the best of the bunch the former nailing his fathers attitude and snarl and Mitchell capturing Eazys playful menace. Corey Hawkins Dr. Dre isnt as effective; Hawkins cant conjure the deep wells of soul behind Dres eyes or the business acumen that continues to make him one of hip-hops all-time most important figures.The screenplay by Jonathan Herman and Andrea Berloff starts off in the streets with a thrilling sequence where Eazy makes a daring escape from a stash house during a police raid. Soon hes in a recording studio and the scene where he finds his voice while laying down vocals for ""Boyz-n-the-Hood"" captures the spontaneous moments of creative inspiration that sometimes lead to immortal music moments.The film could use a few more of those instances and too often settles for bits that play like Wikipedia entries from N.W.A.s career (including appearances by actors playing Snoop Doggy Dogg and Tupac Shakur).Meanwhile the concert scenes including a pivotal moment at Joe Louis Arena in Detroit feel overly staged like concert scenes in movies too often do. And the ending feels arbitrary spotlighting a pivotal moment in Dres career but not in the story of the group.""Straight Outta Compton"" is ambitious but winds up taking on too much. Gray was entrusted with condensing down and presenting the breadth of N.W.A.s influence and power but N.W.A.s truth is more powerful than ""Straight Outta Comptons"" fiction.agrahamdetroitnews.comgrahamoramaStraight Outta ComptonGRADE C+Rated R for language throughout strong sexuality/nudity violence and drug useRunning time 150 minutes 61 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 8 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1NtDZkc MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/08/13/movie-review-straight-outta-compton-plays-straight/31667495/,200,straightouttacompton9,straightouttacompton,detroitnews

Five young African-Americans (played by OShea Jackson Jr. Corey Hawkins Jason Mitchell Neil Brown Jr. and Aldis Hodge) find their way out of variously difficult situations in mid-80s Los Angeles -- police brutality gang violence financial hardship social and racial roadblocks thwarted dreams etc. -- by laying down beats and rapping about them. Theres some grit at the get-go and some thrill at witnessing the development of a musical form. But the drama slows down once the money starts rolling in and the rappers chief antagonists become each other and maybe their manager. (""Slows down"" may be generous; movies have a tendency to stagnate when everybody stays essentially the same no matter how lively the events of the day.) By the time the 1992 LA riots explode onto the streets the members of Niggaz Wit Attitudes are reduced to watching it on TV and driving through the chaos looking concerned. And by the end the film drags into straight recent-history fanservice hey theres Snoop Dogg; hey theres Tupac; hey theres Dr. Dre selling Beats to Apple. Director F. Gary Gray (The Italian Job) makes a helluva music video -- the concert scenes here are among the most engaging -- but doesnt seem to have much taste for drilling into his characters.

"Review N.W.A film Straight Outta Compton starts fast but runs out of gas - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review N.W.A film Straight Outta Compton starts fast but runs out of gas Review N.W.A film Straight Outta Compton starts fast but runs out of gas Jaimie Trueblood / Universal Studios N.W.A members Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell) from left Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins) and Ice Cube (OShea Jackson Jr.) take center stage in ""Straight Outta Compton."" N.W.A members Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell) from left Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins) and Ice Cube (OShea Jackson Jr.) take center stage in ""Straight Outta Compton."" (Jaimie Trueblood / Universal Studios) Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter Alternately riveting and wearying up-to-the-minute relevant as well as self-mythologizingly self-indulgent -- as much of a heroic origins story as anything out of the Marvel factory -- ""Straight Outta Compton"" ends up juggling more story lines and moods than it can handle.It took 13 years to reach the screen required the efforts of four credited writers and runs a meandering 2 hours and 22 minutes so it might be expected that ""Straight Outta Compton"" is all over the map and it is. This was perhaps inevitable. To make a film version of the story of N.W.A the massively influential Compton-spawned rap group whose full name and best known song are still too incendiary for a family newspaper to publish director F. Gary Gray had to contend with a panoply of conflicting pressures.SIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter gt;gt; Those include tending to both the hard-core image of the group (lots of weapons lots more partially clothed women) and the personal agendas of former band members Ice Cube and Dr. Dre and Tomica Woods-Wright the widow of Eazy-E all of whom are hands-on executive producers. See the most-read entertainment stories gt;gt;Open link And how do you handle potentially litigious characters like rap mogul Marion ""Suge"" Knight who recently pleaded not guilty to a murder charge in an incident related to the film and controversial ex-N.W.A manager Jerry Heller who has already stated that on opening day ""I will be there in the front row with my lawyer.""Given that the script (credited to Jonathan Herman and Andrea Berloff based on a story by S. Leigh Savidge amp; Alan Wenkus and Berloff) reflects all these swirling demands its fortunate that director Gray has a history with the key players having made music videos for both Dre and Cube and directing the latters Hollywood breakout ""Friday."" Gray sees to it that the film starts out strongly bringing the kind of energy and anger against authority that lit up N.W.As music to what is in truth a surprisingly familiar tale. For its ironic that the most effective parts of ""Straight Outta Compton"" are its most standard. This story of a group of disadvantaged but talented young men from the same neighborhood fighting their way out of straitened circumstances to international pop music stardom has in outline a lot in common with the saga of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons as related in ""Jersey Boys"" -- though partisans of neither project will be happy with the comparison.Back we go to late-1980s Compton where cinematographer Matthew Libatiques gritty yet romanticized images introduce us to N.W.As members with special emphasis on the big three whom the film posits as crucial to its eventual success.First comes Eric Wright a.k.a. Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell) a man with a head for business shown finessing his way around a drug deal gone bad. Just maybe he starts to think there might be an easier way to make a living.Making a living is the last thing on the mind of Andre ""Dr. Dre"" Young (Corey Hawkins) a dazzling turntable wizard who lives for his music to such an extent that his mother worries that he wont amount to anything. (Having the last laugh on a whole string of naysayers is a persistent theme here.)As for OShea Jackson better known as Ice Cube (and played by the rappers son OShea Jackson Jr.) he lives to be writing what came to be known as gangsta rap but that he calls reality rap filled with lyrics alive to the constant drumbeat of police harassment in his Compton neighborhood.These words and the situations that called them forth do not unfortunately come off as quaint reminders of a bygone era. Rather given the disturbing headlines from around the country quite the opposite is true giving sections of the film an inescapable relevance.Despite the scorn of a club owner who tells them ""trust me this reality rap stuff isnt going to work 20 years from now youre going to thank me"" these three join with DJ Yella (Neil Brown Jr.) and MC Ren (Aldis Hodge) to form N.W.A which leads Dre to ask Eazy-E whether he ever thought about financing a record. (One of the films more charming sequences has Dr. Dre coaching the vocally shy Eazy-E through the recording of ""Cruisin Down Tha Street."")Its at this point that Heller he of the silver tongue with hair to match enters the picture. As played by Paul Giamatti -- fresh from a similar role in the Beach Boys drama ""Love amp; Mercy"" -- Heller is the first music establishment figure to believe in the band. He becomes their manager and along with Eazy-E co-founds the groups Ruthless Records label.------------FOR THE RECORDAug. 13 550 p.m. An earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to a Beach Boys movie as ""Love and Desire."" The correct title is ""Love amp; Mercy.""------------As N.W.A becomes more lucrative however success breeds dissension and rancorous inside-baseball legal disputes with Heller and others both influence Cube and Dre to leave the group and cause ""Straight Outta Compton"" to run out of gas.To its credit the film attempts to portray Heller evenhandedly even including a scene where he stands up for N.W.A to hostile police insisting that ""these are not gangbangers theyre artists.""Finally though free-floating resentment against Heller and other figures casts a shadow over everything and scenes of special pleading and self-justification inflate the running time to no dramatic purpose. Grievances about money and contracts whether justified or not rarely make for compelling cinema.""Our art is a reflection of our reality"" Ice Cube says to one of the films numerous fatuous journalists and thats a fair assessment of ""Straight Outta Compton"" itself. The groups members have become wealthy and influential enough to put their own vision of their lives on screen and for better or worse thats what theyve done.kenneth.turanlatimes.comMOREStraight Outta Compton film about N.W.A echoes the past and presentDr. Dre and Ice Cube relive youth on Straight Outta Compton setEazy-E obituary Rapper who put gangsta-rap and Compton on the pop culture map dies of AIDS at 31 FROM THE ARCHIVES If N.W.A keeps progressing it may become the most raw compelling L.A. group since Guns N RosesFROM THE ARCHIVES Wary N.W.A critic turned true believer Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Straight Outta Compton When straightoutta hit the red carpet in Los Angeles Full coverage Straight Outta Compton and N.W.As legacy Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad71deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-straight-outta-compton-review-20150814-column.html,200,straightouttacompton12,straightouttacompton,latimes

Jaimie Trueblood/Courtesy of Universal Pictures ""I can make you legit."" Thats the promise Jerry Heller a veteran rock manager makes to Eric ""Eazy-E"" Wright in an early scene in Straight Outta Compton a mostly exhilarating biopic about L.A. hip-hop legends N.W.A. The phrase missing from the end of that first sentence is ""...with the white people who hold all the power in the music industry."" It doesnt need to be said. Even with talents as electric as Andre Young and OShea Jackson--future icons wed come to know as Dr. Dre and Ice Cube respectively--N.W.A. cannot cross over to the mainstream without getting past white gatekeepers. And if that means signing on with a backroom operator like Heller the trade-off seems reasonable to five young men looking for a way out of the ghetto. They can renegotiate later. Named after N.W.A.s breakthrough album the sprawling Straight Outta Compton is about many things A watershed moment in music history past and present racial tensions connecting Rodney Kings L.A. to Michael Browns Ferguson the power of ""reality rap"" to tell uncomfortable truths and incite controversy. But above all the film celebrates the All-American values of hard work and entrepreneurship. It pays tribute to black artists who made themselves legit years after millions of album sales and sold-out arena shows failed to bring them real control of their careers. How do we know theyre legit now? Dr. Dre and Ice Cube produced this major-studio movie as a monument to their achievements. Theres no getting around the self-mythologizing aspect of a biopic produced by its subjects and the way it papers over less heroic facts about these men like Dres assault on journalist Dee Barnes. It would not be that cynical to call Straight Outta Compton an act of brand extension or a gauche attempt by hip-hop royalty to shape their cultural legacy. Director F. Gary Gray whose ties to Ice Cube go back to their 1995 comedy hit Friday starts with Eazy (Jason Mitchell) running drugs in Compton before taking his experience and business acumen into a more legitimate field. Looking for money to realize their musical ambitions Dre (Corey Hawkins) a virtuosic club DJ and Ice Cube (OShea Jackson Jr. Cubes real-life son) a ferocious lyricist and rapper turn to Eazy for funding and get more than they bargained for. Along with two other members MC Ren (Aldis Hodge) and DJ Yella (Neil Brown Jr.) they find some success in launching the Ruthless Records label but it isnt until Eazy strikes a deal with Heller that N.W.A. can get the distribution and promotion necessary to propel them to crossover superstardom. The recording of the Straight Outta Compton album and the cross-country bacchanal that followed is by far the strongest section of the film. Gray and his exuberant young cast seize on the joys of creative collaboration and the purity of art as an end in itself before larger cultural forces take hold and yank them in unwelcome directions. The tour crackles with thrilling volatility with the highs of live shows and hotel-room orgies checked by the lows of media scolds and First Amendment conflicts over the rage-filled anthem ""F The Police."" Even when theyre tossed into a paddy wagon in Detroit for allegedly instigating a riot theyre able to see it all as a grand cross-country adventure. Once the group splinters off into rival factions due mainly to Eazy and Hellers partnership freezing the others out Straight Outta Compton sags a little from a formlessness which plagues most artist biopics. In two-and-a-half hours the film dutifully ticks off the musicians greatest moments The founding of Death Row Records with the pathological Suge Knight (played by cigar-chomping fury by R. Marcos Taylor) the solo successes of Cubes AmeriKKKas Most Wanted and Dres The Chronic the ""eureka"" moment of Dre and Snoop Dogg stumbling on the keyboard riff for ""Nuthin But a G Thang."" As in life getting back to N.W.A. proves difficult for the movie to do. But if any film should be forgiven its excesses its Straight Outta Compton which is about the clashes and camaraderie among men whose unruliness sparked a cultural moment that was beyond their ability--and their willingness--to contain. Their story is too big for a single movie but Grays high-gloss abridgment latches on powerfully to their hard-won independence and self-actualization suggesting that true freedom is more difficult to achieve than success. For the members of N.W.A. escaping the slums is easier than getting out of a contract.

"Straight Outta Compton chronicles the dawn of gangster rap review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesStraight Outta Compton chronicles the dawn of gangster rap review N.W.A. biopic Straight Outta Compton uses fine performances to chronicle the rise breakups betrayals and infighting among the founders of gangster rap.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Aug. 13 2015Straight Outta Compton Starring OShea Jackson Jr. Corey Hawkins Jason Mitchell Neil Brown Jr. Aldis Hodge and Paul Giamatti. Directed by F. Gary Gray. 146 minutes. Opening Friday at major theatres. 18AOpening with the crash of a police battering ram into a drug house door N.W.A. biopic Straight Outta Compton makes that same thudding power echo in the thrill of a fresh track and the first rhymes from five young men who changed the music landscape nearly 30 years ago.The swagger that made them call themselves N.W.A. -- N----z With Attitude -- and their fury and frustration about issues of race and police brutality in the late 1980s still echoing in headlines today (and the cops dont come off at all well in Compton) -- fuels every incendiary moment of the onscreen rise breakups betrayals and infighting among these founders of gangster rap.Article Continued BelowLike protest singers and punk N.W.A. was a musical expression of the artists world a chance to speak their truth. Forged in the gang and drug-damaged L.A. neighbourhood of Compton N.W.A. was formed by dealer-turned-rapper Eazy-E (a fascinating multi-layered performance from Jason Mitchell) with DJ-turned-producer Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins) DJ Yella (Neil Brown Jr.) teen poet-cum-lyricst Ice Cube (OShea Jackson Jr. real-life son of Cube making his screen debut in convincing fashion) and MC Ren (Aldis Hodge). From left Aldis Hodge as MC Ren Neil Brown Jr. as DJ Yella Jason Mitchell as Eazy-E OShea Jackson Jr. as Ice Cube and Corey Hawkins as Dr. Dre in the film Straight Outta Compton.Even as they spit misogynistic violent rhymes about guns and drugs it seems these guys had softer sides that the filmmakers and producers Dr. Dre Ice Cube and Eazy-Es widow Tomica Woods-Wright are anxious to showcase.Outwardly chill in reality forming label Ruthless Records and recording a first track wasnt a smooth process. Eazy-Es first attempt with Ice Cubes ""Boyz-n-the-Hood"" rhymes was a disaster not the last time screenwriters Jonathan Herman and Andrea Berloff lighten the mood with sharp dialogue and humour that not only coveys their closeness but helps make them seem more relatable.The disc is a hit and the bands white manager Jerry Heller (a very good Paul Giamatti in a horrible white wig and velour track suit) arrives promising legitimacy to the performers.He seems to have their backs when cops humiliate the five outside a recording session (an incident that inspired Ice Cubes controversial ""F--- tha Police). But Hellers allegiance was more to his own bottom line and his alliance with Eazy-E inserts permanent wedges.Director F. Gary Gray alternates between gritty documentary-style close-ups and dreamy California sunsets infusing scenes with pastel orange glow and a smoky haze. Meanwhile cinematographer Matthew Libatique swoops around a sex-and-guns fuelled hotel suite party and a poolside Bacchanal (women here are either annoying or naked) with the same edge-of-your-seat intensity given to the electric onstage performances. The furious onscreen energy of the groups rise cant be sustained and too-long Compton clocking in at nearly 2.5 hours flags midway before finding its feet again in poignant fashion with Eazy-Es diagnosis with HIV (he died in1995 at age 31) and opportunities to heal past rifts.The movies hits-jammed soundtrack will please fans; in fact everything about Straight Outta Compton is for them including the final over-the-credits roll of vintage clips and a reminder that Dr. Dre the guy who started out sleeping on his moms couch has done very well for himself indeed.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Except for Eric Wright/Eazy-E the core members of the influential hip-hop group N.W.A. prospered and after fighting for respect as gangsta rappers have moved into the mainstream of American culture. So the music biopic Straight Outta Compton is their story as shaped and supervised by Ice Cube and Dr. Dre. As a result F. Gary Grays excellent film is as sympathetic as it is bombastic even when it depicts some of the rough stuff a lot of the stupid excesses that come with fame and even some quasi-criminal activities. Straight Outta Compton also depicts certain members of the Los Angeles Police Department as racist thugs who harass young black men including the members of N.W.A. for no reason other than their age and the colour of their skin. The film also blames the Detroit police department for inciting the infamous riot at an N.W.A. concert in that city because of controversy over the groups abrasive song F--- tha Police. Racial profiling is of course a controversial topic that is as relevant in todays America as it was when N----- Wit Attitudes first laid down the tracks for their debut album in 1988. Not coincidentally that album gives the film its provocative title. Compton a city in Los Angeles County just south of downtown L.A. is notorious for its black and Hispanic gang violence. Yet none of the N.W.A. members -- except for Eazy-E who sold drugs and used his profits to bankroll N.W.A. and Ruthless Records in their formative years -- were actually ever involved in the gangster world. At least not as they are depicted here. Grays film which was co-produced by Ice Cube and Dr. Dre (among others) has a rough kinetic energy. It is sometimes hilarious sometimes crude often sophisticated unfortunately sexist and always profane. Critically it showcases the street-tough music and rap lyrics that made N.W.A. so effective in shaping American popular music in the 1980s. Close your eyes and sections of the film sound like an N.W.A. greatest hits collection. It helps in the storytelling of course that the core members are dramatized so brilliantly. Jason Mitchell is a breakout performer as Eric Wright/Eazy-E the charismatic co-founder who also destroyed the group through his shady business practices. Wright died of AIDS in 1995 mourned by his friends despite profound differences over money and power. Mitchell runs the gamut from juvenile bravado through cunning and into pathos. You get Eazy-Es sensibilities. The portrayal of OShea Jackson/Ice Cube is equally interesting. He is played by OShea Jackson Jr. who does a splendid job of conjuring his fathers emotions as well as his looks. Having first encountered Ice Cube during the release of the now legendary gangsta movie Boyz n the Hood in 1991 it is uncanny how well Jackson Jr. brings out that same energy intelligence and attitude of his father as a young man. Corey Hawkins is the third pillar of strength as Andre Young/Dr. Dre. Not only does Hawkins look a lot like him he has the acting chops to demonstrate why Dr. Dre was critical to the musical success of N.W.A. and why he was so conflicted inside the machinations of the group. For the record other key characters play into the saga but N.W.A. members Lorenzo Patterson/MC Ren (played by Aldis Hodge) and Antoine Carraby/DJ Yella (played by Neil Brown Jr.) are given short shrift. More critical are the portrayals of N.W.A.s first manager Jerry Heller (played by Paul Giamatti) as a scam artist and also of Marion Suge Knight (played by R. Marcus Taylor) as a brutal thug who ran Death Row Records as a private club for deviants. In the end part of the N.W.A. story is told -- and told extremely well -- yet this compelling saga is not over yet.

The flagrantly unbowed N.W.A. pioneers of ""reality rap"" (we now call it gangsta) very much deserves its own movie--thats not a premise to argue with. But is F. Gary Grays often sentimental occasionally dull Straight Outta Compton the best version of that movie? Only partly. Theres enjoyable humor (and beautiful acting) as brow-furrowed rhyme-scribbling teen Ice Cube (OShea Jackson Jr. Cubes real son) shrewd drug dealer Eric ""Eazy-E"" Wright (Jason Mitchell) and frustrated DJ Andre (Corey Hawkins) come together in the studio hatch Ruthless Records and miracle a brilliant single into being 1987s ""Boyz-n-the-Hood."" But the film could have used more than its whiff of radical revolution which we get in scenes where the band is hassled by cops for simply standing on the corner. Invading a mainstream that would soon be dominated by Vanilla Ice N.W.A. came across like terrorists and Straight Outta Compton largely forgets to include that larger cultural revulsion apart from a couple of snobby Peter Jennings clips. Meanwhile the groups Jewish manager (Paul Giamatti) goes from friend to enemy the city of Los Angeles explodes during the 1992 Rodney King riots and were meant to be dramatically satisfied by...contract disputes? Theres way too much inside-baseball money talk here when a simpler plot--one about a band whose apocalyptic vision comes to pass--would have been plenty.

The 1990s were further reincarnated with accurately detailed sets including pimped-out low riders and one scene of a ridiculous poolside party.With impeccable acting the stars were surely snubbed for an Oscar nomination.The actors playing Ice Cube Dre and Easy E so embodied their characters you would hardly believe they hadnt shuttled the real men back in a Delorean.And to state the obvious you cant beat the soundtrack.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 25 2016Brian MFeaturedNamed after the album and song of the same name this movie follows the early lives of the key members of the monumental rap act N.W.A.   Unfortunately I felt the move provides too much after story including Suge Knight and Death Row.  I was hoping to learn more about the band coming together and putting out such an influential album.  Their subsequent tour was glossed over as well and it would have been interesting how the shows went over and what the response was.  Dr. Dre smoking ""chronic"" and then being inspired by it you saw coming a mile away.  When Snoop Dogg comes in and hears Dres song he immediately raps over it with the familiar opening to ""Nuthin But a G-Thing"". It could not have been that easy.  Reminiscent of when Ray Manzarek in the Doors movie wrote the opening to ""Light My Fire"" in like 4 seconds.  Id say it was done for brevity but since the movie is almost 2.5 hours long I don think so. Anyhow the movie was a decent history of the band N.W.A and their impact on music.

Share This Story Share Discuss Meh Of all the improbable fates that awaited N.W.A. from Dr. Dres status as a headphone tycoon to Ice Cubes ascension as a family movie mogul this one might be the most remarkable.The original shock troops of gangsta rap now have their own conventional rock biopic in Straight Outta Compton a highly entertaining if overlong chronicle that hits all the beats familiar to the genre. It doesnt get much more mainstream than that.Here we see the five core members as young men dealing with the random police harassment and street violence of 1980s Los Angeles. We track the three most visionary Ice Cube (OShea Jackson Jr. son of the real Cube) Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins) and Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell) as they carve out their place in hip-hop history. Their squabbles mostly over money spring to life. They rise from nondescript houses on dangerous streets to palatial mansions and bacchanalian pool parties. They dont stray too far from the madding crowd. Along the way were treated to a few surprises sprinkled in with the predictable arc. First and foremost Straight Outta Compton can be sidesplittingly funny and not in an unintentional way. Director F. Gary Gray and a team of five writers show an alert ear for black vernacular especially the ways in which young men joke around with each other and laugh to keep from crying (though they do some of that as well). The film is well-attuned to the surreal tragicomic nature of banding together in the face of everyday persecution. Straight Outta Big D How we do the N.W.A. meme in North Texas Straight Outta Compton is strongest in its first half which shows us the future stars as hungry underdogs dealing with the consequences of being the wrong color in the eyes of law enforcement (a theme with clear resonance in todays headlines). Young black men in the age of chief Daryl Gates LAPD could expect a violent and humiliating routine. Hands behind your head. Prepare to get slammed face first into the hood of the nearest car. Didnt do anything wrong? Shut up. No drugs on you? Have a nice day.In the movie the members of N.W.A. receive such treatment outside the Torrance studio where theyre recording their first album. The experience inspires Cube to pen the groups incendiary calling card ""[Expletive] the Police."" Later we see them individually watching the Rodney King coverage on TV and driving through the riots that followed the not-guilty verdict. Jason Mitchell as Eazy-E in ""Straight Outta Compton."" Universal Pictures Straight Outta Compton captures the milieu of N.W.A.s time and place in vivid detail. The cast is uniformly excellent; Jacksons ability to capture his dads mannerisms especially the charismatic scowl is uncanny.The thorny relationship between the group and its manager Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti) gets full treatment as does the rise of Death Row Records kingpin Suge Knight (R. Marcos Taylor). The D.O.C. (Marlon Yates Jr.) an N.W.A. member from Dallas is a featured character.Plot lines aplenty populate Straight Outta Compton and at about the halfway point they start to pile up. In this sense the movie is plagued by the pitfalls of most rise-fall-rise-again music biopics. Theres a reluctance to trim the fat here which will happen when two of the principal subjects Cube and Dre are also producers.Straight Outta Compton manages to keep its sharp teeth despite its adherence to form. The movie doesnt neuter N.W.A.s story so much as mold it to a familiar model. If you were listening back in the day you couldnt have seen that coming.Straight Outta Compton (B+)Directed by F. Gary Gray. R (language throughout strong sexuality/nudity violence and drug use). 127 mins. In wide release. Goes Well With...

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint When Dr. Dre sold his Beats headphones company to Apple for 3 billion last year his stake in that transaction made him the richest man in hip-hop. The deal was likely struck in some ivory tower boardroom but the vehicle that propelled Andre Young (as his mother named him) to that apex of success was gangsta rap -- the genre he helped pioneer and sell like hot cakes to mainstream white America. Dres brand of rugged explicit rap music was born far away from the corporate world in the small decaying L.A. hub city of Compton. In the fiery new biopic ""Straight Outta Compton"" the neighborhoods where Dre and his friends reside look and feel more like a police state -- a powder keg ready to spark what they call ""reality rap."" Dramatizing the formation of his influential group N.W.A. the film is a sprawling pulsating nonstop feat of filmmaking that follows the young men to the heights of hedonistic rap stardom. But it starts very small. Specifically in a drug house in 1986 where Dres childhood acquaintance Eric ""Eazy-E"" Wright is collecting a debt. In an instant a police tank outfitted with a steel battering ram smashes through the front door sending Eazy off running -- and yearning for a way out of the small-time drug trade. He finds what hes looking for in Dre who is tired of spinning cheesy 80s Ramp;B at the neighborhood disco. Played with steely-eyed focus by Corey Hawkins Dre wants to perform music that mirrors the brutal everyday experience of living in Compton. As the movie depicts with dizzying handheld camerawork young black men like Dre are regularly stopped for ""looking like gangbangers"" and then cuffed and slammed onto the hot hoods of police cruisers by nightstick-wielding cops. Using Eazys small savings of drug money the duo buy studio time and form N.W.A. with OShea Jackson (aka Ice Cube) MC Ren and DJ Yella. Clubgoers in Compton like what they hear. Soon the guys hook up with a slimy manager played with reptilian verve by Paul Giamatti and release their breakthrough debut ""Straight Outta Compton."" Jaimie Trueblood  Universal Pictures Corey Hawkins stars as Dr. Dre in ""Straight Outta Compton."" The result They fill arenas and Tom Brokaw is on TV lambasting their celebration of excess and defiance. The group even receives a letter from the FBI demanding they stop performing the hit song ""[Expletive] tha Police."" They play it anyway at their next concert. Movies like this live and die on the casting of their famous protagonists -- and ""Straight Outta Compton"" is pitch perfect. Jason Mitchell captures the strange dynamism of Eazy-E -- hes menacing but also provides jester-like comic relief. In what couldve been a disaster Ice Cubes son OShea Jackson Jr. plays his fathers part exceptionally right down to Dads trademark smirk. In the small pool of big-budget hip-hop biopics ""Straight Outta Compton"" is near the top. For comparison the Eminem-starring ""8 Mile"" and the Biggie Smalls feature ""Notorious"" come to mind. ""8 Mile"" smartly focused on a short snapshot of Eminems beginnings -- a textured portrait of the artist clawing his way through underground Detroit. ""Notorious"" embraced the Wikipedia approach piling up a highlight reel of Biggies entire career but never stopping to get the viewer invested. ""Straight Outta Compton"" finds a healthy middle ground. The second half of the movie re-enacts N.W.A.s well-documented misadventures in the record industry including the groups bitter breakup and Eazys battle with AIDS. Its here where the 21/2-hour running time lags a bit as director F. Gary Gray packs inasmuch as he can. There are fun scenes where Dre collaborates with future stars such as Snoop Dogg and Tupac Shakur. The actors portraying these hip-hop titans do so with uncanny mimicry but it feels forced and unnecessary. The power and impact of ""Compton"" rest in its scenes of resistance. Much of this takes place in the films riveting first hour. The armored police vehicle in the opening scene looks like something out of Fallujah -- or Ferguson for that matter. In fact the violent street imagery coursing through the movie eerily alludes to the recent unrest following the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner at the hands of police officers. Even when the members of N.W.A. become rich and famous they cant escape the images of police brutality that occupy the films first half. From his mansion in 1991 Eazy grimaces as he watches the Rodney King beating on TV and later the not-guilty verdicts. Los Angeles soon erupts in flames -- the groups music foretelling this cataclysm. At a news conference Ice Cube says ""You cant treat people like that and expect them not to rise up."" These days the real-life Dr. Dre (and Ice Cube too) are millionaire entrepreneurs busy with corporate investments movie deals and other ventures. But once they were just young men looking for an outlet to vent. When the focus is on those moments ""Straight Outta Compton"" soars. thorgenstartribune.com 612-673-7909 tomhorgen View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Johnson St. Louis Post-Dispatch Kevin C. Johnson Aug 14 2015 (...) Theres a pitifully stirring scene in hip-hop biopic ""Straight Outta Compton"" that grips viewers not in whats depicted but that whats depicted is still happening.In this story of legendary Compton Calif. rap act N.W.A. the group is taking a break outside of the recording studio when police officers violently harass the young men for just standing around.Its a heavy scene to watch in light of the ongoing news of discord between officers and black males and a painful example of the films relevancy. Director F. Gary Gray has helmed a new standard for the hip-hop biopic with ""Straight Outta Compton"" epic in both scope and length.""Straight Outta Compton"" traces N.W.A.s rise and fall its short but pioneering life. The controversial act dubbed the worlds most dangerous group gave the world Dr. Dre Ice Cube Eazy E DJ Yella and MC Ren.The story begins in Compton 1986 as viewers are introduced to rapper-producer Dre (Corey Hawkins) and rapper-writer Cube (OShea Jackson Jr. portraying a spot-on younger version of his father Ice Cube). They are with rapper Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell) who narrowly escapes a drug deal that goes haywire in the films opening scene.Anchored by Eazy-Es crackling debut single ""Boyz-n-the-Hood"" and his co-founding of Ruthless Records N.W.A. is born. (Use Google if you dont know what those initials stand for.)Under the watchful eye of unscrupulous manager Jerry Heller (a game Paul Giamatti) we see the making of the 1988 album ""Straight Outta Compton"" an angry in-your-face record that unapologetically reveals the groups frustrations. The album hits in a big way and is quickly labeled ""gangsta rap"" though the group preferred the term ""reality rap"" as the men saw themselves reporting on whats really going on in the streets. They riled up many people including the F.B.I. and the movie shows the group turning threats from the agency into publicity.The group goes sour quickly as Cube notices Eazy-E is the only one with a formal contract and that Eazy-E and Heller are kicking back at lobster brunches while the rest of the men eat at burger joints. Cube goes solo and trades insults with his former groupmates while Dre draws the attention of hulking ex-bodyguard Suge Knight (R. Marcus Taylor) who will steal him away at whatever brutal costs. The group members stories are overly familiar to rap fans as are portrayals of the big bad music industry in general but that doesnt take away from the films dramatic tension.Snoop Dogg (Keith Stanfield) and 2Pac (Marcc Rose) two stars who would be affiliated later in the life of Dr. Dre are depicted briefly along with quick throwaway references to Bone Thugs-N-Harmony a group Eazy-E put on the map and Cubes movies ""Friday"" and ""Boyz N the Hood.""Cube Dre and Eazy-Es widow are among the films producers and the portrayals come off as positively as expected especially Cube and Dres. You wont find any reference to Dres 1991 assault of TV host Dee Barnes. But the men are not depicted as angels either dallying in levels of gunplay and misogyny.Credit goes to smart casting of unknowns in the leads who click uniformly; a packed script that manages not to feel overly long and social commentary that is timeless.What ""Straight Outta Compton""  Three and a half stars out of four  Run time 227  Rating R  Content Language strong sexuality/nudity violence and drug use Kevin C.

It does. But not so much that you ever want to leave its danger zone. Straight Outta Compton is epic baby an explosively entertaining hip-hop biopic that raps home truths about race and police brutality as timely now (think Ferguson) as they were during the 1980s in Compton California. Thats where five black teens -- known as Dr. Dre Ice Cube Eazy-E DJ Yella and MC Ren -- channeled their fury into the beats of N.W.A short for Niggaz With Attitude. The band didnt invent gangsta rap but N.W.A were sure as shit there in the delivery room sparked by near-constant rousting from the LAPD. Director F. Gary Gray working from a script by Jonathan Herman and Andrea Berloff doesnt supply halos for his protagonists. Sex drugs and the thug life figure prominently. Assign any soft-pedaling to the fact that Dre and Cube now media moguls are among the films producers and that Gray directed Cube videos and his 1995 stoner comedy Friday. More News Ice Cube on Reliving N.W.A for Straight Outta Compton Dr. Dre Talks N.W.A Biopic Eazy-Es Death New Music Reality Bites The 25 Best and Worst Biopics 10 Things You Learn About Dr. Dre on Compton All Stories >> Related N.W.A Tell All Inside the Original Gangstas Cover Story The former N.W.A legends go deep on their triumphs and controversies The atmosphere is charged as cinematographer Matthew Libatique creates striking visuals that pull us into the fray. Cubes look-alike son OShea Jackson Jr. does a smashing job playing his dad blending sensitivity with seething intensity. Its Cube and his buddy DJ Andre ""Dr. Dre"" Young (a charmingly sly Corey Hawkins) who persuade drug dealer Eric ""Eazy-E"" Wright (Jason Mitchell) to finance a label Ruthless Records. Mitchells fierce portrayal of the mercurial Eazy (who died of AIDS complications in 1995) is award-caliber especially when he haltingly then thrillingly lays down vocals on ""Boyz-n-the-Hood."" The recording sessions featuring Neil Brown Jr. and Aldis Hodge in lesser roles as DJ Yella and MC Ren pack the vital spark of live performance. But its Cube who puts N.W.A on the map with his incendiary ""Fuck Tha Police."" The films righteous highlight is a Detroit concert where the cops threaten to jail the bandmates and shut the place down if they sing the rap that has demonized N.W.A to Middle America. Of course they sing it. And the crowd roars. The movie is never as potent as it is in that groundbreaking moment when artists and audiences connect. But credit Gray for tracing the groups rise and fall with dramatic vigor. The bands white manager Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti) instigates a rift that sends Cube on his own and Dre into an unholy alliance with Death Row Records founder Marion ""Suge"" Knight (a very scary R. Marcos Taylor). Straight Outta Compton plays better when its outside the box showing us N.W.A power and the consequences of abusing it. Would the movie be better if it didnt sidestep the bands misogyny gay-bashing and malicious infighting? No shit. But what stands is an amazement an electrifying piece of hip-hop history that speaks urgently to right now.

Longtime admirers of the Los Angeles ensemble which helped create West Coast gangsta rap with its confrontational lyrics and defiant physically aggressive performance will surely flock to this long-awaited chronicle of the bands swift rise. Theyll be pleased by this portrait of newly minted artists as combative wildly gifted -- if not always self-controlled -- young men. But ""Compton"" deserves a much wider reach than the groups hard-core fans. Thanks to eerily on-point timing and adroit direction from F. Gary Gray this classic star-is-born story manages to transcend its own tight focus. Even viewers who think N.W.A. is an airline will probably be electrified by a story that while succumbing to its share of hagiography still puts its subjects in context as avatars not just of their time and place but of our own. As the film makes clear the unfiltered rage that got the band into so much trouble -- with parental groups federal authorities radio stations and censorious social critics -- had its roots in grim realities that are all too palpable today. [Straight Outta Compton N.W.A. and the new vernacular of protest] The story begins in the mid-1980s when South Central Los Angeles was awash in crack cocaine gang violence and the battering rams and helicopter searchlights of the citys notoriously overzealous police department. With the help of on-screen titles the audience is introduced to the three main players in N.W.A.s formation and eventual success Eric Wright (Jason Mitchell) a scrappy bantamweight dealer at the lower level of the drug trade; OShea Jackson (OShea Jackson Jr.) a high school student who writes rhymes on the school bus while his white classmates listen to Tears for Fears; and Andre Young (Corey Hawkins) a producer friend of Jacksons who DJs at a local club where the manager pooh-poohs their hard-edged collaborations in favor of dance-friendly slow jams. The audience is introduced to the three main players in rap group N.W.A.s formation and eventual success from left Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins) Ice Cube (played by his real-life son OShea Jackson Jr.) and Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell). (Jaimie Trueblood/Universal Pictures) These three young men would later become famous as Eazy-E Ice Cube and Dr. Dre who along with Dres original partner DJ Yella (Neil Brown Jr.) and later MC Ren (Aldis Hodge) formed what would be known as N.W.A. an abbreviation for the less printable N----z With Attitudes. ""Straight Outta Compton"" thrillingly revisits the groups early recording sessions and initial rise to fame. Young green and volatile these natural writers performers and producers are portrayed as creatures of spontaneous instinct rather than crass calculation or cynicism. When Eazy-E joins forces with a manager named Jerry Heller the more seasoned showman immediately sees lightning ripe for bottling. Heller happens to be played by Paul Giamatti and as anyone who has seen ""Love amp; Mercy"" knows when he shows up in a musical biopic it doesnt bode well. The film is wildly entertaining as the members of N.W.A. go from neighborhood heroes -- their singles blaring from low-rider speakers and corner boom boxes -- to bona fide stars selling out arenas and alarming older mostly white listeners appalled at titles like ""Gangsta Gangsta"" and ""F--- tha Police."" Perhaps most important Gray has assembled a pitch-perfect cast to portray the band including Ice Cubes real-life son who bears an uncanny resemblance to the bearish perpetually scowling rapper. In addition to writing and performing Ice Cubes scenes mostly pivot around him asking Heller and Eazy-E -- with increasing suspicion -- about such nagging issues as compensation contracts and what look like secretive side deals. Meanwhile a bearded physically imposing acquaintance of Dres named Suge Knight (R. Marcos Taylor) begins to lurk in the background a quietly menacing eminence grise whose presence grows more pronounced and malign as N.W.A. grows in stature. Ice Cubes contract disputes and Dres association with Knight would ultimately spell the end of N.W.A. which ""Straight Outta Compton"" illustrates dutifully and to a fault along with the AIDS to which Eazy-E succumbed in 1995. After a lively engrossing often funny first hour or so the film begins to feel repetitive baggy and bogged down in the factual details of Ice Cubes dissatisfaction and Dres disillusionment with Knight -- even with such delicious details as Dre discovering Snoop Dogg and Tupac Shakur (Marcc Rose also flawlessly cast) and Ice Cube fooling around with a little script called ""Friday."" That little side project would prove to be his breakout role (directed incidentally by Gray who cant resist an inside joke; its a deathlessly funny line from the film here delivered at the expense of a pointedly half-naked woman). Yet ""Straight Outta Compton"" never addresses much less questions the misogyny embedded in so much of N.W.A.s lyrics. Perhaps unsurprisingly for a film produced by Ice Cube Dre and Eazy-Es widow the subjects are portrayed as flawed but well-intentioned family men and visionary artists. (The last point is convincingly proved in a triumphant end-credits sequence.) Simply as a rags-to-riches story ""Straight Outta Compton"" would be an engaging ride through a storied chapter of pop culture -- helped considerably by its consistently impressive ensemble of promising young actors. But the film gains meaning and emotional heft from its context -- in this case a time period bracketed by the over-policing of South Central and the beating of Rodney King and subsequent riots. Theres no doubt that N.W.A.s stage persona was just that -- a collective pose of bravado and affected overcompensating swagger. But the film deftly illustrates the forces that pushed the group members and their colleagues to strike those poses and why they were so valorized for pushing back at least symbolically. The films climactic scene takes place in Detroit where N.W.A. performs ""F--- tha Police"" in an act of unbridled defiance (by this time theyve come under the scrutiny of local law enforcement and the FBI who accused the group of inciting violence). The sequence which ends with the very violence that N.W.A.s critics had feared has the discomfiting dual effect of feeling both lamentable and defiant as white and black fans alike raise middle fingers in febrile solidarity. N.W.A.s music might have fused seamlessly with the larger youth cultures sense of rebellion. But theres never been any doubt that their outrage was specific personal and as Gray depicts it acutely socially aware. As enlightening as it is entertaining as sobering as it is exhilarating ""Straight Outta Compton"" reminds viewers not only who N.W.A. were and what they meant but also why they mattered -- and still do.

"Straight Outta Compton review N.W.As ride to stardom - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Straight Outta Compton review N.W.As ride to stardom Straight Outta Compton Jaimie Trueblood / Universal Pictures Aldis Hodge from left Neil Brown Jr. Jason Mitchell OShea Jackson Jr. and Corey Hawkins portray N.W.A in the biopic ""Straight Outta Compton."" Aldis Hodge from left Neil Brown Jr. Jason Mitchell OShea Jackson Jr. and Corey Hawkins portray N.W.A in the biopic ""Straight Outta Compton."" (Jaimie Trueblood / Universal Pictures) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Its either a good week or a terrible week to revisit N.W.As song about the police. ""Straight Outta Compton"" is a musically propulsive mixed blessing of a biopic made the way these things often get made with the real-life protagonists breathing down the movies neck to make sure nothing too harsh or unflattering gets in the way of the telling.Three of the films producers are Ice Cube (born OShea Jackson) Dr. Dre (Andre Young) and Tomica Woods-Wright the widow of Eric ""Eazy-E"" Wright. As relayed by director F. Gary Gray the rise of South Central LA hip-hop revolutionaries N.W.A begins in Compton Calif. in 1986 and ends less than a decade later with Eazys AIDS-related death in 1995. By then N.W.A had altered American culture and mainstreamed gangsta rap along with gangsta misogyny tilting hip-hop from the East Coast to the West fomenting musical rivalries and nervous debate about the groups value all along the way. The first half of the film features the fun stuff; in any musical biopic the road to stardom is more involving than second-act discussions of management contracts.We meet young Cube played by Ice Cubes son OShea Jackson Jr. as he and up-and-coming deejay Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins) persuade drug-dealing Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell) to funnel some of his profits into a new record label Ruthless Records. ""Straight Outta Compton"" leans heavily on the creation of N.W.As 1988 studio bombshell of the same name. The closer the film sticks to the recording booth -- with one striking exception -- the more vivid its impact. The exception is a scene eerily on point with the headlines coming out of Ferguson Mo. this week. Taking a break from recording the album Cube Dr. Dre and company are standing outside the studio in Torrance Calif. when local police roll up and the accusations and troubles begin. Paul Giamatti plays the groups manager Jerry Heller who at this point has not yet shown the movies version of Hellers true stripes. The cops shake down the young men and denigrate the very existence of rap music. Describing what happens in this scene makes it sound corny and false but as it plays out the tension feels real and emotionally authentic. Then in a quick cut N.W.As most famous provocation -- the one well call ""To Blazes With Tha Law Enforcement Officials"" is being recorded and becomes a national anthem for millions.

Mitchells Eazy emerges as the films most complicated figure throwing his lot in with a manager who may not have his best interests at heart. The wives girlfriends and groupies come and go fleetingly often nude more often scolds or drags on the good times.As shaped by screenwriters Jonathan Herman and Andrea Berloff ""Straight Outta Compton"" alternates between party scenes filmed by director Gray exactly as if they were hip-hop videos (the objectifying perspectives never change only the posteriors) and confrontations or reconciliations. A tougher-minded biopic I think wouldve had the nerve to acknowledge some of the groups seamier material and its role in the groups international success.Similarly theres no mention of Dre pleading no contest to the brutal beating of TV host Dee Barnes. Ice Cube recently told Grantland ""We made a pact that if they do anything to Hollywood this movie we outta here."" But Hollywooding a true story can mean many different things. ""Straight Outta Compton"" at its best evokes the heady atmosphere of Crenshaw Boulevard and what the groups success meant to Compton and vice versa. When the songs themselves take center stage the movie works. What remains in the wings constitutes another fuller story.

(Photo courtesy Universal Pictures/TNS) Photo Handout McClatchy-Tribune News Service Outta Compton Reflective rappers express themselves 1 / 2 Back to Gallery ""Our art is a reflection of our reality"" the rapper Ice Cube tells an interviewer in the middle of the N.W.A. biopic ""Straight Outta Compton."" The line is delivered by 24-year-old OShea Jackson Jr. who is better than any special effect so far this summer. The son of the real Ice Cube looks and sounds and feels so much the way his father did in 1991 that every word seems like an eerie message from the past. The timing is right to tell the story of Niggaz Wit Attitudes and ""Straight Outta Compton"" is an entertaining and reflective exploration of the outlaw rappers. Although it earns its R rating in nearly every scene the films vibe is closer to ""The Social Network"" than ""Menace II Society"" choosing to romanticize the merits of the music and the relation between art and commerce not the violence that was interconnected with the groups rise and fall. ""Straight Outta Compton"" is produced by Ice Cube Dr. Dre and Eazy-Es widow Tomica Woods-Wright. None of the filmmakers seem obsessed with settling old scores. The rappers tore each other up enough in their youth trading hostilities in a series of post-N.W.A. solo albums. With that lyrical carpet-bombing more than 20 years in the past this movie is about the lessons learned. Director F. Gary Gray settles into a serviceable chronological structure supplementing the dramatized storytelling with real news footage up to the movies abrupt finish. Ice Cube Dre (Corey Hawkins) and Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell) are introduced in the 1980s as charismatic young residents of the Southern California town of Compton who have talent survival skills and a pretty good plan but little business sense. They meet Jerry Heller and Suge Knight (Paul Giamatti and R. Marcus Taylor) whose entrepreneurial motives helped bring N.W.A. to a premature end. This recurring hypothesis -- that the band could have done even greater things if it had stayed together -- is the major narrative flaw of the movie. The early breakup of N.W.A. fueled Ice Cubes growth as an MC and Dres greatness as a producer and divining rod for talent. Very few sane rap fans would trade one more full-cast N.W.A. album for ""AmeriKKKas Most Wanted"" ""The Chronic"" and Snoop Doggs ""Doggystyle"" all classic albums that used the trauma of bad N.W.A. blood as artistic motivation. The filmmakers generally chose acting talent over casting look-alikes and Gray could have used some of ""The Hobbit"" director Peter Jacksons resizing magic. This movies Suge Knight is a little small Eazy-E is too tall and Snoop Dogg is about half a foot too short. But the cast of mostly unknown actors blend into the history of their roles to the point where its a distraction every time Heller comes on the screen. (""Whats Paul Giamatti in a white wig doing in these home movies from N.W.A.?"") Jackson is a standout as his father Ice Cube down to every head-cocked glare and lip quiver. Please Hollywood dont ever remake ""Boyz n the Hood."" But if you absolutely have to do it right now and use this guy. For those who dont know the story ""Straight Outta Compton"" provides an effective argument for the importance of the group and their representation of a black population that felt under siege long before the Rodney King beating in Los Angeles. N.W.A.s musical response to authority considered shocking at the time the groups first album was released seems almost measured in the Ferguson/Black Lives Matter era. Fans of the group are rewarded even more getting an inside look at events that previously could only be imagined. Its a rare cinematic treat to see the rest of N.W.A. reacting to an Ice Cube diss track for the first time in a movie made by people who were probably in that room. Gray who has a deep history with N.W.A. members as a music video director crams a receiving line of rap royalty into the 157-minute running time. (Eminem just misses the cutoff; the film covers a full decade ending in 1996.) Police journalists who dislike rap and Suge Knight will find little to enjoy in this movie -- all are portrayed as villains with zero subtlety. But the film as a whole is critical of its heroes mistakes. ""Dont get high on your own supply"" the group once rapped. The message was originally about dope but it applies equally to biopic filmmaking. Now in middle age members of N.W.A. no longer believe all of the hype. Theyre in an introspective space to the great benefit of this film. Peter Hartlaub is The San Francisco Chronicles pop culture critic. E-mail phartlaubsfchronicle.com Twitter PeterHartlaub.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Devils bargains rivalries decadence violence tragedy. The story of N.W.A. is pure opera but Straight Outta Compton F. Gary Grays fitfully interesting portrayal of the group only realizes its potential when it applies an exaggerated touch--like say setting the swoosh of the Universal logo to the thump-thump-thump of a police helicopter or staging Dr. Dres split with Suge Knight in a smoky red boardroom divided by an open door of blinding light. Aside from these few flourishes of the outre and symbolically charged theres little to distinguish the movie from any number of overlong hit-by-hit music biopics of the nodding-approvingly-from-behind-a-mixing-console variety. Money and success are generally the two least interesting things about musicians lives and that goes double for gangsta rap which sold itself partly on attitude and backstory. What this means for Straight Outta Compton is that the movie is a heck of a lot more compelling in retelling N.W.A.s beginnings and inspirations than in outlining its assorted financial and contractual disputes even when one takes into account the presence of Knight a Mephistopheles figure with a knack for turning paperwork into a life-or-death situation. Comptons first third--which follows the groups early years in the eponymous Los Angeles suburb--finds Gray doing his best Scorsese complete with long showy Steadicam and crane shots. Then comes the big money and the bad blood that goes with it and the movie sputters into a loop of arguments over fine print and events being acknowledged in passing none of it made any clearer by the fact that 90s rappers mansions all basically looked the same. (One comes to appreciate the way Hype Williams Belly--a film thats aged surprisingly well--goes out of its way to make white-walled staircase-dominated luxury spaces look interesting.) This is the sort of thing thats usually carried at least in part by performance and could be if Comptons characters were half as complicated and conflicted as the real-life personalities they represent. But the movie--produced in collaboration by Dre Ice Cube and Tomica Woods-Wright widow of Eazy-E--is tactful to a fault even as it plays up the debauchery of stardom in the gangsta rap era. It simplifies N.W.A.s arc to a gangster-movie knock-off about three friends from way back when who are driven apart by bad influences. These three are E (Jason Mitchell) Dre (Corey Hawkins) and Cube (the actor-rappers son OShea Jackson Jr. doing a good impression of what his father would be like if he had little to no screen presence). Along with perennial second bananas DJ Yella (Neil Brown Jr.) and MC Ren (Aldis Hodge) they lead N.W.A. to unexpected chart success and help turn gangsta rap into a cultural phenomenon. (Severely Jheri-curled founding member Arabian Prince is nowhere to be seen in this version of the story.) Originally bankrolled by Es earnings as a drug dealer they end up being managed by Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti in a bad wig for the ages) which leads to disputes over earnings with Cube splitting for a solo career and Dre eventually decamping to Death Row Records founded by Knight (professional stuntman R. Marcos Taylor effectively creepy) and portrayed as a sadistic hell of Bloods red. Meanwhile actors who look sort of like Chuck D Tupac and Snoop Dogg wander in and out of recording studio sets. Gray directed the video for Ice Cubes seminal ""It Was A Good Day"" and made his feature debut with the Cube-starring Friday so hes certainly qualified for the material. However hes much better at directing scenes of people listening to and enjoying music--the Steadicam gliding alongside a bouncing low rider a staple of the eras MTV makes repeat appearances here--than scenes of them writing and recording it which is a liability in a story driven by diss tracks and multi-platinum hits. It becomes one big blur of isolation booth glass studio monitors and thumbs-up gestures. Every now and then Gray and cinematographer Matthew Libatique pull out an image thats worthy of the music like the doozy of an opening shot which starts with a gun being yanked out from behind a subwoofer. But for the most part the movie has to lean on timeliness for its dramatic weight coming at a moment when the Rodney King beating--the aftermath of which is portrayed here--seems less like history and when ""Fuck Tha Police"" hits harder than it has at any moment since the early 90s. The music remains essential even if the movie isnt.

Straight Outta Compton tells the astonishing story of how these youngsters revolutionized music and pop culture forever. F. Gary Grays biopic of the controversial gangsta rap pioneers is uneven but delivers a powerful compelling message.N.W.A. (from left) MC Ren (Aldis Hodge) DJ Yella (Neil Brown Jr.) Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins) Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell) and Ice Cube (OShea Jackson Jr.).(Photo Universal Pictures)Story HighlightsCritics rating 3.5 stars out of 5The performances are uniformly good.The first half is more compelling than the second.""Straight Outta Compton"" F. Gary Grays biopic of pioneering gangsta rappers N.W.A. manages to feel urgent and alive even as it plays like the coolest episode of VH1s ""Behind the Music"" ever.For a group that provided something so outside the traditional boundaries of what music was offering in the late 1980s and early 90s N.W.A.s struggles rise and inevitable fall are surprisingly familiar. The details are different but the overall structure follows the trajectory of practically every important band youve ever paid attention to.But in the wake of Ferguson Baltimore Charleston and other racially charged incidents and of the Black Lives Matter movement the message from the streets that N.W.A. delivered with its debut album ""Straight Outta Compton"" sounds as meaningful as ever.The film begins in 1986 with Eric ""Eazy-E"" Wright (Jason Mitchell) narrowly avoiding getting busted (or worse) while making a cocaine transaction. Meanwhile Andre ""Dr. Dre"" Young (Corey Hawkins) is trying to launch his career as a DJ. And his friend OShea ""Ice Cube"" Jackson (played by OShea Jackson Jr. Ice Cubes real-life son) chronicles through rhymes the violence and despair in their Los Angeles neighborhood -- Compton drug-infested and gang-ridden with a brutal police force throwing gasoline on the fire not putting it out.RELATEDUnprecedented security in place for Compton premiereDre approaches a receptive Eazy-E about the latter investing some of his drug money into music. They start a label Ruthless Records and Ice Cube comes onboard along with DJ Yella (Neil Brown Jr.) and MC Ren (Aldis Hodge).New York rappers walk out of a session refusing to record Ice Cubes lyrics. Eazy-E so far has footed the bill and avoided taking part but after much urging he steps behind the mike and ... hes awful. He cant keep the beat and his voice is inauthentic. But Dre coaxes a credible reading out of him and off they go recording ""Boyz-n-the-Hood"" line by line.The song becomes a local hit and Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti) appears offering to manage the group and taking Eazy-E under his wing. What follows is the creation of incendiary powerful music that terrified middle America but was in Ice Cubes words ""reality rap."" He considers himself a journalist he says reporting on the world around him.The scenes in which the group members work in the studio are outstanding. Dre is a kind of mad genius coaxing beats from all kinds of sources and inspirations. When they begin recording ""Straight Outta Compton"" he lays down a challenge Only the best rhymes are going to make the cut. This isnt local anymore; hes aiming higher.The music biopic ""Straight Outta Compton"" has a powerful message. (Photo Universal Pictures)The album generates both controversy and sales and soon N.W.A. is touring behind it living the debauched rock-star life of lore (and cliche). Detroit police warn them not to perform their most-controversial song ""F--k tha Police"" or theyll be arrested. Yet the glint in Ice Cubes eye onstage as he calls out to Dre (""Yo Dre I got something to say"") as the beat drops lets you know how seriously they will take the police threats.Success breeds contempt however as Heller obviously favors Eazy-E. Ice Cube wonders why the two of them are eating lobster while everyone else is eating Fatburgers. Hell leave the group and have a huge solo hit with ""AmeriKKKas Most Wanted."" Soon Suge Knight (R. Marcos Taylor) a former bodyguard and ex-con is wresting Dre away. His tactics arent subtle. Theyre dangerous.AZCENTRALStraight Outta Compton (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsIt all gets ugly and personal. The remaining members of N.W.A. blast Ice Cube on record calling him Benedict Arnold. Ice Cube had avoided mentioning them but after hearing the insults he records his most brutal song ""No Vaseline"" in which he trashes everyone including Heller. The scene in which whats left of N.W.A. listens to the song for the first time the realization of what Ice Cube is doing washing over them is one of the best in the movie.The second half of the film is not as compelling as the first -- the creation of the group is more interesting than the standard money problems that will derail it. Women arent treated well when theyre considered at all. And DJ Yella and MC Ren get short shrift in the story (Dre Ice Cube and Eazy-Es widow are among the films producers which may explain that). At almost 21/2 hours the movie is at least 30 minutes too long.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Straight Outta Compton chronicles Dr. Dre Ice Cube and Eazy-Es hard-fought rise to the top in the legendary and controversial hip-hop group N.W.A. But the performances are terrific and when its on its game which is often ""Straight Outta Compton"" is an explosive look at the creation of a message that had to be delivered by the only people who could deliver it a message that is unfortunately as timely now as when we first heard it.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Related links Behind the scenes of Straight Outta Compton By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 1022am on Friday Aug. 14 2015 Friday Aug. 14 2015 Sunday Aug. 16 2015 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram It has been a good year for pop music on film from the Brian Wilson biopic Love and Mercy to the celebration of retro hip-hop Dope. The trend continues with the electric if slightly hagiographic Straight Outta Compton a chronicle of the rise of the controversial and groundbreaking California rap group N.W.A.Los Angeles was a jittery nerve-jangling place in the late 80s and early 90s and not just because of seismic events like the deadly Whittier Narrows and Northridge earthquakes.The fissures between rich and poor black and white the police and the policed erupted into deep fault lines shaking the foundation of the citys image as a sun-kissed paradise. The violence that exploded in the wake of the 1992 not-guilty verdict of the policemen charged with using excessive force on Rodney King would take more than 60 lives.Local music from Guns N Roses snarling Welcome to the Jungle to Sublimes riot-themed April 29 1992 and a wealth of punk rock reflected the changing times. But nowhere was this more true than with hip-hop which may have been born in the shadow of New Yorks skyscrapers but grew into something more raw under the harsh glare of the Hollywood sun. That was in large part due to N.W.A whose ""reality rap"" included such anthemic tracks as Boyz-N-the-Hood and especially [Expletive] tha Police.Director F. Gary Gray ( The Italian Job) does a commendable effort distilling the groups musical life into a story that can appeal to those who know little about N.W.A or the environment from which the members sprang. Its a story of friends -- poet Ice Cube (an excellent OShea Jackson Jr. Ice Cubes son) beat master Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins) former drug dealer and money man Eazy-E (an absolutely riveting and often funny Jason Mitchell) DJ Yella (Neil Brown Jr.) and MC Ren (Aldis Hodge) -- who grow together through music and then apart through success.Its the age-old story of artistic exploitation as manager Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti) gets the guys to aim higher than playing at the local Skateland. Through him they become stars and a media sensation with the album Straight Outta Compton but Hellers not above ripping them off. Hes replaced in their lives by the threatening Suge Knight (R. Marcos Taylor) who wants some of the N.W.A financial action for himself.And its the story of Rodney King-era L.A. where cops sometimes ran roughshod over residents in minority neighborhoods. In one of the films most intense scenes the group members are forced to the ground and taunted by a group of white and black police officers outside a recording studio. Its only due to intervention from Heller whos white that theyre let go. The incident offers context to the groups lyrics that some claimed glorified violence and though it took place more than 20 years ago its reverberations echo loudly with whats happening today.It may seem odd to compare the hard-edged Compton to the more blissful Love and Mercy but the films share more than performances by Giamatti as a music-industry vampire. The two focus much of their time on the act of creation and in both cases its enthralling.In fact the sprawling 157-minute Compton is at its best in its first half when the guys are struggling for their art. Its slightly less successful in portraying the negative fallout from their success only peripherally wrestling with the issues of the rampant sexism (except for the groups mothers most of the women in the film are sexual accessories) or charges of anti-Semitic and anti-Asian lyrical bias that dogged Ice Cube in those days. It telescopes Ice Cubes transition from profane rapper to Are We There Yet?/Friday/21 Jump Street film-comedy king into just a few seconds and only hints at the mogul that Dre -- who last year sold his Beats headphones line to Apple for 3 billion making him one of the worlds richest recording artists -- would become.But as a depiction of a time and place Straight Outta Compton -- from its low-rider Chevys on hydraulics blaring hip-hop to police battering ram vehicles crashing into suspected crack houses -- nails it.Its almost as if you can feel the earth and the culture shaking beneath your feet.

Photo Jaimie Trueblood/Universal Studios MOVIE REVIEW Straight Outta Compton Running time 142 minutes. Rated R (violence sex/nudity profanity drugs). One of the summers most entertaining and provocative movies F. Gary Grays ""Straight Outta Compton provides timely context to one of the most inflammatory songs of the 20th century NWAs 1988 ""F-k Tha Police."" This eye-opening and ambitiously scaled docudrama traces the rise of gangsta rap pioneers NWA (N-gaz Wit Attitudes) from its 1986 founding in Compton a city in southern Los Angeles County where as we see Daryl Gates LAPD routinely brutalized and humiliated African-American youths without provocation. Drug dealer Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell) who ran a record label recruited teenage Ice Cube (played by the rappers son OShea Jackson Jr.) Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins) DJ Yella (Neil Brown Jr.) and MC Ren (Aldis Hodge) to channel their anger into hip-hop protest songs. But they were quickly signed by veteran rock manager Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti) who got them a major label contract. Neil Brown Jr. Jason Mitchell OShea Jackson Jr. Aldis Hodge and Corey Hawkins.Photo Jaimie Trueblood/Universal Studios Controversy exploded with NWAs debut album""Straight Outta Compton."" The films most compelling sequence shows NWA defying Detroit police officials who threaten to arrest them if they perform ""F-k Tha Police"" at a sold-out concert -- and the melee that follows. NWAs role as unlikely First Amendment crusaders is more interesting than the contract disputes that follow as Cube who wrote half the lyrics on ""Compton and then Dre break with the group and go on to wildly successful solo careers. Dre co-founds Death Row Records with ex-bodyguard-turned-rap mogul Suge Knight (played by a truly scary R. Marcos Taylor) but their highly volatile relationship doesnt end well. (In real life Knight is behind bars awaiting trial on vehicular homicide charges following an early screening of ""Straight Outta Compton."") For a film whose producers include Cube and Dre its surprisingly candid in its depiction of the groups misogyny though Dres 91 assault on rapper/interviewer Denise ""Dee"" Barnes -- he pleaded no contest -- isnt mentioned. But theres plenty to admire about ""Straight Outta Compton"" including its lively evocation of a time and place pointed direction by longtime Cube collaborator Gray rousingly staged performances and uniformly excellent acting. Newcomer Mitchell is especially good as the tragically promiscuous Eazy-E who was celebrated as a key voice of his generation when he died in 1995 of AIDS-related causes.

Jim Farber NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday August 12 2015 836 AM facebook Tweet email ""Straight Outta Compton"" focuses not just on a musical group but the environment from which it came. (Jaimie Trueblood) Jim Farber NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday August 12 2015 836 AM Title STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON Film Info With OShea Jackson Jr. Corey Hawkins Biodrama about the legendary hip-hop group N.W.A. Director F. Gary Gray (147). R. Violence language sexuality. Area theaters. ""STRAIGHT OUTTA Compton"" goes right to the heart of what made N.W.A. one of the most defiant groups of all time. The movie opens with a burst of heated quotes from 1980s news anchors talking about President Reagans ""war on drugs."" Overnight that campaign turned into a war on anyone who happened to come from a ghetto -- like Compton where the members of the rap group lived. In F. Gary Grays nuanced film we see the habitual harassment of young black men by the police as well as out-of-control black-on-black gang violence. Thats central to what inspired the members of N.W.A. to both report on their world and react creatively against it. The groups experience helped birth gangsta rap. It was epitomized by anthems of insurrection like ""F--k Tha Police"" a piece so pure and deep that it resonated with millions who had never set foot in the inner city. The creation and recording of that song forms one of the films most electrifying scenes. It helps that the actors playing the core members capture their demeanor attitude and look with an accuracy that stops just short of mimicry. One performer had help from his genes. OShea Jackson Jr. plays his dad the rapper Ice Cube. (L. to r.) MC Ren (Aldis Hodge) DJ Yella (Neil Brown Jr.) Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell) Ice Cube (OShea Jackson Jr.) and Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins) in ""Straight Outta Compton."" (Jaimie Trueblood/Universal Pictures) No movie could capture all the alarming incidents and contradictions that make up the complete N.W.A. story. But in order to stress the groups most righteous side the movie downplays their youthful excesses as well as their flagrant sexism. ""Straight Outta Compton"" leaves out for instance an infamous incident in which Dr. Dre threw a woman he disagreed with down a flight of stairs. Also given short shrift MC Ren the groups third rapper. Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio tweeted ""Hey TeamMarco clear two hours on my schedule on Aug 14. Gotta see StraightOuttaCompton."" (marcorubio/via Twitter) Its more even-handed in treating the bands manager Jerry Heller (played with a wily smarm by Paul Giamatti). The film shows how Heller provided a crucial boost to the group while also playing tricks with their finances. ""Compton"" has more on its mind than music. It touches on themes of ingrained poverty and pathology the contrast between official justice and the street kind as well as the importance of black entrepreneurship. What starts in the streets ends in the boardrooms ultimately making ""Compton"" a major story of America. ON A MOBILE DEVICE? WATCH THE VIDEO HERE.

Its not so much a music biopic as a loud bass-thumping explosion for the senses -- one that seems especially relevant at a time when the relationship between police and young African-American men has perhaps never been scrutinized so closely. Some may find it a rallying cry while others may see it as a history lesson. Still others likely will find it a self-indulgent one-sided look at music and racial history -- after all it is co-produced by N.W.A. co-founders Dr. Dre and Ice Cube.

Gary Grays effort to bring an important story to the big screen is aided by surprisingly good acting from a largely inexperienced cast a story that moves well (though the last 30-40 minutes have a lot of plot jammed in) news clips from the time (some of which seem laughable now) and incredible music speaking loudly for itself.That must have been the easy part for Gray just turning up the volume and letting N.W.A.s lyrics and powerful beats take control. ""Straight Outta Compton"" is like a cross between watching a docudrama -- think a longer VH1 ""Behind the Music"" segment on steroids -- and standing right in front of the speakers at an N.W.A. show during the bands prime. Advertisement The story is told through the eyes of the groups three best-known members Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell) Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins) and Ice Cube (Ice Cubes son OShea Jackson Jr. who proves without a doubt that he merited the part). Along with MC Ren (Aldis Hodge) and DJ Yella (Neil Brown Jr.) the group comes together in the South Central Los Angeles community of Compton making music in local clubs and in a garage studio.Eazy-E initially was the money man a local drug dealer with business savvy who financed the first record before getting recruited into the group despite having little rap skill (one of the movies funniest scenes is Dre trying to teach the squeaky-voiced E about cadence and downbeats). The group gets noticed by Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti) a semi-known music manager who wants back in the game. He and E become the business core of N.W.A. as it cuts new ground as a group rapping about ""reality"" -- drugs women police -- to beats as thunderous as heavy metal guitar riffs.Hellers relationship to the musicians was complicated which is how the movie treats it. Giamatti sells it well as a middle-aged Jewish man trying to help a group he cares about but also sees as his meal ticket. One of the films pivotal scenes involves Heller nearly coming to blows with police harassing the group outside a recording studio an incident that prompts Ice Cube to write ""(Expletive) tha Police.""The song becomes a flash point with the media conservative America and most significantly law enforcement turning N.W.A. into a group of outlaw-heroes in the eyes of its fans. If the films portrayal of police harassing the rappers are accurate ""Compton"" does a fantastic job of showing how a group like N.W.A. came to be in the years just before the Rodney King beating. The scene with Detroit police trying to shut down an N.W.A. concert when they perform ""(Expletive) tha Police"" prompting a mini-riot is as much a dramatic political statement as it is a retelling of history.Along the way Cube begins questioning the bands money trail eventually leaving N.W.A. and going solo resulting in some drama with bandmates and some necessary humor. Eventually Dre also has financial misgivings and leaves to form Death Row Records with the unsavory Suge Knight (a menacing R. Marcos Taylor) a story that could get its own feature-length film.Heres what the 21/2-hour movie has working against it In trying to cover a dozen years of complicated history some of the most compelling real-life aspects feel hurried or skimmed over. I wasnt sure if the Dr. Dre character was given short shrift by the script or whether he just wasnt portrayed as well by Hawkins as some of the other characters. Mitchell is excellent as Eazy-E and Jackson Jr. is eerily effective playing his father. Meanwhile DJ Yella and MC Ren are shown as afterthoughts and there were no strong female roles in the movie though it could be argued that raps early years offered few opportunities for women.But the sheer force of ""Straight Outta Compton"" steamrolls its flaws. Director Gray who is from Compton and made a name for himself directing some of hip-hops best music videos has given us a movie that feels honest and urgent. Yes ""Compton"" is told from the point of view of those who come out looking the best in the end. But even if it is a somewhat one-sided story it is still a vital one thats well-told.""Straight Outta Compton"" should end up as a definitive history of an important time in music.Contact Tony Hicks at Facebook.com/BayAreaNewsGroup.TonyHicks or Twitter.com/tonyhicks67.Straight outta Compton    1/2Rating R (for language throughout strong sexuality/nudity violence and drug use)Cast OShea Jackson Jr. Jason Mitchell Corey Hawkins Paul Giamatti Aldis Hodge Neil Brown Jr. R.

N.W.As biopic Straight Outta Compton blurs those roles. Both Dre and Cube produced the film and they seem to have edited the script with a red pen. The surviving rappers have smudged everything that might make them look like creeps or chumps beveling so many rough edges that their screen selves become blank slates. Theyre bland good guys -- geniuses really -- distinguishable mainly by which sports logo each wears on his hat. Ironically its left to Eazy-E the deceased member who cant sue to give their story life.As Eazy-E newcomer Jason Mitchell is introduced with the moon backlighting his Jheri curl before he sprints away from the cops. His Eazy screws people and gets screwed over. He swaggers and threatens cowers and makes destructive choices imbuing the film with his deluded squeaky-voiced soul. By contrast when Cube (Ice Cubes oldest son OShea Jackson Jr. who is excellent) smashes up a record execs (Tate Ellington) office for skimping on his royalties the scene frames him as a hood hero triumphing over The Man. As for Dre (Corey Hawkins) beating TV host Dee Barnes so brutally that she filed a 22.75 million lawsuit thats not here at all. Dre does allow in his 1994 arrest for drunk driving but rewinds that night back to the studio to pin his behavior on Suge Knight (R. Marcos Taylor) riling him up. And we definitely dont see Dre serving any of his 1995 jail sentence -- an odd omission in a docudrama thats often about street cred.Film Details Straight Outta Compton RatingR GenreDrama Running Time147 min. More Info Trailer ""Yall always fucking with me"" Dre groans to the arresting officers. That line should be Straight Outta Comptons sharpest theme but in the moment it sputters out like a flat tire. Dre was after all leading the cops on a 90 mph chase through Beverly Hills. Its a misstep because in any other moment in the movie hed be right. Director F. Gary Gray edits the LAPD into the film as if theyre Jason in a Friday the 13th movie always lurking Their cars roll past in the background their sirens wail unseen their officers tackle the group again and again just for being in the ""wrong"" place i.e. in front of their recording studio or on the sidewalk outside a friends house.Related StoriesTairrie B Hip-Hops Original Bad Bitch Is BackAn N.W.A movie could have come out anytime in the last two decades. Biggie Smalls got his six years ago; Eminem made his three years after his first hit. But were here in the theater today because a generation after N.W.A shouted ""Fuck tha police"" neighborhoods across America -- in Ferguson Cleveland Staten Island McKinney Texas and Baltimore -- still ache to hear it. Ice Cubes blast at cops who ""think they have the authority to kill a minority"" echoes. If anything its gotten louder.The on-screen confrontations with the LAPD build to the Rodney King beating which we see the stars watching. Eazy is outraged by the footage. Nods DJ Yella (Neil Brown Jr.) ""At least we got those muthafuckas on video."" At least King lived. How grim is it to watch this scene in 2015 and admit that long after N.W.As brave feud with the FBI things have actually gotten worse? Now we have even more cameras -- yet the victims so often are dead. Meanwhile in last years Ride Along Ice Cube played a cop who fires guns at unarmed civilians falsely accuses a kid of assaulting a police officer and brags that his Wi-Fi password is ""SuspectShot23.""Gray doesnt fulfill Straight Outta Comptons political potential. (Or perhaps his producers steered him in a different direction.) Halfway through he seems to decide that what audiences really want to see in an N.W.A biopic is label contract disputes. The second chunk is a grind wherein Cube and then Dre peel away from Jerry Hellers (Paul Giamatti) Ruthless Records team up with new business partners and then leave them too. In a 150-minute film thats a lot of paperwork.Its clear what producers Cube and Dre are most interested in the money. Story is secondary especially when the facts are embarrassing. Straight Outta Compton deletes what could have been its best scenes -- say how Knight dangled Vanilla Ice over a balcony so he and Dre could fund Death Row Records with the profits from ""Ice Ice Baby"" the antithesis of gangsta rap.Knights slow emergence as a power-hungry player is great. He allows himself to get brushed off as a big lug until the guys realize he can hit back -- hard. A back-and-forth rundown of Ice Cube Eazy and Dres three-way diss-track feud is fun even if it cuts out the ""Dre Day"" video in which a character called ""Sleazy-E"" does the Roger Rabbit while clutching a cardboard sign reading ""Will Rap for Food."" (And it definitely doesnt have Eazys counter-punch ""Real Muthaphuckkin Gs"" where the rapper bashed Sleazy to death with a bat.) Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat.

Entertainment ""Straight Outta Compton"" Is Everything Thats Wrong And Right With Self-Mythologizing The vibrant N.W.A biopic is great but could really do with some distance. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Aldis Hodge Neil Brown Jr. Jason Mitchell OShea Jackson Jr. and Corey Hawkins in Straight Outta Compton. Universal Pictures ID 6589263 Vibrant rambunctious and as lopsided as a cake taken out of the oven too soon Straight Outta Compton lays out the epic story of N.W.A the groundbreaking rap group that pioneered the incendiary sound of an era and birthed the solo careers of hip-hop giants Dr. Dre and Ice Cube. And also others for sure but Dre and Cube deserve first mention in this context because theyre not just two of the movies subjects theyre two of its producers. They helped shepherd it into existence and into the hands of director F. Gary Gray (whos worked with both previously in Set It Off and Friday) and writers Jonathan Herman and Andrea Berloff.Music biopics usually wait until their subjects are deceased before turning their lives into the stuff of movies but Straight Outta Compton which starts in 1986 and continues through to 1995 forges boldly ahead with events that still come across as recent and raw. Most of its subjects are still around (and a few are complaining). The movie feels very much like the story of N.W.A as enabled by Dre and Cube who got the prerogative of shaping what kind of tale gets told.This happens with every true story turned scripted movie but history rarely feels as messily corralled as it does in the latter half of this one which focuses on feuds and fights more than making hit records. The rise and fall of the group doesnt fit easily into the standard music movie mold but Straight Outta Compton tries to stuff its complicated triumphant-tragic elements into one anyway shuffling away or diminishing some inconvenient parts of its main characters pasts and designating a few villains. View this image > OShea Jackson Jr. Universal Pictures ID 6589297 But before all that when Straight Outta Compton and its young not-yet-famous men are just getting started its about as thrilling as movies like this get. Its electric -- part getting-the-team-together part lets-put-on-a-show except the players are baby versions of iconic hip-hop artists scrapping together revolutionary tracks using lyrics they wrote on the school bus and trying them out during a DJ gig for which they were instructed to play nice and get people thinking of ""pussy not pistols.""The cast is made up of many newcomers apparently chosen more for their resemblances to their famous counterparts than their existing work but they acquit themselves just fine either way. Jason Mitchell is Eazy-E Corey Hawkins is Dr. Dre Neil Brown Jr. is DJ Yella Leverages Aldis Hodge is MC Ren and Ice Cube is played by his spitting-image son OShea Jackson Jr. a standout in his first acting role. Theyre still kids at the start really except for Eazy-E who opens the movie with a tense drug deal gone wrong that feels spliced in from one of Grays action flicks A police battering ram comes through the door and Eazy flees across a neighboring rooftop.Eazy-E is for better and worse set up as Straight Outta Comptons tragic hero putting up drug money to get N.W.A and Ruthless Records going causing the groups breakup due to his loyalty to manager Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti) and dying of AIDS at the terribly young age of 31. The movie starts and ends with him and hes its primary source of conflict even if Jerry bears the actual blame. (Heller whos written his own extravagant take on the era starts off portrayed with some nuance but is gradually whittled down into an evil record exec cliche the big bad until Suge Knight played by a glowering R. Marcos Taylor shows up halfway through.) View this image > Jason Mitchell. Universal Pictures ID 6589302 Eazy is allowed to be flawed in ways Cube and Dre arent as they grow and recede into their respective successes -- he brings the authenticity if not the natural musical talent as evidenced by the movies best scene when he takes to the studio to record ""Boyz-n-the-Hood."" It wasnt the plan. Ice Cubes lyrics get rejected by the group initially slated to record and Dr. Dre coaxes Eazy-E into the booth while that backing track plays getting him to let loose with the familiar line ""Cruisin down the street in my six-fo."" The rhythmlessness with which he first does it is all the funnier for how little it matches seared-in memories of the song and the way hes coached into his famous delivery is a goosebump moment.There are actually goosebump moments whenever Straight Outta Compton is in the studio. Or onstage -- cinematographer Matthew Libatique a frequent Darren Aronofsky collaborator throws his agile camera onstage and down in the crowd looking up and toggles between the two to give the experience of watching such explosive performers and being them. It captures the feeling of N.W.A just blowing the roof off a joint during their first gig at Skateland U.S.A. and into their national tour living large on the road and dealing with threatening letters from the FBI in response to ""Fuck tha Police.""The anger and outrage of that song and so much of N.W.As output gets connected directly to the experiences its characters endure growing up and living as black men during the height of the ""war on drugs"" -- from the opening raid forward any scene involving the police looks like a scene from exactly that a warzone. The shot seen more than once of Jackson or Hawkins incensed faces put against the hood of a car or the sidewalk while being patted down or cuffed for doing nothing places the movie in a continuum of police violence through today long before the films chronology arrives at Rodney King. When Ice Cube spits ""Yo Dre I got something to say"" onstage in Detroit in the face of cops whove forbidden the song into which hes about to launch its righteous even as we know retaliation is coming. View this image > Corey Hawkins Universal Pictures ID 6589309 The movie loses most of its momentum after Ice Cube breaks off from the group and everyone starts turning their anger against each other though it still has moments -- like the scene in which the targets of Cubes 1991 diss track ""No Vaseline"" listen in a Los Angeles mansion while he systematically destroys them. But Straight Outta Compton basically spends its second half in search of an ending sketching out the decline of Ruthless and the formation of Death Row Records and trotting out the equivalent of cameos of other rappers -- Keith Stanfield as Snoop Dogg and Marcc Rose as Tupac. Women throughout the movie are decoratively interchangeable or theyre scolds until the men meet the ones theyre going to marry. Dres history of violence against women isnt hinted at and his relationship with fellow recording artist Michelle whos been open in alleging abuse is largely elided. Cube dismisses accusations of anti-Semitism with one brief scene. By the final reconciliation which has Eazy-E waiting for his old compatriots in the studio like a kid holding out for his estranged dad to finally come over for a game of catch the movies manipulations feel unignorable.We look for self-mythologizing in movie biographies. Even in warts-and-all portraits we want testaments to greatness proof of why someone merits their own movie. Theres no question N.W.A deserves big-screen treatment and until Straight Outta Compton tilts into the self-serving -- over the credits were even reminded of how many billion dollars Apple paid for Beats by Dre -- its the best kind of sensational. The hip-hop biopic is still so young and due to grow (wheres that Tupac movie?) and come into its own and Straight Outta Compton shows both how good this subgenre can be and the benefits of distance.

A group so deliberately controversial that its unprintable name was presented as an acronym and the title of its biggest hit had to be partially rendered in dashes N.W.A. was born in the ravaged neighborhoods of 80s Los Angeles. Its members sang about using drugs and using women. They sang about poverty and racism. They sang about getting hassled by the cops whenever they walked down the street. People called it ""gangsta rap."" N.W.A. called it ""reality rap."" The movie of their story though isnt nearly as controversial - probably because this is the authorized version with core members Dr. Dre and Ice Cube also serving as producers. Theres still some meanness and menace. But the film never has as much attitude as they did. It does have some very good performances though courtesy of its three stars - OShea Jackson Jr. as Ice Cube Corey Hawkins as Dr. Dre and Jason Mitchell as Eazy-E. Both Jackson and Hawkins have some physical advantages - the first is the real Cubes look-alike kid while Hawkins has the same cold almond-eyes as Dre. But Mitchell is even better in a role which has a sense of humor danger and a mountain range of highs and lows. Less effective is Paul Giamatti playing that ugly cliche of music-biz stories the shifty Jewish manager. Giamatti tries very hard to give the man some humanity but a series of increasingly awful hairpieces - are they supposed to be that bad? - do him in as does the script. Because - here comes that authorization problem - it wants our heroes to be controversial but not unsympathetic. So the very real charges of anti-Semitism against Ice Cube (he was aligned with the Nation of Islam for awhile -- as Eazy-E bizarrely was being protected by the Jewish Defense League) are dismissed as a simple gotcha question from a slimy journalist. Charges that the music glamorizes crime and violence are laughed off. True Suge Knights own criminality is dwelled on - hes the real villain in this telling -- but Dr. Dres vicious attack on a female journalist is ignored. Scenes that need to be standouts - stadium concerts the Rodney King riots - are dully staged. And the movie itself - unsurprisingly produced directed written by and starring men - implicitly endorses the old rap-video misogyny of women as screaming bitches or jiggling hos particularly in orgiastic scenes that make Vinnie Chases pool parties look like Easter Sunday breakfasts with Trappist monks. Theres a grittier grimier story in here but it needed a different script and probably a different director than the uncritical F. Gary Gray whose resume is studded with old-school rap videos and Ice Cube projects. (John Singleton the original choice would have been perfect; Spike Lee would have been fascinating.) Because ""Straight Outta Compton"" should be about more than a bunch of poor kids hitting it big. Because its really about musicians writing and singing about the ugly things they see. And its also about escaping that ugliness but sometimes still internalizing those mean-street values - even when some of them are cruel ones like misogyny and violence and the stereotyping of other people.And thats something that really needs to be heard.

Gary Gray; Producer (person) Ice Cube Dr. Dre; Release Date Wide 08/14/2015 Posted August 5 2015 -- 625 PM EDT See also Director talks about Dr. Dre on the set of Straight Outta Compton How Ice Cubes son really got his breakout role in Straight Outta Compton When it first came out back in the summer of 1988 N.W.As debut album Straight Outta Compton sounded like a harrowing distress call from the streets of South Central Los Angeles. It was urgent angry and alive in a way that West Coast hip-hop hadnt yet dared to be. In the albums rat-a-tat opening lines Ice Cube delivers a blistering salvo of pent-up frustration from the ""gang called Niggaz With Attitude."" The rappers choice of words wasnt arbitrary. NWA was a gang. Maybe not in the traditional sense but they were a tight-knit brotherhood forged through their collective experiences with poverty prejudice and police harassment. Even when you left you were never really out. What would happen to N.W.A over the next decade (the bitter infighting solo careers rivalries riches and the death of Eric ""Eazy-E"" Wright from AIDS in 1995) is enough to fuel a dozen Behind the Music episodes. And at times F. Gary Grays fast furious and funny N.W.A biopic feels exactly like that fast-forwarding through the groups highlights and lowlights without getting too deep beneath the surface. But what a surface it is. There are moments in Straight Outta Compton when the music is so thrilling and fierce its enough to give you goose bumps - like a scene near the mid-way point of the film when OShea Jackson Jr. (playing his real-life father Ice Cube) scowls and spits the retaliation rap ""No Vaseline"" after being called out as a Benedict Arnold for leaving N.W.A. Grays film has just enough moments like that one that if youre like me youll forgive its more melodramatic cliches and just surrender to its raw brass-knuckle force. Straight Outta Compton opens in 1986. For those too young to recall that era Gray uses archival footage and news reports to sketch out that this is the height of the crack epidemic and L.A.s Bloods-and-Crips turf wars. Eric ""Eazy-E"" Wright (played by Jason Mitchell) the ""hardest"" of the teens who will become N.W.A is swept up in that lethal lifestyle. When we first meet him he narrowly escapes being killed in a guns-drawn dispute at a dope house thats raided by the LAPD - maybe the only time in his short tragic life that a brush with the cops will bounce in his favor. Meanwhile Andre ""Dr. Dre"" Young (Corey Hawkins) is hustling to get his DJ career off of the ground while his pal Ice Cube is busy observing the brutal world around him a rapper/reporter penning rhymes in a journal. Soon along with DJ Yella (Neil Brown Jr.) and MC Ren (Aldis Hodge) they will come together in the studio and channel their surroundings into a Molotov cocktail captured on vinyl. The first - and best - third of the film is essentially N.W.As origin story their aspirations assembly and earliest recordings that lead them to put their faith in a seemingly paternal manager (Paul Giamatti with a shock of grey hair and a series of velour track suits) who ultimately chisels everyone but Eazy-E out of their share of money and credit (eventually hell cheat him too). As NWA goes on tour to promote Straight Outta Compton playing to packed houses partying with a parade of naked groupies and becoming the outlaw provocateurs of Gangsta Rap Grays film gathers force hinting at the beefs and betrayals to come. First theres the looming hulking presence of Suge Knight (R. Marcus Taylor) an ex-con ex-bodyguard who whispers arsenic into Dres ear. Then theres Eazy-Es power-hungry paranoia and health problems which Gray telegraphs with jackhammer-subtle coughing fits - the kind of narrative laziness that ultimately prevents Compton from being great. Written by Andrea Berloff and Jonathan Herman Compton is the kind of movie that can sweep you up in its thrall one moment and then leave you scratching your head the next. Its hugely entertaining and occasionally maddening. In a scene that manages to be one of the films most powerful and phoniest the group is shown hanging out in front of the studio taking a break from recording their first album when a squad car pulls up and proceeds to humiliate and harass them because they look like gangbangers. The sequence has an eerie and revolting timeliness as specific to 2015 as it is to 1988. But before its allowed to sink in and resonate Gray cuts to Ice Cube behind the mic rapping his response to the incident ""F-- Tha Police."" Surely the cause-and-effect couldnt have happened that quickly. Its a cheat. But Gray has a lot of story to pack into two hours and change and the clock is ticking ... When Cube eventually leaves the group feeling shortchanged and disrespected the actors (who are uniformly excellent) make you feel the pain of the divorce. They give you the sense of how fast their world is moving and how hard it is to get off the ride. Soon Dre jumps too fatefully hitching his wagon for a time with Knight whos painted as a sort of Thug-life Caligula with his penchant for terrorizing rivals with his Dobermans when hes not using the blunt business end of the gun stuffed in his sizable waistband. For him violence isnt just something in N.W.As lyrics its a way of life. Not for nothing did he name his and Dres company ""Death Row."" In its final stretch Compton skitters from one momentous milestone in the history of hip-hop to the next Heres Dre writing The Chronic with his laid-back new protege Snoop Dogg; heres Cube writing the script for Friday; heres Eazy-E smoking too much weed while his crooked manager scams him; here they all are watching the riots after the Rodney King verdict. Gray does his best to keep the momentum going while jumping back and forth between storylines but with so much ground to cover he lets certain threads slip from his grasp. At one point Dre leads the police on a high-speed car chase gets arrested and its never mentioned again. Its a tribute to how compelling N.W.As story is that you almost dont care about narrative lapses like that. Straight Outta Compton is a hugely entertaining film that works best if you dont look at it too closely and just listen.

Biopic Straight Outta Compton Drops The Beat ""These are not bangers these are artists"" might as well be the official tagline of F. Gary Grays N.W.A biopic ""Straight Outta Compton"" (named after the rap super-groups first album). Instead the line is tossed off by Paul Giamatti (starring as the groups manager Jerry Heller) during an altercation with the police one that almost immediately leads to the penning of the groups seminal song ""Fuck Tha Police"" an on-the-nose assertion that only hints at the rough -- and gratingly obvious -- road to come. And yet Grays film starts strong introducing a wide cast of players in illuminating and energetic ways. Eric ""Eazy-E"" Wright (Jason Mitchell) kicks off the action -- appropriately enough given his legacy as the groups leader -- with an ill-advised visit to a local flophouse eager to extract money owed to him by insolvent dealers. Eazys drop-by is interrupted by the police gung ho on the War on Drugs in ways that are both funny and genuinely upsetting (the film is rife with humor and there are many -- wholly intentional -- laughs to be had here a nice shot of levity into a complicated and occasionally heavy story). Elsewhere Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins) whiles away the time listening to a wide selection of records and working on his DJing while OShea Jackson Jr. spends his off-hours penning fresh lyrics and observing the world around him. The screenplays treatment of the groups initial start is surprisingly low-key with the guys just sort of getting together to make some music just sort of getting the money to put out a record just sort of grabbing a manager and major fame in the process. As N.W.A manager Jerry Heller Giamatti exemplifies the the fraught nature of the music industry but he also delivers some of the films most clearly telegraphed storylines. Heres Jerry delivering Eazys contract and no one elses heres Jerry indulging in a fancy meal with Eazy while everyone else makes do with fast food heres Jerry looking on uncomfortably as Suge Knight (R. Marcus Taylor) begins to horn in on Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins bringing something approaching grace to the role). That N.W.A. breaks up because of fights over contracts and money and credit isnt a shock but that most of the blame is foisted on interloper Jerry is a bit one-note. The films first half is dedicated to N.W.As early years complete with performances that so ably imitate N.W.A shows that its almost jarring purposely rangy montages that focus on the groups creative process and a number of sequences that make clear that N.W.As reputation of hellraisers wasnt incorrect though it may have been misunderstood by outsiders. The specter of the police looms large over most of ""Straight Outta Compton"" from those opening scenes with Eazy to an altercation between a truly innocent Ice Cube and some power-mad cops to a longer sequence that dramatizes a riot in Detroit thats spawned by the local forces determination to shut down an N.W.A show and the effect is eerily timely. The films second half is rife with references to the Rodney King beating and subsequent trial and if N.W.A neophytes come away from the film with anything it will likely be a hearty respect for the prescience of the groups origin story. The films performances are remarkably solid most of which -- especially that of Jackson funnily enough -- neatly walk the line between impression and impersonation. Casting Jackson as his own father was a canny move on the part of the production but its one that pays off in spades; if theres a breakout star in ""Straight Outta Compton"" its unquestionably Jackson (Ice Cube fans might be tempted to say the same of N.W.A but thats an argument for another time). Despite a full throttle first half a smartly entertaining and remarkably straight-forward hour and change ""Straight Outta Compton"" is unable to avoid some of the traditional traps that plague biopics. Theres no satisfying way to make a truly N.W.A-centric film simply because if you make a film about N.W.As success you have to end it with the group breaking up and engaging in a cold war of barbed rap lyrics. Instead the film takes a wider view following Eazy-E Dr. Dre and Ice Cube as they all embark on individual endeavors with varied levels of success. ""Straight Outta Compton"" compresses time sacrificing story in the process. Its not likely that Tupac Shakur (Marcc Rose) first started laying down lyrics to ""California Love"" while Dre screamed at a badly behaving Knight in the next room but the film still forces such scenes on its audience. An older Ice Cube probably didnt watch the ""Straight Outta Compton"" music video alongside his wife and children mere days before Eazy E finally reached out to him about a reunion but thats there too. Its biopic syndrome this impulse to condense events to hit the high notes to provide fans with recognizable stories to essentially act as a greatest hits album and it sinks the second half of an otherwise compelling funny and extremely entertaining film with a beat all its own.

Early obscurity and effort-laden struggle become mainstream success; controversy becomes publicity; too much happens too soon. Directed by F. Gary Gray (whose connection to N.W.A. founding member Ice Cube goes back to some of Grays earliest work as a video and feature director) the film has a sprawling 150-minute running time and while the energy may flag in the films back half it never lacks for something to say or to show us. Opening in 1986 in the South Central L.A. neighborhood that gives the film -- and one of N.W.A.s first singles -- its name Eric Wright (Jason Mitchell) -- later to be known as Eazy-E -- pops the trunk of his car wrestles a speaker out of its cabinet and takes a gun and cocaine from under it to go sell some product. He knows theres no long-term future in moving those goods and Eric soon begins to wonder if the bravery and hustle he brings to slinging drugs could be applied to other endeavors. Also Read Straight Outta Compton Trailer Ice Cube Dr. Dre and Eazy-E Rap to Reflect Reality (Video) We first see Erics friend Andre Young (Corey Hawkins) lying atop a spread of Parliament Zapp Band and James Brown albums.  A talented DJ Andre -- later to become famous as Dr. Dre -- spins at a club with Antoine Carraby (Neil Brown Jr.) who also goes by DJ Yella; Lorenzo Patterson (Aldis Hodge) aka MC Ren is another friend. Meanwhile OShea Jackson who raps under the name Ice Cube writes verses for his friends to put over Dre and Yellas beats even while hes ostensibly working with another crew. (Taking the role of the lyrical gangsta is Cubes actual son OShea Jackson Jr. who has his fathers sly smile and expressive eyes.) Dre convinces Eric to put some of his drug-trade money into starting a record label; Eric turns out to be a natural behind the mic. The five come together like fingers forming a fist. They make what they call ""Reality Rap"" -- a mix of journalism from the mean streets crime fiction and cautionary tales -- that soon becomes the sound of the city bumped from every car by listeners captivated by Ice Cubes writing Dres production and Eazys natural flair for tales of trouble. Video Ice Cube Explains Four Things N.W.A. Does Not Stand For History as they say is written by the winners and musical biopics tend to be written or at least produced by the songwriters and the survivors. Dr. Dre is one of the many producers here as is Ice Cube and the film puts many of the groups early legal and financial troubles squarely on the shoulders of Eazy-E. Wright died of AIDS in 1995 and various nefarious goings-on are laid on him and on manager Jerry Heller played by Paul Giamatti as an old-school music-business type who loves to see his acts shoot up the charts even as hes trying to sneak bad contracts past them. Gray and cinematographer Matthew Libatique (""Black Swan"") have crafted a vibrant glowingly handsome film even when its focusing a bit too hard on the factual and temporal milestones of the bands later career in its third act. Libatique captures both subtle glances between troubled collaborators through the glass of the close-quarters recording studio and the sprawling excess and crushed mass of huge bacchanalian parties and crowded concert scenes. Also Read Ice Cube Gives a Shout Out for Bringing Friday Back (Video) There are a few bravura moments of direction -- a gliding Steadicam shot through a post-show hotel-suite party is both glamorous and seedy -- but Gray also keeps the story moving without calling too much attention to his own presence. The script by Andrea Berloff and Jonathan Herman (from a story by Alan Wenkus and S. Lee Savidge) goes beyond the groups formation and later implosion to show us events like the arrival of menacing bodyguard-turned-record-executive-turned-criminal Suge Knight (R. Marcos Taylor) as well as Dres proteges Snoop Dogg (Keith Stanfield of ""Short Term 12"" nailing the rappers sinuous lazy drawl) and Tupac (Marcc Rose); at times ""Straight Outta Compton"" feels less like a conventional making-of-a-band film and more like a slightly oversized history of hip-hop since 1986. The film shows the context and commerce of the groups notoriety never shying away from the casual racism of the 80s-era LAPD. As the Rodney King beating trial verdict and riots bloom and burn all around the group as a major part of the film real-life news footage of concerned anchors fretting about ""Gangsta Rap"" enters the mix. But the film makes no bones about the fact that Compton was a place where it was easier to find a gun than a job and as Eazy-E responds to a pointed question about whether their music causes violence in the hood ""Compton has AK-47s from Russia and cocaine from Columbia and aint none of us got passports; look to the source."" Also Read 11 Best Lines From Ice Cubes Friday in Honor of Movies 20th Anniversary (Video) The performances are uniformly strong with some standouts. Jacksons startling resemblance to his father shouldnt obscure his very real thespian heavy lifting while Mitchell reveals the mix of ambition and insecurity in Eazy-E not to mention his real remorse about what happened to his friends as money and misunderstanding tore them apart. Corey Hawkins as the man who would become Dr. Dre manages to capture the arc of an artist who went from sleeping on friends couches to running some of the most lucrative -- and influential -- record labels of our time; its quiet work but it shines with truth. N.W.A.s actual music might as well be another cast member and the groups singles -- shocking then still powerful now -- are presented as the product of work skill and will even as they pulse and spring from the speakers with hiss-tick treble and booming omnipotent bass. The film doesnt have much use for its female characters -- theyre either gyrating party-goers supportive girlfriends or gyrating party-goers who become supportive girlfriends -- and the movies focus on Dre Eazy and Cube (plus Heller) gives short shrift to the very real contributions of DJ Yella and MC Ren as well as to the actors playing them. Also Read Ice Cube on Suge Knights Murder Rap I Hope You Get Out the Situation Youre In (Video) Underneath the gunshots and the battle raps ""Straight Outta Compton"" is a fairly conventional movie about a music group somewhere between hero-making and the honest truth. Even with the films mild flaws and arms-wide-open approach it tells a powerful engaging and compelling story of how America challenged and changed five young black men and how they in turn challenged and changed America.

Daily Edition Login to download Straight Outta Compton Film Review 900 AM PDT 7/31/2015 by John DeFore FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS An entertaining if limited biopic TWITTER Ice Cube and Dr. Dre enlist F. Gary Gray to tell the story of seminal rap group. Biopics about bands consisting of equals are far rarer than those about solo artists and for good reason Try doing justice to even three performers rise from obscurity to fame especially if they then veer in different directions and you hardly have time to develop the stars as human characters. So Straight Outta Compton about the fractious career of gangsta-rap doorbusters N.W.A. turns into a bio-epic running well over two hours without even mentioning the competing strands of hip-hop (from Public Enemys righteous anger to the feel-good vibes of De La Soul) that by contrast made N.W.A.s furious sound so upsetting to so many people. Produced by former N.W.A. members Ice Cube and Dr. Dre (among others) and directed by F. Gary Gray who started his career with an Ice Cube video and went on to direct his comic outing Friday the result is a self-portrait that predictably softens the edges of careers that generated even more controversy than we see here. But if the movie pushes most of the ugliest behavior off onto side players (like the notorious Suge Knight played by R. Marcus Taylor) it does for the most part fulfill its mission breathing life into the origin story of a group whose influence is still being felt. Straight Outta Compton is most successful at showing the human realities behind a kind of music that as soon as it was exposed to the mainstream gave rise to media caricatures and knee-jerk reactions from law-enforcement and conservative groups. (Which isnt to say it didnt sometimes court those responses.) Playing the boys who became Cube and Dre OShea Jackson Jr. and Corey Hawkins are just teenagers trying to master their crafts -- lyric-writing and beat-making respectively -- in a hazard-strewn environment. The script contradicts some published accounts of how these two became collaborators with a drug dealer known as Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell) Here Dre seeks him out as a source of capital. Only after the vocalists theyve hired to record Cubes lyrics back out is E cajoled into going on mike himself -- and hes laughably bad until Dre gives some direction. Read more Dr. Dre Ice Cube Break Silence on N.W.A Movie Suge Knights Murder Charge and a Reunion Tour (With Eminem) That cut ""Boyz-n-the-Hood"" is a local hit attracting the attention of an older white manager Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti). ""I can make you legit"" he says and he does connect the group with Priority Records which releases the groundbreaking Straight Outta Compton. But he also manages to become a partner in Eazy-Es Ruthless Records and though the movie is vague about the details to underpay everyone in the group but E. This leads to the departure of Cube who is forced to keep reminding people he wrote most of this stuff and isnt getting his share; before long Dre goes his own way founding Death Row Records with the hotheaded Knight. Before the breakup though there is ""F--- tha Police"" an anthem that scared the hell out of Middle America but makes perfect sense here spilling from Cubes pen only after multiple scenes in which racist abusive LAPD officers humiliate the rappers and their neighbors for no reason. Touring behind Compton the band fills huge venues learning to be grateful for public outcry and police harassment all of which just generates record sales. While the movie makes sense of the passions behind that song it isnt at all concerned with those who claimed the groups other tracks glorified crime. And it cares even less about complaints concerning misogyny in their lyrics Women are nonentities in this film the spoils of commercial success. Only after a couple rise to the rank of girlfriend or wife do they even get to speak with two or three lines of dialogue suggesting they may be sentient creatures. In one repugnant moment our boisterous heroes celebrate the conclusion of a comic-gangsta showdown by tossing a nearly naked woman into a hotel hallway and locking the door behind her. N.W.A. members DJ Yella and MC Ren get minor attention here (as Yella Neil Brown Jr. is the wry highlight of a few scenes). But theyre less important to the overall story than Knight who as Death Rows resident kingpin lived high while artists like Tupac Shakur Snoop Dogg and others made him millions. In a variation from showbiz-bio convention Compton gives us not one exploiter but two The white Heller and the black Knight both enter the tale with something real to offer and maybe even with decent intentions. But both are poisonous -- violently so in Knights case -- and must be escaped by the artists even at the cost of great sums of money. No worries There was plenty to be made after Comptons story ended.

Gary Gray turns the meteoric rise and fractious fall of rap supergroup N.W.A. into a sprawling exhilarating Los Angeles hip-hop epic. The ferocious rhymes of hip-hop icons N.W.A.s controversial 1988 anthem ""F-k tha Police"" scarcely seem to have aged when they blast on to the soundtrack of ""Straight Outta Compton"" echoing into a world where the abuse of black Americans at the hands of law-enforcement officials remains common headline news. But if ""Compton"" is undeniably of the moment its also timeless in its depiction of how artists and writers transform the world around them into angry profane vibrant and singular personal expression. A conventional music-world biopic in outline but intensely human and personal in its characterizations and attention to detail director F. Gary Grays movie is a feast for hip-hop connoisseurs and novices alike as it charts the West Coast rap superstars meteoric rise fractious in-fighting and discovery that the music business can be as savage as the inner-city streets. A very smart piece of counter-programming in a summer dominated by lily-white tentpole movies Universals Aug. 14 opener should keep the studio clocking much dollars at the late-summer box office. When it dropped in 1988 N.W.A.s first studio album (from which the movie takes its title) shook the hip-hop world from its solid East Coast moorings with its button-pushing madly rhythmic depictions of thug life in South L.A. -- an ur-text for the subgenre that would become known as ""gangsta rap"" though N.W.A.s members themselves preferred the term ""reality rap."" Along with Public Enemys ""It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back"" (released the same year) ""Compton"" was the album that fully announced hip-hop as the rage-filled protest music of its era -- a primal scream from under the boot of white authority or what the critic Nelson George called ""the full-blown sound of revolution."" The groups charismatic 19-year-old rapper and lyricist OShea ""Ice Cube"" Jackson (played here by his real-life son OShea Jr.) said he and his bandmates were merely ""street reporters"" filing dispatches from the from the front lines of a resource-starved community engaged in trench warfare with the Daryl Gates-era LAPD. Everything about N.W.A. was confrontational starting with their name (short for ""Niggaz With Attitude""). Grays panoramic film (running a densely packed two-and-a-half-hours) is the story of N.W.A. yes but also of the city in those same years -- a long-simmering discontent that finally erupted into the 1992 riots. But first we begin in 1986 with the DNA of N.W.A. -- the friendship between Cube and aspiring DJ Andre ""Dr. Dre"" Young (Corey Hawkins) and their courtship of a neighborhood drug dealer Eric ""Eazy-E"" Wright (Jason Mitchell) to funnel some of his illicit funds into a record label (appropriately dubbed Ruthless) for burgeoning West Coast hip-hop acts. And its Wright (brilliantly played by Mitchell the biggest revelation among the young actors) who emerges as ""Comptons"" most compellingly complex character a hip-hop Napoleon whose small stature and high-pitched voice mask a shrewd business acumen. Even when Gray (who made his feature debut directing the real Ice Cube in the stoner-slacker classic ""Friday"") puts ""Compton"" through the somewhat familiar biopic paces he brings a richness of observation to the table that transcends cliche. (The exhaustively researched screenplay is credited to Jonathan Herman and Andrea Berloff from a story by S. Leigh Savidge Alan Wenkus and Berloff.) The live performance and recording scenes have the same loose semi-improvised feel of the ones in the recent Beach Boys drama ""Love amp; Mercy"" especially when Eazy steps up to a mic for the very first time to lay down his hit single ""Boyz-n-the-Hood"" and Cube performs an early version of ""Gangsta Gangsta"" at a nightclub where slow-jam Ramp;B is the house style. These early brushes with fame bring the N.W.A. boys into the orbit of Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti sporting a swooping gray toupee) a veteran rock manager who pledges to lead his new clients into the lap of white music-biz respectability. But while Heller may be the prototypical wolf in Jewish cowboy couture ""Straight Outta Compton"" is loath to pass rash judgments on its characters whose motivations Gray and the writers strive to understand even when their actions verge on the monstrous. (The only unqualified monster here is the bodyguard-turned-mogul Marion ""Suge"" Knight played with terrifying force of presence by R. Marcos Taylor.) ""Compton"" doesnt make the N.W.A. members themselves into paragons of virtue even as it suggests that much of their swagger and braggadocio were more performance than reality -- as well as necessary defense mechanisms on streets where real gangbangers posed a serious threat and where the police made little distinction between one type of young black man and another. Gray plunges us into that pressure-cooker atmosphere repeatedly including one scene -- depicted here as the inspiration for ""F-k tha Police"" -- that cant help but send a chill through the theater in light of the recent events in Ferguson and other black communities While taking a break from the ""Compton"" recording sessions the rappers are descended on by a swarm of Torrance cops who humiliatingly shake them down while disparaging the very existence of hip-hop. Gray casts a wider net in the films second half as friction among the three N.W.A. principals (over money natch) sends them spinning off into their own orbits Cube with movie projects and a platinum solo career Dre as a prolific producer who -- in and out of tumultuous partnership with Knight -- helps to foster a new generation of hip-hop talent (including Snoop Dogg Tupac and Eminem). The former friends turn rivals trading barbed insults on their albums and occasional fisticuffs in public. Then L.A. burns and out of the ashes a relaxing of tensions -- and hope of an N.W.A. reunion -- begins to take hold. But even as the film broadens its scope Grays direction remains sharp and vibrant giving us a ""Rashomon""-style sense of how post-N.W.A. life looked from each characters perspective and reaching unexpected depths of emotional power as Wright starts to succumb to the AIDS-related complications that would cut his life short at age 31 in 1995. The movie has been made in high but never overindulgent style with Matthew Libatiques richly textured widescreen camerawork deliberately avoiding shopworn images of South Central life while evoking a vivid sense of place and the editing of Billy Fox and Michael Tronick keeping the complex narrative moving smoothly from beat to beat. The encyclopedic soundtrack -- ranging across the N.W.A. catalog its members solo ventures their old-school Ramp;B influences and the top-40 pop hip-hop would displace as the dominant sound of the era -- has been assembled with similarly meticulous care.

The movie was fantastic Reply Rene Rose says August 17 2015 at 921 am This movie was too short and should have been co-directed by someone who knows how to put real facts into a story. It is kind of hard to fit all of the wonderful things that came out of this group. You have artists like Tupac and Bone Thugs and Harmony that were briefly viewed. This creates confusion for the next generation. They have no idea what is going on and ask questions during the movie to try and catch up. How can you leave out songs like ""Real MFN Gz?"" This was the song that truly made me an Eazy-E fan. To see the growth of the group is an amazing thing but maybe this movie should have been divided into 2. We the audience want more and do not mind you the directors and writers taking this movie back and editing it for 2 parts maybe even 3. I did not like the scene where Tupac was recording California Love"" because we are talking about Tupac here. Not saying to make it all about him but he was damn near the Martin Luther King of our generation. What about Eazy-E helping Bone Thugs and Harmony create their unique sound that my 65 year old father enjoys? Leaving things out like this is a tragedy to music a tragedy to the legacy that Eazy-E left behind. The dope dealer who put the money behind these men. But other than that thanks for creating the movie and bringing me back to my childhood to remember the L.A. Riots the Rodney King beating and the love and freedom of speech we can put in our music. Just remember you are teaching the next generation and they might need a little bit more being technology babies and all. -Rene Rose Reply djsmokemixtapes says August 16 2015 at 640 pm [Mixtape] Straight Outta Da Catalog (N.W.A.)

The reality is the that race-baiter is the racist. Desperately pointing their finger at everyone else to disguise their own racism. Instigating culture wars racial animosity and violence in the streets for a profit. The smug white liberal glorifying the soundtrack to Black on Black crime in the media from the safety of a pricey lib enclave paid for with the profits from lording over Blacks in slums of poverty for the last 50 years. Reply FACE says August 3 2015 at 623 pm Nice unnecessary race-baiting use of lily white there. Well done.

Janet says August 2 2015 at 341 pm Hopefully the film does well. The trailer is awful. Reply Bert Q says August 2 2015 at 918 am Just make money - who cares about reality...or facts. Reply Debbie Goodman says July 31 2015 at 900 pm I recently interviewed R. Marcos Taylor who plays ""Suge Knight"" in the movie. Look for it on my show ""Martial Arts Mania"". Reply rumrunna says July 31 2015 at 239 pm Now we need a 2 Live Crew Bio Pic . . . Luke and crew impacted all genres of music and forced the Supreme Court to further define the First Amendment for all artists and listener. They also single-handedly removed a governor while making some cheese at the same time. Reply Erick Osorio says July 31 2015 at 129 pm Being an extra for the film was a great experience but I was most impressed with how Grays direction was sharp and very precise. The concert set was amazing great prop design. Once the cameras were rolling and the scene was being filmed I knew the level of detail and authenticity Gray was going for. Glad to hear the finished product lives somewhat to its name. Reply MC Conscientious Objector says July 31 2015 at 1232 pm You might want to post a spoiler alert at the top of your review. I didnt want to know something was going to happen in the break from the recording session Fortunately I looked away and picked up in the next paragraph but now I wont be caught by surprise at that point. And yes Ren is one of the best parts of that first album. ""For the record its Ren but for the street its Villain and strapped with a gat its more like Matt Dillon."" Reply RTF916 says July 31 2015 at 205 pm Didnt see anything in the review that isnt already common knowledge. NWAs story is already for public consumption readily available with a quick google search and common knowledge to anyone that was remotely a fan in that era. Any signature surprising content of the writers director or actors that may take place in this film which a biopic is typically dependent on is only given in tiny samples in the review from what I can see. Reply DJ says July 31 2015 at 1118 am I hope this film breaks box office records but I find it a bit dull to Yella and Ren pushed to the background. Yella produced alongside of Dre and probably more experienced - arguably even more talented. Ren and DOC practically saved the franchise with their lyrical contributions when Ice Cube bolted after the groups first major tour. Niggaz 4 Life (post Ice Cube) was a better album. However I will go into the theater watching with low expectations and hope to be surprised. Reply RTF916 says July 31 2015 at 209 pm Yeah Im sure an NWA movie which focused primarily on MC Ren and DJ Yella would be a box office smash. Come on man. Its a movie. A studio funded movie at that. You know theyre going to focus on the stars. Reply Soapstef says August 13 2015 at 935 am This is why Im not in any hurry to see it. I was hoping Yella amp; Ren would play a big part. I knew it would happen. LOL says July 31 2015 at 942 am This movie is a tentpole posing as a sleeper. Watch it explode. Reply Carl White says July 31 2015 at 914 pm I agree LOL I am a middle aged white guy this is the film I have been waiting for more than anything. Damn I hope its good. Reply Ed Lover says July 31 2015 at 910 am Im so annoyed that the trailers Ive seen dont list MC Ren or Yella at all. Guess I shouldnt be suprised that they also dont get mentioned in this review. They had an incredible impact on NWA and should get proper credit. Reply Daniels says July 31 2015 at 609 pm Its just a trailer They are in the film so whats the problem? Stop complaining. Reply RTF916 says July 31 2015 at 211 pm Probably because....its a review of the the movie not the group itself or any of its albums. Sheesh what is wrong with some of the commenters here? Does anyone expect a studio movie production about NWA to focus on DJ Yella and MC Ren? Good grief man. Reply weareregalradio says July 31 2015 at 815 am Reblogged this on WARR - We Are Regal Radio and commented A very positive early review. Cant wait until the 14th. Reply Justin Greed says July 31 2015 at 220 am Id like F. Gary to chime in and explain how the individuals are being compensated particularly Yella and MC Ren. I saw an interview were Yella said that Ice Cube and Dre were going to pay him a ""consulting fee""? What does that entail? Are they getting any back end?Are they each at least going to see 7 figures? Its not like Dre or Cube NEED it. Reply Joe C says July 31 2015 at 1216 am Uh Officer Wilson was acting in self defense in Ferguson. The evidence was so overwhelming Eric Holder couldnt even convene a grand jury. Why do leftist ""journalists"" continue the fiction of ""hands up dont shoot"" which never happened. Reply Annie says July 31 2015 at 430 am The District Attorney didnt want to prosecute the officer he even ignored the fact that one of the witnesses lied. The District Attorney said that he did all that he could to help the officer. That is not his job. Because the D.A. thought that he was working for the Police Officer justice was not served.
