"The 1991 Review of ""Terminator 2 Judgment Day"" - Mick LaSalle Mick LaSalle The 1991 Review of ""Terminator 2 Judgment Day"" By Mick LaSalle on June 30 2015 at 1051 AM --Print Arnold Schwarzenegger File PhotosArnold Schwarzenegger promoting TERMINATOR 2 in 1991. In my review of ""Terminator Genisys"" I mention the excitement that ""Terminator 2"" caused in 1991.  Here is the review unedited but probably very close (or identical) to what appeared in the Chronicle in 1991 The technical side of movie making gets more remarkable from year to year and ""Terminator 2"" which opens today in the Bay Area is one of those movies that can legitimately be called an advance. Its amazing enough that film makers today can put on screen anything you can imagine. ""Terminator 2"" imagines things you wouldnt ever be likely to dream and gets these visions on to the screen with a seamlessness thats mind-boggling. A movie like ""Terminator 2"" has two tricks to pull off. First is the technical end making the impossible possible. The second is dramatic end coming up with a story thats strong enough to support all the stunts and visuals without becoming overwhelmed. This second is the harder part -- in a movie thats as visually astonishing as ""Terminator 2"" its the equivalent of walking around with a billion dollars in your pocket and getting everybody to like you for your personality. ""Terminator 2"" succeeds. James Cameron (""Terminator"" ""The Abyss"") who wrote and directed scales his effects to the bigness of his story and his story here is huge the fate of three billion lives the survival of mankind. Audiences have a built-in rooting interest in this sort of thing. With the stakes this high the extraordinary visuals seem natural and appropriate. But as impressive as anything in ""Terminator 2"" is its disturbing austere tone. Its a somber strange picture. Theres a major chase scene early on in which an 18-wheel truck pursues a motorcycle. The scene is notable for its stunts -- the most outstanding is when the truck drives off an overpass and lands on the road below. But theres something else about it Theres no music on the sound track -- no horn section blaring as is usually the case with chase scenes -- just the steady beat of a drum machine. Its as flashy a chase as youre ever going to see but the effect is oddly stark and cold. The movie takes place in the near future and begins in much the same way as the last `Terminator."" Arnold Schwarzenegger in a burst of streaking electric jolts arrives naked in Los Angeles in need of clothes. Instead of checking the yellow pages for a big mans shop he walks into a biker bar in search of a man his size as though one might exist. ""I need your clothes your boots and your motorcycle"" he says calmly to one of the bikers. ""Terminator 2"" is a crowd pleaser from the first minute. Schwarzeneggers Terminator is a model almost identical to the Terminator from the other movie only he looks about seven years older now and has a better haircut. He is in search of Johnny Connor the young teenaged boy who in the next century is destined to lead a revolt against an evil robot society. Also in pursuit of Johnny is another Terminator a slimmer baby-faced one played by Robert Patrick. This New Terminator is the superior model because it is made of liquid metal and can assume the shape of just about any living organism that it touches. The difference between Arnolds Terminator and the New Terminator can be likened to the difference between the splashy and impressive old gas-guzzlers of years ago and the more understated efficient and technologically advanced cars of today. Arnolds is the good cyborg in this sequel sent back in time from the year 2029 by the adult John Connor of the future to protect the young John Connor and his mother Sarah who has been confined to a mental institution for insisting that her experiences in the last ""Terminator"" were real. The New Terminator is out to kill both of them. The special effects sequences involving the New Terminators transformations into various shapes are so perfect that you almost begin to take them for granted. He gets shot in the face and his head becomes two metal slabs split in half which slowly ooze back together and make his face whole again. In another scene the New Terminator hides himself as part of a black and white checkered floor and then rises out of the floor the image looking like something out of a Dali painting. ""The Terminator 2"" is as relentless as the earlier movie and it also has the same human dimension. Sarah Johnny and Schwarzeneggers Terminator make up an unconventional but winning family three distinct personalities whom we come to care about. Since the last film Sarah has become Rambo a selfless guerilla fighter afraid of nothing. In Johnny we can see qualities of daring and conscience seeds of the future leader as played by young Edward Furlong in more-than-just-the-usual kid actor debut. Schwarzenegger is at the center of the film as big as anything in it seemingly capable of anything -- when he rides on a motorcycle shooting open the locks on gates just as he rides through them it seems reasonable. And hes wonderfully funny in that blank-faced self-aware way he has. Without overplaying it he makes his Terminator an almost lovable figure awkward and limited but in his own way devoted. In the first ""Terminator"" Sarah Connor was trying to keep future history from changing. But here her and Johnnys goal is more ambitious to change history by preventing a future world war from taking place. In order to succeed they have to become present-day outlaws and lose their places in future history. ""Terminator 2"" contains only one logical flub that I could detect. At one point the New Terminator has Sarah helpless and tells her to call out for Johnny. Why? The New Terminator can assume her shape and imitate her voice. He doesnt need her help. ""The Terminator 2"" is movie-making on a massive scale packed dense with spectacular touches that are too many to describe -- escape scenes helicopter stunts and huge explosions. Perhaps most impressive and unforgettable is the fantasy sequence in which a nuclear wave of light and heat blows through a city and melts everything it doesnt knock down.

New-model `Terminator` Improves On Original - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs New-model `Terminator` Improves On OriginalJuly 05 1991|By Gene Siskel.Our Flick of the Week is ``Terminator 2 Judgment Day`` and thanks to some truly spectacular and at times mystifying special effects-as well as some surprisingly solid acting-this is one terrific action picture more enjoyable than the original. Once again Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a manlike machine sent back from the future this time to protect a little boy who if allowed to grow up can help save the world from complete destruction. The only problem is that there is another more technologically advanced machine also sent from the future with designs on killing the kid and Schwarzenegger too.Writer-director James Cameron has cast his film extremely well with Robert Patrick as the evil Terminator more sullen and less macho than you might expect. His skin covers a mass of liquid metal that can change shape at will and is seemingly impervious to attack-bullet holes close up and if you break him apart he comes together like mercury from a broken thermometer. Also impressive are Linda Hamilton as the tough mother and Edward Furlong as a credible kid. He has a fresh father-son relationship with Schwarzenegger because sometimes the kid plays the father teaching the machine that there is more to life on Earth than just killing.Best of all though the level of tension in the film is palpable because we can`t figure out how Arnold is going to terminate the Terminator.``Terminator 2`` is playing at the Burnham Plaza McClurg Court Webster Place and outlying theaters.

Terminator 2 Judgment Day (which officially opens today after Monday and Tuesday-night previews) may seem like a betrayal to hard-core exploitation fans. And even with a lower body count than the original Terminator the sequel is still far too rough for the kiddie crowd.But for those who fall between these extremes this could be the big bang of the summer.Cameron who also co-wrote and directed the original Terminator apparently had a problem. The cult appeal of the first picture was its relentless killing. And while that high-tech film noir did better business than might have been expected from such a soul-deadening production the stakes are much higher for the sequel which may have cost almost three times the 35 million that the first film grossed.For Terminator 2 to be commercially successful it had to have much more than cult appeal.Camerons other problem this time around concerned Schwarzenegger who now has a wholesome reputation that doesnt jibe with wasting innocents as he did in the first Terminator. Back in 1984 after all Arnold hadnt been appointed Chairman of the Presidents Council on Physical Fitness and Sports hadnt married Maria Shriver and wasnt rumored to be considering a run for political office.To solve these problems Cameron has de-emphasized the tech-noir elements of the first film and made Schwarzenegger the good guy this time. Theres still senseless killing in Terminator 2 but Arnold tends to confine himself to strategic maiming.Early in the new film we discover that two Terminators (not counting the one demolished in 1984) have been sent to our era from the future. The one Arnold plays is here to protect a young boy named John Connor who is destined to become a great leader in the future struggle between humans and machines.The other Terminator played by an unknown with weird ears is a more technically advanced model whose mission is to kill the boy. The T-1000 as this Terminator is called is made of liquid metal which means that no matter how many pieces he is broken into he can always liquefy and regroup. Hes also able to assume the appearance of almost any object which makes for scenes that will take you back to your first encounter with Silly Putty.Although I was put off by the obvious calculation that Cameron and co-writer William Wisher (who also did some uncredited writing on the first Terminator) have brought to the new project I found myself getting caught up in the plot which displays more variety and ingenuity than the rather ahem straightforward chase-chase-chase story of the original movie. (That Arnold is a good guy this time is revealed gradually and cleverly.) The reportedly biggest-in-history budget of the new production has given Cameron the chance to stage the sort of special-effects sequences that could only be suggested in the 1984 film and his intervening projects such as Aliens and The Abyss have clearly sharpened his action-scene skills.The action in Terminator 2 is edited for maximum suspense and much of it is mounted on such a grand scale that little in movie history comes close. (Scenes in last summers Die Hard 2 did but they lacked the finesse of the new film). A chase involving an emergency vehicle and a helicopter is alarmingly effective and when a building explodes late in the movie you can almost feel the theater shake.In the first Terminator the characters were constructed as functions of the plot They carried out the requirements of the story without wiggle room to expand their characters.Not so this time. Reprising her role as Sarah Connor (Johns mother) Linda Hamilton has acquired a driven look in her eyes. The knowledge that the fate of the world rests on her shoulders has changed Sarah - and her shoulders too. More muscular and meaner she sometimes seems like a Terminator herself. Yet shes fully human and we share the desperation of her struggle.Young Edward Furlong isnt bad as John Connor although he overdoes the smart-aleck act and some of his feel-good moments with Arnolds Terminator (whom the boy calls Uncle Bob) are just a little too close for comfort to the scenes between Will Robinson and the robot in Lost in Space. As the T-1000 Robert Patrick doesnt have to act much but his sleek physique offers a striking contrast to Arnolds bulked-up body. Rounding out the cast is Joe Morton playing a scientist for Skynet (something like the Strategic Defense Initiative) who comes to see the error of his ways.1 | 2 | Next MORELottery results for Powerball Florida LottoLottery results for Powerball Florida LottoDo your homework before painting or sealing cool deckPuerto Rico birth certificates How to get a new oneLottery results for Powerball Florida LottoLottery results for Powerball Florida Lotto Related ArticlesTerminator 2 Hes Back - And Better Than BeforeDecember 13 1991Good Terminator Meets Bad TerminatorJune 28 1998The Terminator Hits TownMay 10 1996Hes Back But As Kinder Gentler TerminatorJuly 3 1991Index by Keyword|Index by Date|Privacy Policy|Terms of ServicePlease note the green-lined linked article text has been applied commercially without any involvement from our newsroom editors reporters or any other editorial staff.,http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1991-07-03/lifestyle/9107020200_1_original-terminator-terminator-2-first-terminator,200,terminator2judgmentday2,terminator2judgmentday,orlandosentinel
Terminating A Trend? - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Terminating A Trend?2nd Schwarzenegger Extravaganza Electrifies But There May Be No Future In ItJuly 03 1991|By Dave Kehr Movie critic.And now a kinder gentler even more expensive Terminator.Director James Cameron established himself as one of the most creative action hands of his generation with ``The Terminator`` a 1984 sleeper about a conscienceless death-dealing robot from the future played by a snarling Arnold Schwarzenegger whose mission it was to eliminate the mother (Linda Hamilton) of a revolutionary leader-to-be.Seven years later a lot has changed.The cycle of massively budgeted ultraviolent special-effects extravaganzas that ``The Terminator`` helped to initiate now seemsto be coming to an end to be replaced by the sort of female-centered melodrama that has been revived by Julia Roberts or the sentimental comedy of a ``City Slickers.``On the other hand is arguably the world`s biggest box office draw and``The Terminator`` remains perhaps his best-known role-the part that transformed him from a freakish muscle man into a major movie star.If there is a sure bet in the high-risk world of film production it would seem to be ``Terminator 2.`` More presold than this you do not get.Accordingly a lot of money has been placed on the table-at least as much as 80 million (according to official sources) and perhaps as much as 110 million (according to the Hollywood rumor mill). In all probability``Terminator 2`` is the most expensive movie ever made.And it is a good summer movie directed with great verve and imagination and filled with innovative eye-popping effects. Cameron never relinquishes his grip on the audience smoothly segueing from action sequence to action sequence and topping himself each time. Semi-trailers chase motorcycles down crowded L.A. expressways; office buildings explode into millions of smoking bits; and characters dangle over huge cauldrons of molten steel firing elaborate automatic weapons at each other.What ``Terminator 2`` is not is a well-filled-out emotionally engaging film-this despite Cameron`s obvious and admirable efforts to expand his characters psychologically and instill deeper moral values in hisstorytelling.The new film is less arty than Cameron`s jumbled ambitious failure of 1989 ``The Abyss`` but less satisfying less emotionally valid than his``Aliens`` of 1986.Paradoxically Cameron`s efforts to create a more mature more humanistic ``Terminator`` make it seem strangely compromised as if the movie had been deliberately brought in line with the new sentimentality of Roberts and company. At times it plays less like ``Terminator 2`` than the sequel to Schwarzenegger`s good-natured Christmas hit ``Kindergarten Cop.``It is 10 years after ``Terminator 1`` and the Hamilton character`s child John (Edward Furlong) is now a maladjusted adolescent placed in the care of uncomprehending stepparents while his mother still muttering darkly of nuclear holocausts and time-traveling robots is seething away in a state mental institution.It`s a shock to everyone when the Terminator reappears-he was after all obliterated at the end of the initial film. But this is a new Terminator literally and metaphorically who has been reprogrammed to protect young John against a more potent threat from the future-a newfangled cyborg the T-1000(Robert Patrick) made from a kind of shape-shifting metal that can assume the appearance of any object or person its own size. (The effects that Stan Winston has produced for the character apparently based in computer-generated animation are scary seamlessly convincing and sometimes quite beautiful.)Once John and the Terminator break Mom out of stir the problem becomes one of avoiding the new assassin while tracking down the computer scientist(Joe Morton) who will one day invent a doomsday device.But the real business of the movie is to form a redemptive family unit out of the three main characters. Early on John forbids the Terminator to kill; he is permitted only to maim and mutilate a distinction that some may see as little more than a nuance. But with this grounding in basic human decency the big lovable lug of a robot begins to learn. Soon he is doing high fives and using Valley slang.In his films since the original ``Terminator`` Cameron has been developing a set of themes centered on the survival of the nuclear family in the face of evil and the unknown the mother-daughter bond that forms in``Aliens`` between an astronaut and a young girl; the once-married couple that through the haze of murky metaphor that is ``The Abyss`` gives symbolic rebirth to itself.In ``Terminator 2`` Cameron finally produces a complete family turning Schwarzenegger into a strong protective dad; the angry paranoid pumped-up Hamilton into a loving mother; and the resentful rebellious John into an all- American boy.1 | 2 | Next MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesAction icon Arnold Schwarzenegger is back on theater...July 17 19945 Awards For `Terminator 2` But Hopkins Wins Best ActorMarch 19 1992Hollywood On 1.25 Million A DayDecember 14 1997It`s Hard To Know What Makes A Film SucceedAugust 1 1991`Titanic Skipper Seeshamilton Jump ShipDecember 16 1998Find More Stories AboutLinda HamiltonTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter,http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-07-03/features/9103160358_1_terminator-director-james-cameron-expensive-movie,200,terminator2judgmentday3,terminator2judgmentday,chicagotribune
"MOVIE REVIEW  He Said Hed Be Back . . .  Arnold and Terminator 2 Return With a Vengeance - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEW  He Said Hed Be Back . . .  Arnold and Terminator 2 Return With a VengeanceJuly 03 1991|KENNETH TURAN | TIMES FILM CRITIC He has built it. And yes without a doubt they will come.He is the gifted James Cameron the consensus choice as the action director of his generation. What hes built is ""Terminator 2 Judgment Day"" the most eagerly awaited film of the summer and one of the most expensive (officially 88 million and counting) ever made. More elaborate than the original but just as shrewdly put together it cleverly combines the most successful elements of its predecessor with a number of new twists (would you believe a kinder gentler Terminator?) to produce one hell of a wild ride a Twilight of the Gods that takes no prisoners and leaves audiences desperate for mercy.If you dont count ""Piranha II"" (and Cameron doesnt) the original 1984 ""Terminator"" was his first job as a director. It remains an exceptional debut a lean laconic action classic that benefited not only from the mans enviable skills as an orchestrator of mayhem but also from the tale he came up with a machine that looks like a human being is sent from the future to the present in order to kill one Sarah Connor a hapless waitress whose yet unborn son will in a distant post-nuclear holocaust time lead the forces of humanity in a war against (what else but) power-mad machines.That assassin is the Terminator a very tough nut whose modus operandi is described as follows ""It cant be bargained with. It cant be reasoned with. It doesnt feel remorse or pity or fear. And it absolutely will not stop until you are dead."" As played by Arnold Schwarzenegger whose witty ""Night of the Living Dead"" delivery turned this into the role of a lifetime the Terminator became a major anti-hero the monster from the id you couldnt help but admire.""Terminator 2"" (citywide) takes up a decade after the first one ends. Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton returning from the original) finds herself in a state mental hospital for insisting that the Terminator was not a figment of her imagination. Her 10-year-old son John the future hope of the world (newcomer Edward Furlong) is a whiny brat living in the Valley and making life miserable for his foster parents. He thinks his mom is not to put too fine a point on it a loser.Though thwarted in the past the evil machines of the future refuse to wimp out. They send a new model Terminator the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) to finish the job and kill young John. Based on the same computer-generated technology that Cameron first used in ""The Abyss"" (remember the water magically turning into a face?) the T-1000 is a remarkable piece of special effects sleight-of-hand a mercury-like creature able to not only change shapes at will but to also return to its original form no matter what. Like an old Timex watch it takes a licking and keeps on ticking.Sarah and John are not however without resources. A now-outmoded but still canny T-800 model (Schwarzenegger) is reprogrammed to look kindly on humans and sent back to give them a hand. Adding to the T-800s difficulties however young John suddenly develops a humanitarian streak and insists that his Terminator not kill anyone when a good maiming will do just as nicely. Watching Schwarzeneggers Terminator cope with these new ethical guidelines is one of this sequels more delicious conceits.Despite these new wrinkles ""Terminator 2"" does not so much start slowly (for Cameron likes to let you know whose film youre in as soon as possible) as derivatively. Some of the films opening sequences such as the way the T-800 goes about getting clothes and wheels feel like more elaborate but not necessarily more involving versions of scenes from the first film. Even in action films bigger is not necessarily better.But ""Terminator 2"" like its namesake is nothing if not determined and we are soon won over. For one thing though Edward Furlong is more irritating as John Connor than he really needs to be that is more than made up by the other principals. Schwarzenegger for one re-embraces this role like a long lost relative--no one can say ""It must be destroyed"" quite the way he can--and Hamilton brings a level of physical intensity to her new model pumped-up paranoid Sarah Connor that even devotees of the first film will find pleasantly surprising.As for the script Cameron and co-writer William Wisher have done more than make sure that ""Terminator 2"" is well-stocked with the kind of wised-up shoot-from-the-hip wit that characterized the first film. Sensing that a series of Terminator vs. Terminator chases would soon become boring no matter how excellent the effects they sensibly opted to take the middle of the film down a different more intriguing road one involving a computer scientist (a very fine appearance by Joe Morton) who is investigating the relics of the first Terminator.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword",http://articles.latimes.com/1991-07-03/entertainment/ca-1467_1_arnold-schwarzenegger,200,terminator2judgmentday4,terminator2judgmentday,latimes

A Review.By Carrie Rickey Inquirer Movie CriticPosted July 03 1991The jury is still out on Arnold Schwarzenegger as an actor. As a machine hes a star. If the dazzling entertainment Terminator 2 Judgment Day proves anything its that in playing a cyborg hulk with robotic joint movements and mechanical voice Schwarzenegger is at his most compassionate.Terminator 2 boasts such stunning action and special effects that everyone can agree that the film looks like the zillion dollars it reportedly cost to make - 90 million is more precise making it one of the most expensive movies of all time.Since all films cost the same to ticket-buyers - around 6 - the only criterion is Is Terminator 2 worth it? While for its freshness I preferred the first installment in this heavy-metal update of Jesus Nativity and Agony the sequel is an engaging and amusing preview of the apocalypse. It is moreover a stirring call to arms - to eliminate arms. Not for nothing does writer/director James Cameron call it ""a violent movie about peace.""The movie predicts what could happen if mankind continues to let machines - which have neither morals nor scruples - make decisions that would ultimately destroy human life. Terminator proposed a world in which a machinefrom 2029 sent a robot emissary to 1984 Los Angeles to try to stop the conception of a future human savior named John Connor (J.C. - get it?).John (Edward Furlong) is now 10 and a juvenile delinquent. His mother Sarah (the divine Linda Hamilton) has been institutionalized because doctors find her guerrilla schemes to prevent a nuclear apocalypse certifiable. Sent back from the future are two Terminators one to protect John the other to make certain hes killed so that he wont be such an effective enemy to future machines.Bringing new meaning to the concept of ""nuclear family"" Sarah John and their Terminator guardian wage a lightning war to secure lasting peace. Although in terms of logic this is doublethink in terms of moviemaking its thrilling. Like Camerons Aliens Terminator 2 effectively taps into every parental and ecological anxiety.Schwarzenegger played the enemy cyborg ultimately vanquished in Terminator so its at first hard to accept him as the saviors savior. (Perhaps all Terminators of his model type are identical?) Yet so absorbing is the action in this two-hours-plus saga that you dont worry about this for more than a nanosecond.If Terminator 2 were a vehicle it would be a Harley-Davidson equipped with the ability to fly and to dematerialize to vault over obstacles - or zoom through them. Why walk through a door or drive on a paved road when walking through solids or smashing through fortresses is more cinematic?Cameron has created a seemingly invincible Terminator archvillain T-1000 (Robert Patrick) who is like liquid mercury in his ability to melt and like Proteus in his ability to assume any form he wants. T-1000 might be the most spectacular film special-effect ever. He/it can ooze through prison bars fool his foes by appearing in the guise of a friend and instantly develop saberlike limbs that he freely uses to impale his victims. He lacks what we humans would call conscience.Fortunately the Terminator played with efficiency and good humor by Schwarzenegger is around to wage battle with this destroyer. And fortunately young John (played to surfer-dude hilt by the charming Furlong) is around to teach the Terminator why its important not to waste humans. And fortunately Johns mother (a newly sinewy Hamilton) is around to teach her son how to take responsibility for mans fate and avert an apocalypse.Its a joyride until you think about the films biggest contradiction. How come this movie celebrating the superiority of human feelings over machine precision is most alive when thrilling in the mechanical perfection of the Terminator and T-1000?Inside Terminator 2 beats a human heart.

Directed by James Cameron from a script by Cameron and William Wisher. City Centre Factoria Lewis amp; Clark Oak Tree Seatac Mall Thunderbird drive-in. ""R"" - Restricted due to extreme violence. ----------------------------------------------------------- Hes back - and this time hes the good guy Not that it matters. Arnold Schwarzenegger - reprising his most famous role in this sequel to James Camerons 1984 sci-fi hit - has reached the point where he can do no wrong. The crowd at the promotional screening I attended Monday was cheering Schwarzeneggers casual killings and maimings before they were even aware of the switcheroo that Cameron had pulled on them. Ten years have passed since Sarah Conner (Linda Hamilton) faced down and destroyed the first Terminator - a homicidal robot from the future who has a grudge against the human race. But things still arent looking good. Sarah has nuclear war on her mind. She knows when its coming down to the time and date. If thats not bad enough theres the constant possibility that other Terminators will be sent to kill her or her son (Edward Furlong) John. The kid is destined to become a great military leader in the War Against the Machines that follows the nuclear war. Not surprisingly Sarahs ranting about time-traveling Terminators and nuclear war has cast doubts on her mental health and shes been institutionalized. John in the meantime has become a small-time juvenile delinquent living with foster parents he despises. Hes on the outs with his mother too whose ravings about his leadership role in a post-apocalyptic world sound pretty far-fetched. But theyre not. Encounters with two robotic types at the local mall are enough to convince him his life is in danger. His problem How to tell which is trying to kill him and which is trying to save him? As it turns out the trigger-happy Schwarzenegger-model is preferable to the T-1000 make (portrayed by a frosty Robert Patrick). T-1000 is a liquid-metal android that can change shape at will. Once young John and the pro-human Terminator hook up its just a matter of springing Mom free and helping her destroy the work of a famous computer scientist whose research will lead to the nuclear war. And something has to be done about Arnolds body count. Its far too high. Theres really no need John explains to kill every guy who pulls a gun on you. Schwarzenegger is in impeccable deadpan form milking his tough-guy image for all its worth and getting laughs out of the Terminators wooden parroting of slang (""No problemo"" probably will be a catch-phrase to reckon with this summer). Hamilton trained by an ex-Israeli commando for her newly militarized role (Sarah used to be a waitress) looks ready to lead an army into any inferno. Furlongs John is a cheeky spirited kid unfazed by the small arsenal going off all around him. But they arent the stars of this show. The real scene-stealer is the special effects departments T-1000. Cameron has taken the most memorable image from his underwater epic ""The Abyss"" - the living tentacle of water that mimicked the faces it came across - and developed a whole language from it. T-1000 can masquerade as anything and is virtually indestructable. (As soon as anyone shoots it the gaping holes fill themselves right up again.) Behind all the wizardry however the plot machinations are pretty crude. The films opening 15 minutes are more blast than impact and its finale is stretched to blusterous lengths. Then theres the incompatibility of content and message. Cameron admits in the press kit that this is ""a violent movie about peace."" Make that ""an extremely violent movie."" Spikes go through actors heads and midriffs and unfortunate things happen to motor vehicles too. The scripts pious sign-off - that if a machine can learn to value human life people can too - seems a bit disingenuous when the film is so packed with brutal incidents. This is a movie that adores its own violence then shakes its head with regret over it. The right hand knows what the left is doing - and isnt at all bothered by it. Who knows what kind of message that leaves you with? It isnt the one in the script. Still if youre hoping to be brutalized this summer ""Terminator 2"" is the film to do it.

The reason seemed obvious How many times could you watch this guy? With his steely Teutonic monotone and his well selective range of facial expressions (he had exactly two the blank stare and the angry glower) he was like some grimly idealized worker off a Soviet propaganda poster from the 30s. The Terminator changed all that. By casting Arnold the robot actor as a futuristic killing machine this unbelievably canny thriller unshackled Schwarzeneggers appeal in two ways It merged his hulking gladiatorial presence with the gaudy bloody nihilism of contemporary action flicks effectively turning him into a post-punk Dirty Harry; and more than that (for this was the movies genius) it transformed his lugubrious one-dimensionality into a comic attribute. A lot has changed since then. Arnold in his stardom has become likable -- an enforcer with charm an outsize hero who proved he could step lightly in comedies like Twins and Kindergarten Cop. And so in the enjoyably overwrought Terminator 2 Judgment Day director-cowriter James Cameron pulls a smart switch This time Arnolds terminator isnt a menacing villain but a good guy a father protector who is sent from the future to guard the son of Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). The first movie you may recall ended with Sarah becoming pregnant. Her son now a punky preteen (Edward Furlong) is destined to become the rebel leader in the coming war against the machines. Now another terminator has been dispatched to alter history by killing him. This new terminator (Robert Patrick) is boyishly handsome but with pursed lips and cold dead eyes. He suggests a stoic emaciated James Dean -- hes like Dean as a troop leader of the Hitler Youth. For most of his screen time he skulks around in a policemans uniform pursuing his prey as relentlessly as Arnold did in the first picture. This time though Cameron adds a special-effects coup. Where Arnold has a metal skeleton under his synthetic skin the evil terminator one of the advanced T-1000 series is made entirely of liquid metal. Hes a kind of mutating mercury globule who can bleed through bars pour through windows and take on the physical characteristics of any object he touches from a person to a floor. His arms instantly convert into three-foot-long stilettos and when hes shot in the head his exploded ""flesh"" simply welds itself back together. The transformation effects are spectacular in part because theres real magic to them a sense of technological wonder. By the end of the movie we feel that this shape-shifting terminator this sinister mass of chameleonic metal has an identity all its own. I wish I could say the rest of the movie was as good. Its a solid thriller -- witty at times and packed with extravagantly violent sequences in which helicopters diesel trucks and entire buildings are blown up with delirious gusto. Cameron director of the first Terminator Aliens and the underrated deep-sea epic The Abyss has become our reigning master of heavy-metal action. Yet he has obviously labored to make Terminator 2 a kick-ass fantasy with soul a pop vision that taps into apocalyptic fears and yearnings. And compared to such visionary spectacles as RoboCop or the Mad Max films its really little more than a 90 million B movie. The first hour has a genuine emotional pull. Sarah has been confined to a mental institution because she cant stop babbling about terminators and the nuclear holocaust she knows will occur in 1997 when the automatic defense system set up by the United States -- its called Skynet -- takes on a life of its own. Hamilton brings these scenes a raw anguish especially when she stares down the weasely Dr. Silberman (Earl Boen) whose bureaucratic manner is a form of petty sadism. But once she escapes and hooks up with her son and Arnold the movies narrative power leaks away. Cameron introduces the fantastically hokey idea that world-destroying computer technology could all be the creation of one relatively innocent scientist (Joe Morton). He also makes the mistake of dropping the evil terminator out of the picture for nearly an hour while Sarah has elegiac nuclear nightmares in the desert. For a while the movie loses its pace its kinetic thrust -- even if it is fun to watch Arnolds terminator get humanized (like a hulking Mr. Spock) by learning such catchphrases as ""Hasta la vista baby"" The movie becomes a glorified countdown to the big blowout between the terminators. When its finally King Kong vs. Godzilla time Cameron delivers the goods. The movie preserves the underlying joke of the original Terminator -- that these murderous robots arent at all malevolent in intent. Theyre just maximally efficient programmed to carry out a mission at any cost. And so if cars and phone booths have to get smashed and innocent bystanders are blown away -- well thats just so much meaningless detritus. This reckless indifference to human life is of course intrinsic to the appeal of Terminator 2. The movie is a great big feast of wreckage. But thats also what makes it a bit numbing. At one point Sarahs son whom Arnold is programmed to obey forces him to pledge that he wont kill anyone. Arnold takes the pledge -- and then in order to stay true to it he keeps shooting people in the kneecaps and smashing them against walls not quite forcefully enough to kill them. I kept wondering if Arnolds pledge was such a good idea. From the looks of it these people may live but theyll all end up in wheelchairs. Terminator 2 is a state-of-the-art action movie all right It gets you thinking that the most reasonable thing might just have been to blow everyone away.

His thunderously visceral Terminator 2 Judgment Day has the clash-of-the-titans scale of grand opera but with the lyricism replaced by clanking shrieking metal. In the postnuclear world of 2029 machines have gained supremacy over man and humanitys only hope rests on the shoulders of John Connor the leader of the resistance. In the first movie the cyborg played by Arnold Schwarzenegger was sent back to the 1980s to kill John Connors mother before the warrior could be born. That failed and now a decade later theyve sent back a new improved model (Robert Patrick) to try to kill the boy John (Edward Furlong). But a second cyborg is dispatched as his protector - Arnold again rebuilt as a hero.Can John his fiercely protective mother Sarah (Linda Hamilton) and their metallic guardian angel survive the threat of a liquid-metal cyborg with the ability to take the form of anything it touches? Its a basic action-movie setup the thrill - and the considerable wit - are all in the presentation. Given that this is the most expensive movie ever (box) one expects extraordinary mayhem. And this Cameron delivers with a perfectionists zeal and some of the most special special effects in eons.But Camerons achievement isnt only technical. Hes using all the not-so-cheap thrills of a violent genre to make a movie with an antiviolence message and the wonder of T2 is that he pulls it off without looking silly. (The hypocrisy is built into the form were there after all for the rush of destruction.) Cameron and co-writer William Wisher play a nifty joke on Schwarzeneggers image as the Terminator the kid makes him swear not to kill anybody and its funny watching him waste his enemies without terminating them. Nobody knows how to use Schwarzenegger better than Cameron he was born to play a machine. As a human in ""Total Recall"" he wasnt convincing or vulnerable. Here as an emotionless cyborg acting out the part of a foster father hes impressive hilarious almost touching. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Hamiltons sinewy Sarah a fanatical matriarchal warrior is a wonderfully gaga heroine as ferocious as a lioness protecting her cub and twice as butch as Sigourney Weaver in ""Aliens."" Furlong making his movie debut is a natural. For all its state-of-the-art pyrotechnics and breathtaking thrills this bruisingly exciting movie never loses sight of its humanity. Thats its point and its pride.In the sober tightfisted Hollywood of the 90s its not cool to throw money around. But at Carolco the upstart independent production company that brought the world the ""Rambo"" movies no one is denying that ""Terminator 2"" cost at least 94 million - the most expensive film ever made. The guys who run Carolco are banking that every nickel was worth it they spent at least 12 million on Schwarzenegger because he can pack movie houses all over the world; 6 million on director James Cameron the king of action thrillers; 17 million for special effects including breakthrough computer-generated visuals; millions more for stunts like a motorcycle that flies through a third-story window and connects with a helicopter. Unlike such films with bloated budgets as ""The Godfather Part III"" Carolco execs say they planned to spend about this much money.The company also plans to recoup. Carolco says it already has advances and guarantees of 91 million 61 million alone from overseas theatrical and TV rights. The company sold domestic film-distribution rights to Tri-Star for 4 million and the rest comes from video cable and other TV deals. LIcensing merchandise could bring in 20 million more. This lower-risk high dollar strategy means a lower profit margin. Still if the film is even a modest hit Carolco will begin to rake in percentages on top of these revenues. ""The major studios think we independents should make 3 million movies about sensitive people"" says Carolco executive Roger Smith. ""They would love to see us go away. We have no intention of satisfying them.""Where the  Went12 m Schwarzeneggers salary taken in the form of a Gulfstream 111 jet 6 m James Cameron producer/director/co-writer 10 m Rights to make the sequel 1 m Hamiltons salary 4 m Other prefilming costs including actors salaries 17 m Special effects 34 m Other production costs from stunts to catering 10 m Interest and overhead ----------- 94 m total Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

This time hes managed the trick by bringing two cyborgs back from the future into the sort-of present (the math doesnt quite work out) to respectively menace and defend the juvenile John Connor (Edward Furlong) - leader of the human resistance against machines that rule the war devastated world of 2029. As with Aliens director James Cameron has again taken a firstrate science fiction film and crafted a sequel thats in some ways more impressive - expanding on the original rather than merely remaking it.

Arnold Schwarzenegger is more comfortable and assured here than the first time around reprising a role so perfectly suited to the voice and physique that have established him as a larger-than-life film persona. The story finds Connor living with foster parents his mother Sarah (Linda Hamilton) having been captured and committed to an asylum for insisting on the veracity of events depicted in the first film. The machines who rule the future dispatch a new cyborg to slay him while the human resistance sends its own reprogrammed Terminator back - this one bearing a remarkable resemblance to the evil one that appeared in 1984. The films great innovation involves the second cyborg an advanced model composed of a liquid metal alloy that can metamorphose into the shape of any person it contacts and sprout metal appendages to skewer its victims. Script by Cameron and William Wisher at times gets lost amid all the carnage. Hamiltons heavy-handed narration also is at times unintentionally amusing though through her Cameron again offers the sci-fi crowd a fiercely heroic female lead albeit one who looks like shes been going to Madonnas physical trainer. If the reported 100 million budget is a study in excess at least a lot of it ended up on the screen.

Comments Terminator 2 Judgment Day Rated R  136 minutes  1991 James Camerons slam-bang 1991 sequel-cum-remake brings back Arnold Schwarzenegger as another killing machine from the future. This time his mission isnt to kill the heroine (Linda Hamilton) but to protect her son (Edward Furlong) from an even more high-tech killing machine (Robert Patrick). To spice things up Schwarzenegger is dressed as a biker and Patrick as a cop the latter displaying quicksilver capacities that hark back to the friendly alien force in The Abyss. All the virtues of the original--intelligent postmodernist irony spiffy special effects effective action tons of destruction and Schwarzenegger in the nonhuman role he was born to play--are present here though when Cameron tries to milk some sentiment out of the ""personality"" and fate of his top machine he comes up flat and empty and the other characters are scarcely more interesting. As a fancy mechanism fueled by the pleasure of watching legions of people and equipment being summarily destroyed this is pretty hot stuff. Written by Cameron in collaboration with William Wisher.

In 1984 director-writer James Cameron gave Arnold Schwarzenegger the role of his career as a killer cyborg sent from the future to murder Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) before she gives birth to a son who will lead a revolt against the ruling army of machines. ""Ill be back"" said Schwarzenegger. Now he is back but reprogrammed as a goody-goody to protect Sarahs son John Connor played by fourteen-year-old Edward Furlong. The bad Terminator (Robert Patrick) is a newer model -- a hunk of liquid metal in human form (he looks like an Oscar with ears) -- out to waste John and clear the way for nuclear war on August 29th 1997.

Schwarzenegger has fun saying things like ""Chill out dickwad"" and ""Hasta la vista baby."" But the stars quips are predictable the stock in trade of an icon for hire. Its Camerons show; hes the reigning king of movie pow with dark wit and a poets eye for mayhem. T2 cost a reported 100 million and you can actually see where the money went. The visual and makeup effects are state-of-the-art making Terminator 2 the big-daddy action entertainment of the summer. Still the films relentless pummeling grows wearying at 135 minutes. The first Terminator a half-hour shorter was leaner and meaner. Cameron and co-writer William Wisher saddle the game Hamilton with too many rants about peace. Cameron is not skilled at preaching (a similar moral stance marred the climax of The Abyss). And the good Terminators cornball farewell feels out of place for Schwarzenegger and the film. Its the equivalent of making a sequel to The Silence of the Lambs in which Hannibal the Cannibal becomes a vegetarian.

"Terminator 2 Judgment Day (R) This movie won Oscars for Best Makeup; Visual Effects Editing; Sound; and Sound Effects Editing. Terminator 2 Judgment Day (R) By Hal Hinson Washington Post Staff Writer July 03 1991 James Camerons ""Terminator 2 Judgment Day"" is a lustrous machine all gleaming steel and burnished gunmetal with state-of-the-art nuts and bolts. You relate to it the way you might relate to any overpowering machine a little dispassionately but with a respect bordering on awe. Its a tank of a movie big powerful and hard to resist. But its a tank with lightning treads and jaguar agility. The stunning special effects show something thats rare these days -- technical stunts that evoke a true sense of wonder; its real jaw-to-the-floor stuff. As a sequel ""Terminator 2"" is more imposing than its predecessor and it lacks the B-movie modesty of the original. The original ""Terminator"" was science fiction with an element of shaggy poetry; this ""Terminator"" strives more for the mythic. Its heroic pulp. The circumstances of the two are similar. Once again two warriors have been beamed from the future back to our time and once again one warrior must protect the subject that the other was sent to destroy. In this case the Terminators mission is to kill John Connor (Edward Furlong) the young son of Sarah (Linda Hamilton) so that he cannot grow up to become the great leader of the resistance that he would after the world has been blown to bits in a nuclear conflagration. The boys protector in this second film is another T-800 Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) like the cyborg that combined machine and living tissue that was sent to kill his mother 10 years ago. The T-800s adversary this time out is a more sophisticated version of himself the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) which is made from a kind of liquid metal -- a ""mimetic polyalloy"" its called -- that allows it to change shape at will and renders it virtually indestructible. The T-1000 is a sleeker faster version of the earlier Terminator -- it plays cat to Schwarzeneggers raging bull -- but it has its predecessors single-mindedness. The movie exists on a very basic level; its one long chase in which the new Terminator tries to get the boy away from the older one. The film sets up a monumental battle of the Titans and it doesnt disappoint. The confrontations between these two unstoppable forces are thrilling death bouts between equally matched gladiators. As they hammer each other the outcome of the fight seems genuinely uncertain. But the films real virtues emerge in its quieter moments when the characters are given a chance to interact. The subtext here is much richer than in the first; its a movie about family and finding a father. When the Terminator is on the run with Sarah and John he becomes the strong patriarchal figure at the center of their makeshift nuclear family. The roles in this family-during-wartime though are hilariously reversed. Its the kid who teaches the father how to cope in the world how to use slang like ""chill"" and ""no problemo"" how to ""give five"" and more important how to feel. John also teaches his surrogate dad a grudging respect for human life which further contributes to the films new age spirit. Its this element that is most unique and most satisfying -- that and the richness Schwarzenegger brings to his character. Its comical perhaps but Schwarzenegger expresses more of his own humanity when playing a machine than he does when playing real people. Hes a hopelessly wooden actor but that artificiality and his ""Fun With Phonics"" style of delivery is perfect for his character here and perfect for the films deadpan sense of humor. For once hes ideally cast and he brings the kind of delicacy of feeling that Boris Karloff showed as the Frankenstein monster. As a machine he has soul. Unfortunately the other Terminator doesnt and thats one of this movies biggest problems. Unlike in the first film theres no one to identify with on the other side. The effects for this character however are smashing too. Cameron manages to create a neat balance between the technical and the human here; so much so that this surfaces as one of the movies themes. Most of the actors make strong statements including Hamilton whos Nautilused herself into the form of a modern-day Diana and Furlong who gives one of the loosest performances for a child actor ever filmed. As the brain behind SkyNet the computer that goes out of control and causes the nuclear nightmare Joe Morton also makes the most of a few minutes on screen. No one in the movies today can match Camerons talent for this kind of hyperbolic big-screen action. Cameron who directed the first ""Terminator"" and ""Aliens"" doesnt just slam us over the head with the action. In staging the movies gigantic set pieces he has an eye for both grandeur and beauty; he possesses that rare directors gift for transforming the objects he shoots so that we see for example the lyrical muscularity of an 18-wheel truck. Because of Cameron the movie is the opposite of its Terminator character; its a machine with a human heart.

Terminator 2 Judgment Day Movie Review (1991) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/terminator-2-judgment-day-1991,200,terminator2judgmentday16,terminator2judgmentday,rogerebert
"Terminator 2 Judgment Day (R) This movie won Oscars for Best Makeup; Visual Effects Editing; Sound; Sound Effects Editing. Terminator 2 Judgment Day (R) By Joe Brown Washington Post Staff Writer July 05 1991 Brutally beautiful darkly comic sci-fi ""Terminator 2 Judgment Day"" is guaranteed to destroy the feeble competition and conquer the world this summer. Visceral to the point of overkill (and beyond) a berserk blizzard of kinetic images it doesnt even give you time to be scared. And even though ""T2"" stars Arnold Schwarzenegger its not just another chrome-plated casual carnage flick. ""T2"" has a humane message; in fact its even Politically Correct in a perverse way. Heres a techno-movie that is virulently anti-technology; that deploys mega-violence to make a statement about the value of human life; that is macho in the extreme but has a female sensibility at heart. And it has Arnold. Just try and stop it. As we survey the scorched metal graveyard that is Los Angeles circa 2029 a solemn voice-over brings us up to date since the first ""Terminator"" Intelligent computers began the nuclear war that wiped out 3 billion lives on Aug. 29 1997. Those few unlucky humans who survived were left to face a far fiercer enemy than men -- the malevolent machines we created. But it doesnt have to end that way The human resistance is led by John Connor who reprogrammed the original Terminator -- a titanic Teutonic cyborg with a metal robot skeleton beneath its flesh-and-blood exterior -- and sent it back in time to protect himself as a young boy. And Johns mother Sarah (wiry hellcat Linda Hamilton who outdoes Sigourney ""Aliens"" Weaver in Ultimate Overprotective Mom mode) is determined to change the future by ""terminating"" a scientist who bases his ultra-advanced weapons technology on a microchip left behind during the first ""Terminators"" earthly visit thus unwittingly designing the doom of mankind. So this time when Schwarzenegger materializes in a parking lot in a blaze of blue lightning hes a good guy sort of sent to protect young John Connor a 12-year-old mall rat. After John (chipper androgynous Edward Furlong) learns this frightening father-figure has to obey his orders (""Cool My own Terminator"") he gradually humanizes the implacable Terminator teaching him about mores and emotions (""I will not kill anybody"" he promises John after one such lesson -- instead he just maims them for life). He also gives the Terminator a crash course in teen slang which provides Schwarzenegger with the raft of drop-dead deadpan one-liners kids will be repeating all summer. But the robots have also sent a Terminator back in time -- the T-1000 more advanced more deadly even than Arnold (hes just a T-800) -- on a mission to terminate kid Connor. Blond bland all-American-looking Robert Patrick plays the T-1000 who moves about in an L.A. cops uniform. Relentless and almost invincible the T-1000 is made of ""liquid metal"" so hes self-healing and capable of quicksilver metamorphoses into anything hes made contact with. The collision of these two dueling near-indestructible man-machines at large in Los Angeles leads to fight scenes like youve never seen. Director and co-screenwriter James Cameron has the framing eye of a great comic-book artist and a bracingly sick sense of humor -- he wittily borrows from the surrealistic hallucinations of ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" the paranoia of ""Silence of the Lambs"" -- and even indulges in a clever reversal of the melting Wicked Witch scene from ""The Wizard of Oz."" Budgeted in excess of 90 million (""T1"" cost a mere 6 million) ""T2"" is the most expensive movie ever made and Cameron puts it all on screen -- the makeup special effects and especially the harrowing chase scenes (a 14-wheeler truck chases a dirt bike through the L.A. flood-control channels; a helicopter buzzes a SWAT van on the L.A. freeway) redefine ""spectacular."" And of course there are dozens of satisfying explosions including a horrifyingly vivid envisioning of a nuclear holocaust. After the techno-frenzy of Schwarzeneggers ""Total Recall"" audiences wondered how anyone could top that films special effects and epic body count. Now youve gotta be afraid of the movie that tries to outdo ""Terminator 2.""

"Terminator 2 Judgment Day | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; terminator-2-judgment-day ) Terminator 2 Judgment Day (United States 1991) May 09 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli When James Cameron crafted The Terminator in 1984 the concept of a sequel was far from his thoughts. The films box office performance while more than justifying the movies understated 6.5 million budget did not result in studio executives rushing to Cameron to make a follow-up. However The Terminator arrived on tape just as the mid-80s home video revolution was gathering steam and it became one of a few titles whose VHS success oustripped its theatrical performance. By the late 1980s there was no question that Cameron would make a Terminator sequel. The only mystery was how spectacular it would be. Aliens Camerons first big-budget directorial assignment had been an edge-of-the-seat ride and indications were that he had every intention of topping it with Terminator 2. (In between Aliens and T2 Cameron made The Abyss a film plagued by production issues that received a lukewarm initial reception but was re-evaluated once a more complete version of the directors vision was released for home viewing.) At the core of The Terminator lies the concept of time travel with machines from the future returning to the past in an attempt to change it while future humans sought to retain the status quo. For Terminator 2 Cameron changed the game. Once again there are pro-human and anti-human factions tripping through time but on this occasion both sides have the same eventual goal change the future. For Sarah Connor (an ultra-toned Linda Hamilton) and her 10-year old son John (Edward Furlong) its a chance to avert the coming apocalypse. However for the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) the latest machine weapon the mission is to kill the Connors. With those two eliminated the future human resistance will be toothless thereby assuring eventual machine dominance. For T2 Camerons planed ""major twist"" was unveiled before the movies release because of marketing considerations. This time Arnold Schwarzenegger would portray a good Terminator instead of a bad one. Had this been kept a secret it would have packed a wallop. Unfortunately the trailers let the cat out of the bag and few (if any) members of the audience were unaware of this switch-up. Knowing the twist beforehand neither ruins the overall movie-going experience nor damages its integrity but its not unlike being aware of the identity of Lukes father while watching The Empire Strikes Back. With the hulking Schwarzenegger at the height of his cinematic popularity in 1991 playing the heroic figure someone else was needed to assume the villains mantle. Since it would have been foolish to attempt to out-bulk Schwarzenegger Cameron opted instead to make the T-1000 the picture of ordinariness. In fact based on the storys original conception the T-1000 would have been played by Michael Biehn (Kyle Reese in The Terminator) making the role reversal symmetrical. Fearing audience confusion however Cameron abandoned this idea and offered the part to Robert Patrick. The T-1000s seeming physical inferiority is more than compensated for by the unique nature of its construction. It is a creature of ""living metal"" capable of re-forming into almost any shape of equal mass and virtually indestructible. With the T-1000 T2 became the first motion picture to make significant use of the then-new CGI technology that Cameron had pioneered in The Abyss. In the wake of T2 CGI would become an increasingly used staple of special effects-heavy motion pictures with 1993s Jurassic Park taking it to the next level. T2 features bigger bolder more energetic action sequences than its predecessor (Cameron had a budget of more than ten times that of the original for the sequel). The big moments include a chase scene in which the T-1000 in a truck pursues John Connor and his Terminator on a motorcycle; the prison break of Sarah Connor; and the explosive finale at Cyberdyne. The film is long enough to allow for more character development than in the original. We come to understand how her obsession with the future has transformed Sarah into a driven woman. A touching friendship develops between John and The Terminator lending aspects of an off beat ""buddy movie"" to T2. And Miles Dyson (Joe Morton) the scientist/engineer unlocking the secrets of the 1984 Terminators chip must face the moral and ethical implications of what he is inadvertently doing. By trying to help mankind is he instead becoming the author of its genocide? The time paradoxes addressed in this film are more complex than those in The Terminator. This storyline postulates that actions from the future have formed a cornerstone of the past raising questions about the non-linear nature of time. Camerons original ending for T2 would have made future sequels unlikely; producer Mario Kassar forced Cameron to abandon his planned ""coda"" to allow for the possibility of additional Terminator movies. Thus far there have been two (plus a television series) but Cameron has not been involved claiming the story he wanted to tell concluded at the end of T2. T2 opens with two Terminators arriving in 1995 through separate time portals. The nuclear cataclysm caused by Skynets gaining awareness is barely more than two years in the future. The ""superior"" Terminator the T-1000 has made the trip to ensure that nothing impedes Skynets development and that John and Sarah Connor are terminated. The ""inferior"" Terminator a ""series 800 model 101"" has been sent back through time by the future John Connor to safeguard his mother and past self. The idea of destroying Cyberdyne and averting the bleak future is not part of his original mission but is decided upon by Sarah after her son and his Terminator free her from the psychiatric hospital where she is being confined. Theres a little more humor in T2 than there was in The Terminator. Most of it results from the interaction between John and the Terminator where the human child attempts to teach the robot killer the intricacies of offhand social interaction. This includes slang expressions such as ""Hasta la vista baby."" Its also worth noting that although it would be a stretch to call Schwarzeneggers Terminator ""kinder and gentler"" in this film he does not kill anyone. Even before John explicitly orders him not to commit murder the Terminators visit to the past lacks a body count. (The same cannot be said of the T-1000.) Of course injury intimidation property damage and general mayhem are exempted. Although the theatrical version of the film clocked in at 137 minutes the most commonly viewed home video version is the extended directors cut which adds about 15 minutes of additional footage and the new scenes do not impede the breakneck pace. Perhaps the most notable of the inclusions is a dream sequence in which Sarah interacts with Kyle Reese. This sequence - the only one in T2 featuring Michael Biehn - provides stronger connective tissue between The Terminator and its immediate sequel. Combined the first two Terminator movies offer some of the best contemporary-based science fiction action ever provided in a motion picture series. Although the third Terminator movie continues the legacy of impressive big budget action the screenplay is lacking in both depth and substance and it feels inferior especially when viewed back-to-back with Camerons efforts. Although The Terminator is arguably the more visionary of the first two films T2 is the more visually and viscerally satisfying. Its an exhausting experience and even 18 years after its release (as I write this review) few films have matched it within the science fiction genre for sheer white-knuckle exhilaration.
