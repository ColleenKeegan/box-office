"Remembering an Olympic Tragedy washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Remembering an Olympic Tragedy ""One Day in September"" details the 1972 Munich Olympics crisis when terrorists took hostage and killed 11 Israeli team members. (Sony Pictures Home Entertainment) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 23 2005 Steven Spielbergs ""Munich"" (see review on Page 32) opens with a brief prologue sketching out in only the barest detail the events of Sept. 5 1972 when Palestinian terrorists took hostage -- and ultimately murdered -- 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team during the Munich Olympics. Throughout the course of the fact-based film which follows the Israeli agents tasked with hunting down and terminating the planners of the attack the tragedy is recalled in harrowing flashback sequences. For filmgoers interested in a bit more background on the crisis which riveted the world but incredibly did not stop the games Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has just dusted off two earlier films on the subject. The better of the two is ""One Day in September"" (R 19.94) a rerelease of the Academy Award-winning 1999 documentary by Kevin Macdonald that meticulously analyzes the attack by the group known as Black September. In the light of hindsight what comes across most clearly is that the botched rescue attempt was largely the fault of the Germans who were not only unprepared but refused to accept an offer of experienced Israeli military assistance. For those who wont watch documentaries definitive or otherwise -- and you know who you are -- you could do a whole heck of a lot worse than the feature ""21 Hours at Munich"" (Unrated 19.94) a 1976 made-for-TV alternative starring William Holden as Munich Police Chief Manfred Schreiber and Franco Nero as the terrorist leader called Issa. Based on the book ""The Blood of Israel"" by Serge Groussard and shot almost entirely on location in the Munich Olympic Village in an eerily dispassionate quasi-documentary style ""21 Hours"" isnt half bad especially for TV fare. Although it places less explicit blame on Schreiber and the Germans it is nevertheless a faithful and unsentimental reenactment of history. Whats more though less bloody than Spielbergs film it comes across as surprisingly brutal even by 1976 television standards. Its true that the fake blood effects all too often look like red paint and one or two histrionic death scenes mar the films cool detachment but its an honest and well-made time capsule. Like Spielbergs film if to a lesser degree it also deserves credit for refusing to depict the bad guys as faceless monsters though they are clearly very very bad guys. Yes Holdens Schreiber calls Issa a ""beast"" but a subdued Nero lays off the ham and cheese in what is while unsympathetic an ultimately humanizing performance of an enemy of the Jews who as it turns out was himself half Jewish.

Daphna (Ayelet Zurer) indulgently moans at the husband (Eric Bana) who has dashed across a continent to her bedside for their firstborns arrival. Its an odd question to hear in a Spielberg film and an even odder context given the apparently compulsive idolatry of the family that runs through his films. Yet in Munich he acknowledges that the defence of the family and home can yield destruction perhaps evil. Following Palestinian terrorists massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics Banas Avner is recruited to head up a Mossad assassination squad (including Ciaran Hinds Daniel Craig and Mathieu Kassovitz) targeting those deemed responsible. But as they kill their way around Europe in a series of meticulously executed set-pieces he begins to question whether such retribution can really promote catharsis let alone peace. The unobjectionable moral - violence begets violence - is illustrated by geddit? dramatic ironies (hunter becomes hunted) and gross violence (one targets limbs are left dangling from hotel furnishings); if the squad ape the terrorists unaccountability and invisibility Spielberg recognises the appeal of homicidal spectaculars. The idea of Munich as the dawn of media terrorism plays into the intriguing ambiguous context in which the film locates its action. It posits the siege and Israels response (personified in Lynn Cohens steely Golda Meir) as a geopolitical bridge between Holocaust and jihad while giving space to a young Palestinians insistence that home is everything and that the struggle will continue through children yet unborn - a motif mirrored in Avners own family life. Who could have expected Spielberg of all directors to twin the reproductive cycle with the cycle of violence?

Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Munich"" with Eric Bana Daniel Craig Ciaran Hinds Mathieu Kassovitz Hanns Zischler Ayelet Zurer Geoffrey Rush. Directed by Steven Spielberg from a screenplay by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth based on the book ""Vengeance"" by George Jonas. 160 minutes. Rated R for strong graphic violence some sexual content nudity and language. Several theaters. In ""Munich"" Steven Spielbergs gritty story of men murder and vengeance two of the most powerful moments involve beautiful dark-eyed little girls. In one a planned apartment bombing is interrupted at the last minute when the would-be victims young daughter skips back into her home unexpectedly. The resultant commotion as the hit men scramble to stop what they have put into motion is meticulously choreographed and devastatingly real; watching it you forget to breathe. And later in the film a young man named Avner (Eric Bana) aged before his time is reunited with the daughter he barely knows. Shes an enchanting toddler her face wreathed in curls and he races to her as if shes a magnet. Spielbergs films so often deal with themes of parenthood and he knows how to convey that bond without a word. Earlier weve seen Avner speaking to his infant on the phone; she gurgles ""da-da"" and his face crumbles weeping. The child is his anchor his reason in a world where reason sometimes seems very far away. ""Munich"" written by Pultizer Prize-winning playwright Tony Kushner (""Angels in America"") and Eric Roth tells a complex harrowing story inspired by real events. In September 1972 at the Summer Olympic Games in Munich a group of Palestinian terrorists killed 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team. Spielbergs film sketches in this tragedy in its first few minutes mixing real footage (ABC sports broadcaster Jim McKay dark circles under his eyes narrated the unfolding story) with meticulous bone-chilling dramatization. Its over quickly and we hear the names of the victims interspersed with the names of the killers. And then the real story of ""Munich"" begins. ""Forget peace for now"" says Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen an uncanny ringer) her eyes unblinking. She and the members of a secret committee appoint five men for a hellish mission to find and kill the 11 men behind the Munich murders. The chosen hit men are Avner Steve (Daniel Craig) Hans (Hanns Zischler) Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz) and Carl (Ciaran Hinds). Each has a specific skill to contribute Robert is a bombmaker; Hans a forger. Each has ambivalent feelings about his assignment but each agrees to take it on for reasons never entirely clear. From here ""Munich"" unfolds moving from city to city and from name to name on the hit list. The group of five dwindles; this is a dangerous assignment and not all survive. And the film though made with great sincerity and artistry becomes increasingly remote. Spielbergs great strength as a filmmaker is his humanity his ability to show us those connections between people that make us whole. Here he spreads that humanity to practically everyone in the movie. Its a courageous choice in the light of this politically charged story but one that challenges its audience to find a way in. Made in a hurry ""Munich"" was filmed just this past summer and rushed through production. Sometimes that speed seems to benefit the movie Theres a jagged on-the-fly energy to it like the best of 70s cinema. But the characters perhaps werent thoroughly thought out; its hard to connect to anyone here even Banas often enigmatic Avner. Spielberg with longtime director of photography Janusz Kaminski creates some pictures as vivid as any in his career. One of Avner is an uncanny echo of the famous photograph from the 1972 Olympics of a stocking-capped sniper on a balcony. In another a man is gunned down in his apartment lobby; as steam rises from his lifeless body a pool of milk spreads from his dropped groceries puddling as it mingles with his blood. Ultimately there is no peace for Avner and no answers in ""Munich"" -- just as the real story remains elusive. Its a smart mesmerizing and often angry film from a truly confident filmmaker but it remains maddeningly just beyond our grasp. We connect to it in moments such as those with the children and then it slips away; dark as a nightmare with no promise of light.

Munich is an amoral look at men on a deadly mission. 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Munich Drama. Starring Eric Bana Daniel Craig and Ciaran Hinds. Directed by Steven Spielberg. (R. 167 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Steven Spielbergs ""Munich"" is an unlovable movie. Its morally ambiguous which means theres no real rooting interest. Its episodic with the same kinds of episodes repeated over and over so theres little sense of forward motion. It feels philosophically and politically confused so theres no message to take from it and it doesnt have a single movie star in the cast unless you count Eric Bana. Yet everything that keeps it from being lovable could be looked upon as a virtue and everything about it is intentional. Moreover the episodes in and of themselves are compelling and though the movie runs 167 minutes it never drags. It ends precisely as it should end with an extended shot that says more with one image than ever could have been said with dialogue. In the Spielberg filmography ""Munich"" may go down as something along the order of Hitchcocks ""Topaz"" another chilly well-made historically based suspense drama made as a response to the madness of the world situation. Spielbergs film deals with the aftermath of the 1972 Munich Olympics in which 11 Israeli athletes were murdered by Palestinian terrorists. A Mossad agent Avner (Bana) is given a budget a staff and instructions to track down and assassinate every Arab terrorist involved in the Munich attack and we follow him and his associates as they go around Europe killing people. The films episodic structure derives from the nature of Avners assignment. At each juncture he gets a name and a location plans a killing and carries it out. At first this begins to seem like a grim version of the old ""Chorus Line"" structure in which the story can move only laterally from dancer to dancer or in this case from corpse to corpse. While technically suspenseful these scenes lack any galvanizing emotion since Spielberg and screenwriters Tony Kushner and Eric Roth have no stomach for Avners mission. People will argue whether this is politically wrong right or just confused but theres no arguing about the effect of ambivalence on drama. It weakens it. Yet gradually Spielbergs strategy emerges. He depicts an endless maze of tension and violence and makes it feel suffocating by placing the viewer in the midst of it. Spielberg couldnt care less about the mission the men are on but he cares about what the mission is doing to them. Thus we get scenes of them arguing the moral points of revenge and assassination as a shorthand way of establishing and tracking the changes in their personalities. Daniel Craig (the next James Bond) plays an instinctive man not plagued by conscience a natural soldier; Ciaran Hinds an intellectual doubter; Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz) a sensitive artist disguised as a bomb maker; and Hanns Zischler a seemingly emotionless killer whose facade cracks after a particularly pathetic episode involving the shooting of a frivolous female assassin. The conversations between Avner and his men seem schematic done more for our benefit than theirs. For all the screenwriters straining the only character to emerge with any complexity is Avner himself. His confusion is Spielbergs confusion. Its the civilized persons confusion. Should he take ""an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth"" to the point where no one has any eyes or teeth? If not whats the alternative in combating terrorists? Doing nothing? In a truthful and decidedly non-movie star way -- Bana traces the progress of a man from assurance to doubt from an easy conscience to haunted dreams from someone with the glint of youth and enthusiasm in his eyes to one who can see only death. The future will pronounce on ""Munich"" in a way that it will not pronounce on ""Rumor Has It"" or any of the other movies opening this holiday weekend. No one will remember the others but ""Munich"" will be looked to as a popular document from early in Americas terrorism struggle. Future events are sure to determine the films ultimate meaning but in assessing its ultimate importance and value it would be a mistake for any present or future critic to denigrate ""Munich"" for its philosophical inconsistency its muddled politics or its mix of impulses. Like ""Heroes for Sale"" a 1933 film made in the heart of the Depression that was all over the map ideologically ""Munich"" captures the bewilderment of its historical moment. Its an emotional film disguised as a thoughtful film an artfully executed wail of frustration. As such its the most complete post-Sept. 11 time capsule since Spike Lees ""25th Hour."" One final note Spielberg begins the film with excerpts from ABCs original live coverage of the Munich slayings. I had a childhood recollection that Jim McKay known as a sports announcer did an exceptional job anchoring those broadcasts. Its nice to have that memory confirmed. -- Advisory Lots of strong language nudity and violence -- sometimes in the same scene.

"Spielberg on terrorism revenge and the violence that never ends - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Terrorism Spielberg on terrorism revenge and the violence that never endsreviewDecember 23 2005|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie CriticMunich. We know what happened there in 1972. Many of us remember Jim McKay sitting at that ABC Sports desk intoning those fateful words ""Theyre all gone.""But what we dont know is what happened afterward the reprisals for the act of terrorism that slaughtered 11 Israeli athletes at the Olympics. And we almost certainly dont see what happened there as part of a continuum the vicious cycle of terrorism and reprisals that connect the dots all the way to 9-11.Munich is Steven Spielbergs sincere effort to wrap his Hollywood arms around terrorism. Its also a heavy movie about a grim subject that Olympic massacre and the Israeli assassination squad that went out to punish those responsible.Its riveting. But its a thriller with a conscience. ""When"" Spielberg asks ""does it end?"" Where is the finish line when youre trapped in a circle of bombings political ""hits"" and murder?But its also awfully glib. The director who played around with our memories of 9-11 with his War of the Worlds has made a grisly movie about the ugly business of government-sanctioned murder. He has also made an entertaining one with thrills suspense and light moments.And then he makes us feel guilty about it all in the finale. Yes we want revenge. Yes were sure were entitled. And here it is 33 years after most of this happened and were still stuck in the same trap.Eric Bana stars as the Israeli secret agent commissioned to lead four other men into deep cover in Europe to kill 11 Palestinians whom the Israeli government says were linked to the attack.He leaves behind his pregnant wife and gets a pep talk from Prime Minister Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen a bit off) and orders from a prickly control agent (Geoffrey Rush superb). Hes assigned a driver (future Bond Daniel Craig) a bomb-maker (Mathieu Kassovitz) a document-forger (Hanns Zischler) and a ""cleaner"" the agent who can clean up their messes (Ciaran Hinds terrific). And they go to work.A bomb in a phone here under a mattress there. A poet and supposed PLO operative gunned down. Men with families killed in front of those families.Assassination by assassination first one then another of the killers starts to fret over what theyre doing some for moral reasons others out of sheer paranoia. When youre on the lam and a murderer whom can you trust?The great Michael Lonsdale who once played a French cop who chased ""The Jackal"" shows up here as a seen-it-all French Godfather whose family trade is helping out or selling out terrorists from the alphabet of terror -- the IRA the ANC ETA or PLO. Its one of the standout turns in an ensemble movie whose peripheral players make a better impression than the lead (Bana).The movies make it seem so easy. A silencer easily obtained; a gun easily used; a life snuffed out with no more than a stoic grimace from the hit-man ""hero."" Plastic explosives? Off the shelf in the movies. But how does somebody learn to make these clever perfect little bombs? Arent there ever accidents? Yes Munich shows us there are. Dont the killers go a little nuts doing what they do? Yes as Munich shows us they do.Munich gets into the seemingly mundane logistics of running a ""hit squad."" Safe houses have to be found. Explosives are hard to procure. The Israelis have to use WWII vintage grenades at one point. The gear and men who use it arent Hollywood glamorous. No shiny metal briefcases with exotic weapons seen only in the movies here.An unspoken message of this Tony Kushner script -- he wrote Angels in America and adapted this from the book Vengeance -- is what a distressingly dangerous place the world was even in the ordered universe of the Cold War. So many factions so many terrorists.Are we safer now? Not because of anything these guys and their comrades did.Its a tricky sermon and Spielberg hides the preaching well until the third act. Whatever his other motives he plainly lost himself in the spycraft the mechanics of planning murders the prettiness of the violence (blood spreading out through spilled milk a naked woman artfully ""plugged""). The entertainer in him makes the history go down easy.Munich is only based on true events and has much that is fictional (theres a lot of evidence that they killed the wrong guys). But that doesnt obscure the greater truth that the killings on both sides arent solving anything ""over there.""Like the superior Syriana this isnt a Middle Eastern tale that offers much hope. Its just bloodstained history. And if we dont remember that history Spielberg says we learn nothing.

Those events are indisputable They were documented live on international television in the days before CNN and 24/7 global news coverage. But Steven Spielbergs Munich isnt concerned too much with those initial murders in the summer of 1972. They matter only as a springboard a tragic motivator in a difficult and challenging film that explores the cost of violence -- and the yearning for nationhood -- on both sides of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Munich looks past Munich into the deep reflecting pools of post-World War II Jewish identity. While Schindlers List memorialized and summarized the Holocaust as the defining cataclysm for Jews in the 20th century this new film shies from moral certitude. Theres no closure here no firm resolution or resigned philosophizing. And unlike a lot of Spielbergs work it ends as it should end i.e. without a slapped-on saccharine coda. For once the director is content to leave unsettled questions hanging asked but not answered -- questions of terrorism and the behavior of states that have already stirred controversy and are likely to as long as a print of the film exists. But this debate is the point of Munich. Set in the aftermath of those Israeli deaths the action follows Avner Kauffman (Eric Bana) a Mossad agent sent to track down and systematically assassinate every last Palestinian involved in the Olympic murders. An early scene shows Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen) with her advisers mulling the need to strike back with equal and opposite outrage. Every civilization she says must compromise its own principles in times of extraordinary conflict. Toward that end Avner and a cohort of specialists (played by Ciaran Hinds Daniel Craig Mathieu Kassovitz and Hanns Zischler) go underground in Europe and ferret out their targets with the help of a steely superior (Geoffrey Rush) and a dodgy French intelligence peddler (Mathieu Amalric) of obscure motivation. Angels in America playwright Tony Kushner and co-screenwriter Eric Roth grant each character totemic weight allowing every viewpoint a carefully scripted voice. Some equate Israels actions with those of the terrorists themselves. Others uphold the right- eousness of the Jewish state and the necessity confirmed by the Holocaust to give the diaspora a permanent refuge. Across the board the films performances are sinewy and tough elastic enough to bend with misgivings. Banas is a sum of fine adjustments in resolve Gradually almost imperceptibly the stolid Mossad agent falls apart. His breakdown and the films larger complexities are captured by longtime Spielberg collaborator Janusz Kaminski whose oxymoronic photography is hard and ethereal merciless and soft. The upshot is shattering -- a graphic sepulchral film thats tough to watch running with blood and a current of doubt. Its suspenseful but I would hardly call it a thriller any more than Id call Schindlers List a biopic. I simply felt sick with dread. Its a technically mesmerizing death march in the manner of Saving Private Ryan except the violence is personal and the enemy has a face Each target is humanized however slightly before he dies. In one surreal nocturne Avner and a young Arab smoke on a stairwell arguing the need for home -- Israels and Palestines. A friend of mine who lives in Jerusalem once observed that he couldnt see a way toward peace in Israel but hes certain it will come -- for no other reason than that it has to. War will end eventually. Munich merely argues that it must. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals 4-Panel Abstract Wall Art by Jon Allen for 145 + free shipping Defiant LED Flashlight 3-Pack for 10 + pickup at Home Depot Tamrac 28"" ZipShot Mini Compact Camera Tripod for 10 + free...

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post In the terrorism drama ""Munich"" Steven Spielberg proposes a debate and promptly loses it. The story of the slaughter of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics seemed a perfect opportunity for a director of Spielbergs stature to take on political violence and give us a point of view. Not only did the PLO use the horrific event to make an infamous name for itself but Israels Mossad spent the next few years hunting down Palestinian targets and assassinating them as a revenge message. Adding clear references to the World Trade Center attack and Abu Ghraib ""Munich"" sets us up for a vital commentary on our own fearful times. The first 10 minutes briefly scratches that itch. Spielberg unspools the hostage-taking in the Olympic village with chilling speed amplified through real news footage and Jim McKays distinctive shocked narration. Spielberg rubs us raw leaving us wounded and expectant. Then he flinches. ""Munich"" quickly becomes a buddy-thriller where a band of oddballs launches a crime caper that just happens to involve cold-blooded murder and world politics. Spielberg is so good at moving action forward he forgets - and so do we for a while - that were not supposed to root wholeheartedly for the Mossad posse. This is not The Magnificent Seven. As we now know its killing that begets killing that begets everything from refugee camps to Sept. 11. When Spielberg does remember the enormity of the debate he launched his solutions feel stop-gap and misdirected. Two of the key killers face off in a stairwell and hold a high- school-level argument about revenge and futility. Soon enough its back to the action. The rest of the morality dialogue is all on the Israeli side. The Mossad assassins question their tactics and goals yet were never given the satisfaction of hearing Palestinians argue among themselves and condemn each other for cruelty. Our vehicle through Spielbergs maze of terrorism is Eric Bana as Mossad agent Avner Kauffman. Hes a desk jockey when the Olympic killings begin reassuring his pregnant wife in Israel that he has ""the worlds most boring job."" But when Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen) calls a good Jew puts down the paperwork and picks up the Uzi. Meir and her lieutenants show Kauffman a set of 11 photos of Palestinians and sympathizers allegedly involved in the Olympic killings. They will be eliminated one by one. Thats when screenwriters Tony Kushner and Eric Roth give us a tantalizing glimpse at how poignant Spielbergs movie could have been if the mood were sustained. Meir explains to a stunned Kauffman ""Every civilization finds it necessary to compromise with its own values."" Hmmm. Might that have resonance beyond the 1970s? Bana is up to the task of a troubled gunman. He assembles a team and they skate through Europes capitals on their own mission of terror. Soon though the action depends too much on cheesy conversations among sophisticated criminals the kind more appropriate for ""Ronin"" or ""Oceans Eleven"" than a major directors treatise on terror. Kauffman ends up buying all his useful information from a shady family led by ""Ronins"" Michael Lonsdale. Their smirking conversations and garden parties are not only tiresome theyre pulled straight from ""The Godfather."" Spielberg prompts in us a sense of dread that could be instructive but winds up merely deflating. We know well have to witness killing after killing of anguished Palestinians often with their families. And because Spielberg flashes back in sequence to the slaughter of the Israeli athletes we know well wind up at the nightmarish final chaos at the Munich airport. Spielberg never shies from a graphic killing but he does shrink from any deeper meaning that would justify his images. ""Munich"" cant decide where to end so we get six or seven possible finishes each exhausting. A freakishly weird scene in which Kauffman tries to exorcise mental demons through pulverizing sex with his wife points up another Spielberg problem with women and intimacy. But thats another essay. The movie ends in Brooklyn where the camera lingers on the Twin Towers rising from the tip of Manhattan in their 1973 glory. Its a postcard shot though not an exclamation point for ""Munich"" hasnt taught us enough to give the sad skyscrapers more than a passing wave.

FACT BOXMunich Starring Eric Bana Geoffrey Rush Ciaran Hinds Mathieu Kassovitz Hanns Zischler Daniel Craig Directed by Steven Spielberg Written by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth Studio Universal YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Steven Spielberg Tony Kushner Movies or Create Your Own Manage Alerts | What Is This? (CNN) -- ""Munich"" is a masterpiece.The film directed by Steven Spielberg is a visceral emotionally exhausting work that dares to ask questions -- and gives no easy answers -- regarding the horrifying events that occurred at the 1972 Munich Olympics and their aftermath.That fall the entire world watched as an extremist Palestinian group Black September kidnapped and massacred Israels 1972 Olympic team. This was at an Olympics labeled ""The Olympics of Peace and Joy.""The deaths were played out in real time on television with the hostage drama culminating in a botched rescue mission at a nearby airport. Many historians point to Olympic tragedy as the beginning of the kind of worldwide terrorism we know today.First-time screenwriter (and Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright) Tony Kushner -- along with Eric Roth (""The Insider"") -- helped Spielberg fashion journalist George Jonas book ""Vengeance"" into a thriller that examines the power and psychological toll of violence and retribution.Publicly Israel responded to the Munich massacre by bombing Palestine Liberation Organization bases in Syria and Lebanon but privately the government under Prime Minister Golda Meir launched a highly top-secret group of special force teams to spread out across the world and assassinate all the Palestinians involved in the attack. The mission was called ""Operation Wrath of God.""""Munich"" is about one of those covert groups. Israel to this day has never confirmed the existence of these hit squads.Building tensionMuch of the action is seen through the eyes of one group leader Avner played by Eric Bana (""The Hulk"" ""Troy""). Geoffrey Rush plays Ephraim Avners contact who intercedes when the shell-shocked Avner begins to have questions -- questions that become more philosophical and demanding about the ethics of the mission.British actor Daniel Craig who has just been named the new James Bond plays Steve a South African who is the most unwavering of the group.Other members of the small group include Hans (Hanns Zischler) a German Jew who has a gift for forging documents; Carl (Ciaran Hinds) who is in charge of cleaning up the actions of his team; and Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz) a toymaker turned explosives expert.(One interesting bit of casting is Guri Weinberg now 33 who has a deep connection to the story -- he plays his own father. He is the son of Moshe Weinberg the Israeli wrestling referrer and former champion who died in the massacre when Guri was just 1 month old.)The hit team finds that the more they stay on the hunt the more likely they too will become the hunted. Indeed Avners main contact Louis (Mathieu Amalric) has no loyalties at all -- except to the money Avner pays him for his information. The idea can only make the men paranoid Avner -- with a wife and child and another life waiting for him -- most of all.""Munich"" veers between scenes of incredible tension -- one sequence in which the group accidentally finds the daughter of a target in their cross hairs is almost unbearably hard to watch -- and relaxed if meaningful conversation. At one point Avner blindfolded is taken to see Louis father a man who understands everybodys quandary -- but remains outside the fray the better to exploit it.Spielberg does not demonize the Palestinians nor make the Israelis into saints. Hes already taking heat from numerous groups on both sides of this fiery issue. (Watch how ""Munich"" is angering many -- and also receiving support -- 300)Indeed ""Munich"" deliberately walks a tightrope. Its full of clashes of tone and reason and offers no pat answers. All it does is humanize the story of some decent men who -- in the end -- must come face to face with their own souls. Thats plenty.Spielbergs directing is brilliant from Hitchcockian set pieces to jittery 70s-style movement. Kushner and Roths script is thoughtful and provocative. The acting is uniformly excellent.Near the end of the film Ephraim asks a weary Avner ""What have you learned?"" Ephraim wants to know about the mission but the same unwittingly loaded question could be asked of everybody.""Munich"" is a great film -- and an important one. Its a brave work from a top-notch filmmaker and one of the best films of the year.

Browse over 8 million products  Clothing amp; Jewelry  Computers amp; Electronics  Home amp; Garden  Kids amp; Family Highly charged Munich not typical Spielberg By Mike Clark USA TODAY Revenge isnt sweet or even satisfying to its perpetrators in Steven Spielbergs impressive though spotty Munich And thats a dramatic challenge for a long movie (2 3/4 hours) that also leans toward the emotionally distant. Mathieu Kassovitz left and Eric Bana are operating in the shadow in Steven Spielbergs Munich. Universal Studios Fictionalized and based on the 1984 book Vengeance it tells of a top-secret Israeli hit squad avenging the Palestinian killings of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympic Games. As hot-button as this is the movie has sparked a curious aesthetic controversy several positive reviews but a couple of notable drubs then the cover of Time followed by a Golden Globes best-drama snub. About the movie Munich    1/2 out of four Stars Eric Bana Geoffrey Rush Daniel Craig Ciaran Hinds Director Steven Spielberg Distributor Universal Rating R for strong graphic violence some sexual content nudity and language Running time 2 hours 44 minutes Opens nationwide Friday Well maybe it figures; Munich isnt quite like other Spielbergs. With its European tone and methodical assassinations it reminds me of 1973s The Day of the Jackal. And never more so than when Jackals Michael Lonsdale shows up in a couple of superb scenes as the French father of a sleazily neutral informant with whom the Mossad-vet protagonist (Eric Bana) must deal. Bana becomes increasingly weary from the time Golda Meir herself (an on-the-button Lyn Cohen) approves the hit force. Reporting to an all-business superior (Geoffrey Rush) Bana and four cohorts are never even fully sure whether theyre targeting the right people. The movie is fairly even-handed toward Palestinians but too brutal throughout to be called namby-pamby. Indeed Munich is best at its most violent a planted bomb that endangers a young girl; a whopper of a hotel explosion; a sexy barroom seduction that leads to the nastiest scene (albeit a great one) Spielberg has ever directed. Yet the movie has surprising lulls (some alas toward the end) and knockout set pieces are always coming to its rescue. The color quality oddly and notably varies and theres one major boo-boo. Someday Spielberg is likely to regret juxtaposing a flashback to the Olympics against an intense sex scene if he hasnt already. This is a smart and often tense work whose ultimate merit isnt completely calculable now. Of Spielbergs so-called serious movies its no Schindlers List or Saving Private Ryan but is closer to them than to Amistad. Its definitely powerful enough to make you wish hed head in this direction more often.

"Spielbergs Munich The Circle of Death washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Spielbergs Munich The Circle of Death ""Munich"" is not just a study of the Israeli response to the 1972 Olympic massacre; its an examination of the psychological effects of killing. (By Karen Ballard -- Universal Pictures Via Associated Press) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 23 2005 Steven Spielbergs ""Munich"" is not so much about war as about wars smallest most inevitable and ugliest component killing. Its about the psychological and political meaning of pointing the gun pulling the trigger and watching -- through the recoil and the muzzle flash -- as a penetrated human begins to squirt blood stagger stumble and fall toward eternal stillness. What then? A feeling of triumph? Exaltation at the slaying of the enemy? We win we win we win Chalk up another one boys. A good meal? A hoedown? According to Spielberg the consequence is quite the opposite despair self-doubt self-loathing loss of purpose paranoia hysteria nightmare -- in short what is called post-combat stress syndrome. Moreover one suspects he means to generalize from this specific example suggesting that what is true for the haunted individual is also true for the nation and the culture. They become kill-haunted too. The film arrives at politically todays classic liberal cri de coeur against the war in Iraq Its taking too long. Theres no plan. Its too violent. Its degrading us. We cant be like them. Too many people are dying. Itll never end. How did we get into this mess? Make it go away. Spielberg focuses on a small Israeli killing team five men more or less ordinary tasked with hunting and destroying the Palestinian Black September planners of the Munich massacre of 1972 -- in which 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team were held hostage and then killed -- across Europe and the Middle East in the fall and winter of that year. They still kill the old-fashioned way by bomb and gun and almost always theyre close enough to see the blood in lakes on the dirty floors or the limbs hanging as if meat-hooked to the ceiling after the detonation. Its not pretty its not Hollywood it has the scabrous dirty feel of reality. Nobody gives any speeches; the dead look like wet sacks of grapes that fell off trucks at high speed. And the killers being human themselves and not bull-goose loonies get sick and tired of it. Spielberg is working in some fashion from a book by George Jonas called ""Vengeance The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team"" though many doubts have been raised about its authenticity and I note that its not being re-released in conjunction with the movie. Other books such as the just-published ""Striking Back The 1972 Munich Olympics Massacre and Israels Deadly Response"" by Aaron J. Klein tell other stories of these events. (Jonas ascribes the Israeli action to one team; Klein suggests a much wider operation with teams combining and recombining as circumstances warranted over the months.) But both books agree Israeli assassins went hunting and hunted hard. The movie with a screenplay by Tony Kushner (""Angels in America"") chronicles a few months in the life and near-death of Avner Kauffman (Eric Bana) a former Golda Meir bodyguard then Mossad agent who is chosen to lead the unnamed unit (again nothing cool and code-wordy like ""Team Red"" or ""Alpha-Niner"" or ""Tiger""). Avner is naturally an idealist. His guys are far from the commando types usual to movies about Special Operations (and to actual Special Operations themselves) One is a frail toymaker whose circuitry skills lend themselves to bombs as well; another is a Brit thug who happens to be Jewish (Daniel Craig who will shortly play James Bond but here is content to be an ensemble professional); theres a reluctant ex-soldier and mild-mannered guy who could be an accountant (he wears bow ties and sweater vests). No tattoos no Seal or Delta machismo no eight hours a day spent on firing ranges or in shoot houses or hoisting iron in a gym no funny haircuts no sexy specialist weapons no throat or ear mikes -- just skilled technicians with clean backgrounds as unearthed by Israeli intelligence (represented by Geoffrey Rush as Avners case officer). Each has a fraudulent identity and access to a secret bank account but other than that they are on their own not only in killing but in administering travel and logistics and in uncovering intelligence. Thus the most provocative relationship in the film is not between Avner and his men or Avner and his case officer but Avner and a kind of curious -- and frankly hard to believe -- French freelance agent who represents an equally curious private intelligence network which for a high price can find anyone. Thats pretty much the movie The team seeks finds plans kills flees; and then it begins again. The names are supplied by Israeli intelligence; the team members take it on faith that they are serving justice not vengeance but the doubt begins to wear on them. Are these targets really directly involved in Munich or are they subsidiary people killable more because of their accessibility (all are ""soft targets"") than their actual guilt? That gets a guy down worrying about stuff like that. Spielberg has attracted even before the fact a great deal of criticism for the crime of moral equivalency; that is he shows how at the ground level the ideologies tend to vaporize and you are left with the squalor of violence. You can hate a man yes for what he has done and what he represents but at a certain point its difficult to bear that in mind. If you shoot him in the head he reacts exactly as a man who is innocent would react Theres really only one way to react to a bullet in the head. The movie is about the cost of such repetition and how it kills the soul. In the end Avner becomes a self-imposed bitter exile. At one point when two young Israeli soldiers express admiration for what hes done he recoils in horror. Its worth repeating however that this is a theme Spielberg didnt sound in ""Saving Private Ryan."" In that film he argued quite the opposite Kill them until theyre all gone. But killing like it or not is an important issue. Right now in the sandbox young Americans are killing in extraordinary numbers. Read David Zucchinos ""Thunder Run The Armored Strike to Capture Baghdad"" and realize that in the rush to the Iraqi capital American gunners spray-painted literally hundreds of men bright red. The killings of armed combatants were all legal and sanctioned at the highest levels of government. And nobody cares. Nobody wonders What of those machine-gunners? Do they just go back to civilian life with 150 kills on their memory at the age of 21? Whats the long-term cost? Whats the cost in short not of dying but of killing? How many times can you pull the trigger before you begin to go sour? We owe it to our guys to contemplate the issue. So give the movie credit for its rigor in facing this depressing problem and not covering it in Shinola and the other stuff as do most movies on war or armed conflict. Thats very impressive but at the same time ""Munich"" has a few seedy aspects. For one thing its strangely obsessed with . . . food? Yeah food. Avner a cook is continually preparing giant meals for the team and as they discuss killing this Black Septemberist or that they peel potatoes dice celery beat eggs. Its very odd. Then worse in a somewhat crude attempt to impose a suspenseful structure the narrative memories of the Munich massacre are inserted throughout climaxing in intimate scenes where the Black September terrorists blow up one helicopter and machine-gun the hostages at point-blank range. Problem Whose memories are these? The cinema grammar of the film places them in Avners head though he wasnt there so who exactly is doing the remembering? But Spielberg has done this before (the ""false memory"" is the central structural device in ""Saving Private Ryan""). The bigger problem is the question of appropriateness. It seems almost disrespectful to weave in a provocative re-creation of the killings -- somehow a massacre of unarmed innocents that shocked the world should be more than just fodder for ginning up the tension at the end of a commercial movie. Then theres a strange even troubling episode where the boys hunt down and execute a contract killer -- who has taken out one of their own -- apparently under the pay of the Russians who are ticked off that the team accidentally whacked a KGB agent when they were blowing up a target in a Cyprus hotel room. The contract killer is in fact a beautiful woman and she is in fact naked when her executioners arrive with silenced .22s disguised as bicycle pumps. The scene plays out with weird sadomasochistic sexual overtones that will remind aging boy baby boomers of their most salacious prepubescent memories (guilty) of the commingling of sex and violence in the famous near-pornographic ending of Mickey Spillanes ""I the Jury."" Spielberg may be arguing that in this case the hit was not ordered by Jerusalem but is purely at the initiative of the surviving members; the team had become They The Jury. Nevertheless the weird almost pornographic vibration of the sequence is itself completely uncharacteristic of Spielberg and completely gratuitous. The problem with ""Munich"" is simple It asks hard questions and finds easy answers. Munich (140 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for intense violence and sexual content.

Several months later when a family emergency forced us to fly back to England in a hurry the passport came back within 24 hours with my husbands photo expertly glued back in place and a host of exotic countries hed never set foot in stamped into the visa section. For the life of me I cant remember whether all this happened before or after that September when 11 Israeli athletes were killed by Black September terrorists at the Olympic Games in Munich. What I do remember is how thoroughly jazzed (albeit discreetly in deference to my surly-young-lefty opposition to the whole passport business) my partner was to be drafted however indirectly into the defense of a country whose siege mentality was still defined by the scars of the Holocaust even if the threats to its existence now came from its next-door neighbors. That same frisson at being let in on a grand secret conspiracy is what makes Steven Spielbergs Munich a riveting thriller -- and also what works against Spielbergs liberal-peacenik qualms about vengeance in general and government-sponsored counterterrorism in particular. Alongside Schindlers List and Saving Private Ryan Munich is being positioned in that sober part of the Spielberg oeuvre labeled responsible grown-up. Thats right as far as it goes but no one who has seen the film could possibly argue that the director has set aside his inner adolescent in making what is first and foremost a rip-roaring boys own adventure. With its frenetically fragmentary globe-trotting structure the film recalls not just the paranoid political thrillers of the 1970s its lovingly fashioned after but Stephen Gaghans recent Syriana which can be read as an update of Munichs account of the roots of modern global terror. True Gaghan is a committed leftist whos openly contemptuous of United States foreign policy while Spielberg is an American patriot and a Zionist with strong ties to Israel as well as a good liberals sympathy for the Palestinians. But both filmmakers are caught between political and moral scruple and a vibrant schoolboy addiction to the thrill of the chase and the technology of killing.I dont know anyone over 40 who doesnt remember the suspense of the Munich massacre breathlessly relayed by Jim Mckay in successive TV news updates that first had the hostages safe and unharmed then hours later told viewers that nine of the 11 had been killed most of them during a spectacularly bungled assault by the Germans who also later to the helpless rage of the Israelis gave the surviving Palestinians safe passage to the Middle East. The episode pushed many Israeli buttons not the least of which was a recognition of their own uncharacteristically lax security arrangements in the Olympic Village of a host country trying to live down its catastrophic intervention in Jewish history. This may be one reason why Munich focuses more on the Israeli reprisal than on the massacre itself which is paid out in edge-of-your-seat installments as a motivating memory in the troubled mind of Avner (played by Aussie hulk Eric Bana) head of a Mossad-sponsored team quickly pulled together to take out as many members and affiliates of Black September as could be found hiding in Europe. A young bodyguard with family ties to Mossad Avner is handpicked by Prime Minister Golda Meir (a grandmotherly Lynn Cohen in baggy dress and support hose -- imagine the extreme makeover shed get from the image consultants today) to go after the terrorists with an international team that includes Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz) a Belgian toy maker who builds quaint little bombs on the side; Hans (Hanns Zischler) a German who forges documents and does the accounts for each pricey assassination; Steve (Daniel Craig) a belligerent South African getaway driver of the blood-and-guts school of Jewish nationalism; and Carl (Ciaran Hinds) the quietly efficient cleanup man.Fueled by Spielbergs bottomless appetite for paranoid conspiracy Munich is an extraordinarily effective and occasionally uproarious account of the early phase of global terror with its mushrooming webs of secretive links between groups often dedicated to opposing goals. The implication that both Mossad and Black September were tied into the CIA is the least of it Most of Avners information about the whereabouts of his scattered targets comes from a murky French group headed by a simultaneously sinister and avuncular paterfamilias (played by the terrific Michael Lonsdale) who still smarting from French humiliation at the hands of the Nazis and its own Vichy collaborators will do business only with individuals not governments. (One senses that Spielberg who never saw a father figure he didnt like or a government he did is with him all the way.) Like Gaghan in Syriana Spielberg wants to invite us into the visceral terrifying pleasures of the hunt while dutifully questioning whether it should ever have been mounted in the first place. Washed in Janusz Kaminskis foggy desaturated light Munich would have us gorge on the romance of blood which seeps sensuously from shot-out brains smoking corpses severed hands. Spielberg wants us to share in his amused delight at the rinky-dink telephone bombs used by 1970s assassins -- quaint jokes compared to the long-range precision missiles used today if just as deadly. And of course he cant do without his avenging heroes. But he also wants us to feel his pain over the endless cycle of violence between Israelis and Palestinians and as this three-hour drama wears on with terrorists from both sides pleading their case (the screenplay which was written by Eric Roth and worked over by playwright Tony Kushner is Kushner at his most rhetorical and declamatory) theres a gathering stench of bad faith in the tug between gory excitation and moral squeamishness.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm Munich wavers between reliance on a widely disputed book by Canadian journalist George Jonas -- who claimed the Israeli response to the massacre was a largely emotional desire for vengeance and that they got the men they wanted -- and Time reporter Aaron J. Kleins contention in Striking Back a new book (hastily rushed out last week as what the publishers enchantingly call a ""reverse tie-in"" to the movie) that the assassinations were strategic but mostly bagged only minor figures whose affiliation to Black September was at best marginal at worst doubtful. (Should we be disgusted or amused that both Mossad and Mohammad Daoud who masterminded the Black September massacres were miffed at not being consulted for the movie?) In his only interview about Munich Spielberg told Time film critic Richard Schickel that his ideological inspiration is the Israeli novelist and peace activist Amoz Oz who believes that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will go unresolved as long as both sides are working from the mentality of the truly oppressed. Im with him there but Munich is at best a muddled prayer for peace whose weakness stems not from its politics but from the misconception of its main character. Avner is not just a fictional character but an absurdly improbable expression of Spielbergian schmaltz. No self-respecting secret service let alone the hard-bitten Mossad would send an operative as sensitive and morally fastidious as this young man into the field. And if by some error of judgment it did hed be yanked home to a desk job pronto if he conducted himself like Avner who goes into full murderous rampage against the targeted Palestinians pausing every half-hour or so to rustle up comforting briskets for his passionately Zionist teammates and engage in earnest debate about whether theyre doing the right thing. In the more savvy Israeli thriller Walk on Water released earlier this year Lior Ashkenazis assassin is far more persuasively so overwhelmed by battle fatigue that he ceases to feel anything at all and with mechanical ferocity goes on doing his job over the objections of his alarmed handlers.For his part Avner grows ever greener about the gills coos to his new baby over the phone while bursting into tears and in a truly ridiculous sequence near the end that signals little more than Spielbergs embarrassed discomfort with onscreen sex tries to blot out the pain and fear with an energetic fuck. If there is a compelling argument about the legacy of terror it slides in unobtrusively in the movies final scene in which Avner suspicious that he is now more the hunted than the hunter argues the efficacy and morality of his completed mission with his Mossad handler (Geoffrey Rush). Behind them presiding serenely over the lower Manhattan skyline stands that other hapless target of a September attack.

"Steven Spielbergs Munich. Slate Sign In Sign Up Steven Spielbergs Munich. Steven Spielbergs Munich. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 22 2005 1151 AM Death of a Hit Man Steven Spielbergs Munich and the hell of getting even. By David Edelstein A scene from Munich Rapidly overtaking the ""Cinema of Revenge"" is the ""Cinema of Revenge with a Guilty Conscience""--i.e. ""My people got even and all I got was this dumb hair shirt."" Whats the reason for this post-9/11 self-critical twist on the thriller genres beloved scenarios of injury and retaliation? Maybe its that the recent consequences of such thinking have been so catastrophic that despite invading two countries (Afghanistan and Iraq) quickly overthrowing their governments and inflicting massive casualties on their populations the enemys resistance has if anything grown more tenacious; and that our ally Israel among the worlds most reflexively vindictive nations hasnt managed with its instantaneous reprisals to stanch the flow of blood. At this juncture to make the movies we always have the ones that revel in righteous brutality would not only be socially irresponsible. It would be delusional. Advertisement And so comes Steven Spielbergs Munich (Universal) from a script by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth. Grim and tightly wound the movies tension unrelieved by warmth or humor it turns on the murder of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympic games and on the Israeli governments alleged response which was off the books hush-hush to bankroll a squad of covert operatives to assassinate the Palestinians believed to be behind the killings. Its hard to imagine a better motive for vengeance than the killing of national heroes (and civilians) on a world stage. And like any good thriller the first part of Munich catches you up in the Mission Impossible nuts-and-bolts ""procedural"" aspect of bringing the bad guys down surveillance followed by shootings and colossal bomb blasts. Take that terrorist vermin Afterward the team celebrates with buoyant back-patting over brewskis; you can almost hear them say ""And now its Miller time."" Even in the midst of the assassins exultation there are dissonances. The protagonist Avner (played by Eric Bana tall and mild-mannered with no trace of the Hulk) doesnt know what role the people he kills actually played in the Munich massacre. He didnt want this assignment which will take him away from his family for years. He has a new baby and a demanding spouse. (The script gives her a line thats a little too self-conscious ""Im not the heros nice wife."") But he obeys the call because hes a child of Israel--almost literally. Avners estranged father (omnipresent in his influence but never shown) was a hero in the war for Israeli independence. And when Avner was at an impressionable age his mother packed him off to be raised at a kibbutz--one of those secular socialized collectives that for so long was a point of nationalist pride. Avner is prevailed upon by no less than the Great Mother herself--Golda Meir. Having outraged many Israelis by negotiating with the Munich terrorists she has now embraced a different philosophy. ""These people want to destroy us"" she declares. ""To get peace we must show them were strong."" And it falls to Avner to write that message in blood. Advertisement Spielbergs movies often turn subtly on the absence of stable fathers and the resulting emotional vacuum. In Munich that vacuum is also a moral one. Avners surrogate father a Mossad higher-up called Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush) is cold and withholding--of both information and spiritual affirmation. Far more affectionate is Munichs third father figure known only as ""Papa"" (Michael Lonsdale) the patriarch of a French family that deals in supersecret intelligence providing Avner (for vast sums of money) with intelligence on the comings and goings of his targets. Papa is seen only in the context of his family--hordes of golden-haired grandchildren frolicking in bright sunlight on a country estate. He says wistfully that Avner could be his son. But he adds ever amoral and pragmatic that Avner is not his son and is therefore completely expendable. The coldness of this universe is reinforced by Spielbergs uninflected storytelling. His tone is flat and his visual texture rough; the film is full of unobtrusive hand-held camerawork and quick zooms. The exceptions are the flashbacks to the Munich murders the events revealed gradually in fragments through Avners daydreams and nightmares. Those flashbacks accelerate--hurtling toward the actual Munich bloodbath--as ambivalence and then revulsion seep into the present action. The men Avner kills dont seem like monsters. Theyre presented as cranky poets and loving fathers and fierce idealists and they regard their cause as righteous. (It is a powerful irony that the Palestinian who is said to be the Munich mastermind who looks and acts like your garden-variety terrorist scumbag is forever evading assassination.) Is Munich an apology for Palestinian terrorists--for men and women who barbarously murder civilians? I dont consider a movie that assigns motives more complicated than pure evil to constitute an apology. The Israeli government and many conservative and pro-Israeli commentators have lambasted the film for naivete for implying that governments should never retaliate. But an expression of uncertainty and disgust is not the same as one of outright denunciation. What Munich does say--and what I find irrefutable--is that this shortsighted tit-for-tat can produce a kind of insanity both individual and collective. As members of Avners own team (played by a blond Daniel Craig Ciaran Hinds Mathieu Kassovitz and Hanns Zischler) are picked off in chilling ways his escalating paranoia--and his hunger for absolutes for a ""world of our fathers"" that is long gone--transcends his time and place. There are sequences in Munich that make you sick with fear that are impossible to shake off--among them one in which a Palestinian professors little daughter is on the verge of answering a booby-trapped telephone. Most horrible of all is the movies one pure vengeance killing which is among the most appalling things Ive ever seen. We want that revenge--we want it fiercely. But its staged with such ugliness--as a sexual violation--that we choke on it. Munich reinforces the idea that--great Miltonian allegories notwithstanding--the notion of evil has become profoundly maladaptive. Today saying our enemy is ""evil"" is like saying a preventable tragedy is ""Gods will"" Its a way of letting ourselves off the hook for crimes committed in our name. Not incidentally its also a way for our enemies to let themselves off the hook. Munich has been regarded in some quarters as an affront How does Spielberg have the audacity to make a commercial thriller that questions the very concept of retaliation? And while were on the subject how does he have the audacity to make a sci-fi picture like War of the Worlds which uses a Martian invasion to evoke the trauma of 9/11? Well its too bad we dont have more mainstream narrative filmmakers with that kind of audacity. Munich is the most potent the most vital the best movie of the year.

Its one of his ""serious"" films stretching back to ""Amistad"" and ""Schindlers List."" Unlike most directors who attempt politically charged themes however Spielberg is first and foremost an entertainer with a full arsenal of cinematic skills.This facility of his cuts both ways. On the one hand it means that great and necessary subjects - the Holocaust the slave trade - are brought to life in ways that are far more vivid than the usual waxworks approach. But it also means that Spielberg sometimes lets his moviemakers instincts override the richest resonances in the material. Technique trumps depth.There is another problem with Spielbergs serious side and it is especially pertinent to ""Munich"" He has a reformers instincts which are admirable in a politician but can be detrimental to an artist who almost by definition sees life in more complex colors. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? As a piece of filmmaking ""Munich"" is rarely less than gripping. As a political essay as a brief against despair it is far less convincing. Spielberg along with his screenwriters Tony Kushner and Eric Roth wants to show us the way out of the cycle of violence in the Middle East and in essence his answer is ""Give peace a chance."" Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 The movie begins with the storming of the Olympic Village dormitory housing the Israelis by the extremist Palestinian group Black September. Two athletes are killed and nine are taken hostage in an effort to secure the release of 200 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Twenty hours later after a botched rescue attempt by German police the nine hostages as well as five terrorists and a German policeman are killed.Because the events unfolded live on global TV the Munich tragedy is often referred to as the beginning of modern-day terror tactics where media coverage is all-important. The official Israeli response was the Air Force bombing of PLO bases in Syria and Lebanon. Unofficially Prime Minister Golda Meir dispatched a five-man commando unit dubbed ""the Wrath of God"" to assassinate the surviving 11 Palestinian ringleaders of the massacre (as outlined in George Jonass book ""Vengeance"" upon which ""Munich"" is based). It is their story that Spielberg chooses to tell.The commandos are led by Avner (Eric Bana) a former Mossad agent and bodyguard to Meir who leaves his pregnant wife to team with a diverse quartet that includes Steve (Daniel Craig) the most rabidly gung-ho of the bunch - ""the only blood that matters to me is Jewish blood"" - and Robert (Matthieu Kassovitz) a Belgian bomb expert whose growing qualms about the human cost of the operation are a harbinger of things to come. Their operations carry them across Paris Beirut Tel Aviv Athens Geneva and Frankfurt to hunt their targets down.From a purely dramatic standpoint this grisly process of systematic elimination has an ""And Then There Were None"" quality but Spielberg for the most part relieves the roteness by focusing on Avners expanding crisis of conscience. The only native Israeli in the unit he is clearly intended to represent the conflicted Israeli soul.And no doubt the filmmakers conflicted souls as well - Kushner the playwright of ""Angels in America"" and ""Homebody/Kabul"" has edited the book ""Wrestling with Zion Progressive Jewish-American Responses to the Palestinian/Israeli Conflict""; and Spielberg in his one official statement about the film said ""By experiencing how the implacable resolve of these men to succeed in their mission slowly gave way to troubling doubts about what they were doing I think we can learn something important about the tragic standoff we find ourselves in today.""But can we really? As The New York Times columnist David Brooks pointed out ""By choosing a story set in 1972 Spielberg allows himself to ignore the core poison that permeates the Middle East Islamic radicalism. In Spielbergs Middle East there is no Hamas or Islamic Jihad. There are no passionate anti- Semites no Holocaust deniers like the current president of Iran no zealots who want to exterminate Israel.""Avners eventual loss of faith in Zionism could more plausibly be reckoned a psychological crisis. Cut off not only from his wife and newborn baby daughter but also from everyone except his fellow operatives Avner is a cipher in torment. When his mother tells him that she is proud of what he is doing when she says of Israel that ""we have a place on earth at last"" her words fall on deaf ears. (Spielberg is careful to include a Palestinian Avners counterpart who also speaks passionately of a homeland.)Relocated to Brooklyn with his wife and child Avner cant even make love to his wife without flashing back in his mind to the commando horrors he has experienced. But of course soldiers can be traumatized even when convinced of the justness of their cause. Spielberg equates - and I would say confuses - Avners mental collapse with the collapse of his political ideals.It doesnt help that Avner is a sketchily drawn character throughout; his dissolution lacks the metaphorical fullness that was obviously intended. When he says ""I have no idea where I should be"" we stand apart from his sorrow because we have never really been placed inside his skin. For a film that professes to be about the human cost of politics our lack of identification with him represents a crucial and finally insurmountable flaw.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

"Munich | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; munich ) Munich (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli A film of uncommon depth intelligence and sensitivity Munich defies easy labeling. Watching the movie is like reading a top-notch espionage thriller by Le Carre or Deighton. Yet at the same time this is a visual experience. The moral and ethical elements layered atop a story that is ripe with suspense put to shame Hollywoods typical ventures into this genre. Munich is an eye-opener - a motion picture that asks difficult questions presents well-developed characters and keeps us white-knuckled throughout. It is the best film of 2005. I was five years old at the time of the 1972 Olympics so my recall of events is shaky. But I remember my parents being engrossed by the television coverage and I understood at the time that something terrible was happening. Some of that coverage - news clips featuring Jim McKay Peter Jennings and others - is used during a fifteen-minute prologue in Munich. This film is not about the Black September terrorist action that shattered the stillness of the Munich Olympic village but about Israels response to that act. Spielberg sets the stage by opening with a mixture of dramatic re-creations and archival news footage. By the time we meet the main character Avner (Eric Bana) the die has been cast. Avner is the leader of a five-man team of covert ex-Mossad operatives who have been given unofficial status by the government of Israel so they can track down and assassinate the 11 Palestinians responsible for planning and executing the attack. Their lone contact is their handler Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush) who provides them with information about how they can obtain money to fund their operation. Avner accepts the job despite having a seven-month pregnant wife (Ayelet Zurer) waiting for him in Jerusalem. For Avner nothing is more important than patriotism - at least when the ordeal begins. The group consists of Steve (Daniel Craig) a South African hothead who is eager - almost too eager - to shed blood; Carl (Ciaran Hinds) an unnaturally cool and collected ""cleaner""; Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz) a toymaker-turned-bombmaker; and Hans (Hanns Zischler) an expert forger. After making contact with an information collector named Louis (Mathiew Amalrac) Avner begins learning the locations of his targets. His mission takes him around the globe - from Paris to DA1/4sseldorf to Beirut to Athens to London to New York City - as his pursuit of his goal becomes single-minded. Tragic near-misses an erosion of conscience and the realization that the hunters may have become the hunted turn Avners assignment into a nightmare. And the most dangerous target - who may be allied with the CIA - remains elusive. Munich which is based on George Jonas book Vengeance claims to have been ""inspired"" by true events which places it into the category of fiction. Key events occurred but all of the character interaction is made up. Despite the historical nature of the story the synergy with todays events is impossible to miss. Every word that is spoken about terrorism is as relevant today as it was in the early 1970s. The best espionage thrillers are gritty claustrophobic pieces filled to the brim with lies betrayals and paranoia. Those qualities are evident here. What begins as an act of patriotic fervor ends in a quagmire of moral ambiguity. Avner doesnt know what to believe any more and he has lost the capacity to differentiate right from wrong necessary from gratuitous. Whats one more death even if the persons name isnt on the list? The currency of his world is information but its reliability is often determined after its too late. And trust is a luxury Avner cannot afford. The deeper one gets into the espionage game the more difficult it becomes to differentiate reality from a fabric of deceit woven by enemies - if those enemies truly exist. Munich illustrates how Avners moral compass is knocked askew. In the beginning he doesnt question the righteousness of his actions. But when it comes to make the first kill he hesitates and it falls to one of his confederates to fire the shot. As killing becomes easier Avner questions its morality before ceasing to care. It becomes a routine learn where the next target is devise a plan then execute it. On one occasion - perhaps the most tense and masterful scene in the film - a little girl answers an explosives-packed phone that is intended as a lethal trap for her father. On another occasion Avner ends up within the blast radius of one of his bombs. With each assassination there is a Black September reprisal a bomb in a bus station a shooting spree etc. Theres nothing new about the cycle of terrorism but all it means to Avner and his team is that they have opened a ""dialogue"" with their opponents. For Prime Minister Golda Meir the doctrine is inescapable ""Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own valuesa| Forget peace now. We have to show them were strong."" Does Israel have the moral high ground? And if so for how long? At one point one of Avners team comments ""[We] do what the terrorists do."" In the trenches of this kind of war are there good guys and bad guys or has everyone slipped into the murky gray of the middle ground? Spielberg asks but cannot answer a key question Is a war against terrorism winnable? We would like to think the answer is ""yes."" It would help us sleep better at night. But Munich points out a sobering truth for every terrorist killed there is another - possibly a worse one - waiting to take his place. Capturing or killing Osama bin Laden would be a great propaganda victory but would it mean anything? In the end Avner and his team must face this question. Can the killing end with 11 men when each is replaced before his body has been interred? Spielberg takes pains to present both sides of the issue. To proffer the Palestinian perspective he provides a rational terrorist who engages in an intellectual debate with Avner about how the Palestinians have resorted to the only methods left to them how they are willing to wait generations to achieve their aims and how the concept of ""home"" - no matter how unappealing the actual land - is precious beyond all others. Black September unlike other recognizable terrorist groups like the IRA is the only organization without a land to call its own. With a performance that never misses a beat Eric Bana gives us a man who loses his way morally and spiritually. When he acts purely for revenge Avner becomes what the Mossad intended but he never envisioned. As Steve future James Bond Daniel Craig shows a caged homicidal fury. Ciaran Hinds (seen most recently as Julius Caesar in HBOs Rome) depicts Carl as a dignified repressed man whose passion is bubbling beneath the surface. Mathieu Kassovitz and Hanns Zischler round out the primary team of actors with sincere low-key performances. The chameleon-like Geoffrey Rush shows up as Avners handler. Veteran French actors Michael Lonsdale and Mathiew Amalric play the father-and-son source of much of Avners information. With Munich Spielberg has emphasized his position as one of the worlds most compelling filmmakers. (Some might I suppose consider Munich to be a penance for War of the Worlds.) The film works on numerous levels and like Saving Private Ryan it becomes the rare genre film that escapes its expected boundaries and is transformed into something new and powerful. This is a serious adult motion picture. The ending is not as bleak as it could be but it will send audiences away in a reflective mood pondering not only the events of the film but how close Spielbergs fictionalized world of the early 70s is to our real world in the 2000s.

Long-term commercial forecast looks iffy unless heavy awards-season attention provides a boost. As Steven Spielberg ponders the pointlessness of tit-for-tat retaliation between Israelis and Palestinians audiences will weigh ""Munich"" and find it wanting -- wanting involving characters and economical storytelling for starters. The directors long-gestating meditative thriller on the aftermath of the massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympic Games takes its own sweet time making obvious points about the Jewish nation compromising its own values and in the process forgets to be a pulse-quickening suspenser. Beautifully made pic will spur newsy media coverage and possible consternation on both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian divide but members of the general public will be glancing at their watches rather than having epiphanies about world peace. Younger audiences will be difficult to attract and long-term commercial forecast looks iffy unless heavy awards-season attention provides a boost. Its rare for such a popular entertainer as Spielberg to fail to provide a rooting interest or in its absence a point of entry to one of his films. But the very premise of the film that violence simply spawns more violence runs contrary to viewer involvement especially when the central character the only one about whom any personal details are provided is simply not very compelling. From a filmmaking point of view Spielberg is working in the political thriller vein epitomized by Costa-Gavras ""Z"" and close to the domestic suspenser-with-substance mode of ""The French Connection."" Directors fleet visual style creates some potent visceral set pieces and wonderfully evokes the early 70s Mediterranean and Euro settings. But the laborious ""Ten Little Indians""-style plotting overwhelms the technique so what could have been a heart-pounding two-hour drama with serious overtones instead emerges as a lumpy and overlong morality play on a failed thriller template. George Jonas controversial tome ""Vengeance"" was adapted once before in 1986 for the well-received HBO telefilm ""Sword of Gideon"" directed by Michael Anderson and written by Chris Bryant about a five-man commando unit unofficially sent out by the Israeli government to assassinate the 11 Palestinian terrorists identified as ringleaders in the murders of 11 Israeli Olympic team members. For Americans of a certain age the 1972 Olympics will always be remembered through the reporting of ABC anchor Jim McKay with the assists from Peter Jennings and Howard Cosell and it is with their able efforts that Spielberg begins this ""inspired by real events"" account of the Black September gunmens break-in to the Israeli dormitories where they killed some men and took others hostage. Snippets of how the final tragedy came to pass at an airport are dispersed throughout the remainder of the picture most grotesquely when its explosive climax is intercut with a sexual act. Saying ""Forget peace for now we have to show them were strong"" Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen) approves a secret plan to track down the perpetrators. Heading the team of assassins is Avner (Eric Bana) a former Massad agent and bodyguard to Meir whos briefed on his assignment by an intimidating case officer (a forceful Geoffrey Rush); hell have four colleagues plenty of money and will operate entirely off the books. Leaving behind his pregnant wife Avner heads for Europe where he convenes with fearless Steve (Daniel Craig) buttoned-down Carl (Ciaran Hinds) alleged bomb expert Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz) and document forger Hans (Hanns Zischler). They plot their first hit against a seemingly affable middle-aged literary translator in Rome. Working in a nimble visually warm vein with regular lenser Janusz Kaminski Spielberg brings a fresh almost New Wave feel to his many street and cafe scenes in such diverse cities as Geneva Paris Beirut Tel Aviv Athens and London all summoned up with rich efficiency on locations in Malta Hungary and France. Spielberg even employs the zoom lens in a recognizably 70s manner and the vaguely funky feel of standard-issue Euro hotel rooms is palpable. The second hit against a comfortably ensconced Parisian Palestinian does not go so smoothly and gives the director a chance to create a queasy Hitchcockian sequence involving an innocent little girl answering a bomb-implanted phone. Even by this relatively early stage deeply ambivalent feelings are generated about the unfolding drama feelings that soon come to be shared by Avner. Oddly however Avner is not an especially empathy-inducing character. This is partly due to the script and partly because Bana doesnt suggest much about Avners inner life. To really succeed ""Munich"" would need to have gotten in deep with Avner so that the viewer would be implicated in his growing conflict. The film provides a resolutely exterior experience. Unintentionally illuminating the general deficiencies are superb scenes involving Avners shadowy French contacts. Initially Avner deals with the edgy Louis (Mathieu Amalric). Later he meets Louis father (Michael Lonsdale) a shaggy old St. Bernard of a man who dispenses enigmatic aphorisms while preparing elaborate meals at his exquisite country estate. Not as on-the-nose as most of the rest of the flabby script by playwright Tony Kushner and Eric Roth these scenes are conspicuously well written and acted by Amalric and Lonsdale and exist on a level only approached again by a scene involving an exceedingly fetching girl (Marie-Josee Croze) in a hotel bar. Interludes echo the theme of French duplicity in such matters that were central to Hitchcocks ""Topaz"" and also remind that very little goes down in the Middle East without the French being involved behind the scenes a point ""Syriana"" is remiss to ignore. Hanging over ""Munich"" is the enervating feeling that were going to have to wait through 11 assassinations for things to wrap up. As it happens it never gets to that point as missions are botched the most important Palestinian targets remain elusive the wrong people get killed and Avners conscience gets the better of him. The wrestling match between the impulse for moral justice and the rational desire to break the cycle of violence is the crux of the film but the issue is explored in a far too explicit and obvious manner. Pic simply does not sustain intellectual interest on a meaningful level. Spielberg Kushner and Roth go out of their way to try not to demonize Palestinians or anyone else but the story is indisputably told with Jewish and Israeli concerns at heart. Filmmakers fair-minded liberal instincts have moved them to create a work that espouses rejecting an-eye-for-an-eye in order to give peace a chance. Unfortunately in the Middle East the olive branch has so frequently been met with guns that its hard to feel that theres anything provocative or new or promising in the films message. All the same the range of Jewish and Arab opinion on the film should be interesting. Script provides none of the characters but Avner with any personal information so the men played by Craig Hinds Kassovitz and Zischler are no more known by the end than they are at the beginning. Technically the picture is superb with all hands delivering no-nonsense work at a high level. John Williams subdued flavorful score is perhaps as atypical as is his concurrent one for ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" the film Spielberg once intended to make himself.
