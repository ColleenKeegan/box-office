This time its suburban teenager Charlie Brewster (Anton Yelchin) whos sceptical when his nerdy high school pal Evil Ed (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) insists that Charlies handsome new neighbour Jerry Dandridge (Colin Farrell) is a vampire. And Peter Vincent the allegedly clued-up adult from whom Charlie and Ed seek advice about crosses garlic and holy water has metamorphosed from Roddy McDowalls ageing ex-horror movie actor-cum-TV host into a flamboyant leather-clad Las Vegas magician - bizarrely played by David Tennant as if hes channelling Russell Brands twin brother. Farrell is sexy as hell so its easy to see why Charlies mother (Toni Collette) and his hitherto chaste girlfriend (Imogen Poots) fall under his spell. But this is a boring revamp with dull 3D effects insipid teenage protagonists and only sporadically scary outbursts of neck-biting crucifix-wielding and staking through the heart.

There were some funny moments from the supporting cast (McLovin Dave Franco and D-Money from Modern Family) and the missus was all over Colin Farrell. Other than that the film is fairly forgettable. One thing that annoyed me was that the film is only available to watch in 3D forcing people (like me) who dont like 3D to stump up the extra cash for something they dont want. Also the film had the crappest use of 3D Ive ever seen. It wasnt even a post-conversion so there really is no excuse for the poor effects.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 5 2011dragsterFeaturedI never saw the 85 version so I cant make balanced view as to how crap or otherwise this offering is in comparison. What did surprise me was just how minimal the plot was the simplest shortened reworking of the early films with the only twist being that the ""Helsing"" character is not pushing things on from the start. Some moderately detailed transformation scenes including an unexpected one of a reasonable facsimile ""Captain Jack"" (Sparrow) type persona into something more recognisably Tennant-ish and I did wonder whether they might force him to say ""quick get a doctor"". Agreed that the 3d was wasted. In the lower third of the films Ive seen this year.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 5 2011scrumpyjackFeaturedWow Mandy Thats WAY too much time and dedication to give to a film like this or the original All that needs to be said is it isnt very good and (as it is filmed in 3D not post converted) it contains the dullest 3D in history. Look its been a good few years now. Dark 3D = NO Light 3D = YES so as 90% of this is set in the dark no 3D please. Clear? also if anyons worried by the Tennant factor he isnt actually bad here. Does anyone know when a scary horror is due by the way? 5/10FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 4 2011mandyFeaturedI dont think I can put into words just how much I hate this movie. Initially I was looking forward to it. When I first saw the posters of David Tennant in his costume about 6 months ago I thought it was a brilliant change. I thought perhaps he was a has-been Buffy style actor or has Been Hugh Jackman Van Helsing actor the way the original Peter Vincent was a has-been Hammer Horror actor. I loved the idea of David Tennant as Peter Vincent. When Marti Noxon said that horror movie hosts dont exist anymore and thats why she changed Peter Vincent to a stage magician I felt she missed the point. Movie hosts were NEVER fashionable. There are more now than there were in 1985 in fact the character was being fired when the original movie began. Then I read the remake script and I was disappointed. I ranted and raved but I hoped it was just a rough draft script. I hoped I was wrong about it. Then I saw a clip of David Tennant and I had hope again. But then I saw the ComicCon Q and A and the director revealed he couldnt recall the plot of the original and he felt this was a good thing. This filled me with dread. Then I saw the actual film and I was thoroughly disappointed. David Tennants attractive but thats not enough to save it from bad writing. Charley is selfish and self-absorbed. Its cynical and judgmental of teenagers of today its kind of insulting. Peter Vincent isnt very well developed and neither is Jerry Dandridge. Hes turned into a two dimensional psychopath with no real motivation other than to kill. Even Dracula had a plan In fact he had very elaborate plans in the novel. These vampires in this remake cant even shapeshift into a wolf bat or mist. They cant enthrall minds and they cant even show up on digital camera (which dont have mirrors by the way). How is stripping them of powers and giving them more limitations an improvement? And isnt it the slightest bit annoying that a character in the movie has to tell us how modern Jerry Dandridge is just because he has his minion say sir instead of master? The dialogue in the movie is awful too. The F word is used more than Charleys name. I dont care if a film is loaded with foul language but its so over used that its annoying. If the word banana was used so much Id be just as annoyed. 10 things that would improve this remake 1. Tom Holland as the writer or another writer familiar with Dracula style vampires. Even the writer of Dracula 2000 or Van Helsing would have been better than Marti Noxon. 2. Respect for the intelligence of the audience. i.e. keeping Peter Vincent as a has-been horror actor who perhaps now has a web series as to modernize his position. 3. Kept the shapeshifting abilities because its freaky and makes the vampires all the more powerful. 4. Leave the hint of humanity in that Jerry was looking for the look-a-like of a lost love. This gives a twinge of sympathy and also makes it all the more twisted and frightening when he does something evil because youre taken off guard. 5. Find a director who actually is fan of the original and remembers it fondly and knows Gothic atmosphere who can make suburbs creepy like Tim Burton or Del Toro. 6. Leave it set in the suburbs. Every country has suburbs. Most places dont have their own Vegas. 7. Make sure the hero is relatable and a decent human being. A self-absorbed tool who abandons friends for popularity just doesnt cut it. 8. A better budget. 15 million is pocket change today by Hollywood standards. 9. Knowledge of what is popular in the genre. The director and writer of this remake THINK things like Saw and Final destination are in and Gothic is old. Actually its the opposite. Let Me in did very well. The last Saw movie did lower than expected. The Wolfman remake got an oscar while Final destination 5 is struggling. Dark Shadows Harker Dracula 3D and Haunted Mansion are in production right now. Lady in Black with Hrarry Potters Daniel Radcliffe is getting released through Hammer Horror in a few months. There are two Frankenstein films in production and Priest did well. Slasher films are out. Gothic horror is back with a vengence and the ones who made this remake are really out of touch to not know that. 10. An effort to NOT appeal to any particular demographic. Notice how Tim Burtons films are always successful even when people complain about how formulaic theyve become. He never tires to appeal to a demographic. He makes films that appeal to his tastes and to Hell with what the studio thinks kids want today. Sleepy Hollow was going to be a generic low-budget slasher film with no romance or atmospehre but then Tim Burton got a hold of it and added the supernatural added the love story and added the Hammer Horror-esque atmosphere and he made it work where it would have failed. If Hollywood would just stop trying to condescend to what it thinks is a simple minded audience we might start getting quality horror films again. Some people are already trying and its working. This film is not.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 3 2011Ilya KFeaturedNigel I should expect that you will be receiving a visit from several very large blokes wearing Dreamworks and Disney jackets encouraging you to ""reevaluate"" your review...seeing as many of your compatriots around the world seemed to have already received such a visit and immediately complied. I guess all it takes nowadays to reach the 18-24 crowd is drop as many F bombs in the movie as possible and not give your lead actor much to do except make funny faces and twist his head around like hes having a seizure.

LLC.) B Fright Night Genre Horror Comedy; Starring Colin Farrell Anton Yelchin David Tennant; Director Craig Gillespie; Author Marti Noxon Tom Holland; Release Date Wide 08/19/2011; Runtime (in minutes) 120 Posted August 21 2011 -- 1200 AM EDT Fright Night is a 3-D remake of a vampire movie and so in theory should be a state-of-the-union address of everything that is currently wrong with Hollywood but instead it ends up getting a surprising number of things right. The film largely works not because the plot hews closely to that of the 1985 original -- excepting a few smart updates that help brush off the graveyard dirt -- but because it also resurrects its spirit offering up equal parts scares and fun without letting them fuse into camp. Anton Yelchin is Charley a high school student living with his single mother (an underused Toni Collette) in the copy-and-paste tract housing of a Las Vegas exurb. When his former best friend (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) alerts him to the fact that his new next-door neighbor -- the innocuously named Jerry -- may be a vampire his dullish life quickly turns into a battle for survival. Colin Farrell?s performance as Jerry is the pulsing stakeable heart of the movie. If the Twilight melodramas have tamed bloodsuckers by turning them into gelded (and gilded) objects of affection Farrell makes his vampire terrifying precisely by returning his sexual agency and ramping up his dangerousness. At one point he?s called ""the shark from Jaws"" an apt comparison He circles his victims with chilling deliberateness black eyes flashing hungrily. But Farrell also evinces another type of predation. As a hunky virile guy-next-door -- he drinks Bud as well as blood -- he tries to ingratiate himself with Charley?s mother and win an invitation into their home. A well-executed sequence in which Charley keeps Jerry at the threshold of their back door as they both begin to understand exactly how much the other knows expertly ratchets up suspense. The movie?s Van Helsing stand-in a role originated by Roddy McDowall as a cheesy Hammer-era horror host is played by David Tennant as a willowy Midori-swilling illusionist with eyeliner and cheeky swagger courtesy of Russell Brand. The script also cleverly updates the story by using the volatile housing market as the cause for Jerry?s appearance in the suburban sprawl Vampires don?t need to be invited into abandoned houses you see. A memorable use of a Century 21 sign hammers this point home or at least into a ribcage. Unfortunately the fun and frights are nearly undone by one of the most extraneous and ill-conceived uses of 3-D in recent memory. From the Corey Hart absurdity of having the audience wear tinted glasses for a movie set mainly at night to the countless CGI blood geysers needlessly thrown in to justify the extra dimension it?s both a distraction and a detraction. It doesn?t ruin the experience but it?s the only aspect of this vampire tale that really truly sucks.

There was little to demonstrate his directorial chops for updating a particularly playful horror-comedy from 1985. And yet this is what I get for assuming that filmmakers never want to try new things a remarkably confident remake that boasts its own pleasures more often than not. No small credit goes to Buffy vet Marti Noxon for her screenplay. This Fright Night does away with a general fondness for bygone monster movies in favor of making a sexual predator out of its vampire next door. Whereas Chris Sarandon was more of a classically romantic creature of the night in the first film Jerry (Colin Farrell) here is a greaser-handyman hybrid out to get his kicks. Charley (Anton Yelchin) discovers this sooner than before despite ignoring the accurate crackpot warnings of estranged nerd friend Ed (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and finds himself forced to protect his mother (Toni Collette) and girlfriend (Imogen Poots) against his voracious neighbor. Charleys actually a bit selfish this time around and Ed a bit sad (not to mention far less aggravating). The lone male in a fatherless home our hero initially acts out as a means of preserving his newfound social standing before realizing the very real threat that Jerry poses. Hes the jock that his girlfriend might go for the stepfather he doesnt want his mother to marry and while Yelchins performance is a generally likeable one its laced with insecurity throughout thus making Farrells prowling antics all the more potent. He lurks at doorways waiting to be invited in knowing full well that he can find another way to an artery if he isnt. Given his prolonged life span Jerry seems content with the fight that Charley puts up welcoming him to tussle with centuries of well-honed predatory instinct. Farrell has demonstrated no small amount of charisma before but never has he put it to such wily effect. Mintz-Plasses role on the other hand is defined by the resentment of Charley ignoring him after years of friendship. His arc is scantily established but serves as a curiously platonic counterpoint to the insatiable lust that both Jerry and reluctant vampire hunter Peter Vincent demonstrate. Vincents character used to be a hokey TV host for the late-night horror shows played wonderfully then by Roddy McDowall; now hes a Vegas showman with an interest in the occult and David Tennant (Doctor Who) renders him as Criss Angel by way of Russell Brand. His character isnt heroic this time around so much as hes handy and he serves as ready-made comic relief in a film that already manages to be pretty funny on its own. In fact the film takes a turn right around the time that Tennant shows up a turn also marked by an extended nigh dizzying sequence in and around a minivan that echoes similarly showy tricks used in War of the Worlds Children of Men and I Saw the Devil. The first half is laden with observations more clever than glib -- where better than Vegas for someone to be nocturnal and nondescript? -- and sequences more prone to being refreshingly patient such as one in which a snooping Charley tries to free a trapped girl from Jerrys home. The second half places an emphasis on action and CGI and feels more routine for it; even Ramin Djawadis amped-up score loses its personality by then. That said the film is still fun playing with popular vampire lore and often trying something new at a time when familiar titles and trace jobs tend to suffice. It may not all connect thematically or even logically (a house explodes in the suburbs to no apparent effect) but to its credit Fright Night generally remains funnier and creepier than many films of its ilk.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Aug. 19 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 240PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The new Dreamworks/Disney teen horror comedy Fright Night falls into the better-than-expected category. Like the original Fright Night (1985) the new version is mildly entertaining with some fun performances and some bonuses. Though they dont hit you in the face with it director Craig Gillespie ( Lars and the Real Girl) and writer Marti Noxon ( Buffy the Vampire Slayer) have slipped in some interesting economic subtext. Colin Farrell in a scene from Fright Night. YouTube.com Movies Fright Night The official trailer Young Charley Brewster (Anton Yelchin) and his real-estate-agent mother (Toni Collette) live in an isolated suburban housing tract outside Las Vegas (actually shot in Albuquerque) which is shown at night as a rectangle of light against the desert darkness. Charley who has recently made the transition from geek to semi-cool kid - this is a role Jesse Eisenberg or Michael Cera could have played a few years ago - is now dating the pretty and mature Amy (Imogen Poots) and trying to forget about his dweeby childhood buddy ""Evil"" Ed (Christopher Mintz-Plasse a.k.a. McLovin from Superbad). But Ed has something urgent to tell Charley. He has been documenting the number of schoolkids who have been disappearing and has narrowed down the suspect to Charleys new neighbour Jerry a night construction worker on the Vegas strip whom Ed believes is a vampire. ""Jerry?"" scoffs Charley. ""Thats a terrible vampire name."" And Vegas where the lights never turn off would seem to be a terrible vampire town though as Ed points out its got a transient population with a lot of night workers. Whats more its a great metaphor for the subprime mortgage crisis which hit that city particularly hard - whole neighbourhoods emptied as the economic life-blood ran out. The idea of high-risk homeowners (vampires) emptying schools and abandoning houses and real-estate brokers scrambling to make a living all makes sense. Fright Night has a few other grown-up themes. There are touches of David Lynch-style alienation in the bland half-pretty suburb where Farrells amusingly sleazy pale and muscular Jerry - dressed in black leering - is about as unobtrusive as a fly on a piece of Angel Food cake. Jerrys approach to getting to the neck tends to be crudely sexual with a lot of air-sniffing and talk about who is ""ripe."" Part of Charleys abhorrence for Jerry is that women including his single-but-looking mom (a nicely grounded Collette) and his girlfriend are attracted to Jerrys brand of rough trade. Even Ed falls for Jerrys charms in a scene loaded with homoeroticism. In contrast poor Charley seems almost as afraid of Amys forthright sexuality as he is of Jerrys bite. Though its full of repressed eroticism the movie has less nudity and fewer overt sexual situations than the original made more than 25 years ago. After all Fright Night is still a Disney movie so the metaphors of sex death and economic meltdown take second place to family-friendly comedy. With improbable naivete Charley concludes his vampire Google searches by deciding to seek the help of a local illusionist Peter Vincent (Scottish actor David Tennant of the BBCs Dr. Who). Tennant in a part that seems designed for Russell Brand is amusingly over-the-top at first though a little goes a long way and the bickering scenes between him and his partner (Sandra Vergara) are repetitive. Fright Night uses 3-D mostly for tracking through dark hallways and in the CGI-intense vampire-fighting climax. Mostly it feels inessential but theres the occasional pleasant surprise. In a scene with a fire near the end sparks appear to hover before your eyes for a moment before blinking out. A small glimpse of magic.

But the combo clicked in 1985s Fright Night (banish the 1988 sequel) and it clicks again in this frisky 3D remake. For that bow to Colin Farrell. Hes hot stuff as a vampire named Jerry (really) who moves next door to teenage Charley (Anton Yelchin) and his single mom (Toni Collette). Jerry can do his undead nasty on Charleys buddy (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and glamour Charleys girl (Imogen Poots) and still tickle you with terror. Damn that Farrell is good. So is David Tennant (Doctor Who) as Peter Vincent a tacky Vegas magician Charley enlists to kill Jerry. The young lovers are Twilight bland next to the power punch of Farrell and Tennant. Director Craig Gillespie (Lars and the Real Girl) is wise to just turn them loose. Voila Black magic.

Starring Anton Yelchin Colin Farrell Director Craig Gillespie Release Opened Aug 19 2011  Editorial Review Not so campy 2nd time aroundBy Sean OConnellFriday Aug 19 2011""Remake"" has become a curse word in Hollywood largely because of a flood of unnecessary updates meant to ""fix"" films that werent broken in the first place. As such audiences are being trained to react to remakes the way vampires react to crosses or garlic cloves Hiss scream then turn and run in horror. ""Fright Night"" is different. It stands apart from the rehash pack by accomplishing something rival remakes rarely do It improves on the premise it has been handed producing a modernized version of a decades-old story thats superior to its predecessor in virtually every aspect. In this case ""Fright Night"" director Craig Gillespie remakes Todd Hollands 1985 horror-comedy of the same name a dated slice of teenage paranoia that was neither scary nor funny the first time around (unless you count a few unintentional guffaws at the cheesiness of the films effects or the overall campy vibe). The story still steals from Alfred Hitchcocks masterpiece ""Rear Window"" with awkward teenager Charlie Brewster (Anton Yelchin) casting suspicions that his mysterious new neighbor Jerry (Colin Farrell) is a vampire. As Charlies accusations fall on deaf ears the arrogant Jerry engages in a deadly cat-and-mouse game that draws in Charlies childhood friend (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) his girlfriend (Imogene Poots) and a carnival-barking entertainer named Peter Vincent (David Tennant) who trades in the occult but lacks the faith needed to stand up to a vampire. Gillespies ""Fright Night"" doesnt drift too far from the originals structure though little tweaks made by screenwriter Marti Noxon - best known for her contributions to Joss Whedons genre-defining vampire soap opera ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" - lead to major improvements in Hollands initial plot. For starters the action moves from a nondescript suburb to a pop-up neighborhood outside of Las Vegas a self-described ""transient community"" where residents are casino employees who work all night and sleep all day. The simple location shift goes a long way toward explaining how Jerry is able to sink his teeth into a tight-knit community without alerting the authorities. The Vegas setting also allows Noxon and Gillespie to cleverly change their Peter Vincent character from the fey host of the late-night film series to a Las Vegas illusionist sleepwalking through his sold-out show at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino. Fans of the original ""Fright Night"" may miss Roddy McDowalls stagey Shakespearean turn as Charlies reluctant mentor but I quite enjoyed the sleazy approach Tennant takes in the role. A cross between Criss Angel and the boozy Russell Brand he puffs his chest with a phony bravado thats punctured by Jerrys undead presence. At its best ""Fright Night"" mixes sly pop- culture references ""Twilight"" jabs and Scooby gang jokes with legitimately suspenseful horror sequences sure to unnerve even the most-seasoned genre fans. Though Gillespie staked his claim with the offbeat indie comedy ""Lars and the Real Girl"" he deftly maneuvers this films lengthy action sequences the most memorable involving a minivan a motorbike a demonic hand and one of those real estate signs with sharp points on the end. All of this takes a back seat to Farrell who appears to be having a ball as Jerry the bored bloodsucker. Like a fat cat batting around an injured mouse Farrell plays off his innate sexuality and unforced charm to intimidate co-stars who appear less confident. Which in a word is everyone. Too bad Farrell cant do anything about the films ineffective 3-D. The glasses needed to see Gillespies ""Fright Night"" in another dimension do more harm than good and should be avoided at all costs. Outside of a few spurts of blood shooting off the screen the 3-D in ""Fright Night"" is forgettable and the tint from the glasses makes it seem like every scene in the film takes place at dusk. Youll enjoy ""Fright Night"" more if you see it in 2-D because the edgy thriller shows that when used right Hollywoods creatures of the night still have plenty of bite. Contains bloody horror violence and language including some sexual references.

A bland high school student (Anton Yelchin left) suspects his neighbor (Colin Farrell) of being a vampire in this bloodless ""Fright Night."" Jerry is a cute guy who lives next door. He likes Budweiser. Hes a vampire. Hes Jerry the Vampire. ""Fright Night"" is convinced youll find all this very daring hilarious and mold-breaking. Instead feeble comic one-liners and slow pacing combine for a routine fangfest in this remake of the 1985 film. Generic Las Vegas high school student Charley (Anton Yelchin) his even blander girlfriend Amy (Imogen Poots) and his nerd buddy Ed (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) investigate the doings of a weird neighbor (Colin Farrell) whose windows are blacked out all day. But this is Vegas -- people work on the Strip and sleep all day. The movie takes far too long to get going as Ed tries to convince Charley that his neighbor is the reason their friends are disappearing (a fact that seems to have been noticed by no one else). Ed then faces off against Jerry but the rules of vampire engagement arent clear. Crosses for instance seem to work . . . a little. Charley seems like a nice young man but all the time the movie spends on quiet scenes trying to establish him and Amy as characters is a slog. A bit better is the teasing between him and Ed but there isnt enough of it. There are several overlong scenes such as an odd but not very frightening encounter in which Jerry stands just outside Charleys doorway chatting about nothing much as the teen gets him some beer. The big moment? Charley gets nervous and drops a beer on the floor. So what? The director Craig Gillespie is a rookie in this genre (previously he did the quirky indie ""Lars and the Real Girl"" and the high school comedy ""Mr. Woodcock"") and has a hard time making the minutes count. For instance Charley breaks into Jerrys house and spends several minutes trying to sneak out unnoticed -- but Jerry eventually spots him and lets him go. So what was the point of the creeping around? Later nobody thinks to call the cops on Jerry even after hes committed a major crime that because it has nothing to do with being a vampire could easily be explained to the constabulary. In a chase scene Charleys mom (Toni Collette) drives nowhere useful but straight out into the desert where she wont be able to get a phone signal and where Jerry can do some nasty business without many eyeballs nearby. Speaking of Why dont the neighbors in his tightly populated subdivision ever seem to spot any of the curious things that go on at Jerrys house such as a person who colorfully explodes on the front doorstep in full daylight? The movies reason to exist is its self-consciously ""sassy"" dialogue which is neither witty nor fresh. People being terrorized spew attempted hipness ""This is seriously not OK"" and ""We could have rocked this evil s - - t together."" Jerry says things like ""Ever gotten a stake in the chest? I have. It hurts"" When victims escape he calls out ""Catch ya later"" All of this basically amounts to the same single joke and its as old as Draculas prom tuxedo. This movies writer Marti Noxon used to work up similar material for ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and the convention got pretty irritating even then. Even one character who promises to be amusing -- a spoof of Criss Angel (with a whiff of Russell Brand) who calls himself ""Peter Vincent Vampire Hunter"" (David Tennant) -- gradually diminishes until hes just a worried sidekick who gets to spend the climax cowering next to Charley. Sidekick to Batman or John Wayne is one thing. Sidekick to Anton Yelchin? It would be more dignified to have a strangers fangs in his jugular.

"Colin Farrell makes Fright Night fun - USATODAY.com Skip to Main Content USA TODAY Subscribe Mobile Home News Travel Money Sports Life Your Life Tech Weather Colin Farrell makes Fright Night fun By Scott Bowles USA TODAY Posted Comments Reprints amp; Permissions Jerry isnt your ideal next-door neighbor. Photos by DreamWorks Pictures Hello Jerry Colin Farrell is quite literally the neighbor from hell in Fright Night. EnlargeClose Photos by DreamWorks Pictures Hello Jerry Colin Farrell is quite literally the neighbor from hell in Fright Night. He keeps trash in his driveway blacks out his windows and flirts with every woman on the block. He feasts on teens too. Give him this He wont come in uninvited. Thats a vampire no-no of Fright Night a clever remake of the 1985 horror-comedy about a kid who cant convince anyone his neighbor is a vampire. MORE Colin Farrell doesnt sweat the small stuff Like the Roddy McDowall original Fright crackles by offsetting horror with humor. Like The Lost Boys and An American Werewolf in London there are chills (and gross-outs) to be sure. You wont want pasta after the movie. But director Craig Gillespie (who did the outstanding Lars and the Real Girl) has a formidable cast in Toni Collette Anton Yelchin and Colin Farrell who plays a surprisingly droll bloodsucker. Yelchin (Chekov in Star Trek) is Charley Brewster a teen maturing in a hurry -- to the notice of his high school classmates. Yelchin nails senior student posturing made all the more difficult by Charleys neighbor the smoldering Jerry (Farrell) a guy who has his eyes -- and fangs -- trained on Charleys mom Jane (Collette). Fright Night    out of four Stars Colin Farrell Toni Collette Anton Yelchin Director Craig Gillespie DistributorWalt Disney Pictures Rating R for bloody horror violence and language including some sexual references Running time 1 hour 41 minutes Opens Friday nationwide Fright has matured nicely over the quarter-century. While remaining sharp-tongued the film knows its place on the teen landscape. Vampires are hot property and references to Twilight abound. This though isnt Twilight mom stuff. Jerrys closet dungeon where he keeps victims to bleed is a starkly lit pen that could have come from Silence of the Lambs. And the 3-D -- which has proven itself most effective in horror -- makes the bone breaks and arterial geysers all the more graphic. Still Fright is clearly Hollywood summer fare. Slick and driven by a bass-heavy score the film embraces cliches by the cape-ful. Actresses are fashion-model pretty. Cops dont notice teens turning into veal. A stake to the heart still does the trick (though a real estate sign will do in a pinch). But Fright is way too quick on its feet to be slowed by cliches. David Tennant seizes McDowalls role as Peter Vincent now a Criss Angel-style clown vampire slayer. Christopher Mintz-Plasse was born to play a high school nerd. The real treat though is Farrell. How do you not like a vampire addicted to The Real Housewives of New Jersey? Between this and his cameo in Horrible Bosses hes summers hottest comic. Frights foul-mouthed beer-swilling bat boy may not be cut from the Twilight cloth but if he isnt careful he may find legions of fans on Team Jerry.

Starring Anton Yelchin Colin Farrell David Tennant and Toni Collette. Directed by Craig Gillespie. (R. 106 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) When youre a prince of the undead and your name is ""Jerry"" you have some compensating to do. Thankfully the Alpha bloodsucker in ""Fright Night"" is areal vampire. He doesnt go to high school get married or seek non-human alternatives to his blood habit. He has a pretty wicked sense of humor. And the body count reaches a satisfying four before the opening credits are done. ""Fright Night"" isnt quite a classic vampire movie but its refreshingly straightforward and self-deprecating. Colin Farrell is sexy and funny and a little bit menacing. In the scenes where a character has to choose between romance and bloody carnage the screenwriters always pick carnage. If Bela Lugosi came back to life today he wouldnt know what to make of the sparkling vampires in ""Twilight."" But he would almost certainly appreciate ""Fright Night."" Related Stories Farrell adds bite to Fright Night Review Fright Night For those too young to remember - and thats the bulk of the target audience - ""Fright Night"" is a remake of a 1985 film starring Roddy McDowall. The basics are the same. A geeky teen (Anton Yelchin) slowly discovers that a vampire (Farrell) has moved in next door and he recruits a professional vampire hunter with self-confidence issues to help his cause. A sign of the times television horror host Peter Vincent from the original film is gone replaced by a goth Las Vegas showman (David Tennant). The new Vincent lives in a casino surrounded by his museum filled with vampire-themed collectibles bought on eBay. ""Harry Potter"" and ""Doctor Who"" veteran Tennant brings a lot of humor to the cast which also includes Toni Collette in the Dee Wallace Stone single-mom-in-the-suburbs role. Pretty much no one in this movie uses their real accent but they all sound great. ""Fright Night"" suffers from a slow middle third with too many similar scenes featuring characters sneaking around in poorly lit hallways. The visuals overall were surprisingly dim at the critics screening I attended - probably the victim of a multiplex projector that presented a diluted 3-D image. But theres plenty of style and wit mixed in with the gloom. In a sign of the times real estate ""For Sale"" signs are put to good anti-vampire use. And ""Fright Night"" ends with a rock version of the Jay-Z track ""99 Problems"" playing during the credits. This movie aint one of them. E-mail Peter Hartlaub at phartlaubsfchronicle.com.

Slideshow When a vampire moves in next door Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about Fright Night >> But to accomplish this teenage metamorphosis Yelchins Charley Brewster has had to leave his past - and his nerdy former best friend - behind. Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Superbads McLovin) has the honors and has the old videos of the two fanboys parading around in dweeby superhero-costumed bliss. So Charleys a little cold toward his ex-pal. But then again he has Amy (the sunny English actress Imogen Poots) to warm him up. All of which unfortunately is beside the point because there arent any moral repercussions for Charleys snobbery and rejection. Well there is a repercussion but its not a moral one so much as it is supernatural Ed (Mintz-Plasse) gets gnawed on by a vampire and consequently goes over to the dark (and bloodthirsty) side. This isnt really giving anything away because even if you havent seen Tom Hollands original Fright Night Craig Gillespies (he did Lars and the Real Girl) new take comes off as mostly unsurprising. Perhaps the biggest surprise is that Colin Farrell who has been on a roll lately goes genre-slumming as Jerry the vampire who moves in next door. Charley is convinced early on of Jerrys sinister proclivities but it takes Charleys mother (Toni Collette) a little longer to realize her handsome new neighbor is a fanged fiend. To help him put Jerry down once and for all Charley seeks the counsel of a Vegas showman Peter Vincent (David Tennant) who has incorporated vampiric lore and lusty vampirettes into his act. Tennant plays Vincent like a spoiled rock star holed up in goth digs with his rare Transylvanian artifacts. The deadpan Doctor Who star doesnt really make his presence known until the films third act and things liven accordingly. (I use the word liven loosely though - closing in on a two-hour running time Fright Night can feel eternal.) The films producers are bragging about their 3-D effects - it was shot with stereoscopic technology not digitally retrofitted after the fact. But with the exception of a few stakes and crosses jumping from the screen some bloody sprays here and there and one creepy claustrophobic car ride the 3-D glasses are a hindrance not an enhancement.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Fright Night"" is the best thing to happen to horror movies since red food coloring and Karo syrup. It delivers the weird toxic jolt of adolescent joy that only a first-class creature feature can provide. Energetic suspenseful and delightfully original despite its familiar context it grabs vampire cliches by the neck and shakes them to life. From those Eurotrash nobles Nosferatu and Dracula to ""Twilights"" affluent Cullens vampires are generally portrayed as upscale monsters. One of many ingenious twists here is that the thirsty guy is a pickup-driving T-shirt-wearing construction worker named Jerry whose castle is a suburban Las Vegas tract house. Bram Stoker meet Sams Club. Fingering Colin Farrells character as a bloodsucker isnt a spoiler. This is a monster movie not a mystery. From the moment Farrell flashes his incisors we know this Sun Belt Stanley Kowalski is one dangerous rogue male. His tool-belt machismo mesmerizes his next-door neighbor single mom Jane (Toni Collette) and puts her protective high school son Charley (Anton Yelchin Chekov in J.J. Abrams ""Star Trek"") on alert. But he sees Jerry as a wolf one who gallingly turns Charleys hot girlfriend Amy (Imogen Poots) to a puddle of goo too. Charleys former pal fantasy geek Ed (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) warns that Jerry is a for-real bloodsucker whos behind a rash of student disappearances. Charley retorts that students cut class all the time and besides ""Thats a terrible vampire name Jerry."" When Ed drops off the attendance list Charley seeks help from Peter Vincent a long-haired leather-clad stage magician and self-styled vampire hunter in the mold of Criss Angel. David Tennant (the BBCs 10th Dr. Who) approaches the role with playful zest. The conjurer is an egocentric boozer and a fraud to boot his occult artifacts acquired on eBay. The role seems to have been custom-tailored for Russell Brand but the hyper-energetic Tennant makes it his own. When Sandra Vergara sashays onscreen as his hot-tempered assistant its an uproarious tug of war between two heavyweight scene stealers. Handout Touchstone Pictures Jerry (Colin Farrell) terrorizes Charley (Anton Yelchin) in ""Fright Night."" Screenwriter Marti Noxon (of TVs ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Mad Men"") retooled 1985s hokey ""Fright Night"" for the 21st century adding twists and character notes that keep the jumps and jokes coming. Setting the film in sunbaked Vegas is an inspired touch. Its a place where night-shift workers black out their windows and sleep all day where the transient population provides plenty of midnight snacks and where cellphone coverage drops out on dark lonely stretches of desert highway. Miraculously even the 3-D effects are clever in an enjoyably cheesy sort of way. When Farrell catches an arrow flying toward the viewer its both gimmicky and cleverly self-aware. Yelchin has a rich character to play and works it to the hilt. Hes solid as a likable status-obsessed teen as a frightened underdog and as a fledgling Terminator in Army surplus armor. Hes fine at comedy or drama as required. Farrell one of the most watchable and dynamic actors in the business seemingly recognizes the camp potential of the charming sinister Jerry and has fun bringing him to life. Hes smooth and cool and scary and ferocious and clearly relishes playing a master vampire. His gusto makes the audience love the character even while he scares the Cracker Jack out of them. Farrell is a villainous powerhouse not to be missed. If youre looking for a fun comedy-horror night on the town this movie is right up your dark alley.

(Lorey Sebastian Disney/AP) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday August 18 2011 232 PM Title Fright Night High school kids discover their neighbor is a vampire. With Colin Farrell Anton Yelchin. Director Craig Gillespie (147). R language violence gore. At area theaters.Youll need a taste for nostalgia to really appreciate ""Fright Night"" which knowingly blends Eighties cheese with Nineties snark--a combination that works better than it sounds.Authenticity is the key to the movies success the remake is actually based on a 1985 horror flick and was written by Marti Noxon well known for her work on ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer."" One things for sure if youre expecting the self-serious brooding of ""Twilight"" youre gonna be disappointed.But if you have a soft spot for cult horror comedies like ""The Lost Boys"" ""The Monster Squad"" or even the first ""Fright Night"" this ought to be right up your (dark) alley.Noxon and director Craig Gillespie update the attitude for a post-""Buffy"" generation but their remake is generally faithful to the original. Reformed geek Charley (Anton Yelchin) thinks life is great hes got a hot girlfriend (Imogen Poots) an understanding mom (Toni Collette) and a new set of cool friends. So hes not exactly thrilled when he learns his neighbor Jerry (Colin Farrell) is behind a spate of recent murders. At first Charley ignores the nerdy kid (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) muttering dire warnings of vampirism. But once Jerry catches Charley spying on him it becomes a duel to the death--and the undead guy has a distinct advantage.Gillespies loose approach isnt particularly popular right now but he gets the Eighties B-movie feel down perfectly. Despite some nice camerawork and cool 3D effects the whole attitude is pretty low-key. Everyones having a good time while trying to scare us silly. As often as not the emphasis is on the silly though Gillespie deftly plays up the suspense as well.Yelchin is both a little too passive and a little too old for his role but Mintz-Plasse is terrific and David Tennant channeling Russell Brand as an egomaniacal magician is a camp delight. And there are cameos and references throughout that will have fanboys and girls applauding. But best of all is Farrell who remains a curiously underrated leading man. Grabbing a rare chance to show off hes hilariously dry one minute and terrifying the next. Thanks to him this ""Fright Night"" may even outlast its inspiration as a midnight movie guilty pleasure.  Magic Moment A deserted road becomes the site of a scary showdown--and a surprise appearance.

But its just OK. Im not seeing the level of creativity I would like to see."" Thats Nina Garcia eviscerating another would-be designer on ""Project Runway"" a few weeks ago. But Im quoting Ms. G because she completely nailed my feelings about ""Fright Night"" a remake of the goofy and entertaining 1985 horror-comedy about a teen boy whom no one believes when he claims a vampire moves in next door. In fact the new ""Fright Night"" is actually an improvement in many ways -- its good enough and entertaining enough and scary enough. Its just that by Labor Day youll probably forget you even saw it. The original was shot in a quiet neighborhood that was very obviously a studio backlot but this update features a very specific setting a sun-baked suburb of Las Vegas where former nerd Charley Brewster (Anton Yelchin) lives with his mom Jane (Toni Collette). Since Sin City is known for its nightlife and its transient population what better place for a vampire who wants his crimes to escape notice? Except in this case they dont Ed (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) Charleys onetime best friend -- back when they used to go to ""Farscape"" conventions together -- worries that lots of families in the neighborhood have been disappearing since the charismatic Jerry (Colin Farrell) moved next door to the Brewsters. So of course Ed is convinced that Jerry has been sinking his teeth into the locals. Charley dismisses Eds fears until Ed himself disappears and Charley finds enough evidence to prove that something creepy is going on at Jerrys place. With the help of his girlfriend Amy (Imogen Poots) and flamboyant magician Peter Vincent (David Tennant) -- a Criss Angel/Russell Brand hybrid whos both more and less than he seems in the fearless-vampire-killer department -- Charley sets out to stake the bloodsucker down the street. Screenwriter Marti Noxon a key member of TVs ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" brain trust shows a sure hand in updating the material and in making the characters more interesting than they might have been in the hands of another writer. Charley Amy and Ed feel like fleshed-out interesting teenagers and the notion that Charley would leave his geek roots behind to have a chance with pretty popular Amy makes for an interesting subplot. And while the whole 3D craze just gets more and more annoying director Craig Gillespie (""Lars and the Real Girl"") at least decides to have fun with it hurling crucifixes bricks and gobs of viscera right at the audience. If a movie has to be in 3D let it indulge in shameless paddle-ball-at-the-camera-lens action every so often or whats the point? Gillespies lucky to have such a talented ensemble working with him -- Farrell projects equal parts seduction and menace as the sinister Jerry and Yelchin keeps Charley from ever turning into too much of a chirpy boy scout. Mintz-Plasse and Tennant both get roles that give them license to ham it up but they wisely go big without making it too broad. As the plucky Amy Poots is anything but a helpless victim and even Collette finds some fun in the thankless mom role. (Gillespie directed six episodes of Collettes Showtime series ""The United States of Tara."") So with this much going for it why is ""Fright Night"" simply good and not great? The pacing has a lot to do with it and strangely enough its one of the problems from the original movie (written and directed by Tom Holland) that Noxon cant seem to fix. In both versions theres the confirmation that Jerry is a vampire and theres the final confrontation -- and in between a big chunk of get-on-with-it-already. Its the first movies biggest flaw and its surprising that no one involved with the remake took a whack at it. Still if nothing else ""Fright Night"" confirms what critics have always said -- if Hollywood insists on creating so many remakes leave the classics untouched and take another crack at the just-OK ones instead. This movie may fall into the just-OK category itself but thats still lots better than most horror movies that come slinking into theaters in late August bearing a familiar title and little else of interest.

Daily Edition Login to download Fright Night Film Review 259 PM PDT 8/17/2011 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Dreamworks II This decent remake of the 80s vampire favorite should satiate horror fans. TWITTER A steady supply of spiky humor and a game cast keep director Craig Gillespieas film cooking most of the way says THR film critic Todd McCarthy. The second release in two weeks (after Glee The 3D Concert Movie) to do next to nothing with its 3D format Fright Night is nonetheless a moderately amusing remake of the well-liked 1985 original about a teenager who discovers a vampire has moved in next door. A steady supply of spiky humor and a game cast keep this cooking most of the way though the pacing could have been tighter and the film seems as if its about to end two or three times before it actually does. The Disney release from DreamWorks looks to scare up some tasty box office through the waning days of summer. Largely faithful to Tom Hollands original film right down to the names of the main characters director Craig Gillespie (Lars and the Real Girl) and screenwriter Marti Noxon set the action in a godforsaken tract housing development outside Las Vegas an effectively isolated location that also accommodates the change of the vampire-slayer character from an old Hollywood actor (played by Roddy McDowall 26 years ago) to the goth-garbed star of a gaudy Vegas act (a wonderfully vulgar David Tennant). PHOTOS Fright Night Twilight and Nosferatu The Evolution of Film Vampires This time around Anton Yelchin plays Charley Brewster a good-looking high-schooler who has graduated from geekdom to date comely Amy (Imogen Poots) and warn his horny single mom (Toni Collette) to stay away from Jerry (Colin Farrell) their dramatically handsome new neighbor. ""Thats a terrible vampire name Jerry"" Charley objects to the ultra-dweeby Ed (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) but much as Charley wants to distance himself from his uncool old pal he finally admits that Ed is correct in assigning blame for the disappearance of several students to the dietary preferences of the mysterious newcomer. Fright Night repays its presumed debt to the Twilight franchise for getting remade by cracking jokes about it and it even shares the same cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe with The Twilight Saga New Moon. Far removed from the strict dress code and sense of decorum associated with Bela Lugosi and his Old Europe brethren Jerry is unquestionably a member of the new breed of vampires; he shows hes buff in a tight T-shirt consumes things other than blood (beer and apples at least) doesnt turn into a bat keeps victims in torture rooms in his house and puts little effort into hiding his identity. After 300 years on Earth hes undoubtedly subdued greater foes than the teenage population of this forlorn outpost of humanity. STORY Fright Night Colin Farrell on Playing Sensual Erotic Vampire Desperately seeking a way to kill off the increasingly threatening Jerry Charley approaches the renowned Peter Vincent (Tennant) a behavioral cousin of Russell Brands character in Get Him to the Greek whose Vegas Strip vampire-hunter act has seen better days. Vincent waves off the youngsters claims of having found a real vampire but the dissipated Brit does have the tools needed to turn Jerry to dust. None is quite as arresting as one makeshift weapon with which Charleys mother at one point runs through Jerry -- a Century 21 sign on a post. Talk about creative product placement. All along it seems that the film will contrive to have the vampire finally killed as part of Peters stage show; alas this is not the case. Still lots of good-looking teen characters (as well as a few others) receive punctured necks some are happily resurrected from the purgatory of vampiredom and enough cheeky humor is dispensed to placate the horror-inclined. VIDEO Fright Night Trailer Has Bite Yelchin and Poots make for an attractive lead couple who are keen to lose their virginity but find constant distractions getting in their way. Farrell doesnt have to work hard at it but is both charismatic and quite humorous as the irresistible and ever-resourceful bloodsucker. Seven or eight minutes could have been profitably trimmed from the second half and the score didnt need to pound home every shock. Three-dimensional effects are limited to such silliness as blood and other fluids hurling toward the viewer and stakes and other pointy objects threatening to poke your eyes out.

"Fright Night (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Fright Night (R) Colin Farrell is game as a vicious bloodsucker but the movie lacks bite. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald8/17/2011 Editor rating 2 As a teenager I saw 1985s Fright Night -- about a boy who is convinced his next-door neighbor is a vampire -- and didnt think much of it. And that was before vampires had become ubiquitous. The new remake written by Marti Noxon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and directed by Craig Gillespie (Lars and the Real Girl) has its moments I like the ingenious way imperious bloodsucker Jerry (Colin Farrell) forces his neighbors out of their home so he can confront them. But in the era of Twilight and Let the Right One In and The Vampire Diaries and True Blood were dangerously close to vampire overkill. Theres an irrelevance to the movie that the filmmakers hard as they try cant quite shake - something awfully square about the picture It would have played a lot better a decade ago. Farrells performance as a vicious killer is entertaining -- the actor is great at portraying arrogance and swagger -- but the movie renders his character into something of a blow-hard. If he cant dispatch a nosey adolescent (Anton Yelchin) how much of a threat can he be? Fright Night seems an odd choice for a remake The movie strikes a fine balance between the comical and the serious but whats the point? The plot is predictable  -- you know which characters are expendable and which ones will never meet their doom -- and even though Christopher Mintz-Plasse taking over for Stephen Geoffreys (who went on to become a porn star) as ""Evil Ed"" earns some smiles the feeling of a missed opportunity lingers.Most unbearable of all is David Tennant (in the Roddy McDowall role) as Peter Vincent doing a poor-mans imitation of the odious Russell Brand. Fright Night was shot in 3D which Gillespie uses as a way of making you feel like youre walking around dark rooms and turning corners alongside the characters. The effect is fine but it doesnt add much to a movie that has trouble raising even the slightest of scares. The cast keeps the movie from sinking into true boredom -- Toni Collette plays Yelchins mother -- but there a been-there-done-that aura  that no actor could overcome. I liked the ruthlessness of Farrells Jerry -- hes a mean bastard. that one -- but little else in the picture captures the imagination. Vampires have become the domain of long-form television series where writers have time to explore complex scenarios. Movies like Fright Night feel like more of the same-old. Even if youve not seen the original this one will still have the feel of a remake. Cast Anton Yelchin Colin Farrell David Tennant Toni Collette Christopher Mintz-Plasse Imogen Poots.

Comments click to enlarge Fright Night 3D Video Rated R  106 minutes  2011 In the cult favorite Fright Night (1985) a fatherless schoolboy begins to suspect that the suave new neighbor (Chris Sarandon) flirting with his mom is a vampire; for help the kid turns to a TV horror movie host (Roddy McDowall) who claims to be a fearless vampire killer. This remake is good fun aided in no small degree by Colin Farrells strutting dead-eyed performance as the bloodsucker and Christopher Mintz-Plasses early appearance as a geeky classmate of the heros who falls prey to Farrells nocturnal appetites (director Craig Gillespie wisely retains the original movies make-up design with its awful rictus of fangs). The big innovation here is moving the action to Las Vegas and turning the vampire expert into a decadent hotel-lounge performer; unfortunately actor David Tennant best known for playing Doctor Who on the BBC lacks the star wattage the role demands.

(AP Photo/DreamWorks Pictures - Disney Lorey Sebastian) John Bramley In this film image released by Disney-DreamWorks Pictures Anton Yelchin stars as Charley Brewster in DreamWorks Pictures horror film ""Fright Night."" (AP Photo/DreamWorks Pictures - Disney John Bramley) In the middle of the 80s slasher-movie frenzy was an old-fashioned vampire flick ""Fright Night"" considered a semiclassic in horror circles complete with wooden stakes a vampire hunter and a comedic twist.A new remake serves ""Fright Night"" well. It honors the original throughout including a memorable nightclub scene and a surprise cameo thats a huge crowd-pleaser while at the same time giving updates to make it fresher and better than ever.The story still revolves around nice-guy teen Charley (Anton Yelchin) who brushes off a claim by his friend Ed (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) that a vampire has moved in to their suburban Las Vegas neighborhood. Despite the disappearance of several of their classmates Charley tells Ed that hes been reading too much ""Twilight."" Turns out that hunky new neighbor Jerry (Colin Farrell) lives next door to Charley in a home with blacked-out windows. And Vampire Jerry as he is jokingly referred to in one of many funny bits is out for blood.After Ed disappears Charley goes through his friends computer and watches surveillance clips Ed filmed of Jerry. A scene in which Jerry tries to get Charley to invite him in to his house under the pretense of borrowing beer is a hoot. (Vampires cant enter a home unless theyre invited but you know that.)Peter Vincent (David Tennant) a flashy showman fronting an elaborate vampire-hunting spectacle on a Vegas stage is enlisted to stop Jerry. Tennants Peter is a far cry from Roddy McDowells earlier campier take on the role; Tennant plays it in a Russell Brand sort of way. Director Craig Gillespies ""Fright Night"" available in 3-D that works in spots and is unnecessary in others is likable and fast-moving thanks to some major restructuring of the story. Fans of the original may see some of the plot points including the vampire reveal as coming much too soon but the film should be credited for not dragging out the obvious.As for that cameo which plays out in a well-shot car chase thats the movies 3D highlight lets just say the filmmakers couldnt have done better.

"Fright Night | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; fright-night ) Fright Night (United Kingdom/United States 2011) August 17 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Tom Hollands 1985 Fright Night was as much a love letter to horror fans weaned on Creature Double Feature as a legitimate genre entry - an imperfect yet entertaining vampire yarn that combined shocks gore camp and humor into a whole. Some 26 years after its theatrical release it stands up nearly as well as it did during its first run which makes a remake a cause for head scratching. Aside from some cosmetic changes little of what this Fright Night offers elevates it above the classification of ""unnecessary."" If a comment is to be made in its defense at least sun-kissed vampires burst into flame rather than sparkle. The element lost upon director Craig Gillespie and screenwriter Marti Nixon is that although Charley Brewster may be the hero and Jerry the villain the heart and soul of Fright Night is Peter Vincent. In the 1985 movie he was the most interesting individual and had the only compelling character arc. Roddy McDowall owned the movie; his portrayal made Hollands production more than just a routine monster movie. The most grievous misjudgment in the 2011 version is the decision to marginalize Vincent. While the casting choice of ex-Doctor Who David Tennant to replace the late McDowall is at least intriguing (if not necessarily inspired) the screenplay reduces him to a colorful supporting entity. With Vincent limited to the role of forgettable sidekick the conflict between Charley (Anton Yelchin) and Jerry (Colin Farrell) absorbs the entirety of the movies focus and its a distressingly generic struggle. If there was a brilliant conceit in the 1985 Fright Night it was that Vincent a TV horror movie host was forced to face down in real life the creatures he dispatched with ease on television. According to Gillespie TV monster movie hosts are things of the past so he re-imagined Peter Vincent as a Las Vegas magician with a supernatural shtick. However a TV horror host like a news anchor and unlike a vampire is regularly invited into our homes; we become comfortable with him. Not so with a Vegas showman. In the original it was no stretch to believe that Charley confronted with a vampire living next door would seek out Vincent. In the remake it takes a huge leap of faith to accept that Charley would go in search of Vincent in the first place and an even bigger stretch to think he would capture the self-absorbed illusionists attention. The underlying premise hasnt changed much although there are plenty of new wrinkles. Charley is an average teenager who has put aside his geeky past along with his former best friend Ed (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) in order to hang with the cool crowd. He lives alone with his mom (Toni Collette); his dad having split at some unspecified time in the past when the going got tough. He has an impossibly hot girlfriend Amy (Imogen Poots) who is far too good looking for someone like Charley to be kissing and fondling (although they havent gone any farther). Then Jerry moves in next door. At first theres nothing threatening about the guy hes tall dark and handsome. Sure he only comes out at night but this is Vegas. Charleys suspicions are aroused when he doesnt show up on camera or in mirrors. Of course its not just that Charley knows but that Jerry knows Charley knows. Realizing he needs some help he arranges a meeting with Peter Vincent who turns out to be little more than a liquor-swilling fake. Those in search of an old school vampire movie - fangs crosses stakes through the heart and so forth - will find all the ingredients here. To its credit Fright Night is no Twilight (it even makes fun of the trendy books/movies). Jerry is a traditional vampire although not nearly as interesting as the night crawlers populating the recent Let the Right One In and its English-language counterpart Let Me In. Farell plays the character as more of an implacable monster than as the creepily charming bloodsucker that Chris Sarandon (who has a cameo here) brought to the screen. Sarandons Jerry had a sardonic edge; Farells is just a badass. The storyline has been streamlined. Ed is dispensed with (for the most part) early in the proceedings. Jerry no longer is co-habiting with anyone (unless you count his playthings/snacks). And Amy does not remind him of a lost love; she merely represents a tasty way to lure Charley into a trap. Other than the unforgivable downsizing of Peter Vincents importance the story proceeds in much the same way it did in the original with Charley and Jerrys cat-and-mouse game seeming like a mismatch until the end. Another issue is not unexpectedly the 3-D. Its shoddy work and it degrades the viewing experience. I can understand re-doing a foreign film in English (I dont always agree with it but I understand it) or updating something old and decrepit (ditto) but theres nothing inaccessible about the original Fright Night; the remake seems like a lazy cash grab with the 3-D acting as grotesque and gaudy ornamentation. Any special qualities one could ascribe to the 1985 movie have been lost in translation.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Some of the most chilling visuals in Fright Night--a new remake of Tom Hollands well-liked self-aware 1985 vampire movie--come not when the blood starts spurting and the stakes start flying but from the images of a desolate suburban oasis that appear near the opening of the film. Just a few uniform blocks surrounded by desert darkness and the distant lights of Las Vegas the setting suggests a nice normal place where unspeakable things could transpire without the world at large noticing--and where those directly affected might be too dulled by the blanketing blandness to save themselves. Thats more or less what happens when a nice high-school kid (Anton Yelchin) fails to suspect that his new next-door neighbor (Colin Farrell) might be the reason so many fellow students have stopped showing up for school in the morning. To be fair he has his reasons for not noticing. Too distracted by the pressure of dating a classmate (Imogen Poots) above his social station Yelchin ignores the warnings of his one-time best friend Christopher Mintz-Plasse an unrepentant nerd whos had his eye on Farrell for a while and has come to a chilling conclusion ""Hes the fucking shark from Jaws."" Trouble is Farrell has had his eye out too. Directed by Craig Gillespie (Lars And The Real Girl) from a screenplay by Marti Noxon a Buffy The Vampire Slayer veteran Fright Night works reasonably well as a scary movie. Though some of his work gets muddied in 3-D Gillespie knows how to stage shocks gore and action sequences--including a long car chase that borrows liberally from a famous scene in Children Of Men. But the films greatest pleasures come from Noxons script--which puts the sexual chaos created by Farrells attractive bloodsucker front and center--and from the performances. Former Doctor Who star David Tennant has a plum role as a Criss Angel-like Vegas cheeseball whose vampire-themed stage show might hide a special connection to vampire lore. Its a big fun performance overshadowed only by Farrell who plays his character as a monster whos learned to use an ordinary-dude exterior to blend in with his new surroundings. When he asks Yelchin for a ""sixer"" Farrell delivers his lines with a Matt Dillon-like flatness but his eyes tell another story Beneath the surface hes all coiled hunger and pitiless manipulation doing what he has to do to get close to victims who against their better judgment want to get close to him. He creates almost unbearable tension by doing virtually nothing at all and though Fright Night eventually reveals him as the vampire equivalent of the fucking shark from Jaws its never better than when it lets him poke his fin just above the surface.

Just when it seems that every other young Hollywood actor is donning vampire garb along comes Colin Farrell to show em how its done in ""Fright Night"" a cleverly balanced mix of scares and laughs that is funnier and more terrifying than the 1985 original on which its based. The storys shift from corn-fed Iowa to recession-plagued Vegas is an indicator of where ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" writer Marti Noxons screenplay is headed but the pics timeliness is only one factor in a B.O. perf that should send chills down the spine of the weekend competition. Tom Hollands original pic best remembered for Chris Sarandon as the alluring vampire Jerry but hobbled by archness and overacting was an early contributor to the mock-horror trend that finally tilted over into ""Screams"" spoofery. In every department the redo reps an effort to rebalance the tone in a much edgier scarier direction while steering away from camp. In the casting alone director Craig Gillespies production marks an improvement bringing in top-flight thesps including Anton Yelchin Imogen Poots Christopher Mintz-Plasse David Tennant and Toni Collette alongside Farrells vampire Jerry a picture of sexual animalism that may end up on many a teen girls bedroom wall. Stuck in a suburban tract on Vegas fringes high schooler Charley (Yelchin) lives with real-estate agent mom Jane (Collette) and has finally outlived his geeky years to attract boy magnet Amy (Poots) who genuinely adores Charley. In his shift from square to hip though Charley has left behind longtime pal Ed (Mintz-Plasse) whos come to resent Charley and his growing resemblance to school jerks like Mark (Dave Franco) and Ben (Reid Ewing). At the same time Charley hasnt fully abandoned his geekdom (especially as played by Yelchin capturing his transition from innocence to maturity) so when Ed fears a real vampire may be in their midst the push-pull tension Charley feels is real and personal. This concern jibes with the presence of new next-door neighbor Jerry whose front-yard dumpster and latenight activity draw Janes curiosity as well as reports of killings in the area. Noxon has made some crucial improvements to Hollands original story particularly in making Charley the skeptic (hes now too cool to believe in such boyhood nonsense) and Ed the true believer who ironically ends up being one of Jerrys early victims. While Mintz-Plasse fans may lament his fairly early departure (albeit with a mightily altered reappearance later) it all serves the movies dramatic purposes. Just as welcome is the change of having Jerry living single here served by a minimalist suburban look (in production designer Richard Bridgland Fitzgeralds smart work) that eliminates the easy cliches of vampire Gothic. The notion that vampires might be attracted to a city full of people who work night shifts only adds to Jerrys terrifying credibility. The original pics notion that only famed vampire killer Peter Vincent (played by Roddy McDowall) could destroy Jerry is far more entertaining here with Vincent as a Vegas act played by Tennant as a wasted Brit rocker in ultra-tight leather pants. Pic is distinguished by some strong individual sequences such as a chase in an SUV down a highway or the capper in Jerrys fairly horrifying basement. Gillespie a cable pro who recently helmed Collette in ""The United States of Tara"" arranges some elegant sharply drawn scenes and sequences that bring the characters sometimes lost in this genre into high relief. The cast led by Yelchin sets an early tone of emotional credibility that allows for the horror-comedy to reach its full potential. As in the original Farrells Jerry is in his own world casting a strong swarthy spell as in a scene at the threshold of Charleys house that amounts to a film acting clinic. Pics tech team is just as unified with gifted d.p. Javier Aguirresarobe accentuating the creepy possibilities of desert nights and editor Tatiana S. Riegel keenly ramping up or turning down the tension as a scene merits. Once again 3D brings little to the party Only a few explosions and sudden bursts pay off optically and the overall image is dimmed by the process a chronic problem that at the end of the day makes 2D preferable.

Fright Night Fair to good Director Craig Gillespie. Cast Anton Yelchin Colin Farrell David Tennant. Rating R for bloody horror violence and language including sexual references. This weeks new movie releases Vampire hunks Vampire movies Its a somewhat goofy movie that also manages some real scares. Best of all it makes excellent use of an element of vampire stories effective since Count Dracula confronted Van Helsing in Bram Stokers novel I know that you know and I also know there is nothing you can do about it. Although there are many things to like about ""Fright Night"" Craig Gillespies update of Hollands film theres not enough of that tease of that toying with the impotent believer. Gillespie cuts to the chase too soon. Interview Colin Farrell Hotlist Top 10 regular kids in movies That said Colin Farrell makes an excellent vampire arrogant with the knowledge that he has survived 400 years so a teenage boy putting an end to him is unlikely. And Anton Yelchin is also good as Charley a teenager faking his way through a newfound coolness by trading up for less-geeky friends realizing too late the value of the pal he left by the fanboy wayside. The story is now set in Las Vegas where Charley lives with his mom Jane (Toni Collette) a real-estate agent in a subdivision. Charley has recently jettisoned his childhood friend Ed (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and has managed to land a beautiful girlfriend Amy (Imogen Poots). The setting is a great update - Las Vegas is a transient community anyway and the crash of the housing market has made it only more so so no one pays much attention when a kid doesnt show up for school for several days. His family probably just moved on. But Ed has other ideas. He believes a vampire is killing the missing kids - and that he lives next door to Charley. Jerry (Farrell) does keep to himself for the most part - he works nights - but hes handsome and a little flirty with Jane. Charley thinks Ed is crazy that hes still living out the fantasy game the two of them played as kids. But events will quickly change his mind. Too quickly. Jerry doesnt torment Charley enough. Instead before you know it Charley is defending his mother and Amy from Jerry. As in the original Charley seeks help from a faux expert. In the first film it was an inspired Roddy McDowall as a down-on-his-luck former host of a local TV horror show. This time its Peter Vincent (David Tennant) a hack with an over-the-top magic show on the Strip clearly modeled on Criss Angel - another clever update. Peter doesnt want to help but the fight comes to him. From there its pretty standard stuff for films of this sort. Farrell is so good at playing characters with a lack of morals or decency that Jerry is a perfect role for him. Its great fun watching him simply kill indiscriminately because he knows he can. Whos going to stop him? And Yelchin is also good as a kid forced to defend his turf. The scenes in which Charley does confront Jerry like when Jerry shows up on his doorstep to borrow some beer and Charley carefully avoids inviting him in - vampire rules - are the best in the movie. Its just too bad that Gillespie doesnt give us more of them. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter twitter.com/goodyk.
