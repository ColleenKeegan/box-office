Mark Wahlberg plays Irish Mickey Ward the working-class slugger from Lowell Massachusetts whose rough road to sporting stardom in the mid-90s was both helped and hindered by his ex-boxer brother Dicky (Christian Bale) and his tough-cookie manager mother Alice (Melissa Leo). The most notable thing about The Fighter is its extreme and at times offputting diversity of acting styles Wahlberg holds himself back as the quiet man at the eye of the storm but  Bales twitchy tweaked-out crackhead is as out-there a character as hes ever portrayed while both Leo and Amy Adams are on full scenery-chewing form as the sharp-tongued mad-haired leopard-print-clad women who rule Mickeys life. Director David O Russell (Three Kings) does a decent job of holding things together but some scenes feel more like a thespian pissing contest than a representation of anything like real life a situation not helped by some of the more laboured class-conscious Barton Fink-isms in the script.But The Fighter is still a hugely entertaining watch romping through its rags-to-slightly-better-rags plot with aplomb throwing in a few brief but breathless boxing sequences some superbly sketched (and terrifyingly dressed) supporting characters and a lot of snappy street-smart dialogue. Russells visual sense is as strong as ever creating a vivid heightened portrait of ground-level life in what was then one of Americas roughest neighbourhoods. The result is a flawed frequently ludicrous but overwhelmingly likeable film old-school to the core and none the worse for it.

The reason I ended up seeing it is that it ended up showing at my local cinema and was the only non kids film for abot 2 weeks (I live in Cornwall - land of no multiplexes) so was straving Long story short despite a predicatable story arc I thought the characterisation was sharp the sisters the mother the gnarly Amy Adams and even mark Walhberg who I generally thinks puts in weak performances. His whiney schtick really worked in this though. Christian Bale was predictably good but I wasn;t expecting him to be funny which was a plus. There was a lot of humour in this film. This and the details of the neighbourhood (Lowell Boston) and the characters made it very watchable... Not the unwanted WRESTLER clone I expected it to be...FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 15 2011HollandMovieLoverFeaturedI caught one of the previews of this brilliant movie last weekend in the local cinema and was completely blown away by the acting of the whole cast and not just Christian Bale Mark Wahlberg Amy Adams and Melissa Leo who were of course all outstanding in their respective roles. One of the best movies of 2010/2011 as far as I am concerned together with The Kings Speech Black Swan Winters Bone The Social Network and True GritFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 6 2011Thomas NoctorFeaturedAverage movie Bale was excellent. Wahlberg was poor True story or not this was always going to be compared to Rocky. I think thats why Bales character was so funny. However I did enjoy it at times and it is definatley worth a watch. Good FilmFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyFeb 25 2011JoeFeaturedWorth seeing for Christian Bales wacky messed-up amp; often hilarious performance. Rest of the film sadly is fairly average. Wahlberg is quite lame in this and the family feuding quickly becomes tiresome; the mother figure being especially irritating and not very believable. The fight sequences are a bit daft as most of the time the boxers fight without moving like statues. However Bales acting as the screwed-up crackhead brother Mickey is hysterically good and easily steals the show.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyFeb 23 2011BobbyMFeaturedThis film is just charming sweeps you alongFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyFeb 12 2011pgFeaturedamazing film actors are absolutely fantastic (amy adams irresistible).FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyFeb 12 2011pgFeaturedamazing film actors are absolutely fantastic (amy adams irresistible).FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyFeb 9 2011Justin BerkoviFeaturedFor once I find myself agreeing with TIMEOUT. Im a huge Mark Wahlberg fan but I found him to be weak in this film. Perhaps the problem with The Fighter is that Bales performance is so brilliant that it eclipses everything else even the fight scenes. It is a likeable film with the best intentions and I do advise going to see it even if for Bales performance alone but I cant help thinking that without Bale the film would have been quite tedious. Wahlberg seems to sleep through his role and at time seems awkward in character - this may very well be the role hes meant to play but on film it disrupts the flow of the film and the contrasting in acting as the reviewer mentioned DOES sometimes lend the film to a jerkiness in narrative that doesnt work at times. The issue that bothered me the most was that whilst Wahlberg seemed to be a pensive slow burner of a character the music in many cases didnt fit the scene. Perhaps a more brooding introspective soundtrack would have been more fitting - it seemed that his character internalised a lot of his pain with his family / his situation and a rocky type rock soundtrack just didnt work. Saying all of this its always enjoyable to see Wahlberg on the screen and the final scene with Bale was the most moving 20 seconds of the film he deserves an Oscar nod in my opinion.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyFeb 8 2011CraigganmoreFeaturedThe ratings given to a film are always relative so after being bored stupid by The Hereafter and patronised by The Kings Speech (I have a stammer too) my hopes were up for The Fighter and in my opinion it floors the other two films in straight knock outs. Who can resist a boxing pun eh? Certainly not me. I found the film to be a revelation and I cant find any reason to give it less than 5 stars. Watch Micky Ward and Dicky Eklund online and the way theyre portrayed in this movie is spot on. Dicky is in your face Micky is reserved to play it any other way wouldnt tell the story. The boxing scenes bleed realism the crack smoking scenes glow with despondency and the whole bullying scene around Micky would make anybody want to hit someone. No wonder he took up boxing with a family like that. A great film and if Christian doesnt get an Oscar for his portrayal of Dicky Eklund hell have every right to feel cheated. Mark Wahlberg punches way above his weight (sorry) returning to the acting form that saw him become famous with Boogie Nights. If you dont see this film youll miss a treat.

Bale steals the film hands down and should win an Oscar. The sound of this film in the first hour is nothing less than sensational.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Dec. 17 2010 1200AM EST Last updated Thursday Dec. 30 2010 434PM EST Comments AA Country USA Language English Of all the sports the most brutal breeds the best writing and the best movies. A.J. Liebling Norman Mailer Joyce Carol Oates each has turned boxings cruel dynamic into eloquent prose. On the screen from Somebody Up There Likes Me through Requiem for a Heavyweight to Fat City the essential melodrama of the ring - the loss of innocence the scars of experience - make for reliable dramatic fodder. And of course in the hands of Martin Scorsese Raging Bull became a great directors greatest film. Although also based on a true story The Fighter isnt in that class. The picture makes too many concessions to the Hollywood judges pulls too many punches. But at least it has real punches to pull because theres honest sweat here too and a full complement of those archetypes that lie at the popular heart of the genre. After all every tale of a champion boxer is a parable of the underclass where the heros blue-collar toughness and street smarts earn him a graduate degree in the school of hard knocks. So armed he may rise only to fall but its the ascent that counts - the barriers of class and the gates of fame broken down however temporarily at the business end of his fists. This is no different. When we first meet Dicky Eklund and Micky Ward in their gritty home town of Lowell Mass. the half brothers are at very different rounds in their pro careers. Once a flashy boxer Dicky (Christian Bale) had his moment of glory knocking down Sugar Ray Leonard but since then hes spent years duking it out with crack cocaine. Still active in the ring the younger one (Mark Wahlberg) couldnt be more different. In contrast to his motor-mouth sibling Micky is quiet disciplined withdrawn with zero flash but a helluva body punch. Yes hes less a boxer than a fighter. Unfortunately hes also a fighter bullied by a wayward family badly trained by his scatterbrained bro and mismanaged by his bottle-blonde spandex-wearing gin-swilling mother (Melissa Leo). Sure they mean well but in their hands Micky has become merely an opponent a ""stepping stone"" for up-and-comers. Early on during a mismatch in Vegas he gets brutally stepped on by a guy 20 pounds heavier returning home with a pulpy face and a fervent vow ""I dont want to do this no more."" Happily into his corner sashays the sexy Charlene soon to become the love of his life and thanks to Amy Adamss finely tuned work the woman who steals the picture. Shes a bartender with brains and moxie and a quick-witted knack for shooting from the lip backed up with a mean left hook of her own - in short a beguiling variation on the lunch-pail stereotype. Charlene convinces Micky to take on new management whereupon the film settles into its twin-battles - his pugilistic struggle to climb up the rankings and the domestic battle with his crazy family. The first is terrific. Wahlbergs performance is appealingly low-key outside the ring and credibly athletic inside where director David O. Russell shoots the fight sequences without Scorseses poetic flourishes but with something almost as good a clear-eyed no-nonsense documentary panache. The brutal spectacle is perfectly caught as is the attendant tackiness - like the Vegas sexpot in high heels who too eager to showcase herself holding up that card with the round number gets stuck wiggling through the ropes. But the second battle the domestic stuff flirts with farce. That shrill mom along with her brood of seven overblown and overgrown daughters (they could be the seven anti-dwarfs) come off like outtakes from The Jerry Springer Show just white-trash cliches. Similarly mannered is Bales look-at-me take on Dicky. Hes way too into the role; its so upper-case ACTING. As for the big-fight finish an ostensible title bout in distant London boxing fans will know that the climax is fixed. That match wasnt where Micky Ward earned his sterling reputation. But movie fans wont care and should be roused. Score it then a split-decision victory since The Fighter does what any cinematic fighter must - shed his blood to win our hearts.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Surviving a barrage of blows and waiting patiently to begin a counterattack is a recurring theme in ""The Fighter."" And were not talking about a strategy at work only in the boxing ring once the bell sounds. Yes the sweet science gets its due in director David O. Russells bruising -- and at times wincingly amusing -- boxing drama. But so does the bittersweet mystery of familial boundaries. ""The Fighter"" is so muscularly and tenderly good because it trains its eye on the matches that take place between kin. It deals with both authentic pride and the hubris that comes from reflected glory -- and it traces the weird border between the two. Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale portray brothers Micky Ward and Dicky Eklund. The screenplay by Scott Silver Paul Tamasy and Eric Johnson is based on the real-life pugilists who hail from Lowell Mass. a once- robust textile center. ""The Fighter"" opens in that hardscrabble burg in 1993. Dicky (Bale) sits on a couch nattering into a camera. A few minutes into his monologue quieter brother Micky joins him. Dicky is a live wire in need of grounding. An HBO camera crew is shooting a documentary about the former boxer who became ""The Pride of Lowell"" when he bested Sugar Ray Leonard in a match. He believes theyre there to cover his comeback. All we have to do is look at Dickys bad teeth his glazed eyes his loss of muscle mass to know theres no boxing-ring revival in store. Is Dicky delusional? Is he on crack? Why yes he is. At 23 Eklund started smoking rock cocaine. ""The Fighter"" doesnt obsess over dazzling footwork or fluid bobbing and weaving. But if Wahlbergs depiction of Micky is accurate -- and Ward has said as much -- the boxer took a lot of hits. He did not float like a butterfly though he did do more than sting with a helluva left hook. When we meet Micky though his role is mostly that of the overshadowed brother of Dicky and short-shrifted son of Alice (Melissa Leo) even though hes the only boxer in the family with any prospects. Alice manages him. Dicky trains him. Its more complicated than a conflict of interest but just as dangerous. At a match in Vegas Micky gets pounded. Alice and Dicky are impervious to his shame. But Micky has saner people in his corner. Amy Adams is Charlene a bartender with insight into how damaging Mickys family is to his plans. A college dropout she also knows how easily dreams can be deferred. OKeefe is the scrappy Irish cop who helps train Micky and believes the boxer must cut his ties with Dicky and Alice if he hopes to have a career. Hes portrayed by Mickey OKeefe the actual Lowell policeman who trained Ward. Leo is frightfully good as Alice. We mean she scares us. Shes manipulative and protective. Shes an enabler. Shes judgmental. She can growl or weep on a dime. In addition to enlisting OKeefe Russell cast some of the Ward Eklund sisters to play themselves. Sitting in Alices home with beers cigs and too much time on their hands they come off as some unholy alliance a coven. Much of the films biting humor comes during faceoffs between Mickys sisters his mother and Charlene. To her credit Charlene lands a number of sharp punch lines. Once again Bale has taken a physical transformation seriously. He disappears into Dick Eklunds crack-ravaged physique and addict psyche. But dont think that this means Bales fierce energy eclipses Wahlbergs determined work. Long attached to the project and a producer on the film Wahlberg is an eager sparring partner. Hes a contender in his own right.

I missed fluidity in The Fighter and found those music montages being to much and ruining the pace. Agree on everything else.

It may even make my Top 40 or 50 Sarasaid on Wednesday January 19 2011 121024 PMI just saw it over the weekend and I agree with every word you said. This deserves a LOT of Oscars Christian Bale blew me away. He stole the whole movie and he completely became Dickey. This is the best role hes had. By the end of the movie the whole audience was almost on their feet during the last fight. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. George B. Feist (Duke)said on Saturday December 25 2010 105901 AMI really enjoyed the movie after its depressing rocky start...Bale should win many awards for this zack said on Thursday December 23 2010 113923 PMCouldnt agree more with you on this review. I love how you point out some of the humor. michaelsaid on Tuesday December 21 2010 114301 AMDid you agree with the R rating? I thought it was PG-13 in spite of repeated use of famp;% as an adjective in many forms. Granted there are dysfunctional adults and drug use but we have that content on several television channels already. Maybe a better questiin would be if the ratings as adults and Hollywood have come to know them are still relevant. Michaelsaid on Monday December 20 2010 104304 PMLiked the supporting performances and would recommend this film only because of them. I thought the fight scenes were badly shot the scene in prison where inmates watch Christian Bales documentary expecting to view a fight with such loose supervision ridiculous and Mark Wahlberg did nothing to make me care about Irish Mickey Ward who he portrayed. But there were three fine supporting roles that made the film worth seeing. This film is a slice of life tale like Jerry Macguire with a much worse lead character but better supporting ones and Jerry Macguire had good supporting roles. Stephen said on Monday December 20 2010 20733 PMHey Richard what did you think of Eberts review Brian Christensensaid on Friday December 17 2010 62006 PMMark Wahlberg talks about slapping me out on Conan OBrien http//www.tbs.com/video/conan.jsp?oid=238204amp;eref=sharethisUrl writingprincesssaid on Friday December 17 2010 60705 PMRichard you are spot on The Fighter was the best movie of the year filled with heart drama comedy and some amazing performances. Christian Bales time has come He has proven that he is one of the greatest. After seeing the real Dicky in an interview I am even more dumbfounded as I couldnt tell the difference between Bale and the real life guy. Amazing amazing story and performances that spills over with drama but it is the quiet moments such as the one with Dicky and Alice singing in the car outside the crackhouse that make this film worth seeing. Amazing amazing beyond 5 stars POST A COMMENT indicates required fieldName Email Website YouTubeResponse URL  ? Comment Enter text as shown NOTE Your comment will be approved before it is posted.

By Peter Rainer Film critic December 10 2010 Save for later Saved Mark Wahlberg (l.) and Christian Bale are shown in a scene from the film The Fighter. Courtesy of Paramount Pictures          View Caption About video ads View Caption of David O. Russells ""The Fighter"" starring Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale is an in-your-face - more exactly in-your-eyes-and-ears - movie about a celebrated real-life blue-collar boxing family.Once more as in ""The Wrestler"" we have in our midst a movie about fighting as - what else? - metaphor. To its credit unlike ""The Wrestler"" the metaphor often takes a back seat to the fighting though not nearly enough for my taste. (For me the best fight movie of the year remains Frederick Wisemans documentary ""Boxing Gym"" where the fighting isnt a metaphor for anything - its simply fighting.)Wahlbergs ""Irish"" Micky Ward is a junior welterweight from Lowell Mass. whose career as managed by his scabrous mom Alice (Melissa Leo) and cokehead trainer and older half brother Dicky Eklund (Bale) is rocky (and ""Rocky"") at best. Dicky is both Mickys idol and nemesis. Ravaged as he is he still knows more about boxing than just about anybody else. What he doesnt begin to know is how to manage his own life. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Before he became a habitue of crack houses Dicky was himself a contender who fought memorably against Sugar Ray Leonard. Now hes being followed around by an HBO documentary crew for what we are initially led to believe is a movie about his ""comeback"" but is actually an installment in a series on lives wrecked by drugs. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Russell along with his screen-writers Scott Silver Paul Tamasy and Eric Johnson keeps all these characters in a perpetual state of hectic imbalance. The fighters knockabout lives are all of a piece inside and outside the ring.Micky and Dicky never quite know from moment to moment where the next punch will be coming from but we do. Thats because weve already seen many of the boxing movies - from ""The Set-Up"" and ""Somebody Up There Likes Me"" to ""Rocky"" and ""Raging Bull"" - that ""The Fighter"" draws on.Because so many of those movies are so enjoyable ""The Fighter"" is not without its pedigreed pleasures. Russell films Mickys ascent up the boxing ladder as a series of face-offs with the no-frills immediacy of cable TV smackdowns. He saves the best the title shot for last. (What he leaves out entirely are the subsequent historic trilogy of fights against Arturo Gatti that constitute Mickys homeboy legend.)Whenever ""The Fighter"" moves away from the ring it loses its bearings - and its verity. Mickys extended family beginning with his mother is a screeching caricature of working-class discombobulation. His seven sisters for example are a recurring Greek chorus of chain-smoking couch potatoes.As a fighter Micky was known for taking great punishment in the ring before going on the offensive and unleashing his lethal left hook but hes no match for the women in his family. This chink in his armor could have been funny but was it necessary to make the women so annoyingly obtuse? Since when is ""blue collar"" synonymous with ""stunted""?Dicky is equally annoying despite Bales full-on performance because his mania never varies. Wahlbergs good-guy proletarian routine is also unchanging. Like Micky Wahlberg is a counterpuncher performer and because hes surrounded by a gaggle of high-flying overactors he tends to recede into the scenery.Only Amy Adams playing Mickys tough-tender girlfriend Charlene manages to be convincingly working-class without seeming either dopey or rabid or strung-out. Not many actresses could play with equal success a wide-eyed Disney princess (in ""Enchanted"") and as she does here a tough-cookie bar hostess. She has become an actress of remarkable range.A cross between a boxing biopic and a paean to working-class heroism ""The Fighter"" doesnt quite make the weight class in either category.The filmmakers are so intent on deifying Micky that they never stop to question whether all those beatings he received and handed out were worth the human cost.His life has been retrofitted into the Hollywood legend machine.

The film features excellent performances by Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale. Starring Christian Bale Mark Wahlberg Amy Adams Melissa Leo Robert Wahlberg Dendrie Taylor Jack McGee Jenna Lamia Salvatore Santone Chanty Sok Director David O. Russell Release Opened Dec 17 2010  Editorial Review A tough tale told with tendernessBy Ann HornadayFriday December 17 2010If you think ""Rocky"" and ""Raging Bull"" define the alpha and omega of boxing movies think again. David O. Russells ""The Fighter"" proves theres still punch in the genre especially when a filmmaker tells a familiar story in a brand-new way. In this case the story is based on a true one. In the 1970s welterweight boxer Dicky Eklund known as the ""Pride of Lowell"" made local history in that working-class Massachusetts city by sending Sugar Ray Leonard to the mat. Later lost in a vortex of drug addiction and running petty hustles Dicky trained his half-brother Micky Ward eventually to a world welterweight championship. The title character of ""The Fighter"" might be Micky - played here in a straight-up stalwart hugely sympathetic performance by Mark Wahlberg. But it could just as easily pertain to the hardscrabble Dicky especially as hes channeled by Christian Bale. Down 30 pounds Bale is nothing less than revelatory as the skinny skeeved-out crackhead who against all odds commands the audiences affection and improbably a few laughs. Filmed like an HBO boxing documentary ""The Fighter"" possesses the light-footed dexterity and spontaneity of the most sensitive pugilist circling its characters with equal parts discretion and confrontational zeal. Just as its ambiguous who the Fighter is in ""The Fighter"" its difficult to pin down which fight its protagonists are waging. On one level Russell constructs a classic come-from-behind story of focus discipline and triumph as Micky puts his head down and with the love of a pugnacious redhead named Charlene (Amy Adams) goes for the gold. On another level ""The Fighter"" chronicles how Micky fought free of the sprawling mostly female family that exploited him and kept him back - mostly at the hands of his domineering mother Alice (an unrecognizably teased-and-bleached Melissa Leo). And on yet another level ""The Fighter"" is about Dickys fight to overcome the demons that threatened to destroy not only him but also the brother he holds dear. The filial tensions and loyalties that drive ""The Fighter"" form its most meaningful core especially as theyre brought to life by Wahlberg and Bale each of whom disappears into his character with uncanny ease. ""The Fighter"" isnt just about one or two men as captivating as they are but about Lowells own scrappy post-industrial milieu. The atmospherics are flawless When the sweating strung-out Dicky is sparring and cracking wise with his addict friends in a seedy apartment Russell films it with such vividness you can almost feel the heat outside. As manic as Dicky is Micky is just as quiet and self-effacing. Although Bale gets the juiciest scenes Wahlberg makes just as big an impact with fewer jacked-up flourishes - like when he takes Charlene to ""Belle Epoque"" (which he pronounces ""epicue"") and when a fellow theater patron mentions that the cinematography is supposed to be beautiful he responds with a shy ""Oh cool."" Zing are sure to go the strings of viewers hearts at that moment. And luckily the filmmakers treat our emotional investment with respect and unexpected tenderness. As pathologically dysfunctional as the Eklund-Ward clan is - thanks in large part to Alices toxic mix of denial and ferocious protectiveness - Russell chooses not to demonize the tribe. Instead ""The Fighter"" becomes a tough bare-knuckled compassionate meditation on every familys rope-a-dope between tribal bonds and self-definition. Both it turns out are worth going to the mat for.Contains profanity drug content violence and sexuality.

Photo Jojo Whilden Paramount Pictures The Fighter review Actors pack a punch 1 / 4 Back to Gallery The Fighter Drama. Starring Mark Wahlberg Christian Bale Melissa Leo and Amy Adams. Directed by David O. Russell. (R. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""The Fighter"" is entertaining from beginning to end and contains two brilliant and extreme supporting performances that are among the years best. The milieu of working class Lowell Mass. is re-created in rich detail and Mark Wahlberg as real-life welterweight Micky Ward is an engaging locus of audience sympathy. No one will walk out of ""The Fighter"" thinking this is anything less than a quality project. Yet something fundamentally dishonest keeps it this side of brilliance and ironically the dishonesty is a direct consequence of its telling a true story about real living people. As presented here Micky Ward is a battling bruiser in the ring though in his daily life hes passive and at the mercy of his mother (Melissa Leo) who manages him and his brother Dicky (Christian Bale) who trains him. Both are pretty much useless. His mother doesnt have the business acumen to get him anywhere near the big time and Dicky is a crack addict and consequently unreliable to say the least. His mother and brother are sponges living off Mickys pain and labor and whats worse theyre a united front. This is emphasized in Bale and Leos performances which were clearly worked out in concert to ape each others facial expressions. Theyre a club of two. Thus as much as they profess to be in Mickys corner theyre most loyal to each other. Related Stories The Fighter Mom and Dicky are the true antagonists in opposition to our hero not any boxer Micky might face in the ring. So its appropriate that Leo and Bale should transform into outsized monsters completely unlike their usual screen selves. Leo loses her aura of earnestness and reserve and becomes an old sex-bomb harpy in tight pants and low tops a tough talking Mama who prides herself on holding her own in a mans world. And not enough can be said for Bale who lost 30 pounds for this role and looks like a bad day in hell - with a hollowed out face and bad teeth. Hes a fidgety wreck but fancies himself king of the neighborhood. Bale endows him with a confidence that has no justification in reality and that can only come from a lifetime spent as mothers favorite. His performance is shrewdly observed physically precise and psychologically acute. Its beautiful work. ""The Fighter"" emerges then as a movie about the nightmare of family how sometimes its necessary to get away from ones relations in order to become an adult. In addition to Dicky Micky has a swarm of sisters all violent and stupid and presented by director David O. Russell as a comic chorus. In the whole film only one person has Mickys back and thats his girlfriend Charlene played by Amy Adams as just as hardboiled as Mickys family. Shes lots of fun though the role doesnt really give her a chance to play more than one note. Wahlberg with his average-guy introspection and no-fuss consideration of other people creates a character we cant help care about and the question the audience has throughout is ""Will he ever become a man and assert himself?"" The question is not ""Will he become a champ?"" because thats secondary. Its his manhood not his standing in the world of boxing thats on the line. Either hell become an autonomous adult or hell give into his familys dysfunction. Or perhaps something will happen in between. In any case theres only one path here to a happy ending. This is precisely where the movie becomes dishonest. The screenplay obviously had to adhere to the basic facts - thats a precondition of telling a story from real life. But how the movie interprets those facts - as success or failure victory or defeat triumph or embarrassment - is the choice of the writers. Ultimately ""The Fighter"" loses its courage and betrays the terms of its own story by fashioning an interpretation designed to please the people it portrays. It does a switch on us by changing its focus from Mickys character to Mickys career and then pretending it was really about the career all along. Most people wont notice this and will walk out thinking ""What a terrific picture."" But if you do see the switch youll see nothing else and it will mar your memory of an otherwise strong film. -- Advisory This film contains drug use nudity strong language and sexual situations.

"A boxing film with reality in its corner - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs A boxing film with reality in its cornerThe Fighter a 3 1/2 starsDecember 16 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticMark Wahlberg stars as a former boxing champ.Six years ago Clint Eastwoods ""Million Dollar Baby"" showed up late in the release calendar and walloped enough fans of boxing melodrama cliches to send it straight to the Academy Awards. Now comes ""The Fighter"" an off-center but exceptional boxing film I prefer in every aspect especially one It feels like it comes from real life as well as the movies. Set and shot mostly in Lowell Mass. with a wonderful eye for atmosphere this one took a long time to get made. Originally it was to be filmed by ""Black Swan"" director Darren Aronofsky. David O. Russell whose stimulating resume (""Flirting With Disaster"" ""Three Kings"") reveals a much wider stylistic range than Aronofskys took over. Excellent choice. As written this true story of welterweight Micky Ward and his trainer-brother Dicky Eklund careens from addiction themes to brotherly love and familial crises to the sort of comedy the boxing genre typically resists. The comedy feels natural and right because ""The Fighter"" concerns itself more with Wards squalling family than with what goes on in the ring. Dicky played as a chemically addled whirligig by Christian Bale was once the ""pride of Lowell"" having knocked down (or did he slip?) Sugar Ray Leonard. Lately Dicky has been relegated to the role of trainer; his half-brother Micky played by Mark Wahlberg is the familys new hope for boxing glory. Alice the siblings formidable chain-smoking mother also has seven -- count em seven -- big-haired daughters who run as a heavily aerosoled pack. The fabulous Melissa Leo has a ball as Alice Mickys manager whose ruling credo when it comes to outsiders is simple. Do not trust them if theyre not related. The latest in a series of run-ins with the local police lands Dicky in jail and while the title ""The Fighter"" is singular it refers to just about everybody on screen. Dickys recovery both in terms of his addiction and self-worth runs parallel to Mickys rise in the ring once he has (temporarily) left the bosom of his family. The film does not deal with Wards career highlight the bouts against Arturo Gatti; rather Russell and company keep the focus where it belongs. As Mickys lover Charlene Amy Adams delivers the sort of honesty and hard-shell truth we too rarely see with depictions of working-class characters in American movies. Jack McGee as Mickys bulldog of a father couldnt be better. Real-life Lowell cop and boxing trainer Mickey OKeefe plays himself. These are all faces to remember. Three-quarters of ""The Fighter"" is terrific and plays exactly like the film Russell wanted to make. The final quarter is more like the film he felt he had to deliver to get by with the rest. The climactic fight doesnt quite come off (its filmed indifferently with a series of conventional fade-outs and dissolves). And as impressive as Bales performance is youre made aware of the actor acting mightily as opposed to inhabiting a flamboyantly combustible character with ease. Small matters in a rich experience. Its one of the years best and I liked it even better the second time. mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating R (for language throughout drug content some violence and sexuality) Cast Mark Wahlberg (Micky Ward); Christian Bale (Dicky Eklund); Amy Adams (Charlene); Melissa Leo (Alice); Jack McGee (George Ward); Mickey OKeefe (as himself) Credits Directed by David O.

Sure its based on the story of ""Irish"" Micky Ward a slugging welterweight played here with mumbling sincerity by Mark Wahlberg. But the ring action is just a vessel for the real combat between a frustrated young man and the family that pins him in a corner and wont let up. If Rocky is the rah-rah fight film of record and Raging Bull applies tragic dimensions to a palookas downward spiral then The Fighter arrives somewhere in between these two opposites. Director David O. Russell borrows from each but most of his stylistic choices from darting camerawork and long tracking shots to spontaneous blood thirst and pop songs that hit the perfect emotional cues pay homage to Raging Bull director Martin Scorsese. No sin there Russell has studied the master better than most and hes come up with a compulsively watchable picture.Russell doesnt just play with the boxing movie; he flips its form and cliches into a central plot element. An HBO documentary crew is following Mickys brother and trainer Dicky Ecklund (played by a shifty strutting Christian Bale). Dicky chronically irresponsible and self-destructive thinks the filmmakers want to chronicle his comeback attempt. Theyre really interested in his crack addiction depicted unflinchingly in the run-down houses of the boys blue-collar Lowell Mass. Dicky is ready for his close-up but headed for the gutter and it looks as if hell drag his brothers career down with him.The Fighter thrives on its thorny family dynamics. In one corner Micky and his new girlfriend a spunky sexy barmaid played by Amy Adams who urges him to flee his motley clan. In the other Dicky; their suffocating mother (Melissa Leo with platinum-blond hair and the fury of a perpetually wounded matriarch); and their seven sisters a rough woolly tribe that doesnt cotton to outsiders. Russell shoots the sisters tightly in the frame and creates the sensation that were looking at a single organism thats always ready to spring and squabble. A right cross is all well and good but its the ladies you dont want to mess with here. And the men know it.Loyalty or success? The ties that bind or the taste of freedom? These are age-old conflicts and The Fighter has some of the old-fashioned qualities and big emotion that define so many vintage fight yarns. The movie triumphs by making the standard moves feel modern by adding some grit to the family melodrama and carving out a sense of media savvy. Russell proves deft at interpolating 80s boxing footage and audio including the now-outdated production value of young cable television with the manufactured drama. It doesnt hurt that the boxing sequences are superbly staged The nimble camerawork opens up the ring and the exaggerated combat common to the genre is kept to a minimum without minimizing the impact of the hardest blows.If some of the characters and conflicts feel stock the familiarity doesnt stand in The Fighters way. This is polished entertainment with a little edge a juicy urban fable for grown-ups.Directed by David O.

"The Fighter Stellar cast and great story make for one-two punch | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Fighter Stellar cast and great story make for one-two punchThe Fighter engages the mind and also the body by proxy. You may not physically experience the punches that rain upon Mark Wahlbergs dogged boxer but it feels that way.Christian Bale left and Mark Wahlberg star ine The Fighter.  (JOJO WHILDEN / AP)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Dec. 16 2010 The Fighter (out of 4) Starring Mark Wahlberg Christian Bale Amy Adams and Melissa Leo. Directed by David O. Russell. At major theatres. 115 minutes. 14A Head body head Cmon These are instructions shouted in The Fighter but theyre also descriptions of the impact of this spirited and tactile film which boasts the years best ensemble cast. It engages the mind and also the body by proxy. You may not physically experience the punches that rain upon Mark Wahlbergs dogged pro boxer ""Irish"" Micky Ward but it feels as if you do. Micky isnt the only scrapper implied by that singularly misleading title. Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale) Mickys half-brother and full-on coach friend and millstone once had a ring career too. He went the distance against Sugar Ray Leonard in a controversial 1978 fight and hes never let anyone forget it. Dicky was the Pride of Lowell Mass. the tough mill town where another free spirit beat scribe Jack Kerouac also hailed from. Now its 1993 and Dicky is struggling to rebound from alcohol and crack abuse. Its Mickys turn to be the Pride of Lowell by winning welterweight championship honors and the two bros. couldnt be more different. Micky is taciturn stolid determined. Dicky is mouthy restless and to use his own words ""squirrelly as f--k."" But Dicky knows how to fight and how to motivate. Its he who shouts those instructions above. Its his not-so-secret formula for success for guys who must get things done the hard way. Head body head Cmon Lowell is a hard-knocks town for women too. Micky and Dicky have seven sisters who sit on the family couch like magpies on a steeple. They smoke and cuss and judge but theyre fiercely loyal to family. They dont like Mickys new girlfriend barmaid Charlene (Amy Adams). Says one disapproving sis ""Shes like one of those MTV girls Wild"" Then theres mom Alice (Melissa Leo) done up like a hooker at a wedding in her tight pant suit ensemble. Shes Mickys business manager but shes as useful as a horsefly getting him into fights that are bad both for his ego and his body. Is she mothering Micky or just using him? Whatever the answer Micky needs to fight his way off the familys ropes if he ever hopes to succeed in the ring. He has to work ""haaad"" -- thats the local way of saying ""hard."" Of this rough mix does director David O. Russell fashion an engrossing picture one more concerned with family brawls than ringside ones. Russells last movie with Wahlberg was I Heart Huckabees an existential mess from six years ago that didnt make it past the first round down in the multiplex arena. Russell has something to prove here too. He returns to the more muscular storytelling style of Three Kings his 1999 feature also co-starring Wahlberg that viewed the first Persian Gulf War through cynical eyes. The Fighter has been described as a labour of love for Wahlberg who grew up in nearby Boston hearing about the true exploits of Lowells Micky and Dicky who make brief curtain-call appearances. Usually when ""labour of love"" appears as a descriptor earnest and timid results are guaranteed. Not so here. Wahlberg is incredibly generous letting others shine around his deliberately understated performance. And they do exactly that especially Bale who runs away with one of the most memorable performances of 2010. He dropped weight thinned his hair and bucked-up his teeth for his crackerjack performance as Dicky. Hes at once shocking infuriating pitiful prideful and hilarious. Caught by Alice sneaking out of a crack house -- he jumped out a back window -- he gets her smile back by making her join in on his warble of the Bee Gees ""I Started A Joke."" Bale Adams and Leo have all just received Screen Actors Guild Award nominations while Wahlberg joins them in an additional nod for Outstanding Cast Performance. Watch for Oscar nominations to come amongst other seasonal kudos. The Fighter is a movie that just goes for it and that includes director Russell. He closes in tight on anxious and pummeled faces. His camera is also ""squirrelly as f--k"" but hes keeping up with the action both inside and outside the ring. Hes fighting too he has to convince people that The Fighter isnt just a boxing movie. Its 12 rounds of hard living but you cant knock the pride out of someone who believes in himself.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""The Fighter"" is a great gutsy boxing story a knowingly detailed compelling often very funny look inside the lives of underdogs battling for respect. The films title could apply to every significant character onscreen. The films structure is evasive but it hangs together nicely. The rambling opening scenes in which the characters mug and strut for an HBO documentary crew visiting their hometown are important in setting up what follows. Mark Wahlberg plays real-life fighter ""Irish"" Micky Ward a 30-year-old contender from blue-collar Lowell Mass. Hes a modest guy a road paver with a busted marriage but in the ring hes the rock of Gibraltar. Rough around the edges full of potential and consistently flashing hints of greatness. Micky looks like he could follow in the footsteps of his older half-brother retired pro Dicky Eklund who once went the distance against Sugar Ray Leonard. Some footsteps. Dicky who works on the same road crew as Micky swaggers down the sidewalk receiving greetings and salutations from the townies like royalty. Hes affectionately called ""the pride of Lowell"" but in truth hes a punch-drunk idiot savant. Dicky is a loose cannon a crackhead oblivious to the destructive choices he makes. You can see why hed thrive in the controlled chaos of boxing. In the real world he hasnt a clue. Micky and Dicky are polar opposites. Dicky loves his little brother but envies him nurtures him with savvy coaching advice while undermining him with erratic unreliable behavior. The reluctant mentor-irrepressible pupil story has been done a million times before in sports movies. This one sets the formula on its head. In the role of Dicky Christian Bale proves he is one of the most talented and interesting actors of his generation. Gaunt-cheeked wild-eyed and sizzling with unfocused energy he makes Dicky an unforgettable goofus-hustler. And that is no small accomplishment in a film swirling with so many vivid characters so much life and complication. ""The Fighter"" is like a big unruly party a harmonious cacophony of overlapping voices and competing agendas. The ensemble scenes with Melissa Leo as the brothers hard-shellacked ma Alice and her brood of a half-dozen smart-mouthed daughters leave you feeling alternately exhilarated baffled and overwhelmed. Alice a domineering alpha-cougar slings plates at her current husband when shes peeved. You can see why Micky and Dicky felt at home in the ring; they learned to duck early. As he battles his way up the ranks soft-spoken Micky acquires a girlfriend and champion in Charlene (Amy Adams proving that she can play a brassy barmaid as well as a Disney princess). In Charlenes first uproarious encounter with the family the women size her up with withering sneers and call her ""an MTV girl"" -- a wild thing who thinks shes better than they are. His new relationship forces Micky to recognize that he may have to fight his way free of his smothering demanding clan if hes to succeed. But cut off from that taproot of family loyalty does he have a shot? If you have seen many boxing pictures or know Micky Wards real-life story you know the answer but the film keeps you gripping the armrests until the final punch is thrown. Director David O. Russell (""Three Kings"") has created a casual masterpiece an irresistibly enjoyable film that makes everything else in theaters feel like yesterdays news. Its one of the greatest movie experiences of the year.

Brute force and finesse in the ring - angst and melodrama ambition and heartbreak outside.David O. Russells The Fighter based on the story of real-life welterweight champ ""Irish"" Micky Ward and his wacko half-brother erstwhile prizefighter Dicky Eklund can now be added to the ranks. A storm-tossed tale of family - a feisty domineering mother; a weak father figure; a chorus of gum-smacking catcalling sisters - and the pursuit of a dream The Fighter is funny ferocious sad sweet pulpy and violent. Sometimes all in the same minute.Its rich business and it gives Mark Wahlberg (as Micky) Christian Bale (as Dicky) Melissa Leo (in big hair as their mother Alice) and Amy Adams (Charlene Mickys barkeep girlfriend) the chance to dive deep into a colorful hardscrabble world. Working on a road-paving crew in hometown Lowell Mass. one day riding a limo to an Atlantic City arena the next.Russell has a knack for the nutty. Three Kings (also with Wahlberg) was an anarchic war-zone heist pic Flirting With Disaster a loopy screwball saga I Huckabees a weird existential romp. And while there are laughs here (lots - but I love Adams Charlene wisecracking on Mickys choice of a date-night movie a subtitled Luis BuA+-uel pic) the director proves impressively adept at staging and shooting the fights. With a tip of the gloves to Scorsese and Raging Bull Russell delivers the punches in a series of brutal bouts.Ward in his epic stands against the likes of Alfonso Sanchez and Arturo Gatti withstood pummeling upon pummeling - it was Dickys strategy to have his brother wear opponents down by letting them beat him up for a half-dozen rounds and then come back and deal the mighty blow.Russell and his cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema (the Swedish teen vampire romance Let the Right One In) record the thunderous punches and rib-crunching clashes with an authenticity thats visceral jolting. This is the kind of role that Wahlberg excels at - stoic sturdy focused - and hes formidable. You feel for the guy.And Bale as Dicky whose glory days are gone and whos now battling with addiction issues gives another of his scary-real performances. Hopped up sunken-eyed and scrawny Dicky is a wreck and hes wrecking his brothers career. (Dicky is the crackhead ghost of Terry Malloy - he coulda been a contender.) Bloodlines and bad blood bonds and betrayal - its all here. The family conflicts are as messy and intense as the slugfests in the ring.The mugs on the actors orbiting Wahlberg Bale Adams and Leo - the women Russell lined up to play the sisters the guys in the gym the crack-den denizens - are chiseled and crooked and about as unglamorous as Hollywood gets. Diane Arbus could have been the casting director. The Fighter is pug-ugly and proud.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Comments (3) click to enlarge The Fighter Recommended Rated R  115 minutes  2010 In this old-school fight picture from David O. Russell Mark Wahlberg realizes his long-held dream of playing ""Irish"" Micky Ward a working-class lug from Lowell Massachusetts whose promising career as a welterweight boxer in the early 90s was hampered by his domineering mother (Melissa Leo) and crack-addicted half-brother (Christian Bale). Its an unusual project for Russell director of such satirical dramas as Three Kings and I Heart Huckabees but he easily locates the storys abrading edge in Wards close-knit little neighborhood the family and friends cheering him on are the same people selfishly holding him back. Bale dominates the movie as Dicky Eklund a pathetic loudmouth whos let his own fight career slip away from him yet what really holds this together is Wahlbergs low-key firmly internalized performance as a man torn between his loyalty to the clan and his responsibility to himself.

The Fighter Good to great Director David O. Russell. Cast Mark Wahlberg Christian Bale Melissa Leo. Rating Rated R for language throughout drug content some violence and sexuality. Guide to this weeks new movie releases Spotlight Mark Wahlberg | Christian Bale Off with their shirts Hunky actors Qamp;A with Christian Bale Russell Wahlberg learn together on The Fighter >> Guide to this weeks new movie releases | Qamp;A Christian Bale David O. Russells film makes use of some terrific performances - Christian Bale is brilliant as is Melissa Leo even by their lofty standards - to tell the story of ""Irish"" Micky Ward a real-life fighter of the scrappy variety; he could take a punch and another and another until his opponent tired out and he moved in for the kill. Of course he could take a punch. The selfish stupid petty jealousies inflicted upon him by his family must have made getting socked in the gut seem like a vacation in comparison. ""The Fighter"" is not immune to the feel-good fairytale trappings found in most boxing movies. We root for the hero to win naturally and if you follow boxing you know how the story ends. What makes Russells film different is what happens along the way Wards quiet unassuming acceptance of his lot in life - the son of an ambitious power-mad mother almost like something out of Shakespeare; a crackhead brother who was supposed to be the familys shot at boxing fame; and a chorus of harpy sisters whose hair is bigger than their intellect. Micky is buoyed by the love of a good woman naturally who helps him move beyond the limitations that his family however misguidedly well-meaning its members might be imposes upon him. The film opens not with Micky (Mark Wahlberg) but with his half brother Dicky (Bale) talking into cameras filming a documentary for HBO. Rail-thin jittery unable to focus Dicky is clearly off somehow. Its fitting that the cameras follow him; a former fighter himself he once knocked Sugar Ray Leonard down during a fight (though some maintain Leonard tripped) and has basked in that fading glory ever since. He will not cede the spotlight easily. Now hes training Micky who works on a street-repair crew in their neighborhood in Lowell Mass. when hes not fighting. Dicky is notoriously unreliable constantly retreating to a broken-down crackhouse for another hit when hes supposed to be in the gym with Micky. But their mother Alice (Leo) is endlessly forgiving of Dicky - and forever critical of Micky whom she treats more as meal ticket than son. She is a force of nature terrifying in her fury. While Micky is preparing for a fight he starts dating Charlene (Amy Adams) a bartender and college dropout which qualifies her as haughty and arrogant in Mickys familys eyes. His opponent falls ill just before the fight and is replaced by a fighter who outweighs Micky by 20 pounds. Its a ridiculous mismatch but Dicky and Alice insist Micky should go through with the fight and its attendant payday. He gets the money but is pummeled for his troubles. This is enough for Charlene to try to convince Micky that his family is holding him back even harming him. But these ties run deep and are difficult to sever. Charlene is tougher than Mickys family and even Micky realizes however. Dicky will also manage to take himself out of the equation for a while allowing Micky to grow out of his shadow. Again however blood is thick. Bale is simply great as Dicky - gaunt twitchy unhinged deluded. Leo is nearly his equal as the scheming Alice. Adams breaks out of the pretty-little-princess mold in which shes been cast with a powerful performance. And Wahlberg quietly anchors the action his Micky a steady presence whose calm keeps an unruly bunch in line - for the most part. ""The Fighter"" easily could have slipped into boxing-film cliches but Russell doesnt let that happen. Instead it lands its hardest blows while chronicling the struggle of a family which is a far more interesting fight. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

By David Edelstein Published Dec 12 2010 ShareThis Bale and Wahlberg in The Fighter.  (Photo Jojo Whilden/Courtesy of Paramount Pictures) Good news The Fighter is mistitled. Its not about another raging bull. Its about a whole raging family bulls cows even raging heifers. It opens in 1993 in the blue-collar section of Lowell Massachusetts where the punching doesnt stop at the ropes and the air is alive with epithets Ya junkbag ya skank ya cheap bastahd. At last the famously pugilistic filmmaker David O. Russell (George Clooney in a Playboy interview He turned on me and said You want to hit me? You want to hit me? Come on pussy hit me. Im looking at him like hes out of his mind. Then he started banging me on the head with his head) has found a set of characters more quarrelsome than he is two half-brothers Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) and Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale); Mickys bartending squeeze Charlene (Amy Adams); their boozy bottle-blonde mom Alice (Melissa Leo); and their fearsome armada of big-haired sisters. Ironically the title character Wahlbergs Micky is the movies peacemaker. He just wants everyone to get along so he can pummel people outside the family to a pulp. The Fighter takes a while to find its footing. It opens in a faux-documentary style with the emphasis on faux Once again Massachusetts accents prove to be the kryptonite of superstars. (Even Wahlberg cant nail the tricky Lowell dialect.) Bales Dicky once a boxer and the pride of Lowell is now the subject of an HBO whatever-happened-to doc he thinks is meant to herald his comeback. But its actually about how he became a crackheadwhich is bad for Dicky but good for Bale who gets a chance to do one of those overcommitted-Method-actor transformations which leaves him with bones popping out of his sallow flesh. Hes terrific but you know ick. Its the faded junior welterweight Micky now working in construction who decides to give the ring one more shot and who ends up getting the boost from HBO. In this he is assistedand prodded and sometimes browbeatenby his new girlfriend. It falls to Charlene to pry Micky loose from his druggie brother and loudmouthed mom and Amy Adamsin the past such an airy-fairy and ethereal little nunhas accomplished her own transformation. She has gained weight not much but enough to give her a cute tum and make her arms look like theyre used to heaving multiple pitchers of lager. And with her eyes like blue steel and swarm of red hair it doesnt take much to get her Irish up. The Fighter really takes off when her Charlene goes up against Mama Alice who calls her mystifyingly an MTV girl but is finally forced to respect her titanic will. You get the feeling that Leo a full-throttle scenery chewer was forced to respect Adams too Its mano-a-mano in that nutty Best Supporting Actress category. Director Russell reportedly signed on late in the game when Darren Aronofsky dropped out to punish ballerinas instead of boxers and his filmmaking is loose and spontaneous. The themes dont snap into focusId have liked a nod to the irony that HBO sells Dickys downfall as avidly as Mickys risebut the movie has so much texture that once it gets you youre good and got. The real Micky Ward was known for taking loads of punishment and the fighting is brutal. But Russell doesnt stylize the bouts or go for Raging Bullstyle slo-mo crucifixion poetry. Youre always aware of the people outside the ropes screaming at Micky who seems to feed on all that family drama to suck it in the way Popeye sucked in spinach. The Fighter suggests that a seedy nasty milieu can knock you down but also pick you up and shove you back in the ring to keep punching. Its a rousing picture. What moved Joel and Ethan Coen to adapt Charles Portiss 1968 novel True Grit for the screen anew 40-plus years after John Wayne made the one-eyed Marshall Rooster Cogburn his own? My guess is that they were turned on by Portiss voice his mixture of quasi-biblical dialect and morbidly funny modern fatalism. The novel is structured like an old-fashioned revenge saga except the villain is a hapless cretin and the hero a mean drunk who rode with the Confederate Captain Quantrill during the infamous Lawrence Kansas massacre of 1863. Director Henry Hathaway was too old-school to underline the sick jokes and Wayne had a mythical persona to uphold. The Coens signal their intentions by replacing the Duke with the Dude (Jeff Bridges) and introducing himor rather his voicefrom inside an outhouse. Behind the walls he sits churlishly refusing to engage with Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) a 14-year-old who seeks a man with true grit to help her capture her fathers killer. At that point all we can tell is that Cogburn has true shit. Next Why True Grit isnt as momentous an event as you might hope. 1 2 3 Next Share this story...

"The Fighter review Cast shines in tale of underdog pugilist Micky Ward |       NJ.com comments The Fighter review Cast shines in tale of underdog pugilist Micky Ward Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on December 10 2010 at 804 AM View/Post Comments JOJO WHILDEN Mark Wahlberg right as Micky Ward in ""The Fighter"" with Christian Bale. Long before he ever put on a pair of boxing gloves Micky Ward was standing up and taking blows. Those fights -- not always physical -- came in his home and in his hometown of Lowell Mass. where he grew up in a huge fractious family in the shadow of his bigger more reckless brother. Until finally Micky fought back -- and then started standing up for himself in the ring as well. Thats the story of ""The Fighter"" a terrifically acted drama with Mark Wahlberg Christian Bale Amy Adams and Melissa Leo. Yet while the actors are mostly fine the setup poses problems for filmmaker David O. Russell. The chief problem is Micky Ward himself. As portrayed in the film hes a passive figure dominated by a pushy family that is steering his career straight toward Palookaville -- while Micky sits back looking only slightly put out. Movie Review The Fighter (R) Paramount (101 min.)Directed by David O. Russell. With Mark Wahlberg Christian Bale Amy Adams Melissa Leo. Now playing in New York; scheduled to open in New Jersey Dec. 17. Rating note The film contains violence drug abuse sexual situations and strong language. Stephen Whittys Review TWO STARS Its hard to root for someone like that. And although Micky eventually breaks free of these loving bullies its only because he falls for a pretty bartender whos just as I-know-whats-good-for-ya as his ma. Here comes the new boss cuter than the old boss. True by the end of the film Micky has stood up for himself a bit. But hes still too submissive to hang a drama on. And if there is a larger point -- was Wards slow boxing style patiently accepting punishment one his whole life prepared him for? -- its not one Russell makes. So in the end its left to the actors to try to take this movie the whole 12 rounds. They mostly do. Actually although Bale has been drawing the most attention his work as Mickys brother Dickie -- a clowning crack addict -- seems the most obvious a flashy collection of faces. Exaggerated and eccentric its the kind of job only an Oscar voter could love. Subtler though is the tough and trashy work from Amy Adams as Mickys girl an iron fist in a fishnet glove. And after ""Conviction"" and ""Welcome to the Rileys"" Melissa Leo turns in her third great performance this year as the brothers rusty battle-ax of a mother. JOJO WHILDEN Amy Adams plays Charlene Fleming and Mark Wahlberg plays Micky Ward. Of course its Mark Wahlberg whos the star and who pushed this project into production. Hes rock-solid in the ring and truly affecting in the films quieter moments -- as he sits tongue-tied on a couch while his older sisters and new girlfriend sling insults over his head. But is this the real Micky Ward? Hard to say. The script eliminates material both embarrassing (like Dickies slide back into legal troubles) and essential (Wards three astonishing battles with Arturo Gatti). Thats likely to leave some fight fans disappointed. Fans of solid acting and stylish directing are likely to be happier. The performers land some good jabs. And Russells fancy footwork -- giving the fight scenes the look of cheap old video and cranking up some power rock on the soundtrack -- is impressive. But that one dramatic knockout punch? It never really comes. As a film ""The Fighter"" is a sturdy solid slugger -- but not quite a champ.

(Everett) Joe Neumaier Friday December 10 2010 400 AM Title The Fighter Fact-based drama about an amateur boxer and his crack-addicted older brother. With Mark Wahlberg Christian Bale Amy Adams. Director David O. Russell (154). R Violence drug use sexuality. At Lincoln Square 12.The way Christian Bale moves in ""The Fighter"" is something to watch. As a former contender who blew his shot at success thanks to a crack addiction Bale like the movie itself bobs and weaves jumps around goes low and then high and seems to be made out of liquid. You cant get a bead on him but you cant take your eyes away.By far the most rousing expertly cast movie this year David O. Russells movie takes a roundabout way of telling its true story from the early 1990s of 31-year-old amateur welterweight Micky Ward (a terrific Mark Wahlberg) who stays true to his working-class life in Lowell Mass. while aiming for the big time. Mickys older brother Dicky Eklund (Bale) a local hero for momentarily knocking down Sugar Ray Leonard in a bout 15 years earlier is his trainer -- though Dickys drug habit holds them back. Their hard-charging mother Alice (Melissa Leo) however works as their fight manager to get Micky his shot and Dicky a future.Except Dickys planned comeback an HBO documentary he appears in turns out to be about crack in America a fact he doesnt realize until he watches the completed TV special from prison. When hes released hes clean and wants to train his brother again yet Micky and his tough smart bartender girlfriend Charlene (Amy Adams) decide that for Micky to win Dicky has to stay away.Bale and Wahlbergs spot-on back-and-forth fuels ""The Fighter"" but there are other pleasures -- especially Leo who like Bale is a shoo-in Oscar nominee for her gritty often funny performance. (Among other things Alice barks orders to Micky and Dickys seven sisters who move en masse but any one of em could knock your teeth out.) Russells been dormant since the failure ""I Heart Huckabees"" although he also made 1999s ""Three Kings"" and like that off-kilter action-comedy ""The Fighter"" takes you by surprise. Its more than just ""Rocky"" with drug use and family issues -- and it has an underdog ending youll walk away raving about.

Photo Paramount Pictures Pity the boxing movie that thinks it can be both ""Raging Bull"" and ""Rocky."" ""The Fighter"" (did you stay up all night working on that title fellas?) is the real-life welterweight Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) a product of disintegrating Lowell Mass. Hes the younger half-brother of the washed-up and drugged-out Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale) a boxer himself who in the 1980s once floored Sugar Ray Leonard. Or maybe Sugar Ray tripped. Now its the mid-1990s and Mickys career is being held back by the bad advice of Dicky a roosterish crackhead and his manager mother Alice (Melissa Leo) a cawing shrew. Bale and Leo turn the movie into a white-trash Dumpster dive for lowlife looky-loos full of scorn and mockery for these types but innocent of any subtlety or attempt to understand. Every few scenes a horrific half-dozen of Mickys freak-show sisters -- all deep-fried hair and deep-cut leopard-print tops -- sit shrieking in a row but they serve no dramatic purpose. Theyre simply the worst kind of running gag planted to excite our sense of superiority like prize exhibits from the skank museum. Leo and Bale give the kind of unbearably emphatic all-caps performances that are guaranteed to get Oscar nominations for best supporting caricatures. Any actor who played Bonnie Parker or Joseph Stalin with the kind of chomping frenzy Bale and Leo bring to every scene would be advised to tone things down a bit but Hollywood is blind to hyperbole when it comes to the lunch-bucket class. Bale even has a funny way of running -- Ace Ventura meets Forrest Gump. Oh and he has whittled his frame down to that of a cancerous scarecrow. By all means give him an Oscar Obviously weight manipulation and artistry are the same thing. Its worth noting that no such histrionics are on offer from Wahlberg who unlike Leo Bale and their director and unindicted co-conspirator David O. Russell (""Three Kings"" ""Flirting With Disaster"") actually knows something about Boston-area blue collars. He turns in an honest and clearheaded performance as Bale capers and mugs juking and jiving and diving out of windows. Wahlbergs character feels like an actual person and to the extent the movie sticks with him its reasonably effective. A bruised but restrained Amy Adams is believable as the girl a tough little barmaid who encourages Micky to shed the influence of his mom and brother though in the latter case Micky is aided by Dickys being jailed. Without this mini-crusade her character wouldnt have much to do but as it is she underlines the curious passivity of the central figure (tough guy cant win a battle with his ma? Wasnt this filmed before as ""Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot""?). Equally equivocal is the story which cant quite figure out what or whom its about. At one point the movie wastes 10 minutes or so working out that Dicky accepts being fired as a coach. Then he goes right back to being Mickys workout partner and even ringside helper during the big fight. If Dicky is fine when hes off drugs then the movie isnt really even about feuding brothers. It simply tells us crack isnt a great lifestyle choice. For 10 minutes in the middle and 20 minutes at the end the movie turns into a ""Rocky"" clone with apologetically brief workout scenes that are a little too embarrassed by their conventionality to be rousing and fight scenes shot exactly like the Italian Stallions. But if these parts and Wahlbergs restraint do squeeze out some emotion they still dont cohere in a movie thats mainly about its junkyard mise-en-scene. And what a miserable mise it is Two-thirds of ""The Fighter"" is a slog through the bleak and the ugly -- poverty porn meant to reassure us that our social inferiors never say anything witty or achieve a moment of grace.

"Go see David O. Russells The Fighter. Slate Sign In Sign Up Go see David O. Russells The Fighter. Go see David O. Russells The Fighter. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 9 2010 608 PM Barnburner David O. Russells The Fighter is intense and emotionally rich. By Dana Stevens Christian Bale (left) and Mark Wahlberg in The Fighter David O. Russell loves a good melee. Whether in the mode of road-trip farce (Flirting With Disaster) Gulf War satire (Three Kings) or a difficult-to-classify new genre that might at a stretch be called existential romantic comedy (I Heart Huckabees) Russell makes movies that mix it up. He favors large casts multiple story lines dialogue that flies loose and fast and broad sight gags that suddenly give way to philosophical exchanges of almost comical bleakness. His films unfold in an atmosphere of barely controlled chaos. Whats more the director himself is a notoriously volatile presence Witness the much-circulated clip of him in a screaming match with Lily Tomlin on the I Heart Huckabees set. Russells decision to make a boxing biopic--based on the true story of the underdog welterweight champion Micky Ward--seemed at first like a waste of his offbeat talent. But as it turns out The Fighter (Paramount Pictures) is a perfect fit for Russells style. Really its less a sports movie than a family drama and the family in question--the Ward/Eklund clan of Lowell Mass. a working-class suburb of Boston--is unhinged enough to do way more than just flirt with disaster. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. From the start The Fighter exudes a vibe thats decidedly un-Rocky. Two half-brothers Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) and Dickie Eklund (Christian Bale) walk down the streets of Lowell Micky contained and shy Dickie loose-limbed and wildly expressive greeting everyone in sight clearly the de facto mayor of the town. As the camera pulls back we see that the brothers arent simply strolling but performing. An HBO crew is following them through town making a movie. Dickie a former boxing champ whose claim to fame is that he once went the distance against Sugar Ray Leonard  brags that its a documentary about his imminent comeback but it soon becomes clear that HBO is more interested in Dickies current life situation Hes a crack addict who periodically disappears for days at a time. Advertisement Meanwhile younger brother Micky pursues his own less illustrious boxing career. Hes being trained by Dickie whose work ethic is seriously compromised by his drug addiction and managed by their mother the beehive-sporting chain-smoking Alice (Melissa Leo.) Though shes fiercely devoted to both of her sons and all seven () of her grown daughters Alice has some conflicts of interest as a manager The family is so badly in need of money that she pushes Micky into fights hes not ready for or for which hes dramatically outmatched. When hes badly injured in one such fight Mickys new girlfriend Charlene (Amy Adams) encourages him to seek new management. This doesnt go a long way toward endearing Charlene to Alice and her seven scowling daughters.  This movies title presumably describes Micky Ward but actually it applies to all of the characters. These people are fighters--not just in the sense that theyre unshakably dedicated to a cause but in the sense that theyre always ready to tear one anothers heads off. Micky and Dickie exchange blows both inside and outside the ring. Alice wings crockery--including iron pots that could do some real damage--at her husband the preternaturally patient George Ward (Jack McGee). And in one memorable scene Charlene leaps into the fray with all seven sisters when they come to her front porch to bawl her out. This gang gives the Whites of West Virginia a run for their money. The boxing scenes are filmed as they would have appeared on pay-per-view in the early 90s--grainy video vintage logos and all. With the exception of the last big fight these scenes are relatively short and not hyper-violent which will come as a relief to viewers still rattled (30  years later) by the close-up slo-mo shots of head trauma in Raging Bull. The real violence happens not in the ring but in the domestic arena. This family unit isnt cutely ""dysfunctional"" in the sitcom style; its genuinely disturbed--yet genuinely loving at the same time. When Micky nervously stands up to his domineering thin-skinned mother you root for him to cut the apron strings but you also understand Alices sense of betrayal. Russell has always excelled at finding new ways to use familiar actors and every performance in The Fighter is noteworthy if not outstanding. Weve gotten so used to watching Christian Bale glower stoically behind a bat-mask we forget how good he is when hes deranged glassy-eyed and bouncing off walls--like a less malign version of American Psychos Patrick Bateman. And this is Melissa Leo as youve never seen her before; usually cast as a wise earth mother shes a sight to behold stomping around in heels and leopard-print pantsuits. As the lovers eager to escape this toxic matriarch Mark Wahlberg and Amy Adams have less attention-getting parts but theyre both superb Wahlberg in a role thats more tender and more diffident than the ones he usually plays Adams in one thats uncharacteristically vulgar and street-smart. Advertisement If youre still not convinced that you should see yet another uplifting sports film let me try one more angle The Fighter is worth seeing less for its well-told inspirational story than for what you might call its emotional texture. Its a rough-edged and proudly unpolished movie with a wealth of odd funny details. One example When a weeping Alice comes to fetch Dickie at the seedy crack house he frequents he suddenly begins to serenade his mother with an a cappella version of the Bee Gees ""I Started a Joke."" The song goes on for a few beats longer than it would in most mainstream movies (not that a normal movie would ever try to orchestrate a tender moment with such a bizarre song). We never learn just what this song means to the two of them why he chooses to sing it at that moment or why she eventually stops crying to sing along. But we dont need to understand the moment fully in order to revel in it Its unforeseeable unexplainable and marvelous like Mickys boxing comeback like life. Correction Dec. 9 2010 This article originally stated that Eklund defeated Sugar Ray Leonard. In fact though he lasted the entire fight without getting knocked out he ultimately lost. (Return to the corrected sentence.) Correction Dec. 10 2010 This article originally spelled ""Dickie"" as ""Dicky"" throughout--the publicity materials for the film had ""Dicky"" but the real Eklund went by ""Dickie."" Finally the film Raging Bull came out 30 years ago not 20 years ago. (Return to the corrected sentence.) Correction Jan. 28 2011 This sentence originally and incorrectly stated that Alices daughters were played by the real-life Eklund/Ward sisters. (Return to the corrected sentence.)

"Movie review The Fighter - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-BoxingMovie review The FighterDavid O. Russells film about a dysfunctional family based on boxer Mickey Wards life is blessed by a superb cast.December 10 2010|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Movie Critic Just like its subject one-time junior welterweight champion ""Irish"" Mickey Ward the rousing ""The Fighter"" tries a number of risky maneuvers and manages to make them pay off in the end. The movie initially feels like more of a near thing than the filmmakers anticipated but as in boxing its only the final decision that counts. Telling Wards story which showcases the kind of personal and professional chaos no boxing movie can exist without has long been a near-obsession for star Mark Wahlberg whose rock-solid performance is the films irreplaceable anchor. The actor has been a fan of Ward since he was a lad growing up in the Boston area and the fighter was living in nearby Lowell and competing so fiercely that Ring Magazine named his bouts the fight of the year three years running. FOR THE RECORD ""The Fighter"" The review of the movie ""The Fighter"" in the Dec. 10 Calendar section misspelled the first name of boxer Micky Ward as Mickey. a Wahlberg was so keen to play Ward that he installed a ring on his property and engaged in early morning boxing training for nearly four years in anticipation of the movie eventually being made. The actor also persuaded his friend David O. Russell who had directed him in ""Three Kings"" and ""I Heart Huckabees"" to make this Scott Silver and Paul Tamasy amp; Eric Johnson script (which inevitably streamlines and simplifies Wards life) his first time behind the camera in six years. Aside from his boxing prowess the heart of Wards story and what makes it worth a film is the involvement of his intense close-knit family especially erratic half-brother Dicky Eklund ( Christian Bale) who helped train him his flinty mother Alice ( Melissa Leo) who managed him and Charlene ( Amy Adams) the attractive young woman he has his eye on. The film introduces Ward in the midst of training for an upcoming fight. Though his beloved older brother is supposed to be in charge of preparations Dicky is much more interested in taking drugs and clowning for an HBO film crew that is following him around for what he thinks will be a film on his comeback. Also not looking out for Wards best interests is his piece-of-work mother and manager Alice. Beautifully played by Leo down to the lacquered blond hair Alice is a self-absorbed queen bee of manipulation a chain-smoking lord of misrule who hovers like a vulture over her sons career. Alice and Dickys golden rule is that if Ward doesnt fight no one gets paid so we watch horrified early in the film as they talk him into a terrible mismatch that gets him battered half to death. Its around this time that Ward meets his soulmate a hot number local bartender named Charlene Fleming who has a deserved reputation as a party girl. Splendidly taken on against type by Adams Charlene is as sane as Mickey and a whole lot tougher psychologically. More than aware that his family members arent doing right by him Charlene campaigns for Mickey to free himself from their grasp and the complications of that endeavor anticipated and otherwise are this films main outside-the-ring agenda. Never a stranger to freewheeling emotion Russell was clearly attached to the excessive natures of this intertwined group. This means that ""The Fighter"" at times portrays the Ward-Eklund clan (which includes father George played by Jack McGee and no fewer than seven sisters) as a species of wild and crazy Bay State Hillbillies. Most excessive of the bunch is half-brother Dicky once a promising fighter but by the early 90s when the film begins a bedraggled character living off the memories of a 1978 fight with Sugar Ray Leonard and so complete and woeful a crack addict he regularly loses track of time and his car. As played by a noticeably thinner Bale (who lost considerable weight for the part but not as much as he did for ""The Machinist"") Dicky still has the gift of gab but hes not quite the charmer he thinks he is. Though the way this clan is portrayed on film is arguably based on reality that doesnt guarantee theyre people you will be eager to spend cinematic time with. ""The Fighter"" runs the risk of being too in love with these questionable folks too willing to indulge their irritating foibles. As it turns out the film is developing strong reasons for doing things this off-putting way but it makes for heavy going in the early days. When compared to his brother Ward is an icon of stability and yet another splendid performance from Wahlberg who stabilizes the picture by bringing his trademark intensely masculine presence to bear as well as his deep knowledge of Ward and his socio-economic background. Wahlberg couldnt be more convincing as perhaps the only sane person in a universe of addicts losers and social misfits. Inside the ring there are always key fights coming up for Ward. When F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote there were no second acts in American lives he certainly didnt have boxing movies and their ever-looming championship bouts in mind. As things start to fall into place ""The Fighters"" inevitable classic finale is especially satisfying because of how long and bruising a path Mickey Ward and this film have taken to get there. kenneth.turanlatimes.com The Fighter MPAA rating R for language throughout drug content some violence and sexuality Running time 1 hour 55 minutes Playing At the ArcLight Hollywood MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESWith American Hustle David O.

Whenever a new one comes along they want to know where it ranks if at all in the pantheon that includes such classics as ""Raging Bull"" ""Rocky"" and ""The Champ."" In the case of ""The Fighter a perfectly remarkable movie directed by David O. Russell Id suggest a different pantheon one thats reserved for the sort of spectacularly toxic families dramatized by Eugene ONeill. While the film handles itself well in the ring its brilliant in the arena of a blue-collar family that brutalizes its younger son and best hope for worldly success in the name of sustaining him. Watch a clip from ""The Fighter"" starring Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale. A single image bespeaks both venues--recurrent almost robotic spasms of sparring between Micky Ward who is played by Mark Wahlberg and his half brother Dicky Eklund played by Christian Bale. (These are two phenomenal performances in fundamentally different styles.) Its the familiar image of a boxer working with his trainer yet the two men are locked in another kind of combat as well. Dicky the trainer was once a promising fighter who went the distance with Sugar Ray Leonard. (In a film based on a true story it remains a matter of dispute whether he knocked Sugar Ray down or whether his opponent simply slipped.) Now hes a wild-eyed crack-addicted caricature of his former self. Dicky may have taught his younger brother everything he knows about boxing but his continued presence as Mickys trainer has turned imprisoning. Instead of winning fights and moving up Micky stumbles from one seedy bout to another serving as a stepping stone for other fighters. Mr. Russell directed ""The Fighter"" with furious energy--the overlapping dialogue out-Altmans Robert Altman--and an exuberant sense of place (Lowell Mass. in the 1990s). The director has an unerring feel for his working-class characters and hes generous toward most of them though what he does with the brothers six sisters a kind of slatternly Greek chorus is hilariously grotesque. The script episodic but never uninteresting was written by Scott Silver Paul Tamasy and Eric Johnson. Hoyte Van Hoytema did the gritty cinematography a far cry from the cool formal beauty of his work in ""Let the Right One In."" ENLARGE Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale as battling brothers in The Fighter. Paramount Pictures The production does all of its participants proud. Mr. Wahlberg who had long championed a feature film about the brothers chose to play the role thats initially distinguished by its passivity. His performance is truly distinguished and deeply affecting. Micky has become more of a punching bag than anything else. He supports his family by absorbing physical punishment. The flamboyant role belongs to Mr. Bale. At the outset he seems to be playing it for crackpot grandiosity--Dicky sees himself as the star of a documentary thats being made about his career--but the documentary proves to be anything but admiring and Mr. Bales performance grows into a chilling study of deterioration and rage. (In one brief but frightening moment his little son imitates him by taking a punch at a locker door.) Family is the films central issue and a flinty conundrum when do familial ties become shackles and chains? Mickys family isnt dysfunctional its ruthlessly functional in destructive ways. According to its matriarch and business manager Alice--a formidable performance by Melissa Leo--Dicky still knows whats best for his brothers dwindling career. But Alices steely authority meets its unlikely match in the person of Mickys new girlfriend Charlene a college dropout whos tending bar in a local tavern. (Shes played by Amy Adams who is as tough tender smart and funny as she was ethereal and delightful in ""Enchanted."" What an actress and what range) Once Charlene enters the fray the plot takes a few arbitrary lurches but also some thrilling turns. Against all odds ""The Fighter"" snatches hope and then elation from the jaws of grinding defeat. Watch a clip from ""The Tourist"" starring Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp. ENLARGE Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp in The Tourist. Columbia PIctures The Tourist Sometimes it can be grisly fun to watch a movie thats been kept from view until the last moment because the studio knows its a stinker. But watching ""The Tourist"" with Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp is just plain grisly. This woefully botched mystery-adventure-thriller-caper-romance-comedy or whatever it was meant to be is no fun at all. In fact the film set in Venice is grisly plus saddening since it was directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck the German filmmaker whose Oscar-winning debut feature ""The Lives of Others"" remains a recent treasure of the movie medium. Who knows how his pursuit of a Hollywood career landed him in such a rancid stew? The only clue is provided by surveillance. ""The Lives of Others"" was about East Germanys secret surveillance of its citizens whereas ""The Tourist"" involves the obsessive and sometimes electronic surveillance of Ms. Jolie as a sex object. She plays Elise a mysterious--or at least frozen-faced--sophisticate opposite Mr. Depps Frank who describes himself as a math teacher from Wisconsin. (The idiotic plot which never adds up has to do with money gangsters and mistaken identity.) Mr. Depp possibly expressing displeasure at the production as a whole plays his character with dead eyes and steadfast torpor. Ms. Jolies eyes arent dead exactly but theyre weirdly glazed and they work in concert with her pursed lips and exclamation-mark posture to create a kind of sex robot who swans around Venice as if on an invisible runway. Maybe that was her intention but no one could have intended what ""The Tourist"" came to be. Watch a clip from ""All Good Things"" starring Ryan Gosling and Kirsten Dunst. All Good Things Andrew Jareckis first narrative feature takes a fictional look at a once-notorious and still unsolved missing persons case. The result is a queasy combination of speculation and dramatic invention with the ring of half-truth though the co-stars Ryan Gosling and Kirsten Dunst add as much color as they can--not much--to a monochromatic script. The case involved Kathie Durst the wife of Robert Durst the son of a wealthy New York real-estate magnate. When she disappeared in 1982 her husband came under immediate suspicion but her body was never found and he was never tried for her murder. Because he remains a free man the filmmakers have changed the real-life names but theyve retained many of the circumstances--the title was taken from the name of the Vermont health-food store that the couple opened early in their marriage. And they have left little doubt that Mr. Dursts surrogate David Marks was not only a tortured monster but a murderer. Seven years ago in his debut documentary feature ""Capturing the Friedmans"" Mr. Jarecki used a remarkable trove of home movies and video footage to probe the mysteries of a Long Island family torn apart by charges involving child pornography and pedophilia. The results were enthralling although mysteries remained. In ""All Good Things"" mystery and ambiguity are in short supply. The script draws insistently obvious psychological connections. Frank Langellas Sanford Marks the family patriarch and Davids father suffocates his scenes as well as Davids spirit with a doomy presence. While Ms. Dunsts Katie is lovely at first the single-minded writing reduces her to bleak cliches. As for Mr. Gosling hes one of our finest actors and I cant wait to see him later this month in ""Blue Valentine"" but his talents are mostly trapped by Davids eerie inwardness and inexpressiveness. In a movie that professes to reopen a cold case the heros inner life remains a closed book. The Company Men In a somber drama that plays like a requiem for the American Dream you may welcome a few frivolities like the bedroom scene when Maria Bellos glamorous hatchet woman Sally throws herself on Tommy Lee Joness Gene a veteran shipyard chief and says ""Tell me more about capital depreciation."" A feature film debut by the veteran TV writer-producer John Wells ""The Company Men"" tells us much about the human costs of a fragile economy by tracking the experience of three men during a savage spasm of corporate downsizing. The movie is set in the present and the picture isnt pretty. ""American heavy manufacturing is dead"" declares the CEO of a conglomerate that includes ship building. The trios task is to find life in the postindustrial ruins. (Roger Deakins did a stylish job as always of photographing not only the ruins but the offices and board rooms of the companys sleek headquarters.) In addition to Mr. Jones the cast includes Ben Affleck as Bobby a corporate executive who cant believe that downward mobility will threaten his suburban house his golf club or his Porsche (Kevin Costner plays Bobbys carpenter brother-in-law); and Chris Cooper as Phil an industrial counterpart to Willy Loman who definitely can put a nut to a bolt having begun his career as a welder. For all his years doing ""E.R."" and other top-line TV series Mr. Wells hasnt yet tailored his techniques to the big screen. His actors line readings can be erratic--though I very much liked Rosemarie DeWitts performance as Bobbys wife--and the episodic ""E.R.""-like structure of the script vitiates the films emotional impact. Still ""The Company Men"" takes on its big subject forthrightly and in an era of service industries and financial instruments it celebrates the virtue of making useful things. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD FOCUS ENLARGE Flirting With Disaster (1996) David O. Russells sensationally funny second feature grabs your attention in the opening seconds when its hero Mel Coplin (Ben Stiller) announces the premise. Mel is adopted and has always wondered who his real parents are. Hes also married with a four-month-old baby boy. But he and his wife Nancy (Patricia Arquette) havent yet agreed on a name for their son because fatherhood has plunged Mel into an identity crisis that can be cured only by finding his roots. Tea Leoni is Tina Kalb the adoption agency case worker who wants to document his reunion for purposes of scholarly research. The Believer (2002) The mind of Danny Balint whos played with terrifying brilliance by Ryan Gosling works like a cracked prism that refracts lifes spectrum into black and white. Danny is Jewish a conceited yeshiva boy grown into a pugnacious young man. Danny is also an anti-Semitic skinhead who vandalizes synagogues and has no higher ambition in his cracked life than to kill Jews. Henry Beans remarkable film has troubled many viewers and no wonder. What its about is also what it requires for proper appreciation--the ability of the human mind to hold and even cherish diametrically opposite thoughts. Boiler Room (2000) Ben Affleck is Jim Young a charismatic bully--and acknowledged descendant of Alec Baldwins character in ""Glengarry Glen Ross""--riding herd on young wannabe millionaires as they pitch worthless stocks to gullible traders. Ben Youngers debut feature has dramatic energy--and money hunger--to match the giddy heights of the Dow at the time it was made. Giovanni Ribisi is the conflicted hero Seth Davis a judges son who dropped out of college to run an illegal casino in his apartment. The ensemble cast includes Vin Diesel Nia Long Tom Everett Scott and Nicky Katt. --Joe Morgenstern Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

"Wahlberg and Bales The Fighter comes out swinging - USATODAY.com Cars  Auto Financing  Event Tickets  Jobs  Real Estate  Online Degrees Shopping SearchHow do I find it?Subscribe to paper Home News Travel Money Sports Life Tech Weather Life >> Movies Box Office Report Movie Listings Awards Central Shop for Movies/DVDs Wahlberg and Bales The Fighter comes out swinging Updated  | Review  | Recommend E-mail | Print | Enlarge By JoJo Whilden Paramount Pictures Young Micky (Mark Wahlberg right) tries to come into his own while his troubled half-brother Dicky (Christian Bale) lives on his own past glory enabled by their mother (Melissa Leo). ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Fighter   1/2 out of four Stars Christian Bale Mark Wahlberg Amy Adams Melissa LeoDirector David O. RussellDistributor Paramount PicturesRating R for language throughout drug content some violence and sexualityRunning time 1 hour 54 minutesOpens Friday in select cities By Claudia Puig USA TODAY The members of ex-fighter Dicky Eklunds family are so punch-drunk with love for the charming bad boy that they wont acknowledge the dangerous road hes on. Visionary director David O. Russell so deftly weaves the familys story that we too are initially seduced by Dicky. The Fighter opens with Dicky (Christian Bale) and his half-brother Micky (Mark Wahlberg) showboating for a documentary crew. Something feels off. The pair ambles down the street. Micky nods and smiles at locals but Dickys moves are the very definition of swagger. He casually tosses an arm over his younger brothers shoulders and flashes a goofy smile glad-handing whomever he sees. Boasting incessantly about his impending big comeback Dicky bobs almost in step with The Heavys infectiously funky tune How Do You Like Me Now and the audience is hooked. Look closer and see his bugged-out eyes missing teeth and twitchy movements. Though its based on the true story in the 1980s of boxing half-brothers ""Irish"" Micky Ward and Dicky Eklund this is no run-of-the-mill underdog-makes-good story. Dicky cruises on past glory. The legend is he knocked out Sugar Ray Leonard years before though some speculate that Leonard tripped. But the reality is that the swaggering charmer once known in his Massachusetts hometown as ""the pride of Lowell"" is now a crack addict and criminal. And Micky the younger brother who idolized him must get his own career before another life is wasted. Russells jangly camera style meshes perfectly with Bales tweaky energy. Bale is astounding as a strangely charismatic weasel giving probably the best performance of his career. Suave Bruce Wayne of 2005s Batman is long gone Bales handsome face is almost unrecognizably gaunt. Wahlberg has the less showy role but hes excellent as the decent son who cant compete for the affections of his manipulative mother (a pitch-perfect Melissa Leo.) A singular storyteller Russell doesnt shy away from the complex and chaotic. When he gets it right as with 1999s Three Kings its brilliant. There are nine in the family most of them sisters a bouffant virulent version of the seven dwarves. Micky is ultimately tugged out of his dysfunctional family cocoon by feisty Charlene (Amy Adams) a bartending townie. Adams plays against type proving her versatility beyond pert and perky. When Micky suddenly he has a chance to come into his own his signature tune going into the ring is Whitesnakes Here I Go Again a lament about walking along ""the lonely street of dreams."" Wahlberg is said to have spent half a decade duking it out to get The Fighter made. Thank goodness for his tenacity. The Fighter is one of the years best films. Bales knockout performance should not be missed. Dicky steals the show much like he does his familys attention.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + The thing about boxing movies is that theyre never really about the boxing. Theyre about everything else the fighter has to contend with family friends anger addictions the often-corrupt machinery of professional sports the bodys failure in the face of age and abuse. David O. Russells ""The Fighter is no different. Otherwise it would place Micky Wards legendary 2002-2003 trio of fights with Arturo Gatti at the center of the movie instead of relegating them to a mention just before the end credits roll.A Ward biopic without Gatti? Thats like a Muhammad Ali movie without Joe Frazier. Yet ""The Fighter is this close to a triumph a movie that steeps us in the grit of its time and place -- Lowell Mass. in the 1990s -- and electrifyingly dramatizes Wards battles with the family that almost loved him to death.The first person we see is Mickys half-brother Dickie Eklund and its a horrifying sight. Christian Bale has gone back to his skeletal ""Machinist weight for the role. His eyes bright and hollow he sits on a couch for an HBO interview and proclaims his readiness for a ring comeback. Everyone but Dickie seems to realize hes in a documentary about crack addiction.Dickie had his shot in 1978 when he knocked Sugar Ray Leonard to the canvas (and hed be the first to throw a punch if you suggest Leonard might have slipped). Now hes training his kid brother (Mark Wahlberg) with constant input from the boys pit bull of a manager-mother Alice (Melissa Leo) and her seven fearsome daughters. No wonder Mickys record in the ring is inconsistent -- he has never drawn a breath for himself. Every hook every jab is second-guessed by people who know better.""The Fighter spans the years 1993 to 2000 when Ward pulled away from his family to make a name for himself. After a disastrous bout against an over-matched last-minute replacement (Mike Mungin; the fight actually took place in 1988) Micky understands hes fighting Dickies battles not his. With the backing of his girlfriend Charlene (Amy Adams) he finds a new manager and new trainers slowly pulling himself up the rungs toward title contention. It helps that Dickies in prison for much of this time after a ridiculous shakedown scheme to raise money for his brother has gone bad.Indeed at its punchy profane best ""The Fighter struts along the line between melodrama and comedy. The first time Dickie jumps out a crackhouse window into a dumpster to avoid his mother its alarming; the second time its farce. If the older brother is known as ""The Pride of Lowell you sense that Lowells more than a little embarrassed about the honor. Actually Im curious what Lowell will think of the movie as a whole since it paints the town a deep bilious gray. A decade-plus of Boston-area movies has rubbed our noses in the yawp of working-class neighborhoods but never as relentlessly as this. The triple-deckers sag with decay and the faces are bloodshot with vanished hopes. You watch half-wondering if theres a statute for civic libel but also rapt because Russell makes the place jump with life his camera swiveling to catch every desperate street-corner showdown.He shoots the fights on video a tactic thats the opposite of ""Raging Bull-style operatics. It works The high-key lighting and the jagged VHS lines give the punches immediacy and even if you know the outcome youre caught up in the suspense expecting the worst because thats what Mickys used to.Yet as well-made as ""The Fighter is the performances put it over. As Dickies the loudmouthed star of his extended clan Bale is the secret star of this movie his ruinous charisma stealing the spotlight from the little brother with talent. The actor is mesmerizing unpredictable much too much -- you realize why people are drawn to Dickie and also why they give him a wide berth. Im not sure whether Bale should be nominated for best actor best supporting actor or best animated feature.With her frosted hair and tips that hide claws Leo also goes the distance as Alice overacting in the service of motherly venom. Mama Ward brooks no rebellion; when Mickys dad (Jack McGee) suggests the boy might be better off with other management he gets a frying pan to his head for his pains. A shout-out too to the chorus of sisters Irish-American furies who include in their number Conan OBriens sister Kate and the redoubtable Jill Quigg (""Gone Baby Gone) a bouillon cube of pure Bay State meanness.Yet its Mark Wahlbergs movie and not just because he spent years trying to get it made. The star has the tricky role of a soft-spoken man in a family of loudmouths and his power in and out of the ring builds in satisfying increments. The scenes with Adamss Charlene are tender and unexpectedly moving; Micky has finally met someone willing to listen. You could say that Wahlbergs playing Wahlberg. You could also say the stars stubborn gentleness fits the part so well it doesnt matter.""The Fighter is so good so engrossing for so long that its failure to find an ending to match is perplexing. In part the shape of its subjects life works against tidy storytelling The family issues dramatized here were resolved years before the fights with Gatti that made Wards name. Yet the climactic March 2000 bout with Shea Neary isnt the best replacement since it closely replicates a fight earlier in the film. As the credits roll you hear the wind whistling out of the movies sails -- or maybe its our own disappointment that life doesnt snap together as neatly as ""Rocky. ""The Fighter doesnt go out with a bang but with the less showy sound of a man winning a bigger battle by decision.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Send Feedback. Share Tweet With the notable exception of his exuberant performance as the unstoppable Dieter Dengler in Werner Herzogs Rescue Dawn Christian Bale has spent the decade since American Psycho playing roles that showcase his anger austerity or some combination of the two. Its been so easy to forget the charismatic star behind all that jaw-clenching seriousness that his remarkable turn as Dickie Eklund in The Fighter comes as a welcome surprise. Looking nearly as gaunt as he famously did for The Machinist Bale plays a crack-addicted former boxer--the ""pride"" of working-class Lowell Massachusetts--who seems to earn second third and fourth chances purely on the basis of his crooked smile and shambling underdog charm. Bales live-wire performance typifies the many major and minor elements that elevate The Fighter from the deeply conventional sports movie it might have been into the endearingly offbeat sports movie it turns out to be. Based on a true story the film focuses on the relationship between half-brothers Dickie a former palooka whose greatest achievement was a spirited showing against Sugar Ray Leonard and Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) a bruising welterweight whose loyalty to his flaky brother and brassy controlling mother (Melissa Leo) has stunted his growth. Mickys relationship with a bartender (Amy Adams) gives him the confidence and support to consider a different course but at the expense of a painful fallout with his family. Stories about working-class boxers punching above their station arent exactly new but director David O. Russell (Three Kings) and his team do everything they can to evoke the humble setting and the complex--and often quite funny--dynamic between Micky and a family that doesnt always have his best interests at heart. Wahlberg normally disappears in quieter roles but here he subtly conveys the weak impressionable kid who quivers behind his hulking exterior. The film occasionally gets too cartoonish with the local color but its tone is brash and big-hearted and the decision to go broad leaves plenty of room for Bale to play Dickie as New Englands answer to Ratso Rizzo. The Fighter doesnt try to upend the genre but its a reminder of how satisfying these movies can be when theyre done right.

But by the mid-80s he had become a crack addict and a local nuisance. In The Fighter directed by David O. Russell Dicky has a habit of leaping out of second-story windows and into a dumpster whenever anyone knocks on the door of the crack house he frequents. Looking at Bale rolling about in the bursting bags of garbage -- barely recognizable with a mouthful of bad teeth crazy eyes and an addicts bone-thin frame -- the less charitable moviegoer may think this is Dickys natural habitat. (See the evolution of Christian Bale in photos.) The role is pure Oscar bait but as convincingly wretched as he is Bale is ultimately less riveting than Mark Wahlberg who plays Micky Ward Eklunds younger half brother -- a welterweight boxer who became a champion both because of and despite his charismatic sibling who served as his trainer for most of his career. The Fighter is about boxing but its mostly a portrait of people trapped in the confusing cycle of co-dependency. (See the top 10 boxing matches of all time.) Wahlberg has the requisite tough physicality but his emotional take on Micky is pleasingly delicate. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema shoots him in a constant state of isolation and worry harkening back to the way he photographed the young protagonist of the 2008 Swedish vampire film Let the Right One In. Stylistically it works because while Micky is no wimp hes emotionally vulnerable and bullied by his own family. Hes wary but not jaded simple but not stupid. You get the sense he would skip the fights altogether if Dicky were still in the game. Wahlbergs gentle warmth is a welcome contrast to Bales studied meticulous performance. Impressive chameleon Melissa Leo (Frozen River Homicide) plays Dicky and Mickys hard-as-nails almost criminally delusional mother Alice. Leo is 50 Wahlberg is 39 and Bale 36; out of all of them shes the best at acting her screen age. Alice is a classic type stretch pants a pack of cigarettes glued to her palm wings of bleached blonde hair standing at stiff attention atop her head. Although shes mother to nine children by two fathers -- an enormous pack of shrewish daughters follow her around like a litter of pit bulls -- Alice is forever focused on her pride and joy Dicky. She refuses to acknowledge his drug problem and lives in anticipation of his comeback. In the meantime she serves as Mickys manager with the primary goal of having him make Dicky look good. After Micky is brutalized by a heavier tougher opponent Alice just wants him to slap on a Band-Aid and thank his half brother for the opportunity. This crew would all wallow in each other if it werent for the catalyst of Charlene (Amy Adams) Mickys new bartender girlfriend who pushes him to stand up to his family. The sister harpies take an instant dislike to Charlene accusing her of putting on airs (she went to college briefly). The scene in which Micky takes her home to the snake pit is missing only Kristen Wiig to be a Saturday Night Live skit called ""The House of Skanks"" but Charlene -- and Adams -- holds her own. The Enchanted star tends to play innocents but shes convincingly tough here and she and Wahlberg have heady earthy chemistry. When Dicky goes off to prison it is Charlene who helps Micky get back in the ring without him. (In a neat little twist Mickey OKeefe the Lowell cop who took over the real Micky Wards training plays himself in his acting debut.) Wahlberg establishes the kind of goodwill that keeps us engaged by Mickys shot at the title even though it would have been enough to make this a story of his empowerment and budding independence from his family. But the screenplay credited to three writers has that overdoctored feeling to it and were asked to take on a larger redemption tale that undermines the truth of Bales wholly unsympathetic portrayal of a drug addict and a narcissist. The Fighters desire to show us what that awful combination looks like is overwhelmed by its urge to show us a Hollywood-style triumph. In the movies coda the real Micky and Dicky filmed hanging out in Lowell talk about how great the whole filmmaking experience was. Dicky whose speech and movements Bale captured uncannily does most of the talking. Theres no mention of his more recent arrests including one involving crack possession after the events of the movie took place. Presumably that would have interfered with the happy ending.

But even if his trials tribulations and triumphs are familiar you wont be bored by the way director David O. Russell (Three Kings) and his dynamite cast tell the tale. Its easy to say when its over that The Fighter falls into a familiar rousing-sports-movie formula. But if you are blissfully ignorant of the true story you likely wont know which way this psychologically complex family saga is heading. The suspense isnt just about whos going to win the big fight but whos going to emerge from Wards big fierce jungle of a family with their lives intact. Unlike most boxing movies the cruelest blows in The Fighter are internal.Micky (Mark Wahlberg) has lost three fights in a row when we pick up his story in 1993 in his blue-collar Lowell Mass. hometown. His trainer is his older half-brother Dicky Ecklund (Christian Bale) whose moment of glory was having once knocked down Sugar Ray Leonard. Micky is fiercely loyal to his brother and its wrecking his career. Hollow-cheeked motormouthed and out of control Dicky is a charismatic crack addict whose addiction is being documented by an HBO film crew. Bale who may be the scariest actor in the business is poisonously good here.Dicky isnt the only scary family member theres Alice (Melissa Leo) the boys mom and manager a brassy chain-smoking blonde whose denial about her sons crack habit is as ferocious as her antipathy to Mickys new girlfriend the smart and tough barmaid Charlene (a terrific Amy Adams) the only one strong enough to stand up to her. Leo is almost unrecognizable as this malign matriarch and shes unforgettable. Adding gaudy color to this dysfunctional working-class family are the boys seven shrill sisters who loll about the household exhaling cigarette smoke and bad attitude. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Its only when Micky summons the bravery to step away from this rats nest of codependence and self-destruction that his fighting career gets back on track. Just as Micky steps out of the shadow of his older brother--whos off serving prison time--the beauty of Wahlbergs quiet watchful performance emerges from the dazzle of Bales bravura turn. When a clean Dicky returns home wanting to reclaim his old position in Mickys corner its hard not to root against him is he truly reformed or as dangerous as ever?This is only Russells fifth feature--its been six years since I Heart Huckabees--and as always he refuses to repeat himself stylistically. Urgent gritty sometimes weirdly funny The Fighter might be considered his first feel-good movie.

By Anthony Lane Christian Bale Mark Wahlberg and Amy Adams in David O. Russells movie.   Credit Illustration by ROBERT RISKO Is David O. Russells ""The Fighter"" really a boxing movie? It certainly reeks of the ring and the plotline culled from life follows the ascent of Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) a welterweight from Lowell Massachusetts who became a world champion in 2000 and remains a hero to his people today. Split the movie into a dozen rounds though and only about three of them would be adjudged boxing-based. What powers ""The Fighter"" is not glory with gloves on but the rough bare-knuckled rapport that Ward maintains with his mother and his siblings. This is in the fullest and sweatiest sense family entertainment. The resident matriarch is Alice (Melissa Leo) herself as hard as a heavyweight. Even her hair is hard brushed up and styled to the point of immobility. You might think her poor husband merely henpecked until you watch her sling pots and pans at him across the kitchen for daring to question her judgment. Some pecking. Some hen. Alice has borne a formidable brood including a squadron of Celtic daughters--seven of them sometimes all shouting abuse at once. I used to think the witches in ""Macbeth"" were a scary bunch but Alices girls make them look like the Andrews Sisters. As for Micky he is the cynosure of his mothers eye. ""All we ever wanted for you was to be world champion"" she tells him. No pressure there then. Micky is trained by his half brother Dicky (Christian Bale) a former boxer. He once had Sugar Ray Leonard on the floor he says--and goes on saying to anyone who will listen though rumor has it that Leonard slipped. But most people no longer listen to Dicky. Halfway between skeleton and ghost he lives in a crack house. Bale is the first thing we see in the film. Gaunt as a saint preparing for martyrdom his eyes gazing without a blink from sunken sockets he jabbers and grins; there is a film crew within the film making a documentary for HBO and hes hopped up by the presence of the camera. (It takes us a while to realize that Micky tacit and modest is sitting right next to him.) The starlight lingers even when Dicky having impersonated a police officer and then assaulted a real one goes to jail and shivers through cold turkey. When his program finally airs he parades through his fellow-cons enrobed in their applause and takes his seat in front of the TV like a god before his own altar. All of this creates a dazzling portrait of delusion and one hell of a cautionary tale for any viewers planning to curdle their brains with drugs but theres a hitch so thoroughly does Bale embrace the part that the dazzle threatens to outblaze the drama. You dont find yourself thinking What a wild and wasted soul that Dicky is. You think Wow look at Christian Bale playing a wild and wasted soul. What an ace job hes doing. So much acting. Theres a hint but only a hint of the same thing in Amy Adams in the role of Mickys girlfriend Charlene. As she bends over in denim hot pants at the bar where she works to reveal a tattoo at the base of her spine we realize that Charlene represents a radical departure for Adams who may well be starting to tire of all the nuns cooks princesses and other assorted honeys she normally gets to play. There is nothing honeyed about Charlene; against stiff competition she has the dirtiest mouth in the movie though her task is a virtuous one--to pull Micky from the wreckage of his kin as if from a burning plane. ""Everybody said I could beat him"" Micky tells her after a disastrous cheek-splitting bout with a fighter almost twenty pounds heavier. ""Whos everybody?"" Charlene asks. ""My mother and my brother"" Micky says. As for what the mother makes of that brother we are asked to believe that Alice doesnt truly understand Dickys crack habit until she sees it aired or smoked out on HBO. Yeah right. Not even Melissa Leo fierce and flinty actress that she is can pull that one off. For all the bluster ""The Fighter"" jostles dangerously close to the corny. Maybe thats an occupational hazard of the boxing movie which traditionally balances the physical prospect of beating someone out of his senses with the more edifying notion of having good sense beaten back in. Hence the ""Rocky"" franchise and hence the conventional climax of ""The Fighter"" with Micky confronting an Irishman named Shae Neary (Anthony Molinari) who appears to be hewn from basalt. We could be watching a Ron Howard picture. In short its a curious project for David O. Russell the maker of ""I Heart Huckabees"" (2004) and the jitters in mood here from melodrama to semi-farce and from blue-collar grit to teary triumphalism suggest a director striving to keep control of bumpy material. When Russell broke through with ""Three Kings"" (1999) the result was no less multilayered but it was a found complexity you felt inherent in the messiness of war to which Russell was calmly doing justice. There is a Micky Ward story ironically that might have suited Russell better. Not the one that closed with Neary in 2000 but the one that began two years later with the first of Wards three matches against Arturo Gatti--a three-act drama if ever there was one starring two guys who when they werent trying to annihilate each other became loyal friends. To some aficionados the first was the fight of the century so far. Even in the mini-ring of YouTube itll knock you flat whereas ""The Fighter"" for all the dedication of its players takes a heavy swing at us and misses. Despite the title ""I Love You Phillip Morris"" is not a bravely unfashionable hymn of praise to the tobacco industry. What it offers more implausible still is a chance to see Jim Carrey make out with Ewan McGregor. The chance arises when Steven Russell (Carrey) goes to jail for fraud and falls at first gasp for the Phillip of the title (McGregor) a gentle ginger-blond with an accent quivering somewhere in the mid-Atlantic. The rest of the film is absorbed less by the pursuit of love--for Phillip returns Stevens affections forthwith--than by the headlong pursuit of everything that will make the love run sweetly. Here you might say is a genuine romance its ardor unquenched by distance confinement and death. On the other hand in the touching words of Phillip ""Enough romance. Lets fuck."" In some ways we are not that far from ""The Fighter."" Both movies present a prison term less as an ordeal than as something manageable redemptive and useful. Both are also based on fact; according to the final credits of ""I Love You Phillip Morris"" the true Steven Russell currently resides in a Texas penitentiary--on twenty-three-hour lockdown if you can believe it. The moral of the film however is that you cant believe anything at all not with Steven around. Mendacity is his proper state. Not content with a sheaf of dodgy credit cards he pretends to be the chief financial officer of a major company and thinks nothing of adopting the weighty tones of a judge on the phone to get himself bailed. This brand of shape-shifting is as easy as pie for Carrey and I like the idea of all that elasticated verve and boundless good will being turned to nefarious ends. So why has the movie languished on remand awaiting release since January 2009 when it screened at Sundance? Dont Carrey addicts merit quicker service? Well aside from those who may be mildly discomfited by watching their hero whoop and holler like a rodeo rider as he gets it on with a gentleman described in the credits as ""The Moustached Man"" many will find the films geniality wearing thin and false. You could argue that falsity is Stevens stock-in-trade but there is a further more unpleasant falsity in the guttering emotional tone. Glenn Ficarra and John Requa the writers of ""Bad Santa"" (2003) wrote and directed this movie and once again they proceed on the assumption that taste is no more than a silly shackle to be snapped and tossed away. Is it that funny though to be shown how to fake your own death from AIDS? And how does such deceit affect the flashback in which Steven professes love to an earlier partner who is dying of the same disease? Are all tears meant to be crocodile? Steven tries to catch us out at regular intervals with a shot of unreliable narration (""Oh did I forget to mention Im gay?"" or ""Theres something I didnt tell you"") but the filmmakers attempt to enshrine him as an enigma unknowable and arcane is defeated by our dawning realization that he is unmistakably a jerk. At best ""I Love You Phillip Morris"" may be hailed as a necessary step in Hollywoods fearful crawl toward sexual evenhandedness; the film upholds the constitutional right of every gay man to be as much of a liar a crook and a creep as the rest of us.

Russell; Release Date Wide 12/10/2010; Distributor Paramount Pictures Posted December 24 2010 -- 1200 AM EST In the films of recent years that have taken place in and around Boston the location isnt just a setting a row-house look or an occasion for showy pahk the cah accents. Its a state of mind. And in no recent movie has that state of mind been more colorful more blood-tie pungent more tribal than it is in The Fighter. A true-life rise-of-the-underdog boxing saga directed with volatile handheld immediacy by David O. Russell (Three Kings) its set in Lowell Mass. the working-class Beantown satellite city that if anything incarnates the proudly parochial macho Irish Catholic essence of Boston more purely than Boston does. The central figure Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) is an up-and-coming welterweight who is being groomed to become the next ""pride of Lowell."" The original pride of Lowell is his older half brother Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale) a local boxing legend-turned-layabout who cemented his 15 minutes of glory back in the 80s when he knocked down Sugar Ray Leonard in the middle of a headline bout. But did he really knock him down or did Sugar Ray just trip? That very confusion is presented as the epitome of Lowell a city of tough bruised underdog egos who are forever fighting for their status. When Micky muscular and ambitious a little shy but determined goes down to the gym to spar with his retired bro who has been training him for this moment ever since Micky was a kid he seems to have everything going for him. In reality though he has everything hanging over him the mythical status of his brother; the expectations of his feisty clinging family -- his domineering manager mother Alice (Melissa Leo) and half a dozen frowzy big-haired sisters; and the mystique of Lowell itself. To complicate matters Dicky once a hero has devolved into a fractious motormouthed crack addict who hides his addiction behind a brashness thats a half step from craziness. He comes on as Mickys ally but may in fact be his greatest liability. Can Micky cut him loose to become the champion he was meant to be? Thats the question that drives The Fighter and part of what makes the movie such a satisfying emotionally rounded tale of pugilistic passion and family psychodrama is that the answer isnt as simple as it looks. Wahlberg doing his soft-spoken/explosive sensitive-bruiser thing is perfect as the young man who must consider dropping his dysfunctional clan to triumph in the ring. And Bale cadaverous and google-eyed with a jack-o-lantern grin and an energy so manic it borders on the obscene finally takes the compulsion toward Method eccentricity thats been driving him for close to a decade and makes it pay off. His Dicky is that rare thing a wing nut with soul and a touch of tragedy too. Melissa Leo in a glue-spray bouffant is vital as the kind of boxing-world stage mother who could kill a kid with love and Amy Adams as the bartender who becomes Mickys girlfriend has a spot-on tough-chick allure. Theres a certain predictability to The Fighter yet thats part of the appeal of the fight genre. This one as thoughtful as it is rousing scores a TKO.

Russells ""The Fighter"" REVIEW | Lords of the Ring David O. Russells ""The Fighter"" Eric Kohn Dec 8 2010 236 am erickohn Share This Article Pin It Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Print Talk Wildly uneven and about as entertaining ""The Fighter"" is committed to the rambunctious masculine energy of the boxing ring. Sustained by a triple threat of performances by Mark Wahlberg Christian Bale and Amy Adams David O. Russells dramatization of star boxing brothers ""Irish"" Mickey Ward (Wahlberg) and half-brother Dicky Eklund (Bale) sticks to the old-fashioned trajectory of the sports movie mold. Russell navigates the usual hoops with more efficiency than the market standard relying on naturalistic performances and speedy momentum to keep viewers hooked but never reaches the uniquely sardonic tone present in the rest of his work (""I Heart Huckabees"" ""Three Kings""). Eccentricity takes a backseat to the familiar. Set outside Boston in Lowell Massachusetts during the early 1990s ""The Fighter"" transpires in a stylized world of the thick-accented hot-blooded Irish American middle class where people glare at each other more often than they smile. As the story begins Dicky poses for HBO cameras ostensibly filming his comeback while suffering behind closed doors from a crack addiction that the rest of his family actively ignores. Meanwhile Mickey absorbs his brothers lost ambition ceaselessly training for a shot at the championship. Their mother (Melissa Leo) does double-duty as their manager watching over her childrens respective ambitions (and doting over seven daughters) with an aggressive matriarchal gaze. Beyond Dickys literal addiction the family seems hooked on its own crumbling legacy a destructive cycle marked by the constant desire to track down the next big opportunity. Mickey only manages to break way with the help of his new flame Charlene (Amy Adams) a foul-mouthed bartender willing to speak out against the familys iron grip on Mickeys life. The cast relishes each opportunity for intensity. Wahlberg portrays an understated innocent pitted against Bales wild-eyed time bomb of a performance which generates an amusing thrill factor whenever it avoids veering into camp. Adams finally discovers a role where she doesnt have to get dolled up for the camera and the ferocity suits her. Leo presents the freakiest embodiment of parental control since Jacki Weavers gangster-mom in ""Animal Kingdom."" The two womens characters view each other as threats hurling insults like bricks their eyes bulging with demonic rage as they squabble over the chaotic entanglement of their private and professional lives. Needless to say theyre more fun to watch than the boxing itself which turns into something of a problem. Whenever Mickey heads into the ring ""The Fighter"" loses much of its appeal and simply turns into a record of the sport in close-up. The technical aspects of the fights hold plenty of appeal recalling Frederick Wisemans recent documentary ""Boxing Gym"" which boiled the sport down to an unending avalanche of sweat and grunts. That texture opens up plenty of cinematic possibilities which Russell exploits through overlapping dialogue and the fierce thuds of punches colliding with flesh making this awards season movie stand out as a contender for best sound design more than anything else. But those same moments are devoid of any lasting substance. The stakes never build and the finale feels like an afterthought. Outside of the ring ""The Fighter"" hums along with a series of melodramatic twists especially once Dickys sudden incarceration throws the family dynamic into jeopardy. Yet even as individual scenes hum along the movie has an erratic progression as if Russell and screenwriters Scott Silver Paul Tamasy and Eric Johnson couldnt decide if they wanted to go the ""Rocky"" route and emphasize the sports brutal nature or play up the familys larger relationship issues. The result is a rickety hodgepodge of both options. Bookended with ""fake"" interviews featuring Bale and Wahlberg speaking to the camera in character the movie reveals the inspiration for the roles by showing authentic interviews with the real Mickey and Dicky alongside the credits. Its a wise choice that allows us to see the accuracy of the two lead performances particularly the neat chemistry between the brothers that makes them ready-made for big screen drama. ""The Fighter"" adheres to a formula but then so do the competitors. criticWIRE grade B This Article is related to Reviews and tagged In Theaters The Fighter-2 More From IndieWireHow to Scare Yourself Shtless This Halloween A Viewers Guide (VIDEO)Exclusive Aja Naomi King Talks About Sci-Fi Thriller Reversion and the Power of Memories - Now in TheatersThe Films of David O.

Hoberman The Fighter Feels Rigged Wednesday December 8 2010 at 4 a.m. By J. Hoberman 1 Dont let that bastard breatheJoJo Whilden A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The Fighter is based on the true story of Lowell Massachusetts light welterweight champ ""Irish"" Micky Ward but starring Boston working-class hero Mark Wahlberg it plays as a Rocky-fied fairy tale for our time Consigned to Palookaville a sweet unassuming boxer with more heart than brains steps up--all the way to the top of the world.David O. Russells first movie in the six years since his star-studded New Age screwball comedy I Heart Huckabees crashed and burned at the box office The Fighter is a project that although always attached to Wahlberg passed through several hands including now-executive producer Darren Aronofskys before landing with Russell (who directed the actor in both Huckabees and Three Kings). Wahlberg trained for years to play Ward and his investment is evident but The Fighter doesnt seem an especially personal film for Russell By the time Micky faces off against an opponent so arrogant that he wont even shake hands the bouts have taken on the overdetermined rabble-rousing feel of professional wrestling.A fight film set to a tribal drum The Fighter plays out on the mean streets and in the dope dens of Clinton-era Lowell birthplace of Americas industrial revolution as well as Jack Kerouac. The first 30 minutes are rich in moxie thanks to Christian Bales wired wild-eyed performance as the former ""Pride of Lowell"" Wards older half-brother Dicky Eklund a noisy ghost living on crack fumes and memories of his fight with Sugar Ray Leonard. Micky like Dicky before him is (mis)-managed by his high-powered harridan mother (Melissa Leo) and supported by a scarifying seven-sister fan club. The movies first fight has the entire clan descending on Atlantic City where Irish Mickys original opponent (a black Jew) calls in sick enabling a last-minute substitute to batter Micky senseless in the first round. He subsequently breaks with his bloodsucking family when he takes up with the tough carnal barmaid (Amy Adams no Disney princess here) that his floozy sibs call the ""MTV girl."" Baless antics aside theres no hokum more entertaining in The Fighter than Adamss expression of total incredulity when she first meets Mickys maenads en masse--each of their faces frozen in a Medusa mask.Dicky may have been the subject of an HBO America Undercover doc (High on Crack Street Lost Lives in Lowell) but as presented by Russell the whole family is living a reality show--their domestic drama played out in full view of friends and neighbors. Indeed Mickys essential struggle is not in the ring or even against his big brother so much as it is with his mother who dotes on her fuck-up first-born boy (and enables his blatant scene-stealing). In the most show-stopping instance Bale successfully woos his angry mother not to mention the audience by breaking into an a cappella rendition of the Bee Gees lament ""I Started a Joke."" Its thanks to Bales Dicky (and Russells knack for choreographing mass confusion) that The Fighter has a measure of what Kerouac recalled in his boyhood-evoking Dr. Sax as ""the Lowell of mad midnights under gaunt pines by the lickety ticky moon.""Once upon a time Dicky might have been The Fighters fallen hero. Presaged by the Group Theaters 1939 production of Golden Boy post-World War II boxing films like Body and Soul Champion and The Set-Up were all about class struggle specifically the brutality of the capitalist system and the pathos of the proletariat; with few exceptions Hollywood boxers were tragic figures until Sylvester Stallone changed the game upping the genres ethnic ante and opting for a Cinderella structure to create one of the greatest success sagas in American movies. (The anti-Rocky Raging Bull garnered precious few kudos back in 1980; great filmmaking aside theres nothing feel-good about Martin Scorseses portrait of Jake LaMotta.) And so after a volatile first half Micky eclipses Dicky and The Fighter settles into a predictably rutted narrative arc. Although the movie ends before Mickys epic HBO-televised battles with Arturo Gatti The Fighter shares Rockys optimistic trajectory and then some.Even more than Rocky The Fighter gives boxing a social use-value. Just like a skillful politician Micky brings together everyone no matter how assholic to share in his success. ""A boxer like a writer must stand alone"" A.J. Liebling famously wrote. But The Fighter is less about individual struggle than group validation. I Heart Lowell To make Micky Ward it apparently took a village.Another bluntly titled exercise in hardboiled schmaltz Johnnie Tos Vengeance is the sort of movie that one would have felt privileged to discover on a 42nd Street triple bill back in the day. Something of a magpie assemblage the HK workhorses 50th feature tricks out four or five balletic gunfights and copious beaux gestes with lots of Macao local color a plot device lifted from Memento a bit of Wild Bunch camaraderie a measure of Melvillian melancholy and mainly the presence of ripely ravaged French icon Johnny Hallyday.Pin-point blue eyes hooded by a Borsalino fedora rugged features smeared across the Naugahyde slab of his face Hallyday is pure presence. The erstwhile French Elvis plays a hit man turned restaurateur who leaves his Champs-Elysees boite to avenge the Triad massacre of his daughter (Sylvie Testud) and her family engaging a trio of To regulars (Anthony Wong Lam Ka Tung Lam Suet) to track down and obliterate the killers. The plot pivots on a predictable hinge and is complicated by Hallydays fading memory--theres a pesky old bullet lodged in his brain. The Frenchman takes instant photographs of his crew so as to be able to recognize them later. (In one poignant gag he stands in a crowded marketplace helplessly trying to match his photos to individuals in a sea of look-alike Chinese.)Vengeance tempers tough-guy sentimentality with schoolyard existentialism. Ultimately Hallyday even forgets the meaning of the word ""revenge""; his loyal buddies have to remember the mission for him. So too To Its only his economically staged action scenes--a smoke-shrouded slo-mo shoot-out in a forest of falling leaves a garbage-dump last stand with rival gangs advancing on each other behind bales of trash cigarettes dangling from their lips and AKs at the ready--that make Vengeance stick in the mind.

The best boxing movies arent about the sport but what happens outside the ropes. If ""The Fighter"" doesnt quite measure up to the greats its because director David O. Russell seems confused about what to do between bouts. Strangely that unfocused quality -- vs. any breakthrough narrative angle -- gives the film its punch injecting Russells affectionately patronizing portrait of blue-collar pugs ""Irish"" Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) and half-brother Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale) with chaotic energy. More scenery-chewing contest than traditional boxing biopic this late-year Paramount release is being handled as prestige rather than mainstream fare but could connect despite itself particularly among those familiar with Ward. As a fighter Ward was known for taking a sustained beating for several rounds only to come back and knock out his opponents with a well-placed left hook. That would appear to be the model for the screenplay penned by Scott Silver (""8 Mile"") Paul Tamasy (the ""Air Bud"" movies) and Eric Johnson (from a story by Tamasy Johnson and Keith Dorrington) which tracks the punishing setbacks between Mickys return to boxing and his first title win. Though Wahlberg is a good decade older than his character the actor convincingly fills Mickys shoes from the outset essaying a less cocksure variation on the dreamer he played in ""Boogie Nights"" this time closer to home as a lower-class Massachusetts kid who makes good on a rocky upbringing. (Ward grew up in Lowell Mass. which served as the films primary location about an hour from Wahlbergs childhood haunts.) As age gaps go Bale has the trickier part playing Mickys significantly older brother despite being three years younger than Wahlberg -- a feat that involved receding his hairline thinning a bald spot in back and wearing a most unflattering set of crack-addict teeth. Dicky who served as Mickys idol and trainer steals the floor from the beginning talking over his more taciturn half-brother in a television interview and seeing Mickys early scraps as an extension of his own failed boxing career the high point of which was an HBO-broadcast bout with Sugar Ray Leonard. HBO is still interested in Dicky as the film opens only now theyre tracking him for a Lowell-based installment of ""America Undercover"" featuring once-promising lives destroyed by drugs. Its not insignificant to the look and feel of ""The Fighter"" that HBO was the one to document this chapter in the siblings lives since the network also rewrote the rules by which prize fights and family sagas are told. With the exception of one slo-mo montage the matches are depicted like pay-per-view events cutting between long shots and ringside reactions (as they would on TV complete with instant-replay capabilities and video-style pixelation) rather than privileged closeups. The influence of ""The Sopranos"" and such recent character-driven dramas as ""Mad Men"" (where by no mere coincidence Par featured its first extended preview for ""The Fighter"") can also be felt in Russells narrative style which isnt as clearly plot-driven as the many boxing movies that have come before. Instead he seems more invested in scenes that reveal his characters often-unarticulated insecurities and dreams as in the television premiere of the HBO expose (based on 1995s ""High on Crack Street"") which allows the director to cycle among his ensemble to observe how all the key players react to public humiliation. One could argue whether Micky or Dicky is the films main character but theres no denying that Dicky undergoes the more compelling arc. While Micky faces an oppressive family life and uphill romance with assertive out-of-his-league bartender Charlene (Amy Adams) Dicky must overcome addiction narcissism and defeat before he can let his little brother emerge the family champion. And what a family embodied by overbearing mother Alice (Melissa Leo) and a swarm of harpy sisters. If ""The Fighter"" feels like kind of a mess lurching from one scene to the next as if the film itself has taken a few hits to the head thats not entirely a bad thing. Since the story ends well before Mickys career-defining showdown with Arturo Gatti its just as well that lunatic setpieces allow talents such as Leo -- whose wickedly over-the-top turn disguises Alices cartoonish two-dimensionality -- to upstage anything Micky accomplishes in the ring. Still backed by a stellar group of unshowy character actors the glamour-averse marquee perfs range from Brando-esque mumbling to full-throttle histrionics with d.p. Hoyte Van Hoytemas intense handheld shooting style accommodating that range within a single cohesive world rounded out by tacky period-specific 90s production and costume design. As fiery dysfunction goes ""Spanking the Monkey"" and ""Flirting With Disaster"" were clearly just a warm-up for Russell. Whats missing are stakes and soul with the directors attention split between working-class elegy and white-trash caricature but missing the big picture.
