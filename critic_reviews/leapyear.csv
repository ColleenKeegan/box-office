Leap Year (unrated) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Leap Year (unrated) The latest exercise in minimalist Mexican cinema is a harrowing study of a sexual obsession. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com9/14/2011 Editor rating 3 Leap Year (Ano bisiesto) the latest entry in the growing genre of minimalist Mexican cinema takes place almost entirely inside a dingy one-bedroom apartment. With the exception of a brief prologue in which we observe Laura (Monica del Carmen) shopping at a grocery store and failing to catch the eye of a man she fancies director Michael Rowe never leaves her drab vaguely depressing flat shooting with a static camera in long takes. We watch as Laura a writer for a business magazine as she interviews people over the telephone and transcribes the taped conversation. We watch as she makes herself dinner and eats in front of the TV. We watch as she calls her mother and gets a visit from her younger brother (Marco Zapata). Most importantly we see Laura as she gets dolled up at night and goes out to clubs returning with a procession of men who have sex with her and then leave in a hurry. Laura seems unaware of the loneliness that is consuming her whole In one scene she masturbates while spying on a neighboring couple who are just sitting on the couch watching TV. Then she brings home Arturo (Gustavo Sanchez Parra) who likes to mix a little Samp;M into his sex. The difference between he and all the other men Laura has brought home is that Arturo comes back for seconds and thirds. Laura and Arturo share little about their lives. She tells him she hopes to be a mom someday. He tells her he wants to become an actor. The bulk of their relationship though is sex which becomes rougher and more degrading with each encounter. But Laura is so happy for the company -- and for the opportunity to please her mate -- that shes willing to suffer any indignities. She derives pleasure from them. Leap Year borrows from the notorious In the Realm of the Senses (although its not nearly as explicit) as much as it borrows from Chantal Akermans Jeanne Dilman 23 quai du Commerce 1080 Bruxelles (another housebound study of a lonely woman with an unusual sex life). Rowe an Australian living in Mexico who won the Camera dOr prize for best first film at Cannes in May completely eschews eroticism in favor of the emotional intimacy Laura and Arturo share. Despite their lack of verbal communication his willingness to reveal his darkest sexual impulses and her eagerness to allow him to play them out the couple form a bond much deeper and tighter than an ordinary affair. Near the start of Leap Year we see Laura mark the date of Feb. 29 on her wall calendar then watch her cross out the first date of the month. As the x-marks on the calendar multiply and the red-lettered day approaches we discover the importance of the date and begin to dread its inevitable arrival We are primed for something awful. But nothing about Leap Year plays out exactly like you expect and Rowe prefers to send you home with enigmatic questions instead of clear-cut answers. You may not fully understand Laura but chances are you wont be able to forget her. Cast Monica del Carmen Gustavo Sanchez Parra Marco Zapata. Director Michael Rowe. Screenwriters Michael Rowe Lucia Carreras. Producers Edher Campos Luis Salinas. A Strand Releasing studios release. Running time 88 minutes. In Spanish with English subtitles. Vulgar language considerable nudity graphic sex adult themes. Not suitable for viewers under 17. Plays Thursday Sept. 15-Sunday Sept. 18 in Miami-Dade only O Cinema.

Among Hollywoods more dubious customs is the long standing practice of opening lame romantic comedies the first weekend of January. ""Leap Year"" taxes the abundant charms of stars Amy Adams and Matthew Goode with scant payoff in the tradition of ""Bride Wars"" ""27 Dresses"" and ""Just Married."" I never realized Adams has a mole on the bottom of her chin but apparently director Anand Tucker (""Shopgirl"") didnt notice it either even when the cinematographer decided to creatively shoot the star from below. PAGE SIX JOHN LITHGOW LEAPS TO AMY AT PREMIERE PHOTOS AMY ADAMS LEADING MEN The all-around carelessness of the project extends to the by-the-numbers script credited to Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont (the team behind the immortal ""Made of Honor"" and ""Surviving Christmas"") reportedly with an anonymous assist from Oscar winner Simon Beaufoy (""Slumdog Millionaire"" ""The Full Monty""). I wouldnt blame Beaufoy for not wanting to take any credit for this painfully contrived hate-at-first-sight story about Anna (Adams) an uptight woman from Boston who somehow spends three days trying to cross Ireland a country roughly the size of Pennsylvania. Anna is on her way to Dublin to propose to her self-absorbed surgeon boyfriend (Adam Scott) on Feb. 29 taking advantage of an alleged Irish custom at the suggestion of her alcoholic dad (John Lithgow who seems embarrassed to collect his one-scene paycheck). Mostly Anna bickers with Declan (Goode) who agrees to drive her to Dublin even though she has nearly destroyed his inn by plugging in her cellphone without a current converter a gag that was actually better done in ""Just Married."" Would a well-dressed woman like Anna actually not pack an extra pair of shoes in her single carry-on bag? Yes she steps in cow dung. Forced to snog Declan? Check. Forced to share a room? Check. She gets drunk at a wedding? You betcha. Anna and Declans repartee isnt exactly Tracy and Hepburn. The best insult she can come up with is to call him a ""Lucky Charms leprechaun."" (Universal Pictures no doubt charged General Mills for the product plug.) She ""You will have to kill me before I pay you a dime"" He ""Now theres an idea"" I have a better one Rent ""Enchanted"" with Adams and watch Goode as Colin Firths boyfriend in his other current movie ""A Single Man."" ""Leap Year"" may be the least funny Hollywood comedy to take advantage of Irish tax credits since ""The Honeymooners."" lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Orange County star Tamra Barneys husband files for divo...

Actors charm cant save this rom-com from a cliched script Add to ... Liam Lacey From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Thursday Jan. 07 2010 255PM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 313PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Leap Year Directed by Anan Tucker Written by Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan Starring Amy Adamsand Matthew Goode Classification PG Leap Year is the second romantic comedy in a month following the Hugh Grant-Sarah Jessica Parker movie Did You Hear About the Morgans?  which proves the most charming of actors can be left flailing in the face of a feeble script and direction. In both films there are unnervingly long silences after the intended jokes where you imagine the screenwriters must have penciled in some down time for the rollicking laughs they expected. Leap Year stars the reliably endearing Amy Adams ( Julie and Julia Enchanted ) as Boston native Anna a professional real-estate ""stager"" who fluffs and prepares luxurious homes for potential buyers. Shes moving into her dream condo with her blow-dried BlackBerry-addicted cardiologist boyfriend (Adam Scott) but after four years he hasnt popped the question. Seasoned chick-flick fans will instantly recognize Anna as a standard postfeminist Hollywood type the romantically-starved overcontrolling young professional woman (substitute Jennifer Lopez Renee Zellweger or Katherine Heigl) whos adorable supercompetent and a bit stuck-up. What she needs to be taught is a lesson in romantic humility by the kind of boor she thinks she doesnt like. On the verge of moving into the condo of her dreams Anna mistakenly believes her beau is about to propose. When he heads off to Ireland for a conference instead she decides to follow him following a folk tradition that says women can propose to men once every four years on Feb. 29. Bad weather leaves her stranded in a town in Dingle in the southwest of Ireland where she hires a scruffily handsome surly pub owner Declan (Matthew Goode) to escort her to Dublin to meet her future husband. Essentially Leap Year is the umpteenth variation on Frank Capras 1934 classic It Happened One Night  in which the ill-matched couple is thrown together on a road trip where amidst a series of misadventures their initial antagonism gives way to romance. The predictable comic formula is in a sense part of what the audience contracts. Of course Anna must fall on her behind in mud and step in cow dung and share a small room with Declan for the night. What the contract doesnt include is that the execution should be so clumsily obvious that every moment should be telegraphed before and after it happens. But then director Tucker and screenwriters Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan ( Made of Honor Josie and the Pussycats ) have such a fondness for the trite they can make even the beautiful hills and stone-wall fenced fields of Kerry seem flat as the pages in a coffee-table book. Scenes are filled with flat-capped Irish locals who dispute fight and spend their lives in pubs holding forth on antiquated superstitions. At least Adams and Goode are always watchable even when you occasionally feel embarrassed for them. Goode ( A Single Man ) suggests a dreamy young Jeremy Irons (he played the same role in the movie version of Brideshead Revisited ). He growls and shows his contempt for Annas fancy American ways by rolling his eyes and eating with his mouth open but his characters fundamental vulnerability is always discernible. Adams harrumphs pouts and tosses her hair while tottering around the luminous southwest of Ireland in bum-hugging skirts and stiletto heels. (If theres one thing you imagine super-competent young professional women would understand its how to dress for travel.) Though she always carries a childlike innocence that goes with her snub-nosed girlish features Adams is a real actress and there are flashes of her talent here moments when she shows her mercurial ability to change from despair to exuberance in a heartbeat. Here she seems to be working at about 2 per cent capacity but her performance is still the best 80 per cent of the picture.

Comments Leap Year Video Rated PG  100 minutes  2010 A materialistic Type-A career gal (Amy Adams) desperate to marry handsome but shallow cardiologist boyfriend (Adam Scott) is prompted by her doting dad (John Lithgow) to tail her young man to Cutesylvania--sorry Ireland--where a local folkway permits women to propose to men on February 29 every Leap Year. After bad weather knocks her off course shes forced to rely on a surly debt-ridden village barkeep (Matthew Goode) to get her to Dublin on time. They couldnt have less in common so naturally its only a matter of time before they fall in love. As modern rom-coms go this is trite but relatively painless; director Anand Tucker (Shopgirl Hilary and Jackie) should consider a career shooting travel brochures. PG 97 min.

Leap Year How many rom-coms can Ireland endure? | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentLeap Year How many rom-coms can Ireland endure?Faith and begorrah if it isnt that strange beastie the Loveblarney that comes thunderin over the green hillsAmy Adams plays an American yuppie who goes to Ireland to propose to her boyfriend but unexpectedly finds herself on a long and winding road to Dingle with a local barkeep played by Matthew Goode.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Jan. 8 2010 Starring Amy Adams Matthew Goode and Adam Scott. 100 minutes. Directed by Anand Tucker. At major theatres. PG Faith and begorrah if it isnt that strange beastie the Loveblarney that comes thunderin over the green hillsThe Loveblarney coinage 2010 is a furious feel-good movie hybrid of heart-tugging romantic comedy and rib-tickling Auld Sod hijinks of which Leap Year is a textbook example. Article Continued BelowThe term may be new but the trope isnt because theres nothing Hollywood likes better than setting an arrogant American loose upon the Emerald Isle for the purpose of being seduced and schooled by the sainted kissers of the Blarney Stone. Everyone from John Wayne (The Quiet Man) to Janeane Garofalo (The MatchMaker) has been won over by a Loveblarneys charms not to mention its commercial prospects.In Leap Year flame-haired Amy Adams is the uppity Yank in need of Loveblarney redemption. Shes Anna a Boston real estate decorator who does everything by the clock and the calculus. Shes been dating her cardiologist boyfriend Jeremy (Adam Scott) for four years and its time for him to romance the stone even if he doesnt know it - which he doesnt of course.When Jeremy callously gives Anna expensive diamond earrings rather than an engagement ring then announces hes off to Dublin for a convention of heart docs (how poetically cruel) whats a gal to do but follow him and pop the question herself even if he doesnt deserve her? You see Feb. 29 is coming up and it just happens to be Irish custom and also Annas family tradition that women can pop the question to a man on that magical extra day in a leap year.Take a closer look at that calendar Is this 2010 or 1950? It certainly seems the latter since no contemporary woman with an IQ above Guinness temperature would sit with such nonsense. Leap Year is a Loveblarney though so all liberated women will just have to keep their peace. They can take comfort in the fact theyre treated marginally better in this movie than are the Irish who just may be the last people on Earth who will tolerate such outrageous stereotyping. The film is so loaded with bright-eyed priests superstitious drunkards frisky scoundrels eccentric innkeepers and a gruff (but buff) barkeep its a wonder that someone doesnt file a class-action defamation lawsuit in the name of St. Patrick boyo. But that would be taking this bit of pre-Valentines Day frippery way too seriously and isnt the scenery gorgeous darlin? Especially when that gruff (but buff) barkeep is a dreamboat named Declan (Matthew Goode) who only treats women like peat moss because he had his heart broken by one you know?Declan and Anna end up on a long and winding road together after a series of comic (nay hilarious) misadventures lands Anna in Declans tiny village of Dingle rather than the big city of Dublin. She hops into his jalopy harrumphing while he grumps and they proceed to travel in the direction of a certain beating love muscle. (Yes this Loveblarney is also a road movie)Let it be said if nothing more can be that Adams is the woman you want for a picture like this. Following the Sandra Bullock model of savvy audience pandering shes able to smile through the heavy-handed direction of featherweight helmer Anand Tucker (Shopgirl) who would have made great travelogues during the Eisenhower years.Adams also pairs well with Goode and to give the movie its small due there are a few amusing twists to the tropes - including a smooch that will probably win Leap Year a nomination for Best Kiss at next years MTV Awards. But being in a Loveblarney is reward enough dont you think darlin?The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Amy Adams and Matthew Goode hate each other at first but something tells you that will change by the end. ABOUT THE MOVIELeap Year   (out of four) Stars Amy Adams Matthew Goode Adam Scott John LithgowDirector Anand TuckerDistributor Universal PicturesRating PG for sensuality and languageRunning time 1 hour 37 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Where it should be light and graceful Leap Year trips and thuds. Its a paint-by-numbers comedy predictable from the first frame to the ultra-corny ending. What saves it from being completely dismissible drivel are the gorgeous Irish locations and the charm of its stars Amy Adams and Matthew Goode. TRAILER See if youll put Leap Year on your calendar Adams plays Anna a Bostonian with a real estate job and a dull cardiologist boyfriend. She is fascinated by an Irish tradition in which women propose to their reluctant suitors on Leap Day Feb. 29. After four years with Jeremy (Adam Scott) Anna is itching for a diamond on her left hand. So she leaps aboard a plane to Dublin where her beau is attending a conference. Did we mention its just 48 hours from Leap Day? This is just the beginning of a series of events that will strain the credulity of even the mushiest romantic. For the first third of the movie Adams does her best to be irritating spoiled and clueless. But the actress is so intrinsically likable that its an uncomfortable fit. Anna is a contradiction who exists only in the reels of bad rom-com. Shes bratty uptight and self-absorbed but sweetly so. After a storm reroutes her to Wales Anna is hellbent to get to Dublin and propose to Jeremy. Planes are grounded no ferries are running but she finds a boatman who drops her off at a picturesque town on Irelands Dingle Peninsula. Tottering in 600 heels she stumbles into a pub. Behind the bar is the enigmatic Declan (Goode) who agrees to drive her to Dublin. But a host of catastrophes intervenes. Anna misses a train gets pelted by hail and rolls down a grassy hill into the muck. Scenes of her staggering around in inappropriate apparel are reminiscent of The Proposal and New in Town. Must romantic comedies depict all career woman as ill-equipped to survive anywhere but the big city? And must these women always endure humiliating slips and falls to land their men? A revolving door of one-note characters crops up all unfunny variations on an insulting theme. These well-meaning residents of rural Ireland are stereotyped as superstitious fools lovable sots or out-and-out buffoons. Its hard not to take umbrage for them no matter what your heritage. Control freak Anna and laidback Declan clash and bicker. Just in case we missed the depth of their animosity they frequently proclaim their hatred. So of course theyre destined for love. The suspense will not kill you Will Anna choose the dull doctor or the unpredictable Irishman from Dingle? Will she trade in her 600 shoes for a pair of muddy Wellingtons? Shocker of shockers Its Dingle all the way. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Reader Editor Brent Jones.

The mystery is how all these pluses add up to a minus experience.Amy Adams plays Anna an overwound Bostonian tired of waiting for Jeremy (Adam Scott) her cardiologist beau to propose. When he leaves for a conference in Dublin Anna decides to fly there to avail herself of the Irish quadrennial tradition of ""leap day."" On Feb. 29 women can pop the question. (As they can the other 365 days of the year.)In this heavily diluted version of those classics It Happened One Night and I Know Where Im Going on the way to wed Dream Man Anna gets sidetracked by Sarcastic Guy. And he really gets under her skin.In this case Sarcastic Guy is Declan (Matthew Goode the lanky charmer dumped by Scarlett Johansson in Match Point) a pub owner hired by Anna to escort her and her designer luggage to Dublin after her plane makes an emergency landing in Cork. Or is it Dingle?I like froth as much as the next girl and had parked my brain in the lobby in order to enjoy the ride.But as conceived by screenwriters Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont Anna is one of those strident superior professionals who gets knocked off her pedestal so that moviegoers can feel superior to her.Five minutes into the film I wanted to kick Anna and her five-inch heels to the curb. Five minutes after that I wanted to protect her from the filmmakers who knocked her down dragged her through mud and asked us to laugh at her klutziness and cluelessness. Am I alone in not finding her ritual humiliation at all funny?Moviegoers need to invest in a character in order to care about her. To its loss (and ours) Leap Year asks us to divest ourselves of Anna.Usually Amy Adams can work all kinds of magic with her wide-eyed gaze and wistful smile. But these attributes arent assets here they are distancing devices. As engaged as she was in Junebug Enchanted and Sunshine Cleaning thats how disconnected she is here. She doesnt phone in this performance she texts it.Faring only slightly better is Goode the sour to Adams sweet the realist puncturing Annas romantic bubbles. Goode is mordant loose-limbed and laid-back in the style of Rupert Everett and John Krasinski. But he could use a role where he has more than the two speeds of glam and glum.Director Anand Tucker (who made the fine chamber pieces Hilary and Jackie and Shopgirl) doesnt put much of a stamp on the material. He frames Adams and Goode amid picturesque scenery (beautifully shot by Thomas Newton Sigel). After a while they resemble nothing so much as garden gnomes on the heath.Yes there are moviegoers who will enjoy this formulaic treacle. You know who you are.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com. Read her blog ""Flickgrrl"" at http//www.philly.com/philly/blogs/flickgrrl/.

Its an old Irish custom you see and though Anna doesnt believe in luck and superstition the fact that Jeremy gave her earrings in lieu of the desired diamond is making her crazy. Anna is a bit of a control freak. So when her trip goes a little off-track thanks to a big ol Irish storm she ends up in a tiny village with no way to get to Dublin. Enter pub owner Declan (Matthew Goode) wholl ferry poor lost American-in-Ireland Anna to Dublin in exchange for 500 euros. Luckily hes strong-willed enough to match wits with her and so the pair embark on a trip that has all the trappings of a classic buddy movie constant sparring herds of cattle a bar fight or two ... and love? Maybe all of Annas best-laid plans will go wildly astray. Sound like the plot of a Nora Roberts paperback novel? Well ""Leap Year"" does veer into romance novel territory what with its sweeping scenery hunky leading man with an accent and independent fiery heroine. Its nothing you havent seen a hundred times before. Adams is much more successful as a fairy princess (""Enchanted"") than as a romantic comedy sweetheart although she tries her best to pull Anna out of one-dimensional career-girl stereotypes. (""Do you ever let your hair down?"" Declan wonders. Heres a spoiler She does.) Adams is just so darn likable and it works to her advantage. As for Goode hes endlessly charming has impeccable comic timing and can cock an eyebrow with the best of em. Though the endless series of pratfalls starts to wear thin halfway through he and Adams manage to coax out more than a few laughs. Youll figure out what happens in the end but at least its fairly fun to watch. The cinematography is what makes ""Leap Year"" worth seeing. Turns out Ireland is kind of pretty Its not all murky bogs and leprechauns you know. Think quaint cottages downtrodden castles and stunning cliffs perfect for making out upon. Do Anna and Declan oblige us? Im sure you can guess that for yourself.

The scenerys spectacular in the otherwise pedestrian ""Leap Year"" a romantic comedy about a Boston yuppie whose marital plans get waylaid during her impulsive jaunt to Ireland. Pic is pleasant enough overall if also somewhat gratingly old-fashioned; this is the kind of movie in which an uppity upper-crust woman requires rough-hewn working-class masculinity to take her down a peg or three. The box office draw of rising stars Amy Adams and Matthew Goode likely wont be strong enough to have auds leaping at the chance to see Universals Jan. 8 release. Anna (Adams) is a ""stager""  temporarily decorating apartments and houses on the real-estate market  whos dated workaholic cardiologist Jeremy (Adam Scott) for four years. Theyre serious enough to try buying into a very tony exclusive condo complex but Jeremy has been frustratingly slow to pop the question. When her latest hopes are dashed Anna takes action Shell turn up unannounced at a Dublin medical conference hes attending then propose herself on Feb. 29. According to Irish superstition and her own Irish-American clans lore (a hammy John Lithgow briefly appears as Annas hapless dad) thats the day every four years that lasses can ask for a lads hand. Charming tradition or act of desperation Anna no longer cares  she wants that ring. Unfortunately a violent storm forces her planes diversion to Wales where bad weather also cancels the usual passenger ferry options. Frantic about missing the lucky date Anna hitches a ride on a fishing trawler. But the elements thwart that plan too leaving her stranded in a dinky coastal hamlet on the Emerald Isles ""wrong"" side. When she meets Declan (Goode) proprietor of the areas only inn as well as its sole cabbie its dislike at first sight  particularly once Anna accidentally wrecks her room in the first of many labored slapstick interludes. But hes strapped for cash and cant turn down her offer of 500 for the drive to Dublin. Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfonts script is initially reminiscent of the Powell-Pressburger classic ""I Know Where Im Going""  whose upwardly mobile bride-to-be gets waylaid by weather and romance in a humble Scottish village  then channels ""It Happened One Night"" as a snippy snobby demanding heroine is forced to go on a road trip (and at one point pose as part of a married couple) with a rakish mans-man. But those movies were idiosyncratic and unpredictable whereas you know throughout just where this one is headed. Its refreshing when late twists briefly suggest the leads really wont end up together since nothing save romantic-comedy formula indicates theyre right for each other. Still convention must be served. Adams is surely one of the most appealing screen presences to emerge in recent years but her warmth can do only so much to redeem the roles condescending stereotype. Goode whos built an impressive dramatic resume (""A Single Man"" ""Brideshead Revisited"" ""Match Point"") reveals genuine comic spark here; still the material is beneath both performers. Likewise director Anand Tucker (""Shopgirl"" ""Hilary and Jackie"") who seldom descends to completely broad genre-alities but cant rise above the pics overall contrivance either. Nonetheless for auds seeking a formulaic date pic ""Leap Year"" might satisfactorily push the designated buttons. Certainly veteran d.p. Newton Thomas Sigels widescreen lensing will Irish tourism can expect a serious uptick from the pics ravishing postcard imagery. Other tech aspects are polished.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Its unclear what Amy Adams did to deserve ""Leap Year but all thats missing from the movie is a set of jailhouse bars over her scenes. She plays Anna one of those uptight over-prepared yuppies whose goals amount to engagement rings and real estate. Its not that she looks miserable - her eyes continue to pop with bliss and her voice retains its soothing lilt. But the snobbery blind determination and materialism she deploys are aggravating since they have nothing to do with the Amy Adams weve come to know. (This is the sort of movie where her Louis Vuitton rollerbag is called by its first name.)Anna goes to Ireland to propose to her fiance (Adam Scott) a Boston cardiologist in Dublin on business. Apparently its customary in Annas family for a woman to ask a man to marry her on Leap Day. (Well her grandmother did it.) That single inane conceit is surely what got this movie made - like owning 27 bridesmaids dresses or having a bride war. Leap Day is a gimmick to keep Anna whos stranded in an Irish hamlet because of a storm motivated to get to Dublin before Feb. 29 turns into March 1. Her sparring partner for the journey is Declan (Matthew Goode) the owner of a pub and inn. His assignment is to drive her in his beat-up Renault.The longtime team of Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan wrote this movie which Anand Tucker directed and theres neither a trace of believability nor a sense of legitimate fun in it. (Their collective output includes ""Josie and the Pussycats ""Shopgirl and ""Surviving Christmas.)Declan needs the money Annas paying him to keep his pub afloat. But the purely transactional nature of their relationship feels put on - they appear to be the only cute people in the entire country. They pretend to hate being around each other anyway. One night while faking being married to keep a room at a conservative inn they roll over in bed establish eye contact and then make a chagrined retreat to their respective sides of the bed. Just once Id like to see that scene end with a bed knocking a wall. ""Leap Year is nauseatingly chaste even by the sex-averse standards of recent romantic comedy.Weve had Adams as a star for only about two years but her persona seems firm Shes exceedingly tolerant. And while a movie can bend that tolerance in a hundred different directions very little can break it. In ""Leap Year Adams is required to be brittle and obnoxiously impatient. When shes shown a room in Declans shabby little inn she wrinkles her face and says ""Just like the Four Seasons.But like Sarah Jessica Parker in ""Did You Hear About the Morgans? Adams seems embarrassed by the confidence needed for a part like this. In the future these sorts of entitled yuppies will be played by Anna Kendrick of ""Up in the Air a woman who can be witheringly self-assured. Shes the 21st centurys answer to Rosalind Russell. When Kendrick wields a BlackBerry she means it.Until then theres Adams who doesnt own this characters sense of superiority. She apologizes for it. Of course given the material its hard to blame her.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation. (c) Copyright 2010 Globe Newspaper Company.

Share Tweet Winner of the Camera DOr for Best First Feature at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival the bracing Mexican psychodrama Leap Year unfolds almost entirely in a dim seedy one-room apartment that doubles as living space and state of mind. With equal debt owed to two mid-70s touchstones--half to Last Tango In Paris half to Jeanne Dielman 23 Quai Du Commerce 1080 Bruxelles--writer-director Michael Rowe patiently details the grinding routine of its 25-year-old occupant Monica del Carmen a freelance journalist by day and an insatiable nymphet by night. Adopting a long master-shot style similar to Mexicos reigning sex-and-death maestro Carlos Reygadas (Japon Battle In Heaven) Rowe follows del Carmen through dreary afternoons as she gathers quotes and dutifully clacks away on business articles like ""30 Tips To Beat The Recession."" Then at night she puts on low-cut dresses slathers herself in perfume and returns later with random men for sexual encounters that leave her feeling varying degrees of unsatisfied. All that changes when her latest partner the quiet inscrutable Gustavo Sanchez Parra ups the ante considerably An affair that begins with a little Samp;M grows more perverse and dangerous with each session and its not clear who if anyone is in control. Though the title and its significance suggest an answer Rowe wisely refrains from making it too explicit focusing instead on the fascinating evolution of del Carmen and Parras relationship. In the meantime Rowe parses out information about her younger brother her late father and her tenuous line of work that helps complete the puzzle. Never to be confused for the rom-com starring Amy Adams--though that would be the mother of all video-store mix-ups--Leap Year lets actions speak louder than words and the actions here are shockingly explicit. When del Carmen does get a monologue its an astonishing piece of writing and acting revealing a fantasy choked in sadness desire and a dwindling sense of self-worth. Rowe makes her psychology a little easier to unpack than it might be but Leap Year doesnt go where it appears to be heading and del Carmens wrenching performance is somehow both raw and completely mysterious. Shes an open question the film takes its time answering.

(Universal Pictures) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday January 7 2010 213 PM Title Leap Year What should Hollywood do with Amy Adams? As weve known since she earned an Oscar nod for ""Junebug"" theres nothing ordinary about her. But that makes her an especially ill fit for the bland big-studio roles actresses are so often pushed into. Weve seen her spark dampened before (most recently in ""Julie amp; Julia"") but never as depressingly as in Anand Tuckers ""Leap Year.""Though a loose update of 1945s ""I Know Where Im Going"" the soulless script patches together influences ranging from 1934s ""It Happened One Night"" to 1997s ""The Matchmaker"" which was also about an ambitious American who falls for a surly Irishman. While the latter was equally uninspired lead Janeane Garofalo stubbornly refused to dim her own intelligence and elevated a mediocre movie in the process.Adams alas is not so fortunate. Always eager to please she fits so perfectly into her surroundings that she disappears becoming just another beautiful face in just another disposable rom-com.The retrograde plot finds her prim Anna eager for a proposal from stuffy boyfriend Jeremy (Adam Scott). Since its apparently never occurred to her to simply raise the subject of marriage shes thrilled to hear about an Irish tradition Once every four years on Feb. 29 women can -- gasp -- propose to men. Conveniently Jeremy has a conference in Dublin the last week of February so she jumps on a plane to surprise him. Naturally her plans go awry and she winds up in one of those quirky little villages filmmakers love so much. Ill-tempered pub owner Declan (Matthew Goode) reluctantly agrees to drive her to Dublin and soon enough these bickering opposites -- wait for it -- start to attract. On the plus side the Irish landscape is gorgeous and Scott and John Lithgow are amusing in small roles. But Goode barely makes an effort so Adams frantic exertions feel especially disheartening. And since Hollywood loves to humiliate its heroines these days shes forced to teeter through cow pastures in high heels fall face-first in mud and listen to sexist insults over and over. She deserves better and so do we.

"Leap Year | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; leap-year ) Leap Year (United States/Ireland 2010) January 06 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Often when a romantic comedy fails its because of the lack of chemistry between the leads. In the case of Leap Year the problem isnt the absence of chemistry but the presence of too much of the wrong kind. The sense of cold antagonism that initially develops between the primary characters is so strong that it lingers throughout. With an ""oil and water"" formula in which the leads are expected to start out sparring and end up kissing this might not be a bad thing except it runs too deep and lasts too long. By the time the lovers are going through the motions of succumbing to Cupid theres neither heat nor passion. We believe the dislike at the onset but not the romance at the payoff. And thats a major flaw. Anna (Amy Adams) is a flighty social climber. Shes more interested in nabbing a coveted available spot in a high-end condominium community that she is in finding true love. Still shes hoping for marriage so when her long-term boyfriend Jeremy (Adam Scott) presents her with a gift of twin diamond stud earrings instead of something she can wear on her finger shes crushed. Before they can discuss it however Jeremy is off to Ireland for a doctors conference. Acting on advice from her father (John Lithgow) Anna follows him. It seems theres an old myth that decrees on Leap Day a woman in Ireland can propose to a man. With February 29 fast approaching she books her flight and prepares to pop the question. Unfortunately bad weather intervenes and Anna ends up in a small Irish town considerably distant from her goal of Dublin. A local pub owner/taxi driver Declan (Matthew Goode) offers to come to her rescue for the right price. Thus begins a road trip where the two begin to fall under each others spell as they trade verbal jabs. Amy Adams is normally likeable but Anna comes across as a perfect storm of shallowness and stupidity. Shes annoying and cartoonish. Thats bearable in comparison with Matthew Goodes Declan however whos a complete asshole. As they embark upon their road trip a local remarks that theyll kill each other. Would that we could be so lucky... Had they died early in the journey we would have been spared the final 45 minutes. Of course they fall for each other in the end. Thats the formula and director Anand Tucker has no interest in disappointing his core audience but I didnt believe for a moment that these two as presented could bridge their despite to find a place of peaceful coexistence (much less amour). If there was to be a sequel (as unlikely a proposition as one can imagine) the supporting characters would be divorce lawyers. As a travelogue of rural Ireland Leap Year isnt half-bad although it tends to reinforce certain stereotypes about mud rain and rampant superstition. This is the Ireland one expects to see in a movie where the old men all talk and look a little like leprechauns and the women are motherly and full of good advice. The film gets some mileage from the fish-out-of-water aspect of Annas story but like most of the elements in Leap Year it doesnt quite work. The scene in which she practically wrecks a small hotel room trying to plug in her blackberry is more cringe-inducing than funny. The early January release date is indicative of the studios tepid expectations for the film; it didnt even merit a Valentines Day opening. If theres one thing to be said in Leap Years favor its that at least the characters spend most of the film in each others company rather than separated by contrivances (a situation that would force them to fall in love after exchanging about two lines of dialogue). In theory this approach should allow a bond to develop. The problem is whatever romantic seed germinates is kept hidden from the audience. So as in too many movies of this sort we are forced to accept the liaison for no reason more compelling than that the screenplay tells us its the case not because any credible evidence has been presented. Its sort of like the parental explanation of ""Because I said so."" With the on-screen evidence of compelling affection so niggardly it makes for an unappealing and disappointing love affair.

Leap Year Bad to fair Director Anand Tucker. Cast Amy Adams Matthew Goode Adam Scott. Rating PG for sensuality and language. RELATED Amy Adams to rest after Leap Year Movies to ignite your wanderlust Spotlight Amy Adams Whats she doing in this? This being ""Leap Year"" a by-the-numbers romantic comedy as predictable as it is cloying. It plays like a remake of a classic-rock tune thats already been done to death; whatever surprises might be found - and youve got to look awfully hard to find any - are attributable solely to the artists performance. In this case that means Adams and Matthew Goode. He too is a fine talent the sort of actor more recently found in films like ""Brideshead Revisited"" and ""A Single Man."" In lesser hands ""Leap Year"" would be dreadful indeed. In theirs its not that much better. Anna (Adams) is a stereotypically overly organized woman the type who wipes down the edge of the counter when sipping wine at a bar. Her boyfriend Jeremy (Adam Scott) is an overworked cardiologist. They live by BlackBerry scheduling. When Jeremy travels to Dublin Ireland for a convention Anna decides to tag along later and in an Irish tradition surprise him by proposing marriage on Feb. 29 - Leap Day. Which might have been a better title who knows. Fate intervenes of course; if it hadnt Goode never would have shown up. Bad weather lands Anna in Dingle a tiny town where she is forced to spend the night in a pub and hotel owned by Declan played by Goode. Shes desperate to get to Dublin hes desperate for money so despite an innate dislike for one another - hes as laid back as she is uptight - they embark on a road trip. Google maps puts the trip from Dingle to Dublin at about four and a half hours by car. You could walk it in two days. But such a straightforward journey wouldnt allow for visits to romantic castle ruins or overnight stays in quaint bed-and-breakfasts that require not only that Anna and Declan pretend to be married but to kiss in front of the other guests at dinner as well. Is there any question that what we think will happen does indeed happen? Of course not. Its just a matter of getting there and ""Leap Year"" eventually does arrive at its preordained conclusion with a few detours through some beautiful Irish countryside and hackneyed storytelling devices - including stumbling onto a wedding in progress - along the way. Even with Adams and Goode its hardly worth the trip. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Twitter goodyk.

In a movie like It Happened One Night (1934) Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert gave such good antagonism that you just knew they were meant to be together. The bickering wasnt petty; it was proof that they had the sparky toughness -- the ego -- for love. In Leap Year Amy Adams plays Anna a real estate exhibitor who chases her mealy cardiologist boyfriend (Adam Scott) all the way to Ireland to propose to him on leap-year day (an old Irish custom). Matthew Goode is Declan the tall faraway-eyed scruffy-dreamboat Irish bartender who for 500 euros agrees to shepherd Anna to Dublin. The two spend the movie roving through the countryside from pubs to inns to old castles to crashed weddings working their way through various levels of annoyance class warfare and petulant erotic tension. The director Anand Tucker (Shopgirl) leaves things relatively uncluttered which I appreciated. At the same time I could have put that less generously -- as in not very much surprising happens. Tucker keeps the emerald travelogue images crisp and clean and the emotions modest so that the entire movie hinges more or less on the charming/ cantankerous love-hate tangles of its dueling stars. If the young Ann-Margret had been allowed to wiggle her brain as much as her bod she might have come off something like Amy Adams. Is there an actress today who can suffuse a single scene with so many infectious mood swings? As Anna shes fiery and vulnerable wistful and exuberant; she lends a rare dignity to the portrayal of a woman who doesnt know what she wants. Anna believes shes going to sweep herself into happiness with her leap-year proposal but Declan sees her grand folly and also her designer-luggage pretensions. Goode a deft but recessive actor (hes Colin Firths lover-in-flashback in A Single Man) is an expert at soft-pedaled contempt. As Declan lets his guard down though the films appealing tart-tongued fluffiness starts to flatten out. Leap Year could have used more pizzazz. Yet youre never in doubt that these two like each ? other -- or just as important that they dont.

"Movie Review Leap Year needs more of a skip in its step - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Adam Scott Movie Review Leap Year needs more of a skip in its stepJanuary 7 2010|By Roger Moore Orlando Sentinel Movie Critic If chemistry were all then the sparks Amy Adams and Matthew Goode set off would be enough in Leap Year a romantic comedy in which those sparks never quite ignite. She plays Anna an over-organized real-estate ""stager"" that person who comes in before an open house puts out flowers and bakes cookies all to trick prospective buyers into thinking theyre ""home."" She and long-term beau Jeremy (Adam Scott) the cardiologist have a shot at getting into Bostons exclusive ""Davenport"" luxury apartment building. What they dont have is a date -- for a wedding or even plans for a date. Four years in and workaholic boyfriend cant pull the trigger on this ""convenient"" romance. But when he is off to a conference in Dublin her dad ( John Lithgow) reminds her of the Irish tradition that grandma used to snare grandpa. On leap day in a leap year the ladies in Ireland get to do the proposing. Anna leaps on a plane to go and close the deal. ""Im on a schedule"" she snaps when weather re-directs her to Wales. But her dangerous crossing of the Irish Sea isnt the worst of it. Once she shows up in Dingle the only person who can get her to Dublin in time is the cynical financially strapped pub owner Declan (Goode) who isnt keen to go to ""a city of chancers and cheats."" But he does. Will mishap-prone Anna get them killed? Will she ever get past his nickname for her (""EEED-jut"") and see his charm? Anand Tucker (Shopgirl) is not the first or fourth name that comes to mind when youre looking for a romantic comedy director. He gives us a generous selection of heart-melting Adams close-ups. But his touch is heavy-handed the pacing is sluggish and he doesnt know how to use the locations for warmth or how to cast the standard issue Irish bit players for ""local color."" Romantic comedies should sparkle. Tucker doesnt do ""sparkle."" The Made of Honor screenwriters dont deliver enough jokes or feisty exchanges between the ill-matched traveling companions. The PG rating robs the picture of that well-placed curse that lets us laugh at the obstacles to love the couple encounter on their quest. Its a romantic comedy. We know where this is going. Tucker amp; Co. dont seem to realize that its not the destination its the witty winsome journey that counts.

The woman in Leap Year is Anna (Amy Adams) a Boston apartment stager and her intended fiance Jeremy (Adam Scott) is a surgeon more in love with his BlackBerry than her. But after four years he still hasnt pulled the Tiffany trigger. Whats a girl to do? Jeremy has flown to a medical conference in Dublin which neatly coincides with leap day so Anna follows--intending to ambush him on the fated date. Needless to say things dont go as planned. Leap Year belongs to the Prada backlash subgenre of womens pictures--epitomized by The Proposal--in which smart stylish women must be muddied abased ridiculed and degraded in order to get their man. Only the new man is waggish innkeeper Declan (Matthew Goode) who agrees to drive stranded Anna to Dublin. Shes uptight and hyper-organized; hes a grinning oaf who chews with his mouth open. See where this is going? Adams and Goode are both appealing but you can write Leap Years opposites-attract itinerary yourself. Written by Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan (Made of Honor) and directed by Anand Tucker (Shopgirl) the movie seems a rehash of 1930s conventions--It Happened One Night in Ireland. (Oh no Theres only one bed left at the Bamp;B) Free from sex or naughty language Leap Year appears to have been designed for that huge mother-daughter matinee market ahem.
