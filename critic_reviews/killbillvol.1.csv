Film is a densely textured work that gets better as it goes along and is at heart a loving recapitulation of 70s-era chop-socky. A cottage industry of film studies theses will no doubt result from pic. ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" represents a hypertalented American film geeks fever dream of complete immersion in the world of Asian martial arts pictures. A strange fun and densely textured work that gets better as it goes along this ""4th film by Quentin Tarantino"" as the opening credits forthrightly put it is actually the first half of what was originally intended as a single film Vol. 2 of which is now set to open on Feb. 20 of next year. It remains to be seen what mainstream Yank audiences will make of an American film that is perhaps half in Japanese and is at heart a loving recapitulation of 70s-era chop-socky highlights. But Tarantinos large following which has been waiting six years for a follow-up to ""Jackie Brown"" and the spectacular action sequences should generate flashy B.O. numbers for Miramax and even better results overseas. Producers will double their pleasure in the DVD market with the initial release of ""Vol. 1"" followed by the ultimate double set of the complete feature down the line. A cottage industry of film studies theses will no doubt result from ""Kill Bill;"" so entirely is it comprised of elements of previous movies that its virtually a great-looking Frankenstein monster among motion pictures. Tarantinos overriding inspiration-Hong Kong kung fu actioners that largely showed at grind houses in the U.S.-is announced by the first image to hit the screen a vintage logo for the ""Shaw Scope"" widescreen process from the Shaw Brothers studios. Eventually innumerable references come into play spaghetti Westerns yakuza dramas Japanese and American TV shows anime pop music and female revenge yarns spanning everything from ""The Bride Wore Black"" to ""Ms. 45."" Watching the film is like mainlining Tarantinos favorite chosen cinematic moments reshaped by the writer-director as a sort of reverie of adolescent enthusiasms. Few filmmakers have ever had the freedom and resources to make such a piece exactly as they wished and Tarantino takes it so far that it becomes a highly idiosyncratic and deeply personal excursion into a world of movie-inspired unreality. To the extent that it stems from an early love of martial arts cinema ""Kill Bill"" at this half-way mark at least can be seen as a sort of pulpy populist companion piece to Zhang Yimous refined take on the genre ""Hero;"" both are consummately aesthetisized recapitulations of oft-told tales but while Zhang took the pristine high road Tarantino resolutely takes the down-and-dirty low road. Framed by two proverbs-""Revenge is a dish best served cold"" and ""Revenge is never a straight line""-""Kill Bill"" actually does walk a pretty straight path especially for a Tarantino film. Told in five labeled chapters from ""The Blood-Spattered Bride"" to ""Showdown at the House of Blue Leaves"" pic elaborates the tale of a woman whose rural El Paso wedding ceremony is invaded by The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad and who returns from near-death four years later to individually track down those responsible. Unfortunately Tarantinos attempt to get things off to a kick-ass start with Uma Thurmans Bride busting into the Pasadena home of one of her attackers (Vivica A. Fox) to initiate a prolonged and bloody fight-to-the-death does just the opposite; scenes over-the-top violence and tough-babe attitudes come on too strong right out of the box before viewers can get their bearings. Somewhat awkward sequence creates an off-puttingly unsettling feeling in that the gruesome results are witnessed by the dead womans little daughter to whom the Bride speaks in callously adult terms. Its doubtful that anyone who had ever had kids could write a scene quite like this. Partly as a result it takes a while for the film to get on track; in fact its easy to see how had Tarantino needed to compress ""Kill Bill"" into one feature the events of the first 35 minutes could have squeezed into half that time. A long weird and questionable interlude is devoted the Brides comatose stay in hospital her near-rape arranged by an orderly who pimps for unconscious patients and her eventual escape. Oddly its an anime sequence that puts things right. The Brides second target is O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) the queen of the Tokyo underworld whose backstory of having witnessed as a child the brutal killing of her gangster father by yakuza thugs and of eventually extracting her own revenge is told entirely in a 7-minute anime specially created under Tarantinos direction by the Japanese studio Production I.G. Inspired device is strongly effective and serves as a wonderful bridge for the action from the U.S. to Asia. First stop on the Brides long road to her destiny is Okinawa for a little blade shopping at the modest sushi bar of Hattori Hanzo (70s martial arts superstar Sonny Chiba) the name of the ninja assassin Chiba played on Japanese TV series ""Shadow Warriors."" After some genial broad comedy that shifts the films dialogue primarily to Japanese the long-retired warrior agrees to make a special samurai sword for the Bride who then makes her way to Tokyo (her sword right by her side in the wonderfully artificial plane) for her battle royal with O-Ren Ishii whose takeover of the local crime scene is dramatized in an outrageous board room sequence. Pics giant set piece which reportedly took eight weeks to shoot takes place in a nightclub where the Brides disruptive arrival prompts a fierce fight with lethal school-uniformed hit girl Gogo (""Battle Royale"" star Chiaki Kuriyama) whose weapon of choice is a blade-adorned ball and chain inspired by Tarantino fave ""Master of the Flying Guillotine."" Thereafter O-Ren Ishii summons seemingly dozens of sword-wielding black-suited-and-masked samurai to try to finish off the Bride. As in a martial arts wet dream the yellow jump-suited Bride hacks thrusts whirls spins cartwheels jumps bends and slides around the premises as she lays waste to this grunting and groaning crew. For this dazzlingly prolonged sequence which employs extensive wire stunts but no CGI the color bleeds into black-and-white presumably as was the case with ""Taxi Driver"" and its desaturated climactic bloodbath to avoid MPAA ratings problems. But whatever grisliness is skirted visually is more than made up for by the accentuated sound effects which are amazing throughout. After all this overwhelming mayhem the climactic action settles down to a highly focused mano a mano between the Bride and the white-robed O-Ren Ishii. Played out in the classical setting of a formal Japanese garden on a night graced by light snowfall this fight which is shot in carefully framed compositions has the concentration and precision of a chess match and reps a satisfying conclusion to ""Vol. 1"" even if it only marks the half-way point in the overall story. Postscript teaser material promises a return to the American Southwest to track down the Brides three remaining nemeses eye-patched hit woman Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) here present in the hospital sequence; the little-glimpsed Budd (Michael Madsen); and inevitably the title character whose face is never seen in ""Vol. 1"" although David Carradines hands are seen and voice is heard. Press notes supplied for the first installment actually reveal significant plot points for both films and in them Tarantino promises that ""Vol. 2"" will take a strongly dramatic turn into spaghetti Western territory something hinted at here by the preponderance of ""found"" Italian Western music by Morricone and others on the soundtrack. Brutalized and bloodied in nearly every scene of the picture Thurman looks as though she were really put through the wringer here in what might have been the most physically arduous female role since Sigourney Weaver battled the ""Alien."" Like the picture itself Thurman really comes into her own once the story settles in Asia where she generates good fun with Chiba and ferocious adversarial techniques opposite her innumerable enemies. Having had to learn swordsmanship as well as Japanese dialogue delivery well enough to hold her own among native thesps Thurman cuts so to speak a terrific figure. Well known for renewing the careers of faded favorites (John Travotla Pam Grier Robert Forster et al.) Tarantino appears above all to have done similar favors here to Chiba whose old pictures will undoubtedly come into heavy new demand as a result of his enjoyable perf. Liu registers much more impressively here than in the ""Charlies Angels"" opuses while the most intriguing discovery is Julie Dreyfus a beautiful French actress with a long career in Japan who makes quite an impression as O-Ren Ishiis right arm and thanks to the Bride eventually one-armed colleague. Beautifully made picture is immeasurably boosted by Sally Menkes exceedingly dynamic and fluid editing which cuts on the action in the big scenes while establishing a gradually accelerating pace to the film overall and Robert Richardsons deeply inventive cinematography which pays homage to established genre styles while developing different looks for the individual chapters. Production design by Yohei Tanada (for the Asian section) and David Wasco and costumes by Kumiko Ogawa and Catherine Marie Thomas are uniformly striking. As usual for Tarantino soundtrack is key with source music sometimes familiar other times not pop tunes and original compositions by The RZA (Robert Diggs producer of The Wu-Tang Clan) often setting the tone for scenes. In the end much speculation will probably swirl around whether or not ""Kill Bill"" represents a case of arrested development and adolescent fixations elaborated to an astonishing degree of pop culture esoterica transported into the realm of Event by virtue of one filmmakers intense obsessions. Some viewers will also miss the snap and color of Tarantinos trademark dialogue which reportedly asserts itself more in the second half. All the same the picture displays the confidence nerve and wild imagination that marked the filmmakers earlier work along with increased visual savvy. Most importantly at the end youre up to see what happens in ""Vol. 2."" Kill Bill Vol. 1ProductionA Miramax release of A Band Apart production. Produced by Lawrence Bender Quentin Tarantino.

"The Killer Bride washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living >> Follow Style On Movies The Killer Bride Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday October 10 2003 Will all the good little boys and girls raise their hands please? Thank you. Susie -- by the way Susie that was a wonderful decoupage you made illustrating the Ten Commandments -- Susie why dont you get a piece of cake in the kitchen? And David -- congratulations on making Eagle Scout -- David you run along with Susie. Bye kids. Ah. Now for the rest of you lizardheads geeks mutants; twisted pimpled dwarves; dead-eyed beleathered spiked freaks boy have I got a movie for you. The movie would be ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" and man is it cool. If any civilized humans are left in the room let me point out I didnt say ""good"" much less ""superb"" or ""great."" Let someone else decide that or laugh at the inquiry two decades down the road. For now ""Kill Bill"" Quentin Tarantinos first film in six years is pure evil bliss. Its not pulp fiction; its pulped fiction a crazed phantasmagoria of high craft low taste and middlebrow swordplay. And by middlebrow I refer to the whizz of a multifolded samurai blade as it cleaves the skull and leaves the brow on the floor. That kind of middlebrow. Uma meet 150 Japanese guys with swords. Guys meet Uma. Now Uma kill them. Uma very good. Why you got all 150 of them Thats one of the thrills of ""Kill Bill"" watching the willowy fetching Uma Thurman turn into a sword-slinging Tilt-a-Whirl that spatters scythes slashes lops and dices everything in its path. Im surprised they didnt lose a few cameramen on the shoot. The thing is about as refined as watching someone feed hot dogs into a Cuisinart set on 10 except that its delivered with such high panache and brio its mesmerizing. ""Kill Bill"" is the story of the brides revenge though ""story"" is not quite the word. Its an ideogram of vengeance a rebus of revenge. Its not narrative; its graffiti. The bad guys kill the brides family. They think they kill the bride. They kill her unborn child. They kill her husband-to-be. All this happens on her wedding day in the chapel where shes wearing her bridal gown. Four years later she awakens from a coma. First she must dispatch in most grisly fashion a necrophiliac happily engaging her thought-to-be-still form. Having taken care of that little detail (why the look on the fellows face is positively amazing) she escapes from the hospital. Then she tracks down the evildoers and kills them. In fact the movie runs out of time before she runs out of people to kill so you will have to wait for what they are calling ""Vol. 2"" in February to see her whack the last. At one point -- the movie is hazy on time as it flits forward and backward in chronology in accordance with postmodernist mandates on the arbitrariness of narrative -- every major figure was a member of something called the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad under the command of one Bill (whose face we never see though credits reveal him to be David Carradine). Is this outfit public sector or private? Listed on the New York Stock Exchange? Term of enlistment? All of that information is unavailable. What is available is that for reasons unspecified it has been determined that Uma must be purged from the outfit -- production notes suggest that her pregnancy prompted her to try to quit which is frowned upon -- and so the here-comes-the-bullet-into-the-brides-head atrocity is engineered. Its hideous reality keeps flashing back into her mind as she tracks down former colleagues for her little chats. And how could there be any further explanation for the carnage onscreen? It would just sound silly. What would possibly be the justification in the real world for an elite assassination team staffed by gorgeous women that appears to work solely with samurai swords (though Bill does carry a Colt Peacemaker) and is bound up somehow in the rules and rituals of Bushido? Tarantino has stripped the story to its rawest most functional element Only motive and opportunity are chronicled and nothing is related to any kind of wider context. It is pure outlaw art caring not a whit what anybody thinks of it. And playing by no known rules. At one point ""Kill Bill"" suddenly becomes a cartoon -- literally. When it comes time for the bride to close in on the assassin O-Ren Ishi (""Uma O-Ren."" ""O-Ren Uma"") the film diverts to vivid Japanese animation for a good 20 minutes as O-Rens bloody history is portrayed. Its not a pretty story involving her own set of slaughtered parents her own revenge her swift ascent through the Tokyo underworld. Ultimately the animated O-Ren de-morphs into Lucy Liu in time for an epic climactic battle in the snow with Uma. The collection of fetishes on display is pretty amazing surely the most intense this side of Krafft-Ebbings ""Psychopathia Sexualis."" Tarantino has a major thing for feet especially Thurmans which nearly get more screen time than her face does. He loves tart mood changes as when a child walks in on a knife fight and the opponents (Thurman and Vivica A. Fox) immediately hide their blades and make nice for the child like suburban bridge club members. When she goes upstairs its back to slash and thrust building to something I know Ive never seen before the gun in the cereal box (POW Capn Crunch everywhere) And lets not mince the truth here Tarantino is also ghoulishly attracted to the realities of bladed battle which include limb removal massive arterial spray piercings at all unusual angles and ultimately lakes of blood. All this stuff is weirdly sexualized; we are in a very different part of the forest. Can you imagine what it would do to Susie and David to see such a spectacle? So all Susies and all Davids of whatever age Do not enter. Do not pass the theater where its playing. Dont even live in the same county where its playing. As for the rest of you fiends pay no attention to that guy on the aisle 15 rows up. Thats me and I do not want to be disturbed. Kill Bill Vol. 1 (93 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for extreme gore including stabbings beatings shootings dismemberments and amputations. Bad language too.

Uma Thurman stars in Kill Bill. Yet history tells us that some accomplished movies end up being dismissed or loathed by many and not all of these naysayers are stupid. At times you believe Bills primary motive is to prove this axiom. More about the movie Kill Bill -- Vol. 1    1/2 (out of four) Stars Uma Thurman Lucy Liu Vivica A. Fox Michael Madsen Daryl Hannah Sonny Chiba Director Quentin Tarantino Distributor Miramax Rating Rated R for strong bloody violence language and some sexual content. Opens today nationwide Tarantinos first feature since 1997s Jackie Brown is a sometimes uproariously authoritative homage to Asian action ""chop-socky"" pics of the 70s. It even casts one of the genres top stars Sonny Chiba in a key role. If this doesnt make it a specialized major release the fact that Bill is the most violent movie in memory not to carry an NC-17 rating does. That said the violence in this almost promiscuously elaborate revenge piece is comic and stylized as fabulous Uma Thurman embarks on a mission to avenge all parties in a conspiracy that slaughtered her Texas wedding party and unborn child and left her for dead. (Related item See Quentin Tarantino talk about making Kill Bill Vol. 1) First up is Vivica A. Fox. From Thurmans first blow you know that Fox will need a pro house cleaner if not a casket. Then anything goes an ugly hospital rape a long anime sequence and an encounter with samurai sword designer Chiba that threatens to make Bill the first Tarantino feature to drag a bit. But any impatience vanishes during the extended climactic carnage that pits Thurman vs. a Tokyo yakuza queen (Lucy Liu) and her killer flunkies an action masterpiece and the movie show-stopper of the year. Bill re-establishes that Tarantino ranks with Boogie Nights Paul Thomas Anderson as one of the few Hollywood filmmakers of the past 25 years with the stuff to win a lifetime achievement award. Like Hitchcock and few others Tarantino can glean excitement out of someone walking across a room. And hes funny. To those on his wavelength he gets two chuckles during the opening credits. There is however something a tad deflating about seeing a major filmmakers first feature in six years be such a lark. Kill Bill Vol. 2 arrives in February. And though well know better then how good Vol. 1 is another movie axiom says that style always stands the test of time. Whatever Bills limitations style isnt one of them.

Starring Uma Thurman and Lucy Liu. Directed by Quentin Tarantino. (R. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Technically you shouldnt believe any review of Quentin Tarantinos ""Kill Bill Volume 1"" that youve read so far because the film worlds auteur du jour decided just this week to make last-minute tweaks in the film coming out today. He didnt finish tweaking until Thursday. On the other hand it would take more than a few days and a few tweaks to turn this mess into a cohesive product. To be fair Tarantino never asked anybody to take him seriously. But critics did anyway and set him up for the fall that he is about to take with ""Kill Bill Volume 1"" a 90-minute orgy of endless sword fights multiple severed limbs and gushing blood. It boggles the mind that after six years of silence all Tarantino has to offer is this garbage. I say this with no glee. There was a time when Tarantino seemed like the most promising filmmaker of his generation. And of course he still has talent. He has flair. He knows where to place a camera and how to maximize tension and take moments to the extreme. But with ""Kill Bill"" we realize that his flash and panache are in the service of absolute emptiness. This puerile ugly fantasy is the sad but unmistakable product of a consciousness not worthy of serious attention. In fairness since no critic including myself saw the final version of the film Ill go back for a second viewing after the movie opens. The film -- really half a film -- takes its inspiration from the kung fu movies of the 70s and the Japanese and Hong Kong action extravaganzas of the 80s and 90s. Perhaps that in itself should serve as a clue. Tarantinos inspiration is coming secondhand not from life but from fantasy and from other peoples fantasies to boot. Once it was possible to assume that Tarantinos pop culture references were an ironic critique on the barrenness of media-age culture but theres no mistaking it now Tarantinos work is not a commentary on the barrenness. It is the barrenness. Yet all would be forgiven if he at least turned in a decent kung fu movie. He doesnt. Instead of something kinetic and fast-paced we get a ponderous wallow in gore. Originally conceived as one movie ""Kill Bill"" is being released as two films but ""Volume 1"" does not play like a discrete entity. Scenes are allowed to go on forever as if to stretch this installment to feature length. And then it doesnt really end; it just stops. At least it does stop. Uma Thurmans blood-covered face fills the screen in the movies first shot. She plays the Bride an elite assassin whose wedding has been interrupted by her former associates. Theyve come and killed all her guests and now her former boss Bill (David Carradine) is there off camera to finish her off. As he shoots her in the head the screen goes black. Its a disturbing opening but its also arresting. At this point theres still hope. ""Kill Bill Volume 1"" is essentially a revenge saga. The Bride wakes up after a four-year coma and just as soon as she can get her atrophied legs moving she starts working her way down a list killing people. In that way the movie is like ""A Chorus Line"" The story doesnt move forward but sideways with each character getting a turn. When the Bride shows up at the door of one enemy (Vivica A. Fox) the camera as in an Asian action film moves in for a pair of ominous close-ups as the soundtrack blares. Its an amusing touch until we realize that Tarantino isnt making a parody but a bloated American tribute. The 70s- sounding soundtrack is cranked just into the zone of distortion to replicate how it might have sounded in a small empty theater 30 years ago. Its an authentic touch but its also 90 minutes of very loud very bad music. The movie is full of similar indulgences including a tedious sequence about the making of a sword and even worse a dull expository sequence in which we find out how an American-born woman Cottonmouth (Lucy Liu) became head of a Japanese crime syndicate. Its rendered as a Japanese anime with lots of cartoon blood. Mainly though the movie is about combat -- with scenes of Thurman kicking with her long legs and holding a sword with two hands as the bodies pile up in a circle around her. Heads arms and legs are cut off and the blood gushes as from a shower. These dismemberments are not isolated incidents but the substance of the film a blood-running motif. The centerpiece is a ridiculously overlong and grotesque scene in which the Bride in pursuit of Cottonmouth kills and dismembers scores maybe hundreds of people. The scene must go on for 30 minutes. It feels even longer. As the body count mounts and the blood soaks the floor ""Kill Bill"" gradually begins to seem like a deeply neurotic expression hiding behind a screen of genre convention. Among Tarantinos many women with swords we get Go Go (Chiaki Kuriyama) a 17-year-old in a Catholic school uniform who is Cottonmouths lethal bodyguard. Whose delicious fantasy is this? And when steel nails penetrate her brain and her eyes fill with blood is that supposed to be funny? Or cool? Or arousing? Lets just call it pornography. And lets just admit its indefensible. - This film contains strong language sexual situations and violence.

(CNN) -- Writer-director Quentin Tarantino is back with a vengeance with his brilliant blood-splattered revenge flick ""Kill Bill Vol. I."" Tarantino may be many things but he is most definitely not your average moviemaker. Hes a film historian and avid movie fan and he lives and breathes his projects. ""Kill Bill"" is an homage to Tarantinos beloved spaghetti westerns Chinese martial arts films and Japanese samurai movies as well as the Japanese animation known as anime. The film was crafted in different chapters and each reflects the characteristics of these different genres filtered through the highly unique sensibilities of Tarantinos avant-garde style. The basic premise involves a sinister man simply known as Bill (played by one of Tarantinos boyhood heroes David Carradine of the 1970s TV show ""Kung Fu"") whos formed an elite group of mostly female assassins known as the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad or DIVAS -- a typical Tarantino touch. All the Vipers have code names and the most dangerous of the gang is Black Mamba played by Tarantinos main muse Uma Thurman. Shot down getting up Black Mamba who at one point was Bills lover attempts to leave her life of murder and mayhem behind (retiring is apparently not an option) and get married in a small church in Mexico. Pregnant at the time she is shot down -- along with the rest of the wedding party -- by her fellow DIVAS who have left her for dead. Members of the DIVAS -- Daryl Hannah Vivica A. Fox Michael Madsen and Lucy Liu -- cause mayhem wherever they go. However Black Mamba hereafter known simply as ""The Bride"" has actually fallen into a deep coma. When she awakens four years later in a strange hospital well ... shes in for some very nasty surprises devised from the strange mind of the films creator. Barely escaping she flees in a most unusual vehicle and sets out to seek revenge against the rest of the vipers and most especially Bill himself. But Bill -- barely seen in this first film -- will have to wait for ""Volume II."" In the meantime The Bride takes care of many many others. Tarantino won an Oscar for best screenplay for co-writing 1994s ""Pulp Fiction"" with then writing partner Roger Avary. The two had a bitter break over credit for the film and many have wondered over the years if Tarantinos long delays between projects was due to his fear of not being able to follow that magnificent success. Since then the filmmakers only movie has been 1997s ""Jackie Brown"" which earned mixed reviews. ""Kill Bill"" is Tarantinos fourth movie. With it any concerns about Tarantinos filmmaking chops can now be put to rest. Great work Daryl Hannah goes to the hospital to take care of Uma Thurman in ""Kill Bill."" This film is also Thurmans best work since ""Pulp Fiction"" and her fellow assassins -- Lucy Liu Daryl Hannah and Vivica A. Fox -- also turn in outstanding performances. One amazing action scene between Thurman and Liu lasts 20 minutes and took weeks to shoot. The violence blood levels -- and just plain cheesy gore -- in this film are extreme but Tarantinos sharp dialogue and expert editing leaves you breathless. In the hands of a lesser filmmaker the reaction could have been gagging. ""Kill Bill Vol. I"" will have Tarantino fans dancing in the aisles. It was a long time in coming -- the controversial project took the cast and crew from Beijing to Tokyo to Los Angeles and finally to rural Mexico over an eight-month shooting schedule -- and only a maverick like Tarantino would ever attempt this huge script. Moreover nobody but Miramax chief Harvey Weinstein would have given it a green light and then come up with the idea of releasing the long film in two parts. ""Kill Bill Vol. II"" is set to come out February 20 2004. I am counting the days. ""Kill Bill Vol. I"" opens nationwide on Friday October 10 and is rated R.

"Kill Bill is bloody empty bliss. Slate Sign In Sign Up Kill Bill is bloody empty bliss. Kill Bill is bloody empty bliss. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Oct. 9 2003 647 PM Kill Joy Quentin Tarantinos bloody empty bliss. By David Edelstein Death becomes her When hes told in one of his movies that sex without love is an empty experience Woody Allen says ""Yes but as empty experiences go its one of the best."" Thats how I feel about Quentin Tarantinos fourth feature Kill Bill Volume 1 (Miramax). I dont think the movie is totally empty--its just well on the elemental end of the dramatic spectrum. Its about as thematically complex as its title. The story revolves around a woman played by Uma Thurman whose entire wedding party is slain by the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad or DiVAS which is commanded by a guy called Bill (David Carradine--or rather his voice and feet). We dont know what the pregnant bride did to merit execution but we see enough shrieking flashbacks to know that the assault on her was bloody protracted and excruciating. We know why once the Bride (thats what shes called) awakens from a 4-year coma she wants to hack her way through all the DiVAS on her way to the title character whom she once worked for (under the nom de guerre Black Mamba) and who once put a bullet in her head. She doesnt make it to Bill in this volume since Kill Bill was itself hacked into two parts when Tarantino and Miramaxs Harvey Weinstein thought a 3-hour-plus gutbucket revenge flick was a contradiction in terms. I agree; but its important to say that for all its invocation of Hong Kong martial-arts and Japanese shogun-assassin pictures Kill Bill doesnt replicate the 70s cum-stained grind-house experience. Its too playful in its form too artfully scrambled in its narrative syntax too visually resourceful too beautiful. (The velvety cinematography is by Robert Richardson the ecstatic choreography by Yuen Wo-Ping the shrieking 70s trumpets by the RZA.) But what truly distances the movie from its models is the fan-boy giddiness that Tarantino brings to the party. He has never done pure action before He kept the violence off-screen or at a distance in his last film the funky and vastly underrated Jackie Brown (1997). This time he throws himself whole-hog into the carnage. When a mans head is severed and his blood shoots up like the water from an opened fire hydrant you can almost hear him cackle ""This is so cool."" Advertisement Thurman isnt a typical martial-arts heroine either. Shes a tall woman and she doesnt have the superhuman nimbleness of Beijing Opera trained fighters. But I loved watching her heft that Japanese steel Shes enough of an actress to merge her own exertions with the characters. The Bride kills scores--maybe hundreds--of people but none of them casually. And despite the campy dialogue theres a current of emotion that runs through the action. In an early scene the Bride inadvertently kills one of her adversaries in front of the womans very young daughter and the moment hangs ugly and unresolved. The Bride tells the little girl that if shes still feeling raw in a few years she can come for her. A short time later theres a flashback--marvelously animated by the Japanese outfit Production I.G. in the style of an anime like Ghost in the Shell (1998)--in which we learn that the Brides principaladversary the yakuza boss O-Ren (Lucy Liu) became an assassin after avenging her murdered parents. Kill Bill is like a revengers-tragedy hall of mirrors The heroine of one vigilante saga becomes the villain of the next. The movie will not be to everyones taste; Ive already read some tut-tut reviews like the one by David Denby in The New Yorker that ends ""I felt nothing. Not despair. Not dismay. Not amusement. Nothing."" (Like many of my friend Denbys weary plaints this sounds better when you read it with a French accent ""Ah felt ... nossing. Not ze despair ... Not ze dismay ... Not zamuse-mon. Nossing."") For my part I felt glee. I felt the way I sometimes do at a Mark Morris dance piece that reshuffles familiar showbizzy moves into something new and funny and unexpectedly lyrical. Kill Bill literally becomes a dance movie in the course of the final battle. The lights go out and the Bride and a horde of masked assassins are suddenly blue silhouettes gyrating against a great grid Its like An American in Paris with arterial spray. OK Kill Bill is a lot less radical or memorable than either Pulp Fiction (1994) or Jackie Brown (which plays even better when you settle into the Barcalounger and watch it again on video with a couple of beers and a joint). But its in a different universe than Tarantinos pal Robert Rodriguezs recent Once Upon a Time in Mexico which is the same sort of high-body-count straight-to-video material staged and shot by someone with no eye no ear and no sensibility. Kill Bill is about nothing more (or less) than its directors passion for the mindless action pictures that got him through adolescence. It isnt sex without love Its an orgy with just enough love. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

He was sitting on a sofa in the Miramax suite talking a mile a minute but when the publicist introduced us he bounded to his feet. ""John Powers"" he yelped and began quoting from a pan Id written of Michael Ciminos Year of the Dragon in these pages back in 1985. Just as my head was beginning to swell the recitation stopped and he said ""Ive waited seven years to tell you why youre wrong."" Which he promptly began to do in such voluminous detail and with such breathless energy -- hes the kind of talker who listens with his tongue -- that I began grinning at his sheer brio. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Eleven long years have passed and in that time Tarantino has won the Palme dOr at Cannes become an international icon dated Mira Sorvino spawned hundreds of imitators and an anti-Tarantino backlash been abused for the supposed failure of Jackie Brown engaged in high-profile bar fights endured cruel mockery for his acting on and off Broadway disappeared from movie screens for six years and been declared ""over"" more times than rap. Through it all one thing has remained constant -- his headlong crush on cinema. This passion shines through every moment of his new movie Kill Bill Vol. 1 which is at once an astonishing piece of filmmaking and quite possibly an Olympian folly. For Tarantino hasnt made just another movie. Hes tried to make the Ultimate Exploitation Picture a grind-house Ulysses. Kill Bill restlessly moves among many styles and genres in an attempt to embrace them all spaghetti Westerns kung-fu movies samurai flicks yakuza pictures Japanese anime and (as often happens with Tarantino) the Jacobean revenge drama in all its corpuscular glory. This is the bloodiest -- or at least the reddest -- movie youll see all year. The story is basically Charlies Angels in Hell. Uma Thurman stars as The Bride a former killer with the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad led by the sinister Bill (David Carradine present -- so far -- only as a voice). On her wedding day the other members of the outlaw band slaughter The Brides wedding party and leave her for dead. Tarantino has long been drawn to characters who live by precise ethical code and boy does his heroine have one. Rather like Jeanne Moreaus avenging newlywed in Truffauts The Bride Wore Black (her husband was shot on the church steps following the ceremony) The Bride seeks to exact a suitable revenge. She sets about exterminating everyone responsible murdering her way through the Deadly Viper ranks until presumably shes finally able to kill Bill. This long vendetta carries her in Vol. 1 from a Southwest hospital where her comatose body is rented out to yokels as a sex toy (shades of The Gimp) to a candy-colored house in Pasadena where she clashes blades with the former Viper known as Copperhead (Vivica A. Fox) and across the Pacific to Okinawa where a retired ninja (Japanese cult actor Sonny Chiba) makes her a special sword. She needs it for her face-off with O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) the ex-Viper queenpin of Tokyos yakuzaland whos protected by a gang known as the Crazy 88 and a psychopathic teenager Go Go Yubari (Chiaki Kuriyama) clad in one of those schoolgirl uniforms of which middle-aged Japanese pervs are so very fond. While The Brides path couldnt be more straightforward -- she plows ahead like a shark -- Tarantinos way of mapping it brims with his trademark playfulness. Presented as a series of episodic chapters with the fancy titles youd find in a Chinese sword-fighting novel (The Blood-Spattered Bride) Kill Bill plays hopscotch with space and time sometimes leaping ahead sometimes back hopping in and out of flashbacks with the glee of a flea whos discovered a new kennel. Tarantino isnt shy about laying on the flourishes -- he moves neatly between color and ravishing black-and-white photography trots out gaudy CGI effects (a jetliner practically skims the Tokyo rooftops) and takes the radical step of telling O-Ren Ishiis back story entirely in anime. Over the years Ive heard people grumble that Tarantinos storytelling is full of cheap if enjoyable gimmicks but if thats true why have so few filmmakers emulated his gimmickry? The short answer is it takes enormous skill to pull such things off. Its not easy to leapfrog between different time frames or suddenly shift tones -- as when during the knife fight between Thurman and Fox we see in the picture window behind them a yellow school bus dropping off Copperheads little girl. Perhaps because Tarantino became so famous so quickly its been easy to forget that hes an uncommonly talented filmmaker with a knack for vivid imagery (Kill Bill takes him to new levels of flash) an impeccable ear for music selection (he wrings startling emotional depth from Nancy Sinatras cover of ""Bang-Bang"") and a rare generosity toward his performers. Enthralled by his own thespian yearnings (and disappointments) this is a director who knows how to love his actors. He taps into the reservoirs of gravitas in Chiba retools our whole image of Daryl Hannah (who revels in playing a foul-tempered eye-patch-wearing assassin) and reveals inner resources in his lead actress that havent been apparent since Pulp Fiction. Although the towering Thurman is usually treated as something of an eroticized force of nature her sly angry heartfelt performance here brings humanity to an otherwise shallow tale that risks being all blood and no passion. She turns The Bride into an emblem of soulfulness in a sea of creeps and killers. Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm For the opening 45 minutes Vol. 1 is flat-out terrific. Tarantino takes the stuff of Asian movies plunks it down on American soil and gives it a giddy spin of his own. But excitement starts grinding down once The Bride flies off to Japan. Its not exactly that the filmmaking gets lazy -- the pictures intensely imagined and choreographed from beginning to end -- but the inventiveness feels secondhand fetishistic. In William Gibsons novel Pattern Recognition the heroine wears a Japanese copy of a World War II flight jacket that is identical to the original but actually much more precisely and expensively made. One observes the same thing in Tarantinos Japanese sequences He doesnt so much create something new as make even more manically rococo versions of sequences that already exist. Nowhere is this clearer than in the climactic 20-minute ""Showdown at the House of Blue Leaves"" in which The Brides duel with O-Ren Ishii requires her to first fight her way through the Crazy 88 (yes she must dispatch the whole black-and-white keyboard of assassins) and the murderous teenager Go Go Yubari who wields a kind of lethal yo-yo. Obviously eager to produce a classic set piece Tarantino milks every possibility from this battle. He shoots it in color then in black-and-white then in silhouette; he takes us from inside a raucous nightclub with shrieking rock-music chicks to a snowy courtyard whose silence is broken only by the eerie thock of a bamboo waterspout bumping periodically against its basin. Yet even as this scene is worked through in lavish detail its also rather dull. One great pleasure of Asian action cinema is its hyperkinetic ease but here the choreography lacks the knockabout nimbleness you hope for in a chopsocky swordfight and all of Tarantinos directorial tricks (we watch a hatchet flying past us end in slow motion) cant perk up the ponderous redundancy of all those twitching lopped-off limbs and geysers of blood. Like the free-for-all in Matrix Reloaded in which the Mr. Smiths keep arriving and you wish Neo would just fly the hell out of there the girl-power showdown at the House of Blue Leaves continues for so long that it stops the storys momentum dead in its tracks. Even as Kill Bill marks a clear advance in Tarantinos technical facility -- other directors will be strip-mining his ideas for years to come -- its an equally clear retreat from the dawning maturity of Jackie Brown which he doesnt seem to realize is his best and richest film. This battle royal marks the end of Vol. 1. Now it may be that releasing Kill Bill as two separate films will prove a shrewd commercial move especially when Miramax can later bring out a full-length directors cut as a separate DVD. (Three movies for the price of one) But artistically and emotionally cutting the movie in half is a real mistake akin to bringing out one film called The Good the Bad and a second one titled And the Ugly. I left the theater feeling cheated not for the most part by what Id seen but by what I hadnt. After all Tarantino has scaled Kill Bill as a revenge epic intended to accomplish two very difficult objectives make us feel the exhausting weight of The Brides ordeal her agon while creating a mythic compendium of samurai yakuza cowboy and kung-fu films thats all the more dazzling in that each new scene presents us with a different cinematic vision. Youd have to see all of Kill Bill in one sitting to do justice to this elaborate conception. In the three-hour version the House of Blue Leaves will likely prove a powerful centerpiece forcing us to take the full measure of The Brides weary resolve when after her long deadly battle with O-Ren Ishii we grasp that she -- and we -- are only halfway home. Catching the rest of her story next February just isnt the same.  In the press kit Tarantino himself defends the decision to make two volumes ""This is supposed to be my version of a grind-house movie and the very idea of a three-hour grind-house movie is a contradiction in terms. It seemed pretentious whereas two 90-minute grind-house movies seems more appropriate."" Now theres no denying that Tarantinos eager to give Kill Bill a tacky freewheeling air from quoting the Klingons in the opening epigraph to having the credits call the picture ""The 4th Movie by Quentin Tarantino."" That said Vol. 1 is no more an authentic grind-house movie than Raiders of the Lost Ark was an old-time serial It involves too much money po-mo savvy and self-conscious artistry. Although Tarantino grew up surrounded by a gorier pop culture than did Spielberg or Lucas hes essentially doing here what those directors did a quarter-century ago -- creating big-budget versions of the cheesy stuff they grooved on as kids. But as the scores evocations of (and samples from) Ennio Morricone make obvious his ambition and style actually come much closer to the Sergio Leone of Once Upon a Time in the West. Tarantino wants to do for Asian action cinema what Leone did for the Western -- take a dream world already created by the movies and push its dreaminess to the point of self-conscious myth.   Early in his career Tarantino was accused of ripping off other filmmakers -- filching the climax of Reservoir Dogs from Ringo Lams far inferior City on Fire for example. Whenever I have mentioned such charges to Hong Kong filmmakers theyve laughed We steal things all the time. Thats how we make movies. And this is true not only in Hong Kong. Part of the electric excitement of modern culture is its delirious capacity for cross-pollination. One can only marvel how Dashiell Hammetts novel Red Harvest turned into Akira Kurosawas samurai film Yojimbo which became A Fistful of Dollars by Leone whose grandiose style was further hyperbolized by John Woo who then inspired Robert Rodriguez to make Once Upon a Time in Mexico which ups the ante on Woo-ish mayhem while nodding back at Leone. Still when I first heard that Tarantino was making Kill Bill I wondered whether he might be too late. Back in the early 90s hed been ahead of the curve giving Sam Jacksons character Sonny Chiba shtick in Pulp Fiction and urging John Travolta to make pictures with Woo. But the world has changed in the last decade and while the 70s raging bulls and easy riders were inspired by Europes various new waves many of todays filmmakers are clearly turned on by Asia. Audiences now know Jackie Chan and Jet Li. Theyre familiar with Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon which skillfully Westernized its script for international consumption and The Matrix which laced its head-trip sci-fi with kung-fu fighting. Even Sofia Coppolas acclaimed Lost in Translation borrows heavily from Wong Kar-wai the reigning master of urban melancholy whose first U.S. release Chungking Express was brought out by none other than Quentin Tarantino. Whether this increasing awareness of Asian cinema will help turn American audiences on to Kill Bill -- or somehow make it feel stale -- only the next few weeks will reveal. If nothing else Vol. 1 is undeniably a fan-boys paradise with cinematic references sprouting like so many mushrooms. In fact the movies huge press kit reads rather like one of those skeleton keys to Ulysses or Finnegans Wake that help explain Joyces countless cultural allusions. Explaining Tarantinos every intention -- hes a man who wants to be understood -- it makes a nerdish point of telling us that the glass nightclub floor at the House of Blue Leaves comes from Seijun Suzukis hallucinatory 1965 gangster pic Tokyo Drifter and that the young Japanese actress who plays Go Go Yubari ventured a similar role in the late Kinji Fukasakus Battle Royale. While I dont have the faintest idea whether Kill Bill will be a hit or a bomb I do guarantee this Original copies of this 69-page document will one day fetch a pretty penny on eBay.

Fox Chiaki Kuriyama Lucy Liu Michael Madsen LaTanya Richardson Michael Jai White; Director Quentin Tarantino; Author Quentin Tarantino; Release Date Wide 10/10/2003; Runtime (in minutes) 112; Distributor Miramax Posted October 9 2003 -- 1200 AM EDT In his career as a mod maestro of recombinant pop Quentin Tarantino has resurrected and redefined a great many things - John Travolta of course but also Robert Forster 60s surf rock and the low-down dirty kick of blaxploitation. Still I hardly think I would have believed that in Kill Bill - Vol. 1 his delirious splatter opera of cruelty and revenge Tarantino could manage a similar feat of alchemy with Zamfir. Thats right the pan-flute guy. In ""Kill Bill"" Zamfir pipes out ""The Lonely Shepherd"" a quaver of a ballad that sounds like the most haunting spaghetti Western score Ennio Morricone never wrote. It expresses the sadness the loss beneath the heroines violent quest - all of the emotion in fact thats scarcely in the movie itself. Except that it IS in the movie The music welds you to the images to the decadent rapture of violence made lyrical. For a moment I actually thought Zamfir is God You know the feeling Its the Quentin chemical reaction. In ""Kill Bill"" Uma Thurman wearing a sexy sneer of anger smites her enemies without mercy or hesitation. In her flawless fury she bites and stretches the lip of a rapist goes knife-to-knife with Vivica A. Fox in a living-room brawl that looks like it might have come out of ""Foxy Brown 2000"" and then with gleaming samurai sword in hand she slices and dices an endless army of yakuza leaping and twirling as she plunges her weapon into torsos and lops off limbs the blood spurting like Hawaiian Punch. So single-minded is she in her rage her will to dominate and destroy that you could say - and youd be right - that there isnt much human dimension to ""Kill Bill."" Yet that doesnt mean theres nothing at stake. The film may be bloody but its also bloody gorgeous a grandly fetishized epic of cinematic aggression. Its a tale of vengeance that hinges on Tarantinos love of ferocity as spectacle - his immersion in action and exploitation his addiction to the jazzy catharsis of junk-film kicks. Thurman is the Bride who wakes up after a four-year coma with a metal plate in her head her limbs atrophied her soul hardened by the murder of everyone at her El Paso wedding including her unborn baby - a slaughter so evil that the movie rather weirdly makes no attempt to explain it. Who exactly is Bill (David Carradine) the honey-voiced cowboy mastermind of this appalling crime? (We never see his face.) And who are the members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad who helped carry out the deed? We do see them yet their motive remains blank. That it may be revealed in ""Kill Bill - Vol. 2"" due in February scarcely removes the feeling that Tarantino has made a revenge film as perversely abstract as a first-person-shooter videogame. Back in 1994 ""Pulp Fiction"" was a gangster fantasia with true danger because it dared to touch the third rail of life. ""Kill Bill"" is just a funky hermetic pulp bash. Yet what a wizard Tarantino is He hooks us from the get-go with Nancy Sinatra singing ""Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)"" over a silhouette of the Bride in her hospital bed and every scene that follows pulls us deeper into the filmmakers obsessiveness. When Daryl Hannah as one of the Vipers shows up with a deadly syringe you wonder why shes whistling until the screen splits in two and the entire sequence - including that whistle - balloons into a parody of ""Dressed to Kill""-era De Palma. Later in Japan Tarantino uses the theme from ""The Green Hornet"" and he spotlights an insanely cheesy all-girl rock band the 5.6.7.8s to escalate the mood of Tokyo-a-go-go as the camera winds through the House of Blue Leaves right before it becomes an elaborate killing floor. Each sequence in ""Kill Bill"" is like a detour thats more fun than the main road. After meeting the treacherous Viper O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) we get her childhood story as a mesmerizing interlude of anime in which the gore erupts in geysers. By the time the Bride arrives in Okinawa to acquire a lethal blade from Hattori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba) the legendary swordsmith her quest has become a crusade. ""I need Japanese steel"" says Thurman in her most dramatic line reading and Chiba the Japanese B-movie veteran fashions that steel for her in what feels like an act of consummation. As O-Ren Lucy Liu speaking in the soft tones of an ironically polite dominatrix has a drop-dead elegance and she does some slicing and dicing of her own. When she and the Bride face off theres no girl-versus-girl cuteness Theyre warriors pure and simple and hypnotic ones. ""Kill Bill"" may have little on its mind besides pop extravagance yet you can feel the movie tracing a transition in the world - from West to East from male to female rule. Thats Quentin chemistry too.

"Kill Bill (Volume 2) | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; kill-bill-volume-2 ) Kill Bill (Volume 2) (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli Two things are readily apparent about Kill Bill Volume 2. First unlike its predecessor this is a complete movie. It stands on its own. It is possible to see and enjoy Volume 2 in a way that was not true of Volume 1. Viewed in retrospect the first installment now seems like an easily discarded prologue. The real meat is in Volume 2. Secondly Quentin Tarantino needs a new editor - someone who can convince him to make the really hard cuts. Sally Menke who has held that post for all of Tarantinos movies couldnt/wouldnt/didnt convince the ego-centric filmmaker that eliminating about 30 minutes of filler from Kill Bill Volume 2 would have made it a leaner meaner motion picture. The running time is 130 minutes; it should have been about 130. Gripes about the needless length are not minor. There are too many scenes in this film that damage the pacing. It feels bloated - as if the director given the freedom afforded by lopping off 100 minutes and calling it Volume 1 could re-insert all sorts of material originally slated for the cutting room floor. (Do the math. If the original cut of Kill Bill was about 190 minutes and the running times of the split parts are 108 minutes and 130 minutes respectively that means Tarantino got an extra 40 minutes.) Rather than flowing smoothly Kill Bill Volume 2 lurches from point-to-point giving screen time to secondary characters who are neither colorful enough nor intriguing enough to warrant it. This is the case of a director having fallen too much in love with his material. Every scene is a child; he wont give it up. The result is that much of Volume 2 for all of its strengths is self-indulgent. Thats the bad news. The good news is that despite its lugubriousness its still a good motion picture - a clear improvement upon episode one. Theres much less action a lot more talking and a legitimate effort to build the characters played by Uma Thurman and David Carradine. Those in search of a kung-fu gore-fest like Volume 1 will be sorely disappointed. There are a few action sequences (about four depending on what you count as ""action"") all of which are quick and brutal. Theres nothing even as sustained as the one-on-one between Thurman and Vivica A Fox in Volume 1. Volume 2 is a talky affair. Although much of the dialogue isnt vintage Tarantino (except a scene like Bills ""Superman"" monologue) theres no sense that the characters are inflicted with run-on-at-the-mouth disease. The movie picks up where Volume 1 ended with the Bride (Thurman) gunning for her surviving two would-be assassins and Bill (Carradine). Theres not much more to the film than that. Budd (Michael Madsen) takes longer to dispatch than the Bride plans but Elle (Daryl Hannah) goes a lot more quickly. The confrontation with Bill involves more talking than fighting a choice which fits the circumstances. About 50% of the movie is used to provide backstory. We get a lengthy flashback to events leading up to the wedding chapel massacre as well as a lengthy training sequence in which the Bride learns to become an expert assassin under the tutelage of Pai Mei (Gordon Liu). (For those unfamiliar with the Hong Kong flicks that serve as Tarantinos main inspiration for this segment of the movie think Yoda with a bad attitude.) The background material in Volume 2 fills out the characters nicely. The Bride even gets a name Beatrix Kiddo. And as hinted at during the last scene of Volume 1 she has a new role as well Mommy. From a stylistic standpoint Tarantino pulls a lot of rabbits out of his hat. Parts of the movie are in black-and-white (and since Thurman is dressed all in white she appears to glow). There are shifts in the aspect ratio. (One sequence is in 1.331.) One fight scene involves a split-screen. A two-minute scene occurs in complete darkness. The soundtrack occasionally borrows from 70s exploitation scores often with intentionally humorous results. Some of this is probably Tarantino showing off but for the most part it provides a satisfying visual variability. If Thurman was good in Volume 1 as an avenging angel shes better here where the role requires a much greater range. We see a lot more of Beatrix than a woman bent on avenging her attempted murder and Thurman never misses a beat. Volume 1 highlighted the actress physical prowess; Volume 2 highlights her emotional capacity. David Carradine proves to be an apt adversary. Hes calm and mature with only a hint of danger in his eyes. He prefers words to weapons and is apparently a loving father. One of the strengths of the film is that Tarantino and Carradine develop Bill into a person rather than simply a cartoonish frothing-at-the-mouth villian. Michael Madsen is his usual laconic self and Daryl Hannah plays against type as a conscienceless killer. Gordon Liu a veteran Chinese actor has a standout role lampooning the traditional kung-fu master role. (Count the number of times he flips his beard.) And theres an throw-away cameo by Samuel L. Jackson as an organ player. I enjoyed Kill Bill Volume 2 more than Volume 1. The second movie is less kinetic but more satisfying. Tonally the two films are different which may be the result of the split. Hopefully Tarantinos original single-movie cut of Kill Bill will eventually be available on DVD. With the two parts re-knitted and much of the extraneous material removed this could be a great motion picture right up there with Pulp Fiction. As it currently stands Kill Bill is a victim of its directors ego and its distributors greed. The moments of greatness make it worth seeing and theres certainly plenty of entertainment to be found here but its hard not to lament what might have been.
