Granny on the other hand is feeling a little down. Arthurs grandfather you see disappeared some time ago after venturing to the bottom of the garden in search of buried treasure - as you do. And now the bailiffs have arrived to repossess the house. Only one thing for it Arthur must unravel grandads easy-to-decipher clues meet a group of African tribesmen and with the aid of a telescope be reduced to the size of an ant so that he can save a community of silly-looking underground elves from the clutches of David Bowies evil Maltazard. Only then will Arthur find the hidden rubies pay off the repossessors and live happily ever after. Luc Bessons half-baked live-action/animated fantasy looks like it was invented on the hoof its erratically plotted poorly animated overly derivative and too insufferably cute to interest anyone above undemanding toddler age - or perhaps those stoners familiar with Roger Deans LP covers of the 70s.

Arthur and the Invisibles -- half-live-action half-CG kids adventure -- is (by a hair) more bad-bad like The Fifth Element than good-bad like The Big Blue. Freddie Highmore is a kid who to save his grannys farm must turn into a cartoon and enter the tiny world of the Minimoys. There he engages in some derivative derring-do and romances a princess voiced by Madonna. She and Highmore are officially the weirdest voice-over pairing of all time.

"Arthur Technically soulless | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesArthur Technically soullessAlways the most blockbuster-oriented of French directors Luc Besson has created a body of work that is at once moderately eccentric and safely generic. Arthur and the Invisibles his attempt at a computer animated kids adventure is no exception.By Geoff PevereEntertainment ColumnistFri. Jan. 12 2007 (Out of 4)Starring Freddie Highmore and Mia Farrow with voices from Robert de Niro Madonna David Bowie and Jimmy FallonWritten by Luc Besson and Celine Garcia. 102 minutes. At major theatres. G Article Continued Below Always the most blockbuster-oriented of French directors Luc Besson has created a body of work (La Femme Nikita The Fifth Element The Messenger) that is at once moderately eccentric and safely generic. Its as though he studied the work of Steven Spielberg George Lucas and James Cameron from a safe cultural distance and in some rather perverse display of cultural pride insisted that hed make Hollywood come to him before hed ever go Hollywood.Based on a series of childrens books hes written about a young boy and the little people who live beneath his lawn Bessons half-cartoon/half live action Arthur and the Invisibles sees Besson trying his hand a big-budget computer-animated kids adventure and the result is predictably well Bessonian a Hollywood-esque fantasy-adventure movie filtered through the strangely distancing scrim of an international co-production. To wit beneath the surface collision of accents dubbing and cross-Atlantic editing discrepancies (the North American version is considerably shorter than the European) lies a movie about a lonely boy whom magical intervention turns into the rescuer of a hidden kingdom. After learning that his grandmother (Mia Farrow) is about to have her farm foreclosed young Arthur (Freddie Highmore) dedicates himself to finding the rubies his long-missing grandfather has buried on the property. Arthur eventually finds himself transported to the world of the ""Minimoys"" a race of tiny people with hair like mid-80s synth-rock stars and ears that twitch with computer-generated cuteness. Welcomed by a king voiced by Robert de Niro and smitten by a perky princess voiced by Madonna Arthur embarks on a quest to rid the Minomoys of their David Bowie-voiced nemesis Maltazard. While technically polished and adequately executed Arthur like most of Bessons movies is a strangely soulless experience a voracious vacuuming of movies references and mythologies so familiar as to be rote to all but the most uninitiated of viewers and thrown together in a kind of amped-up desperation that isnt helped by the fact that the result seems to have been reduced to a series of exhaustingly disengaging computer-animated chase sequences. But that may be the films primary saving grace if youre only going to go where everyones been before the least you can do is blast through faster than the speed of thought.

(AP Photo/The Weinstein Company) Photo Ho Strange films purpose Invisible 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Arthur and the Invisibles Childrens drama. Starring Mia Farrow Freddie Highmore and the voices of Madonna Robert De Niro and Snoop Dogg. Directed by Luc Besson. (PG. 102 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) There are few new concepts in ""Arthur and the Invisibles"" but theres at least one surprise behind the scenes. The new childrens film is directed by Luc Besson -- the man behind modern cult action favorites including ""The Professional"" and ""La Femme Nikita"" -- who apparently spends his spare time writing childrens books about tiny troll people called Minimoys. Does this mean Beverly Cleary has a secret revenge-murder screenplay about a brooding loner who knows martial arts? Besson is a pro when it comes to action movies but this part live part animation effort is a mess highlighted by creepy animation derivative plot points and a child star who speaks way too fast as if hes trying to force three hours of dialogue into a 102-minute movie. Come to think of it everyone in this production -- director Besson actress Mia Farrow even the animators -- must have been shotgunning cans of Mountain Dew between each take. New characters seem to be introduced every 12 seconds and a fight ensues every other minute setting a pace so attention deficit-disorder-friendly that any pleasant moments are quickly trampled by the next frenetic action scene. Freddie Highmore is Arthur a flesh-and-blood boy who lives with his grandmother on a family homestead that is 48 hours from foreclosure. The movie is quite enjoyable in these early scenes which are light and fun and free of excessive mayhem. But then things get really weird. While the movie is still using live actors Arthur runs into some African tribesmen who shrink him to the size of a sea monkey and hes transported into an animated colony of tiny people with hair like Don King and a government that bears a resemblance to 17th century France. Just when it seems impossible that the movie could get any stranger youll start recognizing the voices of the computer-animated characters -- including Robert De Niro as a king sprite Snoop Dogg as some kind of underground bug/monkey thing and bad guy David Bowie as ... well ... its never really clear what he is. Imagine if Jim Henson and ""Alien"" designer H.R. Giger spent a weekend in a landfill trying to collaborate on a puppet -- using only scraps of clothing ripped Hefty bags and rotting food. If that doesnt make sense neither does much of ""Arthur and the Invisibles"" which appears to take place in the 1950s yet includes a musical number that includes Bowies 1983 hit ""Lets Dance."" To be fair its a kids movie and children arent going to know or care whether the soundtrack matches the movies period setting. They also wont know that Snoop Dogg starred in and co-produced a piece of adult cinema called ""Snoop Doggs Hustlaz Diary of a Pimp"" -- which while perfectly legal should have led to a lifetime ban on participating in childrens programming. This would probably be a good place to point out that ""Arthur and the Invisibles"" is an appropriate movie for older kids but earns its PG rating with scary scenes later in the movie that might frighten younger kids straight out of the theater and into a screening of ""Charlottes Web."" Why not keep things simple and start there in the first place? -- Advisory This movie contains voice acting work by Madonna whose character is skinnier than Kate Bosworth in ""Superman Returns"" dresses like a Renaissance Faire hooker and has a mid-January/December romance with a 10-year-old kid. Theres also a lot of violence.

The Human and the Animated Shrunk to Size By NEIL GENZLINGER Published January 12 2007 Sign In to E-Mail Print Reprints Correction Appended In the latest wowzer merging of the real and the fabricated ""Arthur and the Invisibles"" takes actual human actors and through a complex process involving Slim-Fast and a Maytag dryer shrinks them to the size of bacteria so they can interact with the microscopic beings who live in your backyard along with Rick Moranis and his family. Or something like that. The press packet for ""Arthur"" a childrens film directed by Luc Besson includes lots of tidbits on the magic that enabled the merging of live actors and a computer-generated world but who can really keep track of this technogoo anymore or get excited about it? The real question isnt how these hybrid movies are made but why. In this case its a tad unclear. The film begins in the conventional human world of the early 1960s where Arthur (Freddie Highmore) and his grandmother (Mia Farrow) have troubles galore Grandpa went missing a few years ago and developers are on the verge of taking over the family homestead. Arthur manages to shrink himself to near-invisibility so he can enter a secret world and search for some gems that will solve all the problems. At this point the film becomes computer-generated and also resembles at various times ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids"" ""The Sword in the Stone"" ""Fraggle Rock"" and assorted others. The computer-generated world is visually rich but short on the droll humor that makes good childrens films bearable for adults. Its also too frenetically paced and confusing for adults or children. But many of the voices are familiar Madonna Jimmy Fallon Snoop Dogg David Bowie Harvey Keitel Robert De Niro and other famous names provide them. There are so many famous names that the question arises Would this movie have been more enjoyable with the real humans instead of just their voices? Yes. Although that would have required Madonna to have a budding romance with a tweenage boy. Hmm. ARTHUR AND THE INVISIBLES Opens today nationwide Directed by Luc Besson; written by Mr. Besson and Celine Garcia based on the original story by Ms. Garcia and Patrice Garcia and the books by Mr. Besson and Ms. Garcia; CG director Pierre Buffin; director of photography Thierry Arbogast; music by Eric Serra; production designer Hugues Tissandier; produced by Mr. Besson and Emmanuel Prevost; released by MGM and the Weinstein Company.

With Freddie Highmore Mia Farrow; voices of Madonna Robert De Niro. Director Luc Besson (142). PG Action. Area theaters. Luc Besson a sort of French version of Steven Spielberg without the intuition has tried a lot of genres in his young career and has had his greatest success with slick action films like ""The Fifth Element"" and ""La Femme Nikita."" Animated movies for kids he should stay away from. Bessons ""Arthur and the Invisibles"" which mixes live-action performances with computer animation is a strangely humorless unnecessarily dense cartoon about a 10-year-old boy (Freddie Highmore) who shrinks to the size of a peanut assumes the figure of a rubber dime-store doll and joins an underground kingdom of Lilliputians called Minimoys. Arthurs mission is two-fold Help the beautiful Princess Selenia (voice of Madonna) save both the Minimoys from the evil wizard Maltazard (David Bowie) and the familys Connecticut farm from an evil developer (Adam LeFevre). While hes among the Minimoys he might as well rescue his grampa who disappeared three years earlier after burying a treasure of rubies in the yard. Those rubies represent the salvation of the farm. The convoluted story by Besson and Celine Garcia is Pack Rat Screenwriting 101 with so many references and ideas invoking so many movies and fairy tales that an alphabetical list here would take up all my space. But the message as Dr. Frankenstein famously learned is that good intentions a full complement of parts and proper assembly do not guarantee a successful result. ""Arthur"" has its rewarding moments particularly in the live-action sections with the delightful Highmore and Mia Farrow as his kind grandmother. But the animated adventure is a galumphing mishmash. Though some of the characters are as inventively designed as those in the ""Star Wars"" bar scene they dont even seem to share the same fantasy world. No two characters resemble each other though the furry-bottom King (Robert De Niro) is the father of reasonably human Princess Selenia and the squirrely Betamesh (Jimmy Fallon) is her brother. There are plenty of action scenes with flying insects swordfights and martial arts but good luck to toddlers trying to follow either those or the story. The original soundtrack was in French; they may as well have kept it.

"The kingdom isnt magic in Arthur and the Invisibles - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW The kingdom isnt magic in Arthur and the Invisibles Madonna gives voice to Princess Selenia in Luc Bessons fantasy. (ASSOCIATED PRESS) By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  January 12 2007 Watching ""Arthur and the Invisibles"" is like sticking your head in a Gallic pinball machine Its hectic technically impressive and your skull starts to pound after a while.Directed by the one-time French film wunderkind Luc Besson (""La Femme Nikita"") this part-live action/part-computer-generated fairy tale is based on Bessons two childrens books ""Arthur and the Minimoys"" and ""Arthur and the Forbidden City"" which in turn were mulched from pieces of Tolkien C.S. Lewis Roald Dahl and other writers with genuine skill. Besson seems to think knocking off a fantasy world is something anyone can do but heres his movie to prove otherwise.At least we have Freddie Highmore  the large-souled lad from ""Finding Neverland"" and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" as resourceful young Arthur. He lives in a clattertrap country house with his fretful Granny (Mia Farrow) waiting for his explorer Grandpa (Ron Crawford) to return from his travels. The appearance of a condo-building meanie (Adam LeFevre ) with eviction papers leaves the two with 48 hours to find Gramps and his rumored stash of rubies.Using clues the old man left behind Arthur locates and transports himself to the land of the Minimoys a tribe of people roughly the size of a Tic Tac who live in his back yard. On the journey hes morphed into a Minimoy himself a big-headed wide-eyed CGI sprite. He looks like Billy Idol the Smurf.Which makes sense since Arthurs new love interest the tough and unnervingly curvy Princess Selenia speaks with the voice of Madonna. The singer drops the faux-British accent and does a perfectly fine job but just thinking about the quasi-romantic scenes between the 14-year-old Highmore and the 48-year-old Madge makes me feel unclean.Robert De Niro voices the Minimoy King while Harvey Keitel plays his adjutant -- ""Mean Streets"" has never seemed so far away. Jimmy Fallon plays Selenias bratty kid brother while Snoop Dogg and Anthony Anderson voice ghetto elves (sorry theres no other way to put it).Most enjoyable is David Bowie as the chief villain He Who Cannot Be Na -- I mean Maltazard. This character is an eerie visual presence with a long tall head that suggests an Egyptian crown and hed be marvelous to look at if ""Arthur and the Invisibles"" stood still long enough.Instead the movie bing-bing-bings all over the place repurposing fantasy novels video games Arthurian legends. Bessons grocery bill for all I know. Even the musical score has multiple-personality disorder downshifting from a symphonic score into bar-band rock and promptly stalling.The digital animation is sleek luxuriant and artfully done without quite making it over the hump to art. Anyway the movies most special effect turns out to be Highmore in his actual physical skin. Talking about his missing Grandpa early in the film the actor quietly works his way into sorrow bringing a tear first to his eye and then to ours. Thats more magical than anything they dig up in the lawn.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/ae/movies/blog. (c) Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company.

White L. Frank Baum and fancy picture books featuring pretty pointy-earred elves. Arthur and the Invisibles what a mess. Luc Besson the most-Hollywoodish of Gallic directors has adapted his own series of popular (in France) kid-lit tomes to produce a glossy expensive (84 million) and long-winded mix of live action and computer animation. The live-action part stars child actor Freddie Highmore as Arthur a lonely lad living with his grandmother (Mia Farrow in those socks) in a Connecticut house about to be seized by a greedy real estate baron. The CG part stars a race of ""Minimoys"" - tiny creatures with irradiated saucer eyes and cute green jerkin outfits. The Minimoys princess Selenia (the voice of Madonna) bears an uncanny resemblance to Bessons ex the model and Joan of Arc star Milla Jovovich - if her ears jutted out like quivering stalks of endive. There are really no invisibles in Arthur and the Invisibles - just a lot of wee teeny beings scampering around in Grandmas garden. But there are plenty of gruesome characters that look as if they just dropped in from the Mos Eisley Cantina. Most notable Maltazard a spindly lipless cadaverous villain voiced by David Bowie. The English-language version of Arthur is truly terrible with dubbing work by the unlikeliest gang Robert De Niro Harvey Keitel Snoop Dog and Chazz Palminteri. Whatd they do after Besson called ""Cut"" - go shoot something for Scorsese? Arthur and the Invisibles 1/2 (out of four stars) Written by Luc Besson and Celine Garcia directed by Besson.

By David Germain updated 1/11/2007 31922 PM ET 2007-01-11T201922 Print Font + - REVIEW Crafted for a family audience Luc Bessons live-action and animation combo ""Arthur and the Invisibles"" might be more appropriate for the pothead crowd given the movies wildly jarring visuals and often incomprehensible action. The whole thing might make sense to fans with a buzz on. For everyone else ""Arthur"" is a mishmash with a distinctive but disorderly animation palette whose top-notch voice cast -- including Robert De Niro Madonna and David Bowie -- gets lost in the muck. Besson best-known for live-action extravaganzas such as ""La Femme Nikita"" and ""The Fifth Element"" concedes he knew nothing about animation before directing ""Arthur"" which is based on a visual world created by comic-book author Patrice Garcia. His wife Celine Garcia co-wrote the script with Besson. The lesson is Dont let an animation amateur direct a cartoon flick. The movie opens with a live-action prologue as young Arthur (Freddie Highmore of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"") and his grandmother (Mia Farrow) face eviction from the family homestead by a scheming land developer. The only solution is a cache of rubies hidden away for some reason by Arthurs grandfather (Ronald Crawford) an engineer and adventurer who vanished a few years earlier. Gramps left behind clues to lead Arthur to a group of little people called the Minimoys tiny elves living in the familys garden who hold the key to finding the jewels. In a whirlwind of muddled action Arthur is shrunk to Minimoy size with most of the remainder of the movie playing out through computer animation. Arthur actually transforms into a pointy-eared Minimoy with a bizarre shock of white hair a punk-rock outfit and strange new powers such as the ability like his namesake from Camelot to pull a magical sword from a stone. Advertise Advertise Advertise Minimoy Arthur weaves back and forth from looking cute and creepy as do the other denizens of this miniature realm including the King (De Niro) his mischievous son (Jimmy Fallon) an aide (Harvey Keitel) and a couple of Rasta-esque good Samaritans (Snoop Dogg and Anthony Anderson). The exception visually is the princess Selenia (Madonna) whose character is endowed with eerily human facial expressions and is one of the most luscious animated babes ever created. Arthur certainly thinks so. Hes immediately smitten and Selenia gradually returns his amorous feelings. Granted these are just cartoon figures but theres something mildly unsavory about a 48-year-old woman and a 14-year-old boy providing voices for characters who have the hots for each other. Madonnas character is 1000 years old Highmores is an adolescent and you almost expect Arthur to mutter ""Miss Selenia youre trying to seduce me."" Through madcap turgid action sequences Selenia and Arthur lead an expedition to foil a plot by a warped villain (Bowie) to destroy the Minimoys. Striking images occasionally leap out and the animation outfit BUF Cie has crafted a unique world but the quick-cutting visuals and vague story are such a jumble that its hard to even want to make sense of the movie. Things do end on a positive note Besson and company adding a very clever animated curtain call in the closing credits. Not the best place for the highlight of your film but at least its something.

"Little Things Mar Arthur washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Little Things Mar Arthur Jimmy Fallon Freddie Highmore Madonna and others lend their voices to ""Arthur and the Invisibles."" (By Ehunne Geoise -- Weinstein Co.) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints Friday January 12 2007 ""Arthur and the Invisibles"" is easy to lightly enjoy -- especially for its intermixing of live action and computer-generated imagery. But Luc Bessons film isnt quite so easy to love. Thats because the French director (who also made ""La Femme Nikita"" and ""The Fifth Element"") has devoted more attention to technology and his visual schemes than to making a propulsive story and cultivating his characters. In the movie based on the childrens book ""Arthur and the Minimoys"" the precocious and wildly imaginative Arthur (Freddie Highmore) minimizes himself -- it takes a full moon a telescope and other mumbo jumbo -- to join the world of the almost microscopic Minimoys. Arthur now represented as a CGI creation must retrieve precious stones that will keep the loan wolves away from his grandparents farm. He also needs to save his grandpa a world adventurer last seen among the Minimoys. Highmore the extraordinary talent who lighted up ""Finding Neverland"" and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is this movies most exciting element. Hes so energized he practically pulls the movie along with him. David Bowie is deliciously well Bowiesque as the voice of the arrogant insectlike leader Maltazard. And its fun to vicariously visit a world in which nutshells become enormous boats and dragonfly eggs are as large as grapefruits. But this childrens epic is slowed considerably by a convoluted multi-tiered plotline in which we bounce between the human world and the Minimoy one. None of the characters are compelling despite the star-studded vocal cast behind them including Madonna Robert De Niro Snoop Dogg and Jimmy Fallon. Our attitude toward them is casual interest not anxious concern. -- Desson Thomson Arthur and the Invisibles PG 94 minutes Contains scenes of jeopardy and suspense. Area theaters.

The bucolic wonder buried in Luc Bessons ""Arthur and the Invisibles"" has been snuffed out by this alienating and dislikable animated film. As overproduced and acrid as Bessons ""The Messenger The Story of Joan of Arc"" and ""The Fifth Element"" this adventure tale of a lad who enters a subterranean world haplessly blends live-action and visually repellent computer-animated work. Dubbed French version is Gauls fifth-largest opener ever but the 80 million pricetag will prove a huge obstacle given a likely yawner Yank bow in its English-language version Jan. 12 after a Dec. 29 Oscar-qualifying run. The sources and ideas that are borrowed copied or stolen here include the tales of King Arthur to ""The Matrix Reloaded"" ""The African Queen"" ""Star Wars"" and ""The Wizard of Oz."" Script based on Bessons French tome ""Arthur et les Minimoys"" (which spawned three sequels) apes the Joseph Campbell hero myth template thats become a bible for Hollywoods current generation -- and offers proof the template is exhausted. In a weird coincidence story elements sometimes match the recent ""The Ant Bully"" while live-action lensing (by Thierry Arbogast favoring wide-angle focal lengths) echoes the same technique in Terry Gilliams ""Tideland"" also dwelling on a kid a big house and the outdoors. Opening set in 1960 thrusts auds rudely into the rambling Connecticut home of young Arthurs (Freddie Highmore) kindly grandmother (Mia Farrow). Arthur is obsessed with the illustrated diary of African travels penned by his grandfather Archibald (Ron Crawford) who vanished without a trace four years earlier. Also absent for reasons never made clear are Arthurs parents (Penny Balfour Doug Rand) who phone their son from a distant city on his birthday. Similarly unexplained is why Arthur and his folks are Brits while his grandfolks are Yanks. Reality knocks on the door when a ruthless developer (Adam LeFevre) presents deep-in-debt granny with papers making him the property owner. Arthur realizes that if hes able to retrieve a cluster of rubies his grandfathers diary claims is somewhere in the land of the tiny Minimoys (who actually live underground just outside the house) his granny can buy back her home. Via grandpas tiresomely detailed instructions and with the aid of African tribesmen who suddenly appear on the night of a new moon Arthur is able to descend into the ""seven kingdoms"" of the Minimoys. Arthur himself must pass through a metallic iris that transforms him into a minuscule kid with punkish hair and then is brought to the court of the king (Robert De Niro). Transition is grating and annoying on multiple levels. First dialogue (already plentiful) goes into overdrive and is encumbered by hip sarcasm -- suggesting that while the humans above are living in 1960 the folks below are in post-2006. Animation of the slightly feline Minimoys (featuring small pointy noses and Mr. Spock ears) is flat and rigid with extremely uneven synching of English voices to mouths. One can only imagine the odd effect in other languages in which the film is dubbed. Failing to warn the court -- and oh-so-cool Princess Selenia (Madonna) -- that their realm is in danger of being bulldozed Arthur ends up helping his new allies in a fight against insectoid invaders. Arthur Selenia and cohort Betameche (Jimmy Fallon) venture into the lair of evil lord Maltazard (David Bowie) who has control of the rubies. Action takes shape as a predictable string of adventures and near-misses through a forest of grass and the final confrontation with Maltazard cant come too soon. Action is overly complicated by devices large and small making it hard to believe younger children will put up with the talkfest for long. Denouement in a return to live-action amounts to a rote afterthought. Highmore and Farrow display some sparks of odd-couple interest but Farrow especially seems out of her element as a grandmother. Voices rarely match up well with specific characters with the exceptions of Madonna and Bowie in magnificent form. Having African-Americanthesps Snoop Dogg and Anthony Anderson voice creatures that are basically humanoid monkeys shows poor taste. Bessons promise to retire from directing after this film (his previous ""Angel-A"" has yet to open Stateside) will strike some as timely. Typical of the pics strident tone is a dreadfully conceived Eric Serra score.
