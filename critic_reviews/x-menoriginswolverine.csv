(Maybe Yes) By Sara Vilkomerson  05/01/09 1159am O.K. so I saw X-Men Origins Wolverine. Much like all of you I too had heard the talk from all those people who downloaded (for shame) the incomplete version and took to the Internet to talk trash and etc. and  as much as you sort of wish you didnt pay attention to such things you know you do ... which is all a long-winded way of saying  that I was pleasantly surprised when I finally settled in and watched the film. But let me make this clear There is no way I would call this a good movie. But I was indeed entertained the whole way through and there were enough genuinely interesting scenes to almost make up for the incredibly clunky moments provided by a very wooden screenplay. Did the plot points stick in my head five minutes after leaving the theater? Not so much ... but I know I was having fun while watching. Hugh Jackman works his claws off as the title character (no surprise there remember that amazing Oscar opener he did in February? The man commits). We go way back in time and meet him as a little sickly boy and witness a family tragedy that brings on the rage plus we meet his brother Victor/Sabertooth played by Liev Schreiber who threatens to steal this whole damn movie from all the other good-looking fellas onscreen. Because my goodness theres a lot We got Ryan Reynolds Taylor Kitsch (a.k.a. Tim Riggins) Dominic Monaghan--who brought some real sadness to his role--Will i Am (making his feature film debut) and Daniel Henney. There arent really any ladies in this thing except for the very lovely Kyla Silverfox (played by Lynn Collins) who helps propel Wolverine towards his ultimate destiny. For all those who love an origins story (who doesnt) you are in luck as this film directed by Gavin Hood (Tsotsi) seeks to explain just how it is the mysterious Logan/Wolverine arrived as we met him way back in the first X-Men film in 2000. Now listen I could prattle on here about which mutant does what but while Ive always loved the whole X-Men franchise I cant pretend to know or understand all the crazy amounts of backstory on each of them. And one cant really spend too much time worrying about why it is Hugh Jackman and Liev Schreiber dont age until they hit the age we see them at how come they they seem to fight in every single war but yet Wolverine becomes Canadian with a weird New York accent  how exactly adamantium works or what exactly the deal with that chick with the diamond skin is; Ill leave that up to the comic book geeks. I cant imagine how theyll react to this film. Compared to its X-Men cinematic siblings Id put it after number one and two but and maybe tie it with number three. One thing is for sure though ... I like it more than watching Watchmen.

By David Denby Share Tweet Table of Contents Men of violence Hugh Jackmans Wolverine takes on Iron Mike. Credit Illustration by Tom Bachtell Violence (not sex) is the bedrock of international mass culture--violent aggression as joyfully dispensed by the male body whether sheathed (Spider-Man) tuxedoed (Bond) cool in black (Bourne) shirtless (Sylvester Stallone) hairless (Vin Diesel) or naked (Arnold Schwarzenegger and now Hugh Jackman). Two new summer-season fictions and a brilliant new documentary fuel our endless desire to see prowess so devastating that it transforms mere force into iconography and fighting into epic struggle. In the noisy ""X-Men Origins Wolverine"" two warring mutant brothers Liev Schreiber a morose sadist with fangs and Hugh Jackman unhappy but ripped fly at each other again and again grappling punching slashing. Alas theres nothing quite memorable here much of the combat is just a whirl of movement photographed up close. As the ""X-Men"" series has progressed the startling poetic extravagances of the first film have given way to flesh-pounding clumsiness; the men might be two Humvees at war. The director Gavin Hood (""Rendition"") has mastered a standard vocabulary of digital effects including the inescapable scene of men crashing through a window and has added faintly ridiculous new feats such as Jackmans leaping onto an airborne helicopter and shearing off the blades with the cutlery springing from his fists. Wolverine it turns out is using expanded powers. In this prequel to the series Wolverine ne Logan (Jackman) after fighting for more than a century in every known war retires to the tranquil ecstasy of life in the Canadian Rockies. But the devious Colonel Stryker (Danny Huston) claiming that he can make him indestructible searches him out dips him in a glass laboratory bathtub and injects a substance called adamantium into his veins his bones and his organs. Naked a buff Frankensteins monster Wolverine escapes and Stryker tries to hunt him down. But this act makes little sense since the Colonel has just created the superhero anew. The story devised by David Benioff and Skip Woods is largely meaningless and the emotions are no more than functional--they set up the next fight. Schreiber and Jackman maul each other but since no one will die theres not much suspense about the outcome of any given battle. As we now know the point of these unresolved struggles is to prepare the way not just for the next fight but inevitably and a little cynically for the next movie. I was a little surprised to hear that ""Fighting"" had received a rating of PG-13. A movie devoted to the sullen art of bare-knuckle boxing in New York--scratch-and-claw combat without rules--approved for young adults and kids? How do you pull that off? As it turns out ""Fighting"" holds back from the brutality of its subject. The movies language is chaste and although the fights staged in alleyways back rooms and buildings under construction may look violent at first glance the actual blows and the pain of battle are either hidden by tricky editing or just ignored. The hero Shawn MacArthur (Channing Tatum) after being thrown to the pavement or a marble floor and flung against whatever furniture happens to be around shows up the next day with no more than a few decorative bruises on his face. (Ive looked worse after slipping in the tub.) Tatum a tall lean abs-enhanced former model makes Shawn an awfully nice fellow--a mass of gentle hurting inarticulate impulses. The movie seems calculated to appeal not just to teen-age boys but to teen-age girls too which would be fine if the hero snarled a bit--if he werent set up so unconvincingly as a polite diffident country boy tough in a fight but a complete sweetie when he talks to the vulnerable young single mother (Zulay Henao) he falls for. Channing Tatum has more grit than such other angel-faced actors as Orlando Bloom Zac Efron and the goofy Ashton Kutcher but at the moment he seems like a greater Josh Hartnett rather than a lesser Paul Newman. Yet even if the movie is a fake as a fight picture its still a decent commercial entertainment. The independent film director Dito Montiel (""A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints"") who wrote ""Fighting"" with Robert Munic is from New York and he has a feel for the hostile atmosphere of the after-hours city the plug-ugly types lounging outside a crooked convenience store; the fey knowing sarcasm of professional gamblers particularly the money man played by Roger Guenveur Smith who mouths each word as if it were so precious that he didnt want to let it go. Theres life in this corrupt night world--Montiel is alert to the avidity of a bored fight crowd waiting for something dirty to happen. Hes no Scorsese but he roughens the surface of his scenes letting characters interrupt and talk over one another. He also gets an interesting performance out of Terrence Howard as a saddened philosophical hustler named Harvey Boarden a gent who barely survives in the urban muck. Harvey knows the gamblers the limo drivers the enforcers but hes not ruthless enough for his chosen milieu; he likes peace and quiet around him a proper level of civilization no matter how rough the game. Howard softens his voice--he almost croons--and his Harvey moves catlike through the city attended by a posse of boys who run errands for him. He forms a partnership with Shawn in the hope that the big kid will become his meal ticket. As the stakes get higher and higher (winner takes all) Shawn fights a series of murderous-looking men including a Russian bruiser a Korean kick-boxer and a nasty rival (Brian White) from his past. The fights may not be very convincing but the storys underdog structure is satisfying in a happy-cliche sort of way. ""Fighting"" is ""Rocky"" without the bombast ""Fight Club"" without the daft metaphysical pretensions. Lonely and broke the hero works out in an empty subway car in the middle of the night. New Yorkers who would never attend a bare-knuckle shindy can easily identify with his determination to lick this city one way or another. The spectacle of a savage fight however ineptly done or digitally enhanced brings one back to a climactic moment in James Tobacks documentary ""Tyson"" a portrait of a boxer once advertised as ""the baddest man on the planet."" It was in November 1996 that Mike Tyson then the W.B.A. heavyweight champion got head-butted by the challenger Evander Holyfield--a blow that opened a cut over Tysons eye and led to a T.K.O. victory for Holyfield. My inexpert view is that the head-butt was accidental. But seven months later the men fought again and Holyfield the taller of the two leaned over and head-butted Tyson once more. It all happened very quickly but this time to me the act looked calculated. Tyson certainly thought so and famously and disastrously went berserk biting Holyfield first on one ear and then on the other losing the match his boxing license and three million dollars in fines. Confirming the reputation as a semi-psychotic thug he had earned a few years earlier with a conviction for rape Tyson hurled himself farther down a spiral of disgrace from which he has never recovered. He behaved abominably--it was an iconic moment in all the wrong ways. At the time however the extreme contempt that many sportswriters and fans poured on him felt a little disingenuous. Professional boxing is defined by an elaborate set of regulations and traditions designed to channel violence into craft aggression into honor. Tyson flouting all these protocols and baring his teeth in an act that evoked cannibalism demonstrated what the sport was really about for him--dominance pain and survival. Caught up in his own sense of betrayal (the referees didnt call a foul against Holyfield in either fight) he inadvertently reminded many people of something that they may not have been eager to admit--that they were drawn to the game in the first place by the spectacle of blood. Movies aestheticize violence; an actual fight brings out the desire to see men destroy each other. Perhaps we moviegoers relishing violence occasionally need to see how crazy the real thing can be. Those who were furious at Tyson will be made even angrier by Tobacks film for here is a fresh provocation--an attempt to restore to Tyson the human dimensions that have been taken from him (by himself of course as well as by others). The movie makes it clear that for all his snarls and outbursts he is intelligent candid and easily wounded; that he is by turns inordinately proud and inordinately ashamed and above all intensely curious about himself as if his own nature were a mystery that had not yet been solved. Out of shape his face bizarrely marked by the tentacle-like tattoos of a Maori warrior Tyson was forty when the movie was shot two years ago mostly in the luxurious white living room of a house in Los Angeles that was rented for the occasion. In between footage of his fights he looks directly into the camera in tight closeup or is photographed from the side also very close a Cubist approach to portraiture that suggests a complicated man trying to express warring impulses. Some of these contradictions are funny as when Tyson says that he now wants a strong woman very strong a C.E.O. type--""and then I want to dominate her sexually."" Even at bay he must conquer in all things. Toback having known Tyson for years may have helped him shape his memories into a menacing American fable. Fatherless his mother an alcoholic Tyson grew up in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn a fat kid with a high lisping voice who was an easy mark for vicious older boys. As a kind of revenge he became a baby gangster who robbed drug dealers. In detention in upstate New York he passed into the hands of Bobby Stewart a retired fighter who sent him at the age of fourteen to the great trainer Cus DAmato. DAmato both indulged him as a lawless teen and disciplined him as a fighter and he inculcated in him the DAmato doctrine a way of transforming anger into a relentless attack in which speed and strength--a hail of full-power punches--drive through an opponents defenses. As Tyson tells it his old humiliations fuelled the strategy. Before a fight he was frightened of losing but as he approached the ring fear would ebb. In the movies most powerful sequence we hear Tyson narrate his fear-management ritual as he climbs into the ring his pupils darting this way and that following an opponents movements. The deaths-head face he presented to the other fighter--cobra eyes and flattened cheekbones--was a mask designed to intimidate. He bore in and the men collapsed like stunned cattle often in the first or second round. Perhaps Tyson was fortunate to have avoided school and society inasmuch as his grim early years were the only background that could have produced the inexorable force that he became. What this early life couldnt do however was protect him from the many dangers outside the ring. Without the guidance of DAmato (who died when Tyson was nineteen) he fell among idolaters and users and blew tens of millions of dollars as he admits on houses cars clothes girls drugs parties every kind of excess to the point where the man who was once the wealthiest fighter in history winds up beached (literally--Toback photographs him facing the sea) stranded amid debts and visits to rehab clinics. In that long descent Tyson acted out his sense of worthlessness. If he cannot be king he will be nothing; the middle he says doesnt suit his temperament. What he offers Tobacks camera now is savagery recollected in tranquillity--the baddest man becalmed into a state of articulate self-awareness. That victory at least no one can take away from him.

By Peter Rainer May 1 2009 Save for later Saved Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? If you have been slavering for the lowdown on how the Wolverine became the Wolverine this is your moment. In the helpfully titled ""X-Men Origins Wolverine"" the fourth installment in the ""X-Men"" franchise Hugh Jackman demonstrates that you can segue effortlessly from a tuxedoed song-and-dance man at the Oscars to a feral gent with adamantium claws and ""berserker rage.""How does all this play out for those of us - i.e. me - who have not been staying up nights fretting over the origins of the X-Men and Women? The answer is Fairly well. The movie set mostly in the 1970s follows Wolverine and his even more feral brother Sabretooth (Liev Schreiber) from their young pup days through combat in the Civil War World War I World War II and Vietnam. (Apparently they skipped Korea.) And thats just in the first 10 minutes. They discover early on that they are essentially unkillable which attracts the attention of Col. William Stryker (Danny Huston playing the role essayed in ""X2"" by Brian Cox) a smarmy US military honcho who enlists the wolfish ones in a covert ops team of fellow mutants. Bad things ensue but rest assured by movies end Wolverine has his claws if not his memory intact.

Of course hes not Wolverine yet. Hes a sickly kid named James who inadvertently discovers a way to get better when his dad is killed in a scuffle with a neighbor James hears a gunshot leaps from bed to find his dad lying in a pool of blood and suddenly hes seething -- and not at all sickly anymore. Huge bony claws sprout from his knuckles much to the apparent surprise of everyone but his brother Victor -- who helps him run away after James kills the guy who killed their father. ""Were brothers"" says Victor helpfully. ""We stick together no matter what. Now keep running and dont look back."" And run they do right out of childhood and into matching sideburns into the bodies of Liev Schreiber and Hugh Jackman and into a big war montage. The Civil War World War I World War II Vietnam -- both of them stay perpetually angry for a century and a half though you would think theyd be delighted to have stopped aging in their mid-30s. Sometime after Vietnam a government tool named Stryker (Danny Huston) gets involved and while Victor adopts the name Sabretooth and goes on a killing spree James proves he is really Mr. Mild by moving to Canada becoming a lumberjack and hitching up with a beautiful girlfriend (Lynn Collins) who tells him stories about wolverines baying at the moon. Naturally that cant last. And after some thoroughly unmotivated carnage James says ""Yes"" to an adamantium transfusion. Youd think this would turn him into British rock star Adam Ant; instead Stryker tells him it will bond metal to his bones and make him the ultimate fighting machine -- indestructible. Naturally its only after hes become indestructible that it occurs to anyone that Wolvie is not the most manageable guy. And the rest of the movie is an attempt to neutralize him while citing every comic-book-origin cliche in the Marvel playbook. When he escapes Strykers adamantium lab for instance he holes up with farmers who are such dead ringers for Spider-Mans Aunt May and Uncle Ben you half expect a radioactive spider to bite our hero in their hayloft. And when his friends die as friends of superheroes are wont to do in origin stories he does that head-back howling thing with the camera ascending above him as ... well as grieving superheroes are wont to do. Wolverine also has to deal with a lot of what I started thinking of as mutationally challenged mutants -- one is um ... well really hes just rather fat while another does card tricks -- before being isolated with his various antagonists in a spot where no one will interfere as they hurl special effects at one another. You know all those movies where people get sent to an island somewhere and then discover that everybody is a clone or a nuclear reactor is melting down or crazed killers are on the loose? Well imagine all of that happening at once only everybody is indestructible because they all have to make more movies and you have X-Men Origins Wolverine. The most terrifying thing about the movie really is that plural Originsssss. So many mutants so much time. Thank God we can leave that for another summer.

X-Men Origins Wolverine. (PG-13) Fox (108 min.) Directed by Gavin Hood. With Hugh Jackman Liev Schreiber. Opening at midnight Thursday in New Jersey. TWO AND A HALF STARS. ""X-Men Origins Wolverine"" is a prequel to and a bit of a re-boot for the popular franchise about powerful cranky flawed mutants -- and the other mutants who love them. But its story feels slightly malformed itself. If its truly an ""Origins"" tale as advertised -- well where are the explanations? When we meet baby Wolverine hes already on the cusp of mutating -- and has a secret half-brother Sabretooth. But why are they mutants? And such different ones? And being raised apart and in ignorance of their parentage? The story never answers that which some diehard fans might brush aside in their rush to get to the good stuff. But neither does the script justify why Sabretooth becomes Wolverines sworn enemy (or not depending on the demands of the plot). And other basic elements -- like why another perfectly harmless mutant is murdered early on -- never become clear. Before the Marvel maniacs rise up in revolt -- too late perhaps -- let me tell you I enjoy a good comic-book movie. And pay no attention to that rough bootleg you might have seen on the internet; the finished ""Wolverine"" has plenty of eye candy and fine Hong-Kong-style stunts. But the sophisticated ironies of ""Iron Man""? The human drama of the first ""Spider-Man""? The coal-black touches of ""The Dark Knight"" or even the overreaching ambitions of ""Watchmen""? Those arent here. They dont have to be in every superhero movie of course -- no one looked for deeper meaning in ""Fantastic Four."" But ""X-Men"" always had a political resonance to it reflecting on racial prejudice at the comics debut and by the time of the first film suggesting a metaphor for gay rights. But theres no context or subtext here -- outside of U.S. military bad mutants cool. Hugh Jackman returns as Wolverine of course and takes up a second job as one of the producers -- which resulted in a shorter commuting time for him (the new film was mostly shot in Australia and New Zealand instead of Canada) and his choice of Gavin Hood for director. The first must have been convenient (although if you believe Jackman the location change was because of his ""desire to be challenged""); the second was a bad decision. Hoods few films include the small-scale ""Tsotsi"" and the painfully obvious flop ""Rendition""; he shows no visual sense of place or period here. Nor does he show any interest in reining in the pumped-up Jackman who spends much of his time either howling up at the sky (while the camera dizzily pulls back) or muscularly running away from conflagrations (while things blow up behind him). Luckily you have the rest of the cast -- particularly Liev Schreiber as Sabretooth Wolverines brooding nemesis. Of course the script never makes their animosity plausible so Schreiber -- the best actor on board -- has to do the job all himself. Luckily hes up to it creating a monster of bottomless brooding and endless unmotivated malice. Hes like Iago with claws. Ryan Reynolds is good too as the swordsman Wade Wilson and as Agent Zero Daniel Henney pulls off some of the kind of gunplay Chow Yun-Fat used to. (Only Taylor Kitsch sadly disappoints as Gambit coming off as a second-rate magician.) So does the film succeed overall? On some levels. After two flops it gives Jackman a much-needed moneymaker. It gives Fox -- always a franchise-oriented studio -- another series. (Although really how many other X-Men deserve their own origins story?) And it gives rabid Wolverine fans another episode. And if you dont match any of those demographics? And all you want is a guilt-free sci-fi summer pleasure? Save your money and wait another week. The crew of the Enterprise is on its way. Ratings note The film contains violence and brief nudity. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Alpha hero Wolverine is all sinew and muscle. And there are enough shots of Hugh Jackmans taut physique -- including one of him streaking into a barn -- to prove it. He also has a prickly sense of ethics. His conflicted nature is what makes the cigar-chomping renegade the most fascinating of the X-Men and the most deserving of breakout treatment. Now if only the script for ""X-Men Origins Wolverine"" were as sharp as our heros new ""adamantium"" claws. Instead summers first tent-pole flick is a dulled outing. It may assuage the die-hard fan but its doggedly routine. Too bad. Jackman really is game to make this vehicle vroom. So is Liev Schreiber who plays Wolverines brother Victor or as hes known by comic aficionados Sabretooth. We meet the characters in the mid-1800s. John (who later becomes Logan/Wolverine) and Victor know each other well. They dont know of their blood ties until tragedy seals their -- if not a bond -- fates. The boys grow into men the men into warriors. Each has feral mutations that make him nearly indestructible and a brave manicurists dream. In an extended battle montage the brothers fight in a series of wars the Civil War World War I and World War II. By the time they hover in a chopper above Vietnam Logans face registers increasing awareness that Victors embrace of violence courses deep and dangerous. Logan parts ways with his brother and the mercenary team headed by Stryker (Danny Huston). He finds his way to the Canadian Rockies and makes a life with an ultra-perceptive schoolteacher named Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins). Huston has become the go-to guy for casting agents in need of a smug villain. Strykers got his own twisted history and dark theories about mutants. His team includes Victor and Logan as well as other marvels of the lethal arts among them Wade Wilson (a chattery Ryan Reynolds) teleporter Wraith (Will.i.am) and Fred J. Dukes (Kevin Durand) who later metamorphoses for an easy fat gag into the Blob. If Stryker exploits his understanding of the mutants burden (""I know you"" is his come-on) Kayla actually recognizes Logan and does one better providing him the name Wolverine. Still like Michael Corleone Logan gets out of the racket only to be dragged back into it. With its theme of the damaged and dangerous warrior ""Wolverine"" aims to say deeper things -- about war soldiers even post-traumatic stress disorder. Only it cant find a way to balance those desires with its popcorn reflexes. Because the mix has been done -- and how -- most recently by ""Watchmen"" and before that by the PG-13- rated ""The Dark Knight"" this is a failure not of genre but of filmmaking. One of the things so appealing about Wolverine and Jackmans embodiment of him is his ambivalence about his gift. Is it talent tool or curse? This dilemma about the uses or abuses of power makes Gavin Hood a savvy choice for director. After all the South African has made two involving films about violence and its repercussions Oscar-winning ""Tsotsi"" about an urban gangsta who softens some when he discovers an infant in the car hes jacked and 2007s ""Rendition."" His American debut about the spiriting away of terror suspects to undisclosed locations for enhanced interrogation wasnt a box-office hit by any means. But it was a fine reckoning rife with good performances with the moral burden of such an undertaking. Hoods gift for complexity is muted. Perhaps its worth remembering that the wolverine is not from the wolf family. Instead the solitary tenacious mammal that resembles a small bear is from the weasel family. Each time ""Wolverine"" approaches the dark night of our heros soul it weasels out of its ambitions with the bad habits of lesser flicks the tinkling of glass shattering the resounding thunder of explosions the none- too-special effects of bloodless violence.

Its the suggestion that there are lots of X-Men and each one has an origin and that this is just the first of a potentially endless series of X-Men movies -- each one doing what this one does boring audiences with go-nowhere action sequences while dazzling the mind with zingy repartee such as ""Well well well Look what the cat dragged in"" Think An actor didnt just say that. First a screenwriter had to write it. He had to delve inside and search for something clever tearing up reams of paper in the process just the way writers do in movies. Then finally the sun bursts through the clouds in the form of ""Well well well Look what the cat dragged in"" When a line like that makes it to the final cut -- when a respectable director like Gavin Hood (Tsotsi Rendition) and his screenwriters start coming through the door with soggy chewed up half-dead cliches to drop at your feet -- that tells you something. It tells you no one was minding the store probably because there were much bigger problems to attend to. In X-Men Origins Wolverine there are multiple fight scenes with virtually identical choreography special effects that look straight out of a computer and a parade of mutant heroes with gimmicky powers each one of whom gets his drawn-out chance to shine like the individual dancers in A Chorus Line. Credit the director for one thing. He could have stretched it to three hours but he gets in and out of this mess in less than two. Wolverineis supposedly a comic book movie and yet it violates one of the tenets of comic books. It doesnt delineate and particularize Wolverines special powers. In an opening sequence we find out that he was born some time around 1840 and with his buddy (and possible brother Victor) he fought in almost every American war that followed starting with the Civil War. In each war Wolverine and Victor (Liev Schreiber) get killed (bad luck) but each time they spring back to life. Yet suffocating underneath all the blustering and posturing noise and heavy-handed graphics is a shred of something interesting. Wolverine and Victor are recruited by a Colonel Stryker (Danny Huston) as part of an elite mutant unit. Their task? To round up and kill fellow mutants. So immediately theres the clash -- between Wolverines allegiance to his government and his affection for and emerging identification with his own people. Unable to go on he leaves the military and does what any self-respecting mutant would do under the circumstances He moves to Canada because thats how Americans think of Canada after all -- as identical to the United States but with no problems. Jackman has a peculiar film career. He seems determined to be the handsomest man in some of the worst movies of his era although in Wolverine those good looks are obscured under a demeanor of humorlessness and strain and a hairstyle that evokes mid-period Eddie Munster. Any beefy actor could have played Victor but the sight of Schreiber with fangs depressed me -- this is where our talent goes now. On a happier note Danny Huston is this decades J.T. Walsh the best white-collar villain in movies -- and he survives. And Lynne Collins in one of her first important roles in a major picture leaves an impression of probity and loveliness as Wolverines girlfriend who is so nice and so clear-headed and so fundamentally decent that the minute she comes onscreen every viewer turns into an amateur life insurance actuary.

Comments X-Men Origins Wolverine The zillion-grossing X-Men franchise shifts into prequel mode singling out the series breakout star Hugh Jackman and most popular character the walking letter opener Wolverine. The most interesting part of his genesis story races by in the first reel after his superpowers emerge Wolverine and his similarly equipped brother (Liev Schreiber) immortally kick ass in one American conflict after another (from the Civil War to Vietnam) before a slimy defense contractor (Danny Huston) recruits them for a secret paramilitary squad. Repulsed by the outfits ruthlessness Wolverine bails and finds happiness with a young honey in the Canadian Rockies but his old pals come looking for him. Jackmans committed performance keeps the movie on track though Huston and Schreiber are strictly on autopilot. Gavin Hood (Tsotsi) directed; with Ryan Reynolds and rapper will.i.am. PG-13 107 min.

As a man James alias Logan a.k.a. Wolverine has a gigantic torso and bulging veins; he might be a late-90s home-run hitter after a visit to BALCO. And since hes Hugh Jackman hes blessed with the winsome stare of a beautiful boy who mistakenly thinks hes done wrong. Anyway he looks great for someone whos about 160 years old. Hes also carrying a ton of psychic baggage. Back in 1845 he killed his father with fingernails that sprouted into steel claws when he became enraged. And if he doesnt know then we do that he already starred in three X-Men movies dating back to 2000. So Logan/James/Wolverine/Hugh is both nine years older than he was at the beginning of the series but also 20 to 50 to 100 years younger. Superhero mythologies can be so complicated only a lonely comic-book-reading kid could make sense of it all. (Are graphic novels Hollywoods new gold mine?) The appeal of so many of the fables Stan Lee and his colleagues have spun out for Marvel Comics is their confirmation of what any young reader may have thought about himself as his body changes and his mind reels Im a freak. To this Lee adds the fantasy But your weirdness is a sign of preternatural abilities; youre odd because youre a hero. Spider-Man emits goo from his fingers and he can fly. The Hulk gets mad and becomes bigger and stronger. Wolverines Dragon Lady fingernails make him the toughest guy on the block. Its the outsiders ultimate dream. Use whats different the Marvel gurus teach their readers and you could get your own comic-book franchise. See the worlds most influential people in the 2009 TIME 100. X-Men Origins Wolverine is an O.K. not great Marvel movie that tells the early story of the prime X-Man and attempts to make it climax in a perfect coupling with the start of the known trilogy. In doing so the film tears off a bit more than it can devour. The whole enterprise now spans a century and a half runs backward and forward in time and expands the number of characters in the mythology so theyll get their own prequels and sequels. Marvel you see is working on another Origins take Magneto about the early lives of Eric Lensherr (who in the trilogy was played as a middle-aged man by Ian McKellen) and Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart who makes a guest appearance here). Its not surprising then that the movie has the harried feel of a personnel officer with too many people to manage too many plates to keep spinning. Wolverine lacks the simple narrative drive and character pizzazz of Iron Man the Marvel movie that launched last years summer blockbuster season. Its 1845 and James and his elder half-brother Victor (Liev Schreiber) are fleeing the Northwest Territories itching for a fight. Canada has plenty of brawling hockey players but not nearly enough bloody conflicts so the lads head to the Lower 48 to fight in the Civil War both World Wars and Vietnam. Logan can channel his aggressions into wartime heroism; Victor just likes killing and maiming people. Its a little twist on the role of the stern violent brother Schreiber played in Defiance a few months back except this time hes got fangs and great big claws and his enemies arent Nazis but anyone weaker than he -- which is just about everyone possibly including his baby sib. (Hollywood sequels everything old is gold again) Every action movie needs an evil overseer to harness exploit and misuse the heros reckless powers. In Wolverine its a U.S. Army colonel Stryker (Danny Huston) who recruits the Howlett boys for his top-secret platoon of misfits each with a special skill. The dirty half-dozen includes to ID them by their nicknames Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) Gambit (Taylor Kitsch) Agent Zero (Daniel Henney) Bolt (Dominic Monaghan) and the Blob (Kevin Durand). Logan sensing Strykers evil-genius motives is reluctant to join the gang. ""Your country needs you"" Stryker pleads to which Logan replies ""Im Canadian."" A misfit again. Going AWOL from the team Logan returns to his roots and becomes a Canadian lumberjack with an indigenous girlfriend (the beguiling Lynn Collins who has played Ophelia and Juliet and knows how to telegraph troubled love). He should know he cannot escape his roiled physical and psychological destiny; there aint no sanity claws. Soon hes drawn back into the orbit of Stryker whose plan is to pour adamantium into Logans system giving our boy the power to fight and destroy his murderous bro. ""Were going to make you indestructible"" Stryker says in one of his many generic Dr. Frankenstein lines. ""But first we have to destroy you."" And then they have to face him off against a newer nastier mutant Reynolds now retooled into a true Frankenstein monster. Written by novelist David Benioff and Skip Woods Wolverine was directed by Gavin Hood a South African who earlier made two exercises in political solemnity Tsotsi and Rendition. The new movie has a sharper look and a smarter film sense because Hood is surrounded by the sort of artist-technicians who can lend cinematic swank to almost any action picture. But thats now par for the course and Wolverine doesnt rise above the level of familiar competence. What holds it together is Jackman an actor who suggests the decency that is meant to be at the core of his character. As Logan struggles to tame his Hulk-like temper so Jackman works to fit his friendly temperate persona into the action-film superhero mold. The Australian star who first came to prominence in a London revival of Oklahoma just is not a natural glowerer. His benign showmanship hints that what Wolverine is likely to explode into at any moment is not a homicidal rage but a rendition of ""Oh What a Beautiful Mornin"" Which could cue a new Hollywood hybrid Wolverine The Musical anyone?

That version - dubbed a workprint by the studio but reportedly similar to the completed cut barring a few effects shots - has already received a drubbing from those brave enough to admit to having watched it. So how does the finished film stand up?The plot is thin and largely culled from an established backstory that anyone whos seen X2 will be familiar with. After unwittingly murdering his father young Logan runs away to a life of war and turmoil deathless and indestructible Wolverine and his brother Victor aka Sabretooth (Liev Schreiber) are eventually recruited by Danny Hustons black-ops expert General Stryker for a series of covert missions. But surveillance quickly turns to slaughter and Logan turns his back on the military. Unfortunately - and predictably - it turns out the military isnt close to finished with him.On the plus side Hugh Jackman is hugely likeable in a role he was born to play slicing and dicing his way through a series of competent action sequences devised by Rendition and Tsotsi director Gavin Hood. The opening mapping Wolverines journey through a century of warfare is epic breathless and brilliant. But the script is simply disastrous. Overloaded with murky forgettable characters familiar only to fans of the comics its shot through with both narrative inconsistencies and laughably functional dialogue. A host of talented supporting players including Liev Schreiber and Ryan Reynolds are unforgivably wasted while crude visual references to both Watchmen and The Lord of the Rings only highlight the films failed ambitions. With some dire blue-screen effects dizzying tonal instability and a total absence of suspense or originality Wolverine is something of a disaster.

Its not that these were similar shots they were EXACTLY IDENTICAL. Cheesy sunset hero shots. The movie was high school good. it was a spit in the face of xmen fans everywhere....but we should be used to that by now.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 29 2009chadFeaturedandy just because you dont like it does not make it wrong for other people to like it. and ooooo girls like it tut tut....so? doesnt have to be an oscar award winnerfor people to like it...good filmFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 29 2009chadFeaturedandy just because you dont like it does not make it wrong for other people to like it. and ooooo girls like it tut tut....so? doesnt have to be an oscar award winnerfor people to like it...good filmFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 28 2009gingermingerFeaturedi dont know weather to see this or a thriller what do you suggestFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 28 2009gingermingerFeaturedi dont know weather to see this or a thriller what do you suggestFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 26 2009andyFeaturedpeople that like this movie are the reason hollywood keeps putting this shit out. because you all buy into it. if you like this movie you know nothing about good storytelling or good film making. i find it funny how every female review loves this film. probably bc you cant stop looking at ""hunky"" hugh jackman. who by the way i no longer enjoy as wolverine. he has made wolverine passive and wimpy. he is no longer savage and primal. hes a pretty boy now. thats not wolverine. hollywood is taking you all for suckers. and guess what you are letting them.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 25 2009boodlepopFeaturedlove it towards the end gets a bit cheesey but other than that...love itFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 25 2009boodlepopFeaturedlove it towards the end gets a bit cheesey but other than that...love itFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 25 2009jamesFeaturedA quality film ) definatly worth seeingFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 25 2009jamesFeaturedA quality film ) definatly worth seeingFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 24 2009cee-jayFeaturedif you have to choose between this and Famp;F go see X_Men and for all you sad sacks whove never read a comic book in your life - fear the menopause - cause its coming to getchaFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 24 2009cee-jayFeaturedif you have to choose between this and Famp;F go see X_Men and for all you sad sacks whove never read a comic book in your life - fear the menopause - cause its coming to getchaFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 22 2009rashFeaturedthe reason this been rated sht its because the 90s x-men cartoon series had a better storylineFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 15 2009annomyisFeaturedWhy have u guys who thouight it was shit put loads if stars I goin to watch it with my boyfriend and I think its gonna be awesomeFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 15 2009annomyisFeaturedWhy have u guys who thouight it was shit put loads if stars I goin to watch it with my boyfriend and I think its gonna be awesomeFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 14 2009TristanFeaturedgreat start to a movie...and excellent storyFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 14 2009TristanFeaturedgreat start to a movie...and excellent storyFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 13 2009lyndon minorFeaturedThe film had a good story and was well linked to the previous xmen films it should be rated 4 stars some people have no tasteFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 12 2009samFeaturedIf you go into this movie expecting it to be ""good"" then youre an idiot. It was obvious from previews and seeing other marvel renditions that this wasnt going to be intellectual acurate or have any oscar nominations. So people who go on saying this movie sucked...why would they really think otherwise. Its a summer action movie with superheroes. Thats all that was intended. It wasnt great. I grew up on comics know the wolverine story in and out and saw all the discrepencies. However you do see a character who is wolverine-like tearing things up. The action was fun and i came out wishing i had some claws like i was 10 again. So just sit back enjoy and dont stress about the quality of the movie because honestly thats never what this movie was about.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 12 2009NaoFeaturedTerrible. TERRIBLE. But this is coming from a huge Marvel fan. If you have no idea how this movie SHOULD have been made youll love it but if you know how the stories and characters should be youll hate it to hell. Some characters they made powers up for and then gave them the name of known heroes - Especially Deadpool. What the hell Fox. What the hell.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 11 2009The HawkFeaturedSuch a major disappointment... Forgive the pun but to give credit where its due the opening title sequence is great It really gives you the sense that a troublesome relationship with some real emotional investment is developing between 2 brothers (who arent brothers really in the comics) Why does Stan Lee continuously allow his universe to be pillaged? Another very disappointing Marvel adaptation - I never really liked any of the XMEN films as they all lack intelligent stories and are too pop. I enjoyed Spiderman 2. Wolverine is possibly among the worst of a bad bunch right down there with Elektra and Dare Devil. The last half hour is laughable. The film is generally upsetting - I was really looking forward to this one. Oh well maybe next time...FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 10 2009MissyFeaturedthe film was amazing love wolverine best x-men film enough saidFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 10 2009MissyFeaturedthe film was amazing love wolverine best x-men film enough saidFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 10 2009StormFeaturedWhat is wrong with some of you people? This movie was terrible. It has nothing to do with any connection to the comic; it was just a bad movie. The dialogue was weak. The acting talent was completely wasted. Where was Ryan Reynolds? What was that ridiculous action sequence at the end? None of the characters were really explored except for Wolverine.

How Marvel allows this to happen to such a popular and longstanding character as Wolverine is beyond me. This character who John Byrne and Chris Clairemont and then countless other talented writers have turned slowly into one of the best comic book characters of all times is completely sold out inside of 3 minutes in this film. Nothing against Hugh Jackman but the only thing that resembles Wolverine on that guy is his face - and since when was he the same size as Sabertooth? And what about his covert asian background? The adamantimum transformation was one of the most physically traumatic experiences of the characters life and yet the movie treats it like he got a filling at the dentist. And WTF was Deadpool about? Why even go there? Did the film need it? Why didnt we at least get the Sabertooth we saw in the X-Men movies? And why use Cyclops in that way? And what was with the totally forgettable girlfriend? I thought what Spidey 3 did to the Gwen Stacey character was a travesty but this takes the cake. As a lifelong Wolverine fan this movie was deeply disappointing if not downright insulting to the franchise had little if anything to do with the character as written and should be swept under the mythos carpet ASAP. Boo people Just boo. Sad follow up to Iron Man - why reconstruct characters that have already stood the test of time across such a huge fanbase? This was obviously more about the money than about any commitment to the Wolverine character. This movie just sucked bigtime PLEASE MARVEL - MORE IRON MAN QUALITY AND LESS OF THIS INSULTING CRAP WHY DO YOU THINK THESE CHARACTERS ARE POPULAR?? I want my money back. I only put one star because that was the minumum - personally Id give this one a -3.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 3 2009Michael LaingFeaturedThis film is not good. The script is awful I wrote better stories when I was 4 Apart from one or two one liners the dialogue is sub par the story rediculous charactor building is pretty much forgotten the story clunks along form one fight scene to the next (more about the fight stuff later. The diecting and cinematography is uninspired and pretty amateurish. The ation scenes are about as exciting as watching socks dry. I have seen it all done before and better in count;ess other film. I hate fast cutting anyway especially in action scene (it can work in some films Bourne being a good example) but here it is done badly and combined with the ropey wire work and below standard special effects. Due to the script most of the actors are given very little to work with. I can only think of one good one liner and that comes from Liev Schreiber Creed charactor. Hugh Jackman may look good but isnt given anyfthing decent to say and isnt given a chance to develop the characterr. Ryan Reynolds is given nothing to do with Deadpool and the he just isnt funny. I must admit to being a big deadpool fan and really hated that they did to him (why do movies have to change successful charactors so much and turn them into dog droppings). Taylor Kitsch is ok as Gambit but it feels as if he has just been added in for the sake of getting another popular character on screen The music for the film was ok but kept getting over melodramatic which isnt helped by the complete disinterest in the charactrrs which means the score is wasted and became annoying after a while This film is a huge mess. I dont think a film should be made badly just because it is a action or comic book film I like good action films but this film fails in almost every respect. If you want a good x men film go and watch X2 which is much better. If you want a good Marvel film watch Blade 2 or Iron man. If you want to see a good superhero film go and watch the matrix or last 2 batman films which is superior in every way.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 2 2009BelleFeaturedAre you guys out of your mind? You know X Men Origins Wolverine was intensively illusive and action based all the way throughout the film.

"X-Men Origins Wolverine | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; x-men-origins-wolverine ) X-Men Origins Wolverine (United States 2009) April 30 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli 2008 was the year in which the comic book superhero came of age. Films like Iron Man and especially The Dark Knight illustrated what was possible when a motion picture dared to take its characters out of the comfortable box in which too many superhero franchises reside. Wolverine the fourth in the X-Men series ignores the gains made by the genre during the past year. Although neither unwatchable nor inept this movie is generic and uninspired. Its a B-list story masquerading as an A-list title. Its the kind of thing that based on concept and screenplay alone would have been more at home with an early spring or late autumn release rather than batting leadoff for 2009s roster of summer blockbusters. When it comes to superhero tales the two least appealing types are origin stories and prequels. Wolverine has the double disadvantage of being both. And although it can take credit for clearing up some of the mysteries surround the title characters identity those revelations serve to make Wolverine less compelling. What was mystique in the X-Men trilogy has now been reduced to formula. Perhaps the problem isnt that the movie answers questions but that theres little creativity evident in the way those blanks are filled in. For those who demand little more than a string of loosely connected action sequences from a superhero movie Wolverine provides what is desired. The film doesnt spend a lot of time on exposition or character development showing a form of attention deficit disorder that demands no more than ten minutes elapse between one fight or chase and the next. The prequel problem results in an anticlimax. Since two of the villains have significant roles in the X-Men trilogy theres not a lot of suspense about their prospects for survival. We also know Wolverines forgettable fate so the only open question is how it happens. Wolverine opens in Canadas Northwest Territories in 1845 and introduces us to mutant half-brothers Logan and Victor who go on the run to help Logan avoid a murder charge. An opening credits montage shows them fighting in various conflicts the Civil War both World Wars and Vietnam. During the 70s the two of them (played as adults by Hugh Jackman and Liev Schreiber) are recruited by army honcho William Stryker (Danny Huston) who is assembling an elite team. When Strykers methods become too brutal for Logan to countenance he breaks from the group and retreats to a remote part of Canada where he works as a logger and lives with his lover Kayla (Lynn Collins). But Logans past pursues him and it catches him in the form of Stryker and Victor who has become disillusioned by what he believes to be his brothers betrayal and abandonment. Although the action scenes are competently executed theres nothing here to raise the pulse. The battle atop the nuclear cooling tower for example pales when compared to the kinetic runaway train sequence in Spider-Man 2 or even the smash-mania at the end of last years The Incredible Hulk. Theres nothing in Wolverine that stands out as memorable - no signature sequence that will put this movie on the superhero map. Admittedly director Gavin Hood has no experience dealing with a big budget production of this nature and he was reportedly aided by Richard Donner but the problem is less an issue of how the scenes were choreographed than in their inherent banality. The film does its best to remind us that its intended to be an integral part of the X-Men saga rather than a disconnected appendage. Parts of the ending are forced into a lead-in position for the original X-Men. Theres a jarring cameo. Numerous ""familiar faces"" from the other movies make appearances - Cyclops Sabretooth Stryker - but all are played by different actors. Wolverine pays lip service to the most complex and intriguing aspect of X-Men mythology - the political and cultural struggle between humans and mutants - but its more of a plot device than an integral element. Stryker in fact was deeper and better motivated in X2 when Brian Cox portrayed him than he is here. The bright spots are provided by actors Hugh Jackman and Liev Schreiber. Having made three previous appearances as the character Jackman has an excellent feel for Wolverine and that familiarity illuminates his performance. Jackman takes the role seriously and puts as much effort into this movie as he might into a more serious-minded production. Liev Schreiber is a top-notch foil. He snarls and growls his way through the film with A(c)lan and his delivery of one-liners is perfect (or nearly so). Schreiber effortlessly steals scenes from Jackman and both actors stand head-and-shoulders above everyone else. Danny Huston makes the interesting choice of not going over-the-top with Stryker. As villains go this makes him a little colorless and personality-deprived. Wolverine had a troubled production history which might explain its inconsistent tone and sloppy ending. As previously mentioned Richard Donner was recruited by Fox to ""advise"" Hood on some of the more challenging action scenes. (Accounts about the degree of this ""advice"" vary based on who is discussing it - some claim that Donner took over the center chair.) Re-shoots were necessary. And there was the infamous Internet leak of a work print. Publicity-wise Wolverine has been overshadowed by some of the summers later releases. Nevertheless superhero movies are big business and this is 2009s lone established comic book franchise sequel. In terms of tone and content Wolverine is a nearer match to Daredevil than Iron Man but its box office gross will undoubtedly be closer to the latter. Marvel Comics movies have a history of ""opening"" the summer; this is one occasion when the splash may be bigger than the material warrants.

"Review Wolverine doesnt cut it - CNN.com Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon Review Wolverine doesnt cut itStory Highlights ""X-Men Origins Wolverine"" has all the drawbacks none of heart of comic-book film Film has wonderful CGI effects but to what end? Star Hugh Jackman tries hard but script pacing let him down Next Article in Entertainment >> By Tom Charity Special to CNN (CNN) -- Actors call it ""backstory."" Hugh Jackman stars as the title character in ""X-Men Origins Wolverine."" Its all the stuff that happened in the past before the movie begins. All the stuff that might explain how the character became what he or she is today. Its obvious why that might be fascinating to the actor playing the role. But as for the rest of us well you have to figure the writer left it out for a reason. But these days were seeing a lot more ""origin"" stories as the studios milk each franchise for every last drop and thus arrives ""X-Men Origins Wolverine"" about the blade-wielding character Hugh Jackman plays. (Jackman no dummy has a producer credit on the film.) You can be sure that someone at Twentieth Century Fox will be running the numbers Monday with a view to fast-tracking a sequel to this prequel as well as further putative episodes devoted to Jean Grey Cyclops Storm Mystique and the rest of the class of X. Based on ""Wolverine"" its hard to get excited about the prospect. The film exhibits all the overly familiar hallmarks of the 21st-century comic book movie an inflated sense of its own importance turgid plotting and action sequences designed to showcase lavish CGI effects. In many ways it was the first ""X-Men"" back in 2000 that set the tone. On the one hand director Bryan Singer embedded an earnest allegory about prejudice and minority rights; on the other it was an FX geeks wet dream. Each mutant came with her or his own gimmick One could shapeshift; another could levitate; yet another had a bad case of wind. The mutants all shared the same nasty temper but Logan/Wolverine (Jackman) had the shortest fuse -- and the silliest haircut a 50s ducktail with ferocious rockabilly sideburns. Predictably enough ""Origins"" devotes more time to exploring the roots of his anger issues than his hair but it doesnt worry about where his most distinctive genetic features might have come from the retractable claws that spring from his knuckles when hes irked and his invulnerability to anything short of decapitation. In ""Wolverine"" Logan has lost his taste for war in Vietnam after more than a century as a fighting man (or mutant) and finally walks away in disgust from the elite mutant unit put together by Col. Stryker (Danny Huston). But his brother Victor (Liev Schreiber) has other ideas and knows how to get Wolverine to embrace his true animalistic nature. Borrowing wholesale from ""The Incredible Hulk"" with Schreiber fairly effective in the Abomination part ""Wolverine"" struggles to establish an identity of its own. The two brothers charge at each other like medieval knights jousting and Victor -- also known as Sabretooth -- affects a dog-like four-legged bound. But no matter how often he tries it director Gavin Hood (""Tsotsi"") never works out how to make a fight between indestructible foes tense or exciting. Thats the trouble with CG-enhanced action What you gain in spectacle you lose in impact. Filmmakers today can engineer destruction on a scale that would have been unimaginable 20 or 30 years ago but its all so much collateral damage. Its rare these days for an American action movie to impart any genuine sense of pain or hurt or loss. Too much Wow not enough Ow In fairness there are fleeting moments in ""Wolverine"" where we do feel Logans emotional anguish. But theyre only as a prelude to his anger which is the only quality an audience is likely to find interesting about him. Serviceable but inescapably redundant this ""Wolverine"" movie does just enough to keep the ""X-Men"" franchise on life support but the filmmakers will have to come up with some evolutionary changes soon if its going to escape X-tinction. ""X-Men Origins Wolverine"" is rated PG-13 and runs 108 minutes. For Entertainment Weeklys review click here.

"X-Men Origins Wolverine A hairy Canuck Obama? | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsX-Men Origins Wolverine A hairy Canuck Obama?So much time is expended on the origin part that theres not much left by way of saving the planet from the bad guy du jour.Logan (Hugh Jackman) and Victor Creed (Liev Schreiber) face off for the ultimate battle - in X-Men Origins Wolverine.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. April 30 2009 X-Men Origins Wolverine (out of 4)Starring Hugh Jackman Liev Schreiber Danny Huston Ryan Reynolds and Lynn Collins. Directed by Gavin Hood. 107 minutes. At major theatres midnight screenings start tonight. PG Yes Virginia there is a sanity claws.Let geeks and lawyers scratch their eyes out over whether the official X-Men Origins Wolverine arriving at theatres tonight is substantially different from the advance print leaked to the Internet.Both prints reportedly clock in at 107 minutes so draw your own conclusions. But a far more intelligent and worthwhile pursuit is to view this otherwise silly and slap-happy superhero saga as a metaphor for the ongoing power shift stateside from the Bush/Cheney hawks to the Obama doves. It will help those 107 minutes pass swiftly and keep brain cells from dying.Youve got your Bush/Cheney cabal in the teaming of Liev Schreibers unstable brute Victor a.k.a. Sabretooth with Danny Hustons controlling Gen. William Stryker military fascist and mad scientist.Theyre the teeth of Team X a Machiavellian corps of U.S. mutant thugs who bust heads internationally and who arent above torture rape and murder. Anything goes Stryker says because ""Your country needs you.""Where have we heard that before?Opposing them in the slow-boiling Obama style is Hugh Jackmans peace-loving Logan a.k.a. Wolverine a hairy guy of mythic origin from the Northwest Territories (erroneously named as such in a prologue set in 1845 before the N.W.T. officially existed). He opposes violence (""Im Canadian"") and will resort to it only in times of war or when his brother Victor/Sabretooth gets him really really angry.Theres more - Logans six-year sojourn lumberjacking in the Canadian woods matches Obamas six years in the Illinois Senate - but lets cut to the chase and say that there are a lot of chases in Wolverine all of them digitally tarted up to the wazoo and making no sense whatever for people not suffering from ADD. One minute Wolvie is ""indestructible"" the next hes being flattened by obese wrestlers rolling logs and crumbling nuclear plants.The film has the Achilles heel common to most superhero origin tales this one coming as a prequel to three earlier and superior X-Men movies (yes X-Men The Last Stand too). So much time is expended on the origin part that theres not much left by way of saving the planet from the bad guy du jour. And much of the origin tale is a hodgepodge of superhero and horror tropes. Whats missing is the humour that enlivens the better Marvel Comics adaptations notably Spider-Man and Iron Man. Canadas own Ryan Reynolds does his best to inject some laughs in his role as Team X motormouth Wade Wilson but lets just say that events conspire to zipper his lips. Too bad because hes never been better.Also MIA is the feminine strength that helps keep the testosterone from splashing over the sides. Theres just one woman of note in the film Lynn Collins Kayla Silverfox girlfriend to Logan and shes reduced to damsel-in-distress patronizing. But at least she has a role integral to the plot unlike Taylor Kitschs card-playing mutant Remy LeBeau a.k.a. Gambit who has been airbrushed into the film to satisfy geeks along with other extraneous mutants who will show up in larger roles in later films ho-hum. (Geek alert stay until the very end of the credits.)The whole thing would collapse under the weight of its own pretensions were it not for the considerable acting prowess of Jackman and Schreiber who know how to give good growl. They know theyre in a comic book movie but they act like theyre making Apocalypse Now and God bless em for it.And the films Bush/Cheney vs. Obama dynamics are surely not lost on either of them.

The question is was anyone wondering? Or are you like me content enough to admire the cool crazy talents of a society of freaks and geeks who find comfort in pooling their misunderstood powers? To put it another way Is it possible to make a movie about a superhero these days without injecting scenes of dreary superambivalence between expensive action sequences? (Batman Spider-Man and the Hulk? Big brooders.) Or is blessed freedom from neurosis granted only to villains? (The Joker? A fun guy.) The questions arise as Wolverine launches a new X-Men franchise based on origin myths that will allow for a pageant of younger stars. In the case of the superhero born James Howlett (known off duty as Logan and boasting the Sexiest Man Alive beauty of entertainer Hugh Jackman) traumatic past experiences include a fatal misunderstanding back in 1845 with a sinister-looking man the young Wolverine-to-be couldnt have known at the time was his real father. (The lad also couldnt have known hed grow up to sport a Paulie Walnuts hairdo.) Likewise theres emotional fallout from more than a century of love/hate between James/Logan/Wolverine and his lithe fiery and similarly clawed older brother Victor (Liev Schreiber). During their long years on the run together smacking down anyone who stood in their way the mutant siblings fought side by side in the Civil War two World Wars and the Vietnam War all in a matter of some 20 minutes of screen time. (Victor whose own talons are extensions of his hobo fingernails also goes by the name of Sabretooth for self-explanatory dental reasons.) The experience of all that fighting turned Logan into something of a pacifist or at least an Age of Psychotherapy introvert who wants to gain control of his own animal nature. In contrast Victor has no such niggles about the thrill of destructive instincts. No wonder Schreiber provides the most unfettered pleasure in this guilt-racked action pic. (No wonder too that Jackman in his capacity as producer tapped South African filmmaker Gavin Hood to direct after Hoods previous morality tales Tsotsi and Rendition.) Youd think all this would be enough shrinkwrapped backstory since the movie still needs space to introduce other newer mutants for their moments in the spotlight. (Ryan Reynolds has fun as the adversary who later comes to be known as Deadpool; Friday Night Lights Taylor Kitsch gives an inkling of the charms he might display in a future episode as Gambit; Black Eyed Peas frontman will.i.am makes an appealing feature-film debut as John Wraith a dude with a gift for now-you-see-him now-you-dont.) But lest the ladies feel alienated by all the masculine conflict the movie adds lovers grief as an additional motive for moodiness. And so we learn that Logans bliss was interrupted at the happiest time in his life when he was living simply as a hunky often shirtless law-abiding lumberjack in the Canadian Rockies nesting with with his dishy schoolteacher girlfriend Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins). After someone targets Kayla as a way of getting to her beau Wolvie yowls luxuriously and flashes his erect talons. Why ye gods of superhero comic books is someone out to get him? And whos to blame? Wolverine climaxes in a pileup of explosions complicated stunts violent man-on-man fights and hints especially if you stay until the end of the credits at sequels and spin-offs -- each fancy sequence simultaneously lacking both weight and lightness The effect-laden showdowns feel more dutiful than daring and the rare moments of fun are parceled out frugally like precious nuggets of adamantium. Meanwhile buff and bronzed as an Oscar statuette Jackman works the picture like a trouper. Heroes and villains clash then rise up to clash again just because thats what X-Men do.

The two are recruited by Col. William Stryker to join Team X a covert military squad made up of mutants.By Steven Rea Inquirer Movie CriticPosted May 01 2009Remember the Monty Python ""Lumberjack Song"" the one that goes ""Im a lumberjack and Im OK I sleep all night and I work all day.""Well at a pivotal point in X-Men Origins Wolverine Hugh Jackmans Logan - the brooding dude with the retractable talons anabolic musculature and modified Amish beard - is living in the Canadian Rockies. He has a chainsaw and an ax chops trees for a living and shares his cabin with a lovely schoolteacher (Lynn Collins). Hes a lumberjack and hes OK.Except that hes also an invincible mutant who has been alive since the 1840s is a veteran of the Civil War World War I World War II and Vietnam. And now a sinister Army colonel wants him back in the fold so he can fuse Logans bones with adamantium - a unique metal alloy. (Named for that 1980s Brit-pop phenom Adam Ant? Just asking.)In X-Men Origins Wolverine the cigar-chomping loner hero of the X-Men megahits is forced to give up his deforestation gig and come to terms with the ferocious animal buried in his soul. More than once the cameras of director Gavin Hoods Wolverine swoop above Jackman so as to better capture the actor as he tilts his head skyward and gives a mighty roar - his veins popping and his biceps bulging as he rages at the cruelty of it all.And cruelty it is - for him and a little bit for us too A mash-up of meaningless combat sequences (meaningless because Logan/Wolverine is just about unstoppable) sub-par visual effects template backstory and some goofy Liev Schreiber-as-a-villain thespianizing Wolverine falls into the origin-story trap that only Iron Man of recent superhero screen projects deftly maneuvered around. That is how the hero acquired his special powers turns out to be a whole lot less interesting than what he does with them and how he (or she) copes with being a freak.Speaking of Schreiber hes Victor Creed a.k.a. Sabretooth Logans fierce and feral brother. Victor has embraced his predatory animal self without hesitation - or conscience - making him even deadlier and more dangerous than his sibling. Beclawed and befanged hes one nasty-looking dude and Schreiber gives it his crazy-eyed all.As X-Men Origins Wolverine begins Sabretooth and Wolverine have been recruited by Col. William Stryker (Danny Huston) to join a ""special team with special privileges"" - Team X a covert military squad made up of mutants. They are Wade Wilson a.k.a. Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) a sword-wielding jabbermouth; Agent Zero (Daniel Henney) a pistol-packing acrobatic ninja; the teleporting John Wraith (Will.i.am); the super-strong super-fat Fred J. Dukes a.k.a. the Blob (Kevin Durand); and Bradley (Dominic Monaghan) who can manipulate electricity.Team X flies off on a stealth mission to Nigeria. Violence and ugliness ensue and Logan declares hes had enough - walking into the jungle and emerging as the happy lumberjack high on the hilltop with the lovely Kayla Silverfox (Collins) at his side.Judging by the clothes the cars and the weaponry Wolverine is set in the 1970s and 80s but its a generic sort of recent past not the ultra-specific and hallucinogenic pulp ugliness of Watchmens Nixonian period piece.As for Jackman he scowls and growls clenches his fists and goes through his action-pose routine with a straight face and a moral heaviness. Theres little of the seen-it-all wise-guy acerbity that made his character in the X-Men trilogy stand apart from his fellow mutants.

"Wolverine reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Wolverine reviewed. Wolverine reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.April 30 2009 752 PM Sideburns of Steel Wolverine is a long movie. By Dana Stevens To listen to Slates Spoiler Special about X-Men Origins Wolverine click the arrow button on the player You can also click here to download the MP3 file or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed in iTunes by clicking here. Wolverine They say that the beginning of summer has something to do with the tilting of the Earths axis toward the sun but everyone knows that the season really begins with the tilting of moviegoers eyeballs toward screens filled with moody comic-book heroes and Harley-Davidsons bursting from exploding barns and mutants battling atop nuclear reactors. The cinematic summer of 2009 officially begins May 1 with X-Men Origins Wolverine (Fox) the fourth installment of the X-Men franchise. Unlike the solstice on June 21 watching this movie only feels like the longest day of the year. Id like to kick off the season by stating that in 09 Ill be holding comic-book-based blockbusters to a more robust standard. No more prescreening visits to fanboy Web sites to brush up on characters back stories and ""deep mythology."" From now on even Part 4 of a series will have to stand on its own as a film and make some small degree of narrative sense. For an ""origins"" movie Wolverine seems oddly unconcerned with chronicling the emergence of its heros powers. So Ill follow suit and take only a vague stab at summarizing the murky doings on-screen One night in 1845 a Canadian boy named James Logan discovers that due to an unexplained genetic mutation his knuckles contain footlong claws that emerge only when hes angry. After the obligatory Oedipal reveal (in which a lucky bit player gets to utter the line ""He wasnt your father ... son"" before expiring beneath Jimmys claws) James and his older brother Victor grow up to be played by Hugh Jackman and Liev Schreiber both bemuscled and luxuriantly sideburned. Advertisement In a well-crafted if ponderous title sequence these two feral remorseless and apparently immortal brothers are seen fighting side by side in every American conflict from the Civil War to Vietnam. When their special powers are discovered in Nam the boys are sought out by Col. Stryker (Danny Huston) whos organizing a Dirty Dozen-style team of mutant mercenaries for international no-good-doing. Jimmy fed up with the teams atrocities defects to lead a simpler life as a country lumberjack shacking up (in an actual shack) with the fetching Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins). But it wont be long until Jimmys mutant past disrupts this idyll. After Victor savagely attacks Kayla (hes now an evil brother) an enraged Jimmy agrees to Strykers plan to inject his skeleton with the super-mineral adamantium turning his already-deadly retractable claws from keratin into shimmering steel. The first time Jackman appeared shirtless about 15 minutes into the movie his absurdly pneumatic chest garnered one of the few laughs at the screening that I attended. I can understand why--theres something ridiculous about the very being of Hugh Jackman with his flaring nostrils and almost equine handsomeness. His best roles are the ones that harness that silliness but even as a dour action hero Jackman has enough charisma to emerge with his dignity intact. Liev Schreiber pulls out a few too many stops as the obscurely motivated Victor/Sabretooth but you have to feel for the guy From Shakespeare in the Park to this? And Lynn Collins made a lovely Portia opposite Al Pacinos Shylock in The Merchant of Venice but as Wolverines schoolteacher girlfriend the quality of her mercy is a bit strained. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Even by the standard of a fourth-in-a-series summer blockbuster Wolverine the first X-Men movie directed by Gavin Hood ( Rendition) is remarkably lame. At least three of its images are cliched enough to have already been parodied on The Simpsons the hero silhouetted against the sunset as he carries his girl to safety; the aforementioned climactic showdown on top of a nuclear reactor (unfortunately unlike Homer no character here is wearing a muumuu); and the hero shouting ""Nooooo"" over his beloveds body as the camera pulls up to the heavens. Unfortunately by movies end its not clear if either the girl or the franchise has been definitively laid to rest.

The documentary film was written and directed by Clay Tweel. Photo Open Road Films By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Updated July 30 2016 155 p.m. ET 3 COMMENTS The subject of Clay Tweels superb documentary feature is Steve Gleason the former New Orleans Saints safety who was diagnosed with ALS or Lou Gehrigs disease in 2011. Shortly afterward Mr. Gleason started chronicling the progress of his disease in a video diary but six weeks later he and his wife Michel learned she was pregnant. At that point the diary became for the most part a series of straight-to-the-camera messages to his son Rivers both before and after the birth. ""My intention"" he says at the outset when his speech is still unimpaired ""is to pass on as much of who I am as I possibly can to you."" What was meant as a gift to his son is a gift to anyone who watches the film which incorporates Mr. Gleasons home videos in a profile of almost unfathomable courage--hes still very much with us although his body has been ravaged by the disease--and a portrait of a profoundly good man. ENLARGE Michel Gleason Steve Gleason and Rivers Gleason. Photo Open Road Films ""Gleason"" is so powerful in its cumulative effect that it should be accompanied by a consumer advisory--something along the lines of ""This documentary may cause sudden alterations of mood and attitude."" I can attest to having been undone by at least one scene and Im far from an easy weeper; its a confrontation between Mr. Gleason and his own father a man with rigid notions of good and evil. The moment is at once heart-rending and transcendently beautiful and father-and-son themes play in parallel throughout the film or perhaps they intertwine in a double helix. Mr. Gleason is determined to be a better father for his son than his father was for him even though he must speak through a voice synthesizer by the time Rivers is starting to talk. More Reviews Jason Bourne Indignation Summer Movie Preview Interactive Watch trailers and read more about the summers crop of films The film is authentically inspiring but also unsparing in its depiction of the horrors of ALS and its impact on the family. (The implacable strength of Michel Gleason could be the subject of a separate film.) The disease moves swiftly attacking Steve Gleasons spirit as well as his body. There are times captured by the unblinking camera when his agonies seem unendurable yet he has rejected assisted suicide and chosen to live out a life that brings joy with the pain. In one conjunction of more emotions than can be put into words we see him struggling to breathe while he watches Rivers struggling to blow out all four candles on his birthday cake. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download The Theory of Everything (2014) Eddie Redmayne stars brilliantly as the cosmologist Stephen Hawking who at age 21 was diagnosed with a motor neuron disorder related to Lou Gehrigs disease and given two years to live. More than half a century later hes still going strong. See James Marshs movie as a companion piece to ""Gleason"" an enjoyable demonstration of the difference between nonfiction films that can enthrall and informative features that entertain. 353 Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Video by 20th Century Fox>> LAUNCH VIDEO PLAYER Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By John Anderson Special to The Washington Post Friday May 1 2009 Unless you actually care that Sabretooth is Wolverines brother -- not his father -- you probably wont care that much about ""X-Men Origins Wolverine."" Except of course for the explosions the mutants the claws the noise the guns the samurai swords and the titles chilling suggestion that an ""Origins"" film could be in the works for every extant X-Man and -Woman. Consider the consequences; buy your ticket accordingly. This StoryMOVIES So Violent and Yet So BloodlessSummer Movie GuideX-Men Origins WolverineDiscuss Jackman vs. McConaugheyFind Wolverine Showtimes and TicketsView All Items in This StoryView Only Top Items in This Story If ""Wolverine"" suggests anything its that living breathing people in big-budget mainstream movies are rapidly becoming obsolete. Were almost there. Hugh Jackman might be the contractual star of this Marvel Comics-inspired production which explores (creates) the history of one of Marvels most popular and conflicted heroes. But technology gives the movie what it has. And what it has is all the humanity of a 150 million video game. If thats your thing go for it The fanboys will no doubt flock to see how the most famous Canadian superheros back story is turned into exploding celluloid (and proceed to trash it before the credits have rolled). But for those without a deep emotional attachment to the razor-clawed Wolverine its hard to understand what the draw might be. But there is a story. It begins in 1845 in darkest Canadas Northwest Territories where young brothers James and Victor (Troye Sivan and Michael-James Olsen) are just growing into their mutant powers -- fever is part of the process apparently and young James is suffering. When an intruder forces his way into the home and commits an act of violence the no-longer-ailing boy manifests the first signs of Wolverine-dom flashing claws from between his knuckles impaling the killer and letting loose the first of many howls that will echo down through history (and the movie). The Civil War World Wars I and II Korea Vietnam -- James (Jackman) and Victor (Liev Schreiber) fight together through all of them rarely being wounded recovering instantly from the injuries they do suffer and vanquishing the bad guys of the moment. In the flashes we get from each war Victor is always the more sadistic of the two -- hes one twisted unkillable dude actually -- and James a.k.a. Logan constantly has to rein him in. You can see where this is going Conflict. Nothing but conflict. Its always the same Guys have superpowers. You think theyd be happy. But no. Conflict. All the time conflict. ""Wolverine"" is full of angst and yet has had virtually all the soul wrung out of it in an effort to create a live-action cartoon. But cartoons are rarely so unwieldy or force a director -- in this case the largely unsung Gavin Hood -- to juggle so much impossible plotline. Victor and James are recruited by the mysterious governmental William Stryker (Danny Huston) to join a Dirty Dozen-style team of . . . what are they exactly? Super-mercenaries? We dont know. Nor do we know why once the group breaks up Victor starts killing all its old members. Or why in Gods name he would kill Logans girlfriend Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins) with whom Wolverine has been living on a mountaintop in the Canadian Rockies minding his own business. Or why mutant children are being kidnapped to an island off the coast of insanity. Or what Stryker is after. It all comes out eventually. But a characters motivation is a lot less effective dramatically speaking when its delivered at the tail end of the movie. There are those for whom all of ""Wolverine"" will make sense. Like ""Watchmen"" the years previous comic-book sensation (sort of) ""Wolverine"" has a clubinesss about it a sense that there are insiders and outsiders and only the hippest Wolveriners will get the jokes. But unlike ""Watchmen"" theres also an anti-humanity to ""Wolverine."" Its heros tag line -- ""Im the best there is at what I do but what I do isnt very nice"" -- might well be applied to Hollywood When human beings start to seem like intrusions into the pyrotechnical computer imagery then the movies have become something implicitly unwelcoming and something other than cinema. X-Men Origins Wolverine (107 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for violence intense action and fleeting nudity. >> This StoryRead +|Watch +|Talk +| Comments (c) 2009 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  So Violent and Yet So Bloodless Summer Movie Guide Find Wolverine Showtimes and Tickets X-Men Origins Wolverine Discuss Jackman vs. McConaughey",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/30/AR2009043004044.html,200,x-menoriginswolverine27,x-menoriginswolverine,washingtonpost

By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / May 1 2009 Email| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Hello police? Come quick A naked man just leapt over a fake-looking waterfall.Describe him? I dont know. Bee Gees hair. Clint Eastwood scowl. Zero-percent body fat. And a metal endoskeleton that would make him hell to stand behind at airport security. I think he just hosted the Oscars.This naked man - known the world over as Hugh Jackman - is slogging his way through ""X-Men Origins Wolverine."" I cant say why this movie is necessary but here it is all 107 minutes and 10 gazillion of it.As the title implies the movie presents the X-Mens most volatile mutants early years when he was neither the mysterious Logan nor lawless Wolverine but the virtually indestructible apparently immortal James Howlett.This is big news for those dying to see actual bone spiking from Jamess knuckles instead of the claws made of the strange substance (adamantium) the government injected along his skeletal system in a cruel military experiment.There is Wolverine trivia. Did you know for instance that he fought in the Civil War the two World Wars and Vietnam? (Theres a montage for your enlightenment.) He did so alongside his more heartless brother Victor (Liev Schreiber). When James walks out on Victor and the band of assassins doing covert military work for the rogue general Stryker (Danny Huston) Victor tracks him down in the Pacific Northwest where hes been living as a civilian logger named Logan. He kills Logans dewy ladylove (Lynn Collins) and draws him into Ye Olde Hunt for Revenge which culminates in an entertaining showdown on the lip of a nuclear reactor.""Wolverine"" feels enslaved to its many masters - Marvel Comics Hollywood and the young men who devour their products - never sidestepping the deja vu it inspires. Ive seen this movie before and its not because my barber hooked me up with a leaked DVD although there is that. Its partly a matter of having seen this character struggle with his origins in three previous X-Men movies one of which gave us a comprehensive explanation in blips of flashback.Often it seemed that the comics original collection of writers were unsure of who Wolverine was or how he came to be. I spent many hours as a boy trying to figure out what the deal was with this guy. Whatever his back story he was an intriguing character - nasty vicious bitter dangerous and in his own way sexy.In Bryan Singers 2000 ""X-Men"" Jackman captured all of that in star-making fashion. We would never really know Logan - he wouldnt let us. But we wanted to know more about Jackman. Nothing hes done in the movies since has been as interesting or believably intense. His stage and emcee work suggests hes a more thrilling showman than action figure.Inside an ensemble Jackman had other people to chafe. On his own at least here hes just another physical specimen in a movie that doesnt have nearly as many ideas - visually or thematically - as anything in the ""X-Men"" trilogy. In ""Wolverine"" his exasperated give-me-a-break moments are his best - theyre certainly the most relatable. Otherwise theres not much for Jackman to do opposite Schreiber Huston or Ryan Reynolds whos put to comically bad use playing what appears to be the same part he had in the last ""Blade"" movie - the smarty-pants who appears to eat shoulder-presses for breakfast.Director Gavin Hood (""Tsotsi"" ""Rendition"") likes shot-making you can get from a kit - the wounded screaming at the sky as the camera sails heavenward say or the hero walking sternly slowly out of the frame while something burns extravagantly behind him.Advances in personal training and dietary supplements may have brought actors closer than ever to comic-book physiques. But movies based on comic books require a visionary at least equal to the one that made such vivid worlds of the books themselves. May future ""Wolverine"" installments feature moviemaking as steroidal as some of the bodies.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The trouble with X-Men Origins Wolverine starts but hardly ends with its title. Origin stories are a necessary burden for superhero movies but after starring in three X-Men movies Hugh Jackmans Wolverine didnt really need an introduction. Whats more Wolverine has always worked best in comics as a high plains drifter of a character whose origins remain shrouded in mystery even from himself. Still someone decided the story needed telling although presumably no one set out to tell it this badly. We first meet Wolverine as a sickly child on a 19th century Canadian plantation. In a fit of anger he pops claws of bone from his fist and kills the man he believes to have killed his father who with his dying breath confesses that hes actually the kids father. Confused? Dont worry about it. The film never really bothers returning to the whys and wherefores of his parentage instead aging the young mutant and his similarly superpowered half-brother into Hugh Jackman and Liev Schreiber through a montage sequence that shows them fighting their way through American conflicts from the Civil War up through Vietnam. (Only the most famous ones but maybe the DVD will have images of the beclawed duo charging up San Juan hill or laying the smackdown in Mexico.) After Schreiber the more mean-tempered of the two kills a superior in Nam theyre recruited by Danny Hustons shifty vaguely Nixonian Col. Stryker to perform covert ops with a bunch of other mutants. Biting commentary on the abuses of military power fails to follow. Instead director Gavin Hood (Tsotsi) offers a lot of slickly uninvolving action scenes and a dramatic vocabulary on loan from playground recreations of Wrath Of Khan; the films so in love with the image of its hero shouting ""Noooooo"" to the sky with arms outstretched it repeats it seemingly every other scene. Its remarkable too how Jackman could be so loose and charming in the other X-Men movies but so hamstrung playing the same character in a script by David Benioff and Skip Woods that requires more emo mopery than anti-hero wit. It doesnt help that hes stuck in bad company. The usually cerebral Schreiber proves unexpectedly menacing as Jackmans blood-nemesis but the film otherwise surrounds him with second-string mutant scrubs who arent given much to do and then dont do generate a lot of interest doing it. Friday Night Lights Taylor Kitsch seems unsure where to run with the Cajun playboy Gambit and ends up taking him nowhere while Will.I.Am in his big-screen debut treats every line as a fearful surprise. A couple of halfway decent action scenes do little to distract from the storys mounting ludicrousness--two words adamantium bullets--or a conclusion thats only a little more satisfying than a projector breakdown.

A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Without fail the dullest installment in any superhero movie franchise is the origin story during which audiences anxiously awaiting The Big Bad Guy have to suffer through yaaaawn scenes of childhood trauma romantic tragedy and other expository effluvia by which point the closing credits are fast approaching. Alas the X-Men franchise takes a giant leap backward and off a cliff with its fourth offering--yet again starring now-co-producer Hugh Jackman as the scissorhands from Canada--by collapsing 30 years worth of comic-book backstory into an altogether anticlimactic who-dat. Wow so thats how Jimmy Logan got those kick-ass razorblades in his knuckles. What else ya got? Not much The filmmakers--among them Tsotsi director Gavin Hood and 25th Hour writer David Benioff no joke--relegate the most interesting parts of Logans early story to an opening-credits sequence that dashes from his 1845 childhood to the Civil War to the Vietnam War in a span of seconds. Sooner or later of course Logans on the operating table and being injected with the unbreakable adamantium metal that gives his skeleton a sparkly shine. And sooner or later we meet the familiar rogues the villainous Sabretooth (Wolverines brother this time around played by Liev Schreiber with ""the fingernails of a bag lady"") the treacherous William Stryker (the Brian Cox character in 03 now recast with Danny Huston) even a certain Cyclops (a whiny teenager with bad eyes in keeping with the franchises history of treating the X-Mens longtime leader like a spindly punch line) and the inevitable cameo by a very familiar X-tra. Most of the action is a mere replay of a single sequence Wolverine and Sabretooth galloping toward one another two immortal bros locked in eternal combat. Certainly feels like it. And the filmmakers have further junked up the franchise with bit players from the comic books among them the playing card-throwing Gambit (Taylor Kitsch) and assassin Deadpool (whose comic relief shuts off around the time the moviemakers unwisely sew together Ryan Reynolds lips bad move among many). Odd thing is 2003s expeditious X2 more or less covered the same ground in a matter of seconds as opposed to 107 minutes that feel like almost as many hours. A suggestion? Wait for the bootleg.

And killer claws in X-Men Origins Wolverine. As Wolverine the unstoppable mutant with the shiny metal knuckle knives Jackman artfully embodies a character who is both ferocious and humane. In this fourth X-Men installment we learn how Wolverine is recruited into a secret military corps and lured into the sinister Weapon X program. QUIZTest your Wolverine wisdom TRAILERWhat will Hugh do for you? INTERVIEW Optimism is Hugh Jackmans ticket to success Jackman invests his fierce character with a cheeky attitude clear-eyed intelligence and inherent decency compelling viewers to care about his metamorphosis. Wolverine set circa mid-1970s also reveals the early years of the vicious Sabretooth (Liev Schreiber) and the villainous William Stryker (Danny Huston). A few mutants are unveiled Deadpool a wise-cracking swordsman with deadly aim (Ryan Reynolds); Gambit (Taylor Kitsch) who can imbue inanimate objects with explosive charges; and the teleporting Wraith (The Black Eyed Peas Will.i.am). Despite a couple of ""Nooooo"" yowls Wolverine is well-acted with spectacular action and witty one-liners. The special effects are top-notch. A few plot points raise questions such as how Wolverine lost his memory. And his romance with Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins) is unconvincing. Some sequences stand out A scene with a helicopter a tank and several Hummers in pursuit of Wolverine is exhilarating. Equally spectacular is a climactic fight on the edge of a nuclear reactor. Though consistent in tone with the previous movies this prequel directed by Gavin Hood (2005s foreign-language Oscar winner Tsotsi) is an otherworldly fantasy where the others were dark and brooding sci-fi adventures. Although its a quintessential popcorn movie Wolverine is not mindless. Hood and Jackman bring depth to a comic-book tale of anti-heroes with anger issues.

(James Fisher) Joe Neumaier Friday May 1 2009 1043 AM Title X-Men Origins Wolverine The clawed mutant battles his brother. With Hugh Jackman Liev Schreiber. (148) PG-13 Comic-book violence. At area theaters. The signature moment -- done four times -- from ""X-Men Origins Wolverine"" is an overhead shot of Hugh Jackman with his arms and metallic blades outstretched screaming as the camera pulls away. Its the perfect response to this slice-and-dice superhero fiasco. A prequel to the ""X-Men"" trilogy made between 2000 and 2006 ""Wolverine"" is silly and typical not in spite of but because it bonds an undeveloped family feud onto the main characters renegade story. Faithfulness to Marvel Comics can be debated by those who know but average moviegoers -- people who saw the illegal download or are hungry for a blockbuster -- will likely find it a clanky mess salvaged solely by Jackmans charisma. In 1845 Canadian kid James Logan goes from sickly to fast-healing just as his anger erupts and his hands sprout bone-claws; his older half-brother Victor (Liev Schreiber) has similar powers sans claws. As the boys grow into mutually mutton-chopped brethren they fight in every war that comes along. (A ""Benjamin Button""-esque montage shows them running through the Civil War World Wars I and II and Vietnam.  They apparently skipped the Spanish-American War.) In Nam Logan disobeys villainous Col. Stryker (Danny Huston) and deserts his brother and a group of mutant mercenaries. This inexplicably ticks off the bloodthirsty Viktor -- he should just be happy that after more than a century they both look 38 years old -- so he tricks Logan into Strykers experiment to adhere ""Adamantium"" alloy onto his skeleton. Thats useful when Logan liberates captured mutants just as Strykers most nasty creation attacks. Unlike earlier ""X-Men"" flicks none of the supporting mutants stand out including those played by Ryan Reynolds and Taylor Kitsch and all seem to have vaguely the same skills especially leaping; always with the leaping. Even Schreiber whose trenchcoated growler is called Sabretooth doesnt click. Its like his scowling rebel from ""Defiance"" sprouted fangs and wandered onto the set. Jackman does what he can but he cant make up for director Gavin Hoods gauzy lack of enthusiasm (Wolverines lab scene isnt scary -- has Hood ever seen a mad scientist movie?) or the fact that the series sexual and political overtones has been replaced by hackneyed battle scenes. We see Wolverine get a motorcycle have his memory erased and gain his knuckle-knives. We watch as he loves loses and lumberjacks. Whats never captured is why we should care.

The first blockbuster of Hollywoods summer accomplishes its mission with elan -- if a tad less stylishly or humorously than last years heavy metal kickoff ""Iron Man."" Which is not to say this prequel to the ""X-Men"" trilogy is rusty. PHOTOS Wolverine Men Howl On-Screen Its packed with nonstop action has cutting-edge special effects and stunt work terrific cinematography (by Donald McAlpine) and beautiful locations and is tautly directed by Gavin Hood. A super-buff Jackman gets to explore the character in more depth than previously and Liev Schreiber as his brother makes a dandy bad guy. But like most superhero origin stories theres a certain predictability inherent in sketching in the back story of a well-established character like Wolverine. After an intriguing prologue set in 1845 that establishes our hero and Victor (later Sabretooth) as mutant brothers the movie segues into the best title sequence since ""Watchmen."" We watch the brothers fight in the Civil War World War I World War II and Vietnam (somehow they miss Korea). By that point theyre in a covert cadre of military mutants known as Team X. But Wolverine lacks the blood lust of the others particularly Victor and walks away during a mission in Namibia. Six years later settled with a wife (Lynn Collins) and working as a lumberjack in the Canadian Rockies they pull him back in again after tragedy strikes. Wolverine wants vengeance against his brother for an unspeakable act. But can he trust Colonel Stryker the former commander of Team X who offers to increase Wolverines powers with Marvel Comics signature super-strong alloy adamantium so he can triumph over Sabretooth? ""Were going to make you indestructible"" he says. ""But first we have to destroy you."" Though Danny Huston is less menacing than Brian Cox -- who played Stryker in ""X-2"" -- its fairly obvious things are not going to work out as planned. At attempt to erase Wolvies memory launches our newly enhanced hero on an odyssey that takes him from Las Vegas to New Orleans to Three Mile Island where he encounters (and re-encounters) numerous -- perhaps a bit too numerous for the films good -- mutants. They include the all-too-briefly glimpsed Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) Gambit (the wonderfully named Taylor Kitsch) Bolt (Dominic Monaghan) and the young character later to be known as Cyclops who has his own secret. Fortunately Jackman is well-matched with Schreiber who can sneer with the best of them and wears fangs well. The two have three spectacular battles together before squaring off against a formidable enemy atop a nuclear reactor. Theres no shortage of ""wow"" moments but the strong liberal political subtext of the trilogy has largely disappeared. Thats a surprise coming from South African director Hood who helmed ""Rendition"" perhaps the most pointed movie to come out of the second Gulf War. But he keeps the films camp elements in check and the story moving. ""X-Men Origins"" is sharp enough to get the job done. lou.lumenicknypost.com Running time 108 minutes. Rated PG-13 (sci-fi violence disturbing images brief nudity). At the Empire Union Square others.

X-Men Origins Wolverine Director Gavin Hood. Cast Hugh Jackman Liev Schreiber Ryan Reynolds. Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of action and violence and some partial nudity. Great Good Fair Bad Bomb Related Crowds go wild for Wolverine at premiere Superheroes we love Complete coverage Wolverine leads pack at box office with 87M Wolverines Tempe premiere Reporting chat video Multimedia Wolverine premiere in Tempe Wolverine premiere Interviews cast The leak raised legitimate concerns about piracy and its effects as well as the perils of evaluating a work still in progress. (I did not see the leaked movie.) Ironic then that the final version of the film seems unfinished. A mix of solid action and an underused cast with star Hugh Jackman left shouldering the burden of bad lines and forced emotion it leaves you longing for more editing and a tighter story. Jackman reprising his role from the ""X-Men"" trilogy as the title character remains a good fit in this prequel. Athletic and graceful he moves with a confidence befitting a mutant whose remarkable healing powers have seen him through several wars. Jackmans physicality is Wolverines strength; his emoting not so much. Still Jackman ever game does what he can. As with any origin story theres a lot of ground to cover in a relatively short time. But whats really needed here is more screen time for the likes of Taylor Kitsch as Gambit and especially Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool. The latter is particularly good; the only things faster than his mouth are his hands when they have swords in them. Seen early in the film almost singlehandedly defeating a small army of thugs (including slicing a bullet in half in midair; neat trick) Deadpool would be a great soldier if he could just shut up says his commander Col. Stryker (Danny Huston). Unfortunately Hood and writers David Benioff and Skip Woods make him do exactly that The character disappears until . . . well lets just say a lot later. The film begins in the 19th century with Logan the man who will become Wolverine as a sickly boy. A family tragedy - thats putting it mildly - lands him on the lam with his older brother Victor. Hood morphs the two from an escape through the woods to various battlefields in history until theyre court-martialed and executed. Except the execution doesnt take. Stryker recruits Logan and Victor now played by Liev Schreiber for an elite task force with various powers. Victor for instance has long nails fangs and a bad attitude. Logan of course has retractable claws. Victor has more of a taste for this kind of mercenary work than does his brother so after a particularly unpleasant mission Logan quits the business and takes up working as a logger in his native Canada and living with Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins). This blissful life is interrupted when former members of the team turn up dead. Stryker comes calling and in a more eventful way so does Victor. (Cue Jackmans emoting.) Fueled by revenge Logan agrees to allow Stryker to perform a procedure on him as part of the Weapon X program which will make him practically indestructible - a choice about which Stryker quickly has second thoughts. This all leads to a conspiracy involving other mutants that shouldnt be revealed not because it would spoil things but because it would just confuse them. After far too many last-second out-of-the-blue rescues Logan has fully inhabited the Wolverine character and either by a neat trick or by a cheat depending on your point of view whether all this aligns with your idea of his backstory wont really matter. While packed with effects and action without the attention to story and emotional investment present in such films as ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Ironman"" ""Wolverine"" ultimately doesnt rise above its comic-book roots. For the fanboy that may be fine. For the rest of us its not quite enough. Reach Goodykoontz at 602-444-8974 or bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Read his blog at goodyblog.azcentral.com.

Heavily fortified with adamantium testosterone and CGI ""X-Men Origins Wolverine"" is a sharp-clawed dull-witted actioner that falls short of the two Bryan Singer-directed pics in the franchise but still overpowers 2006s ""X-Men The Last Stand."" For all its attempts to probe the physiological and psychological roots of its tortured antihero this brawny but none-too-brainy prequel sustains interest mainly -- if only fitfully -- as a nonstop slice-and-dice vehicle for Hugh Jackman. An unfinished print leaked online weeks before the films May 1 Stateside release will prove a mere flesh wound to Foxs B.O. haul which should be muscular locally and abroad. Relatively unknown before the release of the first ""X-Men"" film in 2000 Jackman placed an immediate and definitive stamp on the role of Logan the virtually indestructible human/mutant Cuisinart better known to Marvel comicbook fans as Wolverine. Though its as thick with exposition as any cinematic adaptation of a complex and beloved superhero mythology the screenplay by David Benioff and Skip Woods relies to a lazy and excessive degree on both Jackmans considerable charisma and fan awareness of Wolverines preternatural abilities. Theres little emotional modulation or sense of discovery as Logan morphs from hardened soldier to angry but principled rebel seeking revenge on the mad scientist who engineered him. An 1845-set prologue creepily if confusingly establishes this tale of two mutants Logan (Jackman) whose knuckles are equipped with retractable fangs and older less stable brother Victor aka Sabretooth (Liev Schreiber). The siblings superhuman strength agility and capacity for self-regeneration make them ideal soldiers to fight in the Civil War WWI WWII and Vietnam -- and all in one opening-credits sequence no less -- before the coolly mysterious Gen. William Stryker (an effective Danny Huston) recruits them for a covert-ops unit known as Team X. After a mission to Nigeria that involves civilian casualties Logan decides hes had enough and flees to Victors violent chagrin. Six years later Logan is living in Canada -- just to hammer home that hes a nice peace-loving guy and all -- but is too easily drawn back into battle when his loving g.f. Kayla (Lynn Collins) dies at Victors claws. Determined to slay his brother Logan submits to a top-secret experiment by Stryker that will infuse his skeleton with a super-strong metal adamantium rendering him all but invincible. But he soon realizes he was naive to trust Stryker whose inscrutably sinister motives take a while to fully emerge. Still bent on finding Victor and left temporarily if discreetly butt-naked after the experiment Logan has an uneasy reunion with some of his former Team X compadres including teleporter John Wraith (Will.i.am) and prosthetically overweight Fred Dukes (Kevin Durand) aka the Blob. Its here that Gavin Hood (helming his second studio feature after ""Rendition"") sets the pic on action-thriller autopilot ensuring that ""Wolverine"" meets its quota of motorcycle chases helicopter accidents fisticuffs impalements near-decapitations (one of the pics weirder more unsettling fixations) and yet more civilian casualties. As the action takes hold -- and its perfectly good action though lensed and edited with more energy than coherence -- psychological plausibility falls by the wayside as does any investment in the no-brainer question of whether Wolverine will succumb to his baser bloodier impulses or take the high road in his pursuit of justice. A shot of Logan nonchalantly walking away from a heap of exploding wreckage his good looks smoldering like so much digital napalm says more about the storys dramatic priorities than any of the on-the-nose dialogue (""Youre not an animal"" ""To kill him youre going to have to embrace the other side"" etc). Script also traffics in the kind of flat shopworn comic relief thats become de rigeur for superhero fare -- mostly courtesy of mutant Remy LeBeau aka Gambit (Taylor Kitsch) a New Orleans cardsharp who teams with Logan at the midpoint. Absent from the ""X-Men"" movies until now this rugged Southern charmer is one of the series more popular characters but his appearance here is poorly and arbitrarily integrated into the scenario. Jackman just about holds things together with his reliable but hardly revelatory all-brooding-all-the-time act; for sheer bellowing rage hes occasionally upstaged by Schreiber whose grisly vampiric presence has some interesting points of overlap with his role as another volatile bad-seed brother in Ed Zwicks recent ""Defiance."" Noisy and impersonal ""X-Men Origins Wolverine"" bears all the marks of a work for hire conceived and executed with a big budget but little imagination -- an exception being Barry Robisons intriguing production design for Strykers island compound. Shot in Jackmans native Australia the pic is apparently set in the 1970s though one would have to read the press materials to realize this.
