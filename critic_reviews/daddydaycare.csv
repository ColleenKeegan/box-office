This plodding would-be comedy follows in the tradition of last years trio of missteps The Adventures of Pluto Nash Showtime and I Spy. But audiences love Murphy in the lovable dad mode (Dr. Dolittle and its sequel were big hits) so Day Care is likely to offer at least opening-weekend success. Eddie Murphy stars in Daddy Day Care. The story is so formulaic and the proceedings so humorless that one cant help but ask what happened to the talented comic actor who made Beverly Hills Cop and more recently charmed audiences as the donkey in Shrek. Murphy is so oddly bland in Daddy Day Care that it seems like he sleepwalked through the making of the film. His edgy humor has been watered down making it palatable for family audiences but anyone over 10 is not likely to find this movie entertaining or clever. Review of the movie Daddy Day Care ( out of four) Stars Eddie Murphy Anjelica Huston Jeff Garlin Steve Zahn Director Steve Carr Distributor Revolution Studios Rating PG for language. Opens Friday nationwide Murphy plays a workaholic advertising executive who rarely sees his young son. Though Murphy and his wife (Regina King) live in a prosperous suburb for some reason their only choices for child care are a scary trailer park or the ridiculously exclusive Chapman Academy which requires preschoolers to learn five foreign languages. When Murphy loses his job he flounders until he comes up with the idea of running a day care center out of his house. He recruits male former colleagues and draws a dozen kids giving the hoity-toity Chapman Academy overseen by a harridan headmistress (Anjelica Huston) a run for its money. Hollywood executives seem fascinated by movies about the foibles of men taking care of children (Big Daddy Mr. Mom Three Men and a Baby) but laughs usually are part of the equation. This movies 93 minutes are pretty much laugh-free despite the presence of several ordinarily funny co-stars including Steve Zahn so hilarious in Out of Sight and Happy Texas and Jeff Garlin whos a hoot on the HBO series Curb Your Enthusiasm. Murphy plays straight man to a dozen kids who though cute dont have the chops to pull off real gags. Khamani Griffin the adorable 4-year-old who plays Murphys son inspired the only chuckle I could muster and that was in an outtake shown after the movie itself. You know something is wrong when a preschoolers unwitting ad-libs are funnier than anything seasoned comedy writers can come up with. Kids say the darnedest things. Too bad the grown-ups dont.

Charlie Hinton (Eddie Murphy) and his son Ben (Khamani Griffin of Oakland) take it to the hoop in ""Daddy Day Care."" Eddie without the edge / The kids get the best lines in Murphys Daddy Day Care 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Daddy Day Care Kids comedy. Starring Eddie Murphy Jeff Garlin Anjelica Huston and Khamani Griffin. Directed by Steve Carr. Written by Geoff Rodkey. (PG. 93 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) After some recent box office losers in movies for grown-ups -- especially ""The Adventures of Pluto Nash"" and ""I Spy"" -- Eddie Murphy goes back to warm and fuzzy in ""Daddy Day Care"" a harmless and amusing summer comedy. It is his ""Dr. Dolittle"" mode where he makes funny faces and gives all the best lines to the little characters -- rodents birds and kids. He really is Dr. Do Little. While he mugs and winces everyone else does the heavy lifting. Director Steve Carr wrings about all he can from a premise we can see coming from a mile away. Charlie (Murphy) and his buddy Phil (Jeff Garlin) are laid-off dads who lost their cushy jobs in the economic crunch. With their wives working Phil and Charlie end up with the child care responsibilities. When they cant find jobs they figure they can take care of 11 kids as easily as two and open a day care center. And guess what? Things go perfectly. The kids are calm and well behaved there are no potty problems and nothing gets broken. Right. And then we wouldnt have a movie. Actually the guys find out that they know nothing about taking care of kids the day care posse ransacks the house and Charlie and Phil take a pounding from the pip-squeaks. The hapless dads are pretty amusing. ""What we need"" Charlie says at one point ""is structure and planning."" ""No"" replies Phil ""Ritalin and leashes. Thats what we need."" But you will not be surprised to hear they persevere and learn some valuable lessons not only about running their business but also about how they relate to their own sons. Along the way another plot is tacked on about an exclusive day care center and its snooty owner played by Anjelica Huston in some serious slumming. The Oscar-winning actress probably was sold on the idea that this would be a chance to exercise her comic chops. Put the chops back Anjelica. Her character is so over the top it belongs in another movie. Everyone else hits the right notes however. Garlin once you get over the fact that he is not George Wendt who played Norm on ""Cheers"" has a nice way with a line. So does Steve Zahn as Marvin who is such a space cadet that he read ""Dr. Spocks Baby and Child Care"" because he thought it was about ""Star Trek."" And we must not neglect Khamani Griffin the pride of Oakland as Murphys son Ben. Only 4 years old Griffin had no problem taking the microphone before a large crowd at a local screening -- ""Hello"" he chirped ""I am the star of Daddy Day Care "" -- and is just as poised and impish on screen. If you stick around for the blooper reel after the show youll see that he ad- libbed right along with Murphy. Murphy has an easy way with the kids but it cant be said that what he is doing here is much of a stretch. He has a few moments but for the most part he is just an amiable good-natured fellow around whom the other characters revolve. At one time Murphy was an edgy late-night comic decked out in red leather for a comedy video called ""Raw."" Now hes just another sitcom dad.

"Daddy Day Care Murphy Kids Around washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids On Screen Daddy Day Care Murphy Kids Around Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday May 9 2003 IN ""Daddy Day Care"" an easy-on-the-sensibilities family film Eddie Murphy practically assumes the easygoing manner of Mister Rogers a character he used to wickedly lampoon on ""Saturday Night Live."" Hes certainly come a long way since he cussed and gay-bashed his way through the 1980s concert movies ""Eddie Murphy Delirious"" and ""Eddie Murphy Raw."" Weve seen variations of Murphys kid-friendly comically laid-back persona in two ""Nutty Professor"" movies and two ""Dr. Dolittle"" films which prompts the question Is there a permanent ""new"" Murphy or does he simply alternate these roles with sassier ones in movies such as ""I Spy"" and ""Shrek""? Whatever the answer Murphy has clearly opted for likability (to the point of innocuousness) over outrageous antics in ""Daddy Day Care."" This may work out just fine for preteen and young teen audiences and the parents whose lifetime job it is to serve them. Murphy plays Charlie Hinton a husband and hardworking professional whose only shortfall is a crying need to spend more time with his kid. When he loses his job in product development at a food company hes forced to pull his son Ben (Khamani Griffin) from a prestigious preschool run by Miss Harridan (Anjelica Huston in Joan Crawford-lite mode). His yuppie wife Kim (Regina King) gets the keys to his Mercedes and Charlie gets to entertain Ben at home all day. Unable to find a new job for weeks Charlie is more than responsive when a friend mentions that a new day-care center would make a killing in his neighborhood. Recruiting his unemployed former colleague Phil (Jeff Garlin) he starts up Daddy Day Care in his own home. In no time Charlie and Phil learn that the business of watching 4-year-olds is not easy. They destroy things these little people -- especially when you pump them full of sugary foods. They also cry and scream. And as the movie tends to point out all too often they smear their diapers mess up bathrooms and are given to flatulence. When Charlie suggests they need to add more structured activity to the day Phil retorts ""No we need Ritalin and leashes."" The plot is assured and premasticated from the get-go Charlie and Phil stumble and bumble their way into profitable paternal triumph defying the underhanded tactics of Miss Harridan who wants to stifle all competition in the preschool market. When Charlie finds himself lecturing his former employer for not listening to the needs of children when it comes to food manufacturing you know this movie has come full circle. Incidentally Charlies little evolution is all but lifted wholesale from Dustin Hoffmans similar transformation in ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" but only the baby boomer parents in the audience are likely to even notice -- assuming theyre awake at the time. ""DADDY DAY CARE"" (PG 90 minutes) -- Contains excessive bathroom humor and mild obscenity. Area theaters.

"Daddy Day Care Pop Snap and Crackle washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Movies Daddy Day Care Pop Snap and Crackle Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday May 9 2003 I suppose one could do a number on the new Eddie Murphy comedy ""Daddy Day Care."" Yeah its pretty thin and its set in a rose-colored world as viewed through rose-colored lenses. But if you attend the movie with your expectations lowered by Murphys recent films youll be reasonably amused for its trim 90-minute running time. Murphy plays Charlie Hinton a hotshot adman who works in the marketing department of a huge food company. His mission is to come up with a campaign that will convince kids that a cereal called Veggie-Os is good. Not only does he fail but in one of the movies best scenes the little brutes turn like cornered marmots on two actors in broccoli and carrot suits and pretty much beat the yogurt out of them. Well lets not belabor this Through plot manipulations too tedious to chronicle Murphy loses his job cant find another hangs out at home with his 3-year-old son while his wife (Regina King) goes off to work laments his fall with another dad (Jeff Garlin of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"") who was also fired and the next darn thing you know theyve started a day-care business. Theres one consistent joke in the film but its pretty good. It first surfaces in the Mr. Broccoli and Mr. Carrot scene The fathers disconnected from actual child-rearing their whole lives have an idealized vision of children that they have learned purely from the media in which they themselves work. Thus -- O poetic justice -- they are utterly unprepared for what they encounter. Children the movie sanely argues can be idealized only from afar. From aclose theyre belligerent irrational combative strange mean and sometimes sad and beautiful at once. So the guys struggle to keep up with reality improvising madly but completely unable to anticipate. Again an unexpected twist Schooled and experienced in marketing they try to apply marketing techniques to day care. Thus they convene the first focus group consisting entirely of 3-year-olds -- who as it turns out have very little interest in commenting on the mission statement. But then before you can say awwwwwwwwwwww this extremely predictable thing happens They realize how much they care about the unsocialized barbarians. So the movie has a lot of sweet silly kid humor -- fall down go boom who missed the potty? that sort of thing -- even as the kids continue to exceed expectations in the destruction department. They can take anything apart or get stuck in anything or disappear in a nanosecond. Give them sugar and they fly like rockets until the sugar dumps out of their blood and then they crash like rockets out of fuel. At the same time theres a little adult wit at play. For example Anjelica Huston plays a nasty vicious competing day-care provider who comes to visit Murphy. He offers her sustenance ""Would you like some coffee green tea or eye of newt?"" Okay so you have to know just a lil Shakespeare. Thats good not bad. And Jonathan Katz as a child-welfare investigator who is suddenly forced to take care of some actual kids has an excruciatingly funny scene in which he begins to explain his private neuroses to some utterly dumbfounded kids. Hes the funniest child-welfare investigator since William Daniels and Barbara Harris in the great ""A Thousand Clowns."" But Hustons good-sport turn as a woman actually named Harridan is but one of too many underdeveloped twists in the film. In another Murphy goes back to work for GenFoodCorpGMbHInc but now chastened is too moral to work on a cereal he knows will ruin kids. Then theres a barely sketched love affair between funny weird guy Steve Zahn -- the third day-care staffer -- and a young mother. And Murphys marriage to King is not merely idealized beyond recognition its as bland as any marriage on 50s TV. But when the movie is funny as it so frequently is you wont mind a bit. Daddy Day Care (90 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for mild innuendo.

This comically undernourished junk food snack should draw well initially due to expectations of Murphy tapping into his family-friendly ""Dr. Dolittle"" vein. Audiences ready willing and able to find their inner four-year-old may have a decent time at ""Daddy Day Care"" but others are likely to find Eddie Murphys latest foray into kidpicdom scarcely more amusing than spending 90 minutes in a pre-K classroom. Aimed at a ""Rugrats"" demographic of under-8-year-olds and their parents this comically undernourished junk food snack should draw well initially due to expectations of Murphy tapping into his family-friendly ""Dr. Dolittle"" vein but wont perform on the level of those animal antics or the ""Nutty Professor"" entries. ""Whats so funny?"" little Khamani Griffin who plays Murphys son balefully inquires at the end of outtakes excerpted under the closing credits. Not this film unfortunately and that neatly sums up the problem with this tale of two upper-middle-class suburban gents who react to their sudden unemployment by venturing into ""professional"" childcare. The work of first-time scenarist Geoff Rodkeys script could and should have been stoked by a raft of glib experts at situation comedy and one-liners. As the meager story plays out the situations are there but not the comedy leaving the result feeling like an early draft quickly and mechanically executed. The best one can say for ""Daddy Day Care"" is that it is less crude than the ""Dolittle"" pictures the second of which was directed by present helmer Steve Carr and that the kids dont act like little monsters for the entire running time. When well-paid ad execs Charlie Hinton (Murphy) and Phil (Jeff Garlin) are downsized after an excruciatingly unamusing routine in vegetable costumes meant to promote a breakfast cereal Charlie and his wife Kim (Regina King) are forced to pull their son Ben out of pricey Chapman Academy. With Kim going back to work child care duties fall to Charlie who takes to hanging out at the playground with Phil and his kid. Brainstorm of opening a daycare center at Charlies home generates initial skepticism but instant business among neighborhood moms happy for a few hours off. The first day is a disaster of course The clueless guys have no activities planned Phil refuses to deal with toilet issues even where his own son is concerned and his all-purpose solution to any behavioral problem is child bribery.In the scripts most ridiculous notion parents who once craved only the toniest establishment for their children suddenly decide the free-for-all over at the Hinton household is more appealing they yank their kids out of Chapman (and forfeit the tuition theyve paid). Natch this doesnt go down well with Chapmans headmistress the subtly named Gwyneth Harridan (Anjelica Huston in archest mode) who plots revenge first by sending over a Child Services inspector (nicely played in efficacious milquetoast mode by Jonathan Katz) then more viciously by sabotaging a Hinton fund raiser. Centers future is truly put on the line when Charlie is offered a new job and hes forced to decide whats really important to him. Penalty for guessing wrong about what he concludes is being forced to watch the film all over again. Along with presenting numb-skulled caricatures of the differences between traditional and progressive schooling pic recycles the most cliched and conventional modern notions about child rearing and life priorities all laid out in blandly impersonal fashion by director Carr. The fate meted out to the villainous Miss Harridan is preposterous even in this buffoonish context. Murphy plays his high-flying professional man brought down to Earth in relatively subdued fashion with no nutty edge. Garlin of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" is just OK in the John Goodman/Tom Arnold sidekick role but if there is ever a need for anyone to play Harvey Weinstein Garlin may just be the guy. Kings virtual disappearance from the picture after the first reel makes her mother role all but irrelevant while Steve Zahn is less manic and inventive than usual as a reluctant single friend recruited to round out the day care staff who turns out to have an intuitive connection to little kids. Craft contributions are efficient at best. Daddy Day CareProductionA Sony Pictures Entertainment release of a Columbia Pictures/Revolution Studios presentation of a Davis Entertainment production.

I have also come to count on family-themed projects as the most nurturing environment for Murphys pinwheeling energy When he focuses his abundant but distractable talent in the service of younger viewers hes capable of satisfying successes like ""Dr. Dolittle"" ""The Nutty Professor"" ""Mulan"" and the giant ""Shrek."" (When hes squandering his gifts the result is hell like ""Holy Man."") My radar is busted though by Daddy Day Care a parent-and-kid-oriented comedy about the adventures of men doing the hard work of mommies which couldnt be more timely - or less delightful. In the same week that a Newsweek cover story identifies a boom in stay-at-home dads - many of them laid off from their jobs in todays weak economy - whose wives bring in the paychecks Murphy plays Charlie Hinton a hooked-up well-paid ad guy axed from his agency. Charlies idea of quality time with his 4-year-old son is a quick toss in the air but a keen instinct for profit quickly overrides the humility of his parenting inexperience Reluctantly babysitting while his wife (Regina King) tootles off to her own good job as an attorney Charlie along with Phil a fellow pink-slipped-colleague-with-kid (""Curb Your Enthusiasm""s appealing lunkhead Jeff Garlin) identifies a niche-market need for an affordable alternative to the pricey snooty local charm school for tots (run by Anjelica Huston as a cartoonish gorgon who might take tea with Cruella De Vil). The two business big shots set themselves up as day-care providers. And they learn of course that implementing corporate mission statements is easy; implementing nap time is hard. That smack-on-the-forehead revelation however isnt enough to sustain the movie which settles for cataloging average kiddie antics (that any mother the movie implies could handle while multitasking) contrasting this preschool behavior with the dum-dum-hood of educated affluent men. Only an overgrown boobish boy himself doesnt know that a kid who gorges on sugar snacks is a kid who bounces off walls. Yet Charlie and Phil - who surely grew up watching postfeminist free-to-be-you-and-me childrens TV - master each lesson (Diapers are stinky Reading stories aloud is good) as if they were cracking a Harvard Business School case study. The scrum of child actors (many of whom make their movie debuts here) are good enough at playing clingy or precocious or shy or rude or shin-kicking pint-size individuals. The adult actors though crawl without security blankets through a playpen script by Geoff Rodkey (who once stayed home with his son while his wife worked) and Simon Says direction by Steve Carr (""Dr. Dolittle 2""). For the record the biggest laughs in the family-filled screening I attended went to a kick in the crotch administered by a small child to a large man - the last refuge as Dr. Spock and Mr. Rogers knew well of grown-up moviemakers in need of a time-out.
