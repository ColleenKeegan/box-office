"Grudge Match When Did De Niro Get Interested in Actually Acting Again? << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Grudge Match When Did De Niro Get Interested in Actually Acting Again? Warner Bros. Kevin Hart December 24 2013 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print You see the posters for Grudge Match and know exactly how the pitch meeting went ""Its Rocky versus Raging Bull"" But that gets you no further than a Super Bowl ad. And maybe Grudge Match shouldve lasted 60 seconds but its a nearly two-hour movie that shakes loose of that pitch and puts some effort into the comedy. As a film its far from necessary. I mean the demand to see a Balboa-La Motta fight is a campy urban myth of Alien vs. Predator proportions. But by the time Sylvester Stallone and Robert De Niro start training for the big match -- its called Grudgment Day -- you give in because surprisingly both actors have reported for duty especially De Niro. He plays Billy ""The Kid"" McDonnen. Billy used to box. Now he owns a Pittsburgh car dealership and a neighborhood restaurant. De Niros ready to roll from his first couple of scenes. He crashes into a video-game motion-capture session eager to banter with his old nemesis Henry ""Razor"" Sharp the stoic and broke steelworker slab that Stallone plays. Billy doesnt know he looks ridiculous in green tights and Velcroed Ping-Pong balls. He just wants to mix it up with Razor. Billy still thinks Razor did him wrong in their last fight (its been 30 years) and they wind up destroying the gaming studio in a melee that makes them Internet sensations. Their spike in popularity leads to a highly touted sold-out rematch promoted by a loudmouth played by Kevin Hart. When De Niros feeling good in a scene he does the face people make when they want to ""do De Niro"" the precipitous open-mouthed frown. Its the facial equivalent of a landslide. Claims that hes been mailing it in over the years are overstated. Of course he hasnt exactly helped with his choices. He has made a shtick out of playing grizzled curmudgeons. But lately hes been full of life. Here and in Last Vegas and The Family hes been vigorous and intimidating again. Who can say why? But his energy helps take the movie beyond embarrassment to semi-legitimate entertainment. This part is similar to the grouch he played in Last Vegas except that character was actually from Brooklyn instead of just sounding like he is. There he was dueling Michael Douglas for Mary Steenburgen. Grudge Match dusts off a love triangle featuring Billy Razor and a stunningly well-preserved blonde named Sally whos played by Kim Basinger. The particulars arent worth going into. Suffice it to say that her mid-thirties son B.J. (Jon Bernthal) is Billys but her heart belongs to Razor. Theres something charming about how estranged everybody is. B.J. doesnt know Billy but their schnozzes connect them. Razor hasnt seen Sally in decades yet hasnt stopped thinking about her nor she him. Is it nonsense that these people all live in the same smallish city but it has taken something called ""Grudgment Day"" to connect them? Is it strange that a woman of Basingers fine-boned beauty would produce a sweet-natured bruiser like Bernthal? Of course it is But the film doesnt make you think too hard about it. The screenplay is credited to Tim Kelleher and Rodney Rothman and directed by Peter Segal who has done some dreadful comedies (The Longest Yard Get Smart) but shows some good human touch here. The movie is more interested in what all this reconnection means emotionally. Its almost touching to see B.J. enjoy training Billy. (Alan Arkin plays the uncouth codger who trains Razor.) You also get why Sally might have slept with Billy (whos still a jerk) when really she loved Razor (hes a lug). You also understand why De Niro is so eager to go after Stallone. To start Rocky stole Taxi Drivers Best Picture Oscar. But the need to fight roils both their characters as powerfully as romantic love does other people. And the fight itself is something to see. I imagine that one advantage of a boxing movie starring two men well past their athletic peaks is that you gain a kind of authenticity in letting them appear to throw their own punches. They look very much as if they hurt. The match is remarkable because its better than you hoped and less pathetic sad or creepy than you expected. These two guys mean it. The film critic Lisa Schwarzbaum wrote an amusing and astute essay for The New York Times Magazine about the exasperating absurd proliferation of movies in which old oldish middle-aged and middle-agedish men do one last thing -- Space Cowboys Wild Hogs The Hangover Last Vegas and to some extent Stallones The Expendables. Schwarzbaums point applies here too. And yet the movie succeeds despite the problematic fantasy it propagates. Theres simply the pleasure of seeing De Niro do more exclamation-point acting and being reminded that when hes not defending American movie masculinity with gassy action films and conducting experiments on his body and face Stallone is still a star. The closer he gets to a boxing ring the more alive he becomes. His stroll into the arena is one of the most effortlessly confident incidentally sexy things you might watch an actor do. Seeing him in the gloves and robe we know what Sally fell for all those years ago. We know because we fell too. That slab was once a king.

He brings a frenetic energy to the proceedings jolting the film from its stupor landing one-liner after one-liner all in a herculean effort to salvage otherwise bad material. ""This Kevin Hart guy"" you find yourself thinking at some point in the movie ""is doing well"". Having said that theres perhaps theres one more thing you should know regarding Kevin Harts performance hes only in about 20 minutes of this fiasco which runs nearly two hours. Ruh-roh. Long-retired boxer Henry Razor Sharp (Sylvester Stallone) works in what would seem to be a steel refinery in beautiful Pittsburgh PA. Hes a hardscrabble type gruff and not prone to using his words. He doesnt own a television but if he had he might have noticed that ESPN aired an anniversary segment chronicling his famous match with Billy The Kid McDonnen (Robert De Niro) some 30 years prior. This was a rivalry for the ages the second pugilistic war between the men and when the final bell sounded Sharp had defeated McDonnen to even the record between the two titans. The third match was to decide the ultimate victor only this match never happened lost to mysterious motivations on the part of Sharp who backed out of the fight. And now? Billy The Kid McDonnen owns a boxing-themed restaurant and car dealership while Razor Sharp works at the aforementioned plant and has avoided the limelight for three decades. Enter Dante Slate Jr. (Kevin Hart mercifully) into the equation. Slates dad Sr. was the promoter who put together the original McDonnen-Sharp matches and in the grand tradition of boxing he was also the guy that ripped everyone off. Young Dante has nothing to do with dad (whom in the film has ceased to be) but hes got an offer for the two grizzled prizefighters an easy score thousands of dollars to do some green screen work for a new boxing game. Sharp reluctantly agrees and McDonnen happily signs on (he wants to see/fight Sharp in the worst way possible) which sets the stage for a new era in their relationship. They are supposed to come to the game studio at different times to record their motion capture but instead they overlap and a video of the fracas they get into goes viral. Which naturally leads to people wanting to see them fight again all these many years later. Premise established All of this would basically be okay I mean theres been shoddier setups for movies that ended up decent but the problem here is the reliance on the most tired of plot devices; accomplishing nothing more than the elongation of the film. Heres the even more strange part Sharp (Stallone) plays a boxer that simply quit disappearing from the public eye with no regret in his late 30s (Ill bang the irony gong when youre ready). Thus the ""suspense"" of the film if one was feeling generous boils down to 1) Why Sharp quit and 2) Nothing else. No wait Theres a romantic angle too in the form of Kim Basinger as a gal named Sally who was romantically intertwined with both gents. She has a son too who just happens to be McDonnens and again if one was feeling kind you could say ""Grudge Match"" is about the idea of their estrangement. Really youd say neither though because no one is that accommodating and ""Grudge Match"" isnt about romance or father/son because its mostly about preparing for the eventual match; a batch of scenes adding up to nothing less than horrid. Enter Alan Arkin as Sharps trainer. His role in the film seems to be just to tell us everyone involved is old just in case we hadnt noticed this salient fact prior. Indeed the main tactic of ""Grudge Match"" seems to be to deal with the elephant in the room that everyone about to punch each other is pushing 70 by turning the whole film into an elephant room. Its almost like the child who gets an F on a test and to distract everyone from his poor performance he decides to light the garage on fire. Tricked ya But by doing this you begin to viscerally hate the people involved and become unsure as to why exactly these two are hopping back into the ring. There are plenty of training montages all slightly repetitive and rote plus more than a few ""dramatic"" scenes involving what it means to be a dad or exploring why someone who loved you 30 years ago hasnt spoken to you since. Sad drivel these. There are also the scenes where we see that hey these old guys have still got ""it"" but then as if somehow overtly embarrassed and self-aware ""Grudge Match"" will pivot right back to a prostate or fiber joke. By wanting to cede the whole thing is slightly ridiculous ""Grudge Match"" then plays as slightly pointless which couldnt have been their intent. Really theyd have been better off playing it not for laughs because the most impressive moments in the film came from mining the idea that these were warriors who happened to be aging not old guys trying to fit into warrior costumes. Truly Stallone has the physique and charm to pull off a film like this and Im pretty sure Robert De Niro could still pummel most of us into submission without even breaking a sweat. Remarkably the flesh was willing it was the writing and spirit that was unable to piece together anything nearing a coherent narrative. The last ten minutes are pretty solid once the finally fight gets underway as are the times when Kevin Hart is being Kevin Hart. Everything else? Like a swollen fighters eye it shoulda been cut. SCORE 3.2 / 10 Laremy wrote the book on film criticism and unless they used CGI can do less pull-ups than Bobby De Niro.

"Review Grudge Match with Stallone and De Niro cant land KO blow - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Grudge Match with Stallone and De Niro cant land KO blow ""Grudge Match"" Ben Rothstein / Warner Bros. Sylvester Stallone left and Robert De Niro star in ""Grudge Match."" Sylvester Stallone left and Robert De Niro star in ""Grudge Match."" (Ben Rothstein / Warner Bros.) Mark Olsen Few of us will know what it means to have a genuine legacy something that really needs to be cared for protected regarded. Performers such as Robert De Niro and Sylvester Stallone must know that issue all too well each having created a coterie of legendary characters in their long careers.So in the new film ""Grudge Match"" which plays with the imagery and iconography of two of their best-known creations are we all sharing a wink and a laugh as the points of reference somehow add something deeper to our understanding? Or are they diverting our attention while reaching into our pockets in a cheap hustle? Maybe both? Directed by Peter Segal from a script credited to Tim Kelleher and Rodney Rothman the film sets Stallone and De Niro against each other as onetime rivals in the boxing ring who never had a third and deciding bout. Stallones Henry ""Razor"" Sharp has lived a quiet workmans life out of the spotlight at a steel mill in the 30 years since while De Niros Billy ""The Kid"" McDonnen has milked his fame for every last drop of money and attention. Circumstances bring them together one more time for a rematch that starts as something of a joke and cash-grab (sound familiar?) and winds up meaning more to the both of them.PHOTOS Extreme celebrity weight transformations for roles The movie is betting that audiences will get a kick out of seeing Rocky Balboa and Jake ""Raging Bull"" LaMotta duking it out at last. The play on actors and their screen personas brings to mind Marlon Brando in ""The Freshman"" where without the winking regard for the actors role in ""The Godfather"" the film would scarcely exist. Or as in the recent ""The Family"" where a character played by De Niro watches De Niros film ""Goodfellas.""""Grudge Match"" never settles on the movie it wants to be wavering uncertainly between a jokey old-guys comedy and something more dramatic and heartfelt. It never lands the combination of being both. Alan Arkin and Kevin Hart are funny in supporting roles but pitch the story too broadly particularly in contrast to Jon Bernthals storyline as De Niros long-lost son.At times it seems as if De Niro and Stallone are performing in different movies. De Niro chuckles his way through the role with the same deprecating self-regard as many of his recent comedies. Stallone has a few unexpectedly strong dramatic scenes opposite Kim Basinger as the woman who got between Razor and the Kid showing the genuine soulfulness that has often made Stallone a compelling performer even in his worst movies.PHOTOS Mark Olsens top picks for 2013 Building to a fight that is a bit more sluggish than slugfest ""Grudge Match"" can never figure out just what its trying to prove. Pleasant but underwhelming it feels like something that belongs on the undercard never reaching the heights of a main event. The characters of Rocky Balboa and Jake LaMotta still exist elsewhere their respective legacies unsullied. But such iconic characters and this includes Stallone and De Niro deserve better.---Grudge MatchMPAA rating PG-13 for sports action violence sexual content and languageRunning time 1 hour 54 minutesPlaying In wide releasemark.olsenlatimes.com PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Robert De Niro Sylvester Stallone Reviews Jon Bernthal Tim Kelleher Kenneth Turans best feature films of 2013 Review Scorsese DiCaprio go hunting in Wolf of Wall Street Review August Osage County dysfunction doesnt play on film stage Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad71deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-grudge-match-review-sylvester-stallone-robert-de-niro-20131225,0,3821730.story#axzz2ob03fVID",200,grudgematch2,grudgematch,latimes

Grudge Match review Boxers caught in ring of revenge 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Grudge Match Comedy-drama. Starring Sylvester Stallone Robert De Niro Alan Arkin and Kevin Hart. Directed by Peter Segal. (PG-13. 113 minutes.) ""Grudge Match"" at its core is an affront to the cinema gods an attempt to capitalize off two iconic films for a few cheap laughs. Were accustomed to seeing the now 67-year-old Sylvester Stallone wring a few more dollars from his fictional boxing alter ego Rocky Balboa. Robert De Niro resurrecting the ghosts of ""Raging Bull"" on the same screen is arguably the greater career decision felony. But beyond the initial blunders most of the subsequent decisions regarding this film were actually pretty good. ""Grudge Match"" sets the right tone embracing a nice balance of crowd-pleasing comedy and lightweight family drama. Stallone in particular seems to be making a legitimate effort. The supporting actors are solid throughout. Stallone and De Niro are Pittsburgh boxers Henry ""Razor"" Sharp and Billy ""The Kid"" McDonnen who split two huge fights against each other in the 1970s. Razor and Kid are as close in background and demeanor to Rocky Balboa and Jake LaMotta as the writers could get without worrying about an intellectual property lawyer knocking on the door. Money problems (for Razor) and closure issues (for The Kid) lure them to a third fight which is initially treated as a joke but starts to gain traction. Kim Basinger plays the romantic interest who was once in love with Razor before a too-convenient misunderstanding which assumes that both lovers were incapable of operating a phone or penning a letter for 30 years. The script alternates between gags and heart-tugging plot turns which both have their hits and misses. Stallone in particular has a good time playing off the old cliches. ""Do they still do this?"" Razor remarks after a trainer cracks raw eggs in a glass and hands them over. ""It seems like a lot of cholesterol ..."" Kevin Hart adds a welcome youthful edge to the comedy as their desperately broke fight promoter. Alan Arkin and Jon Bernthal are solid as Razors aging trainer and The Kids estranged son. Both the comedy and story turns are maddeningly predictable. A screwup by The Kid while babysitting is especially poorly written. And did anyone think there wouldnt be an uncomfortable proctology exam in this film? Theres also a weird apples-and-oranges thing going on with the performances. Stallone is spoofing the fictitious Balboa while De Niro does a send-up of himself as LaMotta a real person. A real person who was arrested for a crime involving an underage girl at his nightclub. Which takes some of the humor away from The Kids bar hookup scene ... But there are surprises as well including a well-played visit to a UFC match where the mixed-martial arts organizers and light heavyweight Chael Sonnen prove they both have an outstanding sense of humor. The big fight itself has some nice turns. Best of all ""Grudge Match"" has a pervasive positivity that plays well in this angst-filled holiday movie season. It feels a little like watching Rocky Balboa and Jake LaMotta performing ""The Gift of the Magi"" in a dinner theater setting - a scene which may or may not turn up in the sequel. One more point for ""Grudge Match"" The post-credits sequence involving Harts next fight is one of the best in recent memory. We will give nothing else away except to say that its pretty close in greatness to ""The Avengers"" shawarma coda. Peter Hartlaub is The San Francisco Chronicles pop culture critic.

Comments click to enlarge Grudge Match Video Rated PG-13  114 minutes  2013 Robert De Niro 70 and Sylvester Stallone 67 parody their old boxing pictures in this geezer comedy recycled from Neil Simons The Sunshine Boys. Instead of an old vaudeville team theyre aging Pittsburgh palookas who fought each other for the light heavyweight title three decades earlier and now through the increasingly common plot device of a viral video win the chance to pummel each other again in a lucrative exhibition match. The jokes are clumsy the dramatic scenes stale and lifeless; like the climactic bout the movie itself is a freak show a fantasy matchup between two icons with nothing better to do than spend down their legacies.

"Grudge Match 2 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article Grudge Match 2 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Tue Dec 24 2013 1132 AM Robert De Niro and Sylvester Stallone starred in two of the great boxing movies of all time ""Raging Bull"" and ""Rocky. If you plan to see ""Grudge Match"" its best that you put those memories out of mind. Far far out of your mind. This is a wretched movie trading on characters we revere yet doing nothing to honor them. Director Peter Segal tries everything he can to recapture the magic of the earlier movies but to no avail. Its all rather sad. Billy ""The Kid"" McDonnen (De Niro) and Henry ""Razor"" Sharp were Ali-Frazier-like opponents 30 years ago. Their first fight was epic with the Kid winning in a brutal match. Razor won the second with lingering doubts that the Kid hadnt trained hard enough and wasnt prepared for the rematch. There would be no third fight. The Kid abruptly announced his retirement and settled in for a life of drinking owning car dealerships and a restaurantand living off his reputation. Razor had a tougher go of it losing most of his money and having to go back to work in the steel mills. (Both men live in Pittsburgh.) Then along comes Dante Slate Jr. (Kevin Hart) the son of the promoter for the first two Kid-Razor bouts. At first he wants the aging fighters to provide motion-capture action and voices for a video game. But when a tussle in the studio goes viral online he senses there might be more lingering interest in the two men than he realized. A fight 30 years after the Kid retired is scheduled. The rest of the movie is spent with the two old out-of-condition men getting into shape for the long-awaited rematch with a little cliched backstory thrown in for good measure. (Yes they are way to old for this kind of thing but you just have to kind of go with it -- thats part of it.) Razor enlists his old trainer Louis ""Lightning"" Conlon (Alan Arkin). The Kid turns to a rookie trainer B.J. (Jon Bernthal) for reasons involving the original rift between the Kid and Razor. Also thrown into that mix is Kim Basinger as Sally Razors former flame. Theyre all tangled up in a melodramatic mess none of which is intriguing. There are a few references to Stallone and De Niros boxing-film legacy a couple of which are kind of funny by themselves -- you could probably stitch together a pretty decent trailer out of them -- but in the overall context they just add to the pathetic nature of it all. With movies like ""The Expendables"" Stallone seems bound and determined to bring attention to his age (hes 67). Fair enough but if the movies arent good what does it really mean? Meanwhile De Niro 70 shows in an uncredited appearance in the great ""American Hustle"" that he still has the terrifyingly good chops he had in his earlier films. Just dont look for them or anything else of note in ""Grudge Match."" Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter twitter.com/goodyk.

"Grudge Match | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; grudge-match ) Grudge Match (United States 2013) December 24 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Back in the 1980s when Sylvester Stallone was at his peak and the Rocky movies were arriving at regular intervals there was an ongoing joke that 20 or 30 years from then Stallone would be doing Rocky 15 with the pugilist using a walker to get around the ring. Dont look now... Actually the underlying premise of Grudge Match is appealing even if the execution is lackluster. It would seem to be an easy sell get the stars of two of the most enduring boxing movies of the late-70s/early-80s to do a comedic sort-of reprise of those characters 30 years later. Stallone doesnt play Rocky and Robert De Niro isnt Raging Bulls Jake La Motta but anyone with a modicum of movie experience will make the connection. For those who miss it there are plenty of callbacks to some of the iconic moments of the Rocky films (although fewer if any to Raging Bull - I guess the best-known scene from that film is too profane to adapt for a PG-13 audience). I kept expecting to hear ""Gonna Fly Now."" (Its absence is curious - couldnt Warner Brothers get the rights?) Grudge Match postulates that in the 80s there was no bigger rivalry than the one between Pittsburgh natives Billy ""The Kid"" McDonnen (De Niro) and Henry ""Razor"" Sharp (Stallone). They fought two big matches with split results. The third bout never happened because Razor unexpectedly retired. Now 30 years later along comes promoter Dante Slate Jr. (Kevin Hart) trying to put together a ""grudge match"" between the two. Capitalizing on YouTube videos and cheesy promotional opportunities he drums up enough interest in the fight to sell out a 5000-seat venue. The Kid is on board from the start - he always wanted the chance to prove himself to be the best. Razor is reluctant but he needs the money to help out his friend and ex-trainer Lightning (Alan Arkin). Entering the mix is Sally Rose (Kim Basinger) Razors ex-girlfriend who slept with The Kid and The Kids now-grown son BJ (Jon Bernthal). When the movie focuses on comedy and parody its on relatively solid ground. There are no knock-out punches but its funny in a genial Grumpy Old Men style. The drama is weak and unconvincing even by sit-com standards. Nevertheless Grudge Match is enjoyable in an undemanding fashion until it crashes and burns at the end. The big boxing match is an embarrassment in every way. Its not just the awkward sight of two senior citizens duking it out in the ring that strikes a sour note but the narrative of how this match develops is hideously wrong. Done with a slightly different approach this could have been biting satire but director Peter Segal makes the catastrophic mistake of playing things straight and thats fatal. Still if you go sit through the big fight because the movies two best scenes occur during the end credits. De Niro has become so associated with comedies that its no longer hard to see him slumming in something like this. In fact The Kid is synonymous with De Niros current image. Its a little bizarre seeing him reach back 33 years to resurrect a comedic version of La Motta. Meanwhile Stallone plays the films straight man and as with all straight men hes not supposed to be funny. The jokes are primarily at his expense. So it works. On balance Stallones incorporation in Grudge Match works better than De Niros - not because hes a better actor (which obviously isnt the case) but because the Rocky image is more easily mined that the lesser-known one of La Motta. The movie opens with some of the ugliest attempts at de-aging imaginable. In an attempt to represent The Kid and Razor as they were in their heyday Segal uses old footage bad CGI shaky-cam shots and unconvincing doubles to recreate the ""classic"" 80s bouts. Its astonishing how bad this material looks and it gets Grudge Match off on the wrong foot. 90 minutes later after the film has mostly recovered from a shameful beginning it does something equally unpardonable. On balance I think Id rather have seen Rocky 15.

Entertainment Inc. - All Rights Reserved. The surprise in Grudge Match the not-quite-a-comedy that pits Rocky Balboa against Raging Bull isnt that it has the chutzpah to posit a universe in which Sylvester Stallone and Robert De Niro have since the early 80s been equally matched rivals. The surprise is in how easily audiences will buy it. For years De Niro has slumped through godawful comedies where he seems to work just about as hard as a high school coach teaching health class. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - A decade and a half of that and Grudge Match almost makes sense. The greatest of street-tough 70s Noo Yawk film actors has sunk to the level of Stallone the most ridiculous of that breed. Despite Silver Linings Playbook De Niros the one who most seems to need a slot on this fight card -- Stallone has three dutifully violent franchises to tend to and Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot is a lot smaller in his rearview than Meet the Fockers is in De Niros.An even bigger surprise Despite the scene where De Niros retirement-age pugilist farts on his trainer Grudge Match aspires to be more than some Jack Lemmon/Walter Matthau-style dispenser of prostate jokes. Director Peter Segal is aiming for nothing less than the third-best boxing movie these guys have ever starred in. It might be but thats only a compliment if you favor the flags-and-muscle candy of those hulking Rocky sequels.Film Details Grudge Match RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time113 More Info Grudge Match like Rocky Balboa is drab and plodding as a matter of principle. Its boxers live in Pittsburgh a city often typecast in the role of Hard Times in America; true to form Stallones washed-up fighter works at a factory facing layoffs and squints at the burger hes served in a grimy diner -- the pattys no thicker than a shingle.A fake sportscast dishes the backstory Back in 82 after theyd each won one title match from the other Stallones character chose to retire from boxing rather than face De Niros in a tie-breaker. The voiceover announces that no one knows why which means you better steel yourself for some mopey revelations to come -- and they drip out slowly this being a Stallone character. If you always sounded like you just left the dentist youd be taciturn too.De Niro plays a bar owner across town a loudmouth who takes to the stage with schtick-y stand-up act based on his fight career. When the two men meet for the first time in years they lurch into a dumb improbable brawl. Some whippersnapper uploads the fracas to YouTube -- the movies idea of a joke is that the old-timers have never heard of ""viral"" videos -- and soon a promoter (Kevin Hart) is pushing the two toward the grudge match of the title and a windfall of tens of thousands of dollars.Cue the usual training montages complete with Stallone performing his trademark feats of strength plus much melodrama centered around family and exes and Alan Arkin turning up as an Alan Arkin type -- hes the same foulmouthed salt he played in Stand Up Guys right down to doing double duty as inspirational speechmaker and comic-relief grotesque. Nimble Arkin handles those shifts better than the film does; Segals gearbox gets jammed between recession-era sports drama and brainless comedy especially as Hart hollers pop-culture punch lines like hes the squirrel sidekick in a CGI kiddo flick.Credit Segal with this though He elicits an engaged and engaging performance from De Niro whos good even compelling when the dialogues worth his time. The many passages when it isnt offer the chance to contemplate a curious similarity between these two actors Each has protected the key instrument of his individual craft while not worrying much about the other. De Niros face is still wonderfully expressive its deep lines cinching up with anger or spreading wide with his loose lively laughter. His body meanwhile is subjected to punishing jokes about man-boobs gassiness and Jake LaMotta-style bloat.Stallone meanwhile remains ripped his chest thrust forward like Captain Americas shield although he looks more human than he sometimes has -- hes at least back on HO scale. But his face has so pinked as its settled into slack immobility that his eyes and mouth at times seem to be just holes in meat. He plays the relatable one the everyday schlub who once was a contender. But whats the point of a movie about an everyman aging whose star has done everything in his power to look like he hasnt?By the end weve seen both these joes were supposed to root for punch out strapping bruisers less than half their age. (De Niro knocks down LL Cool J -- twice) Even crazier Stallones training scenes peak with him dragging a tractor-trailers cab across a junkyard -- and you thought The Hobbit was the seasons big fantasy picture. The climactic title bout is woozy with blood and sweat and debilitating head injuries just like the old days. This De Niro and this Stallone may suit each other but for all the punching and tear-jerking nothing in here comes close to the excitement of De Niros younger self having coffee with Pacino in Heat. Now that was a duel.2 Photo by Ben Rothstein - (c) 2013 Warner Bros.

The unstated but obvious conceit of Grudge Match is to pit the two great movie boxers of the early eighties -- Rocky Balboa and Jake La Motta -- against each other. ""The aging palooka versus the aging psychotic"" is not actually a terrible idea for a comedy but somewhere along the way somebody decided to make this a movie about urban despair and senior regret. The result is maybe more interesting than we might have expected but its not particularly funny. Needless to say this isnt really Rocky versus Raging Bull.A  Sylvester Stallone is Henry ""Razor"" Sharp and Robert De Niro is Billy ""The Kid"" McDonnen two Pittsburgh fighters renowned for their bitter rivalry. Its been 30 years however since theyve had a chance at each other. In the intervening years Razor has gone back to work at the local steel mill and the Kid has become a restaurateur and car salesman. But now the hard-on-his-luck son of their former boxing promoter played by a typically motor-mouthed Kevin Hart has a great idea bring the two oldsters back into the ring and reap the profits. If you think about it his scheme is pretty much what the film itself is doing. As expected there are a lot of old-age jokes here. Like a lot of old-age jokes. As if having Stallone and De Niro delivering them werent enough the movie also offers up Alan Arkin doing his usual (and very very tired) Profane Grandpa thing as Razors aging trainer. As for the leads Stallone does more with his part than De Niro does. Hes well-suited for this aging loser role and he also seems more willing to rib his image too. (I wonder if hes upping his game because he knows hes going up against De Niro not realizing that this is the De Niro who does bland comedies and not quite the guy who played La Motta and Travis Bickle.) There are gags here around Razor doing Rocky-like things like pulling heavy machinery beating sides of beef and drinking raw eggs. Youve probably seen some of these in the trailer. Well have no fear There are lots more of them in the movie too. De Niro is less willing to go there -- probably because Raging Bull is a far more sacred cinematic cow than Rocky ever was and were already angry at him for not making more Scorsese movies. But still if you squint you can see in his paunchy car salesman and bar owner a watered-down version of the nightclub impresario La Motta became in his doughy punch-drunk later years. Its probably blasphemy to say this but I wish theyd done more with this maybe brought Joe Pesci back or had some weird fun at the self-destructive La Mottas expense. It can be done; Brando once winningly riffed on his The Godfather role in the Matthew Broderick comedy The Freshman and his good humor was infectious. Anyway if thats the joke you might as well have some fun with it. But Grudge Match is anything but fun. In fact its deliberately grungy with lots of time spent wallowing in the blighted industrial landscape of Pittsburgh. This isnt entirely a bad thing. Theres something mildly compelling about the sad-sack quality of the characters and their down-and-out town. Director Peter Segal is a journeyman who cut his teeth doing TV comedy specials then made a couple of comedy sequels and some not-terrible Adam Sandler movies (50 First Dates The Longest Yard etc.). For all the anonymity of his filmography he actually brings some personality and atmosphere to the movie. To what end though? Amid the urban bleakness and the old-age jokes Grudge Match suffers from a distinct lack of energy. By the time the climactic bout arrives we feel more worried than energized. Thats partly the point of course and the fight is indeed a pretty brutal one. But theres still a real tonal incongruity here between zany high concept and soft-touch execution. Mixing comedy and drama is one thing but Grudge Match is not quite serious enough to make us care and not lively enough to make us laugh.

While the Kid has made a living as a small-business owner and Razor has ascetically been punching the clock in a Pittsburgh factory it doesnt take much prompting (or screen time) for them to resume their love-triangle-fueled rivalry fueled by the formers pursuit of redemption and the latters need to reconcile with a lost love (Kim Basinger). Even by low standards Grudge Match is astonishingly undercooked. The problem isnt a lack of surprise--theres some pleasure in knowing where this is headed--but an indifference to even going through the motions between obligatory training montages and ageist put-downs. What redeems the film (if not Kevin Harts siren-blasted jive as a Napoleonic promoter) is the commitment our elder heroes bring to exposing the dings in their once-formidable armor. The 70-year-old De Niro exhibits zero vanity--the former Raging Bull now spars like a punching-nun doll--and while the 67-year-old Stallones melted-wax mug can be hard to look at hes still every bit the Italian Stallion in a silk robe.

(Photo by Ben Rothstein) By Stephanie Merry December 24 2013 Follow stephmerry Most actors fight being pigeonholed. Sylvester Stallone punched his way into being typecast and isnt rushing to abandon his perch. In the past 37 years hes portrayed among other macho muscle-bound characters boxer Rocky Balboa six times (with another opportunity reportedly on the way) and what does he do in the meantime? He stars in ""Grudge Match"" as Henry ""Razor"" Sharp a former light heavyweight champ. Razor inexplicably fled the sport in his heyday avoiding a tie-breaking fight with longtime rival Billy ""The Kid"" McDonnen (played by Robert De Niro also a boxer portrayer but with a decidedly more diverse resume). Slys still got it -- when it comes to action. Razor is lured out of retirement for the bout he evaded three decades earlier and all the requisite training scenes -- the jabbing and jogging raw-egg-swilling and truck-pulling -- are nearly as exhilarating as they were in 1976. All these years later the 67-year-old Stallone still looks the part with his tattooed barrel chest and ability to believably land a punch. Stallones acting however is a little rusty. With his garbled delivery he never was a paragon of emotional depth but now his frozen face only exacerbates his shortcomings when the comedic drama turns serious. Even the more lighthearted scenes can be problematic. When Razor and the Kid are supposed to be publicly promoting their bout and instead devolve into bickering buffoonery theres nothing but ill-timed punch lines where the chemistry between Stallone and De Niro should be. Luckily a strong supporting cast makes up for the protagonists tepid interactions. The brilliant duo of Kevin Hart and Alan Arkin steal the show as the fight organizer and Razors dirty-old-man trainer respectively. When these two get into it laugh-out-loud hysterics follow. Meanwhile Jon Bernthal (from AMCs ""The Walking Dead"") steps up to remind viewers how dramatic acting should look playing the Kids estranged son. The Kid isnt much of a father nor is he a particularly good person although there are momentary flashes of his humanity. Hes a mostly two-dimensional character and Stallone might have been better cast in the role. As it is Razor is the more likable of the two but theres an inverse correlation between each scenes potential for enjoyment and the number of lines Stallone has to say. For example nearly wordless sight gags involving the pair fighting while wearing green unitards and a skydiving adventure gone awry garner laughs. Less effective is a romantic subplot between Razor and a former girlfriend played by Kim Basinger. While this season has featured a wealth of great dramatic movies everyone needs a break from the seriousness now and then. ""Grudge Match"" serves that function. It has its flaws with a star who does the sometimes-silly script few favors. But you have to hand it to Stallone and his enduring career. Its amazing that hes still kicking not to mention punching.

"Grudge Match Stallone-De Niro matchup packs no punch Review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesGrudge Match Stallone-De Niro matchup packs no punch ReviewPredictable and unfunny Grudge Match which teams Sylvester Stallone and Robert De Niro as aging boxing rivals fails to score even a TKO.Robert De Niro left and Sylvester Stallone put on the gloves in Grudge Match.  (warner bros.)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterTues. Dec. 24 2013Grudge MatchStarring Sylvester Stallone Robert De Niro Alan Arkin Kevin Hart Kim Basinger and Jon Bernthal. Directed Peter Segal. 113 minutes. Opens Dec. 25 at major theatres. 14A Does the punch you see coming hurt any less?So too with Grudge Match a cliched imagination-free slog that puts Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) and Raging Bulls Jake LaMotta (Robert De Niro) in the ring together.Article Continued BelowThe path of this slimly written half-hearted comedy is obvious from the first bell. Boxing flick Grudge Match reeks not of ringside liniment and sweat but rather a late-career cash grab for its stars as they exploit far better work done years earlier.Even their character names lack imagination Stallone plays Henry ""Razor"" Sharp a mumbling steelworker with a heart of gold. De Niro is flamboyant steak house and used car dealership owner Billy ""The Kid"" McDonnen.The former boxing legends were to determine who ruled the ring 30 years previous a finale that was put on hold by one of them at the last minute. Enter annoying motormouth marketer Dante Slate Jr. (Kevin Hart) the son of the fighters original promoter. Slate comes up with a genius plan to exploit the boxers well-known rivalry by finally staging that deciding bout. Behold Grudgement Day; brought to you by Geritol. Really.McDonnen is the glib gadfly who loves to hold court at his bar while going on about his glory days while Sharp echoing Rocky Balboa with every mushmouth line is the lunch-bucket-toting working stiff who prefers to keep his past locked away. They hate each other for a variety of reasons but economics have convinced them -- especially the very reluctant Sharp -- to step into the ring again.Alan Arkin plays Sharps irascible trainer coaxed out of retirement to get his boy ready for battle again. When not complaining about his prostate or goading Slate he turns down his hearing aid and pretends deafness. His crabby shenanigans wear out quickly thanks to Tim Kellehers and Rodney Rothmans TV sitcom-like script which uses repetition as a way to fish for laughs.The arrival of Sharps ex-girlfriend (a facially immobile Kim Basinger) and The Walking Deads Jon Bernthal as the son McDonnen never knew he had give rise to the inevitable training montages that lead to the final showdown.Once in the ring the combatants dramatically toss off their robes to look like a pair of raw turkey necks in satin trunks. Stallone is the far fitter of the pair to be sure but gravity has come out swinging and its not pretty.Surprisingly director Peter Segal (Nutty Professor II The Klumps Get Smart) stages a final battle that for all its energetic and remarkably violent tone uses unexpected restraint in keeping the outcome under wraps. Theres little finesse elsewhere in the process however and much of the battle echoes earlier Rocky flicks right down to a massively swollen eye and the possibility Stallone will bellow ""Cut me""The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Tuesday Dec. 24 2013 1200AM EST Last updated Tuesday Dec. 24 2013 844AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Peter Segal Written by Tim Kelleher Starring Sylvester Stallone Robert De Niro Kim Basinger Alan Arkin Classification 14A Year 2013 Country USA Language English Could Mr. T beat Mr. Clean? Could Flipper beat Jaws? If youve ever wondered about the fighting talents of real and fictitious pop celebrities the vintage website Grudge-Match.com (1995-2005) which combined speculative analysis and Internet votes was a time-wasters haven but it was incomplete. Though the site offered Rocky vs. Rambo for some reason the more logical Rocky vs. Jake LaMotta missed the cut. Now we have a movie called Grudge Match to fill that yawning gap. Robert De Niro and Sylvester Stallone are two former boxers now in their 60s who want to reschedule a match that was cancelled 30 years before. For film buffs theres a brief montage to savour vintage clips of a young Stallone and De Niro practising boxing for their parts in Rocky and Raging Bull which underscore the parallels between Stallones blue-collar fairy tale in the first of those movies and De Niros ring opera in the second.A seniors comedy that riffs on the two actors most famous roles its more like Grumpy Old Men with Spit Buckets. Picking up from the late scenes of Raging Bull we see De Niro as Billy (The Kid) McDonnen onstage from his Pittsburgh bar insulting women and telling old boxing stories. His old rival played by Stallone is Henry (Razor) Sharp - their Italian-American names have been dropped - who needs money to help pay the medical bills of his old manager (Alan Arkin caustically snappy as per usual).When a motor-mouthed promoter (Kevin Hart) wants them to do some motion-capture posing for a video game the rivals meet again shove each other around and thanks to a viral video become celebrities again. Soon a rematch is in the works.Theres a woman of course. Kim Basinger Razors old flame who hurt him many years ago emerges from the past to fire Razors sense of romance and ambition. Though Basinger (a mere 60) looks great its an awkward performance Too often shes left waiting for Stallone to slur out his next line.At times the script seems uncertain whether this is a family film or an R-rated comedy. Billy discovers an estranged adult son (The Walking Deads Jon Bernthal) named B.J. which provides the opportunity for a numbing number of off-colour jokes including some involving a child. As the more animated of the two aging warriors De Niro waves his hands and shouts a lot and occasionally shoots invective worthy of Raging Bulls Jake.Everyone in the movie of course is anxious to see these comeback seniors beat each other up except perhaps the viewing audience. While Stallone (67) and De Niro (70) have done a commendable job keeping their waistlines in check the vision of the two actors shuffling about the ring in an awkwardly choreographed slapfest is not inspiring. Courageous no doubt but really not inspiring.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Grudge Match is an old-guy sports comedy with a classic rock radio soundtrack and a plot that reads like New Hollywood fan fiction. It traffics in the overtly familiar; Sylvester Stallone and Robert De Niros characters might not be named Rocky Balboa and Jake LaMotta but they are respectively a working-class Pennsylvanian whose elderly trainer never takes off his hat and a loudmouth who used his winnings to buy a bar and now bores evening audiences with boxing stories. Its audience comfort food a story in which a delinquent dad learns to connect with his grown-up son a former couple rekindles their romance late in life and two icons square off in the ring.Stallone and De Niro star as Henry ""Razor"" Sharp and Billy ""The Kid"" McDonnen longtime boxing rivals who are briefly thrown back into the national spotlight because of a YouTube video. Eager to cash in on their newfound viral fame Dante Slate Jr. (Kevin Hart) the son of the manager who swindled Razor out of his winnings signs the two up for a novelty rematch which he ludicrously dubs ""Grudgement Day."" Training montages aging jokes and attempts to make up for past misdeeds ensue.Its exactly as cliched as it sounds. Whats unexpected however is the sensitivity and sense of perspective that Grudge Match brings to much of this secondhand material. De Niros late-period comic roles are invariably curmudgeonly and high-strung but he plays The Kid as a self-aware buffoon who traded his dignity for a cheesy theme restaurant and a used car dealership. (Stallone on the other hand sticks to his usual principled sarcastic loner persona.) The portrayal of Billys relationship with B.J. (Jon Bernthal) the trainer son he never knew unexpectedly avoids the customary arc of having the two characters warm up to each other over time. Instead they like each other immediately which makes the relationship feel more real than it should and gives an emotional urgency to its inevitable conflicts. Significantly the movie never attempts to portray Grudgement Day as anything other than a publicity stunt. To The Kid and Razor the fight is meaningful (more because of their age than their rivalry) but to almost everyone else in Grudge Match its a joke; the few reporters who even bother to show up to its press conference ask mocking questions. This has the effect of foregrounding the emotional underpinnings of the match however hackneyed they may be. It all adds up to a pleasant albeit very minor surprise a movie that never quite rises above its cliches but which nonetheless tries to invest them with emotional credibility.

TWITTER Robert De Niro and Sylvester Stallone cash in a few legacy chips in a limp boxing comedy. On one of the posters currently advertising Grudge Match two humanoid shapes vaguely resembling Robert De Niro and Sylvester Stallone face off in a boxing ring. Four of their co-stars are Photoshopped into ringside seats with no attempt made to line up the actors sightlines with the action theyre supposed to be watching. Its a lousy poster but its makers lack of effort is a fair reflection of Peter Segals film -- a lazy attempt to milk a few dollars from memories of Rocky and Raging Bull before the moviegoers who made those films hits are too old to reach cinemas without assistance. In a world where 2006s Rocky Balboa can gross over 150 million Warner Bros. may find some takers for this proposition; but Grudges attempt to meld Rocky sincerity with overfamiliar Grumpy Old Men shtick (Grumpy scribe Mark Steven Johnson is a producer here) is unlikely to sit well with fans suggesting a theatrical life that sags long before the 12th round. The two stars play roles designed to recall the heroes of their earlier films. Stallones Henry ""Razor"" Sharp after retiring from boxing proved his salt-of-the-earth nature by finding work at a Pittsburgh steel mill spending what little money he had to keep trainer Lightning Conlon (Alan Arkin) in a comfortable retirement home. Billy ""The Kid"" McDonnen (De Niro) on the other hand is a self-promoting hustler who continues to milk his fame Jake LaMotta-style in a nightclub act while privately mourning the greatness he mightve achieved. The two men fought each other twice three decades ago each scoring one win. But Razor quit boxing on the eve of their tie-breaking third bout for reasons related to his failed relationship with Sally (Kim Basinger). PHOTOS Senior Superheroes 19 Action Stars Kicking Butt Past 50 Reluctantly agreeing to a plan by would-be promoter Dante Slate Jr. (Kevin Hart) to do some motion-capture for a video game in which his avatar would fight that of The Kid Razor is ambushed in the studio by his former rival and gets into a no-ref brawl. A cell-phone video of the melee spreads quickly online (cue jokes about oldsters who dont know from ""viral"" or ""YouTube"") generating interest in an in-the-flesh rematch. Having just lost his job at the mill Razor has little choice but to agree to the payday hes offered for a belated tiebreaking fight. Kid on the other hand greets the news by running into the street shouting ""Yes Yes Yes"" -- an outburst De Niro performs with such a lack of finesse one shudders to think how the actors 1980 self would respond to it. Soon were on familiar ground with old and (in Kids case anyway) flabby men struggling with the failures of their once-powerful bodies. If youre interested in seeing Rocky bend over for a proctologist youve come to the right place. Razors training scenes get a boost from Arkins familiar but likable crotchety-motivator routine while Kids path back to fighting trim is more cumbersome. Hes approached by a 30-year-old son hes never met who just so happens to be a buff personal trainer BJ (Jon Bernthal) offers not only impossibly effective ringside pointers but an opportunity for Kids paternal redemption via his young son (Camden Gray). PHOTOS 80s Action Stars Where Are They Now? That storyline whose up-and-down path requires Kid to make some pretty unbelievable child-care mistakes is the pictures dramatic low point but Razors tentative courtship of his long-lost gal Sally isnt much better. The movie only wakes up when Hart and/or Arkin are onscreen (preferably together) the former an on-the-make schemer whose pursuit of a hit fight rubs the latter the wrong way. Slates attempts to generate public interest in the fight offer a couple of laughs but quickly become predictable Old guys do something silly in public; smartphone-wielding observers put video of it online; more tickets are sold. By the time of the two men get in the ring together though one has to ask who in the real world wants to see these men in boxing trunks turning each others faces to pulp as the sweat and spittle flies. Earlier this year Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger played off their action-hero legacies in Escape Plan a guilty pleasure that knew how to be ludicrous without leaving viewers feeling cheated. Stallone shouldnt have tried the same trick twice in a year.

Photo Warner Bros. Pictures MOVIE REVIEW Grudge Match Bad grandpas. Running time 113 minutes. Rated PG-13 (profanity crude humor sexual references boxing violence). At the E-Walk the 34th Street the Kips Bay others. They should have called me for help with the title for the De Niro-Stallone boxing comedy ""Grudge Match."" ""Aging Bulls"" might be too obvious but how about ""Raging Prostate""? Given the incessant squabbling between the leads ""The Rocky Horror Bitching Show"" might have worked or maybe they should have kept it simple and called it ""MoobFellas."" What they cant call it is funny. ""Grudge Match"" is one of those high-concept projects that must have sounded good on paper if that paper were parchment. Even the audience at whom the movie is aimed -- the crowd for whom dinner and a movie means meeting up at 3 p.m. -- will be bored by the stale funk coming off every scene. Sample of wit on offer? ""Wanna hear a noise? Its gonna be you cryin."" Or ""I say women are more verbal than men and they go Huh. "" Sylvester Stallone and Robert De Niro are rival Pittsburgh pugilists who after each provided the others sole defeat in the ring 30 years ago never fought a third time because Kid (De Niro) slept with Razors (Stallone) girl Sally (Kim Basinger). Razor went back to work at the local factory; Kid became a professional jerk doing sad late-LaMotta comedy at his ""Knocked Out Restaurant and Dinner Theater."" Thats the first clue that the movies going to aim for a low-level meta feel with references to each actors famous boxing movie. After the two enemies butt heads while working on a video-game version of their rivalry (roughly the same idea sparked 2006s ""Rocky Balboa"") and agree to step into the ring one more time Stallone drinks a glass of raw eggs while saying ""Seems like a lot of cholesterol."" Hell also start to take a swing at a side of meat. His manager (Alan Arkin) stops him ""Were just here to buy a little dinner you dont have to punch everything."" Because naturally a meat locker full of 150-pound slabs is where youd go to pick up a meal for two. As we kill time waiting for what must be the first boxing match in which the jockstraps are sponsored by Depends the plot unfolds dismally. Sallys son (Jon Bernthal) from her one-nighter with Kid arrives to reconcile with his dad and serve as the old mans trainer. Meanwhile Sally explains to Razor that her infidelity was just a misunderstanding and off they go on long romantic walks together. Comedian Kevin Hart as the promoter pops in every few scenes to issue high-pitched screams seemingly channeling some combination of Chris Tucker and Eddie Murphy but hes about as funny as arthritis. Everyone around the two geezers provides advice that you wish Stallone and De Niros agents would give them like ""A great performer knows when its time to get off the stage Kid."" Yet each man repeatedly knocks down younger professionals undercutting the movies grumpy-old-men premise. Are we laughing at these guys Scotch-and-flapjacks diet (Kid) or hobby of twisting scrap metal into ugly knickknacks (Razor)? Or is the joke on us for not realizing that theyre just a few pull-ups away from the top fighting form they show in the ring at the end? The biggest failure is that both characters seem so phony that you cant possibly care who wins the big fight. All you can do is marvel at the brutalities visited on Stallones face before he even stepped in the ring His plastic surgeon must have been a true artist because his features look to have been rearranged by Picasso.

Conan Ice Cube and Kevin Hart Catch a Ride With a Total Stranger (Video) Alonso Duralde Picks 10 Worst Movies of the Year Watching these screen legends goofing on their own career highlights mightve been fun but this staggeringly inane comedy feels more like desecration than inside-joking Sylvester Stallone has built an entire late-stage career out of nostalgia from periodically dredging up Rocky and Rambo for random sequels to a decades-too-late team-up with Arnold Schwarzenegger in ""Escape Plan"" to crafting the entire ""Expendables"" franchise around the gag of ""I used to be an action star."" Robert De Niro meanwhile has chipped away at his reputation as one of this generations finest screen actors with films that spoof his on-screen image (""Analyze This"" ""The Family"") and ones that are just outright embarrassing (""Red Lights"" ""Righteous Kill"" and a list that goes on and on down to ""The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle""). It was perhaps inevitable then that these two would meet up in a boxing movie that would capitalize on the clash between an over-the-hill Rocky Balboa and an AARP-ready Jake LaMotta (the real-life boxer De Niro won an Oscar for portraying in ""Raging Bull""). Such a pairing isnt the worst idea for a screen comedy but the execution of ""Grudge Match"" turns out to be so utterly dismal that the movie feels like the final insult on whats left of both actors reputations. See video Grudge Match Trailer Rocky Star Sylvester Stallone Fights Raging Bulls Robert De Niro The premise is pretty much what youd expect In the early 1980s the boxing world was captivated by the rivalry between two Pittsburgh-based light-heavyweights Henry ""Razor"" Sharp (Stallone) and Billy ""The Kid"" McDonnen (De Niro). Both fighters were undefeated except for the one match each lost to the other; before they could have a tie-breaker however Razor left the fight game and went back to his factory job. Razor got screwed out of his money by fight promoter Dante Slate (Anthony Bean) but The Kid managed to parlay his winnings and his local fame into owning a bar and an auto dealership. His financial success however hasnt kept him from stewing over Razors refusal to fight him again to determine who was the better boxer. Cut to the present day when Dante Slate Jr. (Kevin Hart) approaches Razor about doing motion-capture for a video game company that wants to put out a Razor vs. The Kid simulation. At first Razors not interested but when the plant closes and his old manager Louis (Alan Arkin) needs to be moved into a pricier nursing home Razor takes the gig. See video SNL Sylvester Stallone and Robert De Niro Join John Goodman; Mandela Interpreter Returns The Kid shows up at the recording session and when a fight between the two retired boxers (both wearing those green tights with the ping pong balls glued on them) goes viral public demand leads them to agree to their long-delayed grudge match. Dredging up the past means the return of Sally (Kim Basinger) and her son B.J. (Jon Bernthal) both of whom have a complicated history with Razor and The Kid. So youve got a game cast and a story that pretty much writes itself (and that plays into the public perception of its actors) -- why then is ""Grudge Match"" so utterly stultifying until it picks up some steam with the big climactic fight sequence? Director Peter Segal (""Get Smart"" ""50 First Dates"") and scribes Tim Kelleher (""First Kid"") and Rodney Rothman (a former head writer for ""Late Night With David Letterman"") cant seem to craft believable situations or witty dialogue to save their lives. Even worse they fall back on a lazy mix of homophobia transphobia (per IMDB theres actually a credited character listed as ""Tranny Hooker"") and misogyny. When were introduced to Arkins character while he complains about getting sponge baths from a male nurse I could feel Burgess Meredith sighing with relief from the afterlife grateful to have been spared this rotten screenplay. Also read Robert De Niro Cannot Navigate a Revolving Door on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon (Video) Even with the youll pardon the expression dramatic heavyweights in the lead roles its Bernthal (also currently appearing in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"") who comes off as the movies most natural and compelling performer. De Niro mugs Stallone mumbles Basinger struggles to make facial expressions and even the usually reliable Arkin and Hart are saddled with jokes that arent remotely funny. Go watch ""Rocky"" and ""Raging Bull"" again. Because as they say at closed-casket funerals its better to remember them as they were. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Having finally sated 80s action buffs with an Arnold Schwarzenegger co-starring vehicle (this years better-than-it-had-to-be ""Escape Plan"") Sylvester Stallone returns to the well of fan fiction by teaming with his onetime iconic-onscreen-pugilist rival Robert De Niro in ""Grudge Match."" Essentially recasting ""Grumpy Old Men"" with the senescent specters of Rocky Balboa and Jake LaMotta the result is sporadically amusing with some chucklesome sight gags and crowdpleasing supporting turns from Alan Arkin and Kevin Hart yet its all so overcooked that it defeats its own purpose. This Warner Bros. release should land some punches though not a knockout blow in the Christmas B.O. frame. In his 2011 book ""Retromania"" British music critic Simon Reynolds lamented pops Internet Age obsession with nostalgia for the very recent past noting that in modern culture ""history must have a dustbin or else history will be a dustbin."" Hollywood is hardly a stranger to this dilemma frequently rummaging through its own creative dumpster for neverending sequels and remakes but the latter-day careers of Stallone and De Niro are special cases indeed with the two stars - 67 and 70 respectively - essaying a series of roles that are not only informed by but practically senseless without knowledge of their filmographies. This tendency toward lazily coasting on familiarity hits a pinnacle for both in ""Grudge Match"" where the meta-stunt casting is far funnier in theory than in execution. As a Jim Lampley-narrated mini-docu informs us at the outset Henry ""Razor"" Sharp (Stallone) and Billy ""the Kid"" McDonnen (De Niro) were once the fiercest rivals in boxing with McDonnen beating Sharp in a classic bout and Sharp taking the spoils against an out-of-shape McDonnen in the rematch. A third score-settling grudge match was scheduled to take place 30 years ago but Sharp abruptly retired from boxing shortly before the opening bell. Since then the soft-spoken Sharp has retreated into life as a foundry-floor factotum in the scrappier outskirts of Pittsburgh while the peacocking McDonnen has parlayed his waning fame into a chain of steakhouses and car dealerships. In need of money to keep his aging trainer (Arkin) in a nursing home Sharp agrees to throw some punches in a motion-capture suit for a videogame leading to a confrontation with the similarly green-suited McDonnen in the studio. A ludicrous brawl breaks out between the two and camera-phone footage of the punch-up goes viral. Sensing an opportunity fast-talking aspiring fight promoter Dante Slate Jr. (Hart) convinces the two paunchy punchers to finally reschedule their ""Grudgement Day"" bout a televised spectacle that falls somewhere between ""Celebrity Boxing"" and Ali vs. Inoki on the dignity scale. Ostentatious callbacks to ""Rocky"" and ""Raging Bull"" take the form of Stallone quaffing raw eggs and strolling through a meat locker while DeNiro performs a chintzy nightclub comedy act. MPAA concerns likely kiboshed a reprisal of ""Bulls"" fabled ""You fuck my wife?"" exchange though it wouldnt have taken much to shoehorn it in. As it turns out Sharps abrupt retirement was sparked by McDonnens dalliances with his then-girlfriend (Kim Basinger) who abruptly reappears on the scene three decades later precisely as McDonnens estranged son B.J. (Jon Bernthal) emerges to connect with his old man quickly becoming his trainer. The rest of the film (directed by Peter Segal from a script by Tim Kelleher and Rodney Rothman) ambles forward with a series of training montages interrupted by old-man-falls-down slapstick interrupted by sappy drama with hit-and-miss setpieces occasionally compensating for the pics dreary lack of narrative propulsion. Considering how much of ""Rocky V"" and ""Rocky Balboa"" focused on the inherent sadness of an aged fighter enduring yet more punishment ""Grudge Match"" is quite glib about the potentially fatal fight at its center while it rarely passes up an opportunity to slather on pathos elsewhere via a cherubic little kid (Camden Gray) and images of laid-off industrial workers. Compared with De Niros shticky role in this years ""The Family"" -- in which his Jersey mobster character actually attends a screening of ""Goodfellas"" -- the actor has a few moments of spark playing the more unsavory of the two leads while Stallone mostly muddles through. (Both men it must be said are in quite impressive shape by the films final reel.) Arkin and Hart strike the same ornery-old-cuss/loudmouthed-little-man notes theyve hit a dozen times before though theyre good enough for quick laughs and Harts end-credits attempt to stage yet another retirement-age grudge match proves the funniest moment in the whole endeavor. Technical contributions are largely workmanlike although the climactic battle is sloppily staged and there are several shots in which Stallones face seems to be lit from an entirely different source as the rest of the scene perhaps suggesting some rushed CG touch-ups in post.

Pictures)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY review 1/2 out of 4Stars Sylvester Stallone Robert De Niro Kim Basinger Alan ArkinRated PG-13; runtime 1 hour 53 minutes; opens nationwide WednesdayIts hard to screw up a sports film. Even the schmaltzy ones usually offer a David vs. Goliath finale to restore our faith in the little guy.But in Grudge Match (1/2 out of four; PG-13 opens nationwide Wednesday) we get two Goliaths slugging it out in a desultory boxing flick whose punches miss wildly as entertainment but manage to chip away at the iconic legends who return to the ring after decades away from the sweet science.What a battle royale this could have been. Match posits a simple tantalizing question Who would win in a fight Rocky or Raging Bull? The story -- combined with the willingness of Sylvester Stallone and Robert De Niro to don the gloves and square off -- should have made Match a sure-fire knockout. But even with three Oscar winners Grudge will leave you walking out of the theater like you watched a fixed fight.Directed by Peter Segal (50 First Dates Anger Management) Grudge begins with odd exposition an ESPN-styled report about how boxing legends Henry ""Razor"" Sharp (Stallone) and Billy ""The Kid"" McDonnen never settled their decades-old rivalry because Razor retired suddenly for a blue-collar life in Pittsburgh. Kid meanwhile has become a boozing womanizer who has used his local celebrity to buy a steakhouse and car dealership.SNEAK PEEK Its De Niro vs Stallone in Grudge MatchMORE Other famous Hollywood grudge matchesVIDEO Stars out for NY premiere of MatchREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersIt isnt long before fight promoter Dante Slate (Kevin Hart) comes up with an idea telegraphed to audiences in the first five minutes set up a final battle which Slate names Grudgematch.Wasting Oscar-caliber talent of our aging stars has become a cottage industry of late (see RED 2 Stand Up Guys Last Vegas) but Grudge may trump them all in its willingness to have our stars clown about to promote the big fight including wearing skin-tight body-capture outfits that leave nothing to the imagination. Watching them parachute into cars and clock young whippersnappers becomes as painful to watch as it must have been to film.The trouble is our stars polar-opposite views on aging. At 70 De Niro is more than willing to poke fun at his iconic characters including the Godfather and has rejuvenated his career with silly turns sprinkled with strong appearances in David O. Russell films such as Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle.Stallone meanwhile seems to view his masterful 1997 crime drama Cop Land as an anomaly because the 67-year-old refuses to alter his big-screen persona as a palooka with a heart of gold and fists of fury. Its telling that in a half-dozen Rocky films Stallone plays boxer not trainer even if he is AARP-qualified.And he looks downright miserable here as a fighter who struggles to win the heart of lost love Sally Rose (Kim Basinger) while tending to aging manager Louis ""Lightning"" Conlon (Alan Arkin) a role thats supposed to remind us of Burgess Merediths timeless boxing manager Mickey but only makes us miss him.Grudge could have saved itself with a rousing finale but the buildup is so tedious you just want the fight to end -- particularly when De Niro and Stallone enter the ring. They are legends who look great for their age. But theres no denying that age nor their odd appearance in whats supposed to be a legitimate bout.There are rare deft touches in Grudge such as Arkin cracking raw eggs into a glass like Rocky used to down for breakfast. And the offset footage of a young Stallone and De Niro training for their iconic boxing roles is priceless.Still with Grudges cast and premise even in a fall full of potent films this could have been a contender. 17 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1c3obQu",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/12/23/grudge-match-review/4172951/,200,grudgematch23,grudgematch,usatoday

(Ben Rothstein) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Monday December 23 2013 400 PM Title Grudge Match Film Info With Robert De Niro Sylvester Stallone. Aging bulls. Director Peter Segal (152). PG-13 Crude humor sports violence language. Area theaters. Peter Segals cynical comedy ""Grudge Match"" could have been a contender. The premise is delicious boxers Billy ""The Kid"" McDonnen (Robert De Niro) and Henry ""Razor"" Sharp (Sylvester Stallone) -- long since retired -- still hate each other so much that theyll come out of a 30-year dormancy to fight one last time in the squared circle. Better still is the casting De Niro of course won an Oscar for the greatest portrayal of a boxer ever his take on Jake LaMotta in ""Raging Bull."" And Stallone became a superstar thanks to creating ""Rocky"" -- both the iconic film and its unforgettable main character/lug. Now its three decades later and money-hungry promoters are throwing money at these heavy hitters to cash in on their past glories. Happy to grab a quick paycheck they agree. Im talking of course about the characters in ""Grudge Match."" But I could just as easily be referring to De Niro and Stallone. Robert De Niro and Kevin Hart in ""Grudge Match"" (Ben Rothstein) The last time their on-screen characters met their nicknames actually meant something. In 82 The Kid won their title bout and then instantly retired before the requisite rematch. This -- plus the fact that The Kid stole away his onetime love Sally (Kim Basinger) -- still drives Razor crazy. The Kid thinks a heavily-hyped match between two 65-year-olds is a terrible idea. But he sees a chance to help his bankrupt former trainer (Alan Arkin) so he agrees. A director who really wanted to honor these actors legendary roles rather than simply use them as a marketing hook might have found a way to make this concept palatable. Segal (""Get Smart"") is not that director. Lets give credit to the cast at least most whom are fully (if bafflingly) committed. Stallone a better actor than anyone believes brings a touching pride to the proceedings. Theres a sadness about The Kid that makes him the movies most interesting element. Sylvester Stallone and Alan Arkin amid the beef in ""Grudge Match"" (Patti Perret) De Niro is charged with keeping the energy up and his enthusiasm almost sells the paint-by-numbers plot embarrassing pratfalls and inane jokes about Geritol and man boobs. The ageless and gorgeous Basinger seems uncomfortable (who can blame her?) but Arkin and Kevin Hart as a fast-talking promoter roll with the punches. All of that could be forgiven if the finale -- the big fight to which every boxing movie in history builds -- was a blockbuster. Alas with its clunky choreography and slow-moving athletes this may be the saddest fight scene in cinematic history. The problem isnt that the guys are old or out of shape (in fact they are quite buff). Its that theres no value and no fun in seeing two still-vital talents exploiting their past for nothing more than the price of a purse.

He wants to grumble and glare his way through cheap horror films meander through comedies even stoop to ""The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle""? Hes earned that right. And now he wants to reprise one of his greatest characters for a quick paycheck? Hey Brando did it in ""The Freshman."" (On the other hand ""The Freshman"" was a good movie. And do you really want to be patterning the second half of your career after Brandos?) Nonetheless the 70-year-old actor is onscreen squeezing a few more dollars out of our ""Raging Bull"" memories in ""Grudge Match"" a wild bit of stunt casting that sends him as an elderly boxer back into the ring to battle long-time rival Sylvester Stallone 67. Its not pretty. In fact its downright scary when the two of them after an hour-and-a-half of insults finally drop the robes and get into the ring. Its like two old leather handbags come to life and slapping each other around in slow-motion. But both actors are game and De Niro is in a rare animated mood. And if you can accept the absurdity of the situation and enjoy some of the bright if unsurprising supporting performances -- cranky old Alan Arkin excitable Kevin Hart -- at least it all goes by pretty quickly. The story set in Pittsburgh (home of lots of tax incentives and way too many movies lately) imagines a Ali/Frazier-style war that ended inconclusively after two bouts when De Niro (Billy ""The Kid"" McDonnen) slept with the girlfriend of Stallone (Henry ""Razor"" Sharp) and Stallone quit the fight game to work in a foundry. But the foundry is shutting down and bills are coming due -- not only the kind that arrive every month in Razors mailbox but the lingering feeling the Kid has that things have been left unfinished. So set up another bout rent a venue -- and lets get ready to stumble The film makes some clumsy references to past films -- theres a joke about Razor training ""Rocky""-style by pounding slabs of beef and the Kid has a bar and a bad comedy act like Jake LaMotta -- none of which quite works. Better is Hart as the bouts fast-talking promoter or Arkin as Stallones cranky ex-trainer. Kim Basinger shows up too as the Woman Who Came Between Them. She looks lovely and also pretty miscast as the sort of gal who falls for punchdrunk pugilists. But then she was married to Alec Baldwin for nearly 10 years so who knows? Amusing as it is (and for older folks empowering) to see these guys still strutting around (each one gets a carefully scripted chance to drop some upstart with a quick punch) by the time we actually get into the ring its harder and harder to suspend disbelief or ignore the camera tricks and quick cutting everything depends on. Despite that -- and some skeevy sex jokes an overly cute kid and a cringe-worthy scene which combines both -- if youre a fan the film might make a time-wasting rental a few months from now. Or even -- if youre desperate to find something to do with a male relative over the holidays -- a low-expectations movie ticket. But its nothing beyond that. And although he has no debts to us perhaps its time De Niro really considered if he doesnt owe himself a little more. Ratings note The film contains strong language sexual situations and violence. Grudge Match (PG-13) Warner Bros. (113 min.) Directed by Peter Segal. With Sylvester Stallone Robert De Niro.
