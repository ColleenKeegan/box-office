"Something Blue Gross-Out American Wedding washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living >> Follow Style On Movies Something Blue Gross-Out American Wedding Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post staff writer Saturday August 2 2003 In a recently published book of James Thurbers letters he is quoted writing to a friend ""I hate to see humor replaced by vulgarity and cruelty but Im afraid thats what were in for."" Thank Heaven Thurber didnt live long enough to see the ""American Pie"" franchise. Whereas the original 1999 movie was admittedly a sweet-natured appealingly loose sex romp the sequel was a lame corrosive retread (which of course did even bigger business) and the third ""American Wedding"" which opened yesterday is even worse. Commencing with a scene in which sex-obsessed Jim (Jason Biggs) proposes to his sex-obsessed girlfriend Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) -- before which she helpfully crawls under the restaurant table to deliver a carnal hors doeuvre -- ""American Wedding"" proceeds to trot out the predictable panoply of sex-obsessed set pieces. True to form screenwriter Adam Herz from whose forehead the entire unfortunate series sprang has mined his already impoverished imagination for the most uninspired libidinal tableaux and scatological sight gags he could dream up tying them together with a narrative thinner than a G-string at Jims bachelor party. Thus viewers are treated to the sight of the hateful character Stifler (Seann William Scott doing an unattractive Jim Carrey impersonation) with his nether regions covered in cake icing and assuming a compromising position with the brides family dog; later said Stifler will stuff his face with the excreta of said dog. The rest can barely be mentioned let alone described in a family newspaper. Suffice it to say that Eugene Levy is still slumming as Jims ever-understanding dad and Fred Willard -- with whom Levy collaborates so brilliantly in the Christopher Guest movies -- delivers the movies most genuine moment of humor as Michelles Irish American dad giving his rehearsal dinner toast ""May we sit many happy shivas together."" Part of what made the first ""American Pie"" work so well was its female cast; none of them shows up here save for Hannigan who is joined by January Jones in an undistinguished turn as Michelles sister. The entire overlong affair has been less directed than extruded by Jesse Dylan who has all the visual flair and sense of pacing of a soda can-stamping machine. If life were fair ""American Wedding"" would have been called off long ago. Thurbers theory of human progress being what it is itll probably do even better at the box office than its predecessors thus forcing Hollywood -- and the rest of us -- to take it somewhat seriously as a cultural bellwether. After all 30 million teenagers cant be wrong can they? As 60 million parents will tell you Yes they can. American Wedding (110 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for sexual content language and crude humor.

"Wedding a Familiar Slice of Pie washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids Wedding a Familiar Slice of Pie Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday August 1 2003 SHOCK PREDICTION ""American Wedding"" wont win an Oscar for best original screenplay. But it knows the rules People want to laugh cringe with embarrassment and shake their heads in horrified disbelief at how far this thing dares to go. Producer-writer (and original creator) Adam Herz and director Jesse Dylan (whos also Bobs son and Wallflower Jakobs brother) oblige these expectations perfectly. If you do not bring pride good taste or sense to this third ""American Pie"" installment youll have a good time. Of course you wont admit it in front of respectable company -- who should know better than to ask anyway. In ""Wedding"" Jim Levinstein (Jason Biggs) intends to tie the knot with longtime girlfriend Michelle Flaherty (Alyson Hannigan). Of course this sets him up for huge trouble in so many ways. As Jim goes through the groom-to-bes rites of passage he screws things up at every turn. When trying to propose at a restaurant for instance he ends up with his trousers around his ankles with Michelle crouched under the table and several customers (including his dad) watching in horror. He still manages to ask for Michelles hand. More disaster awaits as Jim weathers an unexpected stag party attempts to impress Michelles parents (Fred Willard and Deborah Rush) and tries to keep Stifler away from the wedding. Ah Stifler. As played by the satyrlike Seann William Scott hes the joker in the pack whose mission is to destroy all sense of stability and peace. He leads Jim and the guys into a Chicago nightclub (only to discover its a gay spot) hits on Michelles sister Cadence (January Jones) and destroys the entire supply of flowers for the ceremony. Hes shameless sickening and disgusting and naturally I mean that in the nicest possible way. Jim has his usual uncomfortable conferences with dad (the always funny Eugene Levy) who tries to encourage his son with too much information. And Jims pals Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) and Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) are back too most memorably when they stage that stag party complete with busty semi-nude hookers unaware that Jim is about to enter the place with Michelles folks -- intending to have a sedate get-acquainted dinner. The movie which includes the requisite gross-out scenes (involving the wedding cake as well as a nasty doggy doo moment) and a tour-de-force dance contest between Stifler and a muscular gay performer is anti-serious liberated and often very funny. And as long as Jim gets himself into embarrassing scrapes which seems to be all the time (and as long as people keep paying to watch his torturous experiences) this ""American Pie"" series shows no sign of ending. After all there are so many more potential disasters for Jim to face in subsequent movies. How will Jim cope with a long-term marriage? What about first-time parenthood? How about the death of one of his parents? Or crazy teenage children? Or a midlife crisis? Or retirement? Ladies and gentlemen theres a million different ways to bake that pie and its up to you whether you take a slice or not.

This sounds like the right intellectual prep work for microwaving slice 3 of the American Pie series. But once again Dylan delivers a comedy just on the high side of exactly whats expected. Spotty and uneven Wedding shouldnt even have the embarrassed guffaws it has and it probably wouldnt were it not for a robust cast. But with so many high-priced sequels this summer proving tough to sit through its notable that one of this sorry packs lower-profile movies is among the very few with even a slice of entertainment value. Review of the movie American Wedding ( out of four) Stars Jason Biggs Alyson Hannigan Seann William Scott Eugene Levy January Jones Fred Willard Director Jesse Dylan Distributor Universal Rating R for sexual content language crude humor. Opens today nationwide Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) are getting married yet the movie belongs to the leer Seann William Scott employs as the no-doubt-intentionally-named Steve Stifler. Taking his motivational cue from director Dylans daddy Bob walking libido Steve lives only to ""lay lady lay."" Stifler has his eyes on the brides gorgeous sis (January Jones) but hes incapable of sincerity. When one scene shows a TV airing an old Leave It to Beaver episode were reminded that Stifler is a demented version of Eddie Haskell ripe for humiliation. This is why Weddings target audience probably will enjoy the scene in which hes forced to eat dog feces. Eugene Levy is back as Jims dad Jennifer Coolidge returns in a brief cameo as Stiflers mom and the great Fred Willard is the father of the bride. Theres also a gay bar scene and a couple of blonde Samp;M artists who may make your own granny prefer to stay home with Wally-Beav reruns. About all you can bring to a comic second sequel is energy and everyone here tries hard to put over material so negligible that it submerged the talent of Pie I director team Paul and Chris Weitz until they later surprised the world with About a Boy. The series probably has run its course but if sequels have to be made how about a combo? It would be fun to see whether Stifler could unfreeze or at least gross out Little Ms. Rigid Lara Croft.

Starring Jason Biggs Alyson Hannigan Seann William Scott and Eugene Levy. Directed by Jesse Dylan. (R. 102 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""American Wedding"" finds the ""American Pie"" franchise a full two films removed from its last breath of inspiration and flailing blue-in-the-face in the direction of anything that might reel in a laugh. Screenwriter Adam Herz goes back to his original ""American Pie"" script to find jokes instead of finding them in truthful observation or an amused take on life. The strain and desperation are apparent from the first scene. Two jokes hit home both involving Stifler (Seann William Scott) the former high school menace who is now as a young adult even more libidinous and irrational than before. In one scene he eats excrement; in another he unwittingly has carnal knowledge of a very old lady. These are big laughs so theres no point in being snobbish about them. But in a two-hour movie theyre not enough. Thirty or 40 laughs would be more like it. The emphasis on Stifler is symptomatic of whats wrong with ""American Wedding."" He was never the star of ""American Pie."" He was always the buffoonish nemesis the obnoxious high school success who gets his comeuppance. Here he steps into the comic vacuum created by Herzs misguided transformation of Jim (Jason Biggs) from hapless sex-crazed adolescent to sincere lover. This was the mistake of ""American Pie 2"" and Herz and the audience end up paying for it here. Jims girlfriend Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) has never been more than a one-joke character a seemingly demure girl whose oblivious manner belies a voracious sexual appetite. As the bride in ""American Wedding"" shes set up to be at the center of the film but theres nothing to be done with Michelle -- shes a punch line not a personality -- and so she must be shoved to the side. Jim whose sexual humiliations in the first ""American Pie"" were a delight to behold is also nudged toward the periphery. The funniest thing Biggs gets to do in ""American Wedding"" is worry over whether his in-laws (Fred Willard and Deborah Rush) like him. Thats pretty tame. So Stifler is elevated to prominence but he has always been a repellent character and in ""American Wedding"" hes become downright grotesque. Director Jesse Dylan (Bobs son by the way) either allows or (unfathomably) encourages Scott to play Stifler as a veritable freak a mugging twitching snarling gesticulating and obscenely gesturing lunatic. Watching him is a wearying experience and his comic villainy inspires intense audience antipathy -- thats why the biggest laughs are at his expense. Yet probably because Herz features Stifler so prominently he feels the need to soften up on him. In the end the movie tries to get us to like and root for a character it has made us loathe. This softening-up process is symptomatic of ""American Wedding"" as a whole. Its the old story After a few sequels every character becomes normal. Physics aside characters in motion dont tend to stay in motion. If not pushed inertia sets in. Chris Klein part of the original ""American Pie"" quartet is nowhere to be found in the third installment and his sitting this one out probably constitutes a good career move. Thomas Ian Nicholas as Kevin is reduced to a minor supporting player. Eugene Levy is back for the third time as Jims father whos an odd mix of squareness and tolerance. Levy inspires a few chuckles here and there but the opening bit -- once again Dad walks in while Jim is in a compromising sexual situation -- just shows how exhausted this franchise has become. Advisory This film contains gross harsh language sexual situations simulated sex and nudity.

""American Wedding"" reveals the ""Pie"" filmmaking team operating under the assumption that the franchises core crowd is growing up. This perfectly timed marketplace entry should translate into terrific returns. The purportedly final serving of ""American Pie"" is tastier than the previous two now sad-looking chapters. ""American Wedding"" not only shows Jason Biggs Jim growing up and getting hitched but reveals the ""Pie"" filmmaking team operating under the assumption that the franchises core crowd is growing up as well. Still gross-out fans may take heart because along with the changes come the nastiest -- and funniest -- stunts in the annals of the sub-genre or at least since early John Waters. This perfectly timed marketplace entry should translate into terrific returns and very possibly result in one of the summers bona fide sustainable hits. Several factors account for the franchises strong finish beginning with the naturally comedic itchy time between proposal and nuptials as well as ""Pie"" creator Adam Herz writing solo this time. With Jim and company out of college and entering the adult world there is less purely late-teen frivolity and more interaction with older folks. This means more room and time for vet comics notably the upgrade of the series interest in some of Christopher Guests core company (such as Eugene Levy and Jennifer Coolidge) including ample space for Fred Willard as the father of the bride. The icing is a surprising display of wonderful comic timing as well as farce sequences worthy of Francois Veber from young helmer Jesse Dylan (""How High""). Technically pic looks and sounds vastly better than its two older kin with a major contribution by ace lenser Lloyd Ahern. Starting with a solid premise -- after three years of sometimes crazy dating Jim (Biggs) decides to marry Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) -- Herz has constructed the script around five set pieces each one topping the last. The first before titles gets things going raucously with Jim popping the question in a fine restaurant as nympho Michelle does her beau under the table and Jims Dad (Levy) shows up at exactly the worst moment. Jim is a well-meaning guy drowning is his own worries and his initial one -- that he cant dance meaning that hell be a disaster at his own wedding -- is nothing compared to what emerges as his real problems. Those include first the impossibly buffoonish Stifler (Seann William Scott) barging in uninvited to the festivities and immediately plotting a wild bachelor party. And second theres Michelles conservative ultra-WASPy parents Harold and Mary Flaherty (Willard Deborah Rush) who first spot Jim in an extremely compromising position as hes struggling with Stifler and the Flahertys two dogs. ""As the future protector of my first-born youre off to a bad start"" opines Willard as only Willard can to Biggs. Even though its beyond a stretch Jim and his mates -- led by wise wily Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) -- spy on Michelle shopping for her wedding dress and venture to Chicago to recruit the dress designer. Its all an excuse for a witty high-energy sequence in a gay bar which the clueless Stifler unwittingly stumbles into and ends up in a goofy dance-off with beefy patron Bear (Eric Allen Kramer). ""American Wedding"" cannily finds several ways of having the young folks interact with their elders to maximum effect and some of this spins around Mary deciding to make up Jims mind for him on who will be his best man. At the same time Stifler sets eyes on Michelles lissome blonde younger -- and virginal -- sister Cadence (January Jones). Since Finch also has Cadence in his sights this triggers complex multicharacter power plays and mind games that the series has never remotely explored before. The whirlwind of relationships reaches a peak in the series funniest single set piece in which Stiflers planned bachelor party (complete with Bear and two ultra-sexy ladies) disastrously collides with Jims own planned quiet dinner with Harold and Mary. Its as if the usual ""American Pie"" formulas were taken over by master farceurs displaying a fierce and smart energy thats so often lacking in contempo American comedy. The funny stuff continues for a quite satisfying conclusion during the wedding prep and ceremonies which Stifler single-handedly transforms into his own personal gross-out comedy masterpiece. The ensemble of both returnees and newbies plays a well-balanced act between complete excess and droll underplay. Scott reps the former taking a while to get into gear but finally virtually stealing the movie. Biggs and Hannigan generally play the latter style with charm and the right note of pre-wedding queasiness. Levy Thomas and the ""Pie"" regulars seem even more confidently into their shtick than before. New entrants Willard Rush Jones and a crotchety Angela Paton as Jims grandma all leave a terrific impression with Willard reaffirming that he is in the top tier of movie funnymen. Production package has matured along with everything else with the extra sheen of design and visual elements not putting an unneeded polish on the de rigueur crudities.

"American Wedding | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; american-wedding ) American Wedding (United States 2003) A movie review by James Berardinelli The summer of bad sequels finally has an entry that can boast being noticeably better than its immediate predecessor American Wedding. The third entry into the American Pie series this movie is a vast improvement over the tired and uninspired American Pie 2 although it fails to make it to the lofty perch occupied by the first film. The recipe which probably doesnt need additional refining brings back some of the sweetness of the original American Pie and combines it with the expected ingredients of excessive raunchiness and vulgarity. Top it off with one of the most gut-churningly disgusting moments in any recent comedy and you have American Wedding. Comedy is subjective. In order to even begin to appreciate what director Jesse Dylan and writer Adam Herz (who penned all three American Pie scripts) have fashioned here you have to possess a high tolerance for the sophomoric no-holds-barred antics of a bunch of newly graduated (from college) reprobates. If you couldnt tolerate the first American Pie have difficulty with the Farrelly Brothers canon and would have preferred not to have taken a Road Trip then this movie isnt for you. But if you like films that try to make Animal House look like nursery school material plunk down your hard-earned 10 and have a good time. Parts of American Wedding are hilarious. Laugh-your-butt-off hilarious. Roll-in-the-aisles hilarious. But the whole isnt quite the sum of its parts. This is a series of loosely connected sketches that dont quite amount to an entire plot. When its funny American Wedding is very funny. When its gross American Wedding is very gross. When its cute American Wedding is very cute. But in between those moments theres not a lot going on. I felt about this movie the way I did about Old School. It succeeds at being exactly what it intends to be and that will likely cause orgasmic waves of pleasure to roll over the films target audience. Conservatives or morally upright people who stumble into this movie will need a valium. The premise is simple enough. Now that college is over our American Pie hero Jim (Jason Biggs) has decided that he wants to get serious about life. That involves asking his girlfriend Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) the ex-band camp babe to marry him. Once the unorthodox proposal is accepted Jim and Michelles friends and family gather together to plan the wedding. For Steve Stifler (Seann William Scott) the actual ceremony is only a sidelight to the central event the bachelor party. And when a quirk of fate makes his presence necessary to salvaging the brides perfect wedding vision Stifler not only takes charge obtaining the stag nights entertainment but starts romancing Michelles younger sister Cadence (January Jones). Normally dogs appear in movies to be saved from natural disasters. In this case however they nearly represent a natural disaster at least as far as Stifler is concerned. Imagine two of the most repugnant things that can happen with a dog outside of Freddy Got Fingered and you can guess what happens here. One of these scenes actually caused me to cringe and momentarily avert my eyes and Im not a squeamish person. Since this is obviously what director Jesse (son of Bob) Dylan intended he did a good job. As one might reasonably expect the bachelor party is American Weddings high (or should that be low?) point at least as far as generating laughs. Like any good piece of comedy it starts out slowly then builds to an uproarious climax. Without giving too much away it features two surgically-enhanced strippers (who in American Pie fashion show just about everything) a pair of uptight conservatives and a lot of chocolate sauce. (No dog this time.) For pure laughs the second-place finisher to the bachelor party is Stiflers dance-off in a gay bar. The actors are all familiar with their roles and handle them with the ease of people slipping into comfortable clothing. Jason Biggs Jim is as likeable as he is inept. Alyson Hannigans Michelle is all the more adorable because of her naughty side. These two click and represent one of 2003s most appealing screen couples. Eddie Kaye Thomas Paul and Thomas Ian Nicholas Kevin do exactly what they did in the other movies. Eugene Levy wearing his best dead-pan expression is on hand to once again dispense advice that is sometimes so graphic that his son would rather not hear. And in a role expanded to account for his soaring popularity Seann William Scotts Stifler is just as profane and boorish as ever (although the movie does try to soften him around the edges). Newcomers include a pretty-but-bland January Jones as Stiflers love interest and the inimitable Fred Willard (who despite being underused still has a great scene) as Michelles father. The first American Pie was funny fresh bawdy and profane. The second American Pie lost much of the humor and freshness while retaining the vulgarity. American Wedding actually elevates the level of coarseness but brings back the comedy. Theres more energy here than in American Pie 2 and more potential to offend than in any movie since Freddy Got Fingered. If you think youre going to like American Wedding you probably will. If you dont you probably wont. I guess the next time out well get to see how Jim and Michelle handle being parents. I can imagine what will happen to Stifler in that onea| American Wedding (United States 2003) Director Jesse Dylan Cast Jason Biggs Deborah Rush Molly Cheek Eugene Levy January Jones Thomas Ian Nicholas Eddie Kaye Thomas Alyson Hannigan Seann William Scott Fred Willard Screenplay Adam Herz Cinematography Lloyd Ahern II Music Christophe Beck U.S. Distributor Universal Pictures Run Time 138 U.S. Release Date 2003-08-01 MPAA Rating ""R"" (Profanity Sexual Content Nudity) Genre COMEDY Subtitles none Theatrical Aspect Ratio 2.351 Comments Add Comment Three...better movies of this genre Princess Bride The (1987) City Lights (1931) This Is Spinal Tap (1984) worse movies of this genre Feast (2006) Dumb and Dumberer (2003) Freddy Got Fingered (2001) Three...better movies of Jason Biggs American Pie (1999) Loser (2000) Prozac Nation (2003) worse movies of Jason Biggs My Best Friends Girl (2008) Over Her Dead Body (2008) American Pie 2 (2001) Three...better movies of Deborah Rush (There are no more better movies of Deborah Rush) worse movies of Deborah Rush (There are no more worst movies of Deborah Rush) Three...better movies of Molly Cheek (There are no more better movies of Molly Cheek) worse movies of Molly Cheek (There are no more worst movies of Molly Cheek) ReelViews Library Currently in Cinema Writings Fictional Writings ReelThoughts Specials About Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions Contact Website credits",http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=2447,200,americanwedding16,americanwedding,reelviews

Half the franchises core cast (including Mena Suvari Chris Klein and Tara Reid) chose to skip the big fat geek wedding of recent college grads Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle (Alyson Hannigan). You can hardly blame the no-shows considering that the inept direction of ""How High""s Jesse Dylan reduces American Wedding to a groin-numbing onslaught of sexual-humiliation and emission-ingestion gags. Among the rote drolleries Jims dad (Eugene Levy) catches his son with his pants down literally twice in the first 15 minutes; perennial horndog Steve Stifler (Seann William Scott) downs a doggy-doo truffle; and Jim accidentally garnishes the wedding cake with his pubic shavings. Even gifted Christopher Guest cronies Levy Jennifer Coolidge and Fred Willard cant make ""American Wedding""s comic wind any mightier.
