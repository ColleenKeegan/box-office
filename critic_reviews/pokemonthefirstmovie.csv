C- Pokemon The Movie 2000 Genre Sci-fi and Fantasy Animation; Starring Eric Stuart Veronica Taylor; Director Michael Haigney Kunihiko Yuyama; Runtime (in minutes) 80; MPAA Rating G; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted July 28 2000 -- 1200 AM EDT The grown men and women who market Pokemon The Movie 2000 are promoting six new soulless and jittery animated characters as an exciting advance on last falls lucrative mechanical Pokemon The First Movie. But -- minus a stake in Nintendo -- any grown men and women who pay to see the movie face a harrowing ordeal. I can think of three survival plans 1. They can drop mescaline for a spectacular psychedelic experience (illegal; no endorsement implied). This may prove most effective during the syrupy ""Pikachus Rescue Adventure"" that precedes the ponderous feature ""The Power of One."" 2. They can gnaw their own arms off while the children accompanying them bounce up and down shrieking Pikachu Squirtle Meowth oblivious to the phony hug-the-earth messages passing for moral value. (The Backstreet Boy-ish kid hero Ash learns ""In your hand rests the world and its fate."") 3. They can marvel uneasily at the fantastically weird Japanese-ness of this Game Boy-based phenomenon the mutant blending of the kitschy and the grimly symbolic. When Ash works in harmony with three powerful Pokemon birds to save his Nipponese home islands in ""The Power of One"" is he demonstrating Zen concentration? Is he the godhead in a Christian allegory? Do kids care? Balbasaur Zapdos Misty they scream in a din that drowns out all adult howls.

Pokemon The First Movie may turn out to be a hip prepubescent smash but what I saw was a dismayingly impersonal piece of anime genial yet chaotic with characters such as the pip-squeak runt Pikachu who can be described as either monsters or mascots but are really childrens twinkly abstract projections of themselves. With these sorts of buddies why would a youngster bother to look anywhere else? Like the cuddlier (and far more ingenious) Teletubbies the Pokemon menagerie -- 150 characters and counting -- are at once pre- and post-verbal occupying a winsome world of kitschy-koo narcissism. In the film Pikachu and Ash the Pokemon ""trainer"" (whatever that is) face down the evil clone Mewtwo a kind of loose-limbed Darth Vader of Pokemon. As toys the Pokemon crew are eminently collectible fun but as figures of fantasy they raise a question Will the kids who flock to this movie ever want to be entertained by something that doesnt walk or talk with the burbly synthetic coldness of a videogame? Its not an irrelevant issue; those kids are the teen boom of tomorrow.

Comments (1) Pokemon The First Movie A character I cant even begin to describe gains consciousness in a laboratory then becomes resentful when it realizes its a clone. It soon resolves to dominate not only the human scientists who created it but also the nonhuman species to which it belongs. Theres something intriguingly abstract about the premise of this animated action movie--combative role-playing games involving imaginary species that are both extensions and reflections of their human owners--and all the abstraction seems to offset the cloying cuteness of the nonhuman characters. The repetitive plot is essentially a string of excuses for fantastical combat sequences but somehow several characters insistence that violence is bad doesnt come off as hypocritical. By the time the fighting between clones and their originals turned to fraternal bonding I was quite moved even blissed out. Norman Grossfeld John Touhey and director Michael Haigney adapted this English version of a Japanese movie written by Takeshi Shudo and directed by Kunihiko Yuyama thats based on the TV show thats based on the game. 75 min.

Directed by Kunihiko Yuyama. (G. 89 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Did somebody shout ""Pikachu"" in a crowded movie theater? Whatever -- let the stampede start for ""Pokemon The First Movie."" Its certain to prompt a preteen jam-up of ticket lines and blockbuster box-office sales this weekend at every multiplex in the Bay Area. Opening today two days earlier than originally scheduled the big- screen version of the Pocket Monster phenomenon that wont quit rides into theaters on a wave of video games books comics trading cards and a super-hot kids television series courtesy of Warner Bros. Forget Toyota and Honda; Pokemon is Japans monster import these days. Does it matter what a critic says about the merits of ""Pokemon The First Movie""? Not a bit. But for the record it isnt terrible. Its far from a milestone in Japanese animation and not an especially memorable entertainment. Yet it doesnt try to be either of those things. As long as the rotund fuzzy Pikachu with windswept ears and lightning-bolt tail is onscreen with human trainer Ash Ketchum and pals Misty and Brock it hardly matters that ""Pokemon The First Movie"" is little more than a long TV-style cartoon episode that requires the purchase of a ticket. And a phenomenon like ""Pokemon"" guarantees theaters full of kids and their antsy energy along with sticky floors. That can be fun for adults too except those who cant stand kids. For anyone who has somehow missed the Pokemon thing it began in Japan a warp-speed three years ago when Nintendo introduced ""Pocket Monsters"" software for its popular Game Boy portable video game system. The game was created by software wizards Satoshi Tajiri and Tsunekazu Ishihara. Pokemon is an interactive role- playing game. Players called trainers keep a number of small creatures of various species on hand to fight one another. Its like dachshund owners letting their dogs out to engage in combat at the local park. The Pokemon are not quite robots. Each one -- and there are now 151 which parents have shelled out untold millions to buy for their kids -- has special powers and talents. Trainers try to gain status by skillfully knocking out other Pokemon. Thats part of the games appeal -- while violence is inherent nobody gets killed just knocked out and the little monsters do all the dirty work. ""Pokemon The First Movie"" released originally in Japan and dubbed in English for American audiences (theres even a reference to Minnesota) introduces a new Pokemon named Mewtwo. This major new character is a clone of the legendary Pokemon named Mew. Mewtwo looks like an oversized cross of cat squirrel and kangaroo with a potbelly from too many Pop Tarts. But Mewtwo is a villainous monster with attitude. For good reason. He was bioengineered by arrogant humans to be the strongest Pokemon ever. With Frankensteinian swagger the critter decides that its time for the Pokemon to break the bondage of their human trainers. Hes bent on proving his superiority over humans and other Pokemon and taking over the world. A big powerful pink bully thats Mewtwo. Ash Kristy and Brock are having a nice picnic near the seashore when they get the call to battle from a cute girl who appears as a hologram. They brave stormy seas (stirred up by Mewtwo) and reach distant New Island site of a Pokemon contest hosted by the ""worlds greatest Pokemon trainer"" (Mewtwo). Things look grim as Mewtwo shows his powers of destruction. But a human with heart comes to the rescue. ""Pokemon The First Movie"" is showing with a short titled ""Pikachus Vacation."" Although basically a mess it introduces Snubble a doglike Pokemon and Marrill a puffy water creature. Additional characters in the Pokemon movie are Cubone Raichu Psyduck Togepy and Squirtle. These are all household names anywhere kids between ages 3 and 11 reside. You may well ask whats the world coming to? ..

Young novelists and reporters will probably be using terms like Charizard-like or Squirtle-like in their work and insisting to their much older editors that everyone knows what they mean everyone who ate and slept Pokemon as a child anyway which will be the vast majority of young adults. But for now parents dont have to know the names and attributes of all 151 monsters to understand Pokemon The First Movie. In fact they dont have to know much of anything. This energetic 90-minute film is however an opportunity to observe many of the pocket monsters (thats what Pokemon is short for) in action. Charizard is a flying fire-breathing dragon type who in the film gets his head stuck in a pipe. Psyduck who resembles a duckbilled platypus looks entertainingly silly and one adult fan reports has powers only when he has a headache. Theres a monster called Togepy but adults may prefer to think of it as Starfish Eggshell Baby which more accurately describes its anatomy. Theres one called Marill who looks like a blue mouse with a big white underbelly. Theres one whose name I didnt catch that weeps projectile tears. And of course theres Pikachu the cutest of them all a bright yellow glistening-brown-eyed cross between a Muppet (maybe Elmos perpetually smiling cousin from Tokyo) Winnie-the-Pooh and a bunny rabbit wearing rouge. But when things get nasty Pikachu shoots electricity from his tail. This dual personality element has got to be a big part of the Pokemon appeal to children. Yeah I may look adorable and innocent the child-monster seems to say but dont make me mad. Sadly the magic doesnt bridge the generation gap. Whatever else has made Pokemon a Japanese cartoon series dubbed in English and all its attendant merchandising the biggest childrens pop-culture phenomenon in ages is still a secret of the grammar school set. But the animation with its rich colors and stylized angles is fun to watch and at times does seem like a psychedelic Sesame Street. The films plot is a simple variation of Frankenstein with James Bond accents. In an isolated laboratory on New Island evil scientists have bioengineered a new version of the rarest of all Pokemon Mew (which appears to be a flying cat with no mouth). What they get is Mewtwo the most powerful Pokemon of all about 10 times the size of the original and 50 times as mean. Mewtwo is angry with its creators for bringing it into the world with no purpose so it crashes through a lot of glass and sets fire to the lab and chases the humans away. Then it lures the best young Pokemon trainers and their Pokemon to the island for a mean-spirited showdown of clones versus originals. (Mewtwo being a fast learner has cloned all the visiting Pokemon.) As children well know nobody actually dies in Pokemon world; a battle is won when one monster knocks the other unconscious. One of the young Pokemon trainers involved is of course Ash the 12-year-old hero of the Pokemon television series on the WB network. He and his friends Misty and Brock turn up on New Island with Pikachu and others. Ashs Rocket team of archenemies consisting of a red-haired girl named Jessie a purple-haired boy named James and a Pokemon named Meowth who talks a lot like Top Cat (in fact hes the only Pokemon who can talk Im told) -- are not far behind. From then on the Pokemon do battle and characters spout pacifist profundities. A Pokemons real strength comes from the heart says one. This just proves that fighting is wrong says another. Someones got to take a stand. Someones got to say no and refuse to fight. As these words of wisdom are spoken pairs of monsters large and small continue to punch each other silly. A lot has been written about the admirable lessons that Pokemon teaches children about responsibility teamwork and obedience. But some unfortunate messages are being sent as well. Take the scene in which the harbor master tells all the young trainers that the boat to New Island has been canceled because theres a terrible storm at sea and its not safe. A select few of the children head into the storm anyway and make it to the island where they are praised as the only true young masters. Back at the harbor the woman in charge is admiring too. They follow their hearts she tells an employee. Thats what sets them apart. To them its just another challenge. Yes challenges are always character-building but this Pokemon scene endorses a reckless prove-yourself attitude the kind that leads inexperienced young pilots for instance to fly at night in low visibility. Parents may want to point that out.

Though Pokemania has settled into early middle age the second feature-length installment ""Pokemon 2000 the Movie The Power of One"" is a much more intense action vehicle for hero Ash Ketchum and his band of pocket monster trainers than its leaden sometimes claustrophobic predecessor. Returning to ongoing sagas roots in the great outdoors the new entry (which opened in Japan in the summer of 99 under the endless translated title ""Pocket Monsters the Movie The Phantom Pokemon Lugias Explosive Birth"") takes place on stormy seas in turbulent skies and on rocky volcanic islands. Combo of themes dealing with individual initiative courage and restoring the Earths ecological balance will play well with Poke-fans and their approving parents who will join to help this piece of the ongoing franchise put up good mid-range B.O. numbers and an extended ancillary life. Makers have clearly determined that the features unlike the lighter funkier tube item must be aimed at young boys and their yen for action-adventure. Ashs gal-pal and fellow trainer Misty is relegated to the sidelines here a fairly passive audience for Ashs grand exploits. Her biggest scenes which will go over heads of little ones involve modest cat fighting with a new female character the cynical-turned-believing Melody who seems to want to vie for Ashs attention. This goes nowhere though when the real action takes over. It tends to leave ""Pokemon"" girl fans without a true rooting interest of their own which isnt the case in the TV version. Whether this dampens broader enthusiasm for new pic is anyones guess but the Ash-leaning scenario is -- if anything in this cash-cow enterprise could be -- a calculated gamble. As per previous pic ""Pokemon 2000"" assumes aud knowledge of this universe created by Satoshi Tajiri but ironically contains a built-in critique of the collectors craze that defines the pop phenomenon for many. It comes in the form of Lawrence III yet another summer-screen British baddie who flies around in a massive machine resembling the ""Close Encounters"" mothership (created in 3-D animation a visual nuance new to ""Pokemon"" projects). His goal is to be the ultimate Pokemon collector capturing the three key Poke-birds which rule the elements of fire (Moltres) lightning (Zapdos) and ice (Articuno) . Capturing this trio Lawrence can also lure the powerful amphibious sea-air creature Lugia which controls deep sea currents and thus global weather. Perhaps only in ""Pokemon"" could a moral be drawn between excessive collecting and global weather imbalance but thats the dilemma Ash and his vacationing buddies fall into when Lawrences chicanery unleashes storms sending their boats adrift to Shamouti Island. Revelers (Melody among them) clad in Hopi-like costumes are holding a festival honoring the three elemental island birds and Ash is told that he could help restore the climates balance by finding three ""treasures"" (small potent glass balls) on the archipelago and placing them inside a holy stone circle on an island ruled by the tiny lonely pocket monster Slowking. Ash cant resist the mission impossible but the weather wont cooperate shipwrecking him and Melody and Mistys rescue boat. Plot becomes unnecessarily muddied with similar mishaps making the overall continuous sequence of action much less smooth than it should be and sometimes utterly confusing. Lawrences capture of the Pokemon trainers (including of course Ashs ever-joking arch-nemeses Jesse James and Meowth) along with rapid escape of the three captured birds leads to scenes of undistinguished animated action marked only by interesting views of Lawrences damaged airship as well as oceanic vistas of the birds warring with each other. Why they do this along with a number of other matters is something not even the worlds leading Poke-experts might be able to explain. Result is mucho action without a lot of sense behind it but animators impulse to go for trippy air water and ice imagery makes up for the question marks. New creatures added to the Pokemon stable are Lugia and Slowking one changeable and majestic the other static and slightly goofy but not quite up to the cool scale of previous features nasty Mewtwo. It reflects difference in tone here from first pic -- thankfully lighter visually easier on the eye and more suited to the ultra-flat anime style. The 3-D touches are a surprise perhaps a sign that makers feel need to keep up with some animation standards of other big-time entries. Animators face same feature-length problems as before which is keeping up with thick overactive plot. All signs thus point to clear fact that ""Pokemon"" storytelling is best suited to half-hour time slots. Fans will be happy that the English-language voice casting hasnt strayed much from original vocal thesps who all go for a sincerely serious tone that can be amusing if you take it in the right light. Soundtrack contains vanilla pop tunes and sub-par scoring with an early track saying it all -- ""We All Live in a Pokemon World."" Some Poke-purists will prefer short ""Pikachus Rescue Adventure"" which (like with earlier feature) runs before main attraction and has the kind of wild free-form animation of Pokemons running amok that started this whole craze in the first place.

C- Pokemon The Movie 2000 Genre Sci-fi and Fantasy Animation; Starring Eric Stuart Veronica Taylor; Director Michael Haigney Kunihiko Yuyama; Runtime (in minutes) 80; MPAA Rating G; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted July 28 2000 -- 1200 AM EDT The grown men and women who market Pokemon The Movie 2000 are promoting six new soulless and jittery animated characters as an exciting advance on last falls lucrative mechanical Pokemon The First Movie. But -- minus a stake in Nintendo -- any grown men and women who pay to see the movie face a harrowing ordeal. I can think of three survival plans 1. They can drop mescaline for a spectacular psychedelic experience (illegal; no endorsement implied). This may prove most effective during the syrupy ""Pikachus Rescue Adventure"" that precedes the ponderous feature ""The Power of One."" 2. They can gnaw their own arms off while the children accompanying them bounce up and down shrieking Pikachu Squirtle Meowth oblivious to the phony hug-the-earth messages passing for moral value. (The Backstreet Boy-ish kid hero Ash learns ""In your hand rests the world and its fate."") 3. They can marvel uneasily at the fantastically weird Japanese-ness of this Game Boy-based phenomenon the mutant blending of the kitschy and the grimly symbolic. When Ash works in harmony with three powerful Pokemon birds to save his Nipponese home islands in ""The Power of One"" is he demonstrating Zen concentration?
