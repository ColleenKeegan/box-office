Its just shiny. The Brothers Grimm is neither supernature here is less stardust and glitter than mud bark and fur with attitude while the story that this robust woodland sorcery is pegged to is far from enchanting. Ehren Krugers script presents diligent story-gatherers Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm as the Ghostbusters of German Romanticism charlatan exorcists forced into heroism when they arrive in a Black Forest village struggling against both Napoleonic oppression and the disappearance of young girls under familiar storybook circumstances. Knowing revamps of fairytale lore are nothing new for Terry Gilliam (see his Monty Python animations Time Bandits and Baron Munchausen) but the references here serve only as backdrop to a baggy uncertain narrative that has none of the cruel logic or retributive bite of its sources. As worldly horny Will and moony scholarly Jake respectively Matt Damon and Heath Ledger bring emotional plausibility to the fraternal relationship with its embedded jokes and frustrations but offer little to root for. Feisty local girl Lena Headey is equally bland while Jonathan Pryce and Peter Stormares Napoleonic villains soon irk. The child-snatchings do provide the basis for some strikingly nightmarish visual coups one is gobbled up by a spider-web-mouthed horse which then gallops full-bellied through the woods; another is literally defaced then engulfed by a doughy mud-sprite with a cheeky grin. There are also intriguing nods at deeper concerns contrasting the forest - a primal force impervious to rationality - against the obscenely self-justifying follies of imperialist occupation. Not enough however to add up to a happy ending.

"Gold Into Dross washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Gold Into Dross Monica Bellucci as Queen Mirror Director Terry Gilliam paid so much attention to his movies look that he seems to have had no time for that nuisance called plot. (Dimension Films Via Reuters) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday August 26 2005 Bruno Bettelheim titled his famous study of fairy tales ""The Uses of Enchantment."" Given what they do to the form the makers of ""The Brothers Grimm"" should have called theirs ""The Abuses of Enchantment."" The director is ex-Monty Pythoner Terry Gilliam whose films typically (and ""The Brothers Grimm"" is nothing if not typical) are jammed with stuff and all but empty of drama. That was true of his best film ""Brazil"" and his most successful film ""Time Bandits"" and most of his mediocrities such as ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"" ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" and ""Twelve Monkeys."" ""The Fisher King""? Dont get me started. His frame is very busy Every nook and cranny is filled; everything is studiously characterized the whole thing thrumming with life. Its as if theres been a coup on the set The art director has replaced the director. Yes it looks terrific yet it remains essentially inert. You keep waiting for something to happen and after a while your mind wanders from the hollow frenzy up there with all its filigrees and fretwork. That wrongheaded approach seems particularly misplaced in a work that means to celebrate two of the founders of the Western literary tradition the German brothers Jakob (1785-1863) and Wilhelm (1786-1859) Grimm. The brothers though you wouldnt learn it here spent much of the early part of their lives writing down the folk tales and legends of rural Germany thus providing the world with one of its most enduring treasures that sturdy form of narrative that begins most humans enchantments with the very idea of story the fairy tale. Their motive however was profoundly nationalistic They were doing the spadework for Otto von Bismarck finding and identifying a common culture for all the duchies and principalities and Graustarkias and Ruritanias that preceded the unification of the 1870s. Gilliam could care less about all that. Instead his spin is caustically modern; the plot it uses as armature wasnt borrowed from the Grimm boys at all or from German history or from dark musings on that plasma-red cesspool that was European politics for a thousand years but from a somewhat more spurious source of modern mythology ""Ghostbusters."" Like the Murray crew of jovial cynics the Grimms are first seen as charlatans who travel about the countryside to sites where semi-hysterical supernaturalism grips the peasantry. There they leverage the peasants out of a few kopeks or rubles or pfennigs (or whatever) by performing fraudulent exorcisms assisted by a secret crew of stage technicians who plant spooky thingamajigs that the boys (Will is played by Matt Damon Jake by a barely conscious hardly recognizable Heath Ledger) theatrically banish. Its a nice ruse until a village in the Black Forest actually begins to suffer disturbing supernatural events. The villagers send for the Grimms? No that would make too much sense. Instead Gilliam and his writer Ehren Kruger add a whole extraneous other level of bureaucracy to the film that helps to accomplish nothing except to make the story murkier still and bury the motives more deeply. He capitalizes on the fact that in the year of the film roughly 1813 the French had occupied Germany (Napoleon had not yet met his Waterloo at er Waterloo) and so its a French general (old Gilliam hand Jonathan Pryce star of ""Brazil"") and his Italian factotum (Peter Stormare; remember how good he was in ""Fargo"" when he kept his yap shut?) who are the prime movers. In practical terms it gives Pryce a chance to show off an impenetrable French accent and Stormare to show off an even more impenetrable Italian one. In story terms it makes Jake and Will modernist characters Theyre reluctant heroes dragooned into dangerous service against their wills who nevertheless find a way to triumph. But such a concept of antiheroic heroism didnt exist early in the 19th century They would have been branded cowards and quickly executed. It soon turns out that the village -- or at least the very dark woods outside it -- is indeed haunted by a particularly cruel demon who has begun disappearing girl-children for nefarious purposes. But the boys have no moral reaction to that; they simply being characters out of time formed by modernist conceits like existentialism want to survive and profit. They are required to be heroic. Again what purpose does this serve except to slow the movie down clot it with extraneous spoutings and mutterings ? The conceit that follows is extremely poorly thought out again putting on display the non-linear Gilliams substandard grip of narrative principles. Its not that the Grimms encounter their own famous stories in prototype and that we see the beginning of an opus and a tradition. No again that would make too much sense. What they encounter are fragments symbols icons loose change even from the work but not coherently unified into a single vision of the supernatural. It all adds up to an artificial fairy-tale situation that has no place in myth no antecedent in psychology not much meaning and even less resonance. We see the red hood of the little girl pursued by wolves; but then that blows away and we never see it again. We see Gretel separated from Hansel the birds having devoured her trail of crumbs taken mysteriously; we see the tower from which Rapunzel hung her hair or in which Sleeping Beauty slept but we dont see either Rapunzel or Sleeping Beauty. In short someone didnt do his homework; the original stories havent been cobbled together into a meaningful pattern and their odd and random fragments have no emotional weight. They also have no psychological weight. Bettelheim believed that fairy tales were Freudian myths and that they reflected anxieties of the child as he struggled to comprehend a baffling world; they were then therapeutic pedagogical and necessary. Gilliam only dimly understands this (Neil Jordans ""Company of Wolves"" of which this film may remind some viewers was much better at plumbing the hidden erotic meanings of a particular story). Gilliams take is fraudian not Freudian. And finally and quite simply its wrong. Gilliam and Kruger appear to have no idea who the Grimms were or what they did. They werent writers making stuff up their imaginations stimulated by certain images as this movie seems to think. They were folklorists who traveled about collecting stories from the oral tradition that had been handed down generation to generation over the millennia. That was their genius that was their labor that was their contribution. The ur-story here that Will and Jake ultimately encounter is a meltdown of tales into a kind of alphabet soup or a mother of all fairy tales but its really not very good not nearly as lasting or resonant as the real thing Its something about a sleeping beauty (a queen though not a princess) who demands of the mirror on the wall that she be the fairest of them all except of course she looks like a corpse on a particularly bad day. The mirror then shows her Monica Bellucci and who wouldnt prefer to look like Monica Bellucci rather than a corpse? It seems shes got some conspiracy going with a huntsman (the hero of ""Little Red Riding Hood"" remember here converted into an all-purpose villain and werewolf) which involves absconding with village virgins to restore her outside-the-mirror beauty. Agh Its completely arbitrary; it has no precedent or antecedent in the classical canon. It would have been much better if Gilliam and Kruger or whoever was making the decisions (rumors persist that Miramax/Dimension honchos Harvey and Bob Weinstein had an undue influence on the production) had selected not images from a batch of stories but the dramatic structure of one or two of the more famous ones; thats why theyve lasted thats why theyre famous. Its not an accident that a thousand years after its creation children are still thrilling to ""Sleeping Beauty"" or ""Little Red Riding Hood"" or ""Hansel and Gretel."" Into this miasma bumble the two German boys under French and Italian stewardship and accompanied for some reason by the wondrous British actress Lena Headey (great in ""Aberdeen"" a few years back) doing her own kind of wolf-girl impersonation. It feels as if too much attention by far was paid to the overall physical production and not nearly enough to the tensions and the structure of the story. Then there are the performances or rather then there arent the performances. Ledgers is awful; he hardly registers. He should have been replaced by someone who did. Damon does a game impersonation of a British schoolboy as an early-19th-century German folklorist and proves that even at the advanced age of 34 hed have made a pretty good Harry Potter. Unfortunately no one seems to have told him that his movie wasnt ""Harry Potter and the Python of Monty."" Headey isnt given enough to do Belluccis contribution is far more an appearance than a performance; no one else makes much of an impression. Gilliam does two things well mud and trees. We have a sense of a monochrome world built upon a slick insubstantial gloppy skin of gooey slipperiness. Someone get this guy a movie set in the mud bath of all times World War I; hed be a natural. The trees the rocks the stones of his natural world are again the most expressive things in this world. They have a personality and a level of menace his story and performers never begin to achieve. The Brothers Grimm (110 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for innuendo of violence to children and mild fighting sequences.

Color photography thats supposed to evoke fairy-tale mysticism that looks closer to muddy brown. Matt Damon in late-18th-century costuming. If there were a movie genre called ""the non-starter"" it sounds as if The Brothers Grimm could be a leader of the pack. Bewitching Jacob Grimm (Heath Ledger) is easily charmed by the wicked Queen Mirror (Monica Bellucci). Dimension Film But the director is Terry Gilliam who on paper seems the perfect person to portray Grimm grotesqueries. And as it turns out the best thing to be said about this expensive but drab wannabe mirthmaker is that it has some of its directors quirky touches. This at least sustains goodwill here and there amid storytelling that frequently sputters. The movie portrays Grimms Wilhelm (Damon) and Jacob (Heath Ledger) as traveling con men who are milking what they can in backwoods Germany. That is before they butt heads with one of Napoleons snobbiest an occupying French general played by Jonathan Pryce (star of Gilliams unforgettable Brazil). This automatically portends an eccentric and commercially daring spin on the siblings saga something opposite in tone from the solidly kiddie-oriented The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm a just-as-lumbering spectacle from 1962. About the movie The Brothers Grimm   (out of four) Stars Matt Damon Heath Ledger Lena Headey Jonathan Pryce Monica Bellucci Director Terry Gilliam Distributor Dimension Running time 1 hour 58 minutes Rated PG-13 for violence frightening sequences and brief suggestive material Opens Friday nationwide The con involves protecting villages from witches and Pryce decides to call the brothers bluff. Someone possibly a sorcerer has whisked away the local children into an enchanted forest. But as is often the case grisly inhabiting creatures arent that enchanting. If the brothers can solve the mystery and return the kids they can survive a fate worse than some of the food Pryce gets served in one of the films funnier throwaway bits. Ledger has more experience in period pictures which may be why his heart seems slightly more in his acting assignment. Still neither lead comes off as glib enough to seem comfortable with a con. In fact for a movie set up to deal with brothers this is a show the women steal. Lena Headey plays the one character who makes an emotional connection the Grimms contentious but attractive forest guide (even without makeup and in dress-down garb). And as an evil queen Monica Bellucci is an apt flesh-and-blood equivalent of all those Ms. Evils were used to seeing in vintage Disney animation. Brothers never catches fire the way Gilliams The Adventures of Baron Munchausen did. And you almost feel during subpar special effects that sweaty stagehands are pushing the trees around. As with last weeks animated Valiant this isnt a movie to invite contempt; you can always see what it wants to do and where it wants to go. But both seem passe which wouldnt be altogether fatal if they were made with a bigger grin or even a zestier wink.

Starring Matt Damon Heath Ledger and Monica Bellucci. Directed by Terry Gilliam. (PG-13. 119 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Terry Gilliams ""The Brothers Grimm"" is a whole lot of maggots English accents and frenzied energy a virtual nonstop bombardment of little woods creatures and special effects with an enchanted forest walking trees and a menacing blob that turns into the Gingerbread Man. Its a busy movie but its busy-ness has little to with story and character and everything to do with an exuberant impulse to throw stuff on a screen. Thus its energy is impressive but its effects are scattered. For sure the energy expended on screen stays there and is in no way passed on to the audience. In fact ""The Brothers Grimm"" -- with all its over-the-top performances flashy Gothic action and computer-generated creatures -- becomes boring. Its the cinematic equivalent of an all-dessert meal After the initial jolt the lack of any real nourishment is apparent and it becomes a struggle to stay awake. From a third of the way in through to the finish the film is a frisky but unremitting slog. This fanciful telling of the Grimm Brothers story presents Will (Matt Damon) and Jake (Heath Ledger)in their pre-storytelling days. Theyre a pair of charlatans working their con through Germany in the late 18th century. They arrive convince entire towns that the people there are under demonic attack and then set up fake exorcisms for which theyre handsomely paid. Such thievery gets them into trouble with the French authorities namely General Delatombe (Jonathan Pryce) the military man in charge of the French occupation (this is the Napoleonic era) and his right-hand man the torturer Cavaldi (Peter Stormare). Its symptomatic of the out-of-control tone and tiresome nature of ""The Brothers Grimm"" that Pryce seems to have been directed to make his French accent sound as phony as possible and Stormare was set loose to be incredibly annoying -- flouncing and preening snarling and declaiming at every opportunity. It actually hurts to watch him. Instead of being executed by the authorities the Grimms are freed on the condition that they can uncover the reason why children are disappearing from a small village. The townspeople responding to a strange rumbling in the woods believe something supernatural is behind the disappearances and the generals idea is that the Grimms being fakers will be able to expose the fakers who are terrorizing the people. But -- and this is where the main story kicks in -- the Grimms soon start suspecting that they might for the first time be up against something real. The movie attempts to make a meaningful contrast between Jake a believer and a romantic and Will a pragmatic skeptic. Yet despite an appealing actor in each role both characters come across as repellent. Will is a know-it-all with a mean streak and Jake is too earnest and nervous to engage our sympathy. Theyre neither flashy crooks nor charismatic heroes. Theyre just two guys in the woods surrounded by computerized animals putting audiences to sleep all over America. ""The Brothers Grimm"" swings from whimsy to adventure with each swing into whimsy defeating all sense of excitement or danger. Its partly a send-up and partly a sincere attempt at an adult fairy tale but mainly its erratic whatever Gilliam decided to try on any given day. As a capable pathfinder whose sisters have disappeared into the forest Lena Headey manages not to succumb to the frenetic energy surrounding her -- and escapes with her dignity. Monica Bellucci as a beautiful princess is convincingly beautiful and princess-like but the knowledge that the character she plays is actually 500 years old takes some of the edge off her allure. -- Advisory This film contains gun violence and frightening sequences.

Thus we have ""The Brothers Grimm"" a loopy fantasy of 19th-century superstitions that cost 80 million in fancy scenery and computerized graphics. From fairy tales to fiber optics Gilliam weaves more of his disjointed fun. It almost works. And its worth watching even when it doesnt since Gilliam this time employed adventurous and likable actors Matt Damon and Heath Ledger to carry the film. Ledger glides from furious avenger in ""The Patriot"" to bong-fueled skateboard prince in ""Lords of Dogtown."" Damon skips easily from action hero in ""The Bourne Identity"" to carefree conjoined twin in ""Stuck on You."" The actors rightly see working with Gilliam as a romp through the forest however dark and medieval and their Brothers Grimm are siblings with whom wed happily hoist a tankard. The premise of Ehren Krugers story was to make the brothers famous writers of often-grisly fairy tales in early 19th-century Europe a sort of ""Ghostbusters"" for the horse age. Jake and Will Grimm are scam artists who secretly create spectres with elaborate devices and tricks then triumphantly enter the village to rid the demons - for ample pay. Will (Damon) just wants to have a good time and bed the prettiest milk maids while Jake (Ledger) scribbles notes about the brothers elaborate projects hoping to craft the great Prussian novel. (In real life the brothers were German philologists.) They meet their match in a sour village occupied by a cruel Napoleonic officer (Jonathan Pryce.) Delatombe knows their tricks and orders the brothers to expose what he is sure is another hoax the disappearance from the town of all the most promising young girls. Just outside the town lurks Gilliams best character and creation an evil wood. The spiteful moving trees hide a melange of classic lore from the Big Bad Wolf to Rapunzel to Sleeping Beauty. Gilliam has always been good at conjuring dread from Centurions to pirates to Orwellian bureaucrats; here the wood smoke and cold shadows of an unforgiving primeval forest give the Grimms an understandable chill. Gilliams movie though loses its way in that same forest. The former Monty Python stalwart who helped direct ""Life of Brian"" and ""The Holy Grail"" is great at scenes but not so good at sustaining stories. The rapid-fire witty dialogue is full of the Python spirit that amalgam of the base metals of pre-industrial living and the modern alloys of irony and marketing. Yet we forget what all the bickering is for and what brave quest the Grimms are trying to talk themselves into. At one point Will demands of his scholarly brother ""Finish the story"" And Jake cries out on behalf of the director and the audience ""I dont know how"" Gilliam who famously abandoned a pet project on Don Quixote after spending millions needs someone around to remind him what he meant in the first place. With ""The Brothers Grimm"" Gilliam makes the trip to dreamland inspired silliness - its too bad the fairy tale drones on long after we weary children have fallen asleep.

YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Brothers Grimm Matt Damon Terry Gilliam or Create Your Own Manage Alerts | What Is This? (CNN) -- ""The Brothers Grimm"" directed by Terry Gilliam is visually stunning. Thats no surprise since Gilliam has a reputation as a visionary filmmaker.But ""visionary"" doesnt always mean ""good"" and in the case of ""The Brothers Grimm"" the outstanding scenic design and computer-generated effects overwhelm the extremely weak script by Ehren Kruger. What we have here isnt a movie its a coffee-table book.The films premise is promising. The film isnt about the real Brothers Grimm; its a fairy tale within a fairy tale set during the early Enlightenment when superstition and mythology still ran rampant. So with that in mind ...Once upon a time there lived two brothers the cynical and womanizing Wilhelm Grimm (Matt Damon) and the romantic dreamer Jacob Grimm (Heath Ledger). Together the brothers con naive European villagers into believing they can drive away trolls witches and every other kind of monster.When Napoleons army invades central Europe the Grimms jig is up. The pair is arrested by General Delatombe (Jonathan Pryce) the French governor -- now in charge of the conquered area -- and his inept henchman Cavaldi (Peter Stormare). Accused of kidnapping girls from the village of Marbaden the brothers along with a local huntress Angelika (Lena Headey) are sent into an enchanted forest to solve the mystery of the missing girls and thereby prove the brothers innocence.The forest is a wonder. The Grimms find gnarled trees that turn into monsters and an evil queen (Monica Bellucci) who is loosely based on the queen from ""Snow White."" There are also brief appearances by other classic Grimm characters including Little Red Riding Hood the Gingerbread Man Hansel and Gretel and Rapunzel.Youd think it would be enough to make an enchanting movie.Impossible to follow Monica Bellucci plays an elaborately dressed queen who may have something to do with the mystery. But there is no movie. To borrow Gertrude Steins assessment of Oakland California ""there is no there there."" The pictures are nice but the murky and muddy storyline of ""The Brothers Grimm"" is impossible to follow no matter how many breadcrumbs are left behind.Kruger may have penned the successful American version of the Japanese film ""The Ring"" but he also brought us the hideous movie ""Reindeer Games"" starring Ben Affleck.The acting doesnt help. Everyone hams it up and overacts up to the point of total embarrassment.""The Brothers Grimm"" was supposed to be released months ago but the studio was reportedly not pleased with the film and Gilliam -- who went off to direct another movie -- returned to the project six months later and made major changes. Sorry Terry. You wasted your time.If you want to see Gilliam at his best you should rent one of his other movies such as the inventive ""Brazil"" or perhaps ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" which he co-directed with Terry Jones.Unfortunately this attempt at bringing an offbeat tale to the big screen is a dud. If you must look for it at all try the discount bin at a local video store near you. It will look mighty nice there in a few months.

"Grimm stuffs magic and everything else into an erratic tale - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Grimm stuffs magic and everything else into an erratic tale By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  August 26 2005 Quick what do you get when you mix Hansel and Gretel Rapunzel Snow White the Frog Prince the Gingerbread Man Sleeping Beauty Little Red Riding Hood werewolves the Napoleonic Wars Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm a 1000-year-old Thuringian Queen and a director with Monty Python in his DNA and a penchant for shambolic overbudget follies?You get an absurd mess thats more entertaining than it has any right to be.The Brothers Grimm"" Terry Gilliams long-awaited return to the screen after a run of directors bad luck (see the 2002 documentary Lost in La Mancha"" for the dire evidence) is hardly a triumph. It is a Terry Gilliam movie though and thats worth something. This sprawling comic fantasia on the life and adventures of the early-19th-century siblings -- who collected and put to paper many of the fairy tales we now take for granted -- is overplotted overacted and over-art-directed with mossy sets and wonky digital effects crowding the frame.But because this is a filmmaker who truly believes that a movies not enough unless its too much there is genuine over-the-top magic here.After a brief and darkly funny childhood introduction we meet Jake (Heath Ledger) and Will (Matt Damon) as theyre traveling through French-occupied Germany scamming one village after another with a profitable ghost-busting act. Jake is the bespectacled scholar mortified that theyre trading on the old folk tales to make a quick thaler while Will is the cynical rake whos always ready to play a game of whos the fairest of them all"" with the local damsels.Theres a bit of Hope and Crosby to these two and remarkably little of Ledger and Damon. In fact I spent the first half of the movie trying to figure out whether that really was Damon under the vague British accent and the muttonchops. This is either talent or embarrassment.Captured by a French general (Jonathan Pryce wallowing in caricature) and his Italian adjutant Cavaldi (Peter Stormare even more so) the brothers are frog-marched to a distant village by the Forest of Marsbaden where children have been disappearing at an alarming rate where horses refuse to go and where the trees have minds of their own. Despite the presence of a fetching local huntress named Angelika (Lena Headey) Will wants to bolt. Jake is convinced he has found the mother of all primary sources.The Brothers Grimm"" never quite makes up its mind whether to play as the broadest of farces -- thats certainly what the director told Stormare who quickly grows tiresome -- as an action-filled buddy movie or as a tingly eldritch mystery of pagan beliefs taking back a little post-Enlightenment ground. When all the cylinders click the effect is transporting as when a glop of enchanted mud wipes a childs face right off her head and uses it to morph into a bratty gingerbread kid. When the pieces dont fit the movies just dank noise a poor cousin to Gilliams The Adventures of Baron Munchausen.""Without spoiling too much I can reveal that Brothers"" is lucky enough to actually have the fairest of them all -- that would be Monica Bellucci as a wicked queen with eternal youth on her agenda -- and a climax that looks both cluttered and nicely pre-Raphaelite. But the movie never does enough with the idea that the old fairy tales might be all thats left of a powerful pre-Christian world.The Brothers Grimm"" has been sitting on Miramaxs back shelf for the better part of a year and is getting a quick release before DVD oblivion and the fall appearance of Gilliams Tideland"" which from early reports is a much more ambitious work.Consider this an appetizer then from a gifted if bonkers movie visionary. The fact that were seeing it at all counts as a happy ending. Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

"A Disappointingly Grimm Tale washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On A Disappointingly Grimm Tale ""The Brothers Grimm"" Jake (Heath Ledger left) and Will (Matt Damon) are con artists turned heroes. (Dimension Films) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday August 26 2005 TRUTH ACCORDING to the Mirror Queen (Monica Bellucci) a character living under a curse in Terry Gilliams disappointing fairy-tale fantasia ""The Brothers Grimm"" is ""much more terrible than fiction."" In the case of Gilliams heavily (and rather pointlessly) fictionalized story of real-life German folklorist brothers Wilhelm and Jakob Grimm Im afraid the exact opposite is true. Well maybe not terrible so much as terminally silly. More enchanted than enchanting Gilliams movie (scripted by Ehren ""The Skeleton Key"" Kruger) reimagines the brothers referred to ever so contemporarily as Jake and Will as a pair of itinerant ""Van Helsing""-style ghostbusters. Think of them as ""Team Grimm"" to use the words of the smarmily charming Will (Matt Damon) who along with his bookish sibling (Heath Ledger) makes a living gulling superstitious early 19th-century German townsfolk out of their money by exorcising their barns of spirits demons witches and the like. With a background more in theater and the tricks of stagecraft than in the actual breaking of magic spells -- which Will doesnt even believe in but the more credulous Jake does -- the pair come in for a shock when they are recruited by a general of the occupying French army (Jonathan Pryce channeling Peter Sellerss Jacques Clouseau) to expose someone or something who has been haunting the forests of Marsbaden. When it turns out that whatever has been abducting the children of the village is in fact supernatural and not some charlatan using smoke and mirrors like the Grimms things get interesting. Or at least they could  if Gilliam and Kruger only knew what they were doing. Borrowing liberally from such footnotes to the frightfest canon as ""Exorcist The Beginning"" ""An American Werewolf in London"" and ""Ghostbusters"" the filmmakers cant ever seem to make up their minds whether they want us to laugh or to be scared (though truth be told its probably both). As a result we end up not doing a whole heck of a lot of either as when one manifestation of the towns resident evil takes the form of a Pillsbury Doughboy-shaped blob of mud which then proceeds to swallow a small child and jump down a well. Im supposed to be afraid of this thing which looks like a piece of brown flubber with a face? I have news for you It isnt even funny just weird. As for the main characters Jake is a jumpy histrionic mess with Ledger apparently having been told to limit his frantic acting to a narrow range of grunts and semi-verbal vocalizations including at one point a half-muttered ""okay."" Thats just one of the self-consciously anachronistic touches calculated to let us know that ""The Brothers Grimm"" doesnt take itself let alone its time period too you know seriously. Damon constantly flashing his newscasters teeth and flaunting a fake ""Masterpiece Theatre"" dialect comes across like someone who got lost on the way to an audition for a high school production of ""The Pirates of Penzance."" For some reason all the Germans -- unlike the French and even one Italian character called Cavaldi (Peter Stormare) -- have English accents including the brothers shared love interest Angelika (Lena Headey). One nice thing As with all of Gilliams films ""Grimm"" at least looks good though the special effects occasionally veer toward the cheesy. But what are we to make of all the Sturm und Drang? What the real Brothers Grimms work was all about is the ability of storytelling to tame and express our darkest fears to exert mastery over a frightening world both within and without our heads. And granted there is some nonsense toward the end of the film about the power of belief and the magic of the written word. But the movie which like ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" constantly winks at its own hipness never commits to anything other than a style. If only the movie trusted its own story as much as its central characters ultimately learn to trust theirs. In the final analysis what its more interested in is having a happy ending rather than actually earning one.

From its depiction of the German author-kin as con men to its frenetic and exhausted conclusion theres little appeal save for those looking for a late-August distraction. Not even a Venice competition slot will slow the films journey toward the video castle. As divorced in its own way from the original source material as the most antiseptic Disney fairy tale Terry Gilliams ""The Brothers Grimm"" is deeply lost in the woods. While the pic may have been theoretically a good match for one of cinemas most fabulist directors in practice the experiment reps a misconceived reframing of all things Grimm. From its depiction of the German author-kin as con men to its frenetic and exhausted conclusion theres little appeal save for those looking for a late-August distraction. Not even a Venice competition slot will slow the films journey toward the video castle. Working from a glibly conceptual screenplay by the busy Ehren Kruger (""The Skeleton Key"") Gilliam must have seen all sorts of possibilities stemming from the central idea of dropping the brothers down into a real-life situation in which some of their fictional characters and situations come to life. This split between reality and fantasy is something the director has played with many times before but the tilt here toward a hyperactive buddy-movie action-adventure with loud comic archetypes is a poor fit for a film that relies on fairy tale icons and themes. Nothing is less amusing than the set-up of Wilhelm (Matt Damon) and Jacob Grimm (Heath Ledger) as traveling con men in the early 19th century who foster backwoods German folks beliefs in witches and the like with elaborate special effects. If this is meant to be a joke about how artists can trick the senses it falls like a thud and has the effect of making what were actually quite engaging earnest but poverty-stricken young writers into a pair of shady fools. In typical buddy-pic fashion Will and Jake -- the anachronistic nicknames they give themselves -- are opposites Will is a skepticand ladies man and Jake a mystical private figure too much into his tales. Their cons are exposed and lead to their arrest at the hands of the fatuously silly torturer Cavaldi (Peter Stormare) whos in the pay of the Napoleonic Army. Down the road the village of Marbaden is feeling cursed. One young girl after another -- including a little one in a red riding hood -- have vanished without a trace into the menacing bosque where trees come alive. Accused of doing harm to the girls the brothers protest and are taken to Marbaden. Will assumes there is an elaborate piece of trickery going on but in trying to convince local huntress Angelika (Lena Headey) to accompany them the guys both find themselves attracted to her. Although the film foregoes much of the Grimms literature for a dumbed-down set of conflicts that turn even Napoleons finest (led by Jonathan Pryces theatrically spoofy Delatombe) into goons the mood in the forest is powerfully atmospheric as gnarled trees turn into nightmarish many-armed creatures and a power is loose that can make a horse go mad and gobble down a small child. Only for a brief interlude does an actual Grimm-like tale take center screen featuring a crumbling tower that had housed a murderous king and his queen (Monica Bellucci) now alone and desperately trying to reverse the aging process with touches here and there of the egoist queen in ""Snow White."" The brothers belabored efforts to scale the tower and reverse the queens evil powers lead the film into cumbersome action set pieces that are neither quite fairy-tale fanciful nor convincingly real. Its this in-between-ness along with Gilliams numbing use of filming with ultra wide-angle lenses that turn ""The Brothers Grimm"" into the directors glummest and most visually clunky production. Offsetting this tone to a degree is Ledger as a charming bumbler who really believes in dark powers. Damon does little more than a variation on his role as Linus in ""Oceans Eleven"" and ""Twelve."" trying to be a smooth nice-guy operator. Theyre both overwhelmed in the end by the pics sheer busyness.Stormare and Pryce ham it up to pointless excess. Even the terrific forest effects (and a stunning one of a boy transformed into the Gingerbread Man) get compromised by other under-realized ones some involving werewolf transformations. Taking his cues from the films worst tendencies composer Dario Marianelli has stitched bits of Bernard Herrmann stylings into a lumbering generic score.
