When his Tony- and Pulitzer Prize-winning AIDS-era update of Puccinis La Boheme set in New Yorks East Village opened in the mid 90s it was already a slight period piece and Columbuss widescreen version - with many of the original cast - seems more so not least since the Brownstones from which his outsider community face eviction have since fallen to Mayor Giulianis bulldozers. Its high-volume and relentlessly high-octane with Columbus presenting much of it as if shot on the camcorder of one of the principles presumably to reflect a sense of edge. Frankly the honestly held but self-conscious treatment of a multitude of themes from artistic integrity through poverty sexual identity to drug addiction and the ravages of AIDS never runs deep. There are some nicely choreographed large set-pieces and the odd touching scene but little else to shout about.

"Brokeback Mountain. Slate Sign In Sign Up Brokeback Mountain. Brokeback Mountain. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 8 2005 707 PM Lasso Me Tender Ang Lees Brokeback Mountain and a season of gay cinema. By David Edelstein Let somebody love you Desperado In dubbing Brokeback Mountain (Focus Features) ""Marlboro men in love"" Im not being flip. OK Im not only being flip. Ang Lees films often focus on the tension between peoples formal roles--those ritualized culturally mandated poses they feel compelled to strike--and the passions under the surface that struggle to express themselves. Even manners as elaborate as the ones in the martial-artsy (a readers phrase) Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon were destabilized by the characters unruly ardor and volcanic sex drives. So in Brokeback Mountain--adapted by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana from a plain but evocative story by Annie Proulx--you have two guys with slim hips and dungarees and cowboy hats pulled low. They lean against pickups smoke cigarettes and trade monosyllables (if that). Theyre suitable for framing. But in the course of an early 1960s summer herding sheep on an isolated Wyoming mountain they find themselves growing closer and closer and ... yes on Brokeback Mountain they make the beast with two broken backs. Advertisement Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger play the men. Gyllenhaals Jack Twist is the more extroverted one the rodeo rider the cowboy who makes cow eyes. Ledgers Ennis Del Mar is the quintessential Westerner of few words and the words he says are not always audible He speaks with a Wild West lockjaw thats sometimes annoying but also weirdly hypnotic. Ledgers performance is prime Oscar bait Hes ostentatiously immobile with uncanny low tones--his voice is 50 fathoms deep. The whole performance is subtextual. What does Brokeback Mountain (the place) symbolize? Its the natural world in which societys strictures fall away and these men can be true to their own natures--where dinners of canned beans yield to elk-hunting shirtless romps and hungry coupling. Lee and his cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto mirror the forces in play with vast mountain backdrops full of mysterious planes huge cumulous clouds slashes of lightning in the far distance and hailstones the size of apples. When Jake and Ennis return as they must to civilization they live amid squat faceless pre-fab buildings set far apart from one another and the flat landscapes once again mirror their emotions--now flat-lined. They take wives--Michelle Williams as Ennis high-school sweetheart Alma and Anne Hathaway as Lureen a kind of Texas rodeo queen with a wealthy daddy whos the perfect trophy for an up-and-comer like Jake. But these are passionless unions and Ennis drift into unemployment and alcoholism is relentless. Despite the physical distance between them (Ennis is in Wyoming Jake in Texas) they come together again and again and head back to the wild--aware that if theyre caught they could be lynched by all their neighbors those less-than-liberal ""real"" men who wouldnt know a real man if he fucked them in the ass. (Or maybe thats the only way they would know a real man.) The lovers wonder Can you build on Brokeback Mountain? Cartman on South Park famously dismissed independent movies as ""gay cowboys eating pudding."" I have no idea where the pudding image came from but Im bound to say that Brokeback Mountain could use a little more of it--by which I mean more sweat and other bodily fluids. Ang Lees formalism is so extreme that its often laughable and the sex is depicted as a holy union Gay love has never been so sacred. On the other hand Lee treats the wives as either sexless drudges (Williams) or lacquered mannequins (Hathaway). Williams gives a fine performance (more Oscar bait) as the kind of wife who inevitably gets labeled ""long-suffering"" but she seems to exist only in relation to her husband and only then to drag him down. Advertisement As distant as I felt from the movie there were people around me weeping uncontrollably at the end--gay men some of them and a few women who were moved by the spectacle of cowboys in tears. (This is actually something of a chick flick.) And I did find Brokeback Mountain more powerful in retrospect when its tone and images and emotions lingered beyond all its elevated Oscar-worthiness. There were also moments in which Lee deconstructed the cowboy persona so completely that he made me wonder Are a lot of cowboys like totally gay? Theres certainly a lot of breaking free for the holidays Tis the season to be gay--transvestite transsexual or prone to burst into song to express the anguish of AIDS. Mysterious and transfixing ... Youll be singing along to the soundtrack of Neil Jordans enchanting Breakfast on Pluto (Sony Pictures Classics) which boasts the most felicitous use of wall-to-wall pop songs Ive ever heard. T. Rexs ""Children of the Revolution"" is a special treat and while I hoped never to hear Bobby Goldsboros ""Honey"" again in this lifetime in context its extraordinarily winsome. The tone throughout is an improbably cheerful plaintiveness. Jordan adapted the movie with Patrick McCabe from McCabes novel. (They also made The Butcher Boy together.) Their small-town Irish hero/heroine--as the title would suggest a farther-out Holly Golightly--is Patrick ""Kitten"" Braden (Cillian Murphy). In chapters with superimposed titles he tells the story of his life beginning with being dumped by his mother on the steps of a church where the priest Father Bernard (Liam Neeson) squeamishly hands him off to a brusque foster mother. Shes none too happy when she finds the 10-year-old Patrick (played by Conor McEvoy) modeling her dresses She warns him that the next time shell make him parade through the street dressed like that and he says ""Promise?"" Advertisement Subtitled birds comment wryly on this turn--an example of Jordans playful technique the gaiety juxtaposed against acts of shocking brutality. (The Irish Republican Army looms large in the mid-70s.) Patrick/Kitten grows up obsessed with his absent mom whos said to resemble Mitzi Gaynor and flits off to London to track her down. Patricks poverty and homelessness in the big city is the stuff of nightmares but you never catch him brooding on it. Theres a bubble around him. In truth he seems slightly bonkers--on Pluto. And while bad people do bad things to him others treat him kindly Among his contacts are Brendan Gleesons surprisingly tender drunken laborer and Stephen Reas sad-sack Stan Laurel-esque magician. (Theres a touching semiparodic reenactment of Jordans The Crying Game.) Even a police investigator (Ian Hart) who roughs him up ultimately carts him to a welcoming house of ill repute to earn a ""decent"" living. With his unearthly face--high razor-sharp cheekbones that frame irradiated blue eyes--Cillian Murphy makes a mysterious and transfixing object. A more down-to-earth actor would sentimentalize Breakfast on Pluto and make for an awkward fit with its peculiar mix of tones. Murphys strangeness--his chill estrangement--makes his campy ""Kitten"" persona more poignant. Transvestitism is the only way that such a damaged soul can find beauty and harmony in a cold and colorless world. A thrill a minute Felicity Huffmans face is what holds you in Duncan Tuckers delightful Transamerica (The Weinstein Company) too but her semi-transsexual Bree (nee Stanley) Osbourne is the antithesis of a camp drag queen. A mismatched buddy road-trip picture in which the Los Angelino Bree shortly before her final operation discovers shes the father of a teenage son a homeless-in-Manhattan delinquent named Toby (soulful newcomer Kevin Zegers) Transamerica skirts sitcom terrain. But Huffman has purged all extravagant artifice from her manner. Shes smart enough to know that Bree would never risk calling attention to that artifice. A prim social conservative she doesnt believe that she is artificial. Despite a brief teenage experiment with a woman (it yielded Toby) she has no doubt that her male organ was a genetic screw-up. Advertisement Huffmans performance is a thrill-a-minute--and a thrill-a-motion. An actress playing a man playing a woman is a mind- as well as gender-bender but Huffmans face is made up to look as if shes right on the male-female border and her ladylike movements are studied with the timing always slightly off Before our eyes she deconstructs a woman and then puts her back together. When in Texas a Native American (Graham Greene) in a cowboy hat takes Bree for a born female and admires her form she shivers with pleasure and I felt sad that he would ever have to know the (rather misleading) truth. Toby opines that its weird to see an ""Indian in a cowboy hat."" He has a greater job of reorienting himself ahead of him He doesnt know that this uptight woman who bailed him out of juvenile detention (posing as a Christian do-gooder) is his sperm-donor. Transamerica has a couple of melodramatic turns and the paternity revelation is delayed unconscionably. But the movie builds to a marvelously over-the-top sequence in Brees upper-middle-class home in which her horrified Christian mother (a hilarious Fionnula Flanagan) lavishes attention on her new grandson (who doesnt know hes her grandson); her hapless Jewish father (Burt Young) fumbles to explain the family position on their sons transsexuality (""We love you but we dont respect you""); her cynical recovering-drug-addict sister (Carrie Preston) struggles to reconcile the trippy discontinuum between her brother and Bree; and Toby decides he wouldnt mind becoming Brees lover. Farce born of sadly irreconcilable impulses Bravo Cringe-worthy In a rare burst of discretion Ive put off writing about Rent (Columbia) in part because I dont want to seem unsympathetic to the emotions that gave birth to Jonathan Larsons musical and its subsequent--posthumous--enshrinement in Broadway culture. I dont share the view of some critics that this souped-up La Boheme is faux bohemianism no more authentic than a Gap ad. Its real--and on screen its really cringe-worthy. Not quite Phantom of the Opera cringe-worthy but not as much fun to blow raspberries at either. Rent is set in 1989 when too many people had already died from AIDS and too many were about to--before the current cocktail of meds brought the virus under control (somewhat). Most of the major characters are sick and when they open their mouths to sing--its undistinguished Lite Rock in the promiscuously emotive style of the numbers on American Idol--theyre quickly joined by other members of the large ensemble. I can see how comforting and inspiring this instant communal oneness might seem to some people but I found it tiresomely undramatic even saccharine. Not to mention monotonous. Chris Columbus directs fluidly (for him) but in a family-movie style that makes the musical seem even more homogenized than it probably is. Its like a ride at Disney World the Urban AIDS-Victim Jamboree. Click here to read David Leavitts essay on whether Brokeback Mountain is a gay film.

"RENT | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; rent ) RENT (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Memo to director Chris Columbus In most cases its a bad idea for a movie to be a direct representation of a play. ""Opening up"" the setting is sometimes not all thats necessary to make a stage production into something cinematic. In a theater an intimacy exists between the players and their audience. This cannot be replicated on the screen; a substitute must be found for this and a way must be divined to keep the energy level high. Successful musicals like West Side Story and Chicago find a way. Mediocre adaptations like RENT suffer and seem diminished as a result. This is not a review of RENT the live musical; it is a review of RENT the movie. The two are siblings but this is a classic example of how bad choices in transforming a story from one medium to another can have unpalatable results. RENT fans and there are a large number of devoted ones will have opinions of where Columbus went right and wrong. As a more casual movie-goer who saw the play once a number of years ago I was less than enthralled by this telling of Jonathan Larsons modern-day version of La Boheme. (When it comes to La Boheme updates I prefer Moulin Rouge.) RENT is a year-in-the-life of eight New Yorkers. The scenario begins on Christmas Eve 1989 and concludes 365 days later. The principals include Mimi (Rosario Dawson) an exotic dancer and heroin user who contracted HIV by sharing needles; Tom Collins (Jesse L. Martin) a gay man who is HIV+ and his transvestite lover Angel (Wilson Jermaine Heredia); Bon Jovi lookalike Roger (Adam Pascal) a musician whose past drug habit also put him in the HIV+ category; and aspiring documentary filmmaker Mark (Anthony Rapp). We also meet Marks ex-lover performance artist Maureen (Idina Menzel) and her new lesbian squeeze Joanne (Tracie Thomas). Finally theres Benny (Taye Diggs) who has sold his soul to the Man by marrying into money and threatening to evict his old friends Mark and Roger if they cant come up with their rent money. Story-wise RENT isnt that strong. When it first reached stages in the mid-1990s it was a revolutionary play - the first major musical to deal frankly with AIDS and HIV (four of the eight characters are afflicted). Today however it seems dated and a little naA-ve. The films political points are trite. Some of the interpersonal interaction works but even that is hampered by poor character development. Only a few of RENTs eight protagonists seem like real people Mimi Tom and Joanne. Everyone else is either half-formed unbelievable or a caricature. The movies central love story - that of Mimi and Roger - fails because Roger bears the dual cross of being self-absorbed and not interesting. Mimi on the other hand is a character looking for a much more engaging opposite. Of course whats supposed to elevate RENT above the level of the simple-minded is the music. In a live setting it works but at least as presented by Columbus it doesnt. Only about three songs (including the standout ""Seasons of Love"") are memorable. RENT is almost wall-to-wall music and much of it blends together into an uninspired continuum. Stopping to listen to the lyrics makes it apparent how banal many of these numbers are. Larson wrote RENTs music with the recognition that it would be performed in front of a crowd. Motion pictures make us a little more objective and RENT doesnt stand up well to the heightened scrutiny. Six of the eight original cast members return. However the two newcomers Rosario Dawson and Tracie Thoms arguably give the most convincing performances. Dawson has no trouble transfixing the camera especially when shes doing her exotic dance routines. It doesnt get any more sizzling in a PG-13 movie. From the original cast Jesse L. Martin (now a Law and Order mainstay) and Taye Diggs are effective. Unfortunately the other four seem both too old and too weak for the big screen adaptation. Columbus chooses to open RENT with a simple rendition of ""Seasons of Love."" The cast stands on a stage and sings to an empty auditorium. Its the movies most stirring scene. For an example of a way in which film and theater can elicit different responses consider Maureens performance art. Live its an effective (if bizarre) bit of fun. On screen its embarrassingly bad - an Ed Wood sequence that stops the movies uncertain momentum dead in its tracks. Columbus should have been shrewd enough to recognize what an utter failure this scene was on film but he didnt. RENT took ten years to reach the screen. During that decade a number of directors have been attached including Spike Lee (whose concept of the film would have been to make it more gritty and cut a lot of the musical numbers). The best thing that can be said about Columbus version is that its faithful to its source material. (This is the directors trademark - consider his slavish adaptations of the first two Harry Potter books.) But theres no inspiration and too little energy. RENT is mediocre and recommended only to those who can claim a familiarity with the play. Others will likely leave the multiplex with little desire ever to see the production on stage which is a shame since thats when RENT pays off.

With Ryan Reynolds Anna Faris. (96 min.)""Just Friends"" reeks of low-expectations but delivers big returns. Chris a former fat kid who blossoms into a handsome music executive returns to ""Jersey"" to woo his dream girl. On the way the story breathes new life into tired topics such as high school sweethearts sibling rivalries and ditsy celebs. With Reynolds in the lead role supported by a frenetic cast director Roger Kumble wisely picks a brisk tempo from the get-go and never breaks cadence for long gags or gushiness. Reynoldss unfailing deadpan makes him the Chevy Chase for a new generation of National Lampoons. Grade A- Matt BradleySex/Nudity 12 scenes of innuendo and frank talk about sex. Violence 1s slapstick scenes. Profanity 69 expressions. Drugs 6 scenes with drinking. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? The Libertine (Not rated)Director Laurence Dunmore. With Johnny Depp John Malkovich. (130 min.) Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 The advance word on ""The Libertine"" was so bad that I was rather surprised to find it - unterrible. As the depraved John Wilmot the second Earl of Rochester Johnny Depp adds yet another sly sleazoid to his burgeoning portrait gallery. The 17th century Wilmot was like a junior-league Casanova and his descent here from raunchy fop to syphilitic wastrel is lovingly detailed by Dunmore. That detail however is obscured by some of the darkest tableaux this side of the Bat Cave. Grade B-- Peter RainerRent (PG-13)Director Chris Columbus. With Rosario Dawson Taye Diggs. (135 min.)The musical ""Rent"" won just about every award known to man and its tortuous route to Hollywood has been well documented. Now that it is at last on screen my reaction is ... whats all the fuss? As directed by Columbus Jonathan Larsons East Village reworking of ""La Boheme"" in the age of AIDS retains its calisthenic pathos as well as most of its original cast but youd have to be a real Rent-Head (apparently their numbers are legion) to envisage Academy Awards in its future. As a new addition to the corps Dawson is like a human Slinky. This is meant as a compliment. Grade B-- P.R.Yours Mine amp; Ours (PG)Director Raja Gosnell. With Dennis Quaid Rene Russo. (90 min.)""Yours Mine amp; Ours"" is a remake of a 1968 movie of the same title starring Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball. But for audiences the films slapdash writing and slapstick performances by Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo look more like a faithful mimicry of every other ""big family"" family comedy from ""The Sound of Music"" to ""Cheaper by the Dozen."" Thats not to say that kids wont have a blast. True to its Nickelodeon roots each scene oozes with sight gags oddly astute pets and gallons of goo. For adults the films offers a bloated ""Brady Bunch"" covered in slop. Grade C- M.B.Still in releaseBee Season (PG-13)Directors Scott McGehee David Siegel. With Richard Gere Flora Cross. (104 min.)Eliza (Cross) is an 11-year-old spelling prodigy. Her father Saul (Gere) believes she communicates with God according to the precepts of Kabbalah which hold that the alphabet contains the secrets of the universe. As Eliza advances to the National Spelling Bee championship her mother becomes unhinged and her brother rebels by joining the Hare Krishnas. Saul is stocked with inner demons but as is often the case with Gere he seems to draw all his energies from the surface. ""Bee Season"" at its core is about the ways in which family members wreak destruction on each other with the best of intentions. GradeBChicken Little (G)Director Mark Dindal. With the voices of Zach Braff Joan Cusack. (77 min.)Its finally happened. The Walt Disney Studio which pioneered hand-drawn animation has made its first fully animated computer feature ""Chicken Little."" Is the sky falling? No tears need be shed This fast and funny comedy which will be shown in digital 3-D in select theaters demonstrates that Disney can survive quite well without Pixar. The visuals are irrepressibly witty and so is the script which morphs from the classic fable into a spoof on ""War of the Worlds."" I prefer this version to Spielbergs. Grade A-Derailed (R)Director Mikhal Hafstrom. With Jennifer Aniston Clive Owen. (100 min.)""Derailed"" is a penny dreadful with A-list stars. Clive Owen who really should have tried harder to be cast as the next James Bond plays a Chicago ad executive who meets a magnetically friendly commuter played by Jennifer Aniston on the morning train to work. Though both are married with children they soon find themselves booking a seedy hotel room. Enter Vincent Cassel who one might think had his fill of this kind of thing after starring in ""Irreversible."" What happens next shall remain a secret but heres a hint Retribution awaits. Heres another Stay home. Grade CSex/Nudity 6 scenes. Violence 10 scenes including rape. Profanity 86 harsh expressions. Drugs 8 scenes with smoking. 9 scenes with drinking.Get Rich or Die Tryin (R)Director Jim Sheridan. With 50 Cent Joy Bryant Terrence Howard. (134 min.)Lightning didnt strike twice. Eminem made an improbably strong movie debut in ""8 Mile"" but now theres ""Get Rich or Die Tryin"" which stars his rapper protege Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson. I had high hopes - its director is Jim Sheridan (""My Left Foot"" ""In America""); and Terence Howard whos on a roll has a meaty part in it. But this thinly autobiographical gangsta odyssey never achieves liftoff and Jackson is unconvincing. Even if you are playing (essentially) yourself it helps if youre an actor first. Grade C-- P.R.Sex/Nudity 11 scenes including nudity and sex Violence 19 scenes including torture. Profanity 295 harsh expressions. Drugs 5 scenes with drinking 7 scenes with smoking and 11 scenes with drug use or selling.Pride amp; Prejudice (PG)Director Joe Wright. With Keira Knightley Judi Dench Matthew Macfadyen. (135 min.)One of the great romances in the canon Jane Austens ""Pride and Prejudice"" has been adapted for TV five times but only once before as a movie. If young audiences respond to director Wrights version set in the late 18th century it will be because he has brought out the vigor in Austens romance in a way that the other adaptations never quite accomplished. Keira Knightley triumphantly comes into her own as Elizabeth the heroine. Grade ASex/Nudity 3 scenes of mild innuendo. Violence None. Profanity None. Drugs 8 scenes with drinking. 1 scene with smoking.The Legend of Zorro (PG)Director Martin Campbell. With Antonio Banderas Catherine Zeta-Jones. (100 min.)""The Legend of Zorro"" made me long to re-watch ""Zorro the Gay Blade"" the spoof starring George Hamilton. In that film the Spanish accents sound deliberately fake. Here even Banderas has a hard time sounding authentic. Zorros nemesis a French aristocrat plans to blow up America. He seems to be under the misapprehension that Zorro is James Bond. Grade C-Zathura A Space Adventure (PG)Director Jon Favreau. With Tim Robbins Frank Oz Jonah Bobo. (113 min.)Two squabbling brothers home alone for a few minutes find an old board game in the basement with mysterious not to mention dangerous properties. Once the duo sets the game in motion they not only find their home adrift in outer space but also have to learn teamwork to cope with a demented robot and attacks by Zorgons (meat-eating pyromaniac lizard-men). Here appropriately retro effects and family values outweigh an episodic script. After the screening a preteen next to this critic asked his mom ""Why did you think I wouldnt like this?"" Theres your endorsement. Grade B-- M.K. TerrellSex/Nudity 1 instance of mild innuendo. Violence 15 scenes. Profanity 5 mild expressions. Drugs None.

Back in the 90s the Broadway musical ""Rent"" about a group of young bohemians in the East Village staged a very cynical -- and very successful -- ad campaign aimed directly at a young audience who saw musicals as something rather out-of-date. Posters with chic photos of the attractive young cast and the words ""Dont you just hate the word musical?"" papered the subways and ""Rent"" became a runaway hit. (Also contributing to its high profile the tragic death of its talented young creator Jonathan Larson just before the shows Off-Broadway opening.) The irony here is that ""Rent"" is very much an old-fashioned musical at heart inspired by the opera ""La Boheme"" and culminating in a scene in which a dying woman is revived by the power of a song. (An earlier character dies with less fanfare; perhaps somebody should have remembered to sing at him.) And while the New York stage productions were highly stylized and theatrical with abstract sets featuring junk sculptures and scaffolding the new movie is oddly traditional and realistic down to the last candle in those East Village lofts. Its ""Rent"" straight as it were though you wonder how they afford the candles. And how you respond to it may have a great deal to do with how you feel about the material to begin with. The Rentheads (the shows famous cult) will likely be pleased to see most of the original cast featured in the film and the reverence with which Larsons songs are treated. Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Rent"" with Rosario Dawson Taye Diggs Wilson Jermaine Heredia Jesse L. Martin Idina Menzel Adam Pascal Anthony Rapp Tracie Thoms. Directed by Chris Columbus from a screenplay by Stephen Chbosky based on the musical by Jonathan Larson. 128 minutes. Rated PG-13 for mature thematic material involving drugs and sexuality and for some strong language. Several theaters. Those less attached to the ""Rent"" legend may well find the film a little puzzling; what works well on a bare stage may be less compelling when swarming with meticulous detail. Though crowded theres an earnest spareness to the film unlike ""Chicago"" or ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" two recent movie musicals that found their pulse through a witty glittery over-the-top stylization that still managed to let heart -- and fine performances -- peek through. In Chris Columbus screen version most of the musical numbers arent stylized (a natty tango number is an exception) but based in a Hollywood-gritty reality that at times feels silly. The first big number features an entire block full of people burning their eviction notices and wondering in song about how theyll pay the rent and its exhilarating -- and then it ends and the people just seem to wander away as if theyre going to go sing on the next block now. Columbus doesnt seem to know what to do with the moment (perhaps he hasnt watched enough musicals) and its jolting -- were taken out of the story then back again. With a cast now a little too old for their roles a little too immaculately styled and coiffed and sometimes giving performances that feel too big for their close-ups the film too often feels like what ""Rent"" was never meant to be false. Theres still much to enjoy particularly the whirlwind that is Idina Menzel (whose oddly snarling distinctive allure is given the star treatment) or the elegance that is Taye Diggs. Larsons message of acceptance and love twinkles sweetly through the film and the songs will remain in your head long afterwards. But I kept wondering about a different kind of movie of ""Rent"" which well probably never see one with a cast of 22-year-old unknowns a handheld camera and a dream. Less in this case might well have been more.

Photo Phil Bray AIDS and drugs ravage a group of New Yorkers but they still manage to kick up a lot of joy in Rent 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Rent Musical. Starring Rosario Dawson Anthony Rapp Adam Pascal Idina Menzel Wilson Jermaine Heredia Taye Diggs and Sarah Silverman. Directed by Chris Columbus. (PG-13. 128 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In the glory era of the Hollywood musical audiences didnt question how Gene Kelly could blithely sing and dance in the rain and not be put in a straitjacket. But todays younger generation has trouble suspending disbelief when characters spontaneously burst into song -- although not when they speed through barricades that would impede King Kong . With the ingenuity of a cat burglar filmmakers plot ways to sneak into musical territory while readying an alibi in case theyre caught. No such attempt is made to disguise the Broadway roots of ""Rent"" perhaps suggesting that the filmmakers are counting on narcissistic youth to watch any movie about people their age. The opening number ""Seasons of Love"" is set on a bare soundstage with each singer standing in a spotlight. ""Rent"" tries to have it both ways alternating the studied falseness of theater -- Kabuki comes to mind -- with cinematic moments spilling out into the mean streets of lower Manhattan. More than 30 minutes of dialogue have been added to the acclaimed 1996 show which was almost entirely sung. The effect is unsettling like watching a movie spliced together with a filmed stage production. Yet to director Chris Columbus credit his schizoid approach works more often than not. Related Stories Rent opens up Broadway version If nothing else the movie reveals Jonathan Larsons musical to be an illuminating time capsule of a wild period immediately before and after the scourge of AIDS. Larson who died of an aneurysm before the Broadway opening wrote from deep inside himself. His emotions spill over in this story loosely based on Puccinis ""La Boheme"" of friends several of them HIV-positive struggling to rekindle the joy of the early 1980s as the decade winds to a less than ecstatic end. Whether the experiences he describes happened or not they feel lived in. His songs arent particularly memorable -- none became a breakaway hit -- but they are contextual and advance the action. ""No Day but Today"" is about the tunnel vision of the young. ""Light My Candle"" with its echo of ""Light My Fire"" is an act of seduction. Mimi (a glowing Rosario Dawson) climbs through the window of her neighbor Roger (Adam Pascal who like many of the cast members originated his role onstage) ostensibly to borrow a match but really to flirt. ""Tango Maureen"" -- the movies most exuberant number opening up to dozens of dancers performing the classic step-step-step-step-close -- explains the bisexual appeal of a performance artist (Idina Menzel camping it up) for whom the song is named. One of her lovers is an aspiring filmmaker Mark (Anthony Rapp) who is continually capturing his pals exuberant if destructive behavior with a hand-held camera. Columbus makes creative use of Marks raw footage playing it on about a third of the screen and leaving the rest dramatically dark. Its a way to bring back exhilarating times. In Marks home movie the drag queen Angel (a winning Wilson Jermaine Heredia in the role he won a Tony for) prances around in a miniskirt before illness takes its toll. The gang is shown ushering out 1988 at a ribald New Years Eve street party unable to foresee the disasters ahead. ""Rent"" may once and for all change Columbus image as Hollywoods Kriss Kringle who spreads goodwill in his sunny movies. Nobody can accuse him of sugar coating ""Rents"" dark subjects like loss homelessness disease and heroin addiction. Theres a truly ugly scene of druggies shooting up in an alley. Pre-Rudy Giuliani New York has never looked more skuzzy. Rubbish is piled on the streets and every building in sight is covered in graffiti. Columbus who lives in San Francisco used Sixth Street between Mission and Market to stand in for the worst parts of the East Village but he also shot on New Yorks Avenues A and B. Development is coming to the low-rent neighborhood where the friends live. Former pal Benny (Taye Diggs) has married their landlords daughter and is trying to get them evicted. Diggs was a bigger presence on Broadway gracefully roaming the stage. He barely appears in the movie. It would have been far better to see more of him and less of the commitment ceremony for Maureen and her lesbian lover an episode that seems lifted from ""The L Word."" While there are no sluggish performances Dawsons is the most energetic. Whether slithering down a pole at the Cat Scratch Club where shes an exotic dancer or throwing herself at a reluctant Roger her Mimi is Sally Bowles reincarnated. Her sparkle shines through pale makeup meant to show the ravages of a drug habit. Hot comic Sarah Silverman has a small but funny role as the head of a tabloid TV show that hires Mark. By strange coincidence in her new performance film ""Sarah Silverman Jesus Is Magic"" she describes the fictional show as ""about AIDS but its also a musical."" She could have been talking about ""Rent."" Advisory This film contains disturbing scenes of drug use.

Orange mans 2nd trial nets life term in killing - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Sentence Orange mans 2nd trial nets life term in killingJuly 10 2009|By Sarah Lundy and Amy L. Edwards Sentinel Staff WritersA judge sentenced a 22-year-old Orange County man to life in prison without parole Thursday in a 2006 fatal shooting during a drug deal gone wrong.Deangelo Conner was convicted last month of first-degree murder armed robbery and two counts of robbery with a firearm.Florida law required Circuit Judge Bob Wattles to sentence Conner to life in prison for the murder conviction.Conner had turned down a 25-year plea offer and took his chances at trial.His first trial ended in a mistrial after jurors were heard discussing the case before it was allowed.Authorities say Conner shot Ricardo Rivera 41 once in the chest July 6 2006.Conner and two others initially set up the meeting as a drug buy but they never intended to pay for anything the prosecution said; the three planned to grab the drugs and run.At one point Conner pulled out a gun and fired at Rivera. Conner told investigators that Rivera was charging toward him and he was merely protecting himself.The jury didnt buy it.Several of Ricardo Riveras relatives attended the sentencing including his children and brother Robert Rivera who read statements from several people.In a statement Ricardo Riveras ex-wife wrote that the hardest thing she has had to do was tell her children they no longer had a father.The woman wrote that her familys hurt will never go away.

As it nears a decade of residence at the Nederlander Theatre where it has played nearly 4000 performances Rent is now the eighth longest-running show in Broadway history and it continues to draw a roughly 75 percent capacity crowd on a weekly basis. Legions of fans swear by the thing -- just as people live for John Grisham or consider The Shawshank Redemption one of the greatest movies ever made. And last I checked there was no legislation pending before Congress that would curtail such behavior -- though perhaps there should be. Ive never seen Rent onstage but after watching the long-in-the-works film version directed by Chris Columbus I felt as though I had. Thats because Columbus late of the first two Harry Potter films isnt the kind of director who brings a fertile cinematic imagination to a project. Rather when he takes on a sacrosanct pop-culture object like Potter or Rent he labors to preserve its molecular infrastructure no matter that the work was originally conceived for a different medium. So just as Columbus Potter movies never fully loosed themselves from the written page theres scarcely a moment in Rent -- save for one production number ""The Tango Maureen"" which is lively enough to suggest that someone else directed it -- that doesnt feel terminally stagebound. Columbus doesnt direct scenes so much as he records them in long meandering crane and Steadicam shots as if he were documenting a live stage show for future television broadcast. Even when he films in real New York City locations he renders them as inert as a studio back lot. If the great movie musicals are the ones that transport us to some heady superreality the only place Rent takes us to is the Nederlander Theatre. So what exactly is Columbus preserving? Based in part on La Boheme -- you know that famous opera by Baz Luhrmann -- Rent observes 525600 minutes in the lives of the healthiest-looking most highly functional junkies strippers AIDS patients and starving artists who populate the cold-water flats of New York Citys Lower East Side circa 1989. Theres Mark (Anthony Rapp) our narrator and an aspiring filmmaker who resolves early on to ""start shooting without a script""; his roommate Roger (Adam Pascal) a leather-jacketed singer-songwriter reeling from his girlfriends suicide and occasionally plucking out a few bars of ""Quando Men Vosoletta"" on his guitar; and ""computer-age philosophy"" professor Collins (Jesse L. Martin) who despite being the most gainfully employed of the bunch hasnt lost touch with his neighborhood roots. The same cant be said alas of Benny (Taye Diggs) a onetime local who married a rich real-estate developers daughter and now plans to turn Mark and Rogers loft into ""a state-of-the-art digital interactive studio."" Whatever the hell that means. The characters in Rent suffer for their art -- we never really find out if any of them are actually talented but were asked to believe that theyre all brilliant -- and they suffer in other ways too. The whole movie is like a paean to the nobility of suffering. Marks ex-girlfriend the aforementioned artist Maureen (Idina Menzel) has recently ditched him for an attorney named Joanne (Tracie Thoms). Roger and Collins are both HIV-positive -- something which in Rogers case becomes fodder for a song ""I Should Tell You."" Fortunately for Roger the object of his desire the beautiful but tragic Mimi (Rosario Dawson) is HIV-positive herself -- and a junkie and a stripper to boot which I suppose makes her the winner of the Alphabet City triple crown. And just to make sure he has all his bases covered Larson throws in one interracial lesbian engagement party a wisdom-spouting homeless prophet and a Latino cross-dressing street performer unsubtly named Angel (Wilson Jermaine Heredia). No oppressed minority or special-interest group is left unturned (save perhaps for paraplegic albino hermaphrodites). Was Larson really hoping to have a career on Broadway or was that just going to be his springboard into politics? As in Phantom the music is staggeringly brain-meltingly terrible -- loud rock anthems and power ballads of a sort that makes Jon Bon Jovi seem like well Puccini. The cast members who are supposed to be playing characters in their late teens and early twenties dont look a day younger than 35; and theres not a character onscreen who has more dimension than a cardboard backdrop. You also dont have to think too long or hard to come up with a list of deeper more honest studies of la vie boheme -- my own mind immediately drifted to Alex Coxs Sid amp; Nancy with its unflinching portrait of emotional and chemical dependencies. (By comparison in Rent Mimis entire odyssey from addict to withdrawal to re-addiction is condensed into one montage sequence.) But Rent isnt trying to be honest; its selling a fantasy with the emphasis on selling. Although Larson supposedly based Rent on people he knew the whole enterprise feels as shallow impersonal and opportunistic as one of those Hollywood action blockbusters designed to be easily translated into other languages and cultural idiom. True to form the stage version of Rent has conquered the globe playing in such far-flung destinations as Africa and South Korea. Surely the film will too. For the considerably cheaper price of a movie ticket new audiences can now be showered with such meaningless up-with-people aphorisms as ""No day but today"" ""Take me for what I am"" and ""How about love?"" They can be reminded that no matter how grim things get theyll work themselves out for the best (or how failing that theyll become martyrs who inspire all their friends to live their lives to the fullest). And they can rest assured that by swallowing this hooey they are somehow expressing their own individuality just like all the lemmings in their Che Guevara T-shirts. Rent wants to teach the world to sing all right but only if the world buys a Coca-Cola first.

Martin Adam Pascal Tracie Thoms; Director Chris Columbus; Author Stephen Chbosky Chris Columbus; Release Date Wide 11/23/2005; Runtime (in minutes) 135; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Revolution Studios Posted December 2 2005 -- 1200 AM EST Jonathan Larsons pop-rock tribute to the East Village bohemia of the late 1980s doesnt look like a musical that would age well but what was oppressive on stage -- all that righteous passion -- is lightened liberated in the film. The characters dont just break into song; they burst into who they are. What shines through is the beauty of Larsons bohemia not to be a rebel but simply to be alive.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post First a caveat. From its opening moments ""Rent"" signals the challenges and pitfalls of finally bringing Jonathan Larsons Tony Award-winning 1996 Broadway play inspired by Puccinis opera ""La Boheme"" to the screen. In the kind of musical overture that so often ushers in many a theatrical musical the cast sings one of ""Rents"" finest songs ""Seasons of Love."" ""525600 minutes 525600 moments so dear. 525600 minutes - how do you measure measure a year? In daylights in sunsets in midnights in cups of coffee. In inches in miles in laughter in strife. In 525600 minutes - how do you measure a year in the life?"" The multi-ethnic friends stand on a stage singing in a sweet staccato to an empty house. Of course the house isnt empty. Its become a multiplex theater and moviegoers are the audience beyond the fourth wall. With this early juxtaposition director Chris Columbus asserts and assures us that he is not going to pretend ""Rent"" didnt have its birth onstage. He may even embrace the beautiful brilliant lunacy that is American musical theater. When the overture fades a montage of grainy images flickers on a screen. This movie within a movie comes from Mark (Anthony Rapp) the hopeful documentarian who makes a portrait of his East Village friends living on the borderline of the 80s-90s divide. Its the theater-movie divide that remains vast. ""Rent"" falls betwixt and between the odd intimacy of theater and the glorious bigness of film - and vice versa. Director Chris Columbus film leaves us with this key question How is it that something as artificial as musical theater can shake us to our core while the power of films immediacy leaves us cold? ""Seasons of Loves"" lyrics still celebrate Larsons acute awareness of plenty and possibility loss and mourning. And existential as those themes are they were particularly apt in New York City in the late 80s the period in which ""Rent"" is set. (Sadly legendarily Larson died the night before the Broadway preview of his landmark musical.) AIDS and a real-estate avarice that has only become more hungry since ""Rents"" 1996 success fuel Larsons rock opera of ""bohemians"" living - and yes dying - in the East Village. Mimi lives in the same rundown building as Mark and aspiring rocker Roger (Adam Pascal) more loftlike than most of the tenements in Manhattans East Village. But then the characters need room to sing to dance. Like Roger Mimi has AIDS. With the exception of Rosario Dawson (""25th Hour"" ""Sin City"") who plays drug-addicted Mimi nearly all of the roles are played by the actors who originated them on stage Idina Menzel as performance artist and tormenting lesbian Maureen; Pascal as Roger who hopes to make just one song; Taye Diggs as friend turned real-estate creep Benny. The movies reliance on the original cast is an especially fine gesture when it comes to Jesse L. Martin (""Law and Order"") who plays philosophy professor Tom Collins and Tony-winner Wilson Jermaine Heredia as Angel. A philosophy professor and his drag queen soul mate might seem like too much of an invention. Yet Tom and Angels love story trumps that of Mimi and Roger. While Pascal has a big beautiful voice Roger always sounds angry. Yes hes furious that he has AIDS that his girlfriend committed suicide that he hasnt found that one glorious song but its really his play-to-the-cheap-seats voice that makes for all the prickly ire. I loved the Broadway version of ""Rent."" As they say its a thin line between love and hate. Although hate is too strong a word for my disappointment in this adaptation of ""Rent."" My vested interest in the movies successful transit from stage to screen was twofold I loved the play when I saw it on Broadway with the original cast. And I want to see if filmmakers can continue to tease new audiences for the movie musical. Toward the end of the movie were privy to the film Marks been working so hard on. Much like Columbus version it has powerful scenes memorable moments - ones that make us smile or tear. What it doesnt have is the perfect rhythm of a well-honed movie.

YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Drama Movies or Create Your Own Manage Alerts | What Is This? (CNN) -- Ive never seen the stage musical ""Rent"" but the movie had me at hello.The film kicks off with the shows best-known song ""Seasons of Love"" and the edgy energy emotional power and its message of hope and love just kept building until the films conclusion.This Pulitzer Prize-winning rock musical has retained most of the original players from the off-Broadway show -- it quickly moved uptown to Broadway -- and thats extremely unusual for Hollywood. It paid off with performances that fit the actors like a second skin.The musical is still playing on the Great White Way with nearly 4000 performances to date.This story about disenfranchised youth living on the edge of society is the best urban-based musical of its kind since ""West Side Story."" The two share a number of similarities. ""West Side Story"" of course found its inspiration from Shakespeares ""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""Rent"" traces its roots to Puccinis classic opera ""La Boheme."" Both are populated with characters living on the edge of society with songs driving the narrative.After nearly 10 years the musicals subject matter and location -- AIDS and the bleak Lower East Village of Manhattan -- have changed dramatically. Thousands of people are now living with the deadly disease due to new miracle drugs and the Lower East Side has become gentrified. But the movies theme remains relevant young people trying to figure out their place in a world they dont necessarily respect or want to be a part of.The large ensemble cast of angry bohemians includes aspiring songwriter Roger (Adam Pascal); Rogers roommate and wannabe filmmaker Mark (Anthony Rapp); computer genius Tom (portrayed by Jessie L. Martin best known for his role as detective Ed Green on the TV show ""Law amp; Order""); Toms cross-dressing lover Angel (Wilson Jermaine Heredia who won a Tony for this role); and Benny (Taye Diggs) who betrayed his friends when he married their landlords daughter and is now threatening the group with eviction from their seedy loft apartments.The two new cast members who werent from the original group are lawyer Joanne (Tracie Thoms) and Rogers downstairs neighbor Mimi (Rosario Dawson.)Their raw and poignant stories are based on real people and observations made by the musicals creator Jonathan Larson who wrote the book music and lyrics. He knew his subject matter extremely well since he lived on the Lower East Side. But he tragically passed away from an aortic aneurysm on the eve of the plays first preview.Rather than let this awful and completely unexpected turn of events tear them apart the cast pulled together and became empowered by this musical which would be Larsons final gift to the world.They decided to put all of their talent hearts and souls into ""Rent"" as a tribute to Larson.Ironically the musical is about young people finding their personal passions trying to merge their artistic talents with a soulless corporate world and deciding how to spend their lives. Larson at the age of 35 seemed to have found his own answers to these questions but his life was cut short just as he was about to fullfill his greatest dream.While this movie is definitely an ensemble piece Rapps portrayal of Mark the filmmaker who documents his friends lives and guides the audience through the gritty underbelly of Alphabet City is a standout.Dawson is also excellent as Mimi Marquez a heroin-addicted exotic dancer with a cartload of emotional baggage.Chris Columbus who is best known as a director of comedies would not be on my short list for helming this project. At times he uses a sledgehammer to get his points across and some of his shots seem repetitive but overall Larsons powerful story comes shining through.The making of this movie was a family affair. One of the co-producers is Julie Larson Jonathans sister and his father Al was on the set every day.Overall ""Rent"" is a gut-wrenching experience. Yes its a tale about that particular time and place in New York City but it still contains contemporary issues about life and how you plan to live it.

Browse over 8 million products  Clothing amp; Jewelry  Computers amp; Electronics  Home amp; Garden  Kids amp; Family Rent fails to pony upBy Mike Clark USA TODAY The movie Rent brings to mind The Phantom of the Opera from last December and A Chorus Line from almost exactly 20 years ago. The New York stage smashes became more like Yucca Flats dinner theater on the big screen. With a song in their hearts Adam Pascal and Rosario Dawson are in Rents ensemble. Columbia Pictures So it is with the movie of Jonathan Larsons Rent ( ) in which stage-like characterizations clash against realistic East Village settings and homogenized production numbers. With heavy HIV subtext and a couple of actors who have scored in other films this La Boheme spinoff about fatal illness drug addiction and eviction ought to be less of a slog than it is. Stage original Taye Diggs playing an erstwhile friend turned evictor actually made a stronger screen impression in Malibus Most Wanted. And wont most viewers say ""Diggs controls the building; why should he put up with deadbeats however likable they are?"" Of course its the job of stage artifice to paper over such rude real-life questions. This is why New York-driven movie musicals can be hard to finesse. West Side Story did it (though some didnt think so at the time) thanks to its visuals choreography editing Natalie Woods aura and two Oscar-winning performances. The great Milos Formans Hair the movie Rent most recalls didnt -- though Forman got the kind of stylish honorable failure out of it that Chris Columbus (Home Alone and the first two Harry Potter films) cant claim here. As on-screen apartment-squatters go there was more musical magic when Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman danced delightedly to the ""Orange Juice on Ice"" radio jingle in Midnight Cowboy. (Opens Wednesday nationwide. PG-13 for mature thematic material involving drugs/sexuality; strong language. Running time 2 hours 15 minutes.)

Director Chris Columbus has pasted the grungy ""La Boheme"" update onto film with slavish respect for the original material but a shortage of stylistic imagination and raw emotions. ""No day but today"" feels like yesterdays news in the long-aborning screen version of Jonathan Larsons Pulitzer-winning rock musical ""Rent."" Director Chris Columbus has pasted the grungy ""La Boheme"" update onto film with slavish respect for the original material but a shortage of stylistic imagination and raw emotions. Result is like watching a dancer with no rhythm; it approximates the moves but rarely gets an infectious groove on. Hardcore fans of the long-running Broadway show will constitute an automatic audience but Sony is unlikely to lure the uninitiated in major numbers. Premiered Off Broadway in 1996 the show connected with audiences via its melancholy romanticism and harnessing of the stark realities of AIDS drugs homelessness and life on the margins. There was the added poignancy of the tragedy of creator Larson who died the night of final dress rehearsal days before his 36th birthday. Eighth on the all-time Broadway list of long-runners at nearly 4000 performances ""Rent"" has now grossed more than 210 million from its New York engagement alone. But the musicals of-the-moment edge has faded. The East Village where the storys struggling artists squatters junkies and misfits reside is now considerably more gentrified; AIDS treatment has evolved radically; and the gloomy shadow of Reaganomics and yuppie greed that hung heavily over big-city fringe-dwellers has been replaced by more insidious sociopolitical specters. While ""Rent"" is not as obsolete as other film versions of zeitgeist-specific musicals -- like ""Godspell"" or ""Hair"" -- nor as leaden as last years ""Phantom of the Opera"" it feels past its prime. The muscular treatment by ace music producer Rob Cavallo best known for his work with Green Day supplies driving power to the songs thats rarely matched in the narrative while Columbus cluttered idea of how to film a musical seems to reference ""Fame"" in its repeated dancing on tables and seemingly endless running through trash-strewn streets holding hands. The film opens with the shows best known song ""Seasons of Love"" which onstage kicks off the second act but here strives for emotional peaks with characters we have yet to meet. Columbus then pumps up the title song into an angry bohemian anthem with main characters and hoards of extras railing against the insanity of modern life from their fire escapes in an Alphabet City saturated with graffiti rubble and trashcan fires. The show has always been something of an inelegant narrative jumble held together by empathy for its characters. Screenwriter Stephen Chbosky does little to alter that supplying threadbare dialogue that stitches one song to the next without weaving a dramatic fabric. The central thread of downtowners battling to survive connect and cultivate some kind of artistic purity in an increasingly soulless corporate world is still there. But the threat of eviction of being forced to sell out or of succumbing to illness or drug addiction never acquires much urgency. Chboskys chief effort to update the material -- and the movies most dialogue-heavy scene -- is a protracted country club engagement party for lesbian couple Maureen (Idina Menzel) and Joanne (Tracie Thoms) seemingly designed to mine the gay-marriage debate for contempo relevance. Forays into an AIDS support group attended by Tom Collins (Jesse L. Martin) and his drag queen lover Angel (Wilson Jermaine Heredia) have a pallid seen-it-before feel and the film only acquires emotional weight when death touches the band of friends directly late in the action. While aspiring filmmaker Mark (Anthony Rapp) remains the storys designated guide shooting events for his 16mm documentary the character lacks dimension here leaving the film rudderless. Too often Columbus adheres to a familiar music-video idiom When stymied songwriter Roger (Adam Pascal) recaps his brief blazing success and doomed love in ""One Song Glory"" the scene seems like recycled Aerosmith; the same characters escape to New Mexico in ""What You Own"" appears to have been lifted from the Bon Jovi 80s vaults. Perhaps the most successful efforts to breathe new visual life into the numbers come in ""Tango Maureen"" which shifts into a fantasy of formation tango dancers on a marble-floored subway station; and half of ""Out Tonight"" in which heroin-addicted gogo-dancer Mimi (Rosario Dawson) does some steamy bump-and-grinding in micro-shorts in a sleaze bar abandoned too early for yet more exuberant running through the streets. While the decision to enlist most of the shows original cast (Rapp Pascal Martin Heredia Menzel and Taye Diggs all created their characters on stage) will please diehard Rentheads it raises awkward questions as to why these people some of them clearly pushing 40 are still floundering in artsy aimlessness. While theres a general charisma shortage the actors all do OK with Dawson Thoms and Martin finding more emotional nuances than most. But Columbus and Chbosky have not succeeded in making them vivid figures for anyone not already invested in the characters through prior familiarity. On the tech side Howard Cummings production design trowels on the gritty texture and costumer Aggie Guerard Rodgers outfits the cast in thrift-store boho chic; Stephen Goldblatts widescreen lensing is disappointingly tame and undynamic for a musical often blighted by poor composition.
