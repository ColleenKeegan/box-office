The utterly absurd plot revolves around the naughty antics of some stereotypical teens stranded by a blizzard at a US airport on Christmas Eve. Confined to an Unaccompanied Minors room the bored kids break out and proceed to drive the airports socially inept passenger relations manager and his bumbling security guards round the twist by stealing airport buggies breaking into storage rooms tampering with suitcases and ordering expensive food they cant pay for before finally performing a good festive deed as if theyd planned it all along. Yeah sure.This Home Alone-style kids vs adults scenario is meant to play as lighthearted anarchic comedy. Were supposed to sympathise with the poor little blighters and think of them as kids just having a bit of fun rather like dysfunctional parents might do on hearing their son had just destroyed the local bus shelter. Irresponsible content notwithstanding its the low standard of filmmaking that really defies belief which is why I havent given it any stars at all.

Pictures and Village Roadshow Pictures comedy Unaccompanied Minors distributed by Warner Bros. ... more Photo John Bramley Beware of unaccompanied bags -- and kids 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Unaccompanied Minors Family comedy. Starring Dyllan Christopher Gina Mantegna Quinn Shephard Tyler James Williams and Brett Kelly. Directed by Paul Feig. (PG. 89 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Like a hastily packed suitcase ""Unaccompanied Minors"" buries the one essential item for a successful comedy beneath layers of implausible situations distinctly unfunny slapstick and stale jokes including one about flatulence that reeks of desperation. The buried ingredient is an emotional connection to this scattershot story of kids stranded at an airport on Christmas. A human factor is there but barely mined. These adolescents are from broken homes and are traveling by themselves to visit the parent they dont regularly live with. The screenwriters take a subject that millions of families could relate to and sporadically allude to it between stupid shtick. Theres a touching scene toward the end where you see what ""Unaccompanied Minors"" might have been. A gang of unruly children wreak havoc with a terminal and luggage loading dock. A rigid airport official commends the packs leader Spencer (Dyllan Christopher) on his ingenuity and jokingly asks whether he trained with the Navy Seals. Spencers reply -- that kids from divorced families are naturally more resourceful -- is one of few genuine moments in a ridiculously contrived movie. A monster snowstorm brings together a half-dozen youngsters each representing a Hollywood cliche of childhood. Theres the snooty rich girl (Gina Mantegna Joe Mantegnas daughter) the trailer trash tomboy (Quinn Shephard) the fat kid (Brett Kelly) who is always embarrassing himself and the smarty-pants Charlie (Tyler James Williams). Since Spencers parents split hes become the man of the house responsible for his beyond adorable younger sister. His promise that Santa would deliver her present by a specified time results in him and his new friends escaping from a holding room within the bowels of the airport stealing canoes from the unclaimed baggage room and paddling down snow-covered hills to a hotel where the little girl is staying. Given the limits of their roles the young actors acquit themselves well enough particularly Williams (star of the sitcom ""Everybody Hates Chris"") as the multitalented Charlie who upon finding a top hat and cane among the unclaimed items breaks into an irresistible soft shoe. Its easy for Spencer and Charlie and their cohorts to appear smart since the adults are painted as idiots. Security guards meant to be monitoring the kids engage in a game of musical chairs instead in which they neglect to remove one of the seats. Flight attendants leave Spencers sister with a child a few years older while they go off to snare a pilot. Filmmaker Paul Feig has proven his creativity directing ""The Office"" and ""Freaks and Geeks"" (which he created). With ""Unaccompanied Minors"" he piles on one unfunny gag after another leaving little room for character development. A half-baked script by Jacob Meszaros and Mya Stark admittedly gives Feig little to work with. But his young cast is capable of a lot more than is required of them in this so-called comedy. -- Advisory Mild language and offensive humor.

"Minors gets away with more than it should - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Minors gets away with more than it should By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  December 8 2006 Pseudo-anarchist tweens are bound to love ""Unaccompanied Minors"" a clumsily made but disarming enough movie about the joys of getting away with everything.Just in time for the holiday hundreds of kids traveling solo are stranded at a fictional Chicago airport after a blizzard. Apparently theres an entire travel subculture of underage frequent fliers and ""Unaccompanied Minors"" is a cartoon expose. The movie concocts various obstacle courses for its five types -- Tyler James Williams (the adorable buppie nerd) Dyllan Christopher (the cute all-purpose nerd) Gina Mantegna (the rich hottie) Quinn Shephard (the tomboy) and Brett Kelly (the oaf) -- to escape the airport-security nincompoops.In the process the film crashes the slapstick of ""Home Alone"" into the youthful angst of ""The Breakfast Club."" Here the kids raid the goodies in the vast unclaimed baggage room and sass the head of security -- played by the acerbic comedian Lewis Black of all people -- because thats just what joint custody will do to a kid. A broken home has its advantages. As someone in this movie explains ""Divorced kids are more resourceful than others.""Their resourcefulness occasions frolic. Presumably theres a big audience for sequences like an early one in which the tomboy commandeers an electric cart to plow through a crowded terminal. Whenever possible unruliness is rewarded. Written by Jacob Meszaros and Mya Stark the movie makes Black out to be the bad guy even though at every turn hes never less than right -- he even corrects bad grammar -- and the kids are feloniously wrong. But since he hates Christmas hes the villain -- and bad at his job.The lackadaisical security qualifies the movie as a nostalgia piece. So does the inexplicable appearance of comic talents such as Teri Garr and three members of the Kids in the Hall. Also aboard as thankless ornaments on this plastic Christmas tree are Jessica Walter B.J. Novak and Wilmer Valderrama  whos reduced to a kid-pleasing ""Ay carumba"" In addition to Black who gets to do some characteristic ranting (I shudder to think about the spittle that surely hit this young cast) the film wastes other ""Daily Show"" associates like Rob Riggle and ex-correspondent Rob Corddry  although Corddry does have a few funny moments playing an eco-minded dad reduced to dashing through the snow in a Hummer to pick up his stranded kids.Presumably a lot of these adults are pals with the films director Paul Feig who has written for or directed episodes of the stellar sitcoms on which a few of them have appeared (""Freaks and Geeks"" ""Arrested Development"" ""The Office"" ) and some of the authentic warmth in those shows creeps into ""Unaccompanied Minors"" which gets better as it plods along. The young stars settle into their roles. Or rather The kids senses of entitlement become less irritating especially Williams whos the magnetic star of ""Everybody Hates Chris.""Eventually a surprising kind of matter-of-factness emerges albeit in crude ways like the one flatulence joke that while played as a gag achieves a certain identifiable realism Hey it happens. I never stopped rooting for Black to catch these punks. But I did stop caring that the movie is rigged for him to fail.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (Unaccompanied Minors John Bramley) C+ Unaccompanied Minors Genre Drama Comedy; Starring Dyllan Christopher Wilmer Valderrama Lewis Black Dominique Saldana Tyler James Williams; Director Paul Feig; Author Paul Feig; Release Date Wide 12/08/2006; Runtime (in minutes) 89; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted December 6 2006 -- 1200 AM EST Many unaccompanied grown-ups are probably psyched to go see the kiddie-league comedy Unaccompanied Minors. Its director Paul Feig was the head mind behind TVs cult classic Freaks and Geeks the wise and wholly mature evocation of painful high-schooldom. Feig has the capacity to work well with children while also speaking directly to adults -- which is why the strictly-for-kids Minors feels like a botch. During Christmas week six preteens from Breakfast Club walks of life get stranded in a snowed-in Midwestern airport and the movie quickly establishes itself as precisely the poorly done kind of Hollywood fantasy where almost every adult in the building promptly falls asleep in the waiting areas as if this were a zombie film. Practically the only one still vertical enough to chase the scamps around is the airport honcho played by The Daily Shows Lewis Black who was not meant to deliver his usual apoplexy to children. He is not that funny; nor are any of the movies many cameo performers (including a few players from The Office and Arrested Development); nor is the film as a whole. When near the end Rob Corddry gets an out-of-nowhere chuckle by goofing on the ""down-low"" nature of a high five from the little girl playing his kid it registers more like a shock than a laugh. Feig does wring out a few fleeting fun/heartfelt moments from the minors and the movies Christmas treacle is smoother than Santa Clause 3s. But anyone old enough to go see this without a parent or guardian will have seen it all before.

Fast-paced slickly handled kidpic probably wont create a stampede to the box office amid heavy Yuletide competition. But its a crowdpleaser -- at least for crowds aged about 6 to 12 -- that should translate into modest theatrical returns before lucrative future seasons of annual rental and broadcast cheer. Kids run amuck while stranded on Christmas Eve at a snowed-in airport in the comedy ""Unaccompanied Minors."" Fast-paced slickly handled kidpic probably wont create a stampede to the box office amid heavy Yuletide competition. But its a crowdpleaser -- at least for crowds aged about 6 to 12 -- that should translate into modest theatrical returns before lucrative future seasons of annual rental and broadcast cheer. A busy midwestern airport (pic was shot in Utah) is the layover point for a holiday season-full of travelers including kids going solo with most being passed from one divorced parent to another. Among them are a barely adolescent quintet first introduced on various department store Santas laps Dorky but cute Spencer (Dyllan Christopher) towing his crybaby little sis Katy (Dominique Saldana); princessy rich girl Grace (Gina Mantegna); Donna (Quinn Shephard) a tomboy with anger-management issues; brainiac Charlie (Tyler James Williams); and massive ""Beef"" (Brett Kelly) who communicates primarily with his Aquaman action figure. When weather conditions cancel all flights no one is more upset than passenger relations chief Mr. Porter (Lewis Black) who was greatly looking forward to a Hawaiian vacation rather than working his 15th Christmas in a row. Unaccompanied minors are shepherded into a cavernous basement room where with unlucky Zach (Wilmer Valderrama) the sole staffer assigned to mind them they fast create conditions akin to a prison riot. Cycles of escape recapture and punishment ensue though a climactic infusion of Christmas spirit helps keep results merry. Theres little here that will interest most grownups or teens but ""Unaccompanied Minors"" generally avoids the crassness of so many recent family pics as well as excess mawkishness. (Theres a little of the latter in the last lap pointing an accusatory finger at divorced or uncaring parents but scenarists and helmer refrain from laying it on too thick.) Though dialogue is routine situations are colorful enough product placements not too over-the-top (aggressively plugged The Sharper Image aside) and the ultimate community-minded message transcends the usual orgies of slapstick destruction and gift acquisition that too many contempo live-action kidpics seem to primarily support. Juve leads are affable with Williams (star of ""Everybody Loves Chris"") getting a couple standout moments especially when he demonstrates precocious dancing chops. Black doesnt do anything special with his Scrooge-y part while Valderrama is stuck in an innocuous straight-man role. Faring better are ""Saturday Night Lives"" Rob Riggle and three Kids in the Hall (Kevin McDonald Bruce McCulloch Mark McKinney) as blundering security guards. Teri Garr and Jessica Walter have small parts; Rob Corddry has an entertaining larger one as Spencer and Katys dad who braves the blizzard in his bio-diesel car to rescue them from airport purgatory. Widescreen lensing and design contribs have a bright polished look; Michael Andrews original score and a neat soundtrack selection of old and new holiday tunes are also plusses. While this may not be the hippest assignment for helmer Paul Feig known largely for his TV work he does an expert job with unremarkable material that suggests more bigscreen assignments should be forthcoming.
