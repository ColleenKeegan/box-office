Science and religion collide commingle and eventually reach a state of peaceful coexistence in ""Angels amp; Demons"" a follow-up to ""The Da Vinci Code"" in which director Ron Howard conspicuously gives top priority to the storys beat-the-clock thriller elements. Less turgid and aggravating than its predecessor this cleverly produced melodrama remains hamstrung by novelists Dan Browns laborious connect-the-dots plotting and the filmmakers prosaic literal-mindedness in the face of ripe historical antagonisms mystery and intrigue. Although unlikely to match the 750 million-plus worldwide haul of the same teams much-maligned 2006 ""Da Vinci"" sensation this adaptation of a lesser-known Brown book will nonetheless make an unholy amount of money. Although ""Angels amp; Demons"" was the first novel to feature Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon the film version is sensibly positioned as a sequel to ""Da Vinci"" in an early scene in which a Vatican emissary requests the professors help in spite of the existing bad blood. This sequence takes place at a Cambridge swimming pool enabling it to exhibit Langdon (Tom Hanks) in much fitter condition than he appeared three years ago. Hes also clearly changed hairdressers a good move. With the last pope dead and the college of cardinals gathered in conclave to elect a new church leader Rome enters hyper-crisis mode when four eminent cardinals are kidnapped with the announcement that one will be killed each hour leading up to a bombing that will destroy the Vatican. The culprit apparently is the Illuminati a secret society with roots in the Enlightenment that is now bent on avenging the churchs violent attacks against it more than 200 years ago. Zipped over to Rome with less than 24 hours to piece together arcane clues as to the clerics whereabouts Langdon is this time asked to put his talents in service of the Catholic Church not to dismember it as in ""Da Vinci."" Filmmakers are currently getting lots of mileage out of how they were prevented from filming at numerous church-controlled locations in Rome just as Catholic orgs continue to denounce the picture sight unseen -- the irony being that this story takes the side of the church against those who would destroy it. In the company of Italian scientist Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer) who works for the CERN particle physics lab that produced the canister of antimatter that threatens to blow St. Peters to kingdom come Langdon dashes from church to crypt to nave to catacomb finding freshly killed cardinals and others about to be as he employs his unique expertise to hash out the Illuminatis insidious plan. Perhaps recognizing how static and talky ""Da Vinci"" was Howard and lenser Salvatore Totino this time have the camera thrashing and thrusting about while keeping Langdon constantly on the move and laying Hans Zimmers thumping score on top. While more superficially stimulating the adrenalized approach cant hide the utter absurdity of a timeframe that gives the characters just an hour each time to navigate the labyrinths of the Vatican basement archives figure out what to do next and make their way through crowds and Roman traffic to the location of the next atrocity. While the minutes tick away everyone in the inner circle of Vatican power comes under suspicion of being a possible infiltrator including the late popes most trusted aide and now Camerlengo the caretaker of church business in between papal tenures (Ewan McGregor); cagey old Cardinal Strauss (Armin Mueller-Stahl) whos presiding over the papal election; and the belligerent Commander Richter (Stellan Skarsgard) head of the Swiss Guard. Browns straight-line plotting streamlined by scenarists David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman creates some impatience and a hunger for any kind of surprise. The latter is satisfied to an extent by the climax which however far-fetched is visually spectacular and dramatically both evenhanded and unexpected. Hanks is kept in motion so much theres hardly time for characterization as such; its enough that the borderline risible aspects of his character in ""Da Vinci"" have been eliminated. Zurer takes a while to make an impression but a thoughtful intelligence finally breaks through to favorable effect. McGregor -- like Hanks looking better than he has in his last couple of films -- is OK as the custodian of church power during the traumatic transition and Mueller-Stahl keeps his characters hand hidden like an ace poker player. If as reported the production shot in Rome for only two weeks it sure doesnt show; pic is saturated with local atmosphere evidently achieved through expert location lensing combined with wizardly sleight-of-hand in the visual effects and production design especially in the climactic section set in St. Peters Square. Dark exterior scenes accurately reflect the low lighting levels of much of nocturnal Rome.

I remember two things. One is Jean Renos surprising show of feeling when his character the weaselly French police inspector learned he had been betrayed. For a brief shining moment all the plot mechanics mattered in human terms. The other is the grim tight-lipped face of Tom Hanks a very fine actor and a bona fide movie star struggling to humanize the role of Harvard symbologist and eternal gasbag Robert Langdon as he cracked the riddle of the great-great-great-greatgreatgreat-granddaughter begotten  by Christianitys favorite son. Some secrets are destined to find the light. The origins of the professors academia-mullet ""Da Vinci Code"" haircut meanwhile remain a mystery. That haircut is gone in ""Angels amp; Demons"" director Ron Howards second film adaptation of a Dan Brown best seller but three years later the major players are back for more grandiloquent hackery. Hanks returns to the dullest role of his career under the direction of Howard who takes the material as seriously as a kidney stone on the way out. Cinematographer Salvatore Totino again adds heaps of holy light and unholy shadow. Composer Hans Zimmer fulminates like a maniac whipping up music that would be considered too much for ""The Omen"" and ""Armageddon"" put together. The frenzied choirs wail the kettle drums pound and the skulkers and schemers lurk in the Vatican awaiting selection of a new pope. Members of the secret Illuminati brotherhood have stolen a canister of explosive antimatter from a Geneva particle physics facility leaving a murdered scientist behind. Somewhere in Vatican City four cardinals have been kidnapped and theyre to be killed one per hour. The antimatters scheduled to go blooey all over Vatican City thus representing a triumph of Illuminati over the Catholics (old grudge match there; long story) and Langdon must locate the secret Path of Illumination and protect the lives of millions. ""Da Vinci"" was a 758 million global hit. I have yet to run into anyone who really liked it. How could the follow-up be the same sort of lumbering mediocrity? These people are professionals Astonishingly ""Angels amp; Demons"" is the same sort of lumbering mediocrity. Its more violent than ""Da Vinci"" which is something I guess and its narrative structure ensures a regular string of cliffhangers. But what turns the pages in print (or on a Kindle) doesnt necessarily propel a story onscreen. Once again Hanks has nothing to play except generic concern as he and his latest comely but sexual-tension-free partner in sleuthing (an Italian particle physicist played by Ayelet Zurer) run around Rome hunting for bloodthirsty members of the Illuminati. Nobody goes to movies like this for the dialogue but still ""Its a passageway that leads to the Vatican"" Then bam Langdon enters a new church and again stops dead for more background on whatever the hell is helping him play this game of ""Wheres Cardinal?"" Hanks does what he can to add a little spice to lines such as ""The chapel is Raphael ... but the statues are Bernini."" Howard goes at ""Angels amp; Demons"" impersonally which is depressing because in his better movies--""Apollo 13"" or ""Frost/Nixon""--he knows his populism and sells it respectably. The cast cannot be faulted even if Hanks seems at odds with such a robotically functional leading role. The supporting ranks include Ewan McGregor as the late pontiffs favorite acolyte Stellan Skarsgard as the seething Swiss Guard security chief and Armin Mueller-Stahl who plays a cardinal craftily right down the middle so that we wonder if hes a good cardinal or a bad cardinal. Even so watching ""Angels amp; Demons"" is like being waterboarded by exposition. At one point Hanks can be glimpsed gasping for air mid-endless-sentence. Has there ever been a flatter movie character played by a more innately likable star? MPAA rating PG-13 (for sequences of violence disturbing images and thematic material)Running time 215. Opens Friday.Starring Tom Hanks (Robert Langdon); Ewan McGregor (Camerlengo); Ayelet Zurer (Vittoria Vetra); Stellan Skarsgard (Commander Richter); Pierfrancesco Favino (Inspector Olivetti); Nikolaj Lie Kaas (Assassin); Armin Mueller-Stahl (Cardinal Strauss) Directed by Ron Howard; written by David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman based on the novel by Dan Brown; produced by Brian Grazer Howard and John Calley. A Columbia Pictures release. Posted at 053000 AM Comments I actually liked this movie. tom hanks is really annoying though. I found myself on the edge of my seat more than once. did not see that ending coming. Posted by LRS | June 06 2009 at 1225 AM Beyond idiotic. Hankss character (the hero) was arrogant obnoxious and stupid hard to watch and harder to listen to. Tom I know the money is good but we all know that you and Rita dont need the money what with Greek Wedding and Mamma Mia and everything else you two are involved in. Next time pick a good script with a likeable character. And try acting again. You cant be happy with this mess can you? Posted by Patrick | May 29 2009 at 0912 PM One of the worst movies ever made. It made me laugh. Without meaning to. No matter how anyone here tries to rehash it it seems the Vatican was right. The movie is harmless. More than harmless. There are not words to describe how pointless it became. It couldnt influence the smallest child. The only possible reason I can see for the few good reviews that appeared is that some people are desperate to like this film. Because its Dan Brown. Its just GOT to be good. If this is the best pop culture can summon up against Catholicism its time to re-evalute. Come out of your holes people. Because this is truly pathetic. Stop embarassing yourselves. Posted by Aaron Banks | May 20 2009 at 0631 PM Before too many cafe philosophers poo-poo the critics for resoundingly and deservedly trouncing Angels amp; Demons please look at this films stellar story. A nefarious sect persecuted long ago seeks long awaited vengeance against a religious faction currently in power. Sound familiar? Its the recent Star Wars trilogy They even cast Ewan Obi-Wan McGregor as a member of the Jedi High Council or Vatican if you prefer. So fun popcorn flick? If you are the sort who thinks ground chuck is a feast yes. Great story? Unless by great story you mean plagiarized...no. Its the Phantom Menace without Jar Jar. I think I will pass thanks. Posted by Techtite | May 15 2009 at 0144 PM I think you should get another job Michael. I dont know who you talk to but I loved the movie Da Vinci Code. All my friends did too. I dont follow your critics on movies. Your always wrong I dont know why the Tribune puts up with you and your soooo wrong comments on great movies. Their entertainment not real life Posted by April Gonzalez | May 15 2009 at 1155 AM The Da Vinci Code was one of the worst books I have ever read. Poorly written plot full of holes etc. Not sure how it became so highly rated - movie was probably just as lousy so I wouldnt expect this one to be any good. People seem to be just getting sucked by the hype. Posted by jessie | May 15 2009 at 1145 AM Tom Hanks is the most over rated actor ever. He couldnt deliver a pizza let alone a line. And Dopie Ron Howard is nothing but a lefty hack of a director. Its no wonder that they could only produce feces. Posted by TQM | May 15 2009 at 0901 AM I work in a bookstore...almost everyone loved Angels and Demons even more than the DaVinci code. The Catholic Church is upset with it...they seemingly dont know what a book on fiction really is. Posted by mzmarlena | May 14 2009 at 1013 PM To the forum member who said that the Angels and Demons are confused - we dont know which is which...THAT is the point. (roll eyes) This movie is entertainment - if you are bothered by assaults against your religion dont go. Help the protesters at Notre Dame and show the world that you never learned the most important message of your Lord - tolerance. Plus your absence will make it easier for me to get a seat when the show sels out again and again. Posted by MoralCompass | May 14 2009 at 0821 PM Read both books. Bad grammar through out bad editing just bad bad bad. Posted by paul | May 14 2009 at 0809 PM Angels and Demons was a terrible book (the indestructible tweed jacket drove me nuts) so it doesnt surprise me that the movie sucks too. Posted by Jim | May 14 2009 at 0512 PM If youre looking for tension/chemistry for Hanks then they just need to cast Ryan as his female opposite. Every movie theyve done together has sparks. Posted by Mich | May 14 2009 at 0233 PM The biggest problem with the movie (apart from the scientific errors in the ""plot"" - destroying Vatican City with anti-matter? Get real it would be faster and cheaper to build a space station and drop an asteroid on it. Let he who is without sin cast the first stone and all that.) is that theyre confusing who the angels and demons are. Face it this is just another ""learning is EVIL"" movie. Posted by Alverant | May 14 2009 at 0226 PM (Spoiler Alert). At the end of the movie Tom Hanks stares up at the moon lets out a big sigh and says ""I wonder who the next person to step on the moon will be?"" to which his co-star replies ""Come again??"" Posted by jac holtzman | May 14 2009 at 1249 PM The Davinci Code was one of the worst movies of all time IMHO and people mostly saw it because they had read the book which was a lot more fun. You really couldnt pay me enough to see the sequel. Posted by Adam | May 14 2009 at 1237 PM There is an old adage those that can do. Those that cant teach about it. The new addition is those who cant do either become critics. I suggest you and your fellow esteemed critics get a real job and perhaps then contribute something of value to society. Posted by Uncle Lar | May 14 2009 at 1150 AM I agree with you completely. I found the Da Vinci Code (movie) to be overrated and boring as hell Im not even going to bother wasting my money on this new p.o.s. Posted by Lisa | May 14 2009 at 1137 AM Theres a number of reasons why the Da Vinci Code made so much money but its certainly not because theres something good about it. It was an adventure movie that lacked adventure a clever plot without cleverness lining up dull unsympathetic characters to exchange the latest gossip on religious sensationalism. Well see how this one which looks almost equally bad will perform with the one consolation that we wont have to suffer that terrible French actress again. Posted by retrogaming | May 14 2009 at 1132 AM Richard of Miamis Illuminati bulb must have burned out. The definition of a day is the earth rotating one full revolution on its axis. ""Even if the definition of a day (which is a revolution around the Sun which wasnt still created) "" is the definition of a year. Posted by Mike | May 14 2009 at 1125 AM Da Vinci Code was a ""cant put this book down"" kind of summer read. I remember the movie as being OK. Angels and Demons struck me as the rough draft for Da Vinci Code and a real bad one. I didnt bother to finish it. After one other awful Dan Brown book I figured out he is a one hit wonder that some how manages to keep in print. Posted by MarkC | May 14 2009 at 1100 AM I liked The DaVinci Code a lot. Didnt get around to reading the book so maybe that helped. Nay it did help. As a heavy reader its come to my awareness that few books transfer to the screen in a fashion that is going to please the majority of readers. Posted by The Tom | May 14 2009 at 1032 AM rEAD A BOOK AND FORGET THE MOVIE. YOUR MIND WILL ALWAYS SEE A PERFECT PICTURE OF YOUR REALITY Posted by NorthSideTaxPayer | May 14 2009 at 1032 AM Coming soon to a theatre near you Hacks amp; Flacks. Can Robert Langdon solve the greatest mystery of all before it destroys Hollywood and perhaps all of southern California? See him try to figure out the esoteric symbols that used to be Tom Hanks judgment and project-selection skills before it all goes Bang. Posted by Christopher | May 14 2009 at 1019 AM svengolly is whats politely termed a ""less demanding viewer."" Some of us expect more when we plunk down the dollars. Your favorable opinion of the first movie wasnt shared by most moviegoers. A big box office gross is no indicator of quality nor is a small one. Posted by Rhonda | May 14 2009 at 1019 AM The Da Vinci Code watered down the female lead and overall was painful to watch even though I liked the book. I believe I will wait on Angels amp; Demons until it comes out on cable. I had hoped they would have learned from the first movie.

By David Denby Share Tweet Table of Contents Tom Hanks and Ayelet Zurer in Ron Howards new adaptation of a Dan Brown novel. Credit Illustration by Tom Bachtell ""The Da Vinci Code""--both the 2003 novel and the 2006 movie--mesmerized audiences with puzzles and bloody horrors while purporting to edify them with talk of religion and art history. Yet one element in the movie broke through the pretense--the sight of an actor having a good time. Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teabing an expert on the Holy Grail wriggled his thick eyebrows and let out his mighty baritone in torrents of expository fervor. Like Laurence Olivier shouting in merriment forty years ago in ""The Shoes of the Fisherman"" McKellen was signalling to us that the material was rot. Sir Leigh explained that an extraordinary secret about Jesus had been hushed up for millennia and that if it were to be exposed the authority of the Roman Catholic Church would collapse. McKellen may have been playing for laughs but the director Ron Howard and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman adapting Dan Browns world-conquering best-seller (forty million copies sold by 2006 eighty million by now) were not. They illustrated Sir Leighs lecture with a sombre slide show of devotions persecutions and slaughters. The movie quivered with expectation. As the entire world now knows however ""the greatest secret in modern history"" turned out to be an old yarn Jesus a fleshly man married Mary Magdalene who was not a prostitute but one of the disciples and she bore him a child. Sir Leigh concluded with a zinger at the Council of Nicea in 325 the Church fathers created a false pure Jesus and consolidated their power as a caste of male celibates--the priesthood and the hierarchy--by systematically downgrading women. In ""Angels amp; Demons"" a companion to ""The Da Vinci Code"" no one has as much fun as McKellen but I kept thinking of him because Sir Leighs lecture so clearly illustrates Dan Browns opportunism. As one pondered whether the charges were true or false one couldnt help noticing that Brown having set himself up as a celebrant of marital pleasure with the Magdalene story had created a hero Dr. Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) a professor of ""symbology"" at Harvard who is a chaste and lonely man--a kind of secular priest. I doubt that Brown was being ironic. He threw Langdon into internecine Church wars turning him into a detective with special skills as a reader of arcane inscriptions and codes. My guess is that he couldnt resist stealing Sherlock Holmes--literatures most popular eunuch--as a character type. Brown drew on the mystique of male chastity even as he was ostensibly overthrowing it. Brown published ""Angels amp; Demons"" in 2000 three years before ""The Da Vinci Code."" But the two books are of a piece and the same team behind the first movie--Ron Howard and Akiva Goldsman--made the new one (joined this time by the screenwriter David Koepp). If youve got a successful racket going dont change it. Theres the reliable mumbo jumbo of secret societies insignias codes tombs uncanny inscriptions. There is fire and torment and unspeakable practices dwelled upon at length. And there are puzzles and potted bits of art history bristling with unexpected interest. It seems that great paintings and statues play a leading role in ancient conspiracies. Da Vinci knew Vatican secrets; so did Raphael. (Brown doesnt bother with minor artists.) At times the material isnt all that different from the buttered-popcorn thrills of the recent ""Mummy"" movies starring the beefy Brendan Fraser. But Brown and now Ron Howard have added an incendiary element to trash--open hostility toward the Catholic Church. The excitable William Donohue of the Catholic League may be predictable in his indignation about ""Angels amp; Demons"" but he isnt necessarily wrong. The books and the movies turn Church ritual and mystery into a creep show. ""Code"" had an albino in a cassock who regularly flogged himself in front of a crucifix and a dying man writing long-winded coded messages in his own blood. ""Angels amp; Demons"" has fanatics searing inscriptions into the flesh of their enemies with a branding iron. No doubt the Church could show more contrition for its many sins but it may not deserve Brown and Howard who seem to have a thing about gaudy displays of sadism and self-mutilation--a taste for gothic exploitation that sells well all over the world. The international box-office gross for ""The Da Vinci Code"" was three-quarters of a billion dollars. Dan Brown is just mad for cabals. (Right now he is probably writing a novel revealing how Skull amp; Bones orchestrated the trouble in the Swat Valley in order to vindicate the Bush Administration and sweep Jeb into power.) One of the secret societies in ""Code"" was the Priory of Sion which had allegedly been in operation for a thousand years protecting Jesus bloodline as it passed down through Merovingian kings and other descendants. In fact the Priory of Sion was a hoax created in the nineteen-fifties by a Frenchman who wanted to ascend to a French throne that no longer existed. The new movie presents another sect the Illuminati a group of freethinking geniuses including Galileo and Bernini who through the ages have fought the Churchs antipathy to science and have in turn been persecuted. Its probably pointless to note that the actual Illuminati got started in Bavaria not Rome and a hundred years later than the movie says and that groups within the Church especially the Jesuits have at times encouraged scientific research more vigorously than the current Republican Party. Theres no way to fight this stuff. Furiously busy the Illuminati steal some antimatter generated by the accelerator at CERN the particle-physics site on the Swiss-French border and plant it in the Vatican. The Church again is on the verge of destruction--not just physically but in its essence. If antimatter is as scientists in the movie believe the source of life then what is Gods role in creation? The Illuminati have also kidnapped four cardinals and are killing them in freaky ways one at a time at important art-historical sites. While all this is going on the other cardinals are meeting in solemn conclave. The Pope has died and they have to choose a new man. Are the Illuminati trying to put one of their own in the papacy? The Higher Questions are delicately sprinkled throughout the clerical bloodbath and an endless chase. Langdon and an Italian scientist from CERN Dr. Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer) bounce all over Rome and the movie turns into a treasure hunt of sorts with for example the spear in Berninis ""Ecstasy of St. Teresa"" in one church pointing toward his fountain in the Piazza Navona where a cardinal is about to be drowned. The Church miffed by ""The Da Vinci Code"" refused Howard access to the Vatican for ""Angels amp; Demons"" so he re-created St. Peters Square in the parking lot of the Hollywood Park racetrack. The sets are convincing but why has Ron Howard who made the impressively accurate ""Apollo 13"" fallen among frauds and daft dreamers? Apart from conspiracy theorists who really believes in hokum like Dan Browns? Gullibility and pockets of anti-Catholic feeling are too simple as explanations for the worldwide appeal of ""The Da Vinci Code."" Something more complicated is going on in which precisely not believing--the enjoyment of humbug the crazier the better--is part of the turn-on. If these movies made any damned sense the public response might be no more than a yawn. The French writer-director Olivier Assayas has recently made nasty erotic thrillers (""Demonlover"" and ""Boarding Gate"") about the impersonal brutality of global capitalism. But in the new ""Summer Hours"" he is working in a calmer and more lyrical style. Reaching back to humanist masters like Renoir he brings the global economy to bear on the fate of a bourgeois French family. A woman in her seventies (Edith Scob) the niece and possibly the lover of a deceased French painter dies at her home outside Paris and her three grown children who were brought up there have to decide what to do with the house the Art Nouveau furniture and the paintings by Corot and other artists that they lived with. Of the three only the eldest (Charles Berling) an economics professor in Paris wants to keep the place; his brother (Jeremie Renier) lives in Shanghai where he runs a sneaker factory and his careless and harried sister (Juliette Binoche) a designer in New York is rapidly becoming Americanized. It doesnt take us long to realize that the house is France itself--cultivated beautiful but no longer central in the global era. The movie takes a ruminative turn. What will happen if the house is sold the collection given to the Musee dOrsay the memories dissipated? Its a tragedy but how big a tragedy? What happens to art when it passes from private worship to public scrutiny? In the end Assayas shooting the film with relaxed flowing camera movements gives his love not to beautiful objects but to the disorderly life out of which art is made.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor May 15 2009 Save for later Saved Here we go again. The last time a literary escapade by Dan Brown made it to the screen the result was a big bore and big box office hit. ""The Da Vinci Code"" was exactly the kind of book that in a saner world would not have been adapted for the screen in the first place and not because of its supposed heresies either. Virtually all of its clues were based on verbal or visual diagrams most of them abstruse - not exactly the stuff of cinema. It was a bit like trying to make an action-packed summer movie with the board game Scrabble at its center.But I repeat the film made money some 217.5 million and so now we have what by all rights should be a prequel but instead is a kind of sequel to ""The Da Vinci Code."" The novel ""Angels and Demons"" preceded ""The Da Vinci Code"" and was the first to feature Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks). In the new movie hes entangled once again with the Roman Catholic Church hierarachy who despite some residual ill will from their last go-round seek his help in thwarting a plot against the Vatican engineered by the Illuminati a secret society going back to the Enlightenment that has kidnapped four prominent cardinals and plans to blow up the Vatican - all in retribution for violent attacks against its members going back hundreds of years. (Galileo according to Brown was an Illuminati.)The biggest improvement in ""Angels and Demons"" over its predecessor is tonsorial. In ""The Da Vinci Code"" Hanks sported a scraggly ponytail or whatever you want to call it. Why would he make himself look so ridiculous? To me this was a riddle far more inexplicable than any of the arcane religious symbology on display. Its not like Robert is a swinger. Hes pretty grim and not in the camp/facetious way that say Harrison Fords Indiana Jones is. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? In ""Angels and Demons"" Robert has normal hair though hes still grim. Hes paired with a fetching Italian physicist (Ayelet Zurer) but shes pretty grim too. They make quite a long-faced pair which is no fun at all. Director Ron Howard who also made ""The Da Vinci Code"" throws in a lot more running and jumping and chasing this time around but he also carries over from that film its dour tone. Was he afraid that audiences might doubt Roberts seriousness if he came across as a bit of a scamp? Despite its serioso trappings ""Angels and Demons"" is pure pulp. Trying to pretend otherwise is silly. And Hanks who could have been charmingly roguish in the role is once again reduced to a sodden somberness. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review Angels and Demons For its first half hour or so I was worried that ""Angels and Demons"" was going to be as talky and exposition-heavy as its predecessor. Characters are forever recapping plot points just in case the dimmest member of the audience didnt get them the first time. But then the plot exciting but absurd kicks in. With a new pope waiting to be elected Robert realizes he has 24 hours to rescue the cardinals who are being offed at the rate of one per hour and save the Vatican from some kind of antimatter God particle produced in the same CERN physics lab that employs his sidekick. Even with a Hans Zimmer score that seems to think its underscoring ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" on steroids and all too much dark-lit flesh rending its difficult not to get caught up in the high-toned tomfoolery of it all. Armin Mueller-Stahl with that muttery gravitas of his plays with wicked aplomb an ancient cardinal and Ewan McGregor is effective as a high-level church caretaker so full of pious rectitude that he seems instantly suspicious (to us if not to everyone else).It would have been fun if in his mad mission to save St. Peters Robert had been stymied by something as maddeningly mundane as Romes notorious traffic congestion. But wit is not Howards strong point. Hes most comfortable in the realm of derring-do. ""Angels and Demons"" is an OK action film but only the humorless will find it heretical - or educational.

""Angels amp; Demons"" is ""Roman Holiday"" on crank. Tom Hanks is back as symbol decoder Robert Langdon plucked out of Harvard by a Catholic Church rep who tells him essentially No hard feelings about the way you shredded our most cherished beliefs. Now can you please help save the Vatican from getting smithereened? A pope has died. With his assistant (Ewan McGregor) momentarily in charge as the cardinals meet in the Sistine Chapel to elect a new vicar of Christ a hidden bomb made of lethal ""antimatter"" is set to blow up the entire Vatican at midnight. Meanwhile each of the four leading candidates to be the next pope will be murdered one each hour according to the symbolism of the secret brotherhood of the ancient pro-science anti-church group the Illuminati whose membership is said to include Galileo and Bernini. Each murder will take place at a different point mapped out with symbols encoded in artwork and hidden in plain sight. I could go on with a few more yards from the Book of Exposition. ""Angels amp; Demons"" has some exciting sequences a spectacular ending with a terrific twist and a grounding in the debate about science versus religion that could hardly be more timely. Its got enough going on to sustain five blockbuster thrillers. That is its blessing and its curse. Like Dan Browns ""The Da Vinci Code"" his ""Angels amp; Demons"" (written first although the movie takes place afterward) was one of the greatest books youll ever watch offering 700 breathless pages and almost as many plot points and cheesy lines. Hurling everything he can into a furious two hours and a quarter though director Ron Howard rarely allows much to sink in. It takes a leap of dramatic faith not to giggle at the improbability of the climax or the ease with which Langdon solves centuries-old riddles. At times hes like the suspiciously bright student in the class who blurts out answers to questions before theyve been asked because he stole a copy of the test. Moreover key motives and back stories have been left out and theres no spark between the frustratingly chaste Langdon and the female lead (an Italian physicist who cooked up the dangerous antimatter played by Israels Ayelet Zurer). Howard remains vexed by the problem of how to translate puzzle-solving into visuals. Tom Hanks doesnt have time to be loose or funny -- to be Tom Hanks -- because hes buzzing like a Vespa at all times. ""Did-Raphael-Santi-ever-design a-chapel-with-an-ossuary-annex?"" he asks his mouth at warp drive. Howards best moments come when his characters shut up such as when his camera prowls around a church and finds a hideous statue thats half-angel and half-demon or in a tense scene in which Langdon must figure out how to break out of a rare-book library after the oxygen supply is cut off. But Howard glosses over the science versus religion debate at the heart of the book missing an opportunity to give the audience a reason to debate whether the villain had a valid point. Could the script have worked much better? Maybe not. The story cant be streamlined and the audience wont sit for five hours. The only option is to zoom over the Path of the Illuminati with the speed of a Maserati but the concentration of the Twitterati. St. Petes cheat sheet FORGET your Da Vinci decoders ""Angels amp; Demons"" offers a whole new thriller language so study up before you see it.  Camerlengo Though it sounds like a runny cheese its the papal assistant -- an Al Haig-like nobody who is technically in charge of the Vatican between the death of a pope and election of a new one.  Illuminati A centuries-old group dedicated to science that feels persecuted by the Church. (Galileo was reputedly a card-carrying member.)  Antimatter Like Mike Bloomberg its tiny but incredibly powerful. Stolen and hidden in Vatican City it may cause the most shocking explosion since Christian Bale went off on that crewman.  Ambigrams These cool graphics are the secret symbols of the Illuminati who have devised them for earth air fire and water.  Preferiti The four cardinals who are finalists to be the next pope. ANGELS amp; DEMONS Cram session. Running time 138 minutes. Rated PG-13 (action violence disturbing images).

Angels amp; Demons. (PG-13) Columbia (138 min.). Directed by Ron Howard. With Tom Hanks Ewan McGregor Ayelet Zurer. Now playing in New Jersey. TWO AND A HALF STARS. A great city is under siege. There have been politically motivated kidnappings gruesome terrorist threats. And now theres a literal ticking time bomb set to go off somewhere at midnight -- and only one man with the wits and the courage to find it. But this is not a new ""24."" Actually its more like ""XXIV."" Because all that action is at the center of ""Angels amp; Demons"" the new movie from Ron Howard Tom Hanks and author Dan Brown. And were once again in Brownland where no conspiracy can be too labyrinthine not to have the Catholic Church involved somewhere. Unlike their last production ""The Da Vinci Code"" which happily made hay out of heresy this one steers clear of Biblical revisions. Although there are plotters aplenty church dogma is pretty much left alone. The film shouldnt offend too many believers. That is as long as they dont believe in plausibility. The movie begins in Rome with the death of an aged pope -- then skips to Switzerland and the birth of a fat glass vial of anti-matter. But then the vial is stolen hidden and set to destroy all of Vatican City. Can heroic Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon stop it? Well have a little faith. Of course he can. But first of course he has to solve a series of puzzles left behind by the Illuminati an ancient secret society that seems to have a score to settle with the Holy See and a rather convoluted way of going about it. To be fair ""Angels and Demons"" is a truly handsome production seamlessly mixing real locations with beautifully detailed sets. There are a few good performances here and some thrills. Yet theres a flatness to the plotting. Four cardinals have disappeared the kidnappers declaring that they will murder one each hour. But that only pushes the film into a rut. Langdon decodes some hints and runs to where he thinks a clergyman is being held. Whoops too late. Time to figure out the next code Oh darn -- too late again. Hanks who has happily lost the hair-dont he sported in the last film is typically effortlessly believable -- a neat trick as Langdon is a fairly unbelievable character. And Ewan McGregor adds some intensity to things as the Camerlengo a Vatican official (and handily it turns out a skilled helicopter pilot). But Ayelet Zurer isnt particularly memorable as Vittoria Vetra a particle physicist. (In fact shes so forgettable that all I kept wondering was whether Brown had been thinking of Victoria Vetri the B-movie star of ""When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth."") And the veteran supporting cast only does what theyve done dozens of times before. Howard has some fun here and there -- he stages a sharp shoot-out and makes good scary use of a pair of boots. And the screenwriters seem to have their own private jokes having one dour cardinal echo lines from ""Tea and Sympathy"" of all things. But the thing about conspiracy movies is that however knotty they get they need to be neatly unraveled at the end. Once its all explained you need to think Of course. Why didnt I see that? In ""Angels amp; Demons"" though youre more likely to feel confused and only wonder how the villain could accomplish everything he did. (Plain truth He couldnt.) And if youve read ""The Da Vinci Code"" -- to which this was actually a prequel -- you may not even be too surprised. But give Howard credit -- in a summer when not too many of us will be jetting to Rome this film offers a cheap air-conditioned substitute. And give Brown a tip of the hat too. How many other thriller writers have a Harvard academic as their hero? Or build their best action scene around a bookcase? Ratings note The film contains gory violence.

In a Swiss lab two physicists isolate enough antimatter that it would matter -- explosively -- were it to fall into the wrong hands. ""Angels amp; Demons"" begins with solemnity but also popcorn promise. Then it opens its mouth so to speak proving the Dan Brown Code has yet to be cracked on film. Director Ron Howard and writers David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman have learned little from the errors of ""The Da Vinci Code"" the 2006 adaptation of Browns globally successful conspiracy yarn about the Catholic Church. ""Angels amp; Demons"" might just be the most expensive audiobook in history. A solid cinematic unfolding never happens. Yes there will be urgent dashes across and beneath the Rome of Bernini the sculptor and Galileo the father of modern science. Sure there will be dank moments in catacombs and passageways. Just as often they will be accompanied by characters nattering their knowledge of Catholic history and scientific mysteries like overeager tour guides. Close your eyes and listen to an abridged -- though it hardly feels like it -- exposition that mixes science theology and dark doings. One might add Read by Tom Hanks Ayelet Zurer and a host of other fine actors including Ewan McGregor and Armin Mueller- Stahl. If you did not find ""The Da Vinci Code"" bedeviled by similar problems then there is hope for you. The rest? Be warned. Hanks returns (his proto-mullet does not) as Harvard symbology professor Robert Langdon. Hes summoned to Vatican City when a physicist meets a cruel end. A brand on the chest of the victim suggests the resurgence of a long-dormant secret society called the Illuminati. The scientist and his colleague Vittoria Vetra had harnessed antimatter. Or ""the God particle"" as Zurers character explains after the canister containing the unstable material is stolen. (In the novel the physicists are father and daughter and this adaptation takes more liberties with its source than ""The Da Vinci Code."") An audacious crime is followed by an outrageous one. The four cardinals most likely to succeed the pontiff have been kidnapped by the same organization that stole the antimatter. The abductions pit the camerlengo (McGregor) against savvy Cardinal Strauss (Mueller-Stahl); the Swiss Guard commander (Stellan Skarsgard) against a gendarmerie inspector (Pierfrancesco Favino). And most important science against religion. It is indeed serious stuff a fact Hans Zimmers score wont let us forget. A brief note on the premise Although the actual Illuminati were founded in Bavaria in 1776 ""Angels amp; Demons"" repositions them quite a bit earlier. So 17th-century artist Bernini was an Illuminatus or ""enlightened one."" So too Galileo who so unnerved the church in the 17th century that he was tried for heresy and spent his final years under house arrest. It is this kind of promiscuous tweaking of fact and fancy that has provided page-turning entertainment but has hardly endeared Brown to the Catholic Church. Religion and science just cant get along. This is the crux of ""Angels amp; Demons."" Had it been handled well there might have been potent moments. Instead were left with mostly pedantic ones. Howard seems to count on audience goodwill toward Hanks carrying over to Langdon filling in the heros many blanks. On the page Langdon is erudite but hes hardly a blowhard. Onscreen Hanks doesnt puff him up exactly but hes bled of any levity. A know-it-all riff delivered while walking (of course) through a hall of fig- leafed statues even suggests hes a bit of a bore. Given the global success of ""The Da Vinci Code"" one could argue that Howard amp; Co. had figured out the ""The Da Vinci Code"" just fine thank you very much. After all 750 million sounds an awful lot like a lesson understood. Our only counter Mammon is never the sole measure of movie manna.

Video by Sony Pictures>> LAUNCH VIDEO PLAYER Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By John Anderson Special to The Washington Post Friday May 15 2009 Novelist Dan Brown whose ""Angels amp; Demons"" is such a slab of cheese it ought to come with a box of crackers has fueled his most successful potboilers with the mysteries of the Catholic Church. The church it turns out has nothing on the workings of Ron Howard. This StoryMovies Heaven amp; DearthSummer Movies 2009Find Showtimes TicketsAngels amp; DemonsTalk Will Angels Beat Star Trek at Box Office?View All Items in This StoryView Only Top Items in This Story In bringing Browns pre-""Da Vinci Code"" novel to the screen -- and praying for another 750 million payday -- the director has decided that plot character and motivations should be treated like the Third Secret of Fatima. If youve read the book youll merely be confused. If you havent youll think Tom Hanks is speaking Latin. There are enjoyable distractions of course including Rome itself the glories of the Vatican people flying through the air priceless art reduced to dust and guns going off in church. But the script by David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman contains so much explanation that one has to assume the target audience is the same as Dora the Explorers -- which perhaps just shows the anti-cinematic character of Browns story. Its a standard literary technique for an author to lard his prose with obscure detail to immerse a reader in atmosphere. Brown does this and then explains everything hes told you. Koepp and Goldsman adopt the Brown tactic (they have to) but take it one step further explaining everything via dialogue. The result is that characters are constantly telling each other things they should already know translating foreign words into English in the middle of conversations and then explaining everything again. The effect? Supposedly sophisticated characters become mere delivery systems for arcane information that Howard cant otherwise get into his story and upon which all the thrills and chills depend. And then the movie ends. And not a moment too soon. Hanks reprising (or is it ""pre-prising""?) his ""Da Vinci"" role as Harvard iconographer-symbologist Robert Langdon looks game but uncomfortable. The script actually comes alive only when it departs from Brown allowing Hanks to play a Koepp-Goldsman line for a laugh. But what the movie is supposed to accomplish -- laying out a fairly complex mystery in a way that creates suspense -- is precisely what it doesnt do. As ""Aamp;Ds"" many readers know Langdon is recruited by a mysterious emissary of a mysterious biotech firm to help explain the mysterious death of a mysterious scientist whose chest was branded by his killer with ""Illuminati"" the name of an ancient league of science-minded elites. The Illuminati were dedicated to the destruction of the Vatican and its anti-Galilean ethos. Has the group long thought dead resurfaced? Langdon is stunned that (1) anyone knows what the Illuminati are (2) that they might still exist and (3) that the group would assassinate a man of science. But what the killer is after is the antimatter recently developed in the dead mans lab. He intends to use it to level St. Peters Basilica but -- and heres where things really get complicated -- not until four kidnapped cardinals who happen to be in town for a papal election are murdered in a brutal ritualized fashion. Thankfully that process is prolonged just enough for Langdon to race around the Eternal City desperately trying to solve the peculiar puzzle before the murders are carried out. Some of the changes that have occurred between book and movie are revealing In the novel which was published in 2000 the villain was an Arab. Not anymore. One of the four kidnapped cardinals is now black -- an astute move given how closely an African cardinal reportedly came to winning the last papal election. And Olivetti (Pierfrancesco Favino) the Swiss Guard officer who is so antagonistic to Langdon in the book is now a sympathetic Vatican cop. Mercifully theres no romance fabricated between Hanks and his much younger co-star Ayelet Zurer who plays Vittoria the intrepid physicist whose purpose is to fill in the gaps in Langdons science education (and ours). Theres no chemistry there anyway. As they embark on their frantic mission to save the center of Roman Catholicism the two encounter a young papal assistant (Ewan McGregor) a suspiciously churlish Vatican policeman (Stellan Skarsgard) and an imperious cardinal (Armin Mueller-Stahl) who is trying to keep the papal electors together while Langdon saves their bacon. Just in case anyone thinks that the international character of the cast has something to do with brotherhood and ecumenism the leaden ""Da Vinci Code"" made more than twice as much money overseas as in the States and the ""Aamp;D"" cast reflects its global aspirations -- McGregor is Scottish playing Irish; Zurer is Israeli playing Italian; Skarsgard is Swedish playing German. The filmmakers might have faith in their story. But they also know that God helps those who help themselves.

Youll be pleased to know that since he did all that anagram-solving as he chased down the Holy Grail in The Da Vinci Code Harvard ""symbologist"" Robert Langdon has slimmed down. As played by Tom Hanks he swims laps every morning at 5 oclock now -- which is what hes doing when a worried-looking representative of the Vatican shows up at the outset of Angels amp; Demons. He has with him not an anagram but an ambigram a typographical rendering of a secret societys name ""Illuminati"" that reads the same whether you look at it right side up or upside down. It seems that four of the cardinals whove been assembling to select a new pope have been kidnapped and a note sent promising that theyll be publicly executed one each hour starting at 8 oclock that very night. Youd think this would have prompted a call to the police but the Vatican works in mysterious ways -- and apparently without a fax machine -- so theyve sent this guy 3000 miles to Massachusetts with the ambigram hoping to intrigue the puzzle- and mystery-solving symbologist. Langdon agrees to take the case of course because otherwise wed have no movie and then the plot not only thickens but also sexes itself up a bit. Gorgeous bio-physicist Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer) is in the Swiss Guards office when he arrives because a canister of explosive antimatter has been stolen from her fathers nuclear lab -- and because nobody but nobody ever goes to the police in Italy. That gets things well and truly started but this being a Dan Brown story rest assured there is more -- soooo much more. Langdon being an academic immediately insists on risking his life looking up Galileo at the library while Vittoria heads for ... well Im not sure I remember where exactly. Maybe to talk with Ewan McGregors papal camerlengo who is trying to convince the cardinals both that theyre not at war with science and that science is trying to kill them. All of which gets a bit thick but also gives the stars time to go racing around Rome to see which way statues of angels are pointing their fingers. Why? Because the Illuminati -- that society that has kept its secrets for centuries or so the movie posits -- would never indulge in a bit of sculptural misdirection about where theyre going to kill a brace or two of cardinals right? Presumably in response to criticism that The Da Vinci Code was static and talky director Ron Howard has made Angels amp; Demons frantic -- and well talky. Hes gotten quite good at making statues look threatening though and at propelling frightened characters headlong down cramped catacomb tunnels. When it comes to murder in the cinematic cathedral he may now be Hollywoods go-to guy. That said theres only so much he can do with Browns genuinely idiotic plotline or the fact that the pro-science-Illuminati anti-science-church stuff doesnt really make sense. Nor I should note do claims that the film is somehow anti-Catholic. You wont find any incendiary controversies in Angels amp; Demons though at one point a cardinal does go up in flames perfectly persuasively.

Faith that this will match the 750 million worldwide gross of The Da Vinci Code and theyll all be in for lots of lovely Mammon. On this occasion crisis hits the Vatican after the death of the Pope and the election of a new leader for the worlds billion Catholics. Four cardinals have been kidnapped and worse still a stashed-away vial of ultra-combustible anti-matter (stolen from the CERN labs in Switzerland) threatens to blow half of Rome to kingdom come. Enter Tom Hankss exposition-spouting symbologist to explain the historical basis and present implications of this attack from the self-styled Illuminati- men of Renaissance learning who went underground centuries ago after the Vatican moved against them and are using modern technology to hit back.The conflict between religion and science gestures towards thematic substance but the film unsurprisingly takes a conciliatory line to give both sides of the argument their due. With only hours before the Vatican goes ka-boom the story is pacy enough despite the cast - Ewan McGregors peachy papal insider grumpy Vatican security chief Stellan Skarsgard - needing to explain the plot every five minutes while a miscast Hanks traces a string of conveniently planted clues and the clock ticks away. The re-creation of St Peters and the Sistine Chapel on the Hollywood backlot is a production achievement yet the movies about as exciting as looking over someones shoulder while they finish a crossword.

I enjoyed them both and almost wish I didnt even bother to watch the movies. They werent true to the story but that seems to be the norm with book to movie formats. I felt the left out key details which would have helped explain what was going on. I cant believe Dan Brown would sign off on these movies. The movie seemed rather dull with none of the action that was felt reading the book.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 6 2009johnFeaturedBrutal movie.

Well to be fair he also sped from one church to next in a modest hatchback to intesnse orchestral music. They almost tricked me for a second...they almost tricked me into thinking i was excited. This film is a testament to how much a brilliant music score can do to make up for inadequacy. This film was Hans Zimmer with an unfortunate doody on top. I actually fell asleep in this film. I missed one of the curches...as i gather he went into the church and there was dust there. I woke up just in time to be massively offended by the ending. Let me emphasise that this film is NOT in any way shape or form anti religious. It had certainly gained converts for the catholic church. For some reason which i cannopt figure out the last half hour seemed to be an exercise in how far Ron Howard could get his head into the popes arse. I sat open mouthed as he kneeled down and thrusted his head into the popes arse. And then to my horror he squeezed in up to the shoulders and by the end he was inside the popes arse up to his waist. The film gave the following message Scientists are becoming a bit rash with their dangerous experiments and they dont really know what theyre dealing with. The church is a little old fashioned by its intentions are good. And finally the ultimate insult the old ""religion and science are two sides of the same coin"" trick. Die. DIE. Literally die right now ron howard. You have a responsibility to the audience not to be shit. There are young impressionable people watching this film and your taking a shit in their little minds. STOP SHITTING IN THE MINDS OF OUR CHILDREN RON HOWARD. STOP. Words cannot describe how terrible this film is. The Da Vinci Code was an acceptable film. It still licked christianitys ass but it was alright (largely thanks to Hans Zimmer who i love more than my mother) I fail to see how at any stage they thought this would be good. Everything is wrong with it. Its boring. Its badly written. And worst of all it is a whore. Actually wait thats an insult to whores who quite frankly provide a valuable service. This film is a very poor whore who draws everyone in by pretending to be outrageous and contreversial and turns out to be an utter dissapointment with a fantastic soundtrack.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJun 7 2009rickFeaturedI found angels and demons to be some what of an anti climax after watching the da vinci code i expected a lot more. As usual Tom Hanks gave a sterling performance to make the production a little more palatable but what Tom made up for with talent the script took away with a blase unbeleivable account of the catholic church. Perhaps dan brown had taken into account the outrage the first film caused but what unfolded was almost an interpretation of the catholic church. I did enjoy the film despite the short comings and found it entertaining but dont think this film will win any oscars. A three star a four star being very genourous.

Mark Kelly looks back at the series which includes The Bourne Identity The Bourne Supremacy The Bourne Ultimatum and The Bourne Legacy. Image Universal Pictures/Everett Collection By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Updated July 29 2016 710 p.m. ET 68 COMMENTS Heres to truth in advertising. Go to the official website for "" Jason Bourne"" and what pops up immediately is a nonstop loop of riots raging fires car chases car crashes and brutishly ugly hand-to-hand combat interspersed with occasional glimpses of Matt Damons scowling countenance. Loops are by definition nonstop and the only way you can get rid of this one is to close the window. Still its a fair representation of the movie which puts its hero through a much longer loop of heavy-duty punishment interspersed with familiar sequences of omniscient electronic surveillance. Bourne used to be an anguished amnesiac. Now he remembers who he is but this fourth episode of the franchise forgot to make him human. Instead of using the last pieces of his self-discovery to open him up the film makes him more tightly shut down than ever a relentlessly grim avenger who wants to expose yet another nefarious program being hatched by a CIA that aspires to ""full-spectrum surveillance"" or watching everyone all the time. The chases are exciting up to a point; the director Paul Greengrass is a virtuoso filmmaker. But oh how they do vroom on. And when Bourne isnt being chased by a villainous agency assassin played by Vincent Cassel or by cops in various countries who do the agencys bidding hes being tracked by an array of technologies that give new meaning to whats become an obligatory phrase in high-tech thrillers ""Give me eyeballs on him."" (The most prominent snoops are the CIAs director Robert Dewey who is played by Tommy Lee Jones and his deputy Alicia Vikanders Heather Lee.) More Reviews Gleason Indignation Summer Movie Preview Interactive Watch trailers and read more about the summers crop of films Those all-seeing eyes of a digital god include as in previous episodes satellites a seeming infinitude of CCTV cameras and facial recognition systems that can pick Bournes face out of every crowd he tries to hide in. Omniscient surveillance has to be sure become an action-thriller staple even though it drains suspense by making chases easier just as computers have weakened police procedurals by making investigations easier. Whats newish here is the numbing amount of time the film spends on people halfway around the globe watching Bourne on myriad screens while giving his pursuers turn-by-turn directions that Waze users could only dream of. If you want to be generous toward the all-the-worlds-a-network screenplay that Mr. Greengrass wrote with the films editor Christopher Rouse its a lively sampling of themes ripped from the headlines or from classic films cyberwarfare; Edward Snowden; ""The Terminator"" (the villain drives a destructo truck); ""The Manchurian Candidate""; the cybersecurity conflict between personal privacy and public safety ( Riz Ahmed is Aaron Kalloor aka Steve Zuckerberg Gates a Silicon Valley titan whos been in bed with the CIA and wants to climb out). But if youre not feeling generous--and I leaned to the Not side after less than an hour--its a collection of repetitive tropes that Mr. Rouses pumped-up editing has turned into a two-hour version of a 100-yard dash. ( Barry Ackroyd did the flashy cinematography.) Watch a film clip from Jason Bourne starring Matt Damon and Julia Stiles. Photo Universal Pictures Mr. Damon is as always a strong presence; its remarkable that he can do such a buoyant man on Mars and such a dour Jason Bourne. Ms. Vikander taking over where Joan Allen left off makes up in appealing ambiguity what she lacks in Ms. Allens steeliness. Julia Stiles is back and welcome as Nicky Parsons. Mr. Jones has been made up--some of that is makeup isnt it?--to look like a cross between Lucifer and Nixon and he does his airy-authority number with well airy authority. He also gets--and earns--what is by my count the only laugh in the entire film. You dont go to a Bourne movie to laugh of course but neither do you go to get worn down. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download The Martian (2015) Matt Damons astronaut Mark Watney doesnt just struggle to survive on Mars after his crew assumes he has died during an epic storm and leaves him behind. He lives a rich intense life sustained by wry humor piercing intelligence and an irrepressible spirit of invention. Knowing the premise wont prepare you for the remarkable variety and complexity of this sci-fi extravaganza which Ridley Scott directed from Drew Goddards exuberant adaptation of the Andy Weir novel. 35 Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Jason Bourne Whats Happened So Far?

ABOUT THE MOVIEAngels amp; Demons  (out of four)Stars Tom Hanks Ewan McGregor Ayelet Zurer Stellan Skarsgard Armin Mueller StahlDirector Ron HowardDistributor Columbia PicturesRating PG-13 for sequences of violence disturbing images and thematic materialRunning time 2 hours 10 minutes Opens Thursday in select theaters and Friday nationwide WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Apparently the quality of movies based on Dan Browns best sellers correlates directly with the style of Tom Hanks hair. Angels amp; Demons is better though not by much than 2006s Da Vinci Code. The story however is less interesting and even more far-fetched. VOTE Which Hanks role had the most horrible hair? Hanks is likable and credible reprising his role as irreverent code-cracking Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon. But director Ron Howard focuses more on spec- tacular shots particularly during a climactic scene involving a helicopter ride above the Vatican than on tension and excitement. The story with its arcane riddles and preposterous twists does not translate well to the screen. It fails as an action thriller relying on wordy exposition. And the array of clues and riddles unearthed by Langdon are as improbable as the notion of a secret cult of vengeful scientists. Still for an academic Langdon has some impressive action-hero moves. And he needs them Hes up against a one-man terrorist brigade. The ubiquitous bad guy is an assassin acting in the name of the ""Illuminati"" an ancient brotherhood of scientists. Its hard to get too worked up about villains made up of astronomers philosophers and physicists. The clock is ticking as a bomb is aimed at St. Peters in Rome. Langdon joins forces with an Italian scientist alliteratively named Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer). The two spend too much time poring over ancient texts to make pulses race. Its a meeting of minds not lips. The movie posits that Langdon a man of science may have a shred of faith he doesnt acknowledge. But it deals heavy-handedly with the faith vs. science debate. The dialogue tries to be portentous but it reeks of cliche. ""Were in Gods hands now"" intones papal representative Father Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor). Meanwhile Langdon lectures and pontificates even as he races to unearth a bomb. Angels doesnt know when to quit Just when you think its over it continues like the franchise based on Browns books.

"Angels amp; Demons Commits cardinal sin of tedium | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsAngels amp; Demons Commits cardinal sin of tediumAstoundingly the Vatican is okay with Angels amp; Demons  declaring the film to be ""harmless entertainment"" and ""a bit of fun"" in the official church newspaper LOsservatore Romano .Angels amp; Demons protagonist Robert Langdon is a character so bland that not even actor Tom Hanks can enliven him writes Peter Howell.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. May 14 2009 Angels amp; Demons (out of 4)Starring Tom Hanks Ewan McGregor Stellan Skarsgard Armin Mueller-Stahl and Ayelet Zurer. Directed by Ron Howard. 138 minutes. At major theatres. 14A Astoundingly the Vatican is okay with Angels amp; Demons declaring the film to be ""harmless entertainment"" and ""a bit of fun"" in the official church newspaper LOsservatore Romano.Director Ron Howards bleats about a Vatican vendetta and fears by conservative Catholics about a Hollywood hatchet job appear to be nothing more than papal bull.But where does this leave us popcorn-chewing Philistines? Deprived of the sizzling heat of hellfire for viewing forbidden secrets we must judge the film strictly on its cinematic merits. Unholy thoughts arise.Once again Howard sends a saint to do a sinners job. Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon first seen in Howards earlier The Da Vinci Code (both films are based on bestselling Dan Brown novels) is the butter knife of action blades the kind of guy James Bond or Jason Bourne would clock before the end of the first reel. Hes a man of such bland demeanour and nerdish intensity that not even Tom Hankss acting prowess and quicksilver personality can enliven him. Langdons only quirks if you want to call them that are that hes an agnostic fascinated by religious artifacts and that he wears a Mickey Mouse watch. Hes completely uninterested in sex even when hes close to steamy Ayelet Zurer who succeeds The Da Vinci Codes Audrey Tautou as the brainy female sidekick. The only things that excite Langdon are the curves of marble statues and the touch of dusty tomes. Harmless indeed.And where is the ""fun"" of which the Vatican scribes speak? Angels amp; Demons is no barrel of monkeys even when judged by the generous levity of the guys who gave thumbs up to the Spanish Inquisition.Presented as a sequel to Da Vinci rather than the prequel Brown intended it concerns a plot to blow up St. Peters Basilica hatched by a secret society of outlawed Catholic fanatics called the Illuminati who harbour a 200-year-old grudge against the Church rather recent in Catholic terms.Lord knows this is no ordinary bomb. Its made of glowing antimatter stolen from the CERN particle physics lab in Switzerland. An eyeball-rolling prologue sets up the films science-vs.-religion subtext in the midst of a murder.The canister containing the antimatter enough to send all of Vatican City to kingdom come has been placed somewhere within St. Peters. The bomb runs on batteries which CERN scientist Vittoria Vetra (Zurer) estimates will run out at midnight upon which all hell will bust loose. Just to keep things interesting the Illuminati are also threatening to kill four top cardinals one per hour leading up to midnight. Oh and theres a papal conclave going on since the Pope just died in less than providential circumstances. Browns overheated story pared down by screenwriters David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman requires Langdon and Vetra to instantly decipher clues that the Illuminati puzzlers spent ages arranging all while dashing through Rome attempting to lower the body count of cardinals.Its a funny thing about Browns books. They read like screenplays with brisk chapters constant action and even authorial suggestions as to casting (Brown saw Harrison Ford as Langdon).The books make great beach or airport reads. But transformed to the screen at least under the direction of the utterly vanilla Howard they come across as almost laughable. The best that can be said about Angels amp; Demons is that its more of a conventional thriller (replete with onscreen countdowns) and less talky than The Da Vinci Code and that Hanks is no longer getting his hair cut at Fort Apache. Still like its predecessor Angels amp; Demons manages the miraculous feat of seeming to plod while racing at breakneck speed the tempo set by Hans Zimmers blusterous score. Which leads the mind to wander.Who could take seriously a plot in which the Energizer bunny is required to stop a battery-powered can of antimatter whoop-ass from erupting in Rome? Would even the most fanatical of Catholics keep a papal conclave going knowing that the clock is rapidly ticking towards oblivion? And is Langdon ever going to get some action outside of a church or crypt?Perhaps these absurdities constitute the ""fun"" those ink-stained Vatican wretches were referring to.

"Angels amp; Demonsreviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Angels amp; Demonsreviewed. Angels amp; Demonsreviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 14 2009 635 PM Its Hard Out There for a Symbologist Tom Hanks returns in a sequel to The Da Vinci Code. By Dana Stevens Also in Slate George Johnson examines the Catholic Churchs long history with Illuminati conspiracy theories. Tom Hanks and Ayelet Zurer in Angels amp; Demons Fire up the faux- Carl Orff generator and brush off your chasuble Its time for Angels amp; Demons (Columbia Pictures) the inevitable sequel to The Da Vinci Code Ron Howards adaptation of the mega-best-selling occult thriller by Dan Brown. The Da Vinci Code was turgid to the point of unwatchability yet it grossed 750 million worldwide testifying to a universal human appetite for arcane conspiracy theories imaginatively murdered clergymen and Tom Hanks. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. In Angels amp; Demons Howard makes some gestures of reparation toward the critics who protested The Da Vinci Codes deadly pacing. Instead of having Hanks and his love interest stand around in a series of dusty churches he has them rush really fast through a series of dusty churches. But really there was no need to tinker. Angels amp; Demons doesnt have to do good works to get to box office heaven. Its salvation will come through the faith of its audience alone. Advertisement Two weeks after the sudden death of a ""progressive pope"" (there goes the movies credibility right there) a canister containing deadly antimatter is stolen from a supercollider in Switzerland. Soon after the preferiti--the four cardinals considered most likely to be named the popes successor--are kidnapped from the Vatican and held hostage by a madman (Nikolaj Lie Kaas). Because the ransom notes reference the Illuminati an ancient anti-clerical sect Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is called in for consultation though the church is still wary of him after that whole Jesus-had-kids thing. Soon Langdon aided by Italian biophysicist Vittoria Vetra (Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer) deduces that the kidnapper has placed the doomsday device somewhere in the Vatican and plans to kill one cardinal per hour before detonating it at midnight. If only Angels amp; Demons were as rollickingly silly as that plot summary makes it sound. In its last 20 minutes Angels does attain the status of good bad movie with a transcendently absurd climax thats great fun to rehash later over burgers. Unfortunately the only part I can summarize without spoilers is the dull first hour and a half in which Hanks and Zurer race around Rome having impenetrable conversations in front of world-historical art treasures. Take my advice and stop trying to keep up with their investigation; just let the words pentagram and apse and camerlengo wash over you pleasantly as you ogle the Bernini statues and coffered ceilings. An unintentionally sad passage in the films production notes details how the presence of Hanks amp; company on location distracted passing tourists from the grandeur that was Rome ""A simple shot of Hanks and Zurer walking across the Piazza della Rotonda in front of the Pantheon attracted hundreds of onlookers who often had their backs to the ancient Roman temple [...] just to photograph the filming."" Lavish as the settings are (the movie was filmed partly on location partly on digitally augmented back lots) Howard often treats the city in a similarly crass manner The Sistine Chapel and the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi are just backdrops against which to stage the either banal or horrifically violent action. Though the PG 13-rated Angels amp; Demons thinks nothing of showing bodies being branded tortured and burned alive the film exhibits a monkish restraint when it comes to bodies enjoying themselves. As in The Da Vinci Code Howard makes the curious choice of pairing Hanks with a beautiful female sidekick while depriving their interactions of the slightest erotic charge. In the first movie I guess the sexlessness made some sense. (Though if Jesus himself got it on why shouldnt his sole living descendant?) But Robert and Vittoria are two nondivine consenting adults facing what may be their last night on earth and the naughtiest thing they do together is rip a page out of an ancient text by Galileo. Ewan McGregor as an Irish priest beloved of the deceased pontiff; Stellan Skarsgard as the head of the Swiss Guard; and Armin Mueller-Stahl as a cardinal high in the Vatican hierarchy all stomp gamely around the Holy See trying not to telegraph the plot twists that will reveal whether theyre demons or angels. And in those aforementioned final minutes--Lord deliver me from the temptation to spoil them--McGregors priest gets to have what I can only describe as the busiest evening of any movie character in memory. If nothing else Angels amp; Demons proves that as McGuffins go a cylinder of antimatter is more fun than the Holy Grail.

"Angels amp; Demons | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; angels-demons ) Angels amp; Demons (United States 2009) May 14 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli The term ""godawful"" should be used sparingly in connection with motion pictures. With Angels amp; Demons however it seems oddly appropriate. Not only does this prequel-turned-sequel to The Da Vinci Code make its predecessor seem like a masterwork of pacing and plotting but it may represent a nadir for director Ron Howard and is probably the worst instance of acting from star Tom Hanks since back in the days when he was struggling out from under the shadow of Bosom Buddies. Interestingly this is also the first sequel with which Hanks (as a live-action actor) and Howard (behind the camera) have been involved. As with The Da Vinci Code Angels amp; Demons begins with a murder - a scientist working in the CERN Large Hadron Collider in Geneva. His death is a means to an end as his killer makes off with a canister containing antimatter. To the best of my knowledge he does not steal any dilithium crystals. Meanwhile in the Vatican the cardinals have finished mourning the death of the pope and are preparing to elect his successor. Inconveniently the most likely four candidates have been kidnapped and a group claiming association with the underground society of the Illuminati are threatening to kill them before unleashing the antimatter and turning half of Rome into a wasteland. Enter symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) who has been recruited by the Vatican because hes an expert on Illuminati. He is teamed with one of the scientists who created the antimatter Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer) and a crusty Vatican cop Inspector Olivetti (Pierfrancesoco Favino). After receiving the grudging support of the head of the Swiss Guard Commander Richter (Stellan SkarsgAY=rd) and the ""acting"" pontiff Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor) Langdon enters the Vatican Archives in search of clues that will put him on the Illuminatis trail. One difference between an effective thriller and one that crashes and burns is easily identified are the contrivances and coincidences noticeable only once the theater is vacated or are they obvious during the proceedings? Sadly in the case of Angels amp; Demons its the latter. This movie takes preposterousness to new levels; there are times when the proceedings become so ludicrous that one is tempted to laugh aloud at the sheer audacity of the plotting. Antimatter? A body count in the Vatican with deaths by earth air fire and water? A plot so convoluted that not even Machiavelli would have followed it? The biggest mystery of all is how so much talent (David Koepp Akiva Goldsmith Ron Howard Tom Hanks) could band together to create something this dumb limp and lifeless. The movies first 90 minutes represent what I refer to as ""treadmill proceedings"" - thats when characters run fast and get nowhere. Indeed for the first 2/3 of Angels amp; Demons running time we follow Langdon as he uncovers one improbable clue after another. Clues and signs dont lead directly to the solution of course - they lead to other clues that in turn lead to still more clues. Bathroom breaks during this portion of the movie are not only allowed they are encouraged. Even if you are unlucky enough to miss a chunk of exposition it wont damage your ability to follow the plot-by-numbers storyline. In fact if youre even slightly perceptive youll have the big ""twist"" ending figured out 30 minutes into the movie. One way to remain awake during the course of all the repetitious running around is to marvel at the coincidences and contrivances that have to pile upon one another for the still-to-be-unmasked villains master plan to work. Its enough to make one believe in God. Then again following that line of reasoning sitting through this movie provides a possible representation of Hell. In order to earn his mammoth salary all Hanks has to do is show up which he does investing Langdon with less passion than the scenery. One has to go all the way back to 1990s The Bonfire of the Vanities to find an equally uninspired portrayal on the two-time Oscar winners resume. Equally bad is Ewan McGregor whose work here makes one re-evaluate his interpretation of Obi-Wan Kenobi as an example of nuanced acting. To be fair there are some nice performances although in secondary parts. Stellan SkarsgAY=rd is suitably menacing as a man who is too obviously being foreshadowed as the ""heavy."" And Armin Mueller-Stahl makes the most of a largely thankless part. Catholic groups are threatening to boycott the movie and their reaction is understandable. Mid-way through the movie I was hoping the antimatter bomb would go off and wipe out the Vatican although that might have something to do with eliminating Langdon and the possibility of another sequel. For the most part Catholic Cardinals are not favorably portrayed - they come across as petty squabbling opportunists. I have no way to assess the accuracy of the ""insider information"" provided about the internal workings of the Vatican. They seem far-fetched but truth is often stranger than fiction and the cynic in me suggests that maybe they represent the most honest aspect of this film. If theres something to appreciate about Angels amp; Demons its the cheesy absurdity of the final 40 minutes. Once the pointless running around comes to an end we can sit back and enjoy a series of plot contortions so baffling that its difficult not to savor them on the level of pure camp. Rarely does a major motion picture go this far off the deep end. Its the proverbial train wreck and it actually manages to share a scene with - of all things - Star Trek. Of course the problem with Angels amp; Demons is that to get to the final 40 minutes its necessary to endure the first 90 and that would be defined as cruel and unusual punishment. To add insult to injury not only is Angels amp; Demons pitched at viewers who are half-asleep drugged drunk or simply uncaring but it offers an embarrassing homily about the importance of science and religion co-existing. Yes after spending two hours trouncing Catholicism and trashing legitimate science Angels amp; Demons wants to send viewers home with a moral. Let me offer this alternative if you want a movie with antimatter this is not the one for which you should buy a ticket.

Although it cloaks itself in a mantle of scholarship its rooted in reality about as firmly as ""Twilight"" ""Harry Potter"" and ""Star Trek."" That said how does it work as fantasy? Not so well even though the sluggish ""Da Vinci Code"" is an easy act to follow. Theres not a moment of inspiration on display here but ample craft and professional technique. This time the story of international intrigue is structured around an old-fashioned American chase. A canister of antimatter -- a crackling cloud of static in a vacuum tube -- has been stolen from the CERN Large Hadron Collider lab in Switzerland. It appears that the Illuminati a secret society of freethinkers nursing a centuries-old grudge against Catholic Church turned the device into a doomsday weapon. It will detonate at midnight vaporizing the conclave of cardinals gathered to elect the new Pope as well as thousands of faithful assembled in St. Peters Square. Only Harvard symbol expert Robert Langdon who considers religion the enemy of reason if not the root of all evil can unravel the plot and save the center of Catholicism. The movie looks great -- millions of dollars of set design brocade and incense went into it -- but its grandiose and coldly lacking in human dimensions. All the familiar buffoonery of the suspense-thriller genre is here the better to simplify author Dan Browns convoluted plot onscreen. We have a ticking clock with four kidnapped church leaders to be scheduled for assassination in the hours before the detonation. Langdons mysterious nemesis leaves taunting clues requiring him to dash across the city in a wild goose chase. The tweedy codebuster ricochets around Rome director Ron Howard swings the camera like Barry Bonds and Hans Zimmers agitated orchestra and choir tingle our spines. Inside each church is an angel sculpture pointing to another church. With clockwork precision Langdon always arrives moments too late. Time and again he bursts in on gruesome slasher-film tableaus of aged churchmen branded with the symbols for Earth Air Fire and Water. Screenwriters David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman dont even try for plausibility. They just hurl us from one crisis to the next propelling the movie by fits and starts. ANGELS amp; DEMONS  OUT OF FOUR STARS Rating PG-13 for sequences of violence disturbing images and thematic material. Langdon is an appealing hero a brain who never throws a punch or fires a gun but cracks open deadly conspiracies with arcane knowledge and street smarts. Tom Hanks again brings his everyman decency to the role and this time he has thankfully retired the mullet. What a gift he has spitting out arcane historical material as if it were plainspoken dialogue. As his sidekick Italian physicist Vittoria Vetra Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer has a winning balance of intelligence moxie and snake-hipped sexiness. In ""Da Vinci"" the absence of chemistry between Hanks and Audrey Tatou seemed like an oversight. Here the costars are so reserved and businesslike that their lack of a relationship feels correct. Theyve got four hours to save Rome from an antimatter explosion. Whos got time to throw coins in the fountains? Ewan McGregor is all wide-eyed innocence as the young interim overseer of the papacy Armin Mueller-Stahl brings a menacing dignity to the role of mysterious Cardinal Strauss and Stellan Skarsgard growls and glowers as the sour head of Vatican security. For all the talk of Galileo Michelangelo and Bernini this is fast flashy empty-minded entertainment. When Hanks runs through catacombs with a flashlight in hand you half expect him to run into Nic Cage coming the other way.

Tom Hanks stars in the suspense thriller Angels amp; Demons. Photo Zade Rosenthal  Columbia Pictures | MCT Angels amp; Demons 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Beforeanyone gets his cassock in a twist over Dan Browns anti-Catholic messages in Angels amp; Demons just consider it science fiction. The movie is so preposterous so far removed from anything resembling a real-world scenario that we might as well unpack the anti-Romulan prejudice inStar Trek. For starters the entire movie hinges on a jar of antimatter. Yes antimatter the elementary quantum stuff that fuels the Enterprise and exists in reality for teeny moments in tiny quantities at massive particle colliders. Physicists have managed to generate fleeting bits of antimatter but never enough to drive a starship or you know blow up the Vatican or anything. So far. But check this out In Ron Howards follow-up to The Da Vinci Code scientists create an entire Plexiglas canister full of winking anti-substance. They hope to devise an efficient new energy source. Instead a creepy guy in glasses breaks into the lab steals someones eyeball gets past the retinal scanner and makes his way into an otherwise totally unguarded room holding the antimatter. Unlike most movie villains who would use such a weapon to destroy New York City and parts of Long Island the baddie in Angels amp; Demons takes this catastrophic weapon and plants it at a holy site in Rome. He also kidnaps four cardinals in the running for the papacy a job opening about to be filled in conclave after the death of a beloved pope. Whats his beef with the church? All clues suggest an ancient grudge nursed by the Illuminati defined by Demons as a mystery-cloaked brotherhood of enlightened thinkers who were persecuted by Rome some centuries back and never forgave or forgot. Just ask Robert Langdon the globe-hopping Harvard symbologist (Tom Hanks again) whos roped into the case by Vatican cops desperate to solve it before the villain starts popping off cardinals one by one. So Langdon flies off to Rome meeting priests both haughty (Armin Mueller-Stahl) and humble (Ewan McGregor). Accompanied by Vittoria (Ayelet Zurer) an Italian scientist with no clear plot relevancy he digs up coded tracts and whirls around the city in a mad search for churches and statues (Raphaels this Berninis that) with Illuminati connections. Theres also the little matter of antimatter to address. After a while it all adds up to Seven. Its too lurid too long. Too much is telegraphed. Vittoria makes too many stupid errors. After getting her hands on a top-secret journal she then stuffs it into the nearest unlocked desk (cut to close-up of drawer) and wanders off leaving it in the presence of a dubious-looking Swiss guard. But I have to say the whole ridiculous affair is much less boring than The Da Vinci Code and its sharper-looking It has the busy convolutions propulsive effects and generally sleek production values of a brainless summer thriller. McGregor a newcomer to the Dan Brown universe laps up his part with delicacy and relish. As for Hanks he seems to have relocated his sense of humor; he has a few moments of flapping exasperation not seen since A League of Their Own.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Not all trash is art but theres an art to making trash. So father forgive the makers of ""Angels amp; Demons"" for they know not what they do. Dan Browns mystery novel full of flamboyantly murdered cardinals facts of every gratuitous stripe and information kiosks masquerading as characters has been given the serious treatment. OK no movie whose climax includes a man of God plummeting in his vestments from the sky with a parachute is entirely serious.But given the books indecent juiciness theres every reason to lament the creaky contraption Ron Howard and his screenwriters Akiva Goldsman and David Koepp have devised. Howard also directed ""The Da Vinci Code"" based on the blockbuster Brown wrote after 2000s ""Angels amp; Demons."" Asking whether the new movie is better than the first is natural if moot. Would you prefer to drown in a swimming pool or an ocean?""Angels amp; Demons"" puts us back in the company of professor Robert Langdon the droopy Harvard symbologist played once more by Tom Hanks. The Vatican has summoned Langdon to look into the meaning of mysterious ghastly events on the premises. The professor has been selected for his ""expertise"" his ""erudition"" and most certainly for his hair which appears to be growing hydroponically from his scalp. The Church believes in miracles yes but what about Miracle-Gro?Langdon arrives in St. Peters Square not long after the pope has died. A conclave is underway for a replacement. But this ghastly killing with its awful markings suggests a conspiracy is afoot. Indeed Langdon deduces that the branding is the work of an ancient evil secret society called the Illuminati.The group has come out of hiding having hired an assassin to kidnap and kill each of the four papal candidates (one per hour) until midnight (the chase gets underway at 653 p.m.) at which point a stolen canister containing less than a gram of antimatter will explode in the Basilica destroying everything killing everyone. The late popes chief aide (Ewan McGregor) wants the threats publicized. But the elder cardinal overseeing the conclave (Armin Mueller-Stahl) demands secrecy and order.Who in the Church is behind this craziness? Can Langdon read the signs quickly enough to stop it? Such lines as ""Shining star at the end of the path? I thought so too"" suggest that hell at least get close. Langdon is speaking there to Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer) a scientist with luxurious curls. A colleague was slain when the canister was taken in Switzerland and she spends the movie running around Rome at Hankss side.Zurer an Israeli using a shaky Italian accent has some zest for the nonsense thrown her way. But all the chemistry between her and Hanks occurs strictly between their hair. Shes a ""bio-entanglement physicist."" So presumably when shes not working on developing antimatter shes coming up with the most amazing shampoos. At many junctures the film makes wild sad divergences from its source. I was truly looking forward to seeing Zurer say to Hanks ""Youve never been to bed with a yoga master have you?"" So much for that. Catholic groups are throwing fits about the films alleged irreverence but its not irreverent enough. Howard seems more afraid of crossing the almighty ratings board than potential boycotters.The film tips its cap to the campy and the risible. Stellan Skarsgard playing the head of the Swiss Guard speaks witheringly when he can (""Thank goodness. The symbologist is here"") the public protests near the Vatican over stem cell research are badly enough staged and acted to be enjoyable and theres a cut from a burning cardinal to an oven full of roasting communion wafers thats in delightfully poor taste.Oddly the filmmakers hold back at the risk of offense as if a way exists to sugarcoat the ridiculousness of it all. Toward the end of the film Mueller-Stahls cardinal gives Langdon some advice for his next book. ""When you write of this - and write of this you will"" he says with Yoda-like prescience ""be gentle."" Just whats needed for a movie about an ancient heretical outfit threatening to blow up the Vatican with a drop of antimatter a Puritan touch.In the 1970s the trash impulse gave us movies like ""The Exorcist"" ""The Omen"" and ""The Manitou"" where the line between sacrament and excrement was unimportant. In ""The Manitou"" seeing Tony Curtis take on the angry Native American demon growing out of Susan Strasbergs back was a hoot both because and despite of how inane it was. ""Angels amp; Demons"" is more conspiracy-minded but its base antics and profaning of the sacred are trashy.Even so Howard and the screenwriters seem to really want to make a case for the grand themes in Browns book. So just like ""The Da Vinci Code"" the film goes on for long discursive stretches in which Langdon and whoever happens to be standing near him volley the Big Ideas. This is beside the point like getting access to Pamela Anderson and reporting back that she can read.The delight of Browns book was entirely backhanded. ""Angels amp; Demons"" was crap but it was exhilarating crap. He wrote with riveting badness. Langdon was pompous Brown condescending and the sentences purple enough to give Prince pause Watching what Howard has done with the book - covering up the lewdness blunting the snobbery and spackling the amazing plot holes - is dismaying.This adaptation has the stink of superiority about it. It thinks that by deleting all the sex and playing up the theological struggles its somehow better than the novel. But Brown writes with glee and gusto like a man who recently discovered that fingers applied to a keyboard produce words. The novel was a 137-chapter typing spree.Howard simply isnt as good a filmmaker as Brown is a blissfully terrible writer. He hasnt directed with that kind of joy since ""Splash."" The self-mocking sense of humor he uses in the political ads he stars in and cameos he makes (Howard recently put in a hilarious appearance in Jamie Foxxs video for ""Blame It"") never surfaces in his movies. His Oscar has only exacerbated his addiction to prestige commercialism. Its a real problem. He cant make trash or art.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Heres whats wrong with Robert Langdon the symbologist protagonist of Dan Browns books and Ron Howards film adaptations The Da Vinci Code and Angels amp; Demons Early in the film version of Angels hes called upon to unravel a murderous plot by the Illuminati a centuries-old secret society. Flown to the Vatican and whisked into the Catholic Churchs desperate confidences because hes the only man on Earth erudite enough to solve the mystery he cant help delivering a smug impromptu lecture on the historical censorship of marble statues as he passes through a hallway lined with them. No one asked for the information his hosts are embarrassed by how those events reflect on the Church and Langdon comes across as a self-righteous showoff but what does he care? Hes the kind of action hero who barks preemptory orders at cops and cardinals alike and who keeps winding up improbably alone and at center stage whenever combat breaks out but hes also a stuffy arrogant professor-type; in short hes an ass. Tom Hanks uncharismatic impatient portrayal doesnt help but there arent many other places to go with the material hes given. The same inherent problem of form limits Angels amp; Demons. Howard recast the story as a Da Vinci Code sequel rather than prequel to justify a more confident driven Langdon and he dispenses with some of the first films leaden portentousness and all its intolerably silly whirling CGI portrayals of Langdons thoughts. But the plot itself hamstrings his streamlining attempts The pope has just died and Vatican City is crammed with onlookers awaiting a papal election. But the four preferred papal candidates have been kidnapped by a conspirator who plans to execute them at one-hour intervals at secret sites determined by an Illuminati induction ritual. Hanks has only four manic incident-packed hours to find each site in turn--it seems to take much longer in real time--before all four cardinals will be dead and the kidnapper will use stolen antimatter to blow Vatican City back to heaven. Anyone who saw The Da Vinci Code or the National Treasure movies knows how this goes A problem is presented a bunch of factoids are dumped on the table the hero leaps to an improbable conclusion as if solving the Riddlers clues in the 60s camp Batman TV series repeat. But the story requires this to be done so often at such length and via such eye-rolling leaps of logic that all Howards efforts at crafting a propulsive thriller come to nothing. And the films biggest assets--Allan Camerons sumptuous production design Salvatore Totinos cinematography and Romes staggering beauty--eventually become as oppressive and exhausting as Hans Zimmers insistent score or the scripts seemingly endless speeches about the conflict between science and religion. At half the length and with half of Hanks sneering pretension this would make a pretty terrific action film. Anyone up for just plain Demons?

The sequel is a little like CSI Vatican City - a professor and a physicist search for a stolen casket of antimatter before it blows St. Peters to kingdom come.Harvard ""symbologist"" - that is to say human decoder ring and gasbag - Robert Langdon is back this time with a much better haircut and a fractionally better script.Summoned by Vatican authorities still annoyed at his exposure of ancient church secrets Langdon (Tom Hanks) teams with brainy Bond girl - make that fetching particle physicist - Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer) on a semiotic scavenger hunt through Rome to find imperiled cardinals and save an imperiled church.The pope is dead and the College of Cardinals is meeting to name his successor as four likely candidates are abducted. They will be killed on the hour from 8 to 11 p.m. Then their captor will unleash antimatter at midnight rocking the Vatican to its foundations. The captor claims to be part of a sect of scientists belatedly avenging the papal persecution of Galileo (branded a heretic in 1615 for hypothesizing that the Earth revolved around the sun).In a gruesome robbery the abductor has stolen the antimatter from the Supercollider in Geneva drawing a new battle line in the war of those historic adversaries Faith and Science. If science claims creation what is left to God? If God created man how does the church explain evolution?And is antimatter really stored in a vacuum tube and kept stable by what looks to be a laptop battery?As Howard frames it the threat of the Supercollision between physics and faith establishes a palpable tension.Still Howards fluid camera movement Salvatore Totinos old master-ly cinematography and the Gregorian rants of Hans Zimmers score cannot redeem the Hardy Boys plotting of Dan Browns source material. Hanks Zurer Armin Mueller-Stahl (as an old-guard cardinal) Stellan SkarsgAY=rd (as chief of the Vaticans Swiss Guards) and Ewan McGregor (as the dead popes exalted personal assistant) deserve points for earnest recitations of the often-stilted dialogue.Rome wasnt built in a day but Dan Browns plot was. Evidently an unknown Illuminati master carved statues representing each of the four elements - and the captor will kill a cardinal with earth air fire and water.Given roughly five hours to save Christendom Langdon and Vetra bone up on the sculptor Bernini and sprint from Pantheon to Piazza Navona and from statue to statue.Theres Berninis Ecstasy of St. Teresa Does the angels finger point to where the captor has hidden a cardinal? Does Vetra always have to ask a question in order for Langdon to explain whats happening? Does Langdon always sound like a know-it-all?Meanwhile cardinals are branded savaged and incinerated in most grotesque fashion. (The film is rated PG-13 but the violence curdles the blood and wrenches the gut.)Up to a point a puzzle-solving momentum carries the film. For one who hasnt read the book there is too much exposition to swallow let alone digest. But even while gagging on plot I enjoyed the location shots and the artful reproductions of St. Peters Square and the Sistine Chapel (shot in L.A.). The sets so persuasively reproduce the actual locations that you can almost smell the Tiber and feel St. Peters marble chill.As is the new convention in thrillers Aamp;D concludes twists concludes and twists again. And Faith and Science get wrung into a kind of double helix. Maybe they arent on a Supercollision course. Maybe as Langdon says paraphrasing Galileo they are different languages telling the same story.From his mouth to Gods ear.Angels amp; Demons 1/2 (out of four stars)Directed by Ron Howard.

(Columbia Pictures) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday May 14 2009 1249 PM Title Angels amp; Demons Suspense sequel about a professor called in to help the Vatican stop a terrorist attack. With Tom Hanks Ewan McGregor. Director Ron Howard (218). PG-13 violence gore. At area theaters.Let no one say Ron Howard cant handle criticism. After taking a well-deserved drubbing for his dull adaptation of ""The Da Vinci Code"" hes returned with a sequel that addresses most of the first movies major issues. And yes that includes Tom Hanks hair which has thankfully been rescued from its earlier bouffant do. In fact Hanks seems a little more energized too as Harvard scholar Robert Langdon. Though ""Angels"" is actually a prequel in the world of author Dan Brown Howard sets it after ""Da Vinci."" And since the latter found Langdon challenging the most deeply-held of Catholic beliefs hes thoroughly surprised when Vatican officials ask for his help. With his knowledge of Church history however hes their best hope. An ancient sect of intellectuals called the Illuminati has resurrected itself kidnapping a quartet of high-ranking cardinals and threatening to kill one an hour to assert the supremacy of science over faith. After these four murders a bomb made of antimatter will decimate all of Vatican City. Langdon is given a very reluctant welcome by the eldest cardinal (Armin Mueller-Stahl) and chief of Vatican security (Stellan Skarsgard). But the young Camerlengo (Ewan McGregor) is more open even to a skeptic like Langdon. Besides they dont have much choice hes the only one who might be able to figure out the villains identity in time. There is no reason for all of this to take 138 minutes since the pattern repeats itself over and over Langdon races around Rome looking for clues accompanied by the beautiful scientist (a stiff Ayelet Zurer) who inadvertently created the Illuminatis weapon of mass destruction. As for the potentially provocative subject matter Howard appears far less interested in making any stands than in creating an old-fashioned thriller injected with just enough controversy to keep things interesting. And in that regard he succeeds. Despite the overlong running time the action moves smoothly and swiftly with Hans Zimmers pulsing score sweeping us from one historic crime scene to the next. You wont remember many of the stops after the movie ends but at least youll enjoy the ride.

LOsservatore Romano the official newspaper of Vatican City described this sequel to The Da Vinci Code as ""more than two hours of harmless entertainment which hardly affects the genius and mystery of Christianity"" and ""a video game that first of all sparks curiosity and is also maybe a bit of fun."" A few years back the Vatican the seat of power for the Roman Catholic Church had waxed apoplectic over The Da Vinci Code -- both the Dan Brown book and Ron Howards 2006 movie version. According to the director the Holy See blocked his attempts to shoot scenes of Angels another Brown novel in the Roman churches where much of it is set. So Howard must have found LOsservatore Romanos genial review an unexpected blessing somewhere between a celebratory puff of white smoke and the mild penance of 10 Our Fathers and 10 Hail Marys. We also hear that the papers gossip columnist Father Guido Sarducci praised Tom Hanks for looking surprisingly fit in swim trunks. (See Tom Hanks top 10 hairstyles.) Beach scenes in a religious thriller? Not quite. World-renowned symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) is taking a 5 a.m. water workout in the Harvard swimming pool when a papal emissary shows up to inform him that someone has kidnapped four prominent Cardinals all in line to be the next Pope and threatened to murder them and that very night blow up St. Peters Square with a vial of antimatter stolen from a Geneva research lab. In Rome by sundown Langdon finds adversaries in a stern Cardinal (Armin Mueller-Stahl) and the head of the Vaticans Swiss Guards (Stellan Skarsgard) and two allies in a passionate young Vatican priest (Ewan McGregor) and a scientist (Ayalet Zurer) from the antimatter lab. The meat of the story occupies about five hours that evening as Langdon rushes from one holy site to another trying to save lives and solve the big riddle Who killed the Pope? (See pictures of the Pope in the Holy Land.) The sense of chronological urgency already makes Angels amp; Demons an improvement as a movie scenario over The Da Vinci Code however spectacular a publishing success that was. The Da Vinci Code sold more than 60 million copies in 40 languages graced the New York Times best-seller list for 144 weeks or nearly three years and inspired parodies in both hard-core (The Da Vinci Load) and soft-core movies (The Da Vinci Coed). People picked it up and couldnt put it down in part because it was a very bookish book an elaborate web of church lore leading to the 2000-year-old dish that Jesus and Mary Magdalene had been married and their God-woman offspring walked the earth today. To be faithful to the book Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman had to lard the movie with giant extracts of religious arcana. Cinematically it was a slog. (Read TIMEs review of The Da Vinci Code.) But it was also the 27th top worldwide grosser in film history so here comes Angels same star director producer (Brian Grazer) and scripter (abetted this time by David Koepp). Also the same approach its a movie so wed better feign movement. The back-history in which Langdon is an expert requires Hanks to speak dialogue with its own footnotes so Howard camouflages the static nature of enterprise by having his star spout arcana while rushing from church to church. In fact virtually all the actors have to talk the talk while they walk the walk. When they take a breather and stand still the camera skates 360s around them.

Let voices rise on matters of truth versus fiction entertainment versus religious heresy book plot versus screen adaptation and old hairdo versus new coif in Tom Hanks portrayal of heroic Harvard scholar Robert Langdon previously seen irking the Vatican in The Da Vinci Code. What matters to this secular tourist visiting a high altar of bombastic filmmaking is whether this rococo religio-action pic holds together on its own cinematic terms. Lord knows for all the provocation of its bloodlines-of-Jesus subject matter the movie version of The Da Vinci Code fell apart. So half a hallelujah -- this one does work mostly. At least until the end when the climactic Hail Mary plot twist might try the patience of a saint Angels amp; Demons barrels along with a confidence -- and more fundamentally a pulse -- missing from director Ron Howards first encounter with the best-selling novels of Dan Brown. True the new movie is an opulent-bordering-on-hysterical mass of chitchat and chase scenes. Screenwriters David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman pack in highfalutin lectures about art history between gory murders (particularly of men of God) staged with a lust that might challenge a parents faith in PG-13. But at least theres forward movement here an energy focused by the necessity of managing two plotlines of equal urgency Cardinals gathered in Vatican City must elect a new pope following the death of a beloved pontiff. And a ticking time bomb planted by enemies of the church must be found before Rome is blown to kingdom come. As readers are already aware Langdon is brought in to decipher telltale squiggles that turn out to be the marks of the Illuminati an ancient secret brotherhood of wily church haters. (The Vatican hates the Illuminati right back.) Inevitably the characters who surround the professor have been assembled to lead us astray -- to confound our reading of good and evil. Its all the more important then that each costar look impressive against a backdrop of lovingly photographed crypts catacombs and streets. Ewan McGregor favors a fervent pious look as the priest who following the popes death acts as head of Vatican City until a successor is chosen. Stellan Skarsgard exaggerates his sour puss as the grumpy head of the Swiss Guard which is devoted to the popes protection. Settling for one of his reliably deadpan expressions that mean his man could be good bad or both Armin Mueller-Stahl plays Cardinal Strauss a smooth old operator in bright red clergy wear. In contrast theres little doubt about the goodness (and gorgeousness) of Vittoria a smart capable and sexy-but-demure scientist portrayed by Munichs Ayelet Zurer. (Vittorias feminine role is to listen to Langdon explain stuff -- stuff she usually already knows but that the audience needs to learn -- and occasionally to do some light Latin translation.) By the way the charismatic guy you wont take your eyes off the one who plays an assassin is the great young Danish actor Nikolaj Lie Kaas (Open Hearts Brothers) whos due for stardom. Theyre a colorful lot these angelic and demonic players. But thered be no point revisiting Dan Browns Vatican without Hanks Hes reliable and businesslike as Da Vinci Code viewers remember him and he does a nimble impersonation of a resourceful scholar trapped at one point in an airless library. But his greatest trick may be one of humankinds simplest the ability to walk and talk at the same time. Or in this case to tear ass and expound simultaneously on church history without sacrificing speed for intelligibility. By Da Vinci Code standards this counts as a miracle. B?

"movie review angels amp; demons - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Angels amp; Demons -- 3 out of 5 stars Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic There are a several moments of real pathos in Ron Howards film of Dan Browns Angels amp; Demons which is several more than he was able to conjure up in his film of Browns The Da Vinci Code. Howard has made a better more entertaining thriller out of the first book in Browns saga about symbols expert Robert Langdon ( Tom Hanks) and his research into skulduggery entangling the Catholic Church.The director loses ""the girl"" for much of the film and loses his hero for much of the third act. The script tips its hand too early and cant quite turn Langdon into Indiana Langdon on his Last Crusade. But in plumbing the mysteries of the Vatican (which refused to help with the film) the Conclave of Cardinals who elect a new pope the machinery of the Vatican State and the treasures of the Vatican Archive Howard has made a popcorny summer movie that mimics the history-meets-action of those escapist National Treasure movies. This time the threat is directly to the Vatican. Someone has kidnapped four cardinals who are the leading candidates to succeed the just-deceased pope. Someone has just stolen the dangerous byproduct of sciences new cutting edge -- anti-matter created by the new supercollider in Cern Switzerland. Could that ""someone"" be The Illuminati that long-dead secret society of enlightened scientists and thinkers thought exterminated by the Church hundreds of years ago? Are they back and ready for revenge eager to murder cardinals and blow up the Vatican?The late popes right hand priest ( Ewan McGregor) thinks so though the chief of the Swiss Guards ( Stellan Skarsgard) charged with protecting the Holy See is skeptical. They have mere hours to solve a puzzle rescue the cardinals and prevent the destruction of St. Peters and the Vatican. Only the ever-explaining man of science not faith (Langdon) can save ""Saint Peters church at its most vulnerable moment."" They bring along the scientist (Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer) who lost the anti-matter in her search for the ""God particle"" a Holy Grail in physics.Howard builds suspense by intercutting the race to rescue the cardinals with the political machinations of the men selecting a new pope chief among them Cardinal Strauss (Armin Mueller-Stahl). Hanks is more engaged this time and McGregor Skarsgard and Mueller-Stahl give formidable support.The marvels of Angels amp; Demons which is part ""alternate history of the Catholic Church"" and part Roman travelogue is what Ron Howard and his team were able to create without having Vatican cooperation. They shot in Rome but had to fake such settings as the human circus of St. Peters Square when the cardinals go into seclusion to change the direction of the church by picking a new pope; the wonders of a Hollywood version of the Vatican Archive; and crypts passageways basilicas virtually none of which he had access to are vividly realized here. To say nothing of a special-effects version of the Cern supercollider where atoms will be smashed to such tiny bits that as the film suggests science will get a glimpse of ""the moment of creation."" This sequel could have easily just been ""The Galileo Code"" but the screenwriters (Akiva Goldsman and David Koepp) and Howard wrestle a little science fiction and science morality into Angels.Its doesnt quite pay off but Angels amp; Demons does a much better job of balancing the blasphemy and blood heresy and heroics that were Browns ticket to eternal wealth if not eternal life.

Angels amp; Demons Director Ron Howard. Cast Tom Hanks Ewan McGregor Ayelet Zurer. Rating PG-13 for violence disturbing images and thematic material. Great Good Fair Bad Bomb Related Tom Hanks still knows how to make a splash Conspiracy movies Spotlight Tom Hanks Not their faith. Their intelligence and taste in movies. The thriller based on the book Dan Brown wrote before ""The Da Vinci Code"" is fast-paced full of action and utterly implausible. So you say? Isnt ""Star Trek?"" Sure. But it takes place IN SPACE. ""Angels amp; Demons"" meanwhile takes place here on Earth specifically in the Vatican where Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks reprising his ""Da Vinci"" role) who hasnt exactly endeared himself to the church has been called in to help save it. The pope has died so the College of Cardinals is set to elect a new one. This tradition has gone on for centuries. But this time someone has stolen a canister containing newly created antimatter and kidnapped the four cardinals most likely to be elected pope. A threat arrives The cardinals will be branded and publicly executed one each over the next four hours; then an hour later the antimatter will explode taking the Vatican and a good-size chunk of surrounding Rome with it. Enter Langdon evidently the only person on Earth - no church scholars no historians - who can connect the dots to find the cardinals and the canister. Hes helped by a young priest Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor) who was raised by the late pope and scoffed at by Commander Richter (Stellan Skarsgard) of the Swiss Guard the popes security detail. Meanwhile Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer) the scientist working on the antimatter project is on hand to help prevent the antimatter from exploding - if they can find it. This combustible mix of faith and science must be authorities and a skeptical Langdon conclude the work of the Illuminati a group begun in the 17th century were told that recognized science and which the church tried to stamp out. This led the Illuminati underground in the films story where its members have waited for a chance to overthrow the church. It appears that time is now. How do we learn this? Easy if cheap None of the investigators is very well-schooled in this sort of history so Langdon explains it out loud and often to them - and to the audience. (At one point he even chides them about their ignorance. A knowing wink? Lets hope so.) Credit where its due Director Ron Howard also back from ""Da Vinci"" keeps things moving fast enough - the clock is ticking after all - that you dont linger over the implausibility of the story. And the film looks great the religious iconography lovingly shot by director of photography Salvatore Totino. As for the Catholic Church certainly some of its highest-ranking members are imperiled or worse. And while its treatment of scientists like Galileo - himself a Catholic - is talked about the film also portrays the church many times as a force of good. There is discussion of the balance between science and faith and trying to resolve the two something any religion and any scientist for that matter must face eventually. Also theres this Its only a movie. Were snapped back to that by way of the ending elements of which are so ludicrous as to be laughable. None of which will prevent the movie from making a mint. Browns fans are legion. For them enjoying ""Angels amp; Demons"" isnt a possibility. Its a matter of faith. Reach Goodykoontz at 602-444-8974 or bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

But the movie clips along tricked out with state-of-the-art hardware and a hotter brighter partner for Hanks in the race against serial prelate-murder by yet another ancient secret society with evil designs on the Vatican. As the enchantingly alliterative particle physicist Dr. Vittoria Vetra Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer furrows her brow and wrings her hands over the catastrophic danger posed to the Holy See by a stolen canister of something nuclear which she had designed for noble civic use.And thats just the half of it. The incumbent Pope has died his tongue has turned suspiciously black and four of the extremely red cardinals most likely to succeed him have been abducted for medieval branding and/or burning by a wild-eyed predator named ""The Assassin"" (Nikolaj Lie Kaas) whose most attractive quality is that unlike the mad albino Paul Bettany played in Da Vinci hes not into mortifying his own flesh. His rimless glasses bespeak a man of intellect and Langdon tossing off deconstructed signifiers like Roland Barthes on steroids strongly suspects him of membership in the Illuminati a secret society whose fondness for science has drawn the ire of the Catholic Church for hundreds of years.Once again theres much screeching of tires and desperate racing through the underground tunnels of Romes lovelier churches. For what its worth in the three years since he made The Da Vinci Code with time off for the intelligently sedate Frost/Nixon Ron Howard has grown into a more confident director of florid action sequences. Gift-wrapped in production design lifted from The Godfather and a score by Hans Zimmer that sounds like the rumbling tummies of a thousand underfed monks Angels is studded with capably brutal set pieces building to an impressive if ineffably silly bit of business involving a helicopter a parachute and a huge crowd fighting over stem cell research in St. Peters Square.But what of the life of the spirit--even Dan Browns vulgar spirit channeled with dismaying fidelity to his ornate prose by David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman? Will science trump belief or will the two lie down together like lambs? Will Honest Bob the lubricious Dr. V and half the population of Rome be done in by Illuminati unbound or worse by the vicious internal politics of the Vatican? Theres no place for anything so retro as character development in the Brown universe--either youre an angel masquerading as a demon or the other way around. When theyre not getting spectacularly knocked off just about every salient player--from Stellan Skarsgard as head of the Vaticans Swiss Guard to Ewan McGregor as the progressive young papal protege in charge of electing the new Pontiff--waves at the audience to hint that he might be the lone rotten apple in Catholicisms otherwise sound barrel.Brushing away accusations of factual inaccuracy in an interview with Britains Radio Times Hanks gave the movie its most succinct review ""Its not important but its fun."" Evidently the Vatican thought exactly the opposite while Howard was shooting--the director has accused the Church of backroom politicking to deny him access to the gargoyles and frescoes of Rome. To my mind the Holy See got off very lightly. I was dying to ask the two jolly nuns sitting in front of me if they felt insulted but I couldnt tell whether they were actual sisters in Christ or Sony plants in drag designed to show that no offense to the Church was meant or taken or Sacha Baron Cohen plus one.

(Browns dumbed-down Umberto Ecoisms at least had fervor.) For the sequel Angels amp; Demons Howard seems hell-bent on atonementof a sort. He delivers a shapely stylish white-knuckle horror-thriller that hits its marks with blood and thunder. It stinks to heaven too but it isnt lame. The streets of Rome havent run this red since the Inquisition. Tom Hanks is back slimmer and sans bouffant as Robert Langdon the Harvard symbologist turned breathless sleuth. His vigorous swim interrupted Langdon learns that Vatican City is under siege. A liberal Pope has mysteriously croaked; four cardinals have been kidnapped ostensibly by the ancient pro-science sect the Illuminati and are marked to die at hourly intervals; a tube of antimatter stolen from a Swiss supercollider will vaporize the Vatican at midnight; andas if all this werent enougha conclave is meeting behind locked doors to elect a new pontiff and some of the candidates (especially Armin Mueller-Stahl) look awfully shifty. Is Stellan Skarsgard (as the obstructive head of the Swiss Guard) the Illuminati mastermind? Does Ewan McGregors lack of inflection as Camerlengotemporary head of Vatican Citysuggest he has something to hide or is it just his usual lackluster acting? This Church dispenses loaves and red herrings. To save Catholicism Hankss Langdon and Ayelet Zurers comely Italian particle physicist Vittoria Vetra join forces on a furious scavenger hunt from church to square to skull-laden crypt. It was Vetra who isolated the stolen antimatterthe God particleand Langdon is suitably awed Youre talking about the moment of creation. Yes in a way I am. Their exchanges have a comfy sameness. He explains the meaning of a sign she restates what he just said and he says Exactly. Their squealing tires underscored with booming liturgical choirs the pair habitually arrives just in time (an onscreen clock shows 859 959 etc.) for the latest cardinal carnage. About that carnage Angels amp; Demons is rated PG-13 in spite of multiple splattery shootings brandings gouged eyeballs and close-ups of holy men writhing in flames. Of course theres no nudity. Also the Lords name is never taken in vain at least in the sense of George Carlin words-you-cant-say-on-TV. In fact God is invoked as the reason for Langdons presence Despite the symbologists professed lack of faith it is Langdon the academic who protects the Catholic Church from loony fanatics. There has been a lot of noise about Browns supposed anti-Catholicismtalk of boycotts scholarly denunciations. Thats surprising. With atheists out of the closet and Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens anchoring the best-seller lists Browns scriptural cliffhangers put him squarely on the side of the angels. (Even if he were on the side of the demons at least he believes they exist.)
