Instead one is bored and stupefied by what seems like an eternity of vacuous spectacle cod-Buddhist tosh and clunking dialogue. Even more embarrassing than the risible Lady in the Water this wildly misjudged farrago is portentous but never profound laughable but not remotely funny and action-packed without ever being exciting - all in fuzzy retro-fitted 3D. Having been awol for 100 years - during which time the world was thrown out of balance (yawn) and the bellicose Fire Nation conquered the peaceful Southern Water Tribe with their fearsome war machines - the shaven-headed Aang (Noah Ringer) is released from a sphere of ice by two Water Tribe children Katara (Nicola Peltz) and her older brother Sokka (Jackson Rathbone). It looks like Aang may be the mythical Avatar the only being who can control all four elements Earth Fire Water and Air. Various interested parties including the Fire Nations vengeful exiled Prince Zuko (Dev Patel) are determined to harness or suppress the Avatars powers. A series of confusing adventures explosive battles and vaguely spiritual confrontations follows while giant furry creatures float in the air talking dragon spirits offer sage advice and the moon turns red with shame. Devotees of the original Nickleodeon animated TV series swear this film adaptation is a travesty of its meaningful allegorical themes - but most of them were aged between six and 12 when they first saw it. Either way if your actual or mental  age exceeds this steer well clear.

Everything about this movie is terrible But really if you havent seen the show then dont say anything about it The show deals with serious issues such as child abuse animal abuse murder war etc. The show challenges kids makes them think and kids (without knowing it) like it So beofore you make a statement about something make sure you actually know something about it ;)FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 18 2013J DruonFeaturedtotally agree with the guy below... |FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 21 2013AerieFeaturedI guess youve never even tried to watch an episode of the show from your review. I fully agree that the movie was flat and boring. It took none of the comedic humor of the original show but it also failed to pick up the tact the original had with more serious issues. Genocide and xenophobic nationalism. The deaths of friends and loved ones. Political upheaval brainwash torture and growing into your own person. We watched the gaang grow up. The dialogue between the characters was believeable and you truly felt for the characters especially Zuko the anti-hero of the series. Zuko in particular was very fun to watch. We met him as a boy who was angry with the world obsessed with ""reclaiming his honor."" And it wasnt until much later that we learned what that meant. He became increasingly more sympathetic and his roll as the blue spirit was intriguing. His sister made for an excellent villain and brought up another dark point of the story as she was most definitely a borderline psychopath. The live action movie however was a disaster. I felt nothing for any of the other characters....it was bad enough that they mispronounced Aang. I didnt feel the impact of even Yues death in this version which actually brought home the idea that people were going to die in this war and not always the bad ones either. The effects were the only thing that was even ever so slightly decent. In the end the movie failed to even give the characters the same personalities. There was no humor in a story that has some of the funniest things Ive ever seen in the cartoon. It deserves maybe a half a stat whereas the original was at least an 8 if not a 9/10. With the only problem I had being the somewhat forced feeling to some of the pairings and the occasional cheesy episode that had me rolling my eyes. (Looking at you Avatar Day and parts of Tales of Ba Sing Se) Honestly though if you really think this series is completely childish though try doing a little more research before you blab and looking at the Di Lee or Princess Azulas story.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 11 2010raihanFeaturedthis film is cool i liked the footage its like its real its the best film ever and at last the best one of seenFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 11 2010raihanFeaturedthis film is cool i liked the footage its like its real its the best film ever and at last the best one of seenFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 7 2010BobbyFeaturedIm 23 and I really like the animated series. Okay the big plot was somewhat cheesy but the episodes and sub-stories were very good. Plus it had lots of humor. The movie however was a big let-down. I was almost ashamed when I walked out of the theathre that I went to see such a shallow and childish movie.

amyweekly >> Blog Archive >> The Last Airbender amyweekly Amy Nicholsons reviews and interviews << The Twilight Saga Eclipse [REC] 2 >> The Last Airbender Ask a Nickelodeon-obsessed tween and theyll tell you that a Bender is someone who can control an element. Benders specialize in fire earth air and water and in this swishy Asiatic playground Fire Benders bully the rest into submission. Call director M. Night Shyamalan a Wood Bender; this kiddie cast is as flat and stiff as particle board and Shyamalan used up all his attention span for actors in The Sixth Sense. There he bothered to guide Haley Joel Osmont to act. Here star Noah Ringer is just fodder for the CGI wood chipper; hes a set piece to waste time between battles. Not that the expository workman dialogue Shyamalan writes is worth the paper its written on. The flick pulls off the feat of being both over-explanatory and confusing--its like an encyclopedia on fast-forward. Shyamalan doesnt trust the human element. Were told how characters feel that a water warrior (Jackson Rathbone) and a water princess (Seychelle Gabriel) have just fallen in love without letting them generate any hot steam. Still if you must see it as a baby-sitter dont spring to see it in 3D. Its like watching 2D with glasses. And as the film itself proves you shouldnt mix elements.

A chronic illness that worsens and worsens without ever quite proving terminal? A night out on the town with Lindsay Lohan?Its hard work coming up with a metaphor equal to the task of describing the precipitous cinematic decline of M. Night Shyamalan. The writer-directors career over the last dozen years has been like an exercise in entropy from the critical and commercial success of The Sixth Sense; to the underrated Unbreakable; to the bold but ill-conceived Signs; to the escalating idiocies of The Village; to the risible Lady in the Water (a failure notable enough to occasion an entire book); to The Happening a picture so terrible that it defied conventional criticism. Having evidently run out of filmable ideas of his own Shyamalan has now turned to an adaptation of Nickelodeons animated series ""Avatar The Last Airbender."" (The movie borrows the latter half of the shows title the former being otherwise engaged.) At first the project seemed to promise an experiment of sorts Has Shyamalan truly emerged as one of Hollywoods most awful directors or merely one of its most awful screenwriters? Alas the experiment was corrupted by the studios decision to let Shyamalan write his own script so it is impossible to determine the precise origin of the awfulness. But rest assured its there.The story such as it is follows Aang (Noah Ringer) a bald tattooed boy-mystic who is found packed in an ice bubble one snowy morning by siblings Katara (Nicola Peltz) and Sokka (Jackson Rathbone). Katara and Sokka we learn belong to the Water Nation some of whose members (Katara among them) can manipulate ice and water with their minds; Aang meanwhile is the last survivor of the Air Nation (no relation to the Aryan Nation tattoos and baldness notwithstanding). All three have suffered at the hands of the Fire Nation which bullies the Water folk and has eradicated all of Aangs people save him. Aang as it happens is the Avatar the sole being in the world with the power to manipulate all four elements (air water fire and earth). Unfortunately his Avatar training was cut short before hed learned to manipulate anything other than air. So he spends the duration of the film hanging out with tribes of the Water Nation learning to use their element and overcoming various attempts at kidnapping or invasion by competing Fire Nation bands led by ambitious Commander Zhao (Aasif Mandvi) and exiled Prince Zuko (Dev Patel looking decidedly cranky at the wrong turn his career has taken since Slumdog Millionaire). Its a remarkably flat arc though tolerable movies have been made from less. But I think its fair to say that none of those movies boasted quite the array of leaden performances overscripted dialogue narrative inertia and underwhelming visual effects that characterize The Last Airbender. This is a film that resembles a video game in all the bad ways--Manichean premise non-existent characterization an obsession with dutifully explained ""rules""--while still managing to miss out on the kinetic momentum of Xboxiness. If there has been a duller more stagnant action film released this decade I managed thank God to miss it.The movie is narrated intermittently by Katara though she need hardly have bothered Nearly every character self-narrates with redundant promiscuity announcing what he intends to do then describing what he is in the midst of doing and finally recounting what he has just done. (Shyamalan evidently worries that a large proportion of his audience will suffer from deficient memories and/or restless bladders.) Indeed the film works so hard to explain its plot developments that it scarcely has any time left over to dramatize them. Exposition has not merely vanquished mimesis it has burned its homes to the ground and sown salt in its fields. Saddled with such stubbornly instrumental dialogue it is little surprise that Shyamalans castmembers creak listlessly through their lines. Yet it is nonetheless an accomplishment of sorts that not a single character in the entire film manages to establish an identity discrete from his or her narrative obligations. (Checkers have more individuality.) When a secondary heroine decides to sacrifice her life for the greater good--shortly after meeting cute with the boy of her dreams--her martyrdom has all the moral and emotional gravity of a popping soap bubble.If one might hope for a single courtesy from The Last Airbender it would be that it live up to the promise of its title and forswear any future installments. Alas in a coda scene--perhaps the most ham-fisted sequel-primer since Harry Osborne found his dads secret Goblin closet at the end of Spider-Man 2--Shyamalan emphatically announces that this is not his intent. The leader of the Fire Nation (Cliff Curtis) ploddingly explains that Aang having now learned to manipulate water will doubtless follow by training in earth and fire and assigns a new agent to deter him. I mean it as no reflection on this agents capabilities when I say that she is almost certainly not up to the task. No one I fear can bring Aangs tiresome odyssey to a close save you the discerning moviegoer. I pray that you act accordingly.

Twitter previousSalmon Extravaganza Part InextThe Trouble With Harry Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

After Khizr Khan spoke politicians and commentators on most networks said they were moved humbled inspired choked up.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

Photo Zandy Mangold If M. Night Shyamalan sold his soul to the devil for the success of ""The Sixth Sense"" I think His Satanic Majesty has finally collected in full with ""The Last Airbender"" the writer-directors mind-numbingly dreadful live-action adaptation of a popular animated TV series. Shyamalan whose films have gotten progressively worse over the past decade finally hits rock bottom here -- stilted dialogue wooden acting glacial pacing cheesy special effects tacky-looking sets ugly costumes poorly staged and edited action sequences all shown in murky cut-rate 3-D. This fiasco has deservedly generated advance criticism for hiring Caucasian actors to play leads that were portrayed as Asians in the TV show and pitting them against darker-skinned bad guys. But thats only the beginning of the problems with this utterly misconceived fantasy which is reported to have cost about 150 million. For that kind of money actors who re-record dialogue should at least be required to match their mouth movements. And the movie should be more than marginally coherent for those unfamiliar with the Nickelodeon series. (Tweets suggest its fans at early screenings hate the movie.) The film revolves around Aang (Noah Ringer) a 12-year-old whos thawed out after spending nearly a century in a glacier (audiences may feel the same way at the end of the movie). The last in a long-ago slaughtered race of airbenders -- he can use air as a weapon -- Aang is also the latest in a long line of dalai lama-esque avatars charged with ""bringing balance"" to the world. But first Aang has to learn how to also bend water earth and fire as weapons -- and stop the firebenders who killed the other airbenders from destroying the waterbenders as well. Or something like that. This basic story line was played out over the TV series first season -- the couple of episodes I watched had an offbeat charm -- but in Shyamalans inept hands its easily the worst of the many overplotted would-be fantasy franchises launched in the wake of ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Harry Potter."" Not helping matters at all are Aangs teenage companions on the quest a waterbender played by Nicola Peltz and her hunky brother (Jackson Rathbone also featured in ""The Twilight Saga Eclipse"") who look like they escaped from a road company of ""The Chronicles of Narnia."" The evil firebenders are led by poor Cliff Curtis who repeatedly has to remind his minions not to kill Aang because ""hell just be reincarnated."" The biggest name in the cast the wonderful Dev Patel of ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is perfectly awful and looks miserable as Curtis whiny son -- something for which I think we have to give Shyamalan special credit. It all anticlimaxes with a boring confusingly filmed attack on a city of waterbenders -- and the hunks ho-hum doomed romance with an insipid local princess we barely get to meet. Theres also a promise of at least two sequels that I feel fairly certain will never get made.

Media San Francisco Chronicle The Last Airbender Action fantasy. Starring Noah Ringer Dev Patel Nicola Peltz and Jackson Rathbone. Directed by M. Night Shyamalan. (PG. 103 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) After spending the past decade making bad movies writer-director M. Night Shyamalan has branched out in ""The Last Airbender."" He has made a really bad movie. To be specific he has made a dull boring poorly acted limply written and thoroughly unappealing fantasy featuring bland characters locked in a struggle of no interest. Whats more his film doesnt derail. Its off track from its first seconds from an opening scroll thats confusing to a first scene showing two teenagers walking along a frozen landscape spouting pure exposition. And then - oh no - the two young people are suddenly in danger Now this is amazing Shyamalan gives us two characters without a hint of charm without anything that might kindle even a spark of human sympathy and then he expects us to care that theyre in trouble. But really its the audience whos in trouble. Five minutes in and already theres no hope. The film based on a Nickelodeon animated television series presents a fantasy in which each of the four elements - air water earth and fire - has its own principality or kingdom. Within each kingdom - are you still interested? Youre still reading this right? - there are people who can control a given element through force of mind. For example a firebender can throw fireballs an airbender can harness the wind and a waterbender can cover someone with ice. And dont forget those earthbenders who can throw rocks just by thinking about it.

(Courtesy Zade Rosenthal/MCT) Photo Handout MCT Review 3-D Last Airbender has no dimension 1 / 1 Back to Gallery That could be useful. Anyway as ""The Last Airbender"" begins the fire people are taking over the world and making everybody miserable. But theres one thing that can stop them a little boy named Aang (Noah Ringer) who has the potential to bend all four elements. Accordingly the evil fire people want to capture him and the non-fire people want to nurture him. And that is the premise and catalyst for 103 minutes of fire flinging and endless earnest conversation ""And it is in the heart that all battles are won ..."" Along the way Shyamalan employs voiceover narration to advance the story and each time he does he creates confusion. Early in the film someone rushes into a hut and announces portentously ""The Fire Nation is here and theyve brought their machines."" This would lead one to expect that were about to find out something about their machines - as in what are they. Bad guess. The movie is in 3-D and its the worst use of 3-D in the modern era. Its unimaginative not eye-catching and ends up actually emphasizing the fakeness of the effects and the landscape. For example say you have two people in the foreground walking through an ice-covered terrain. To create a visual effect whereby the eye lifts out those two figures ends up calling our attention to the artifice - that these are two actors walking against a blue screen and that the snow ice and glaciers are all computer-generated. The cast is mostly made up of unknowns - Dev Patel from ""Slumdog Millionaire"" as the downcast fire Prince is the biggest name here. Using unknowns presents an opportunity to discover talent but the young people here make the kids in the ""Twilight"" movies look like scintillating wits. Noah Ringer as the title character just seems like a nice bald child. Nicola Peltz as the last waterbender barely registers and Jackson Rathbone as her brother keeps spitting out his lines with tension in his voice and his eyes bugging. They needed help from their director but Shyamalan is incapable of guiding them. Scenes are shapeless without punch and usually without point. He doesnt seem to know much about acting. He doesnt seem to know much about drama. Eleven years ago Shyamalans ""The Sixth Sense"" looked like the beginning of a brilliant career. Today it looks like a fantastic anomaly like a flowerbed in an arid wasteland or some eighth wonder of the world. Supposedly ""The Last Airbender"" is the beginning of a trilogy and there will be another in late 2011 and yet another in 2014. But trilogies have a way of not happening when the first installment is worthless. Something tells me that with ""The Last Airbender"" well have seen the last airbender. -- Advisory Kids may fall asleep and then have trouble getting to bed later that night.

Summit Entertainment By Joe Morgenstern Updated July 9 2010 1201 a.m. ET Youd never guess what the best part of ""The Twilight Saga Eclipse"" proves to be. It isnt blood-sucking monsters doing their thing though theres some of that to feed the franchise and its definitely not vampires and werewolves having at each other in a cosmic showdown. No this not-bad tale comes to its fullest flower one night during a wintry storm inside a tent when a shivering Bella is attended by her two newly solicitous and darned near all-American beaux. Edward who plays for the vampire team isnt the right one to raise her body temperature so he defers to Jacob who plays for the werewolves and then the two suitors have a civilized discussion about whos really right for her. I cant pretend that the third episode instilled a fever in my blood but it didnt leave me cold. For the first time in the series I felt Id seen a real movie. Watch a scene from The Twilight Saga Eclipse starring Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson. Video courtesy of Summit Entertainment. The cast and main characters remain the same Kristen Stewart as the endlessly conflicted Bella; Robert Pattinson as earnest Edward who like the film as a whole takes himself less seriously this time around (""If we werent natural enemies and you werent trying to steal the reason for my existence"" he tells his rival with something resembling a grin ""I might actually like you""); and Taylor Lautners ever-buff Jacob who does own shirts but wears them as seldom as possible. The performances havent changed much either. Ms. Stewart still has trouble conveying feelings and speaking clearly--maybe that reflects Bellas problems with thinking clearly--even when she makes such straightforward statements as ""Gosh its so pretty here."" Read More Eclipse Breaks Record for Wednesday Opening Not that the tweenage fans of these movies need to see Bella as a poster girl for elocution. They see her as they see themselves frightened of romance and yearning for it in equal measure. (To make matters more fearful as well as exciting Bellas high school graduation is at hand.) And theyll be gratified this time to find her the recipient of doubly loving attention since what has changed significantly is the regional dynamic. A gang of young out-of-control vampires has been terrorizing Seattle and having passed around the heroines scent is headed for bucolic Forks. Before they arrive Edwards family and Jacobs lupine tribe strike up a temporary alliance to keep Bella safe. ENLARGE Left also in Eclipse Xavier Samuel in front as the villainous Riley. Summit Entertainment If some of this makes ""Eclipse"" sound talkier than it is (i.e. quite talky and sometimes pleasantly so) the production under David Slades workmanlike direction takes several time-outs--or time-ins depending on your bloodlust level--for bluntly efficient if familiar battles. (In that department only the wolves have been changed; they seem to have more personality than before.) Bellas police-chief father Charlie (Billy Burke) gets sympathetic laughs when he tries to protect his daughter by grounding her. How little he knows like so many fathers of adventurous girls about how much the ground is shifting beneath her. Watch a scene from The Last Airbender a film directed by M. Night Shyamalan. Video courtesy of Paramount Pictures. The Last Airbender Never mind that the little kid flapping his arms to whip up the waves in ""The Last Airbender"" suggests a pouty-faced version of Mickey Mouse as the Sorcerers Apprentice. Or that the movie looks no worse if you take off your 3-D glasses. (It looks better only if you close your eyes.) Or that the default color is murky purple just as the default mood is morose. Or that M. Night Shyamalans big-screen live-action version of the popular Nickelodeon animated TV series constitutes a form of Chinese water torture in which tin-ear line-readings take the place of drips. Theres a serious mystery here and it extends to the highest levels of Hollywoods decision-makers. Why did any studio executives think the results might be better? The filmmaker has delivered yet another iteration of what has become a classic M. Night Shyamalan film only much bigger than before and as a consequence mind-bendingly turgid. Before exploring that mystery let me try to convey a bit more of ""Airbenders"" awfulness. The young hero of the title a long-lost and long-awaited avatar named Aang is played by a 12-year-old newcomer named Noah Ringer. According to Mr. Ringers understandably slim curriculum vitae he holds a first-degree black belt in taekwondo. To judge from an informal interview posted on YouTube he is extremely personable lively and humorous when hes off screen. On screen alas he is none of those things thanks to the reverse wizardry of his director. (No one else can be blamed when an actor has had no professional experience.) Its painful to watch him struggling with his banal lines or doing nutty dances to augment the water-bending effect of all those arm flaps. ENLARGE Noah Ringer inThe Last Airbender. Industrial Light amp; Magic His lines are no more banal than those of the bad guys chasing him; they are portrayed in descending order of badness by Aasif Mandvi Cliff Curtis and Dev Patel. All three play their characters as steady-state scowlers so their scenes keep yielding little howlers. (Though Im not so sure about Mr. Mandvi a regular on ""The Daily Show With Jon Stewart""; his scowls and growls seem like variants of winks and nods.) The producers have been widely criticized for failing to cast the Asian characters of the original with Asian actors and the criticism is valid notwithstanding the presence of Asians in minor roles. Like the hero Aang the lead characters of the brave sister and brother Katara and Sokka are played by young and conspicuously Caucasian American actors--Nicola Peltz and Jackson Rathbone (who also plays the ""Twilight"" vampire Jasper Hale). But where does criticism end when a production is botched from start to finish? All of which brings us back to the question of expectations and how Mr. Shyamalan keeps getting work. Eleven years ago he electrified the movie world with the emotional power and dramatic surprise of ""The Sixth Sense."" He followed up with two flawed but intriguing features ""Unbreakable"" and ""Signs."" In the past eight years though his oeuvre has gone from bad (""The Village"") to worse (""Lady in the Water"") to worst (""The Happening."") Purists might argue that his last film was less dreadful than his penultimate one but the hallmarks were the same stilted language robotized acting glacial pace ponderous style dramatic ineptitude and negligible energy. I never meant to make this review an exercise in career assassination but I cant help thinking of all the lavishly talented filmmakers who have earned and never gotten a shot at big-budget success. Whats the secret of this guys failure? DVD FOCUS ENLARGE Irma Vep (1996) The matchless Maggie Cheung plays a version of herself--a Hong Kong martial-arts star who speaks no French--in Olivier Assayass marvelous French-language film about the perils of filmmaking and not incidentally vampires. Jean-Pierre Leaud (the star of so many classic New Wave films by Messrs. Truffaut and Godard) is Rene Vidal a New Wave director who wants to keep from being completely washed up by remaking the silent serial ""Les Vampires"" with Ms. Cheung as his leading lady. The film already available through Netflix on DVD went online yesterday as a Netflix streaming download. ENLARGE Wolfen (1981) The attraction here is the great English actor Albert Finney as Dewey Wilson an alcoholic police captain on the trail of a pack of superwolves terrorizing New York City. (No they dont deal in derivatives by day.) Two other werewolf movies came out the same year ""The Howling"" and ""An American Werewolf In London"" but this is the one with smarts and a strong bite. Gerry Fisher was the cinematographer. The cast includes Gregory Hines Diane Venora Edward James Olmos and Tom Noonan. Its the only fiction film directed by Michael Wadleigh who did the 1970 documentary ""Woodstock."" ENLARGE Slumdog Millionaire (2008) Part of the fun of picking these DVD picks is finding worthwhile films that have been forgotten or are edging toward obscurity. Thats hardly the case with Danny Boyles recent Oscar-winning romantic fable set in contemporary Mumbai the former Bombay. But its instructive to see what the same actor Dev Patel was able to do for the endlessly exuberant Mr. Boyle and what he was induced or very possibly doomed to do in ""The Last Airbender"" for M. Night Shyamalan who was born in India but brought up in suburban Philadelphia. Its the difference between radiant day and gloomy Night. --Joe Morgenstern Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

For the past few weeks you and your allies in ethnic correctness have clogged the blogosphere with complaints about the casting in M. Night Shyamalans live-action movie version of the Nickelodeon animated series Avatar The Last Airbender. Yes the main villain roles among the rapacious Fire People are played by men of Indian descent (as is Shyamalan). Yes Aang the shows Chinese hero is played by a Caucasian boy named Noah Ringer; and two other pasty white kids Nicola Peltz and Jackson Rathbone were chosen to impersonate Aangs main pals Katara and Sokka. Actually the actors who voice the Asian roles in the TV series are Caucasian too -- but never mind that because yes again its a shame the films producers couldnt find suitable Chinese youngsters among the 500 million or so on earth. You can relax bloggers. The dearth of racially appropriate casting in the U.S. simply means that fewer Asians were humiliated by appearing in what is surely the worst botch of a fantasy epic since Ralph Bakshis animated desecration of The Lord of the Rings back in 1978. The actors who didnt get to be in The Last Airbender are like the passengers who arrived too late to catch the final flight of the Hindenburg. (See the top 10 Disney controversies.) Oh the humanity Where is it in this movie? The lack of vitality and even surface plausibility numbs the senses. Actors wander through sets speak their lines and battle computer-generated beasts without ever convincing the viewer that they are the characters theyre playing let alone that these characters are worth investing an evening in. Shyamalan and his team have devised a fantasy environment thats both bland and murky; its not a world that rewards the search for visual grandeur or eccentricity. The dialogue he wrote has the stilted sagacity of a fortune-cookie dictum; after each line is delivered you may be tempted to shout out ""In bed"" The movies lavish scale is matched by its amateur-hour naivete -- as if a Wall Street plutocrat had spent millions on a monumental pageant for his 10-year-old daughters birthday party then staged it himself on his country estate and invited his neighbors and their kids to play the leads. (Shyamalan shot most of this 150 million movie near his suburban Philadelphia home; its the most expensive film ever made in the Philly area.) (See Techlands Qamp;A with M. Night Shyamalan.) Like its source TV show dreamed up by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko Airbender posits a world divided into four nations by its elements Earth Air Water and Fire. The planet manages a certain harmony because each group has strengths -- ""bending"" capabilities -- that counter those of the others. (Is there another planet where the ruling tribes are Rock Paper and Scissors?) But lately the Fire People have made war on the others whose only hope is in the prophecy of a savior an avatar who has mastered all four elements. That would be Aang a child with a sacred blue arrow tattooed on his bald scalp. One problem though ages ago back in Messiah school he played hooky during the earth- wind- and fire-bending classes. He must learn these skills quickly before Prince Zuko the Fireboy (Dev Patel of Slumdog Millionaire) and his devious adviser Commander Zhao (Aasif Mandvi senior Asian correspondent on The Daily Show) dare I say Rule the World. Insert evil laugh here. One word in the TV shows title -- Avatar -- reminds you by its absence what The Last Airbender is missing. Shyamalan has none of James Camerons gift for building a cohesive compelling fantasy from scratch. Camerons Avatar has a density of imagination suggesting that the filmmakers thought out every aspect of Pandora within the audiences field of vision and beyond it. Airbender settles for a limited vision and stodgy attitude. The promise of fabulous martial-arts scenes goes unrealized; theres no great kung-fu fighting here. It happens that Ringer is the junior tae kwon do champion of Texas but the movie uses his athleticism mainly to strike balletic poses as if he wants to be not the Karate Kid but Billy Elliot. (See the top 10 movie franchises that wont die.) Ringer despite eerily resembling a pint-size version of TIME book critic and fantasy author Lev Grossman is utterly bereft of charisma. Hes the inert center of a dead movie. But then good actors often give subpar performances in Shyamalan films (Sigourney Weaver in The Village Paul Giamatti in Lady in the Water Zooey Deschanel in The Happening) making me suspect the fault is with the director. Maybe he needed stars like Bruce Willis (in The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable) and Mel Gibson (in Signs) to link their gravitas to his solemnity. That was always Shyamalans distinction in a terminally frivolous era hes just about the last serious guy making Hollywood-style movies. ""For me"" he told TIMEs Desa Philadelphia in 2004 ""the challenge is taking a B-movie subject like ghosts or aliens or monsters in the woods and treating it with absolute respect and sincerity."" In The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable he wedded that sincerity to a classically austere camera style that helped those early fables of bereavement weave canny spells over the mass audience. But whatever knack he had he has misplaced as the level of his movies achievement has declined from spot-on to near miss to incompetent and clueless. In his first film adaptation -- his most expensive project by far -- Shyamalan has hit paper-scissors-rock bottom and the promise of a sequel at this movies end feels more like a threat. Please Hollywood if theres to be another Airbender movie hand the job to some efficient hack and not to a once mesmerizing artist whos lost his way. See the 100 best movies of all time.

I wasnt a big fan of ""Avatar"" but its ""Citizen Kane"" compared with M. Night Shyamalans ""The Last Airbender"" based on the animated series ""Avatar The Last Airbender.""Whats an airbender you say? Dont ask. It has something to do with being able to bend air. Aang (Noah Ringer) is the prophesied airbender who must defend his people against the Fire Nation in its quest to dominate the tribal nations of Air Water and Earth.This means we get to see a lot of airbending and also mucho water fire and earth bending. In cheesy 3-D. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Shyamalan has been coasting on the success of ""The Sixth Sense"" for a long time now but especially after his last two debacles ""Lady in the Water"" and ""The Happening"" you would think hed can the hocus-pocus and settle into something a bit more well lucid. ""The Last Airbender"" is like a Care Bears movie that got waylaid in the fourth dimension. Its insufferably silly. Grade D (Rated PG for fantasy action and violence.)

Comments (9) The Last Airbender Video Rated PG  103 minutes  2010 The current national priorities should be as follows reduce carbon emissions and stop funding the films of M. Night Shyamalan. Based on a Japanese animated fantasy series that was successfully programmed by Nickelodeon this live-action feature bears the combined hallmarks of Shyamalans recent output (Lady in the Water The Happening) endless expository dialog and perfect incomprehensibility. In any case theres this little bald kid (Noah Ringer) who can ""bend air"" and his gift has messianic implications in a mystical universe where other folks can also ""bend"" various other elements.

Night Shyamalans Last Airbender Tuesday June 29 2010 at 4 a.m. By Robert Wilonsky 1 A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - While the message boards continue to fume with charges of racism aimed at writer-director M. Night Shyamalan for changing cartoon characters from Asian to Caucasian (except the villains) lets pursue a less arguable crime--that of lousy filmmaking. Adapted from a Nickelodeon cartoon about a young boy whos part Luke Skywalker part Neo and all heroic hodgepodge this is one muddled attempt at franchise-making confusing drab sluggish. (Ugly too if youre forced to see it in 3-D.) Aang (Noah Ringer) is the boy savior who disappeared 100 years ago and took with him the power to ya know bend air--which is to say manufacture poorly computer-generated gusts of wind after performing what appears to be capoeira. Aang was frozen somehow in a ball of ice beneath a pond and in his absence the Fire Benders (led by Daily Show correspondent Aasif Mandvi as the main--and hilarious--baddie) have seized control of the planet and banished the Earth Benders and Water Benders to ghettos. Aang naturally will liberate them if only he can learn how to use The Force . . . or the Matrix . . . or something? Perhaps followers of the series will be more forgiving; this installment--with a sequel-teasing final scene that feels awfully desperate--is written entirely in fanboy shorthand. But to those of us who lose patience quickly with blurry poorly acted clunky kung-fu movies The Last Airbender appears to have been shot using stereo instructions. Worse still This could have been directed by anyone. Or no one.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Jul. 01 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The Last Airbender Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan Starring Noah Ringer Nicola Peltz and Dev Patel Classification PG After his breakthrough with The Sixth Sense in 1999 M. Night Shyamalans career has been painful to contemplate. Hailed as the new Spielberg he has made five movies ranging from the awkward-but-promising ( Signs) to the ridiculous ( Lady in the Water). Never content to be a conventional hack Shyamalan shows auteurist ambitions in his films with themes of grief and loss of faith when supernatural agencies intrude in ordinary lives. The Last Airbender has been touted as a change of direction. With a hefty 150-million (U.S.) budget it is offered as the first film in a blockbuster trilogy. The movie is adapted from Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzkos well-regarded Nickelodeon animated television series Avatar The Last Airbender which draws inspiration from various Asian cultures and takes place in a world with four nations named after the elements of earth water air and fire. Each nation produces a few special individuals who can ""bend"" their elements telekinetically - throwing fire causing whirlwinds moulding rocks or turning water into waves. But only one individual a reincarnated Dalai Lama-like Avatar can manipulate all the elements to maintain peace. As we start the story (shot initially on the snowy landscape of Greenland) an adolescent girl Katara (Nicola Peltz) and her teenaged brother Sokka (Jackson Rathbone) are out hunting seal when they find a glowing globe under the ice. Inside it are a giant flying bison and a 12-year-old boy in what appear to be Tibetan monk robes. The boy (Noah Ringer) introduces himself as Aang and eventually as the legendary Avatar who has been missing for the past century after running away from his monastic school. In his absence the elements have gone out of balance as the Fire Nation has launched a war against the other tribes. Now the children must unite to save the world and put the elements back in harmony. Shyamalan ran into his first controversy while the film was still in production by using Caucasian actors to play most of the characters who were in the original apparently either cartoon Asians or Inuit. Actors of other ethnicities play background roles. The exception is the war-like Fire Nation which is populated by people played by darker-skinned actors including Cliff Curtis (Maori) Shaun Toub (Iranian) and two actors of Indian origin Dev Patel ( Slumdog Millionaire) and a miscast Aasif Mandvi (from Jon Stewarts The Daily Show) as a seething Fire Nation general. The puzzle of Shyamalans racial casting soon becomes secondary to a much more pressing concern - trying to follow the cluttered story. Like Clash of the Titans The Last Airbender was upgraded to 3-D to cash in on the post- Avatar trend and it offers some visual pleasures The Fire Nations gnarly war ships suggest giant witches shoes and the way the water particles shimmer and congeal is the first half-dozen times lovely. The story is a much more serious problem a run-on overstuffed narrative that feels like a very long prologue for a climax that never comes. Characters have little chance to develop between the clots of exposition and Shyamalans mediocre action sequences dont add much to the emotional engagement. Repeatedly characters perform slow-motion tai chi moves before hurling balls of fire walls of earth and waves of water at each other like some overblown game of rock paper scissors. The young actors are often forced to stand delivering long strings of exposition as we learn more information about the spirit world that lies beneath this one about Aangs background about trouble at the Fire Nation court. Aang is kidnapped initially by Prince Zuko (Dev Patel) the estranged prince of the Fire Nation who wants to impress his father and win back his place as future leader. His ally is the sympathetic uncle General Iroh (Toub). After that Katara and Sokka assist Aang and take a crash course of element-bending with the worlds top experts. Along the way Sokka falls in love with Northern Water People Princess Yue (Seychelle Gabriel) who has her own backstory about the Moon Spirit and her special relationship to spiritual carp she keeps in a cavern pool. While meditating in the cavern Aang visits a baritone-voiced spirit dragon who advises him that he must deal with his grief issues and let his ""emotions flow like water."" This is a familiar problem with Shyamalan. When he attempts to dive deep philosophically he comes back with a pearl of triteness. Though his pop-therapy messages have worked spectacularly at the box office in the past at this point The Last Airbender looks less like a career change than another bead in the directors chain of odd disappointments.

BOTTOM LINE The years first complete flop Incoherent unimaginative and dull. CAST Noah Ringer Dev Patel Nicola Peltz Jackson Rathbone LENGTH 144 What happened? The question applies not only to the incomprehensible narrative of ""The Last Airbender"" M. Night Shyamalans entry into the tween-fantasy genre but to the whole project. Its rare to see a film so choppily edited poorly scripted and spastically directed that you can barely understand what youre watching. Based on the animated Nickelodeon series ""Avatar The Last Airbender"" the film marks the first time Shyamalan (""The Happening"") has directed and written someone elses material. It shows. He seems overwhelmed almost irritated by the complexities and minutiae of a world he didnt create. He doesnt love it as his own. advertisement | advertise on newsday ""Airbender"" follows Aang (Noah Ringer) a boy with mystical powers who must unite four tribes - Air Water Earth and Fire - by learning to ""bend"" each element in battle. Aang is pursued by a merciless general (Aasif Mandvi) and a disgraced prince (Dev Patel) but also befriends a brother and sister (Jackson Rathbone and Nicola Peltz) who will help fulfill his destiny. None of this comes to life on the screen. The action scenes - the usual mix of martial arts and special effects - are slow and graceless and the postproduction 3-D only makes them looks flatter. Often Shyamalan doesnt even bother with filmmaking but instead resorts to big mouthfuls of explanatory dialogue. These are equally graceless ""Aang the Fire Nation knew the Avatar would be born to the Air Nomads. So they exterminated all the Air Nomads."" Like it?

Based on the TV cartoon ""Avatar The Last Airbender"" M. Night Shyamalans live-action feature - the first in a planned trilogy - boasts youthful martial-arts heroes who can control the elements in their battle against evil. Starring Noah Ringer Nicola Peltz Dev Patel Jackson Rathbone Shaun Toub Aasif Mandvi Cliff Curtis Seychelle Gabriel Katharine Houghton Director M. Night Shyamalan Running time 143 Release Opened Jul 1 2010  Editorial Review Movie review of The Last Airbender By Michael OSullivan Thursday July 1 2010 Ive been getting e-mails for weeks complaining about the casting of ""The Last Airbender"" director M. Night Shyamalans live-action adaptation of the Nickelodeon cartoon ""Avatar The Last Airbender."" The writers are upset that most of the actors with the exception of British-born Indian actor Dev Patel who plays bad guy Zuko are white. They should be upset with the casting but not for the reason they think. Newcomer Noah Ringer who plays the title role of Aang a messianic child with the power to manipulate the elements is woefully miscast. Not because hes white but because the kid cant act . Embarrassingly amateurish he gives new meaning to the term lightweight and it has nothing to do with his characters ability to float on air. Playing a hero whos meant to be something akin to the young Dalai Lama Ringer brings less than zero gravitas to the role. He makes the kid who plays Gibby on ""iCarly"" look like Sir Laurence Olivier. Aang has run away from the monastery where he was being groomed for his role before he had mastered control of water earth and fire. So its almost plausible that he comes across as such a neophyte. Making matters worse are Ringers young castmates. Playing Katara and Sokka Nicola Peltz and Jackson Rathbone are stiff and awkward. Short of a screen test its hard to imagine less convincing line readings. Even Patel of ""Slumdog Millionaire"" fame is one-dimensional. Zuko is hoping to capture Aang so that his people known as the Fire Nation can suppress the Earth Air and Water tribes. Hes been banished by his father the Fire Lord Ozai (Cliff Curtis) until he returns with the prize. In other words Zuko is seeking redemption and reconciliation with an emotionally withholding father. But judging by the look of his constant scowl all he really needs is some ibuprofen. The grown-ups dont fare much better. As Commander Zhao Aasif Mandvi delivers a histrionic eye-rolling performance. Only Shaun Toub as Zukos wise Uncle Iroh manages anything close to subtlety. As for the special effects the bending of the elements is Ill admit kind of sort of cool. Walls of dirt rise up to repel fireballs. Oceans surge and turn to ice. And Aang rides around on a hang glider that unfolds from a staff he carries. After a while though all the fighting between people hurling rocks flames water balloons and blasts of air at each other starts to resemble as a waggish friend noted one long game of rock paper scissors. It gets real old real fast. Too bad you cant say the same for the immature and unseasoned cast. Contains martial arts and mildly violent action.

"The Last Airbender Ill wind bad water muddy plotting little fire | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Last Airbender Ill wind bad water muddy plotting little fireEven 3-D technology cant inject a much-needed extra dimension to The Last Airbender.Noah Ringer plays Aang in a scene from ""The Last Airbender"".  (SUPPLIED IMAGE)  By Bruce DeMaraEntertainment ReporterWed. June 30 2010The Last Airbender(out of 4)Starring Noah Ringer Nicola Peltz Dev Patel. Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan.Too much wind not enough fire.The latest animated franchise to get bumped up to Hollywood blockbuster is like the popular kid on the playground all flash and little substance. Sure easy on the eyes and tricked out with the latest CGI gadgetry but even 3-D technology cant inject a much-needed extra dimension to The Last Airbender.Article Continued BelowUnfortunately like most things emanating from La-La Land (which arguably exists in a dimension all its own) the title is misleading. There are surely two more ""last"" Airbender movies to come to complete the trilogy under the able but no longer inspired hand of M. Night Shyamalan.Taking on the first project that doesnt originally derive from his own fevered imagination -- though he wrote the script -- Shyamalan is doubtlessly hoping to first avoid the critical drubbing his past few films have deservedly received (unlikely) and second to amass the seed money for the film that will redeem his reputation as a smart filmmaker capable of getting audiences to sit up in their seats and go ""Wow I didnt see that coming."" (Also unlikely.)This first instalment opens with a boyish avatar emerging from a century in the deep freeze hopefully in time to halt the further encroachment of the Fire Lord and his fire minions onto the lives of the Earth Water and Air people.""I ran away but Im back now"" says our suitably solemn-eyed protagonist Aang (pronounced like ""ung"" the sound one makes upon receiving a sharp jab to the ribs after nodding off in a darkened theatre). Noah Ringer has just enough screen presence to carry off the role though his performance falls well short of charismatic and riveting.Likewise the rest of the cast is merely adequate and not particularly memorable with the exception of Dev Patel who has a few nice moments as Prince Zuko the tormented son of the Fire Lord.The dialogue is prosaic and the scene changes quick and jarring taking us from back and forth to places like the Southern Earth Kingdom or the Northern Air Kingdom or . . . after a while it all begins to feel a bit like too much fantasy geography and not enough solid story-telling. The costumes and sets are nicely conceived though the mythological creatures feel recycled. For example the horned fur ball that flies our hero and his friends around is surely the offspring of the flying dust mop from the long-ago NeverEnding Story.For a generation of young minds raised on explicit video game gore and mayhem the fight sequences are going to seem awfully tame. The dearth of suspense throughout is palpable and the climax so reassuringly safe its unlikely to trigger nightmares in young impressionable minds.Its easy to become cynical when the studio behind the film which took 150 million to make is spending another 130 million to promote it hoping to cash in during a summer when the competition appears weak.Airbender despite pleasing visuals is epic fantasy at its most uninspired and unrewarding.

Night Shyamalans chintzy fable cant be saved by stars The elements crush The Last Airbender Joe Neumaier Thursday July 1 2010 400 AM facebook Tweet email Sparkly performances cant save M. Night Shyamalans The Last Airbender from being a chintzy over-blown fable. (Industrial Light and Magic) Joe Neumaier Thursday July 1 2010 400 AM Title The Last Airbender Its almost sad what a mess ""The Last Airbender"" is. Based on a popular Nickelodeon anime adventure series this not-brainless family action-adventure contains enthusiastic performances from fresh young actors and an almost Zen calm as it goes through some familiar blockbuster paces.Unfortunately its positive attributes are thrown out of balance by its abundant negatives - including chintzy effects lumbering storytelling and an overstylized earnest incompetence that evokes ""Speed Racer."" If you thought it was bad when writer-director M. Night Shyamalan was channeling Rod Serling wait till you see him try to be George Lucas.In an unspecified ancient era four nations rule the world each dedicated to different elements. The Fire Nation is an aggressor terrorizing the Air Water and Earth Nations. In these lands are gifted ""benders"" who can control their native element and use it as a weapon. Katara (Nicola Peltz) is a budding water-bender and as she and her brother Sokka (""Twilight"" alum Jackson Rathbone) are frolicking near the South Pole a 10-year-old bald boy named Aang (Noah Ringer) emerges from the ice.It turns out Aang is the Buddha-like Avatar a being born as an airbender but reincarnated for ages and possessing the ability to control all four elements. His destiny is to stop the Fire nation and its nasty leaders Prince Zuko (""Slumdog Millionaires"" Dev Patel) and Commander Zhao (miscast ""Daily Show"" funnyman Aasif Mandvi).The shows fans will get more from this struggle than newcomers yet even they have to admit that what works in Japanese-style animation doesnt translate here. Aang confers with a mystical serpent and is wounded when half a yin-yang fish god is killed - the movies spiritual core feels like ""Willow"" mixed with ""Kung Fu."" And it doesnt help that when benders jump into action their silly poses (as in the animated version) look like a mix of tai chi Pilobolus Dance Theatre and a case of spastic colon.Its now accepted that the promise Shyamalan showed with 1999s ""The Sixth Sense"" has been whittled away by consecutively awful movies. Although ""Unbreakable"" his sophomore effort is underappreciated ""The Village"" ""Lady in the Water"" and ""The Happening"" deserve their bad raps. Still Shyamalan enjoys a (self-made) image as a storyteller supreme a teller of moral fables. Hes really just a tedious striver whose terrible way with actors does them a disservice by for example encouraging a wide-eyed amazed look thus foretelling that no one in the audience will ever share that feeling during his movies.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""The Last Airbender"" covers a lot of ground in just under two hours and viewers who are unfamiliar with the popular Nickelodeon animated series that inspired the film may find themselves wishing the movie had opened with five minutes of maps timelines and explanatory notes. Long story short were visiting a mystical world where geopolitics is a four-way rivalry among nations affiliated with Air Water Earth and Fire (insert 1980s funk-band joke here). Psychically gifted citizens of each place can defend themselves by chucking quantities of their native element at adversaries. The fire nation is the most warlike and its Napoleonic leader is determined to subjugate the others with ash-belching battleships and ninja-clad warriors who are literal flame throwers. Against them stand Katara and her brother Sokka teen warriors from the Water tribe and Aang a 12-year-old thawed out after a century encased in ice. He is an Avatar capable of commanding all four elements and blowing evildoers to sparkling satisfying smithereens. Groggy yet? Hold on you havent met headstrong Prince Zuko and his courtly guardian Uncle Iroh fierce Fire Nation Admiral Zhao Fire Lord Ozai or Princess Yue whose prematurely white hair somehow powers the moon. The plot here is like Hansel and Gretels bread-crumb trail after a hurricane. This is pure introductory adventure meant to immerse us in the series richly complicated universe. In truth there is more metaphysics and exposition in the movie than I could digest. At a certain point my brain ceased processing new input and simply switched to sensory input mode. From there on I had a fine time. The story is at best incidental to the pleasures this film has to offer. Despite significant stretches of talky tedium there is plenty here on which to hang a franchise. ""The Last Airbender"" is one of the most visually luscious and exhilarating entertainments I have seen this year full of giddy fireworks and kinetic pleasure. I suspect writer/director M. Night Shayamalan has been watching the early ""Star Wars"" films and such intricately art-directed Chinese super-productions as ""House of Flying Daggers."" The film is chockablock with gee-wow marvels. The Asian-inspired sets are extraordinary. Aang and friends travel on a flying six-legged albino beaver; Fire Nation cavalrymen ride into battle on giant geckos. The camera observes these psychedelic wonders casually as George Lucas nonchalantly showed us the twin moons of Tatooine. And in the Lucas manner the warfare is bloodless with fighters felled by special-effects showers of ice or wind or sparks so that combat has a sort of gorgeous grandeur. There are echoes of earnest young Luke Skywalker and Harry Potter too in Aang. He is a Young Man of Whom Great Things Are Expected who must train his telekinetic skills and accept his fate as his worlds savior among an order of mystic monks though hed rather snuggle into a normal family. His waterbending companion Katara is courageous and determined to help Aang fulfill his destiny (hello Hermione). Her overprotective brother Sokka (hi there Ron) is on hand to add a little adolescent heat in his flirtation with doe-eyed Princess Yue. Zade Rosenthal Paramount Pictures Noah Ringer complete with extensive tattoos plays the heroic Aang in ""The Last Airbender."" Any decently powered laptop could cough up these characters given the right input of Joseph Campbell and Japanese comic books. But to his credit Shyamalan focuses on their humanity wedding emotions and effects. The ingratiating young cast does well in roles that are about 40 percent tai chi moves and determined scowls. Noah Ringer never camps it up as the bald extensively tattooed Aang and his martial-arts moves could sweep new Karate Kid Jaden Smith right onto his keister. Nicola Peltz as Katara is required to regurgitate reams of fantasyland history and somehow remains engaged and engaging. Jackson Rathbone (currently playing a much more mature vampire character in ""Eclipse"") makes Sokka sturdy and likable despite an unbecoming shaved-temples and ponytail hairdont. The most-ambitious performance award goes to Dev Patel as the Fire Nations Hamlet-like Prince Zuko inconsolably bitter because of his fathers indifference. With his thousand-yard stare and eruptive rages he brings scorching intensity to his performance as an angry young royal. Because of its continent-hopping escapades and ever-escalating battles the film feels rushed with characters and situations whipping by so quickly that most feel underdeveloped. When we reach the climax a smooth handoff to the next link in the series we feel a key element is missing. For all its spine-tingling satisfactions ""The Last Airbender"" hasnt staked a unique claim on our imaginations as it recycles set pieces from earlier blockbusters it tries so hard to emulate. Maybe that cohesive vision that elevating passion that soul arrives in the next installment.

"The Last Airbender movie review Beautiful but boring |       NJ.com comments The Last Airbender movie review Beautiful but boring Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on July 01 2010 at 800 AM View/Post Comments PARAMOUNT PICTURES PHOTOSNicola Peltz plays Katara in ""The Last Airbender"" a live-action film based on the popular cartoon. On television ""Avatar The Last Airbender"" was a childrens animated series that mixed bits of Eastern religions martial arts Inuit culture and anime style. On the big screen ""The Last Airbender"" (a certain James Cameron movie forced the title tweak) is a live-action film that subtracts much of the multi-culturalism and adds useless 3-D and tons of CGI. Guess which one is worth your while? The movie arrives chased by controversy -- protests by fans that the story has been figuratively whitewashed. Although several characters like Katara and Sokka were dark-skinned in the cartoon here theyre played by Caucasians. Director M. Night Shyamalan trying to get ahead of the criticism has said that anime often blurs race (which is true). Hes also said that he didnt know the backgrounds of some of the actors when he cast them (which sounds dubious). But the fact remains that race is a factor here. Caucasian actors in the movie tend to get lines; non-Caucasian actors tend to be used as background. The movies Fire Nation tribe has Indian and Maori stars -- but theyre the swarthy villains. For a director who is himself Indian-American its a pretty thoughtless approach at best. Movie Review The Last Airbender (PG) Paramount (103 min.) Directed by M. Night Shyamalan. With Noah Ringer Nicola Peltz Jackson Rathbone. Now playing in New Jersey. Ratings note The film contains martial-arts violence. Stephen Whittys review TWO STARS But thats not the biggest problem with ""The Last Airbender""; even in the show our hero Aang for all his Tibetan trappings often seemed blandly American. And movies can be excruciatingly p.c. and still be dreadful. What really hurts this pretty film is how pretty dull it is. The TV show created an incredibly complex world over three seasons. This picture (the first in a proposed trilogy) tries to accomplish a years worth of work in two hours. So we get titles and flashbacks baldly expository dialogue and clumsy narration. It doesnt help. Nor does the cast. First-timer Noah Ringer moves well enough as the kick-boxing messiah Aang but hes no actor and Nicola Peltz and Jackson Rathbone are terminally bland as Katara and Sokka respectively. (Meanwhile as the villain Aasif Mandvi chews the scenery as if he were at an all-you-can-eat buffet.) PARAMOUNTNoah Ringer stars in the big screen version of ""The Last Airbender."" For all his over-hyped screenplay trickery Shyamalan has always been an old-fashioned filmmaker; unlike ""Prince of Persia"" say ""The Last Airbender"" eschews quick cutting and multiple close-ups to let its action unfold in long beautifully photographed master-shots. While its an interesting change its a misjudged one. Because the actors are so forgettable we dont care about the characters; the stateliness of the photography only distances us further. For the uninitiated the plot concerns a prophesied hero awoken from a 100-year sleep; he has the power to control (or ""bend"") air and once he can master the other cosmic elements he can save the world. Or at least save it from the evil Fire Nation. Naturally the flamers dont intend to let Aang finish his studies. They shouldnt worry so much. Although theres supposedly more to come this expensive epic has the huge hugely desperate feel of ""The Golden Compass"" ""Eragon"" and all those other films that were supposed to kick off kids-movie franchises -- and never got past their first installments. ""The Last Airbender""? It just might be.

No more like a boring and incoherent 280 million mashup of sci-fi and fantasy cliches Andrew OHehir Follow Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies The Last Airbender Entertainment News Dev Patel in ""The Last Airbender"" Ever since his explosive emergence with ""The Sixth Sense"" in 1999 writer-director M. Night Shyamalan has built a highly successful career out of sentimental supernatural movies with increasingly idiotic third-act ""reveals"" as they say in the screenwriting trade. Theyre all dead and living in heaven or possibly Pennsylvania Aliens hate hot dogs apple pie and baseball The whole story is happening at a Renaissance Faire It was all a dream Bruce Willis is ... an overpaid Republican with a goony smileAt least thats how I remember them. With this formula having reached the point of diminishing returns several movies ago -- certainly by the ludicrous ""Lady in the Water"" if not all the way back to ""Unbreakable"" -- Shyamalan has now sought therapy for his addiction in the form of making the most thoroughly predictable story you can imagine. Adapted from a popular childrens animated series ""The Last Airbender"" is a generic mishmash of themes images and ideas drawn from a long list of quest narratives and science-fiction classics. Its a little bit Tolkien a little bit Lucas a little bit ""Matrix"" a little bit ""Dune"" and rather too much Philip Pullman all stuck together with some powerfully expensive effects and lots of cute kids doing tai chi.I can see why Shyamalan was attracted to this material but the results are clunky even by his recent standards. What weve got here is a completely acceptable rainy-Saturday time-waster for kids -- to whom the jumbled collection of cliches and archetypes presumably wont seem so third-hand -- pumped up to the level of unsustainable grandiosity thanks to Hollywoods economy of stupefaction. With a reported production budget of 280 million and the inevitable post-production ""up-conversion"" to murky light-robbing 3-D ""The Last Airbender"" is meant to be a franchise-launching worldwide phenomenon. Maybe itll get there; I claim no expertise in gauging public taste. But Shyamalan spends so much of the movie trying to dazzle us with bigness and self-importance that he forgets to tell a good story. Or much of any story really.This is one of those movies where the plot cant just happen; it has to arrive at your door like a series of singing telegrams. Weve got an opening text-crawl right out of one of the bewildering second-string ""Star Wars"" films written in pseudo-ancient prose full of phrases like ""amongst all the peoples of the world."" Theres voice-over narration every so often from a young semi-magical ""Waterbender"" named Katara (Nicola Peltz) along with on-screen titles letting us know were now in the ""Northern Air Temple"" or ""Fire Nation Colony 15 or wherever. Even with that every scene in the movie involves more yakkety-yak explication -- what happened to some people we dont know about a long time ago to set up whats happening now -- just so we can limp along to the next CGI action sequence.See there once was peace love and understanding amongst all them peoples who are divided into four semi-rivalrous element-based clans the Air Nation Water Nation Fire Nation and Earth Nation. There is one transcendent leader called the Avatar -- he gets endlessly reincarnated after the fashion of a Tibetan lama -- who keeps these nations at peace but he disappeared a century ago and the steampunkish Fire Nation rocking a Nazi-Mordor Industrial Revolution ethos is bent on conquering the world. Katara and her brother Sokka (Jackson Rathbone) members of an isolated Water Nation outpost find a little boy frozen in the ice. Hes the missing Avatar naturally -- last survivor of the all-but-exterminated Air Nation -- and they set out to save the world. If that sounds like a pile of spoilers uh no. Thats what I learned in the first 10 minutes of the film before I began exercising my own magic powers and writing shopping lists with my mind. Did my wife say laundry detergent or dishwasher detergent? You Might Also Like As Aang (played by 12-year-old Noah Ringer) the Avatar discovered in the permafrost alongside his faithful fuzzy flying companion -- its like a giant Ewok cross-bred with Mothra -- begins to assume his full powers the effects budget takes over the movie which definitely raises both the ""wow"" factor and the pure silliness. Aang can go into spooky trances with what looks like a light-up One Way arrow on his head where he seeks advice from a dragon-spirit in a misty cave. As a born Airbender he can summon impressive windstorms and the insufferably New Age priestly caste of the Water Nation will soon teach him their Zen-psychotherapy approach to controlling the wet stuff as well.Despite the Internet uproar launched by some fans of the animated series ""Avatar The Last Airbender"" (which was going to be the title of this movie until uh other forces intervened) I have to say that the racial controversy around this movie is overblown. Its true that Shyamalan has cast white actors as the principal protagonists (although Aangs race and color are ambiguous) and no doubt marketing concerns played a role. Its also true that he depicts the charismatic villains of the Fire Nation as South Asian in appearance (and Shyamalan himself was born in India). Indeed the only truly interesting or complicated character in this whole movie is the Fire Nations exiled Prince Zuko played by Indo-British actor Dev Patel (star of ""Slumdog Millionaire""). Katara and Sokkas Water Nation is depicted as a mix of white and Central Asian or Inuit people while the Earth Nations people although barely seen here are East Asian in appearance. With Katara Sokka and Aang holed up in the Water Nations icebound northern stronghold the Fire Nations nefarious Commander Zhao (Aasif Mandvi) arriving with a vast smoke-belching navy and tormented Prince Zuko skulking around the margins like the freelance Gollum-type he is ""The Last Airbender"" cranks itself up to a lumbering impressive -- and no doubt monumentally expensive -- final battle scene. But I never get the feeling that Shyamalan is much interested in this clumsily rendered narrative or its characters. ""The Last Airbender"" feels like hackwork -- gorgeous and elaborate hackwork at times -- and as crazy as some of Shyamalans movies have been (well OK all of them) hes never been guilty of that.It may not be accidental that Zuko the boyish Indian prince cut off from his own people and bitterly alone is the only character in ""The Last Airbender"" who seems to possess an individual personality. Hes trying to navigate complicated ties of blood honor mystery and magic while everybody else stands around explaining the past declaiming platitudes and occasionally kicking some ass. For kids and tweens who loved the Nickelodeon series the latter qualities may be enough. But even though great acts of magic are performed and great sacrifices made etc. its all instantly forgettable. Except for Zuko sitting alone in a cafe mourning what he has lost and can never get back looking as if he can see dead people. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

"Last Airbender The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; last-airbender-the ) Last Airbender The (United States 2010) June 30 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Seen in standard (non-IMAX) 3D. Every since word got out regarding some race-change shenanigans in the motion picture version of The Last Airbender controversy has hovered over this production. Having seen the movie I can assure anyone concerned about racism (latent or otherwise) that this is a far less pressing issue than how a movie crafted with such obvious and far-reaching incompetence could be allowed to open with the label of a ""major summer release."" With a script written on a level that only a seven-year old could appreciate The Last Airbender is an insult to anyone with a triple-digit I.Q. and a willingness to use it inside the confines of a movie theater. This is bad filmmaking and bad storytelling. It also sounds what should be the death knell to M. Night Shyamalans career. With The Last Airbender following up The Happening and Lady in the Water its astonishing to think that any studio would entrust this man with another project. The story which Shyamalan based on an animated Nickelodeon TV show tells of a world where four tribes exist each representing an element (air water earth fire). Within the tribes are ""benders"" - wizard-like individuals who can manipulate the tribes element. And somewhere in the world is the ""Avatar"" a person who can control all four - but he has been missing for 100 years. As The Last Airbender begins he is missing no longer. Katara (Nicola Peltz) and Sokka (Jackson Rathbone) members of the Water tribe discover the boy Aang (Noah Ringer) buried under the ice while on an expedition. Not knowing that he is the Avatar they bring him home but before they can arrange to return him to his people they are attacked by warriors of the Fire tribe led by the rebel Prince Zuko (Dev Patel). Zuko divines Aangs identity and takes him prisoner but a boy of Aangs powers is unlikely to remain captive for long. Soon he is free and the chase is on with Zuko trying to recapture Aang before Fire Commander Zhao (Aasif Mandvi) claims the prize for his Fire Lord (Cliff Curtis). Meanwhile Aang aided by Katara and Sokka heads to the lands of the Earth tribe and the Northern Water tribe in an attempt to awaken some of his latent powers. The Last Airbender feels like throwback to the pre-Lord of the Rings/Harry Potter era when fantasy was a joke (the bastard son of science fiction) and when movies like Willow dotted the landscape and set unwatchably low expectations for the genre. The film is a compilation of bad fantasy clichA(c)s that are inelegantly stitched together. To keep the length to about 90 minutes sequences deserving of exploration (such as a major battle) are rushed and the movie ends half-finished leaving the door open for further chapters. (Pleasea|no) This is probably the worst high-profile fantasy movie since Eragon. Its hard to express how off-putting Shyamalans script is. The movie is filled with awkward exposition - scenes in which characters state things for no reason other than to inform the audience of some piece of background. A romance develops out of nowhere for characters we dont care about. A lot of things such as Aangs ability to drop into a trance and speak with a dragon spirit are poorly motivated and reek of deus ex machina. The narrative is not inherently juvenile but the way in which Shyamalan has developed it is. This is not a ""family film"" - a production aimed at kids but with elements designed to entertain adults. This is for children only - those undiscriminating enough not to notice or care about how poorly assembled the movie is. Visually The Last Airbender is a disaster and a good portion of the problem is (yet again) the 3D. The post-production conversion is at least as bad as what was done to Clash of the Titans if not worse. The entire film has a fuzzy out-of-focus appearance. (I rubbed my eyes once and checked the lens of my glasses for spots.) Its murky and washed out - even the snow scenes where there should have been an abundance of light are dull. I cant speak for how The Last Airbender might look in 2D where the images should be crisp and bright but the 3D presentation falls below the bar for what is acceptable. Theaters should pay viewers a surcharge to agree to see this sort of subpar material. The only word I can use to describe the acting is embarrassing. Did Shyamalan do his casting at junior high theatrical productions? With all the child actors available to him couldnt he have chosen performers who could display emotions with conviction and recite their lines without sounding like they were reading from a teleprompter? Even the adults arent impressive with the exception being Dev Patel (the hero of Slumdog Millionaire) who apparently didnt get the memo that he was supposed to be hammy and over-the-top. Some pundits had voiced the opinion that the route back to relevance for Shyamalan might come through adapting someone elses material. The Last Airbender argues strongly against that line of thought; this trumps anything he has previously achieved in terms of mind boggling awfulness. There are times when one wonders whether he is channeling Ed Wood. Fundamental flaws infect nearly every aspect of the production; its an insult to viewers especially those who are fans of the television source material to charge money for something so substandard that if it was a building it would be condemned. In some ways the 3D problems are a red herring. With apologies to William Shakespeare shit by another other name would smell as rank. Last Airbender The (United States 2010) Director M.

"Movie review The Last Airbender - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-FilmMovie review The Last AirbenderThe dialogue is unsophisticated and the interchanges are uninspired. But if youre in the target 10-and-younger audience you might like M. Night Shyamalans film.July 01 2010|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic If ever a film was born under a bad sign ""The Last Airbender"" is it. As the blues lyric goes if it didnt have bad luck it wouldnt have any kind of luck at all. Not only does this live-action feature written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan have to weather comparisons with the hugely popular (and DVD-available) animated TV series that inspired it it lost the first word of its title a ""Avatar"" a when a certain other film used it first. Then ""The Last Airbender"" irritated fans by changing its trio of heroes from Asian to white and weathered the inevitable suspicion that goes with both a late conversion to 3-D and a studio decision to keep the film away from journalists and critics until close to the last minute. It would be nice to say that this story has a miraculous Hollywood ending and that ""The Last Airbender"" beat those long odds but that is not to be. By specifically critical and broadly adult standards this film is undoubtedly a disappointment but it is disappointing in a way that its intended audience may not notice. For more than most films ""Airbender"" is made for a 10-and-younger audience and a 10-and-younger audience alone. Unlike the recent ""Percy Jackson"" saga and most nominal films for children which shoehorn in teenage material and secretly want to be hooking adults as well ""Airbender"" whether intentionally or not is pegged almost exclusively to a small-fry state of mind. Echoing the Nickelodeon TV series created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko ""The Last Airbender"" takes us to a self-contained mythic universe inhabited by four tribal peoples the air nomads the water tribe the earth kingdom and the fire nation. Each group has chosen people in it called ""benders"" who can yes bend their particular element to their will. In the best of times these nations live in harmony under the guidance of an avatar a rare individual who can bend all four elements and keeps balance in the world by consulting with animal spirits ordinary folks cant communicate with. The last 100 years however have not been the best of times. The avatar has disappeared and in his absence the bellicose fire nation ruled by the unpleasant Fire Lord Ozai ( New Zealands Cliff Curtis) has taken it upon itself to attempt to rule the world. ""Airbender"" begins with Sokka ("" Twilights"" Jackson Rathbone) and Katara ( Nicola Peltz) a young brother and sister of the Eskimo-like northern water tribe. He is an everykid; she is a waterbender still learning to control her powers. Out amid the ice floes of their world Sokka and Katara come across Aang ( Noah Ringer) a young boy who looks like a baby Dalai Lama imprisoned in an iceberg. Not only does Aang have tattoos on his bald head outing him as the worlds last airbender he is revealed to be the missing avatar that peace-loving people have been yearning for. Naturally the fire nation doesnt take this news sitting down and soon enough two separate forces try to capture Aang. The super-evil Commander Zhao ( Aasif Mandvi) is the stop-at-nothing type while young Prince Zuko ("" Slumdog Millionaires"" Dev Patel) the Fire Lords exiled son wants to do the deed to get back into his fathers good graces. ""The Last Airbenders"" Kids-R-Us intentions are most visible in the films determinedly unsophisticated dialogue uninspired interchanges that not only echo the language of the cartoon series but also put one in mind of the back-and-forth of such 1950s kids shows as the ""The Adventures of Spin and Marty"" episodes of Walt Disneys ""The Mickey Mouse Club."" Similarly though they keep the plot moving along nothing about the films functional visual effects makes a major impression not the 3-D transfer which adds very little to the proceedings or even the fierce battleships of the fire nation reminiscent though they are of the steamships that turn up in Hayao Miyazakis epics. Despite Aang Katara and Sokka being played by white actors ""The Last Airbender"" retains the Asian feeling of the original shows including liberal doses of martial arts tai chi Buddhist philosophy and Tibetan religion. In fact if there is anything that is intended to resonate with adults at least parents of the New Age persuasion it is the philosophical truisms that dot the dialogue lines like ""water teaches us acceptance"" ""you must let anger go"" ""there is no love without sacrifice"" and the ever-popular ""is there a spiritual place where I can meditate?"" Speaking of truisms it is one of Hollywoods articles of faith that films that dont intentionally hook parents never get a chance to please kids. With a sequel to this picture and a possible trilogy already in the planning stages it will be interesting to see if ""The Last Airbender"" proves that rule or breaks it. kenneth.turanlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESWhat it took to film The Last Airbender in icy GreenlandJuly 7 2010The Last Airbender fire effect a tricky elementJuly 1 2010Last Airbender carries Shyamalan into new territoryJune 25 2010On the set Casting of aLast Airbendera stirs...May 2 2010Casting the case for raceApril 7 2010MORE STORIES ABOUTFilmAvatarAirbenderCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-air-bender-20100701,0,5794859.story",200,thelastairbender21,thelastairbender,latimes

(Ellen Dunkel)By Carrie Rickey INQUIRER MOVIE CRITICPosted June 30 2010Blessed with enchanting visuals and blighted with clunky dialogue The Last Airbender is stunning in at least two senses of the word.M. Night Shyamalans mash-up of Star Wars and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon unfolds in a mythical world out of balance.In this epic allegory adapted from Nickelodeons animated series for 100 years the Earth Air and Water nations have been decimated by armies of the Fire nation. (Think a cosmic version of rock/paper/scissors.)Only the Avatar the chosen one who can ""bend"" or control all four elements can restore harmony. And chances are slim for the Fire nation in its drive for power has eliminated all airbenders.Thus Sokka (Jackson Rathbone) and his sister Katara (Nicola Peltz) members of the Water Tribe are startled by Aang (Noah Ringer) a 12-year-old airbender who emerges from an icy embryo in the sea near their village. Aang has serious skills; might he be the One?Certainly Prince Zuko (Dev Patel) son of Fire Lord Ozai thinks so as he tries to catch and vanquish the elusive martial artist who conjures whirlwinds to defeat his opponents. Unbound by gravity Aang darts past and levitates above those who would capture him.The fantasy is made complete by Appa a six-legged bison resembling a tamed version of one of Maurice Sendaks Wild Things. Appa transports Aang to places where he can learn how to bend water earth and fire and thus achieve universal equilibrium.Unfortunately this all proceeds at a supersonic tempo with Shyamalans directorial finger stuck on the fast-forward button. Significant plot points whiz by in this movie equivalent of speed-dating.The production design (by Philip Messina) is jaw-dropping and encyclopedic in its cultural references. The kingdom of the Northern Water Tribe resembles a dream Angkor Wat; the hall of avatars is a fantasia on the terra cotta warriors of Xian; the palace of the Fire Lord is Alhambra meets Taj Mahal.The evocative costumes (by Judianna Makovsky) are likewise eye-popping ranging from coarse nomadic cassocks to silky robes with delicate embroidery.Similarly the special effects (courtesy of Industrial Light and Magic) are unusually effective especially when Katara conjures water balls and plays soccer with them.All might have been even more effective were Messinas imaginative worlds and Makovskys vivid costumes not drained of life by a 3-D retrofit that debases their obvious artistry into diorama cheesiness. (In other words see this in 2-D.)In sum Loved the look of the film hated the 3-D thought some of the performances clunky and felt that way about the dialogue too.Shyamalan compresses a ton of plot exposition in every line and the resulting heavyosity is too much for the younger actors to carry. At many points I was reminded of Harrison Fords crack to George Lucas on the set of Star Wars ""You can type this [stuff] George but you sure cant say it.""Though Rathbone falls short of bringing Ford-style levity to his Han Solo role Ringer is nimble as Aang and Patel Shakespearean as Prince Zuko emotionally torn between trying to please his tyrannical father (Cliff Curtis) and following his own heart.Theres been a lot of bloviating in the blogosphere about how Shyamalan whitewashed Airbender by casting Caucasians Rathbone Peltz and Ringer.Whitewashed? Apart from the films look the films biggest strength is in the performances by Patel (Anglo-Indian) Curtis (Maori) and Aasif Mandvi (Anglo-Indian).

Night Shyamalan takes the beloved Nickelodeon anime series -- the full title was Avatar The Last Airbender -- and turns it into 103 minutes of overproduced stilted nonsense. Dev Patel plays Prince Zuko in Paramount Pictures adventure ""The Last Airbender."" Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald6/30/2010 Editor rating 1 In The Last Airbender writer-director M. Night Shyamalan takes the beloved Nickelodeon anime series -- the full title was Avatar The Last Airbender -- and turns it into 103 minutes of overproduced stilted nonsense. Fans of the TV show who are already well-versed in the complex mythology of this story about a war between the realms of the four elements could conceivably enjoy seeing the series re-enacted in live-action. Early in the movie comes a brief battle between fire and earth benders -- people with the gift to control their respective elements -- that suggests all that exposition youve endured thus far may eventually build into something pretty cool. But the set-up never stops -- characters are constantly explaining themselves and what they need to accomplish instead of actually speaking to each other -- and the plot doesnt so much build as prattle. The chief reason The Last Airbender doesnt work is that this is the first chapter in a three-volume tale (the movie is subtitled Book I Water) and once you realize the film is only going to take you to a preordained point in the story and end with a cliffhanger the picture becomes an endurance test. Peter Jackson filmed all three Lord of the Rings movies back-to-back so while watching The Fellowship of the Ring you knew you werent going to get a complete ending but youd eventually see the entire epic. Shyamalan has only directed one Airbender movie -- hes signed on for two sequels but their fate rests with the box office grosses of this 150 million production -- and this situation feels awfully reminiscent of The Golden Compass the first (and open-ended) installment in an intended franchise that was abandoned after audiences didnt turn out in enough numbers. In compressing what took 10 hours to unfold on TV into one choppy CGI-laden film The Last Airbender retains its basic narrative but loses its soul. The eponymous hero Aang a boy with great powers who must learn to bend water fire and earth before bringing peace to the four realms is played by Noah Ringer a young actor who fares well with the elaborate action and interpretative-dance movements benders make while doing their magic. But Ringer has zero personality or charm -- hes a pleasant but generic screen presence -- and the characters surrounding him such as his guardians Katara (Nicola Peltz) and Sokka (Twilights Jackson Rathbone) fare even worse. Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense The Village The Happening) has never directed this sort of gargantuan epic before and he seems overwhelmed by the technical demands of the job leaving the actors to fend for themselves which they mostly do poorly. The only character who makes any sort of impression is the Fire Prince Zuko (Slumdog Millionaires Dev Patel) who wants to kidnap Aang in order to win back his fathers love and respect. Hes a familiar but engaging archetype -- the disgraced son on a quest to regain his family honor -- and The Last Airbenders best scenes all involve him. The rest of the movie is comprised of a giant flying buffalo a wise dragon that talks in an old mans voice and battle scenes that once again resort to the bullet-time photography The Matrix invented. The Last Airbender may please children who always enjoy watching heroic kids kicking grown-up butts. But despite the originality and depth of the scenario this feels like awfully silly overblown nonsense (``Water teaches us acceptance. Let your emotions flow like water) saddled by a fuzzy 3D conversion that distracts more than it adds. The best movie fantasies are light and fast and transporting If The Last Airbender were an element it would be slushy heavy mud.

Night Shyamalan; Author M. Night Shyamalan; Release Date Wide 07/02/2010 Posted June 30 2010 -- 1200 AM EDT The title character of M. Night Shyamalans junior mystical martial-arts fantasy The Last Airbender is a young boy named Aang (Noah Ringer) with big bright eyes a monks shaved head and an intricate array of symmetrical tattoos that culminate in an arrow pointing right down his forehead (its sort of the equivalent of a third eye). He also has the ability to bend air -- that is to whoosh and shove chunks of the atmosphere around him so that the air literally gets turned into a weapon. Aang were told is the one person on earth who still possesses this ancient talent (though a number of others know how to bend water fire and clods of dirt). In a world engulfed by tribal warfare he is also ""the Avatar"" the only one who can save mankind. Hes a leaping flying butt-kicking prepubescent Christ figure in Zen robes. To accomplish his air-bending Aang assumes a series of highly balletic tai chi poses twirling and bowing his body curling his hands around like a boy dancer. The movie should have been called Crouching Billy Elliott Hidden Air Pocket. The Last Airbender is Shyamalans adaptation of the animated Nickelodeon series that debuted in 2005 and the filmmaker -- working for the first time from someone elses material -- has said that he was drawn to the series because of his daughters and that in essence he watched it through their eyes. I have no doubt that theyll like the movie. The Last Airbender is compulsively faithful to the series -- to its lexicon and mythology its boy-wizard spirit and to everything it meticulously borrows from movies and books and graphic novels and anime and videogames. Shyamalan for all his talent has always been a deeply derivative filmmaker. Signs was warmed-over Spielberg The Village was The Crucible gone Twilight Zone and even The Sixth Sense (still his most celebrated movie) was in essence Ghost meets The Shining. So it makes sense that hed be drawn to The Last Airbender which on TV is a veritable trash compactor of familiar tropes and effects. The movie is Star Wars with martial arts plus a touch of The Last Emperor. Technically its not badly done; I enjoyed the physical clash of elements the water balls rising like sculpture in the air. The trouble with The Last Airbender is that Aang as a character is a saintly abstraction (Noah Ringer plays him with a sensitive pout that grows cloying) and hes surrounded by generic young actors who are like place holders for real stars. Your eyes are sometimes dazzled but youre shut out of the spectacle because theres no one of any force or charm or stature to identify with. Aang whos like a generic kiddie-Buddhist Luke Skywalker teams up with the young waterbender Katara (Nicola Peltz) and her brother Sokka (Jackson Rathbone) to go up against the aggressors of Fire Nation -- who are basically a fascist-empire group a tribe of Death Star marauders. Their most vengeful member is Prince Zuko a sullen young man with a singed scar on the side of his face who is working out his daddy issues. Hes an Anakin Skywalker clone played by Dev Patel from Slumdog Millionaire whose performance here is an unvarying snit fit. The story considering how busy it is isnt much. Sokka develops a crush on Princess Yue (Seychelle Gabriel) whose complicated white hair and cheerleader voice render her a kind of Cosmic Barbie; Aang to get in full fighting mode must learn how to bend the three other elements beginning with water (fire and earth presumably will be left to the sequels). As for the 3-D Im tempted to leave responsible critical language behind and say quite simply that it sucks -- except that the 3-D visuals in this movie would have to exist before they could be called terrible. The Last Airbender keeps throwing things at you but its final effect is in every way flat.

Night ShyamalanDistributor Paramount PicturesRating PG for fantasy action violenceRunning time 1 hour 36 minutesOpens Thursday nationwide By Scott Bowles USA TODAY He hasnt mastered the craft yet but M. Night Shyamalan may be on to something with this action-movie thing. His first film in this genre The Last Airbender shows glimpses of the brash director behind chillers like The Sixth Sense and Signs movies that prompted Newsweek to declare him ""the next Spielberg."" Since then though his forays into suspense have seen diminishing critical and financial returns. Lady in the Water tanked at the box office and The Happening was an odd film even for the eclectic Shyamalan about a virus embodied by the wind that prompted folks to want to end it all. Some critics even said the film also gave them the affliction. THE LAST AIRBENDER Watch the trailer But here its clear Shyamalan is working from a passion that frequently fuels his movies parenting. The director 39 used to watch the Nickelodeon animated show Avatar The Last Airbender with his 7-year-old son and he persuaded Paramount to make a big-screen rendition about the adventures of a child Aang (played by newcomer Noah Ringer) who can control the natural elements. Shyamalan gives the film a darker tone though not one that should put off fans of the cartoon which in its heyday drew more than 5 million kids an episode during its run from 2005 to 2008. Aang were told is an Avatar a rare being who can control the elements and bring harmony to the clashing nations of Fire Water Earth and Air. Yeah its kid stuff and parents arent going to be enjoying any Pixar-style dual themes. This is strictly for the preteens who like their heroes young their morals simple and their villains clear. And Shyamalan delivers. Credit the director for emphasizing the films multiple fight scenes which crackle particularly for a kids movie. This could have played like Spy Kids Know Kung Fu but Ringer is a real martial arts prodigy and co-star Dev Patel (Slumdog Millionaire) trained for months. It shows. The film has come under fire from some Asian-American groups for not using more Asian stars. Ringer is white while the cartoon characters were Asian. Airbenders problem though is not in race. Its in the script written by Shyamalan. It can sound wooden particularly when he calls on an inexperienced Ringer to deliver soliloquies to incite rebellion. And for a first film Airbender seems oddly set up for a sequel particularly considering its going to get its brains bashed in at the box office by The Twilight Saga Eclipse also out this weekend. But for a kids movie Airbender delivers on multiple levels. And if the series does continue Shyamalan may find action a lot less frightening than the reaction to his horror of late.

"The Last Airbender A tale bent out of shape - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs 1 1/2 starsThe Last Airbender A tale bent out of shapeJune 30 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie critic (Courtesy of Paramount Pictures)According to ""The Last Airbender"" -- the latest 3-D offering in theaters yet barely functional in 2- or even 1- -- the worlds separate kingdoms are built around fire air water earth and impenetrable rock-hard exposition. Bringing those first four to the screen no doubt intrigued writer-director M. Night Shyamalan. But the fifth keeps messing him up as he struggles to find a rhythm for the quest involving a young leaders date with destiny. This turns into a series of flashbacks and voice-over explanations regarding the Northern Water Tribe (""where they openly practice waterbending"") or Prince Zuko exiled son of the Fire Lord whos... ...And I seem to be lost myself. I liked the original TV incarnation (Nickelodeon 2005-08) which was the first non-glib non-obnoxious series to capture my preteen sons interest. (It made up for all those installments of ""The Fairly OddParents."") Shot largely in Greenland the film version tells the first part of the series story in which Water Nation war orphans and siblings ( Nicola Peltz and Jackson Rathbone) discover frozen in ice young Aang ( Noah Ringer) the reincarnation of the avatar who can bend anything and restore harmony to the warring factions while teaching the upstart Fire Nation a lesson in humility. This is a world containing a flying furry bison and no end of battles waged by hurling fireballs and blasts of wind at your opponent. In one respect Shyamalan was an intriguing choice to adapt and helm this project Hes a grave soul which means hes in tune with the (relative) seriousness of the series. Think back though to ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs"" films from the directors pre-lost-mojo period. Shyamalans storytelling strengths are all about quietude indirect suspense and treating supernatural elements with everyday simplicity. ""The Last Airbender"" (they couldnt use the series ""Avatar"" title because another film got there first without all the bending) is more about marshaling extras and interpolating tons of computer-generated effects and keeping the factions straight. Its a tough sit. And the casting is peculiar Already the subject of some Asian-American protests the movie has made the good-guy Water Nation folks largely (and dully) Anglo with Mediterranean and Indian and other swarthy-type performers portraying the bad-guy Fire Folk. ( Dev Patel from ""Slumdog Millionaire"" plays Zuko whos at least conflicted about his role in world events.) You wouldnt notice the color-coding if the movie had any storytelling zip or visual magic. But not since Kyle MacLachlans whispered voice-overs about the worm and the spice and the worm IS the spice in ""Dune"" has a fantasy franchise tripped all over itself trying simply to please a fan base while creating a new one. mjphillipstribune.com 1 1/2 stars MPAA rating PG (for fantasy action violence) Cast Noah Ringer (Aang); Dev Patel (Prince Zuko); Nicola Peltz (Katara); Jackson Rathbone (Sokka); Aasif Mandvi (Commander Zhao) Credits Directed by M.

All the elements are there for a hit franchise starter --  a popular Nickelodeon anime property big-budget effects from ILM and a brand-name director in M. Night Shyamalan --  so why does ""The Last Airbender"" feel like the last Airbender movie auds will ever see? Part of it is miscasting as uneven acting undermines Shyamalans ultra-serious approach but the cardinal sin was entrusting someone so awkward with action then subjecting the flat result to a last-minute 3D conversion. With its built-in following pic should put helmer back in the ""Village"" ballpark with sequel odds only slightly better than those of ""The Golden Compass."" For all the success Nicks ""Avatar The Last Airbender"" animated series has enjoyed around the world its particulars are still relatively complex to be reduced to feature length spelling confusion for non-fans and frustration for the faithful. Dropping ""Avatar"" from its title to avoid confusion with the James Cameron pic and opening under the header ""Book One Water"" Shyamalans adaptation encompasses the first season of the critically acclaimed toon (and represents the helmers first for-hire gig after a string of disappointing original pics including ""Lady in the Water"" and ""The Happening""). Created by Westerners Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko to capitalize on the success of ""Naruto"" and other serialized martial-arts manga the series centers around a 12-year-old Airbender named Aang the gifted once-in-a-generation figure who possesses the ability (but not the training) to master all four elements Air Water Earth and Fire. Frozen in ice for 100 years Aang awakens to find the balance between the different nations disrupted by the Fire peoples ruthless desire to dominate. Only he can bring the four cultures together but first Aang must learn the other three fighting styles. With overtones of Tibetan Buddhism and various Eastern philosophies ""The Last Airbender"" is a pacifists action movie. We go to see the spectacle of benders harnessing their native elements in battle (an Earthbender might build a wall to block a hurtling fireball for instance) but instead the movie preaches a message of peace. Like his fellow Air nomads Aang (newcomer Noah Ringer) was raised by monks to follow a code of nonviolence. However in Aangs long absence Fire Lord Ozai (Cliff Curtis) exterminated his entire tribe. Now the young ""chosen one"" must choose between revenge and -- well its not entirely clear what the alternative is but something to do with uniting the hearts of all the nations. How do you package genocide for kids exactly? No sooner does the movie open -- with a budding Waterbender named Katara (Nicola Peltz) and her older brother (""The Twilight Sagas"" Jackson Rathbone) releasing Aang and his flying bison from a frozen sphere -- than fiery Prince Zuko (Dev Patel perhaps the best thing about the film) arrives to cart Aang and the elderly Water people off into slavery. Managing to escape Aang returns to his Air home to find nothing but bones before being captured again and thrown into a sort of concentration camp -- not the sort of situations you expect to find in a PG-rated kidpic. The rest of ""Airbenders"" world is fairly innocuous. The bending action is far from intense with rivals singeing and splashing one another with fire or water tricks while Aang does fancy tai chi moves to conjure up small whirlwinds. When more traditional fighting occurs its mostly of the harmless boot-to-the-butt variety. This is all enormously disappointing of course since the best we could hope for from a live-action ""Avatar"" adaptation is the mind-blowing equivalent of our first encounters with wire-fu rather than this cartoony nonsense. Even without one of Shyamalans trademark twist endings ""Airbender"" easily fits into the helmers portfolio of brooding genre inversions Here we expect an epic martial-arts movie and instead get a soul-searching adolescents decision to spare his enemies -- a character-driven approach thats ill served by the largely amateur cast. Shyamalan has worked wonders with child actors before but Ringer is no Haley Joel Osment delivering some fancy footwork but zero charisma in the pics key role. Most dialogue scenes are framed in tight Sergio Leone-style closeup emphasizing the actors wooden nature. At that proximity we notice that Rathbone never blinks; nor can he be counted on to deliver any of the comic relief of his animated counterpart. Humor is in short supply here and those elements that might leaven the atmosphere (such as Aangs winged lemur Momo) make brief but unmemorable appearances. Perhaps the only thing that can be said in Shyamalans favor is that he introduces a fantasy world that feels real -- a testament to his various heads of design. The four elemental nations represent centuries of culture with unique garments architecture and fighting styles to distinguish them (there also seems to be some sort of impenetrable logic about their ethnicities with people of color filling nearly all the secondary roles). Working with ""The Lord of the Rings"" d.p. Andrew Lesnie Shyamalan effectively melds his own moody overcast aesthetic with the epic look of that trilogy compromised somewhat by a retrofit conversion to stereoscopic 3D (not quite the headache of ""Clash of the Titans"" but certainly no improvement on 2D). A more bombastic John Williams-style score probably would have served the property better than music by longtime Shyamalan collaborator James Newton Howard which goes mellow when the movie needs it to soar.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Where to start with this one? How about this If any movie ever warranted a class-action lawsuit against the filmmakers its The Last Airbender. Not because its a terrible movie--though it is--but because its release as a 3-D film becomes false advertising a few seconds after a comin-atcha gush of water appears behind the Paramount logo. From there it becomes painfully obvious--even more painfully obvious than in Alice In Wonderland--that a few 3-D elements have been added to satisfy the current 3-D craze and the higher ticket prices they allow. Worse still the process makes the already-dark imagery darker and turns the action blurry. Viewers who see it in this form will pay more for an even shittier experience than the one they would have had in 2-D. And that would have been plenty shitty already. Adapting a well-regarded epic-in-scope Nickelodeon animated series writer-director M. Night Shyamalan has failed to do right both by his source material and his own strengths as a filmmaker. Set in a world in which the population is divided amid the four elements and some skilled practitioners can control those elements to their own ends the film vomits out complicated mythology in mouthfuls of exposition when not putting a supporting characters voiceover narration in charge of relaying major developments. Shyamalan manages a few striking images most of them involving otherworldly landscapes created in Greenland and Vietnam. But none of the care and craftsmanship evident in projects he originated even lousy ones like The Happening find their way into this movie. So what does that leave? A lot of headache-inducing CGI-effects sequences many scenes of children doing tai chi and some imperiled magical fish. Another filmmaker might have crafted the materials themes--which reference Buddhism and Christianity while exploring the relationship between good and evil--into a striking film. Shyamalan lets his unimpressive special effects do the work for him while coaxing performances from his young cast that make Jake Lloyds performance in The Phantom Menace look studied. (Star Noah Ringer who plays a messianic figure who might unite the warring forces delivers his lines as if reading a book report and his older co-stars dont fare much better.) The Last Airbender isnt that much different from the rest of this summers generally dire multiplex fare--from The A-Team to Jonah Hex--which started with established properties and half-decent ideas then cranked up the volume velocity and effects to the point where neither sense nor tender moments could escape. But it is remarkable in one respect Its the worst of them.

Last Airbender Last Airbender may be a career-killer for Shyamalan BY JOE WILLIAMS  Post-Dispatch Film Critic gt; joewilliamspost-dispatch.com gt; 314-340-8344 Jun 30 2010 (...) Paramount Pictures Noah Ringer plays Aang in Paramount Pictures ""The Last Airbender."" In the golden age of the kingdom called Hollywood there was harmony between the four elements writing acting editing and directing. When in the dying days of the millennium a phantom menace named George Lucas threw the kingdom out of balance a young image bender named M. Night Shyamalan fought back with his sixth sense. The elders hailed him as the chosen one -- but he was a charlatan. Shyamalans latest creation ""The Last Airbender"" is a toxic potion that will put children to sleep and kill his career.Based on an Asian-ish cartoon series called ""Avatar The Last Airbender"" the movie has been criticized for racially inappropriate casting but thats the least of its problems. The acting is laughable the effects are phony the editing is addled and the dialogue is disastrous.Steeped in pseudo-Buddhist blarney this confusing flick is yet another fantasy about a boy who is forced to save the world from a power-mad adversary. The title character is Aang (Noah Ringer) the last person on earth who can direct the energy of the wind. He also may be the prophesied ""avatar"" who can harmonize air with the competing elements of fire earth and water. Apparently thats a big deal which is why two warriors from the fire kingdom (Dev Patel of ""Slumdog Millionaire"" and Aasif Mandvi of um ""The Daily Show"") are racing to capture him. Aang is a young and reluctant messiah who still needs training to bend the other elements. So he treks to the ice kingdom with a water bender named Katara (Nicola Peltz) and her brother Sokka (Jackson Rathbone).Evidently ""The Last Airbender"" was intended to be the first of a four-part franchise. But youd have to have water on the brain to bet on it. Ringer a 12-year-old Texan who trained in tae kwon do has no charisma and his martial-arts skills are wasted in slo-mo action sequences set in digitized landscapes. Even the post-production 3-D is punchless. Instead of his usual twist ending M. Night Shyamalan has twisted ""The Last Airbender"" into a noose. Tags The Last Airbender M.

Movie Quiz Pittsburgher movie quiz for yunz Is Birdman star Michael Keaton the best actor with western Pennsylvania ties? Click here to play the Tribs tongue-in-cheek attempt to find out. There is incomprehensible and there is inexplicable and then there is ""The Last Airbender"" M. Night Shyamalans adaptation of the popular Nickelodeon cartoon ""Avatar The Last Airbender."" Not to be confused with James Camerons tale of tree-hugging blue people this saga revolves around (I think) a war-torn future world waiting for a messiah to unite it. But the screenplay (also by Shyamalan) is cluttered with so much gobbledygook exposition and confusing action that its impossible to grasp whats supposed to be going on for more than 15 seconds at a stretch. Who would have thought Shyamalan would come up with a movie that makes his ""Lady in the Water"" look positively sensible? Actually this seems to be the inevitable trajectory of a tremendously talented filmmaker who at some point convinced himself he could do no wrong. Just like ""Lady in the Water"" ""The Last Airbender"" suggests an artist so completely lost inside his creation that he has no idea what works and what doesnt. As it turns out nothing works here. The things Shyamalan once did so well especially in ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" perfectly modulating the rhythms of the scenes and patiently building tension have entirely abandoned him. The opening scenes introduce us to sister and brother Katara (Nicola Peltz) and Sokka (Jackson Rathbone) two members of Water Nation -- one of four nations that were once kept in balance by the mysterious Avatar. But when the Avatar went missing all hell broke loose as the Fire Nation declared war on the others including Air Nation and Earth Nation. Got all that (If not theres also a Yoda-like creature called ""the spirit dragon"" to confuse you even further.) Part of the problem here is that Shyamalan has tried to cram about three seasons of the cartoons plot points into this one movie including the story of the prince of Fire Nation (Dev Patel from ""Slumdog Millionaire"") who was cast out of the palace for being a wimp. The other bigger problem is that you dont care about any of these people whose motivations and personalities are impossible to discern. At some point a savior emerges Aang (Noah Ringer) a boy who can bend air -- i.e. make the wind knock people over -- and thus the Avatar who will bring peace to this universe. Sweeping his arms about him and prancing around the set the bald wide-eyed Aang spends a dismaying portion of the proceedings looking like hes practicing tai-chi. By the time the (mystifying) climax rolls around the movie has come to resemble an unwieldy hybrid of ""Little Buddha"" and ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon."" What else can one complain about The cheesy effects; the 3-D photography that barely looks three-dimensional; the fact that none of the cute-looking but vastly inexperienced lead actors has the chops to be carrying a large production Its a little early to be saying this but Id wager good money that you wont see a worse movie this year.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + ""The Last Airbender has had more bad karma than almost any movie deserves. Adapted from a popular Nickelodeon cartoon series called ""Avatar The Last Airbender the movie saw the first half of its title bigfooted by a certain James Cameron production late last year. The core fan base has been up in arms over the casting of white actors to play characters that on the show are anime-Asian (i.e. round-eyed but clearly based on Japanese drawing styles and other cultural markers).Writer-director M. Night Shyamalan has been in the doghouse since his last few films (""Lady in the Water ""The Happening) were roundly mocked; this is his first project-for-hire. And -- the final indignity -- ""Airbender has been put through the same postproduction 3-D rinse cycle that resulted in the cheapjack eyesore that was ""Clash of the Titans. The process is to genuine 3-D -- the kind you see in ""Toy Story 3 or ""How to Train Your Dragon -- what colorization is to color A ghoulish simulation.It would be heartening to report that Shyamalan has wrangled a good movie out of this litany of disaster but no such luck. ""The Last Airbender is dreadful an incomprehensible fantasy-action epic that makes the 2007 film ""The Golden Compass a similarly botched adaptation of a beloved property from another medium look like a four-star classic. Like ""Compass ""Airbender ends with a cliffhanger but dont hold your breath waiting for Chapter Two.The film should probably have stayed a cartoon; live-action kills it dead. Set in a fantasy world divided between the tribes of Earth Air Fire and Water -- each tribe having its mystical adepts who can control their assigned element -- ""The Last Airbender follows a brother and sister from the Water tribe Sokka (Jackson Rathbone one of the ""Twilight vampires) and Katara (Nicola Peltz) who discover a 12-year-old monk-child from the Air tribe frozen in a block of ice. His name is Aang (newcomer Noah Ringer) and he may be the Avatar who can unite the tribes against the warlike Fire Nation.I have no idea what Ringers ethnic makeup is and it doesnt matter The kids pretty good and perfectly believable as a Chosen One in the storylines pop mulch-up of Tibetan Buddhism. I wish I could say the same for Peltz and Rathbone whose crime again isnt that they are Anglo but just painfully dull.""Airbender is actually stolen by Dev Patel (the hero of ""Slumdog Millionaire) as the exiled Prince Zuko a full-on neurotic with a daddy complex who provides the movie with its greatest suspense. Is he a good guy or a bad guy? Patels a strong enough actor to keep us guessing.Otherwise its a tossup as to which is worse the script which regularly grinds to a halt to Explain Everything until the movie curls up and dies; the shockingly dingy camerawork; or the execrable 3-D. The latter comes in two modes barely noticeable as if the technicians set the knob at 1.3 and went out for lunch or actively irritating. Really Ive got winking-Jesus postcards that look better.Go see ""Airbender in 2-D if you must then and appreciate the pieces Patels tremulous Zuko a few mildly stunning CGI sets a six-legged flying bison swiped from Hayao Miyazaki and some single-take action sequences that might work if they were lit and choreographed with any finesse.

The Last Airbender Bomb to bad Director M. Night Shyamalan. Cast Noah Ringer Dev Patel Nicola Peltz. Rating PG for fantasy action violence. RELATED Last Airbender goes for family fun and comeback Movies based on kids TV Family fantasy films Martial arts movies Frosty movies Movie comebacks Failing that perhaps a coherent story with more rigid rules of engagement. Or better still a 7-year-old to explain things. (Wait I had that and it still didnt help.) ""The Last Airbender"" needs something because while the special effects are impressive enough M. Night Shyamalans film doesnt make a lick of sense. The story goes something like this The world is made up of four nations that align with the elements water earth fire and air. Some people can control or ""bend"" one element but only the Avatar can control all four. This also allows him to commune with the spirit world. But 100 years ago he went missing. And then he shows up frozen solid in a big ice cube accidentally released by Katara (Nicola Peltz) a water bender and her brother Sokka (Jackson Rathbone). It turns out that Aang (Noah Ringer) the Avatar is just a boy who ran away a century ago. But now the world is in disorder. For reasons never explained the Fire Nation has gone rogue and has spent the past 100 years at war with the other nations. (And its always Fire Nation by the way like Red Sox Nation. Weird but in the context of so much else thats weird here just an aside.) There is - and this wont be the last time - more to the story. Prince Zuko (Dev Patel) is on the hunt for the Avatar to prove to his father Fire Lord Ozai (Cliff Curtis) that he is not the pathetic loser his father takes him to be. But Commander Zhao (Aasif Mandvi) an ambitious sort also wants to bring the Avatar in to Ozai. A lot of unspoken drama going on there. If they had spoken some of it it might be easier to follow. Of course theres more. The Avatar is the last airbender (thus the title); Fire Nation has killed the rest. But he ran away before he could learn to master the other elements. So with two factions of Fire Nation in pursuit he Katara and Sokka head north where the serious-business water benders live to hone his skills. Naturally Aangs mere presence there ensures an all-out war which while under way also manages to involve spirits inhabiting the form of a couple of big fish romance with a princess for Sokka and a final acceptance of responsibility by Aang. (That last is pretty cool actually.) So. A lot to digest. Its hard to follow and the muddied look of the post-production transfer to 3-D doesnt help. Also bizarre is the manner in which the warring parties fight. A fire bender say will toss a fireball at an earth bender who will throw up a wall of dirt and block it. Meanwhile the fire bender will stand there and wait while the earth bender hits him with a rock or something. Its using elements as rock-paper-scissors but done by way of a sort of advanced form of martial arts. Why wait for your enemy? Why not just hit him in the head with a shovel while hes standing there? Ringer is a cute kid but the acting overall is stilted - Patel in particular evidently cant play angry in convincing fashion - and the action just jumps from one computer-generated set piece to another. Shyamalan either couldnt or wouldnt wrangle the film into more coherent form. He does manage however to end things on a note that promises at least one and possibly two sequels. So if nothing else the director who became famous for ""The Sixth Sense"" and has declined ever since still has a way with a surprise ending. Even if its not a pleasant surprise.

"Review The Last Airbender a muddled messy bore - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview The Last Airbender a muddled messy boreBy Christy LemireAssociated PressPosted 06/30/2010 113835 AM PDTUpdated 06/30/2010 022845 PM PDTClick photo to enlarge In this film publicity image released by Paramount Noah Ringer plays the heroic Aang in a scene from ""The Last Airbender."" (AP Photo/Paramount Zade Rosenthal) <<123>> Movie showtimes info The Twilight Saga Eclipse Everyone Else The Last Airbender Restrepo Interviews with the stars hot new trailers ""The Last Airbender"" is a joyless soulless muddled mess but the worst part of all doesnt come until the very end. Thats when it makes the clear suggestion that two more such movies are in store for us. Hopefully that wont happen. Based on the Nickelodeon animated series ""Avatar The Last Airbender"" this live-action fantasy adventure has epic scope and soaring ambitions exotic locations and a cast of thousands but manages to get everything wrong on every level. It is yet another misstep for writer-director M. Night Shyamalan whose career has been steadily on the decline since the marvel of ""The Sixth Sense"" (although ""Signs"" from 2002 tends to be underappreciated). A 2-D movie converted to 3-D ""The Last Airbender"" often has a smudged and blurry look about it as if theres some kind of schmutz on your clunky plastic glasses. Its bad enough that this is one of those glossy CGI monstrosities utterly divorced from anything resembling reality; transferred needlessly to 3-D its just plain ugly. This is especially true during moments of darkness or scenes that take place at night -- and thats a problem since a lot of pivotal stuff takes place at night. At least one can surmise as much. The script is so incomprehensible its often difficult to follow despite several instances of characters stopping whatever theyre doing to explain whats going on. Advertisement Then theres the acting which can charitably be described as stiff -- although Noah Ringer the young Chosen One at the center of the films mythology has a certain likable spunkiness about him. Too bad hes called on to say and do such ridiculous things. At the films start the world has been at war for nearly 100 years with the Fire Nation trying to take over the other nations of Air Water and Earth. The people who live in these tribes can manipulate or ""bend"" their respective elements hurl giant blobs of water or zap someone with a wave of flames. Its like an elaborate game of rock-paper-scissors though its hard to tell which bendy skill is preferable; they all seem kind of lame with Earth being the most cumbersome one. Apparently no one knows how to bend air anymore because the Fire Nation warlords eradicated everyone with that skill -- except one person a boy named Aang (Ringer) who arrives one day in a block of ice with his hulking six-legged bison buddy. A young waterbender named Katara (Nicola Peltz) and her older brother Sokka (Jackson Rathbone who plays the vampire Jasper in the ""Twilight"" movies) discover Aang and realize he may be the prophesied Avatar who can control all four elements and unite all four nations. Katara and Sokka promise to protect Aang from the various villains who are out to get him; this is a good thing because at least it gives them something to do. Theyd be totally bereft of personality otherwise. Theres Prince Zuko (""Slumdog Millionaire"" star Dev Patel) vengeful son of the power-hungry Fire Lord Ozai (Cliff Curtis); Zukos uncle and co-conspirator Iroh (Shaun Toub); and unscrupulous military man Commander Zhao (Aasif Mandvi). As for the airbending talent that makes the kid so desirable Its kind of like having leaf-blowers shoot out of your hands. Useful for yard work perhaps but not a whole lot of fun.
