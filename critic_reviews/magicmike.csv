The former tendency (in which characters start singing in the street joined by the sound of an orchestra) is the musical-as-fiction; the latter is the musical-as-virtual-documentary. The great modern example of the documentary-style musical is ""Saturday Night Fever"" a harshly realistic drama about Brooklyn youths that is turned into a musical (and a thrilling one) by the fact that they like to go to a nightclub and dance. Steven Soderberghs new film ""Magic Mike"" which opens tomorrow is a musical (and a terrific one) in the manner of ""Saturday Night Fever"" both in its choreographic elements and in its drama--which Soderbergh brings together in notable ways. Its a story of physical people and like the earlier film the new one is a showcase for actors who get to play characters who bring as much swing and rhythm to the action in their daily lives as they do to their dance-floor moves. Soderbergh does an even cannier job than does the earlier films director John Badham of creating images that coalesce with the off-stage choreography--and of bringing a distinctive and personal perspective to the world that his characters inhabit and to the lives that they live. And Soderbergh built the movie around the experiences of his star (and co-producer) Channing Tatum who had a stint as a stripper in his youth; the drama has the authority and sharp focus of lived-in knowledge. (But nothing has quite the epochal kick of Badhams still-exhilarating film which revealed a star a world and a kind of music all together in sync with history.) Tatum plays a male stripper in Tampa who has skills (he makes custom furniture) brains (he helps the strip-club impresario with the books) and a dream (he wants to start a furniture business and has a serious plan). Hes also doing a construction job to save up some money but the fastest money comes from the ones and fives that are tucked into his thong by the hordes of women mainly young women whose fantasies he stokes as a part of the group that the impresario Dallas (played with eye-popping exuberance by Matthew McConaughey) calls ""the cock-rockin kings of Tampa."" And the fault line from which the drama grows is that the same skills that make Mike magic on-stage at the strip club also make him uneasy with that very success. From the start the movie is joyfully kinetic--it shows Dallas on-stage doing a number of controlled frenzy--but the more surprising movement comes in the next scene from seeing Mike stride from his S.U.V. to negotiate with his construction boss and from there to climb to a roof (matched by a delicious crane shot) and to prance across it while preparing to tile. There Mike befriends Adam (Alex Pettyfer) a young newcomer whom he meets again by chance outside a nightclub and brings him in--relying on his good looks to drum up business for the strip club and hiring him as a factotum who nonetheless gets thrown onto the stage at a moment of need and takes to the job and the milieu with enthusiasm. Meanwhile Adams sister Brooke (Cody Horn) a medical assistant with her feet on the ground provides a forceful voice of practical reason which makes her all the more attractive to Mike and keeps her just out of his reach. (The role of Brooke is written with a lovely understated frankness and Horn plays it with a rare down-to-earth self-possession.) Some of the movies most splendid--and most spendidly choreographed--moments involve Mike and Brooke just-friends with a common interest in the naive and increasingly headstrong Adams well-being as they talk at length at a dune party or at an amusement park. With a long telephoto-lens pan shot for the one and an endlessly gliding tracking shot for the other Soderbergh (doing his own cinematography under his usual pseudonym Peter Andrews) turns long dialogues into memorable varieties of action. Yet what gives the movie substance to match its vigorously nimble style is its establishment of a fearsome dividing line and the crucial decisions that it imposes on those who would dare to cross--as Brooke explains to Mike there are ""the vampires and everyone else""--people who work day jobs and people who work in the world of entertainment at night. Its the world that lures Adam with (as Dallas says) ""women money and fun"" and inevitably with other ecstatic enticements such as drugs and violence. Early on Mike flings down the gauntlet to Adam--""Do you want to be on the inside or the outside?""--and the decisive step and the price of taking it is what really grabs Soderberghs attention. Theres plenty of high-energy stage business set to a virtual wall-to-wall soundtrack of pounding rock but Soderbergh films it with a remarkably ambivalent fascination. For all the creativity that goes into the ever-routine world of stripping he offers little joie de spectacle; indeed the relentless and frenetic cries of the ravenous women at the strip shows wouldnt be out of place on the soundtrack of ""The Birds."" Soderbergh clearly admires the performers daring commitment energy and skill but he also sees the performance as a get-rich-quick scheme a shortcut even a fraud that always promises but never delivers. Its an apt perspective for a filmmaker who keeps retiring and returning; and in Mikes climactic confrontations with the sharks of dirty businesses set against his dream of becoming an independent artisan the filmmaker confronts his own dilemma. The yearning for ordinariness and the yearning to escape from the ordinary--the quest for fantasy and the dream of feeling that one has begun ones real life--are the opposing energies that give the movie its constant tension.

Why did they ever get made? Didnt anyone know how bad they were from the start? Then there is ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" which provokes wonderment pure and simple. How did it ever get made? Did the people who financed and created it know how magical and piercingly beautiful it would be? They couldnt have known at the outset. Benh Zeitlins debut feature evokes life in a surpassingly strange corner of Louisiana through the ecstatic spirit of a 6-year-old black girl named Hushpuppy. Theres no trace of calculation only artistic ambitions and hopes that have come to fruition in the years finest film thus far. Most of the action takes place in the Bathtub a tiny community of impoverished locals--black and white some descended from Cajun or Indian fishermen--in South Louisianas bayou country. Because the Bathtub lies outside the levee system it will overflow in an impending hurricane and Hushpuppy knows as well as everyone else that ramshackle homes and precious possessions will be swept away. ""Any day now the fabric of the universe is comin unraveled"" she declares. Hushpuppys mind is all aswirl with animist signs and ominous portents--consuming fire; another ""Iced Age""; the mythical beasts of the title derived from the extinct aurochs that threaten rampant destruction. She speaks in quasipoetic phrases that might seem impossibly pretentious if they werent so rich and original and if the child speaking them--a nonprofessional named Quvenzhane Wallis--werent so madly enchanting. (Hushpuppys father a passionate violent and grievously ill man named Wink is played by another astonishingly eloquent nonprofessional Dwight Henry. In fact the entire cast is nonprofessional.) ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" directed by Benh Zeitlin follows six-year-old Hushpuppy (Quvenzhane Wallis) as she deals with her fathers ailing health and an epic storm. Watch a clip from the film. Video Courtesy of Fox Searchlight. Language is key to the enchantment of the film as a whole. Not just the words which the director and Lucy Alibar adapted from Ms. Alibars stage play ""Juicy and Delicious"" but the stylized cinematic language of Ben Richardsons images as edited by Crockett Doob and Affonso Goncalves. This is a low-budget production that looks like a million dollars greatly multiplied. Fireworks flash and sparkle. Hands thrust into a stream come up with thrashing catfish. (Wink has built a boat for himself from an asthmatic outboard a truck body and 55-gallon drums lashed into service as pontoons.) In a floating crab shack and whorehouse called Elysian Fields dancers drift through a humid haze to the strains of Fats Wallers ""Until the Real Thing Comes Along."" And when the hurricane comes along its the visual equivalent of what Noah in ""The Green Pastures"" calls ""a complete storm"" a deluge that tests the communitys attachment to its precarious place and endangered way of life. ""Get in here"" a good-natured waitress at Elysian Fields tells Hushpuppy who in the midst of everything else has been searching for her dead mother. ""Lemme show you a magic trick."" The whole movie is a magic trick and part of the magic is that it can be seen in various ways. The setting provides a metaphorical divide between rich and poor ""Aint that ugly over there?"" Hushpuppy says of the industrial landscape on the other side of the levee. ""We got the prettiest place on earth."" (The divide is undermined when wily residents of the flood-beset Bathtub figure out a way to drain it more quickly than Mother Nature might have planned.) The film can equally be seen as an ethnographic project guided mainly by two white Americans Mr. Zeitlin and Ms. Alibar with an unquenchable interest in how people of a remote region live think speak and sing. The sound track is a treasure. Even the kitchen implements have an exotic allure. But the best way to see ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" is to sit back let its pleasures wash over you and forget at least for the duration of the experience about making distinctions between whats real--and shockingly harsh--in Hushpuppys life and whats boiling in her imagination. Scenes stay vivid long after the experience has ended Wink raging against the storm by shooting at it with his rifle; Hushpuppy tracing a record of her being like a cave girl scratching pictograms (""Once there was a Hushpuppy and she lived with her daddy in the Bathtub""); a boozy neighbor bottle to lips stepping out of his front door into deep water; those aurochses on the march; Hushpuppys shrill trills of joy and the slow burn of her comprehension as she sees her father where hed feared to be in a hospital bed plugged into the wall. At its core Mr. Zeitlins film is a tale of daughter and father struggling to survive. Wink is not the father that Hushpuppys vanished mother would have wanted him to be. He drinks and gives his little girl ample tastes too. He feeds her slops--""Share wit the dog"" he barks--and knocks her around in the course of loving and trying to protect her. There are no boundaries between rage and love in their life and one of the productions many mysteries is how a man with no dramatic training--Mr. Henry runs a bakery in the town where the movie was shot--could have delivered such a magnificent performance. For Winks daughter--the angel-faced fiercely focused girl that Quvenzhane Wallis plays with uncanny grace--he is the source of all wisdom as well as love. A psychologist might say that he holds her in his thrall by keeping her off balance with wildly unpredictable behavior but Hushpuppy knows only that she adores him and believes in him and will survive thanks to the lessons she has learned from him. Hers is an unconditional love and its not so far removed from what you may feel for this stirring and ultimately thrilling movie. ENLARGE Matthew McConaughey and Channing Tatum in Magic Mike Warner Bros. Pictures Matthew McConaughey and Channing Tatum star in ""Magic Mike"" a film that follows a male stripper as he teaches a younger performer the ropes. Watch a clip from the film. Video Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures. Magic Mike ""You dont need to talk"" an appreciative female tells Channing Tatums male stripper Magic Mike. ""Just look pretty."" He looks pretty indeed whether or not hes on stage in a tacky Tampa club doing spectacular gyrations in charmingly silly routines. Mr. Tatum whose talents have been the subject of debate also makes Mike genuinely affecting not to mention articulate within the bounds of a sketchy script. The process is called acting and the man in the title role of Steven Soderberghs flashy not-so-trashy entertainment does it so well that the debate should be officially ended. Mike isnt just a fancy dancer but a striver with dreams of becoming an entrepreneur and a mentor who takes an aimless kid Alex Pettyfers Adam under his wing and gets him a job at the club. (The kid who comes to be known as The Kid is a fictional version of Mr. Tatum during a brief period in his life.) Matthew McConaughey dominates every scene hes in as Dallas the clubs malign owner and exultantly preening onstage host. The film which the director shot handsomely on a tight schedule feels partly improvised looks like ""Cabaret"" stripped of the Weimar grit and Fosse wit and plays like ""Boogie Nights"" without the porn miasma. Its cheerfully raunchy and delivers the goods for fans of male beefcake though with more innocence along with some sadness than would appear at first blush. Thats not to say the drama goes much deeper than the skin on vivid display. In the department of emotional development ""Magic Mike"" turns the unlikely trick of disembodiment. ENLARGE Mark Wahlberg and the title character voiced by Seth MacFarlane in Ted Universal Studios Mark Wahlberg Mila Kunis and Seth MacFarlane star in MacFarlanes first feature-length comedy ""Ted"" about what happens when a boy and his stuffed bear grow up. Watch a clip from the film. Video Courtesy of Universal Pictures. Ted Everyone admires economies of scale but an economy of scale might have been the saving grace of Seth MacFarlanes debut feature. ""Ted"" is often hilarious sometimes sweet and in the spirit of ""Family Guy"" consistently raunchy. Yet its seriously overextended and as the premise wears ever thinner frantically overproduced. (The director worked from a script credited to him Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild.) As you probably know by now--the movies marketing campaign has been intense--Mark Wahlberg is John Bennett an amiable guy though in the spirit of Peter Griffin not super-bright. Ted an animated creature voiced by Mr. MacFarlane is the potty-mouthed and compulsively womanizing teddy bear who has been Johns best buddy since childhood. Theirs is a beautiful romance albeit a turbulent one threatened only by Johns love for Lori Collins (Mila Kunis) a beautiful human whos been waiting impatiently for John to grow up and put aside the childish thing that continues to rule his life. Ms. Kunis makes a strong case for intraspecies relationships though she lacks the sparkle of some previous performances and its great fun to watch John and Ted in the deliciously casual course of their dailiness or at one startling flash point in the agony of duking it out. Yet everything goes on too long--Teds carousing Loris watchful waiting Johns wistful indecision. The movie started to lose me around the time of a silly plot turn involving Norah Jones then lost me completely during an interminable car chase--car chases being the standard studio solution for script problems--followed by an out-of-scale sequence at Fenway Park. Ted doesnt age but ""Ted"" does. People Like Us Going on too long seems to be the disease of the week; its certainly what brings this movie down though the going on here stems from a surfeit of implausible plot that suffocates the main characters and the excellent actors who play them. ""People Like Us"" is a debut feature by Alex Kurtzman; he wrote the script with Roberto Orci and Jody Lambert. Although the trailer lays the whole thing out in unseemly detail Ill be more circumspect and say only that Chris Pines Sam a salesman with suddenly desperate financial problems discovers family secrets after the death of his estranged father who has left a bundle of cash to be given to someone Sam has never heard of. Mr. Kurtzman is good with actors and the film begins promisingly with Mr. Pines portrait of a fast-talking man on the edge. Sam talks so fast that I wondered if hed fall victim to what Ive begun to consider since the frenzied debut of ""The Newsroom"" as the Aaron Sorkin syndrome. No need to worry about that though; he slows down when the movie slows to a crawl. The hitherto unknown someone played with verve and touching simplicity by Elizabeth Banks is Frankie a single mother and a recovering alcoholic who tends bar at a luxury hotel. (In this script glib juxtapositions pass for dilemmas.) It seems ridiculous to dance around plot details when the movie allows the audience to get ahead of the story and to stay there as events laboriously unfold. Still all youll learn here is that Sam by misrepresenting himself to Frankie from the start sustains a state of suspense that is not only unsustainable but manifestly nonsensical. Two actors are appealing in smaller roles Michael Hall DAddario as Frankies young son and Olivia Wilde as Hannah Sams girlfriend. The wonderful Michelle Pfeiffer is not so wonderfully stuck with playing Lillian Sams mother. To lend Lillian gravitas the movie equips her with glasses and a heart condition.

But when I tell you that ""Magic Mike"" is a Steven Soderbergh-directed drama about aging self-destruction and the recession you envision something completely different. Both descriptions are accurate -- which is why preview screenings have been filled with people curious to see the latest Soderbergh movie as well as those more interested in the bachelorette party side of things. (Take a guess which faction is louder.) I dont know that either group will be completely satisfied but ""Magic Mike"" does a better job of mixing Chippendales-style guilty pleasures with reality-based cautionary tales than you might expect. To use a marketing phrase that Warner Bros. didnt Channing Tatum is Magic Mike a 30-year-old Tampa entrepreneur who earns most of his income at an all-male revue but has dreams of bigger things. Hes skilled at crafting custom furniture for example and he works for a roofing company by day. Given the right opportunities or even just a reasonable bank loan he could make something of himself. And hell need to. He knows he wont be young forever. The clubs owner Dallas (Matthew McConaughey) once a stripper himself but now primarily an emcee is a constant reminder of that. The other performers in Mikes troupe are not vital to the story but they are named Ken (Matt Bomer) Tito (Adam Rodriguez) Tarzan (Kevin Nash) and Richie (Joe Manganiello). The DJ a fat and flamboyant drug enthusiast is named Tobias (Gabriel Iglesias). The guys backstage interplay often filmed with fly-on-the-wall long takes and overlapping dialogue feels authentically jocular somewhere between a Broadway theater dressing room and a frat house. Also Check Out Magic Mike Vs. The Fully Monty Into this world comes Adam (Alex Pettyfer) an unmotivated 19-year-old college dropout whos been crashing at his sister Brookes (Cody Horn) apartment while waiting for something to fall into his lap. He didnt have stripping in mind but he takes to it like a duck to water when he is thrust onstage without warning like Elmer Fudd in one of those opera cartoons. Mike promises Brooke hell watch out for the kid -- The Kid soon becomes his stage name -- and protect him from the pitfalls of popularity. Soderbergh has a blast staging the performance scenes which are the non-full-monty variety that employ borderline-campy props costumes and choreography. (That perhaps is the chief difference between male and female stripper audiences women like to see a show; men are just there for the nudity.) No judgments are made about the dancers or the women who lust after them. The environment isnt portrayed as sleazy or at least no more so than anything that happens in Tampa. Its just fun The sleaze is offstage where it is viewed at first with matter-of-factness -- oh hey look Mikes booty call Joanna (Olivia Munn) loves recruiting a second girl for threeways -- but with increasing alarm. Adam gets reckless as would any 19-year-old who suddenly finds himself a sex symbol and Mike struggles to keep his promise to Brooke. The basic trajectory of the plot isnt revelatory but the screenplay (by producer Reid Carolin) offers a few tweaks in the way it handles it. ""Magic Mike"" might be less sexy than you want a stripper movie to be and less potent than a drama should be. Its not ""Boogie Nights"" -- but neither is it ""Showgirls."" Soderbergh weaves back and forth between dizzying fantasy and harsh reality and only sometimes captures the full impact of either one. But its surprising how quietly dramatic some of the non-stripping scenes are and how effective Tatum is in them. His scenes with Cody Horn in particular are naturalistic almost documentary-like in their believability. Mike comes across as a smart dude a decent bro a talking beef slab with a good head on his waxed shoulders. Whod have thought this film would be a showcase for Channing Tatums acting talent?

Comments (2) Magic Mike Recommended Video Rated R  110 minutes  2012 Steven Soderbergh seems to have modeled this crowd-pleasing tale about male strippers in Tampa on such gritty 1970s comedies as Bob Rafelsons Stay Hungry and Michael Ritchies The Bad News Bears whose broad comedy was undercut by an unsentimental view of economic recession. The primary characters here are a vain up-and-coming stripper (Alex Pettyfer) who sleeps on his sisters couch because he cant afford his own place a bourgeoning entrepreneur (Channing Tatum) who manages three separate businesses when he isnt stripping and a seemingly dimwitted emcee (Matthew McConaughey often hilarious) who turns out to be a shrewd accountant. The dance numbers choreographed by Allison Faulk are inventive and athletic but not really erotic; Soderbergh never lets you forget that for these men dancing is above all a job.

"Magic Mike A story with lots of strippers but no heart of gold |       NJ.com comments Magic Mike A story with lots of strippers but no heart of gold Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on June 29 2012 at 840 AM View/Post Comments Claudette BariusChanning Tatum is the Mike in ""Magic Mike."" Mikes got a day job as a roofer. But in Tampa under that sun its not a job hes eager to go to most days. So he tries to reinvent himself as an entrepreneur slowly putting together his start-up costs from his cash-only night job. That would be stripping as Magic Mike the hip-hop hunk who has all the single ladies hearts -- or at least their dollar bills. Although strip clubs long ago became a cliche in cable dramas and action movies -- theyre the easiest way to add nudity without having to write characters -- male strippers havent gotten much screen time. (Well forget -- or try to -- Christopher Atkins in ""A Night in Heaven."") Well heres Channing Tatum to change that. In real life fresh out of high school and looking for work Tatum did some time in breakaway pants and G-strings. He made some money and amassed some war stories -- a few of which he shared with Steven Soderbergh while shooting ""Haywire."" Now Tatum and Soderbergh have taken that sweaty sequined inspiration and turned it into a movie. Theyve had the help of Reid Carolin Tatums business partner -- like Mike Tatum is a bit of a forward-thinking entrepreneur himself. Its Carolins first script though and it shows. Some of the characters and situations -- soulless managers naive ingenues -- are showbiz-movie cliches with an a-star-is-porn twist. Others seem more specifically borrowed. (Theres a scene with Mike looking for a loan that feels like a watered-down version of the great one in ""Boogie Nights"" when Don Cheadle goes hat in hand to the bank.) Actually quite a bit of ""Magic Mike"" has the thematic feel of ""Boogie Nights"" since it looks at a sexual subculture that encourages quick camaraderie (because no one else accepts what you do) and makes the bizarre feel normal (as long as you stay inside its mirrored walls). Its a much lighter movie than that Paul Thomas Anderson masterpiece though and Soderbergh has a much lighter style. Although as usual he plays with odd angles and primary colors -- going for acrid yellows in the daytime scenes deep reds and blues during a druggy party -- its a sleek straightforward shoot. Tatum though is low-key and believable as Mike -- it was a smart move back in ""21 Jump Street"" to embrace his amiable not-too-bright image -- while Alex Pettyfer (last years ""breakout star"" who turned out to be more of a meteorite) is fine in the underwritten role of ""the Kid."" As the sleazy club owner Matthew McConaughey tries out another one of his Im-a-character-actor-now portrayals -- but Im still unconvinced. You can still catch him acting weighing every gesture and imagining our reactions to them. Best of all though may be Cody Horn as the Kids big sister and inevitably Mikes love interest. I know there will be an urge to dismiss her simply because she calls the head of the studio ""Daddy"" but she has real talent and theres something in her eyes and the set of that underbite that telegraphs determination. The movies story of course is sometimes just telegraphed with the script avoiding some obvious subject matter. (Its a crew of half-a-dozen Chippendales-style strippers -- and theyre all straight?). And yes many lessons are learned before the final fade-out. But if youre looking for a romance with 100 percent prime beefcake? Get your singles out and ready ladies. ""Magic Mike"" is in the house. Ratings note The film contains nudity sexual situations substance abuse strong language and violence. Magic Mike (R) Warner Bros. (115 min.) Directed by Steven Soderbergh. With Channing Tatum Alex Pettyfer Cody Horn Matthew McConaughey. Now playing in New Jersey.

James Adams From Fridays Globe and Mail (Includes correction) Published Friday Jun. 29 2012 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Jun. 29 2012 930AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Steven Soderbergh Written by Reid Carolin Starring Channing Tatum Alex Pettyfer and Olivia Munn Classification R Genre drama Year 2012 Country USA Language English Some have greatness thrust upon them; others are distinguished by the greatness of their thrusting. These would be the strippers of the Xquisite Male Dance Revue in Tampa Fla. where there are more six packs on-stage than on a skid at a beer store.Its here before a panting all-female audience where much of the action in Magic Mike a cheeky but finally familiar cautionary tale from the reliably protean Steven Soderbergh occurs. The title also is the nom de theatre of the Xquisites main attraction played by the bodacious Channing Tatum (who as we all must know by now performed prior to stardom in an all-male exotic dance troupe in the late 1990s). Screen grab from the online trailer for the film ""Magic Mike"" Movies Magic Mike The official trailer Joe Manganiello Movies Video True Blood star shirtless again for Magic Mike Dry-humping and grinding though isnt Mikes only gig. By day the 30-year-old hunk fancies himself ""an entrepreneur"" (his term if not the banks) dabbling in auto detailing event management custom furniture design and roofing. While working a construction date Mike encounters Adam (Alex Pettyfer) a feckless penniless 19-year-old whos blown a football scholarship and is now sharing an apartment with his decidedly more level-headed sister Brooke (Cody Horn).Aided and abetted by Dallas Xquisites exquisitely sleaze-bucket paterfamilias (played to spray-tanned bikini-waxed perfection by Matthew McConaughey) Mike takes Adam under his wing to demonstrate the tricks of the skin trade. In short order like Hugh Hefner to Viagra Adam is embracing the roar of the crowd the smell of the thong and the delirium of easy money limitless no-strings copulation and fab drugs. Mike however isnt so sure. Yeah hes had sex with 679 women (including Olivia Munn a psychology grad student with a thing for threesomes); hes had more five-dollar bills stuffed in his thong than treats in a pinata; and Dallas is promising him equity (10 per cent 7.5 per cent whatever) in a club he plans to open in Miami. But is that all there is? The questioning and the doubts become more urgent as he finds himself drawn to Adams clear-eyed straight-talking sister.Okay as plots go this is nothing to write Chippendales about. Indeed the story arc and the dilemmas therein are largely just one more modest elaboration of themes already mined in movies like Saturday Night Fever Showgirls Lifeguard American Gigolo and Boogie Nights. A wise wag once described American television as essentially ""a civics lesson in a bikini"" and thats Magic Mike in a nutshell - ass-flashing high spirits laughs buff bods and bawdiness at the start followed by tsk-tsking and the discreet wagging of fingers.Two things do redeem the film somewhat. One is the near-uniform excellence of the cast led by Tatum who has a compelling eminently watchable aw-shucks charisma and newcomer Horn as the cute concerned sister. The other is the easy naturalistic flow and ebb of Reid Carolins dialogue which gives none of his characters a vocabulary or insights above his or her station.Soderberghs direction - hes also the cinematographer - is largely loose-limbed the film enlivened with bravura moments including a decidedly spacey eye-twisting orgy scene near the end. Also intriguing is the sulfurous glow he gives to the films exterior scenes invoking both the allure and the toxicity of Floridas seductive surfaces.Moviegoers looking for a raunchy romp in Magic Mike are going to be disappointed. Its more anatomy of a work-place than hedonistic hoedown a depiction of a world where the bump for all the cheap thrills it affords audiences of sorority sisters and office assistants is as much a grind as any other job.WHEN BOYS DECIDE TO GROW UPTheres been no shortage of Hollywood films in which men-children grow dissatisfied vaguely or acutely with the highs of hedonism - those breasts that beach these drugs this crowd - and cast about for a life rather than a lifestyle.Lifeguard (1976). Sam Elliott is Rick Carlson a 32-year-old lifeguard who re-examines his life of sun surf sand and sex when hes invited to his 15-year highschool reunion.Saturday Night Fever (1977). Tony Manera memorably played by John Travolta wonders if being king of the disco dance floor really can be the ticket out of Brooklyn and his job in a paint store.American Gigolo (1980). Julian (Richard Gere) has the bossest collection of Giorgio Armani suits superb art and a great apartment. He also gets paid (lots) to have sex with wealthy women. Then he goes and spoils it all by fallling in love with Lauren Hutton.Boogie Nights (1997). Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg) has greatness stirring in his pants greatness unleashed when he becomes Dirk Diggler Porn Star Extraordinaire in 70s El-Lay. Cocaine and amphetamines lay him low however.Crazy Stupid Love (2011) Jacob Palmer (Canadas Ryan Gosling) dresses like a dream never lacks for the infallible pick-up line in the chic-est clubs and lives on an inheritance. Then he goes and spoils it all by falling in love with Emma Stone.Editors note An earlier online version of this article misspelled Canadian actor Ryan Goslings name.

Photo Credit Warner Bros. Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A veteran male stripper takes a naive newcomer under his wing. BOTTOM LINE This smart funny compassionate look at a well-oiled subculture is a worthy heir to ""Saturday Night Fever"" and one of the years best surprises. CAST Channing Tatum Alex Pettyfer Matthew McConaughey Cody Horn LENGTH 200 ""Magic Mike"" starring Channing Tatum as a stripper making the most of his assets brings all the beef you might expect but has plenty going on upstairs too. Its not an overly musky romance but a window into a much-mocked subculture more ""Saturday Night Fever"" than ""Dirty Dancing."" Its one of the years best surprises and so is its frequently underrated star. Though unmistakably directed by Steven Soderbergh in his subversive-chic style ""Magic Mike"" belongs to Tatum playing an older version of the teenage Tampa stripper he briefly was. (He also co-produced with writer Reid Carolin.) That may be why this film feels so authentic with details no outsiders research could provide. Tatums Mike roughly 30 lives the wild life We first see him waking after a threesome. But unlike young Adam (Alex Pettyfer) the newest recruit to Tampas Club Xquisite Mike is saving his sweaty singles to start his own business.

Much of the freaky fun in ""Magic Mike"" comes from the blush-worthy dance sequences choreographed with low-rent panache by Alison Faulk (currently handling Madonnas 2012 tour) and performed without a shred of embarrassment by Joe Manganiello as the well-endowed Richie and Kevin Nash as the near-simian Tarzan among others. Matthew McConaughey as the clubs leather-harnessed ringmaster Dallas delivers a born-for-this performance and nearly steals the show with a spread-legged striptease to KISS ""Calling Dr. Love."" But its Tatum who carries the film not just with his sculpted muscles but with a sensitive almost heartbreaking performance. Adams sister Brooke (Cody Horn) keeps him at arms length and even his regular booty call Joanna (Olivia Munn) tells him to shut up and ""just look pretty."" Like the porn stars in ""Boogie Nights"" Mike doesnt realize where he ranks until the world reminds him.

Photo As we face yet another summer of brooding superheroes its Magic Mike to the rescue Hes got the civilian alter ego and the acrobatic skills to rival Spidey or Batman -- but this guy does his best work when hes taking off a silly outfit (preferably slowly and set to the grinding beat of Ginuwines ""Pony""). Like the ""c - - k-rockin Kings of Tampa"" the all-male strip revue in which Mike (Channing Tatum) is the star attraction Steven Soderberghs breezy dramedy serves up something for every taste. Its got funny and loose guy-bonding moments a bit of romance and some really first-rate dancing much of it by Tatum himself (whose stripper past reportedly inspired the screenplay). PHOTOS CHANNING TATUMS RISE TO STARDOM MAGIC MIKE OUTSTRIPPING THE COMPETITION IN ADVANCE TICKET SALES Its also terrific-looking as youd expect from Soderbergh who gives the Florida exterior shots in ""Magic Mike"" a bleached-out Polaroid vibe and finds the perfect middle ground between glam and sleazy for his depiction of small-city nightclubs. Oh were you interested in something else? Greased-up abs and tearaway pants perhaps? Theres an eye-popping amount of burlesque beefcake on display here all done with raunchy good humor. Its like ""The Full Monty"" except with guys you actually want to see take it all off or ""Boogie Nights"" minus the angst and the body count. Well maybe a little angst. The affable Mike holds down various jobs but at 30 is dreaming of starting his own business crafting found-object furniture (which doesnt appear to be catching on in Tampa; too bad hes not based in Brooklyn). In the meantime he works days in construction where he meets Adam (Alex Pettyfer) a 19-year-old screw-up whose ex-jock bod makes him ripe for recruitment to Mikes more lucrative gig exotic dancing at Club Xquisite. ""This is the Kid"" Mike dubs Adam when introducing him to the stripper crew whose pre-show prep routine is charmingly mundane. Big Dick Richie (Joe Manganiello) sits at the sewing machine putting the finishing touches on a gold thong; a behemoth named Tarzan (Kevin Nash) asks if his legs look ashy. But the real draw -- almost outshining Tatums high-voltage appeal -- is Matthew McConaughey in what might be his best role yet as preening club owner Dallas. Borrowing a catchphrase from his iconic ""Dazed and Confused"" character -- ""all right all right all riiiiight"" -- and more chiseled and leathery than ever he schools the Kid (""Whos got the c - - k? You do They dont"" ) and schemes about upgrading to big-time Miami. The Kids new lifestyle doesnt sit well with his protective older sister and roommate Brooke (a naturalistic Cody Horn). But even she cant totally resist goofy Mike -- Tatum is nothing if not disarming -- who assures her hell look after her little brother and makes her jaw drop just slightly when she catches one of his routines at the club. Because watching this guy dance is undeniably thrilling even to a cynic like Brooke and Soderberghs camera adores him. Bathing his star in violet lights and sexy lens flares the director showcases the moves that obviously would have served Tatum well as a stripper and brought him mainstream fame in 2006s street-dancing movie ""Step Up."" (If you ask me there should be a clause in his contract that stipulates he will bust out these skills in every movie. Tell me ""G.I. Joe"" or ""Dear John"" wouldnt have been much improved.) But Tatums co-stars deserve a lot of credit too for being incredibly game -- and limber -- for the extensively choreographed ""Flashdance""-reminiscent dance numbers cheesy get-ups and wolf-whistling female extras. Manganiello whose oft-naked ""True Blood"" character has already netted him a devoted following has some of the best stage moments like a fireman routine gone awry and a silhouetted pose that confirms the provenance of his characters nickname. Matt Bomer (""White Collar"") is also in fine form as a dancer Ken whose signature performance plays off his doll-like face. The slightly wooden Pettyfer is at his best onstage learning to work the crowd. As you might expect theres a dark-side-of-hedonism turn as the Kids partying gets out of control -- but thankfully Soderbergh doesnt wallow in it. Theres no shortage of tragic movies about the adult-entertainment world out there already. Instead his tone stays mainly with the sunny and yes Magic Mike who you just know will always land on his feet -- even when back-flipping off a stage into a mob of squealing sorority girls.

Starring Channing Tatum Alex Pettyfer Matt Bomer Matthew McConaughey Joe Manganiello Wendi McLendon-Covey Olivia Munn Betsy Brandt Mircea Monroe Riley Keough Director Steven Soderbergh Release Opened Jun 29 2012  Editorial Review Hes charming the pants off youBy Ann HornadayFriday June 29 2012A mellow low-slung charm propels ""Magic Mike"" Steven Soderberghs film starring Channing Tatum as a male stripper that is partly based on Tatums real-life experience. What might have been a hysterically pitched version of ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" or a gritty expos of a seamy underworld instead is gratifyingly underplayed. Its a nicely balanced blend of comedy drama and athletic dancing that plies its trade with winking unforced self-assurance. In the parlance of the trade ""Magic Mike"" makes it rain but never looks like its working hard for the money. Tatum plays the title character now in his 30s who for years has been a headline act at a Tampa strip club called Xquisite but is ready to strike out on his own in a custom-furniture business. When Mike meets a 19-year-old college dropout named Adam (Alex Pettyfer) Mike takes the young man under his wing and introduces him to the easy money flowing booze and nonstop booty calls of his lifestyle. Soon Adam -- nicknamed ""The Kid"" by Xquisites seedy owner Dallas (played with delicious drawling oiliness by Matthew McConaughey) -- is bumping vamping and fondling his nether regions with the rest of Mikes posse a collection of mild-mannered guys who are as comfortable with pancake makeup and waxing as they are with the pumps they use to enhance their natural gifts. Soderbergh films those backstage rituals and banter with glancing offhand understatement a style that gives ""Magic Mike"" a great deal of its appeal. Made in the lighthearted unfussy vein of Soderberghs ""Oceans"" movies and ""Haywire"" this midsummer programmer has less in common with such antecedents as ""Striptease"" and ""Boogie Nights"" than with ""Lifeguard"" a little-known 1976 gem in which Sam Elliott played an aging beach bum contemplating his future (and looking mighty fine doing it). ""Magic Mike"" which was written by Tatums producing partner Reid Carolin is a lightweight that like its protagonists is only out for a good time. It tells a simple story -- some might say classic some might say hackneyed -- of a young man finding himself an older mentor reconsidering his life and discovering love and the enduring power of a buff-and-bronzed hottie gyrating in a spangled codpiece. No moralizing no deeper meanings -- just a good old-fashioned cinematic hen party like ""Mamma Mia"" with six-pack abs and the flash of a well-dimpled tush. The screaming dollar-bill-waving women who comprise Mikes devoted audience are never treated with contempt or scorn in ""Magic Mike"" (unless you count a brief scene of a dancer throwing his back out after lifting a voluptuous audience member) nor are the sleazy but essentially decent dudes he bros-out with. And Mike himself -- as portrayed in a wonderfully playful spontaneous performance by Tatum -- proves a not just watchable but worthy central character whether hes pursuing Adams sister Brooke (newcomer Cody Horn in a refreshingly sober naturalistic turn) or dropping trou on stage. Not surprisingly those sequences are the standout scenes in ""Magic Mike"" when Tatums dancing prowess comes to dazzling light in a series of athletic sinuous moves ranging from pop-and-locks slides and back flips to the more sexually evocative gestures of classic burlesque. Evincing the same brand of self-deprecating comedy that made his ""21 Jump Street"" performance such a good-natured surprise Tatum gently mocks his onetime career and honors it by giving it everything hes got -- which is quite a bit it turns out. Tatums own understanding of discipline focus and entertainment value infuses an otherwise campy enterprise with improbable nobility. ""Magic Mike"" may not work hard for the money but its star does and his diligence pays off in ways that even the most generous G-string cant contain.Contains pervasive sexual content brief graphic nudity profanity and some drug use.

""Magic Mike"" is so much better than it needs to be that its sick. Yes its the Channing Tatum male stripper movie; yes it shamelessly exploits defenseless hunks for their rippling pecs and tearaway pants. No fifty percent of America give or take will not be buying tickets. This is ladies night at the multiplex.So fine guys what you dont watch you cant miss. Director Steven Soderbergh is working very near the top of his game here and if ""Magic Mike"" tells an old old story about a young man his talent his rise and his fall -- see everything from ""Saturday Night Fever"" to ""Boogie Nights"" -- he brings the confidence of a born filmmaker and a cast thats sharper than their characters and ready to play.Best of all the movie stands just far enough outside the world it depicts to provide irony and distance and a saving sense of humor while still bringing the cheese steak. Mike Lane (Tatum) has the body and the moves and hes fully aware hes in the business of selling safe sex to women dying for a little fantasy. But he likes to call himself an entrepreneur and ""Magic Mike"" is almost as much about business as pleasure.The key word is almost. On one of his contracting day jobs in Tampa Mike befriends a rangy lost boy Adam (Alex Pettyfer) and brings him along to his evening gig at a club called Dallass. The owner Dallas is a cracker whos past his stripping prime but doesnt care; hes played with no fat on his body or his performance by Matthew McConaughey who can finally say hes found a role that matches his peculiar and dissolute talents. Dallas breathes fire for the hell of it; his come-on is a randy ""All right all right all right all right.""Narratively ""Magic Mike"" goes nowhere new and in fact Soderbergh seems to take a retro pleasure in the storys very old-hatness. So why is the movie such ridiculous fun? The visuals are part of it Acting once again as his own cameraman the director paints his Florida the color of a dirty luscious lemon and he picks up on details others might miss The plastic wrap on Mikes car dashboard the hurricane tape on the windows. Everything here is temporary provisional which is a miracle when youre 19 and a looming catastrophe when youre 30.Mostly though the movie lives for its strip numbers which are hilarious exercises in full frontal camp. The soundtrack propels us forward with devilish song choices; the films energy is loose infectious undeniable. Soderbergh has made a party of a movie with intimations of disaster; there are drugs and thugs toward the end and a good-time girl (Riley Keough) with a creepy pet piglet. But when ""Magic Mike"" turns moralistic it fails to convince. Its much better at the night before than the morning after.Tatum in case you hadnt noticed has become a star. The story lifts off from the actors own early ah work experiences and the shock as always is that such a big lummox can move so fast and so well. He sells us on his characters innate decency his small-business ambitions and he lets us see that Mikes smarter than all the other dancers but that hes still not smart enough.Most of all Tatum appears to get the great carnal joke about men taking their clothes off for an audience of paying women -- that the tables are turned that the watchers become the watched that the objectifiers turn into sex objects. Everyone gets to play no one gets hurt and the husbands and boyfriends (who are barely to be seen in this movie) never even have to know. McConaugheys Dallas rides above it all like a demented down-home Puck. All right all right all right all right.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com (c) Copyright 2012 Globe Newspaper Company.

The story was inspired by Tatums real-life experience as a stripper in his late teens and the film follows 30-year-old Mike as he takes 19-year-old Adam (Alex Pettyfer) an unemployed college dropout under his sculpted wing.Almost as impressive as Tatums moves are his comic flair and breezy grace. He proved his comic talents earlier this year in 21 Jump Street and shows them off winningly here.When the movie is focused on Tatum McConaughey and the hilarious outrageous choreography of the male strippers (their costumes seem inspired by the Village People) its particularly engaging. But when the focus drifts to more peripheral characters or follows more serious plot threads its a grind. About the movieMagic Mike out of fourStars Channing Tatum Matthew McConaughey Alex Pettyfer Cody Horn Olivia Munn Director Steven SoderberghDistributor Warner Bros. Rating R for pervasive sexual content brief graphic nudity language and some drug use Running time 1 hour 50 minutes Opens Friday nationwideDirector Steven Soderbergh is nothing if not versatile but when he tries to inject Adam into drug-hazed scenes that would have played better in his 2000 film Traffic its hard to care about the bland characters choices.Mike calls himself an entrepreneur but he makes his money as the hottest headliner in an all-male dance revue. His conduit to the American Dream is a gaudy G-string. Underneath that sexy exterior however is a sensitive guy dismissed as just a pretty face by women like Joanna (Olivia Munn). But within seconds of Mike meeting Adams big sister Brooke (Cody Horn) we see theyre destined to be together. Soderbergh is known for his startlingly original camera angles and deft editing (see 1998s Out of Sight). Here his signature moves occur at unusual times such as on a car ride with a drugged-out Adam in the backseat.Though movies featuring exotic dancers are more than plentiful there hasnt been a mainstream male stripper flick since 1997s The Full Monty. More dirty dancing and less dull skirting around the main characters however would have made Magic Mike more freshly enchanting. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

Pictures Magic Mike review Stripped down to brilliant 1 / 6 Back to Gallery Magic Mike Comedy-drama. Starring Channing Tatum Alex Pettyfer and Matthew McConaughey. Directed by Steven Soderbergh. (R. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Steven Soderbergh is doing something that some of our finest old-time directors used to do the Howard Hawkses the William Wellmans. Hes not trying to make a few great movies. Hes trying to make a whole lot of good movies in lots of genres and to make them better than anybody else. And the result is that Soderbergh is going to end up directing more great movies by accident than his colleagues will by trying. Which brings us to ""Magic Mike"" a mix of comedy and drama that takes place in the world of male stripping. If it falls short of greatness its not by much - and it could end up growing with the years. At the very least it is exceptional and one of the best and most original pictures to come along in 2012. It stars red-hot Channing Tatum in the title role and if ever there was a movie sure to solidify an up-and-coming stars place in the publics affections its this one. Tatum has steadiness and strength a reflective quality that makes you think he cares and the hint of a smile that lets you believe he doesnt think hes all that much not really. He has that double thing going on that male stars need Women will say ""Ooh him"" and men will think ""That is a real guy."" He also has enough moves - backflips gyrations and fluid pelvic undulations - that he could become the worlds premier stripper tomorrow if he wanted to take a pay cut. The story revolves around a friendship between the 30ish Mike and a 19-year-old kid Adam (Alex Pettyfer) that he meets on a construction job. The kid needs money so Mike brings him to the strip club to do menial work. But lucky Adam happens to have a six-pack and next thing you know hes in the rotation and living the life - with all the awakened rapacious hunger and common sense that we associate with teenage boys. ""Magic Mike"" brings the viewer into that world just as it brings Adam and shows a life of nonstop fun and laughs. Its a safe bet that after seeing this movie young men all over America will start doubling down on the sit-ups. Every night theres a performance followed by a party followed by at least one woman coming home with our young hero. In this life a king-size bed is a practical necessity. Yet gradually the movie communicates something else too not from the standpoint of judgment but in an open-eyed sort of way and thats a feeling for this worlds limits. Matthew McConaughey plays Dallas who owns and emcees the Tampa strip club and most of his scenes are rather funny as when he teaches Adam the art and psychological nuance of the pelvic thrust. Yet between the laughs McConaughey along with Soderbergh and screenwriter Reid Carolin is showing you a guy you would not want to be or to be around for too long. Theres the whiff just a whiff of the dead end. Along the way we get the story of a friendship between two men the young one who wants to eat the world and the slightly older one who ate it already - and who now wonders if hes been devouring himself. Carolins screenplay is witty and in harmony with Soderberghs editing his abrupt way of ending scenes which gets a laugh in several places. Likewise the naturalness of Carolins dialogue is well matched by the documentary-like style that Soderbergh adopts here. It feels so loose so easy. Soderbergh just looks over their shoulders and they tell their secrets.   Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

"Magic Mike has the moves but not the heart Review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesReview Magic Mike has the moves but not the heartMagic Mike stars a charismatic Channing Tatum but director Steven Soderbergh pays more mind to the dances than to characters relationships.June 28 2012|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic I didnt always yearn to be a film critic. I had other aspirations other dreams. Being a male stripper however was never one of them and nothing I saw in""Magic Mike""made me want to change my mind.Yes the new film from director Steven Soderbergh makes it look like there are some pluses to that line of work at least initially. Women are plentiful and adoring the parties non-stop and there is the matter of money a all those ones fives and tens stuffed into your pants. Theres even were told the occasional twenty but Magic Mike played by Channing Tatum cautions darkly ""You dont want to know what I have to do for twenties.""But sad to say serious relationships are hard to sustain in this line of work because the discerning good women of this world skeptical of your moral fiber wont give you the time of day. And thats got to hurt.PHOTOS If Magic Mike is the Citizen Kane of stripper movies ...Likewise though ""Magic Mike"" begins nicely with the jazzy pizazz of performance its surface transgressive behavior soon sinks under the weight of an undernourished emotional component thats as old-fashioned moralistic as they come.If youve already heard anything about ""Magic Mike"" you may be surprised to know that this film has any emotional component at all. Its the buzz of what goes on behind the scenes as hot guys take it all off before a wild and sweaty all-female crowd that has gotten almost all the attention.Clearly it was this element that captivated Soderbergh who jumped at doing the project when he heard that Tatum engaged briefly in this very activity before acting lured him to Hollywood.In the clunky script written by Reid Carolin who heads the actors production company Tatum stars as Mike a Tampa terpsichorean first met waking up after a night of presumed erotic activity with two women only one of whom (Olivia Munns adventurous Joanna) he actually knows the name of.But Mike a.k.a. the sole owner and proprietor of Mikes Custom Detailing as well as the designer of dubious custom furniture has to hustle to make ends meet which means promptly taking off for his day job of putting roofs on other peoples mansions.PHOTOS ""Magic Mike"" premiereThere he meets Adam (Alex Pettyfer) a 19-year-old college dropout currently couch surfing on his sisters sofa a bear of so little brain that even Mike takes pity on him. He dubs Adam ""The Kid"" and introduces him to the world of Club Xquisite and its Male Dance Review managed by entrepreneurial former dancer Dallas (an amusing Matthew McConaughey) whose only regret in life is the years he wasted in high school.Though the film would have you believe that Mike and his team of dancers a an amorphous group of thinly drawn types with names like Tarzan (Kevin Nash) and Big Dick Richie (Joe Manganiello) a barely practice and use a kitchen as a dressing room the elaborately costumed and choreographed dances they execute would do credit to the Rockettes.Working with the actors and a top team of Hollywood professionals a production designer Howard Cummings costume designer Christopher Peterson music supervisor Frankie Pine and choreographer Alison Faulk (whos collaborated with Britney Spears and Madonna) a Soderbergh relishes the films hot dog moments and has made sure that the onstage part of ""Magic Mike"" is characterized by energy and flash.Granted the pantomime bumping and grinding the dancers do with selected women does not look like fun but who am I to judge?Life however cannot be lived entirely on stage and once the characters have to take off their thongs and return to their real lives the film goes nowhere that is either interesting involving or surprising.The first non-surprise is that though the Kid is initially hired as an assistant a last-minute stripper crisis means that he is thrust on stage and yes he goes out there a youngster and comes back a potential star.But though the Kid quickly develops a taste for hearty partying he never loses that ""Im in Over My Head"" stamp on his forehead a designation that forces Mike to repeatedly step in and try to save him.Those rescue missions put Mike in increasing touch with the Kids older sister Brooke (newcomer Cody Horn) a serious sort who reads books in hard covers and holds down a 9-to-5 job. Brooke is also the only woman in Tampa who starts out immune to Mikes charms which this being the kind of movie it is immediately makes her the only woman he is seriously interested in.Reluctant romance is of course a Hollywood staple but ""Magic Mikes"" version of it is dead on arrival. Tatum displays charisma and style but he and Horn have less chemistry than Abe Lincoln and the vampires he hunts.If filmmaker Soderbergh had paid as much attention to relationship dynamics as he does to dance number mechanics this film would have gotten closer to living up to the magic in its name.kenneth.turanlatimes.com---------------------------------Magic MikeMPAA rating R for pervasive sexual content brief graphic nudity language and some drug useRunning time 1 hour 50 minutesPlaying In general release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESChanning Tatum confirms Magic Mike the Musical is...July 24 2013Magic Mike Soderbergh and Tatum put critics under their...June 29 2012For Magic Mike crew being sexy is a lot of workJune 23 2012Magic Mike hunks Channing Tatum Joe Manganiello trade...June 1 2012Magic Mike trailer Its all a striptease teaser can...April 18 2012MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesBusinessFilmNot_live_webCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-magic-mike-20120629,0,5035959.story",200,magicmike14,magicmike,latimes

By Dana Stevens From left Adam Rodriguez as Tito Kevin Nashas Tarzan Channing Tatum as Mike and Matt Bomer as Ken in Magic Mike Photograph by Claudette Barius/Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. After youve watched Magic Mike come back and listen to our Spoiler Special discussion with Dana Stevens and Dan Kois. You can also download the podcast here Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Steven Soderbergh Channing Tatum and male strippers The convergence of these three elements alone is reason enough to see Magic Mike Soderberghs larky summer comedy--or is it a drama?--about a charismatic professional hunk and the naive hanger-on he takes under his wing. Soderberghs often cool dispassionate directorial eye seemed difficult to imagine in the act of ogling a leather codpiece. Happily though the particular Soderbergh avatar who stepped up to helm this project wasnt the chilly formalist who made Contagion or The Girlfriend Experience but the laid-back stylin dude who brought us Out of Sight and Oceans 11. So sunny is the filmmakers mood here that its nearly an hour and a half into the movie that the first real untoward event occurs. Magic Mike spends the majority of its running time virtually conflict-free The point of its existence is to watch attractive young people flaunting their bodies to one another and to us to vicariously enjoy the lazy pleasure of flirtation and the heat of the Tampa sun. Advertisement Less than a minute into the movie your ticket has already paid for itself naked Channing Tatum-wise. As the Mike of the title he gets up one morning and heads to the bathroom leaving not one but two women behind in his bed. The one whos awake Joanna (Olivia Munn) teases him for not being able to remember the sleeping girls name but as it turns out neither can she. It soon becomes clear that Joanna and Mike have a tacit agreement to serve as each others commitment-phobic booty calls while they pursue separate lives. By day Mike works on-and-off in construction runs a car-detailing service and dreams of starting his own line of custom furniture. But he pays the bills at night by--a-boom-chicka-wocka-chicka--taking it all off at a club called Xquisite. As imagined by Soderbergh this unique venue owned and run by the flamboyant impresario Dallas (Matthew McConaughey) is somewhere between a soft-core peep show and an off-Broadway cabaret revue. The audience mainly sorority girls and young women at bachelorette parties squeals with delight as the crew of buff Xquisite dancers busts out their highly conceptual strip routines. A fully choreographed ""Its Raining Men"" with the men twirling umbrellas and wearing raincoats over micro-briefs was a big crowd-pleaser early on as was Mikes virtuosic solo breakdance (either Soderbergh was employing some really subtle special effects or Channing Tatum can backflip off a stage yo). And Id kill to see more of an absurd medical-themed number that seemed to involve two near-naked medics spinning an audience volunteer around on a gurney while a third administered erotic CPR. Eventually Magic Mike seems to remember that as a narrative feature film it should have a story of some kind which is how we come to focus on the struggles of Adam (Alex Pettyfer) a 19-year-old college dropout whos landed on the couch of his more responsible sister Brooke (the enigmatically poker-faced beauty Cody Horn). Adam is without any particular direction or talent (or as played by the handsome but lackluster Pettyfer charm). But after meeting him on a construction job Mike takes a shine to ""the Kid"" as he calls him and gets him hired as a backstage gofer at the club. On the Kids first night there a backstage accident (Tarzan passed out before his big number OK?) requires him to take the stage and shyly remove his clothes to the strains of ""Like a Virgin."" The ladies go wild and the Kid is brought on as a regular in the show receiving personalized bump-and-grind tutelage from Dallas himself. They grow up so fast Before long Adam is coming offstage each night with a thong full of cash money and blowing it on living the high life with Mike (in whom he shyly confides the morning after their first all-night rager ""I think we should be best friends."") Mike flirts with the Kids disapproving big sister; the Kid flirts with a pink-haired empty-eyed party girl who carries her pet pig everywhere; and Dallas flirts with the heady possibility of making enough money to move the whole Xquisite operation to beachside property in Miami. A late series of plot developments about the Kids involvement in a failed drug deal feels both rushed and unconvincing. But Magic Mike is at its best when it follows its easygoing titular hero through an average day (which might involve wearing coat and tie while being rejected for a bank loan or showing up at a friends door at 7 a.m. dressed as Marilyn Monroe). Half wish-fulfillment fantasy half after-school special Magic Mike is in many ways an unserious movie--but like many of Soderberghs slicker entertainments its not without its moments of substance. The screenplay by Reid Carolin is in part based on Tatums real-life experiences as a teenage stripper and though the Xquisite may be a more utopian workplace than your average strip club theres a thrum of economic urgency in the background of this movie. The need to hustle to keep one step ahead of the system is always paramount; every character is playing the odds in one way or another. The scene in which Mike unsuccessfully tries to talk a female bank employee into giving him that loan is as close as the movie gets to social commentary In this economy Soderbergh makes plain a gift for the gab and a mouthwatering set of pecs will only get a man so far. One strange feature of Magic Mike is the almost complete absence of overt homosexual desire from its story. This is a movie that invites us repeatedly to delight in the sight of sculpted near-naked male bodies--we never do see any full-frontal nudity but there are bare buns and flopping packages everywhere. Yet though its not out of the question that McConaugheys character might be gay--Dallas sexual desire appears to be entirely directed toward himself--there are no male patrons in sight at the Xquisite. Nor do any of the regular dance crew--Ken (Matt Bomer) Tarzan (Kevin Nash) or Big Dick Richie (Joe Manganiello)--seem to have or be in the market for a boyfriend. Dont get me wrong Im fully in support of Magic Mikes pro-straight-dudes-gyrating-in-chaps platform and like my viewing companion John Swansburg I hope hetero men will flock to this movie and come out with a new appreciation for both the beauty of their own sex and the early 80s work of the Weather Girls. But insofar as Magic Mike is a (mostly) lighthearted summer fantasy about sexual and economic liberation through male stripping it would be nice to see gay guys get in on some of the fun.

(Video) Magic Mike Pre-Sales Are Taking Off on Fandango Ann Curry Endures Crotch-Thrusts From Magic Mike Star on Today (Video) The biggest surprise about this Steven Soderbergh movie about hot guys who take off their clothes? Its dull Steven Soderberghs ""Magic Mike"" brings to mind the old joke about non-dairy creamer -- we know what it isnt but what is it? If youre expecting a sexy and voyeuristic peek into the world of muscular dancers taking off their clothes for roomfuls of rowdy women (i.e. the movie that the ads and trailers are selling) youll be disappointed at how lackluster and ultimately repetitive the stripping sequences are. If Soderbergh wanted to use male stripping merely as a catchy hook on which to hang an interesting story or a captivating character study well the script by first-timer Reid Carolin provides a slight familiar story alongside characters who arent all that interesting. And while ""Magic Mike"" tries to use the business of sexual fantasy to make a point about the depressed state of the new millennial economy Soderbergh already covered that ground to much better effect in ""The Girlfriend Experience."" Perhaps the most surprising thing about ""Magic Mike"" is the way that it hews intentionally or unintentionally to the plot of a previous male-stripper epic the 1981 TV movie ""For Ladies Only"" which featured Gregory Harrison as a would-be Serious Actor who instead becomes Manhattans hottest male exotic dancer while his best pal (played by a pre-""Beastmaster"" Marc Singer) sinks into drug addiction. Channing Tatum (on whose life experience this film is loosely based) stars as Mike who thinks of himself as an entrepreneur -- his gigs include roofing furniture design and car detailing -- but who makes a living shaking his groove thing every night for Tampas most pent-up females. On a construction job he meets young college dropout Adam (Alex Pettyfer) and figures ""The Kid"" (as Alex is known for the rest of the movie) would make a better stripper than roofer. The Kid stumbles through an impromptu baptism by fire at the strip club (as Harrisons character did) before getting hooked on pills (as Singers character did) while Mike strains to become anything that is Not a Stripper (as Harrisons character did). Replace the questionable early-80s fashions with zeitgeist-y concerns about the recession and youve pretty much got the same movie. Also read Magic Mike Red Band Trailer Channing Tatum Bares Everything But His Genitals Soderbergh doesnt shoot the stripping sequences as though he were directing a musical; it would be tempting to say that hes going for a documentarians approach but an actual recent doc about exotic dancing -- Frederick Wisemans ""Crazy Horse"" -- offers up numbers that are much more elaborate and significantly sexier. The naughty bits of ""Magic Mike"" are for the most part dull and not in a way that feels like a directorial choice. Outside of the club Soderbergh mutes the Florida sunshine to a grimy overcast-ness part of an overall strategy to give the movie a more 1970s feel. (Said strategy includes everything from organically unstructured Altman-esque scenes complete with overlapping background dialogue to the use of the vintage Saul Bass-designed Warner Bros. ""W"" logo that was retired 20 or so years ago.) But even if we dont talk about them much there were bad movies in the 70s too. Both Tatum and Matthew McConaughey (as the strip clubs figuratively and literally oily manager) continue their streak of movies in which they prove that theyre actors and not just himbos and theyre matched by Cody Horn as Adams concerned sister. Horn brings a young-Diane-Lane vibe to the proceedings and her scenes with Tatum bring ""Magic Mike"" its only moments of feeling like a genuinely compelling story about recognizable human beings. Also read Ted vs. Magic Mike in Battle of the Sexes at the Cineplexes Pettyfer doesnt have it in him to inject any life into the non-character hes playing and Matt Bomer and Joe Manganiello have so little dialogue that they barely register at all. (Manganiello plays a dancer known as ""Big Dick Rich"" and that one detail is about as much as we ever learn about him.) Riddled with show-biz cliches stick-figure studs and re-heated ideas ""Magic Mike"" thrusts its junk in your face despite having a very empty G-string. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

More about Magic Mike >> Strippers exotic dancers determined to put on a show to titillate arouse. Just a bunch of guys doing their job. In Magic Mike an odd and entertaining mix of backstage melodrama indie verite and Showgirls kitsch the usual gender stereotypes are upturned. Its the rare movie (or TV cop show) these days that doesnt have a strip club scene with women in G-strings snaking around poles angling toward the guys waving 20 bills. Channing Tatum who has the title role in Magic Mike and Steven Soderbergh the director have flipped the equation. Here its the men as lust objects serving up the erotic fantasies (firemen? construction workers? GIs? cops?) and the bachelorettes shopgirls and housewives who are downing the booze whooping and hollering eager to touch the merchandise and shower them with dollars. But male strippers are people too with hopes and dreams troubles and woe. And so Tatum - who did this gig for real when he was a younger lad - plays Mike one of the star attractions of Tampas Club Xquisite as a hardworking Joe who does construction and builds custom furniture when hes not break dancing in the buff to a room full of screaming females. Sure he likes to party - and have three-ways with his gal pal Joanna (Olivia Munn) and whoever they pick up that night - but hes a serious dude. And when he starts to mentor young Adam (Alex Pettyfer) also known as the Kid he promises the Kids sister Brooke (Cody Horn) that hell keep him out of trouble. But with all the Ecstasy and alcohol girls and money floating around thats a hard promise to keep. And Mike doesnt want to let Brooke down. He likes her. In fact hes starting to think about her a whole bunch even if she doesnt think much of what he does for a living. ""Am I Magic Mike right now talking to you?"" he says trying to make the case that hes more than mere beefcake. ""Im not my lifestyle."" And its lines like that - Im not my lifestyle - that help make Magic Mike such a weirdly guilty pleasure. Soderbergh who has been on a breakneck run - Contagion and Haywire last year The Bitter Pill and Behind the Candelabra next - favors a lo-fi improv-y aesthetic that seems at odds with the exaggerated flash and extravagance of the subject at hand. And so hell have Matthew McConaughey who plays Dallas Xquisites owner and impresario strut onto the stage in his leather chaps teasin and grinnin like some X-rated carnival barker. And then hell cut to Tatum and Horn in the faded light of her nondescript apartment talking about what they like to eat for breakfast. For the record Tatum Pettyfer and the guys playing Tarzan Tito and Big Dick Richie throw themselves into the dance numbers with ardor and agility - and throw off their clothes. Hear the roar.

At the Magic Mike screening I attended there werent just wives but also husbands applauding his eye-popping stage routines. I may or may not have been one of them. Rarely do you see an actor harness such physical energy on the screen much less dance at this level of intensity while converting raw muscle mass into raging sex appeal. But Tatum is the real McCoy oozing charisma here as a one-man firestorm who plays along with the strip club script (embodying firemen construction workers soldiers rappers) before erupting into a blur of breakdancing groin thrusts and flying clothing. For a short time earlier in his life Tatum was in fact a stripper and his confidence is palpable. There are sequences here so electrifying and infectious that its easy to see why Warner Bros. (a division of Time Warner Inc.) devised a marketing campaign built entirely around a greased-up Tatum and Matthew McConaughey regaling hordes of screaming women. But in reality Magic Mike is far less interested in those spotlighted abs than in the lies we tell ourselves in and around that stage. As hes proven throughout his career director Steven Soderbergh is intrigued by the shifting moral limits that influence our decisions and its outside the confines of this Florida club where Magic Mike makes its most provocative statements. Mike (Tatum) and Adam (Alex Pettyfer) are two strippers at opposite ends of their career. Mike is the established pro the 30-year-old headliner of a Tampa all-male revue who knows exactly how to work the crowd and far more importantly rustle up new business from the mainstream bar next door. Adam is the outsider who is introduced to Mike on a construction job -- an aimless 19-year-old couch surfer who is sick of being broke living with his sister and overcoming a botched football career. (READ Richard Corlisss review of 21 Jump Street) Its Mike who brings Adam into the revue giving the broke guy a chance to earn a few quick bucks running props (and penis pumps) backstage. But when one of the pros collapses that first evening leaving a hole in the nights program wrangler/owner Dallas (McConaughey) gives the insecure young hunk the chance to be a star. In stark contrast to Mikes whirling theatrics Adam plods down the stage with little finesse. But his chest is toned and the girls are quick with the cash and three months down the line Adam the Stripper is thanking Mike for bringing all this fast money and these easy women into his world. If Adam lies to himself about his job by boasting that at least hes finally paying rent and getting laid Mikes inner rationalization is that hes less an erotic dancer than an ""entrepreneur"" engaged in raising capital. He meticulously straightens every last dollar bill that he earns on the stage and stockpiles his savings in hopes of launching a handmade furniture company (appropriately enough we never really see him craft any furniture). When hes not dancing Mike is also helping Dallas to manage the clubs books or telling his boss about his dream of having equity in the business when the small-time strip joint makes its long-anticipated move to the prime time of Miami Beach. Mike is as bold a dreamer as he is a dancer and Soderbergh (who also worked with Tatum on Haywire) ensures that we spend enough time amid his swagger before we witness him come crashing back to Earth. Magics extended reality check begins when hes turned down for a small business loan. Despite his sizable wad of cash and his charming demeanor his credit score doesnt mesh with his flushed loan officers regulations. Mikes introspection escalates when he meets Adams sister Brooke (newcomer Cody Horn). She finds Mike charming and exciting but is also worried about the lifestyle that hes leading Adam into -- and utterly incapable of looking beyond his profession. (READ Richard Corlisss review of Haywire another Soderbergh/Tatum collaboration) That professional isolation is reflected in just about every aspect of Mikes life. In between colorful exuberant and deliberately cheesy strip-show sequences Soderbergh gradually plunges the viewer deeper into Mikes closed bubble of reality. His evenings are all business on the stage followed by wild parties with his anonymous customers. His days are spent shaking off hangovers or partying with his co-workers. We see how his job comes to define his life and shield him from alternative points of view. In Brooke though Mike finds someone who questions his routines his business partnerships and his general lack of entrepreneurial progress. Tatum marshals a breakthrough performance in Magic Mike. That he commands the screen as seducer and performer is hardly a surprise given his turns in Step Up and The Vow but more notable is his quiet charm and insecurity as he works to impress Brooke. The films shortfall is its lack of story arc or emotional transformation. Divided into three monthly chapters Magic Mike makes abrupt hard turns that tend to bypass pivotal emotional revelations. Clarity comes a bit too quickly to Mike though Tatum does the best with what hes given to preserve a character study from derailing into emotional turmoil. Where the film thrives though is in its dissection of a sexually charged atmosphere. Indeed the most subversive facet of Soderberghs approach to the subject matter is the way he slowly inoculates us to the ""magic"" of Club Xquisite. At first electrifying Mikes stage performances become increasingly predictable and then almost routine as we begin to see beyond the seductive performance to the repetitive almost mechanical movements underneath. Its not that the paying customers are displeased -- they clearly relish the escape and seem happy with their purchase -- but just that we can see more easily through the facade. The same goes for Brooke Dallas and eventually Mike himself. And though Tatums moves will put butts in the seats its his blues that brings a surprisingly dramatic twist to all that sweaty flesh.

Pictures From Magic Mike - Siblings Siblings Credit Warner Bros. Pictures From Magic Mike - I Got Him I Got Him Credit Warner Bros. Pictures The distance between the movie sold by a trailer and the one you end up seeing is often as wide as that between the appetizing burger in the fast-food ad and the heat-lamped puck of sadness delivered to your tray. But in the case of Steven Soderberghs latest that expectation mismatch works in reverse The advertising might make this look like a flimsy excuse to put a bunch of hunky guys onscreen in equally flimsy thongs but Magic Mike turns out to be more complicated than its slick vapid rom-com trailers would indicate. That might worry anyone who was sold on the idea of a big dumb parade of sharply sculpted eye candy -- a summer blockbuster without the usual spandex obscuring all the carefully toned abs and pecs. Never fear If you came for a feast of flesh youll get more than your moneys worth -- within the first few minutes even. But Soderbergh is a filmmaker who keeps one foot firmly planted on each side of the art-vs.-entertainment divide. He can turn on a dime from the perfect pop moviemaking of Oceans 11 to the self-conscious experimentation of Bubble and it appears that this latter portion of his career -- hes said hell be retiring soon -- is devoted to blending those two inclinations. So much as with Haywire earlier this year Magic Mike finds the director pulling at the threads of genre conventions to see whats revealed in the unraveling. Channing Tatum plays the titular Mike a charismatic entrepreneurial 30-year-old with a roofing business a car-detailing business and dreams of a custom-furniture business. He also spends his weekend nights performing in an all-male dance revue that caters to sorority girls bachelorette parties and bored housewives run by an owner (Matthew McConaughey channeling a subtle sometimes frightening darkness) so dripping with sleaze that if he was still dancing himself he probably wouldnt even need to oil his body down. Mike takes Adam -- a shy young screw-up he meets at a construction job -- under his wing shaping him into a dancer in his own image much to the consternation of Adams sister Brooke (Cody Horn) who inevitably becomes the one girl Mike cant immediately charm into bed. Shes a symbol for the something more Mike wants out of life the something thats always frustratingly out of reach. Thats the generic setup but Soderbergh keeps things fresh by concentrating on who these characters are rather than simply using the plot as an excuse for the dance sequences. That means a lot of slowly developing conversations during which the director utilizes the sort of long takes that dont allow bad actors to hide behind editing. i Matthew McConaughey brings a subtle frightening darkness to the role of a strip-club owner with a sizable sleazy streak. Claudette Barius/Warner Bros. Pictures hide caption toggle caption Claudette Barius/Warner Bros. Pictures Matthew McConaughey brings a subtle frightening darkness to the role of a strip-club owner with a sizable sleazy streak. Claudette Barius/Warner Bros. Pictures Thats significant because his lead is an actor who for much of the last six years has been one of the most reliably lifeless screen presences in Hollywood. Yet here Tatum reveals a comfort in front of the camera like nothing hes ever displayed before. We knew he could handle the physical demands -- he began his career as a stripper himself and became a star thanks to his footwork in 2006s Step Up. But as a man desperate to realize dreams of something more fulfilling than the increasingly empty existence the club provides Tatum sells each and every disappointment that comes down the line. Less convincing is Horn as Brooke whose monotone detachment plays like a failed attempt at an uptight emotional remove; it comes off more like unrehearsed disinterest. That doesnt hurt the film too much though since that love story is less interesting to Soderbergh than the black hole of drugs and dashed dreams that is the club. The money and the networking opportunities of the place look to Mike like his ticket to the next step in his life with the partying and the women a nice side benefit. But its actually nothing but a mirage on quicksand and the films portrait of self-delusion and gradual awakening makes for compelling viewing even if its eventually somewhat undercut by a pop-romance ending that seems undeservedly tidy. Soderbergh may bow to the entertainer side of his split filmmaking personality in that moment -- but then again if you cant send your audience home with a smile in a film that features a group of half-naked dudes using umbrellas as blatant phallic symbols during a performance of ""Its Raining Men"" youre probably doing something wrong.

By Colin Covert Star Tribune July 2 2012 -- 353pm Video (4824)  Colin Covert finds Soderberghs Magic Mike is more than just a cheesy male stripper movie. Shari L. Gross Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Channing Tatums juicy male stripper romp ""Magic Mike"" boasts more six-packs than a tailgate party sensationally enjoyable choreography and a dash of romance. Its a lighthearted girls night out movie and a funhouse mirror turned on American sexual attitudes and economic anxieties. Steven Soderbergh the Oscar-winning director of ""Traffic"" and ""Sex Lies and Videotape"" gives the audience its moneys worth -- a front-row view of some architecturally outstanding male bodies --while slipping in subversive ideas almost subliminally. The film is a semi-autobiographical sketch of the period when Abercrombie amp; Fitch model-turned-actor Tatum performed in a ladies exotic dance club. He carries the film with an aw-shucks clowning flair that works beautifully on camera. Tatum plays Mike a Tampa hunk who works in construction auto detailing and as a featured dancer at Xquisite. Hes second banana to the clubs owner/emcee Dallas (Matthew McConaughey in full-on self-parody mode) who is preparing to relocate his operation to the big time in Miami. Mike doesnt want to be grinding onstage at 40 like fellow performers Ken (Matt Bomer ""White Collar"") who performs as Barbies dream beau; Tarzan (weathered WWE star Kevin Nash); Latin loverboy Tito (Adam Rodriguez ""CSI Miami"") and Big Dick Richie (""True Blood"" werewolf Joe Manganiello). Mikes goal is designing custom furniture but its hard to land a bank loan when your income is wadded dollar bills. He meets 19-year-old airhead Adam (Alex Pettyfer) at the construction site taking ""the kid"" under his wing and initiating him into the fraternity of tear-away pants. The Kids a possible new attraction for the club where Mike holds a small equity stake. More important he comes with an Attractive Sister Who Provides Useful Romantic Complications (Cody Horn). Uncertain whether shes more intrigued or appalled she chides Mike for bringing Adam into this thicket of temptation while slowly warming to the big guy. ""My lifestyle isnt me"" Mike protests and you can tell he realizes how lame that sounds as soon as he declares it. The film is another canny move by Tatum who admirably avoids pigeonhole roles. Hes most convincing in this sort of self-effacing good guy role. He flirts wearing a spaniel expression and makes Mike a scalawag rather than a lech. His body language onstage is as confident as a bullfighter but in a scene where he has to humble himself before a kind firm female bank officer hes visibly diminished in his timid business suit. His scenes with Horn who is fetchingly skeptical of him snap with comedic energy. Claudette Barius Warner Bros. Channing Tatum stars in ""Magic Mike."" The surface topic of ""Magic Mike"" is lust and love and the gaping chasm between physical and emotional intimacy. At heart however its all about the Benjamins. The story is a well-thought-out essay on our topsy-turvy economically stressed era. Used to be women were chattel the female body was a barter object the male gaze was master of all it ogled. Now its mens jobs that are downsized first and its employed women who are calling the shots. Olivia Munn shines as a pushy professional who keeps Mike on tap for booty calls. When Mike flirts with a couple of fine ladies in a bar his goal isnt to get them into his apartment its to get them into Xquisite and to get their cash into his thong. Tatums character is well into young adulthood with middle age on the horizon; he wont be a sex grenade forever. Seeing him monkey-dance around the stage in pursuit of crumpled dollar bills is sad on so many levels. Dallas who has been in the game longer has learned to fake caring for his customers and dancers but his smile always has money on its mind. Offstage the dancers talk about self-help books like ""Rich Dad Poor Dad"" and Dallas says if he had a kid he would home-school him on nonstop telecasts of ""Mad Money."" When this Texas cowboy striver suits up as Uncle Sam for a strip-off its like a raunchy editorial cartoon come to life. Alison Faulks eyeglass-steaming dance routines cast the guys as Team USA fantasy figures gunslingers cops and soldiers. Soderbergh uses emphatic red and blue lighting to underscore the star-spangled all-American subtext. Hes aiming to heal the rift between audience-pleasing pop movies and cinematic movies and here he succeeds beyond expectations.

Area theaters. If youre coming for the show youll certainly get your moneys worth from ""Magic Mike."" Director Steven Soderbergh makes sure his movie about male strippers is packed with pecs. But theres plenty more beneath its well-oiled surface. For starters its a pleasure to see Matthew McConaughey -- a gifted actor who cant hide his boredom in trivial work -- finally settle into the role for which he was born. McConaughey plays Dallas the dangerously charismatic owner of an all-male ""revue"" in Tampa. His main attraction is Magic Mike (Channing Tatum) a local legend who packs Club Xquisite with sorority girls and bachelorettes nightly. At first Mike seems to love his work. But as he watches new recruit Adam (Alex Pettyfer) deal with the jobs instability and defends the club to Adams skeptical sister (a blank Cody Horn) he wonders if the benefits are worth the cost. A lesser filmmaker would have relied on the central gimmick to carry the whole picture. After all how many movies about female strippers has it taken to arrive at a single one about men? But Soderbergh works in layers allowing us to choose our fantasy. Most obviously weve got a story about guys living the dream days free nights filled with cash women and any drug desired. On the flip side its a tale of stunted aspiration of the physical and emotional costs of the daily grind -- especially when grinding daily is how you choose to pay the bills. The carefully choreographed show scenes make clear that Soderbergh is interested in the work itself. And he deftly captures the vibe of a club that runs on screaming women and preening boy toys. Even so he never underestimates the price of objectification -- or the shadier aspects of Gulf Coast life. Both McConaughey and Tatum (whose pre-fame stripper stint inspired the story) intuitively understand this duality. Their aging characters still get high off the attention the excitement the sexual thrill. But we can see the worry in their eyes They know theyre gonna crash. And the prettier they are the uglier it will be. Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Before Channing Tatum took the vow as a movie star he had a short career as a stripper. Out of that fun fact director Steven Soderbergh has fashioned Magic Mike. Its not a biopic. The script by Reid Carolin simply uses a male strip club in Tampa Florida as a backdrop to show the blood sweat and desperation that go into making stripping pay. Tatum plays Mike who strips to foster his dream job in furniture designing business. He and his fellow bare-assed dudes including Joe Manganiello Matt Bomer and Kevin Nash show the ropes to The Kid (Alex Pettyfer) a drifter who finds a home in the junk shop. The first part of the film is raunchy fun with Matthew McConaughey stealing scenes as Dallas the Clubs den daddy. Watching the dudes work on their dance moves in front of ravaneous women exerts a real fascination though the script never truly examines the motives of strippers or the audiences. Instead Soderbergh dawdles over Mikes flirtation with The Kids sister (Cody Horn). Worse the film develops a virtuous squint that starts tsk-tsking everything that was first shown as a fleshy amusement park. It turns out that the sex drugs and rock amp; roll lifestyle is really bad for these guys especially The Kid. Magic Mike slowly degenerates into a simplistic cautionary fable. I didnt see that coming from a sharp observer like Soderbergh.

Pictures photo Magic Mike Magic Mike is a role-reversal revelation BY JOE WILLIAMS gt; Post-Dispatch Film Critic gt; joewilliamspost-dispatch.com gt; 314-340-8344 Jun 29 2012 (...) Handout Channing Tatum in ""Magic Mike."" Warner Bros. Pictures photo In the spectrum of sexually liberated films ""Magic Mike"" is wedged between ""Shampoo"" and ""Showgirls.""If the unclothed characters were corn-fed females instead of beefy males this might be a moldy morality tale but in the hands of adroit director Steven Soderbergh and rising star Channing Tatum ""Magic Mike"" feels as fresh as a summer squash.The script is loosely based on Tatums stint as a stripper yet he doesnt play the role of the nude newbie. Thats boyish British actor Alex Pettyfer as the Kid a recent college dropout who meets Mike (Channing Tatum) on a Tampa roofing crew. Mike is an entrepreneur who designs industrial-grade coffee tables and runs an auto-detailing business but his main source of income is from dancing for bachelorettes at Club Xquisite. He is second in command to owner/emcee Dallas (Matthew McConaughey) who agrees to hire the shy Kid as a novelty substitute for an overdosed Adonis.Soderbergh has a firm grasp on the socio-economic milieu particularly the easy-money mentality of Dallas who allows his deejay to peddle pills and hopes to move the club to major-market Miami. And while the screenplay shortchanges the horny clientele Soderbergh compensates with hot hunks of role reversal for the movie audience whose phallic fantasies come to life during the in-your-face dance routines. (According to the credits the supporting cast includes TV stars Matthew Bomer and Joe Mangianello but they effectively function as sex-bots.)Where the story stumbles is in the moralizing subplots. Not-so-shockingly the Kid succumbs to having all his wishes come true while Mike romances the Kids protective sister (Cody Horn) and wonders whether theres more to life than sex drugs and roofing. Tatum (""21 Jump Street"") is growing as an actor but in portraying a player who forsakes the game hes no Warren Beatty. Its guilty of some sleight-of-hand hokum but in pulling the rug from under the norm ""Magic Mike"" turns a trick.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Theres no denying that Magic Mike is a film about the world of male stripping. Filled with naked muscular flesh and screaming fans clamoring for more of it its planted firmly in the world of men who enact over-the-top fantasies of masculinity to make a living one dollar bill at a time. But its as much about just that making a living one dollar bill at a time. The characters in Magic Mike seem to enjoy stripping well enough but its no ones first career choice. When the job goes well they can more than make ends meet but making it go well requires constant effort. Its work in other words a means to an end where the end keeps receding a little further in the distance--in part thanks to some on-the-job distractions unique to the profession. Directed by Steven Soderbergh from a screenplay by Reid Carolin Magic Mike was partly inspired by the youthful experiences of star Channing Tatum whose early career included time as a stripper in Tampa after a failed stint attending college on a football scholarship. But if Tatum has a surrogate in the film it isnt the eponymous Magic Mike (Tatum) but the one played by Alex Pettyfer an adrift 19-year-old who sleeps on his sisters couch and drifts from one under-the-table manual-labor job to the next with seemingly no ambition. At one of those jobs he meets Tatum a supervisor at a roofing job who seems to have more going for him than most people he meets. Bumming around Tampas nightlife-rich Ybor City neighborhood Pettyfer bumps into Tatum and asks for some help getting into a club. Tatum agrees on the condition that Pettyfer help him out with an unspecified task. Before the guy hes soon to rename ""The Kid"" can balk Tatum asks ""Do you want to be inside or outside?"" That question resonates throughout the film though theres really only one answer Outside is for losers. But some places are harder to get inside than others. Pettyfer quickly finds it isnt too difficult to get into Xquisite the club where Mike works as the lead dancer in an all-male revue. After all hes got the looks the other dancers seem to think hes okay and when one of Tatums co-stars overindulges and cant take to the stage Pettyfer assumes the spotlight for himself and does just fine for a first-timer. Soon hes dancing most nights and sometimes partying with Tatum until dawn none of which meets with the approval of his sister Cody Horn. Tatum assures her hell take care of her little brother and delivers that assurance with the charm thats let him get as far in life as he has though hes probably wondering whether its a promise he can keep. In many respects Tatum is just as lost. He has a relationship of sorts with a sexually adventurous grad student (Olivia Munn) that seems largely defined by their success in putting together three-ways. Stripping and construction are just two arms of an entrepreneurial empire that includes auto detailing and his main love custom furniture but the cash hes piled up in the home safe of his suspiciously upscale-looking house never piles high enough to convince his bank to back him. So its back to the stage for one more group number set to ""Its Raining Men"" and one more spotlight number featuring some remarkably athletic dancing (obviously performed by Tatum without the help of a double). Like The Girlfriend Experience Magic Mike doubles as an of-the-moment film about life in a down economy so much so that it would play like a bait-and-switch if it didnt just as thoroughly deliver as a movie about stripping. As with Traffic Contagion Oceans 11 and other films Soderbergh has a keen interest in how industries--drug trafficking disease control casinos--work and narrowing this films focus to the clubs tiny economy. Matthew McConaughey plays Xquisites owner Dallas. Hes largely put his stripping days behind him but he presides over the club like a beefcake version of the MC from Cabaret setting just the right tone for the club by mixing undeniable sexiness with cheeseball charm. There is no better actor for such a part than McConaughey who inhabits the role while occasionally using it to send up his own public image. (Bongos make an appearance as does the phrase ""All right all right all right"" and when McConaughey wears a shirt it usually isnt a whole shirt.) Offstage McConaughey puts on a show similar to the one he and his revue perform onstage He offers his dancers enough to keep them coming back for more along with the tease that if they play their cards right he may let them go all the way by offering a financial stake in a big new club in Miami. Soderbergh is so good at portraying the business of stripping--and the business of filming the dance sequences--that some of the human elements get a little lost. Magic Mike begins refreshingly free of melodrama. In spite of its prurient offerings and casual backstage drug use Xquisite doesnt seem terribly seedy and Pettyfer is levelheaded enough to resist temptation. Then as if following the cues of every other rise-and-fall film vice arrives in the form of a temptress (Elvis granddaughter Riley Keough toting a potbellied pig) and a handful of pills. After subverting expectations in the films first half Soderbergh spends the second half living up to them as both Pettyfer and Tatum lose their way. And it doesnt help that Tatums path back involves an underdeveloped relationship with Horn. Yet as usual Soderberghs way of filming often trumps what hes filming. Few filmmakers know how to play to the strengths of modern digital cameras as well as Soderbergh who served as his own DP under his usual nom de camera ""Peter Andrews."" Magic Mike looks great and Soderberghs offhand approach to composition cuts through some of the cliches. Late in the film as Horn and Pettyfer talk about his downward spiral he lies flat in the backseat of her car. Soderbergh gets the shot by turning the camera on its side getting all the disorientation he needs through the simplest means offered by a confined space and a moving vehicle. He has able support in his cast too. McConaughey steals scenes but Pettyfer quietly underplays his characters self-destruction--imploding in ways that others might not notice if they werent looking or werent inclined to look--and Tatum ably proves he can carry a movie. Combining babyfaced sincerity with outsized sex appeal he makes it easy to see how Magic Mike could succeed as a stripper while showing the limitations of those charms. He plays Mike as a character starting to realize that a good portion of his life is a dream and hell have to wake up if he wants to start living in the real world. The film eventually takes to making that point with all the subtlety of a bucket of ice water. Its effective though overly direct in those moments but its even better when capturing the appeal of an existence buoyed by screams and floating currency. It shows that those living that life are subject to the same laws of economic gravity as anyone else who has to work for a living.

"Magic Mike movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Magic Mike Its a living for Steven Soderberghs troupe of male strippers  1/2 Chicago Tribune movie critic Michael Phillips picks 10 movies you should look forward to this summer. Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Its crazy to oversell ""Magic Mike""or fluff it up into something its makers never intended. It is not a major motion picture. It is not searing melodrama though in story outline terms -- the least interesting terms by which to engage with director Steven Soderberghs loose funky and blithely engaging workplace comedy -- it resembles ""Showgirls"" with showboys though without the hysteria or the punitive humiliation.So what is it then? Inspired by star and producer Channing Tatums own experience as a male stripper ""Magic Mike"" is ""42nd Street""""On the Waterfront"" the aforementioned ""Showgirls"" and a hundred other movies neatly tucked into one little thong. This nimble diversion makes up for a lot of higher-minded or lower-aiming Hollywood junk of late. The characters dont treat one another like punch lines or idiots. There are no real villains in the piece. Purest corn ""Magic Mike"" nonetheless has a human pulse and a sense of humor to go along with its willingness to entertain.Tatum first worked with the frenetically prolific Soderbergh on the eccentric and (metaphorically) stripped-down""Haywire""which went nowhere and back with the public. Id be surprised if ""Magic Mike"" met the same fate. When the projects right as it was with Soderberghs ""Oceans 11"" remake (and with diminishing returns the sequels) the director has a knack for revitalizing the oldest cliches in the book while setting them at an aesthetic remove. Soderberghs also terrific at letting his actors play up to the best of their abilities whatever their abilities. This is a polite way of saying Tatum as the construction worker by day who works constructively in a different line of work by night has never been better. Even if hes not much of an actor -- when things get serious Tatum appears to be giving birth painfully to the simplest of lines of dialogue -- hes increasingly comfortable and likable on screen.Set in Tampa Fla. cast in a perma-glow of mustard-yellow light in Soderberghs own digital cinematography ""Magic Mike"" is about a guy who has a lot but wants more and a younger guy who doesnt yet know where hes going. Mike is employed as a roofer and has a notion (minus a bank loan) to start a business for his handmade furniture. In short order Reid Carolins screenplay introduces a character named Adam (Alex Pettyfer) aka""The Kid"" a newbie on Mikes latest construction job site.In no time Mike is introducing The Kid to the wonderful world of the Club Xquisite where Mike and cohorts bump it grind it and thong it for the ladies and for the financial well-being of their employer/wrangler an ex-stripper named Dallas. This Lone Star satyr is played by Matthew McConaughey cutting loose in precisely the opposite fashion from the way Tom Cruise is cutting loose in""Rock of Ages."" In other words McConaughey looks as if hes having a blast. Hes a devilish movie star and Tatum can learn a lot from the way he commands a scene clothes or no.One of the pleasures of ""Magic Mike"" is its egalitarian spirit and dedication to the ensemble. The budding romance between Mike and The Kids big sister played by Cody Horn who has no visible performance nerves of any sort provides a hook on which to hang everything else. As Mike wrestles with his business ambitions and strives to prove to The Kids protective sister that hes more than just a slab of meat The Kid is led into temptations. Luckily Soderbergh handles these developments lightly. My favorite scene is the one oddly most like Soderberghs ""Che"" a day trip out to a sandbar for a picnic which becomes an occasion for the audience to eavesdrop on one conversation then another in free-form essayistic style. Nothing much happens to advance the plot but like some of the jungle training sequences in ""Che"" parts of a whole emerge naturally a few connections are made and the film moves on. Mainstream audiences may wish for more -- more thump in the drama noisier narrative developments to compete with the generous procession of club routines involving firemen firemens hoses and the like. Others I hope will take ""Magic Mike"" the way it is as a group portrait of a semiexotic species Strippus americanus. ""Women. Money. And a good time."" Thats what Mike offers The Kid. The key line in the script though is McConaugheys insinuating ""all right all right all right all RIGHT"" come-on to the Club Xquisite customers promising much and then in its earnestly low-rent yet satisfying way delivering. The movie does the same.mjphillipstribune.comMagic Mike -- 3 1/2 starsMPAA rating R (for pervasive sexual content brief graphic nudity language and some drug use)Running time 150Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Magic Mike Channing Tatum Entertainment Movies On the Waterfront (movie) Alex Pettyfer Haywire (movie) Magic Mike Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising73deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0626-magic-mike-20120628,0,6059167.column",200,magicmike25,magicmike,chicagotribune

Now as those who are familiar with Soderberghs work over the last 23 years and 30 or so films will attest praising him for warmth and romance is a little like proclaiming the nicest day of the year in Antarctica. Clear back to his era-defining indie hit ""Sex Lies and Videotape"" in 1989 this is a director obsessed with surfaces and reflections with voyeurism and narcissism with the way that human sexuality and the human body once understood as realms of private experience have become commodities.""Magic Mike"" which was reportedly inspired by the real-life teen stripping career of good-natured star Channing Tatum (who also co-produced the movie) fits almost too perfectly into the Soderbergh catalogue. Its close to being a gender-reversed more audience-friendly remake of ""The Girlfriend Experience"" his little-seen 2009 indie featuring porn star Sasha Grey as a high-end hooker. There are indeed plenty of strip-club dance numbers -- in which Tatum proves suspiciously adept at the cheesed-out pseudo-hip-hop choreography -- and Matthew McConaughey gives a scene-stealing award-worthy performance as the unctuous perm-wearing club owner and dance coach. (I know Im not alone in pronouncing that Im enjoying McConaughey much more the second time around.) But ""Magic Mike"" is a more abstract and self-consciously artistic view of the male-stripper subculture than the marketing campaign suggests and opening-weekend audiences eager for cheerful nastiness may find themselves baffled.Magic Mike is the all-conquering lady-killing stage persona of Tatums character a cheerful 30ish bon vivant who pays the bills as the lead attraction in the Cock-Rocking Kings of Tampa at least when hes not working construction jobs or trying to launch his dream business as a custom furniture craftsman. Mike is struggling to grow up a bit haplessly and Tatum captures that struggle with wonderful casualness He puts on spectacles and a suit during a failed effort to get a bank loan -- it appears the female bank officer has seen him wearing much less -- and holds out hope that his occasional three-ways with a slumming psychology student (Olivia Munn) might turn into a real relationship.McConaugheys oily but earnest Dallas who has offered Mike a piece of the action when and if the club relocates to a beachfront venue in Miami seems to represent Mikes possible future. His past on the other hand can be glimpsed in Adam aka ""The Kid"" (Alex Pettyfer) a washed-out college football prospect Mike recruits on a job site. In many ways the strongest element of ""Magic Mike"" is its offhand social portrait of the working-class strugglers and strivers and hard-partiers of the Gulf Coast with its crappy overbuilt real estate and its mortgaged-up visions of glitz and glamour. Not many American filmmakers would show that landscape honestly and fewer still would grasp that in that environment a strip club is less like a tawdry escape fantasy than an exaggerated version of reality.I think the key scene in ""Magic Mike"" both thematically and emotionally arrives when Adams sister Brooke (Cody Horn of TVs ""Rescue Me"") comes down to the club to find out what her feckless kid brother is up to. She stands in the back an apparently detached observer watching Mikes dance number and the ravening horde of women stuffing bills into his codpiece and for most of the scene the camera is on her not on them. (As is customary Soderbergh shot and edited the movie himself.) She watches but does not participate -- always a position of power in Soderberghs universe and in ours too -- and as she tells Mike a few scenes later during a tentative getting-to-know-you beachfront stroll ""I get it -- the way you were dancing the way the women were responding to you. I get it."" She gets what exactly? Well not to go all Zen on you but the kind of transcendence people yearn for in the atheist-capitalist visions of Steven Soderbergh isnt easy to put into words. You Might Also Like Even though the slow-burning romantic-comedy attraction between Mike and Brooke is only one of several plot lines in ""Magic Mike"" its the soul of the movie much more so than the dance scenes where Tatum slams his leather-clad groin into the face of some screaming extra playing a Navy wife gone wild. Each of them yearns for what seems authentic in the other As suspicious as she is of the Magic Mike persona Brooke is drawn to Mike as a vastly sexier and more genuine guy than her douchebag business-school boyfriend (a cameo role for screenwriter Reid Carolin) while Mike sees her as a pathway out of the alienated night-world of shared girls and shared drugs and endless parties. I have two things to say here about Cody Horn a relative unknown and the first of them is that shes very good playing Brooke as a wry independent no-bullshit type watching her beloved brother slip into a downward spiral. The second thing is that her dad Alan Horn is the former president of Warner Bros. which is distributing this film. (The senior Horn now works at Disney.) All of that leads to thing 2-A that Soderbergh is no dummy when it comes to the movie biz. If theres a problem in ""Magic Mike"" its that Soderbergh is drawn much more strongly to his bleak but beautiful Fellini-does-Tampa visions and to McConaughey and Pettyfers supporting characters and their world than to the off-center love story. Viewed as a fast-rising star until his career was derailed by allegations of bad behavior Pettyfer gives a tremendous vulnerable performance here as an innocent all too easily seduced by his new life. Adams puppy-dog affection for Mike is way too intense and the latter cant return it; hes been around the strip clubs of Tampa a bit too long to take that kind of friendship seriously. But Adam is still an idealist if a doomed one; at the other end of the spectrum lies McConaugheys Dallas who believes only in salesmanship and has lost any capacity to reflect on the fact that the things he wants arent worth having.Its no accident that Soderbergh has made both a two-part four-and-a-half-hour film about Che Guevara and an all-star trilogy of studio pictures about criminals who take down Las Vegas casinos. Hes the most devoted anti-capitalist in American cinema and whether hes taking on strippers or hookers or a worldwide flu epidemic or the international drug trade you have to see his work in that context. I think ""Magic Mike"" is a fascinating film one of his best in recent years. But it isnt quite as much randy escapist fun as it looks like on the surface. Thats because Soderbergh fears there is no escape for Magic Mike or any of us from the permanent Tampa strip club of the mind where we sit inhaling Buffalo wings and making it rain all over the latest naked offering.

Ted To Rome With Love Turn Me On Dammit Tyler Perrys Madeas Witness Protection Opening Tuesday The Amazing Spider-Man The Amazing Spider-Man 3-D In Steven Soderberghs naughty and hilarious ""Magic Mike"" it doesnt rain men -- it monsoons them.But theres more to ""Magic Mike"" than flash floods of toned and tanned torsos gyrating on the dance floor -- even though theres enough eye candy to trigger a sugar seizure. At its six-packed core is a well-crafted entertaining film made all the better by the electrifying presence of Channing Tatum and Matthew McConaughey.Certainly suspicions that this comedy-drama based on Tatums brief stint as a stripper would be another ""Showgirls"" get flung aside like a G-string early on.""Mike"" works best when its a fly-on-the-wall observer immersing us in the bizarre backstage antics of male strippers a seductive environment for men fixated on quick cash fast women and their pecs. ""Magic Mike"" is less successful when it gets stuck on a predictable story arc. But cmon this is a movie about male strippers -- there arent too many places for the story to logically end up. Soderbergh and screenwriter/producer Reid Carolin fortunately avoid taking the guys to insufferably dark and dreary places infusing even the films rougher edges with a sense of hope.Advertisement Their congenial but convincing attitude gives ""Mike"" a raunchy and outrageous soul. And oh how Oscar-winning director Soderbergh runs with the premise showing us strippers prepping primping dancing and donning and offing colorful costumes and undies. Pay attention to the backgrounds too; they provide further insight into the psyches of these quirky characters.McConaughey and Tatum are just as responsible as Soderbergh for making ""Mikes"" risque authenticity so compelling. McConaughey was born to play Dallas the vain but shrewd leather-pants-clad owner of Xquisite a strip club in Tampa. Fla. And what a relief it is to see him strut and use that Southern drawl to maximum manipulative effect not just in another lame romantic comedy.As good as McConaughy is Tatum is the real revelation. The actor whose breakthrough came in another dance film (the much-maligned ""Step Up"") here is fearless sexy and vulnerable handling comedy and drama with the same dexterity he shows in his incredible dance moves which were rousingly choreographed by Alison Faulk.Tatums been on a roll lately. He displayed deft timing in ""21 Jump Street"" (out on DVD this week) but this represents an even bigger breakthrough for an actor often criticized for being wooden and unremarkable. This should put a lid on his detractors.His ""Magic Mike"" is the clubs star attraction a guy who tears up the dance floor and hooks up with a bisexual hottie (Olivia Munn). Mike dreams of creating designer furniture but he has a heck of a time getting his plans off the ground. As he shows a newbie named Adam (Alex Pettyfer of ""I Am Number Four"") the ropes he starts to question his own identity and feel the fleeting nature of his youth. Those feelings hit harder when he meets Adams no-nonsense sister Brooke (Cody Horn giving a lovely low-key performance). She visits the club and realizes that Mike does have talent and sexual energy to spare. Speaking of sexual heat the supporting actors have plenty of it. ""True Bloods"" Joe Manganiello creates the most lasting impression benefiting from the films most out-there visual gag while Matt Bomer (""White Collar"") and Adam Rodriguez (""CSI Miami"") cut fine forms but dont have much screen time. Pettyfer the new recruit does a fleet-footed turn as the kid rising up the ranks. Wrestler Kevin Nash as Tarzan is most memorable for joshing with the kid.The fact that these characters come to crazy life without much of a moral compass at hand might disappoint those who desire a message movie. But for those who want to surrender to a good time let these well-drawn fellas and Soderberghs attention to detail entertain you.

At first they laugh embarrassed and blush. A strip club? They couldnt possibly -- its too ridiculous. But Mike flashes that aw-shucks grin of his and charms them into agreement. Magic Mike Fair to good Director Steven Soderbergh. Cast Channing Tatum Alex Pettyfer Matthew McConaughey Olivia Munn. Rating Rated R for pervasive sexual content brief graphic nudity language and some drug use. They get over themselves. They go. They have a great time. Watching ""Magic Mike"" you feel a lot like those two girls skeptical at first perhaps a little embarrassed but before you know it youre having a blast. Interview Channing Tatum Hotlist 10 strippers in movies Magic Mike"" twists gender stereotypes Channing Tatum stars as lead beefcake Mike a 30-year-old vet of the trade who takes pity on shiftless 19-year-old college dropout Adam (Alex Pettyfer). Mike takes the kid under his wing pulling him off his sisters couch and onto the catwalk. While Adam is loving his ascent Mike has aspirations for more. Hes good with his hands and has a passion for building custom furniture but bad credit and a bum economy keep him from getting the startup loan hes after. So Mike dances and socks away all those sweaty 1 bills with dreams of running a business of his own some day. But hes not hurting. Sure theres the general existential malaise that comes with all those pelvic thrusts and loveless hookups but there are no dark nights of the soul here. Even at Mikes lowest point when his dreams are hanging in the balance the guy just seems really bummed like he has been told the weekend trip to Disney World has been canceled. In fact none of the cast seems particularly aggrieved by his station. Even in the throes of his inevitable downward spiral Adam seems like hes having a good time. Meaningless sex drunken escapades recreational drug use and all the bad mornings that follow -- for a lot of people thats just part and parcel of being 19 minus the leather chaps. This isnt ""The Wrestler"" of male-stripper movies; its too breezy a flick for that kind of introspection. And with Steven Soderbergh directing that flimsiness matters less than it should. The Oscar-winning director has a gift for magicking undercooked characters and wafer-thin plot lines into sexy stylish romps (take this years earlier release ""Haywire"" for example). The dramatic void also leaves room for more fabulous dance sequences. Tatum was once a stripper himself and I mean it as a compliment to say that it shows. Its not just his dexterity with tear-away pants; he shows off some impressive and physically demanding dance moves all energetically filmed. He is at times mesmerizing on the dance floor -- for reasons other than his physique. Whatever his character and performance lack in terms of depth he compensates for in sheer charisma and likability. Also a total riot is Matthew McConaughey as Dallas strip-club owner master of ceremonies and sort-of villain (again the film doesnt quite muster the dramatic heft to support a serious villain). He steals every scene hes in with no small assist from skintight leather pants and finely honed pelvic muscles. The film does sag about the midsection and occasionally the whole project feels like an elaborate excuse for the crew to drink beer on a Florida beach. But like any good strip tease the film has a way of clouding your judgment. Though it may not have you throwing dollar bills at the screen it is likely to leave a smile on your face.

"Magic Mike | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; magic-mike ) Magic Mike (United States 2012) June 27 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli If your expectations for Magic Mike have been formed by the trailers and the TV ads you can be forgiven for anticipating a male version of Showgirls or Coyote Ugly. Keep in mind however that the director is Steven Soderbergh not Paul Verhoeven and neither Joe Eszterhas nor Jerry Bruckheimer has gotten his fingerprints on this. Magic Mike takes itself seriously - not so seriously that there isnt room for a little humor but this is not an excursion into cheesiness and gratuitous nudity. Soderbergh wants us to relate to the character of Mike (Channing Tatum) and in order for that to happen he develops an earnest narrative about a profession that is rife with campiness and clichA(c)s. Most stripper movies are about women and the lions share follow one of two formulas the good girl gone bad or the bad girl who wants to go good. The only other recent male stripper film I can remember is The Full Monty and it is so different from Magic Mike that comparisons are pointless. This movie neither lionizes nor demonizes male dancing. It attempts an evenhanded approach perhaps because lead actor Channing Tatums real-life experiences were used in developing the story. Magic Mike offers the three reasons why some young men are drawn to stripping women money and a good time. It also shows the downside which begins with drugs and ends with exhaustion and depression. Magic Mike is an allegory and its appeal lies in part in its message. You dont have to be a stripper to recognize what the filmmakers are saying. When it comes to choosing a career path most people elect the road to lucre rather than the route to satisfaction and fulfillment. At first the tangible benefits outweigh the soul-sucking negatives but over time it can be difficult to maintain any enthusiasm for a job that is held purely for its paycheck. Movies love to tell the story of a character who follows his dream. Magic Mike is a little different; its not so much about following the dream as it is about developing the courage to turn away from the money and look in another direction. That makes for a satisfying ending because it isnt so unbelievably optimistic as to be saccharine. Magic Mike tells of the rise of newcomer Adam (Alex Pettyfer) in the stripping business. A down-on-his-luck 19-year old he comes to Tampa to live with his sister Brooke (Cody Horn) and meets ""Magic"" Mike at a construction site. He tags along with the good-natured good-looking 30-year old to the club where he takes it all off for tips. The clubs owner Dallas (Matthew McConaughey) sees ""something"" in Adam and gives him a shot. After a briefly shaky beginning hes soon dazzling audiences. Meanwhile his ""big brother"" Mike is becoming disillusioned about the stagnation of his life especially when he realizes a relationship with Brooke is impossible as long as he continues on the stage. The choreography in Magic Mike is surprisingly complex and the dance routines are lively and engaging in their own right capturing as they do some of the energy that makes clubs like this popular. Soderbergh who wears the cinematographers cap in addition to sitting in the directors chair (as is always the case) brings as much verisimilitude to this location as any recent filmmaker has although there may be a little white-washing in order to get the R-rating. (Showgirls it should be remembered had an NC-17.) The nudity in the dances is surprisingly tame (butt shots only - no ""full Fassbender""). Overall Magic Mike is an equal opportunity offender when it comes to flesh. Naked men and women get about the same amount of screen time and Channing Tatums fans get an eyeful. This is the first film in some time to give Tatum an opportunity to display his dramatic capabilities and spending so much time in unimaginative mainstream fare has not blunted his talent. His rhythm and athleticism help to make him a very convincing Magic Mike. (Not surprising since theres an autobiographical aspect to the character.) Alex Pettyfer is not as convincing but hes more than balanced out by a hyperkinetic Matthew McConaughey who literally spits fire and throws himself into the part with a passion we have rarely seen from the often laid-back performer. I donat know if this the best performance McConaughey has given but its certainly his most memorable one. Cody Horn does some interesting things with her ""love interest"" part; I dont know whether its her style or the way Soderbergh directs her but she comes across as unpolished as if shes improvising every line. From time-to-time Soderbergh seems to forget that hes making a mainstream movie not an art house film. He uses some inventive shots (such as one thats taken from directly behind the rear windshield of a moving car) which is fine. He also employs a filter that makes the film look like it was shot through sunglasses which isnt as appealing. When it comes to two more important elements - emotion and energy - hes on the mark. Magic Mike gets the tone right. Its not too serious but it respects the characters and their situations. The storyline is derivative but theres enough to like about Magic Mike to make that more of a minor irritant than a major distraction.

Answer Several. Soderberghs Magic Mike Dangles Its Male Strippers With Skill But To What End? Answer Several. Eric Kohn Jun 27 2012 1133 am erickohn Share This Article Pin It Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Print Talk A masterful craftsman even when directing fluff Steven Soderbergh remains one of the more fascinating American filmmakers working today continually demonstrating an ability to handle wide-ranging projects without blatantly phoning it in. His last two years of releases have included a documentary on monologuist Spalding Gray (""And Everything Is Going Fine"") an apocalyptic ensemble drama (""Contagion"") and a martial arts extravaganza (""Haywire""). His latest ""Magic Mike"" has much in common with previous Soderbergh efforts in that it glides along at a terrifically entertaining pace. The opposite of camp ""Magic Mike"" is conventionally jolly despite appearances to the contrary. Only Soderbergh could turn a movie about male strippers into a universal crowdpleaser. ""Magic Mike"" has received plenty of pre-release hype for drawing its story from lead man Channing Tatums early career experiences as a stripper before his acting career took off but its basic ingredients are simple enough that it could have been conceived from scratch. Nineteen-year-old shyster Adam (Alex Pettyfer) struggles to figure out his professional calling while living out a drab existence with his sister Brooke (Cody Horn) a serious-minded nurses aide in sunny Tampa. Roaming the streets one night he encounters Mike (Tatum) whom he briefly met during a deadened construction gig. Thats when things get funky. Ever the entrepreneur Mike immediately notices Adams aptitude for drawing the opposite sex and quickly enlists the younger man at the boisterous Club Xquisite a hugely profitable all-male revue run by the Wonka-esque Dallas (Matthew McConaughey). Anchored by a series of hilariously over-the-top choreography replete with lavish stage design and a lot of undulating torsos ""Magic Mike"" nimbly settles into its snazzy coming-of-age story with an emphasis on breezy satisfaction While ostensibly focused on the hustling Mikes gradual recognition of a higher calling beyond the stage Soderbergh still relishes the candy-colored stage antics and the giddy rush that viewers of any sexual disposition can get from it. The movie eagerly has it both ways. With title cards indicating monthly shifts as the story unfolds over the course of a lively summer ""Magic Mike"" follows Adams downward spiral into the seedy party life that Mike slowly realizes he has outgrown. Soderberghs roaming camera has fun with the details (a backstage instance of penis inflation marks his cleverest use of mise-en-scene in some time as it simultaneously catches Adams gaping eyes in the background). But Soderbergh also sits still for pensive moments that routinely assert the serious narrative sustaining the good vibes particularly once Mike takes a romantic interest in Adams conservative-minded sister and must confront her measured disdain for his profession. As the only fully sane person in the movie Horn handles her role well enough but Tatum owns ""Magic Mike"" more than its director displaying heretofore unseen levels of charisma and attitude that provide the realistic counterpoint to McConaugheys cartoony showmanship. (If the movie only focused on him it would fly off the rails.) An aspiring designer with business smarts to spare Mike is the movies soul both onstage and off. Like nearly every Soderbergh movie since ""The Girlfriend Experience"" the script contains innumerable zeitgeist references mainly tagged to the struggling economy. Dialogue frequently centers on the imperative behind the gig The strippers job calls for ""25% dancing and 25% marketing"" in the words of one practitioner (the other 50% is left undefined but after all its a part-time gig). Several conversations revolve around get-rich-quick schemes of various other forms (a throwaway line name-drops Robert Koyosakis ""Rich Dad Poor Dad What the Rich Teach Their Kids About Money""). As a fancier upgrade for the club members in Miami looms ""Magic Mike"" heads toward an inevitable confrontation and climax. By the time Mike pleads ""Im not my lifestyle"" his exoneration has been evident for an hour. Most audiences expecting something closer to a masculine ""Showgirls"" might be surprised by the relatively serious tone ""Magic Mike"" crams together several derivative subplots that dangle (sorry) around energetic striptease sequences enacted with the ostentatiousness of an MGM musical. Its such a slick er package that one can easily overlook the lack of originality as things veer toward a series of cliched resolutions. Mikes flailing bids to win over Brookes heart work better than a half-baked drug-dealing subplot and the stage antics always steamroll the allure of everything else. However a lot of its shortcomings are only apparent in retrospect. Soderbergh hugs a familiar arc that makes its path visible long before it arrives at various twists but even when revealing its secrets ""Magic Mike"" casts a seriously entertaining spell. Criticwire grade B+ HOW WILL IT PLAY? Warner Bros. releases ""Magic Mike"" this Friday in the wake of mostly positive early reviews. It will likely perform decently as mainstream counterprogramming to the bigger popcorn fare and emerge as one of the summers sleeper hits.

"Magic Mike (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Magic Mike (R) This likeable comedy about male strippers starring Channing Tatum and directed by Steven Soderbergh is nothing but a good time. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle cogleMiamiHerald.com6/27/2012 Editor rating 3 If you can look past all the flesh and the thongs and the thrusting -- and I admit that is an almost impossible task and probably not one youd want to undertake anyway -- whats most distinctive about Steven Soderberghs Magic Mike is its sense of fun. This film about male strippers in Tampa inspired by actor Channing Tatums real-life experiences is as similar to Showgirls as stripping is to investment banking. Soderbergh and screenwriter Reid Carolin purposely pay only scant attention to the dirty side of the business (the drugs the fluffers the general seediness) in order to put forth an entirely original yet unsurprising idea Sometimes hot young guys take off their clothes on stage to reap the rewards of women money and the never-ending party. Magic Mike is about one such guy (Tatum) who appreciates all that stuff until a need to be taken seriously begins to outweigh his desire for easy cash and easier sex. Mike has a couple of day jobs but by night hes the star at Xquisite a club run and hosted by the enterprising Dallas (Matthew McConaughey whose hipbones deserve a sequel and should probably be pressed into immortality outside Graumans Chinese Theatre). Dallas wears a cowboy hat and does not seem to own many shirts and he acts as sort of a madam to his coterie of dancers. As far as hes concerned he has the best job in the world. Mike likes his job too. He has a healthy sense of humor about his night moves but hes got dreams too. He wants to build custom furniture and needs a bank loan to finance his long-range plans. He wants his elusive hook-up (Olivia Munn) to take him seriously too but she tends to look at him as if hes a particularly tender rare cut of steak one shes not much interested in talking to. And when he meets the younger directionless Adam (Alex Pettyfer) and ushers him into the fold he recognizes himself in the kids eager embrace of the lifestyle and isnt sure he likes what he sees. Adam also has a sister Brooke (Cody Horn) who also plays a big part in Mikes discontent. Essentially Magic Mike is a love story about a guy who has to grow up in order to get the girl and in that respect the movie is as safe and predictable as warm milk. Even Adams foray into drugs seems preordained. But Soderbergh never lets the drama run away with him. Even the most harrowing scene -- in which Mike and Adam dressed as cops work a sorority party that lapses into sudden violence -- isnt over the top; its quick confusing and realistic but it doesnt overshadow the movies light tone. Soderberghs attention to detail is well exquisite (witness the haphazard taping of the windows while a hurricane rages outside or the old-Florida jalousies on Brookes apartment) and the films humor is welcome and genuinely funny. The utter lack of heavy handedness is even more refreshing; Magic Mike is not a sociological study though it raises some interesting questions. The movie never comes right out and lectures us about how women go to strip clubs for different reasons from men -- for one thing they dont usually go alone; they tend to go in packs and scream with hilarity -- but the film suggests that idea effectively through its many stripping sequences. The trailers dont lie There is a lot of gyrating and simulated sex in Magic Mike and it looks like a hell of a lot of fun. Tatum who won the hearts of teenage girls with Step Up early in his career is a terrific dancer of course but hes also a solid likeable leading man This guy doesnt get enough credit for being as good as he is much like his co-star McConaughey whose recent roles in such movies as The Lincoln Lawyer and Bernie may indicate hes ready to abandon those dreadful romcoms for a while. His is a bold performance indeed. In one scene Dallas finally comes on stage to perform and McConaughey goes for broke rolling and writhing on the stage while women grab at him and throw cash. I wouldve handed over my credit card. The party cant go on forever Magic Mike tells us but while it lasts you may as well have a good time.

Tons of it. With the exception of one backstage shocker of a close-up you dont get the full monty--but maybe something even better. These choreographed dance numbers set to pumping remixes of ""Like a Virgin"" and unavoidably ""Its Raining Men"" are hilariously unsubtle. Never is an opportunity lost for an assless-chapped cowboy or a trench-crawling soldier to perform a crotch thrust; pants are removed with a magicians bold flourish. For these sequences alone Magic Mike connects on a screamingly funny level and not just for wayward bachelorettes. This being a Steven Soderbergh movie--he of the overstated ""retirement"" and reinvigorated craft (Contagion Haywire)--its also a beautiful piece of straightforward storytelling burnished with golden-hued cinematography and snappy cutting. Our hero Mike (Tatum who spawned the script from his own experiences) is the aging unsatisfied star of a nightly revue; lanky Adam (Alex Pettyfer) a jobless drifter is drafted into the squad thrilling to the female adoration and druggy edges of the scene. Theres an unusually fine sense of money anxiety from Mikes seedy 70s-style beach house in Tampa and construction day work to the routine of counting all those single-dollar bills and plunging them into ""equity""--a relocation to Miami is the dream. You know where this is all going. If Magic Mike doesnt quite attain the hedonistic stature of twin cautionary tales Boogie Nights and the campy Showgirls it cant be faulted for wanting to satisfy on a deeper level. Meanwhile didnt Soderbergh notice there was pathos enough in Matthew McConaugheys beefcake proprietor an ab-slapping spandexed Peter Pan? Between this role and his owlish DA in the subversively sly Bernie the actor has finally found a way to subvert his six-pack. Hes the magic here.

A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - When Channing Tatum stood up and revealed his bare ass to the camera a minute or two into Steven Soderberghs Magic Mike--which the actor conceived of and produced based on his own experience as a teenage dancer in an all-male exotic revue--the audience in my screening burst into a near-unanimous extended cheer. The gifts that made him a viable exotic dancer at age 18 have recently made the 32-year-old Tatum the male movie star of the moment. His appeal is based on working-class humility paired with otherworldly charisma an impossible body and the intelligence to make his use of it seem effortless. Now as then he never fails to give us what we paid to see. But what is he really revealing? The highly calculated Magic Mike is pure Hollywood self-mythology--a neo-Depression musical a wish-fulfillment fantasy for shitty times an origin-of-the-star story and a projection of that stars hoped-for future.Tatums Mike is the main attraction at Xquisite a Tampa pop-up strip club whose male dancers cater to an all-female clientele. Stripping is just one of wannabe furniture designer Mikes many jobs; on a roofing gig hes assigned to mentor scrappy newbie Adam (Alex Pettyfer) a 19-year-old rebel with neither cause nor clue who recently fucked up a football scholarship and sought refuge on the couch of his shit-together sister Brooke (intriguing newcomer Cody Horn). Mike his own career peaking at age 30 takes pity on the penniless Adam and brings him into the Xquisite fold. That seems to be the way things go around there; Mike himself was discovered on the street by Dallas (Matthew McConaughey) the clubs manager/main hustler who keeps talking about moving the show to Miami and dangling equity in front of his stars to keep them invested. As young Adam embraces this new world of easy cash and responsibility-free pussy Mike natch increasingly wonders if theres a different/better life available to him particularly because neither the fetching Brooke nor a bisexual academic played by Olivia Munn seem inclined to see a male stripper as anything but a fuck buddy.Related StoriesThe Men of Magic Mike XXL Look Great but Could Grow Up SomeFilm Details Magic Mike RatingR GenreComedy Running Time110 min. More Info Trailer The film suggests that the ladies prejudices are valid. ""Whos got the cock?"" Dallas asks Adam during his first dance lesson. ""You do. They dont."" The idea that these Kings of Tampa as members of the ragtag strip crew call themselves are giving the local housewives and sorority girls something they dont have and desperately need is stated several times in earnest dialogue but the actual transactions are shown as farce. (The movies cruelest joke is snuck into a wacky-times montage One of the dancers lifts an eager fat girl out of the crowd . . . and throws his back out.) That this film contains an ironic patriotic Fourth of July dance spectacular--with McConaughey as Uncle Sam leading a brigade of topless boys in fatigue pants in choreography belaboring the connection between automatic weapons and anatomical ones--is a given right? No less spectacular than this sleazy homage to Holiday Inn is the scene in which Tatum dons upstanding-citizen drag to apply for a small-business loan. Told his low credit rating brands him as a ""distressed"" client Mike fires back ""I read the news. I know the ones in distress are yall.""Occupy Chippendales? If only. The few moments wherein Magic Mike calls American institutions into question are undercut and overshadowed by the films dated insistence on the dream of legitimacy. Mike and friends move in a cash-only society hitting a glass ceiling any time they try to pass in the straight world. This milieu typical and unremarkable in so much current European cinema is given in Magic Mike a retrograde cautionary spin. In this under-the-table economy its a slippery slope from cruising Craigslist for day-labor gigs to showing ones ass for tips to big-money drug deals. Eventually someone drives away from the strip club in tears not because this is a plausible turn of events for the character but because thats what has to happen in a Hollywood movie about the sex industry.An extremely conventional backstage story Magic Mike is occasionally enlivened by Soderberghs aesthetic curveballs--the halo-shaped lens flares suggesting Adams halcyon view of the club; a long night of debauchery with major plot consequences rendered as an experimental study in color and shadow. But the denouement built around the hoariest of contrivances concerning the cyclical nature of stardom squarely casts its lot against self-commodification by extension damning the margins and endorsing the mainstream.That throws a wet blanket on the movies primary point of interest its self-reflexive portrait of three distinct points in the Hollywood himbo life cycle. As the still ogle-worthy old-timer McConaughey is Magic Mikes most wasted asset. Dallass onstage patter incorporates the actors most identifiable catchphrase--""all right all right all right""--which he injected into the popular imagination via Richard Linklaters Dazed and Confused. In that film McConaugheys Wooderson was the older guy who continued to hang around teenagers almost vampirically. Twenty years later McConaughey is essentially performing the same function here. But why? At the most fascinating moment in his career McConaughey gets stuck in an underwritten role that demands physical exposure but is (sorry) only skin-deep.

Pictures A beefcake bonanza with heart as well as muscle. TWITTER Inspired by Channing Tatums stint at 18 as a male stripper Steven Soderberghs comedy-drama also stars Alex Pettyfer Matthew McConaughey Cody Horn and a host of tasty It boys and girls. NEW YORK - In Magic Mike Channing Tatums pre-Hollywood experience as a male stripper has inspired not only one of his better roles but also arguably the raunchiest funniest and most enjoyably nonjudgmental American movie about selling sex since Boogie Nights its obvious if considerably darker precursor. Delivering what feels like a young directors work and not that of a guy nudging 50 Steven Soderbergh taps into the jazzy erotic energy that put him on the map more than 20 years ago with Sex Lies and Videotape. PHOTOS From Showgirls to Magic Mike Your Guide to 50 Years of Stripper-Themed Movies Following its closing-night premiere at the Los Angeles Film Festival the Warner release should rake in girl and gay dollars on the strength of its ample man candy alone. The script by first-time screenwriter Reid Carolin (Tatums producing partner) is stronger on dialogue and character than on narrative originality or emotional conflict. But as Soderbergh showed in his Oceans Eleven series the director has a terrific feel for depicting male camaraderie and the buddy elements should give Magic Mike inclusive appeal. It might also be the first mainstream movie to feature a casual demonstration of a pump-operated penis enlarger (keep an eye on the left-hand margins of the widescreen frame) which should at least provide a talking point at the multiplex. VIDEO Channing Tatums Magic Mike Offers a Red-Band Strip Tease A self-described entrepreneur whose small businesses include roof tiling car detailing and designing custom furniture from found objects Mike (Tatum) makes his serious cash as one of the ""cock-rocking kings of Tampa"" in a male dance revue at ladies nightspot Xquisite. The fringe benefits are apparent as Mike is slyly introduced naked and still groggy following a three-way with occasional hookup Joanna (Olivia Munn) and a girl whose name neither of them can remember. Mikes stripper guru is club owner Dallas a gonzo showman in leather vest and tear-away pants played by a hilariously self-parodying Matthew McConaughey. Sporting more six packs than a beer blast Dallas crew includes pretty boy Ken (Matt Bomer) whose ""Living Doll"" routine takes its cue from his name; Tarzan (Kevin Nash) a gnarled wild man in the Mickey Rourke mold; Latin stud Tito (Adam Rodriguez); and Big Dick Richie (Joe Manganiello) whose special talent requires no explanation though he does get a little help from the aforementioned pump. The undisputed star attraction however and big brother to the troupe is Magic Mike a role that allows Tatum to show off the slick dance moves hes kept hidden since Step Up. STORY Channing Tatum on Love Marriage and Magic Mike Choreographed by Alison Faulk the solo routines and the group numbers are a blast embracing every cheesy male stripper stereotype from soldiers sailors and cops to cowboys and firemen. These guys are like a heterosexual rethink of The Village People. Their routines include a fabulously hoary ""Its Raining Men"" number with trench coats and umbrellas and a boot-camp routine with McConaughey cranking up the crazy intensity as Uncle Sam. Soderbergh clearly gets a kick out of flipping the gender roles of sexual objectification. The club scenes cater to male fantasies of mass female adoration while the hordes of delirious drunken women stuffing singles into jockstraps represent a liberating switch from the usual depictions of sleazy men leering at pole dancers. The primary focus of Carolins story is the friendship between Mike and Adam (Alex Pettyfer) a directionless 19-year-old college football-scholarship dropout Mike meets on a roofing crew. Mike takes Adam under his wing shoving him onstage without warning to do his first strip appropriately to ""Like a Virgin."" Nervous but game Adam is dubbed The Kid and proves a natural at pleasing the ladies. Some of the funniest scenes include The Kid getting schooled in crotch-grinding moves by Dallas glistening in a crop top and short shorts; and Adams awkward nonexplanation when his sister Brooke (Cody Horn) discovers a box full of thongs and sex-fantasy costumes and finds him using her razor to shave his legs. The sibling rapport is sketched with warmth and humor as is the slow-burning attraction between Mike and Brooke. This is complicated by her protectiveness toward her loose-cannon younger brother and her skepticism about Mikes line of work. PHOTOS Magic Mike Channing Tatum Matthew McConaughey Suit Up for LAFF Premiere Tatum deftly shows that beneath all the hard partying and easy sex theres a longing for a real relationship in Mike as well as a hunger to explore his creativity by focusing on his furniture designs. Theres also an encroaching fear of ending up a self-deifying nut job like Dallas who plans to upgrade the act with a move to big-time Miami. Inevitably the movie takes a sobering turn. Adams lack of maturity impairs his judgment prompting him to overindulge in druggy sex (notably with Riley Keough as a stoned Kewpie doll with a pet piglet) and split an Ecstasy deal with the club DJ (Gabriel Iglesias). The entree of Adams character into stripping was inspired by Tatums experience at 18 though the out-of-control spiral reportedly is fictional. While this plotline echoes countless perils-of-success movies and easily could have become a male Showgirls Soderbergh shrewdly avoids letting it turn lurid or campy by underplaying the melodrama. Instead he observes droll but humanizing details like a quick shot of Mike patiently ironing out crumpled dollar bills retrieved from his underwear. The humor is refreshingly low-key and unforced such as having True Blood hunk Manganiello whos built like Iron Man be the delicate one of the troupe fretting over herpes or throwing his back out while giving a zaftig customer an airborne thrill. Some of the movies best moments are those in which Soderberghs nimble camera -- he shot the film under his usual cinematographer alias of Peter Andrews and edited as Mary Ann Bernard -- looks on while the guys chill backstage at Xquisite pumping biceps mending thongs or doing shots to get into performance mode. This dialogue often has a semi-improvised feel with Soderbergh eavesdropping on snatches of conversation in a style reminiscent of Robert Altman. VIDEO Channing Tatum Matthew McConaughey Salute Soderbergh at Magic Mike Premiere Theres a looseness and buoyancy to the filmmaking and to the naturalistic performances that keeps the story real and while many of the key castmembers have relatively little to do even the smallest roles add texture. Tatums balance of breezy confidence and nagging restlessness is just right while Pettyfer scores as the cocky new recruit dazzled by his sudden demi-celebrity. And as the movies grounded voice of caution Horn is enormously appealing. Betsy Brandt from Breaking Bad pops up in a nice bit as a bank officer processing Mikes loan application. Shot on Red Digital Camera the well-paced film goes for desaturated exteriors as if life outside the club unfolds in a sun-blasted permanent-hangover state. Music supervisor Frankie Pines playlist keeps the action humming and provides propulsive enhancement to this cheeky peek at a seductive world distilled by Mike to its essence of ""women money and a good time.""

Ladies are gonna love ""Magic Mike"" a lively male-stripper meller inspired by Channing Tatums late-teen pre-screen stint as an exotic dancer. More low-calorie fun than any Steven Soderbergh movie since ""Oceans Eleven"" this breezy offering ought to be subtitled ""How Steven Got His Groove Back"" as its typically high-minded director drops pretentions like tear-away pants. Meanwhile enlisting a squad of Hollywood hunks to strip down to their thongs alongside him Tatum (backed by producing partner Reid Carolin) drains the shame from a profession that gets no respect serving up a guiltless girls night out likely to rank among the summers word-of-mouth sensations. Nobody works harder than Mike a sort-of ""what if"" version of Tatum had he stayed in Tampa Fla. and stuck to stripping. A self-described entrepreneur Mike juggles three jobs -- dancing roofing and auto-detailing -- but dreams of starting a fourth business designing custom furniture. A few years ago he wouldve had no trouble getting a loan from the bank; these days credit is so tight the situation has practically forced him into stripping -- or so the film slyly implies with a terrific typically Soderberghian scene in which Mike tries to use his use his ladykiller charms plus a stack of 14000 in unwadded tips to convince a female loan officer to back his furniture proposal. Naturally such real-world details are the first thing to come off once Carolins script heats up. Frankly ""Magic Mike"" is no different from the gentleman who walks into the room dressed as a firefighter or cop and then delights the crowd by taking it all off. Tatum Soderbergh and team appreciate the real reason audiences showed up and the film provides just enough character and plot to validate the plentiful pecs and abundant buns that serve as its main attraction. While Mike is planning the next stage of his career he meets a clueless 19-year-old college dropout Adam (Alex Pettyfer) at the job site. The two guys bond a little which gives Mike the confidence he needs to drag the kid -- whose stage name will soon become ""the Kid"" -- into the world of the Xquisite all-male dance revue an elaborately choreographed G-string extravaganza overseen by self-made golden boy Dallas (Matthew McConaughey) and featuring a lineup that includes Matt Bomer (""White Collar"") Adam Rodriguez (""CSI Miami"") Joe Manganiello (""True Blood"") and WWE star Kevin Nash (who lumbers through routines the others enthusiastically ace). Like Christina Aguilera in ""Burlesque"" or Ryan Phillippe in ""54"" Pettyfer plays the films wide-eyed audience surrogate and even though ticketbuyers know what hes getting himself into theres a thrill in discovering this world through such a giddily naive perspective. Not since ""Step Up"" has Tatum had such a perfect showcase for his crazy dance moves but its no less entertaining watching Pettyfer play awkward as Adam is thrust onstage stumbling through his ""virgin"" performance. Everything about Soderberghs approach from the energy to the music (a mix of hot-today dance songs and such beefcake standards as ""Its Raining Men"") to the nonjudgmental tone seems to be onboard with stripping -- everything except Adams overprotective older sister Brooke (Cody Horn fully committing to the characters single disapproving-frown expression). Of all the dark complicated paths the story might have gone down ""Magic Mike"" contents itself as a relatively superficial different-classes love story in which Mike must prove himself responsible enough in Brookes eyes to overcome the pimplike way he recruited her brother ultimately giving Tatum a chance to bellow ""Im not my lifestyle"" like some kind of dime-store Stanley Kowalski. Thats not to say Tatum isnt actor enough to handle the assignment. In addition to the roles physical demands he has the added challenge of making it look effortless and Tatums gift comes in playing things casual inhabiting the character without having to spell out an elaborate backstory. Of the other strippers McConaughey steals the spotlight adding yet another strong characterization to a respect-building streak that began with ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" last year. Meanwhile a certain dopeyness serves Adam well and Pettyfer proves an excellent case of a director using his stars limited acting abilities to the films advantage. Soderbergh is in excellent form here putting aside the ambitious experimentation that threw a wet blanket on such ostensibly sexy projects as ""Full Frontal"" and ""The Girlfriend Experience"" while re-embracing the professional lighting and shooting techniques missing from ""Contagion"" and ""Haywire."" (Once again he serves as his own d.p. under the pseudonym Peter Andrews.) Tatum reportedly first approached Nicolas Winding Refn about making ""Magic Mike"" but here he has the benefit of not only Soderberghs commercial savvy but also the good-humored generosity and keen anthropological interest the helmer brings to every project. No moment captures that sensibility better than an oblique glimpse of backstage ""fluffing"" sure to rank among the years most amusing shots.
