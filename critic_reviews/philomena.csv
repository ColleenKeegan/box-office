Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Nov. 29 2013 1201AM EST Last updated Friday Nov. 29 2013 1201AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Stephen Frears Starring Steve Coogan and Judi Dench Classification PG Country USA Language English British director Stephen Frears (The Queen High Fidelity) hits his stride again after a few stumbles with the new film Philomena a drama that mixes some cozy truths and righteous indignation.Featuring an unlikely duo in acerbic comic Steve Coogan (The Trip 24 Hour Party People) as a jaded journalist and Dame Judi Dench as a kindly indomitable Irish woman the film is a calculated crowd-pleaser. But its a crowd-pleaser with political bite drawing parallels between the cruel treatment of young unwed mothers in 1950s Ireland and of gay AIDS patients in the United States a few decades later. Video Video Weekend movie pick Alexander Paynes Nebraska a serious Oscar contender The Associated Press Video Video Weekend movie pick Hunger Games Catching Fire surprisingly meaningful exciting Based on Martin Sixsmiths 2009 book The Lost Child of Philomena Lee the film follows the decades-long attempts of a retired nurse to find the toddler she was forced to give up for adoption in the Ireland. Coogan (who co-wrote the script) plays Martin a depressive journalist with Dench as Philomena a pious senior citizen who carries a supply of hard candy and biscuits wherever she goes.Though a determinedly cheery soul her life has been shadowed by the forced separation from her first-born child. As a teenager in rural Ireland she became pregnant after a fling with a boy she met at a fair. To hide her shame she was locked up in one of the notorious Magdalene laundries for fallen women run by nuns where she was put to work and allowed to visit her son only an hour each day. Three years later she watched through the window the day the nuns who ran the place sold her child to a wealthy American couple.Initially the films focus is on Martin an ex-BBC Moscow correspondent licking his wounds after being embarrassingly ousted from his flack job with Tony Blairs government over an unfortunate e-mail. Out of work and fresh ideas Martin is invited by a magazine editor to write a ""human interest piece"" which he considers beneath his dignity. But a chance encounter with Philomenas daughter a server at a cocktail party looks like an opportunity to milk some journalistic pathos.After a quick meeting Martin heads off with mom and daughter to County Tipperary to the Rosecrea convent where Philomena lived. The nuns who run the place are generous with their tea and fruit bread but tight with any useful information. Though they insist all records were destroyed in a fire they have conveniently preserved the contract where Philomena signed away any rights to her child.Having reached one dead end Martin begins combing through U.S. immigration and birth records. What makes the film work isnt really the detective story but the grace notes between the two actors. Denchs Philomena is a shy but voluble sort who beams while recounting her most recent romance novel in excruciating detail. Initially the laughs all seem to be at her expense but as the relationship grows the balance shifts. Although Martin rolls his eyes at her naivete and trite expressions Philomena proves more worldly about sexual matters than she seems and she undercuts his superciliousness and shallow cynicism with her directness.What at first seems formulaic comedy gains a deeper resonance as we see how they represent two responses to cruelty and injustice - first outrage and with time eventually forgiveness.

"Now Playing Bad Luck Tragedy and Travesty << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous The Road to Redemption  Next Over-rated (Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap) Allison Rosa/Long Strange Trip LLC Facebook Twitter Print Celebrities Now Playing Bad Luck Tragedy and Travesty The Coen brothers Dame Judi Dench and a mess starring Christian Bale and Casey Affleck. by Wesley Morris on December 6 2013 Inside Llewyn Davis opens in 1961 with the title character in a Greenwich Village bar with an acoustic guitar singing a folk song to a small rapt audience of young people. Glasses clank on the tables as he pleads ""So hang me oh hang me."" When hes done the applause and whistling are hearty. Because Llewyn Davis is a film by Joel and Ethan Coen it would be fair to expect that in due time Llewyn will be hung. These are two filmmakers whove put wood chippers and air compressors to lethal use for comedy and for dread. As my friend Mark said after he saw the movie These two think the Book of Job is funny. But the melancholy that suffuses this movie feels new. It isnt merely in the traditional folk hymns which T-Bone Burnett has produced and arranged. Its also in the smoky foggy blueish palette of Bruno Delbonnels cinematography and the brothers own restraint. For now theyve tabled the pleasure taken in bringing hell to earth. When we meet Llewyn played by Oscar Isaac the worst has already happened His musical partner Mike Timlin has thrown himself from a bridge. Now hes a solo act at an existential crossroads. Is he too pure for the coming folk explosion? Should he just rejoin the navy? Narratively the film is simply a series of deftly tailored episodes about what hes going to do with himself. Llewyn is another of the Coens luckless protagonists another Wile E. Coyote constantly beset by falling anvils. Its not just that his partner has killed himself. His mistress a singer named Jean (Carey Mulligan) tells him shes pregnant. Hes broke and homeless. And yet Llewyn differs from the Coens previous Jobs. God isnt punishing him. Llewyn is hurting himself. The sources of his woe are snobbery and narcissism. Nothing is good enough for him. He cant connect to anyone. Hed rather be a vagabond with principles than a man with a day job and a bed. Hes a lousy boyfriend brother son and friend. Exasperated harangues are all he brings out of women. His older sister (Jeanine Serralles) and the wife of a friend (Robin Bartlett) hit the roof. At one point Llewyn is invited to provide supporting vocals and guitar in a recording session with Jeans squeaky-clean boyfriend and folkmate Jim (Justin Timberlake). Its for a space-exploration ditty called ""Please Mr. Kennedy"" which they rehearse with a third fellow Al Cody (Adam Driver). Llewyn tries out some of the lyrics and harmonies and has to ask more or less who wrote this crap. Jim volunteers himself with Timberlake at his most hilarious virginal pitch. The minute we see these three bang out the song -- Driver doing the baritone interjections (""uh-oh"" ""outer [pause] space"") -- we know itll be a novelty hit. The first time I saw the film the theater erupted in applause when the song ended. Llewyn of course just wants the paycheck and briskly signs away his royalty rights but not his soul. The Coens included ""Please Mr. Kennedy"" because its catchy and clever and fun. But they also include it as an affront to Llewyns sense of authenticity. He seems to want to suffer -- not for his art but because of it. The brothers manage to capture the squareness of the early 1960s and the earnestness of the folk scene. ""Cool"" as it would come to be known was still being invented. A glimpse of it arrives in the form of Garrett Hedlund who still channeling On the Road plays a dude chain-smoking behind the wheel of the car that takes Llewyn and a rambling obese bluesman (John Goodman) from New York to Chicago for a gig. Some of the humor is cartoonish. Llewyn spends part of the movie chasing a cat that has escaped from his friends home. But whenever it appears as if the film will luxuriate in moronics the mood grays just enough. That runaway cat for instance becomes the closest connection he makes. Llewyn is such a source of insult to so many people that you cant imagine he was once socially productive. How could he have maintained a relationship with any woman let alone a fling with Jean? The answers are less in the writing and more in Isaacs presence. The film is a work of deceptive refrigeration. The character lacks the same sentiment and warmth as the men who created him. Its Isaac who takes some of the chill off. He doesnt cheat in playing Llewyns selfishness and abrasiveness. But the actor has a charisma that keeps him likable without pleading to be liked. But the movie isnt quite a satire. Nor is it entirely a road comedy. Its peculiarities amount to a plaintive hypothetical drama about what it might mean for Joel to exist without Ethan or the other way around. Isaac is a character actor whos been smartly deployed in a dozen other movies -- he was Mulligans ex-con baby daddy in Drive; the deviant orderly in Sucker Punch; and a Russian-born seducer in the underrated W.E. Madonna directed W.E. and she picked up on a strain of sexy showman in Isaac and let him run with it. Here he comes off like a full-blown movie star with a personality that functions almost independently of the mild contraption the Coens have built around him. For one thing the actor sings Llewyns songs himself so the sadness you hear in his voice is immediate. For another Isaac makes a shrewd creative decision Hes not playing most of the scenes in the emotional present. Hes physically there but appears to be trying to leave. When Llewyns partner dies he loses his other half. Thats where Isaac appears to be dwelling quietly on the loss bristling whenever anyone suggests he find another partner turning indignant when someone tries to finish an old Timlin-Davis tune. Only in song is Llewyn in the wounds of the here and now. The movie offers a punch line about the kind of folky superstardom Llewyn is missing out on. But it isnt quite a satire. Nor is it entirely a road comedy. Its peculiarities amount to a plaintive hypothetical drama about what it might mean for Joel to exist without Ethan or the other way around. We never meet Mike Timlin but get the sense he was indispensable to Llewyns sense of balance. Thats the source of the melancholy. Without Timlin Llewyn is unmoored a man with no answers blowing in the wind. Philomena contains a mystery thats solved in the first 40 minutes. What brings it to conclusion is not worth ruining. But the solution opens the film into something that will surprise even people familiar with the story of Philomena Lee. Lee was a retired Irish nurse living in England who as a young woman had her son taken from her by nuns who deemed her unfit for motherhood because she wasnt married. The boy was adopted by American parents. She spent 50 years with a broken heart and a nagging curiosity about what had happened to him. To the reluctant rescue came the journalist Martin Sixsmith freshly sacked from a job as a political adviser. He had plans to write a book about Russia but agreed to help Lee find her answers. The film directed by Stephen Frears begins as an odd-couple movie. Judi Dench plays Lee as a devout woman whos charming and easily charmed -- by the idea of Big Mommas House by the complimentary omelette that comes with her hotel stay and by the Mexican giant who cooked it. Steve Coogan makes Sixsmith a snob an atheist and a prig. He finds all that charm exasperating. But he becomes a committed sleuth both because he has a newspaper editor breathing down his neck and because as he and Philomena make their way to the United States he finds compelling her need to know if this long-lost son has ever thought of her or of Ireland. Coogan wrote the screenplay with Jeff Pope. Its smart and unsweetened. What interests them is not what happened to Lees son but why it happened and why the nuns decades later wouldnt help her find him. Eventually you realize theres a cover-up afoot that for years has depended on Philomena taking no for an answer. ""No"" simply makes Martin hungrier for a yes. Fondness and familiarity gradually shrink the chasms separating Martins temperament and class standing from Philomenas. Frears does nothing flashy or gratuitous. He can ply a film with theater (Dangerous Liaisons) noir (The Grifters) and tight tony TV-movie-ness (The Queen). But hes also good at natural staging. He often keeps Dench and Coogan in the same shot so you can see them reacting to each other. The sight of her nattering on about a romance novel as he barely disguises his disdain is very funny. Frears knows where all the human moments are. It also doesnt hurt that he has Dench to direct. Shes the least vain actress in the movies possibly ever. Here her hair is done as a kind of perm. The creases and wrinkles around her mouth suggest decades of contortion in worriment. She lacks actorly vanity. She serves only the needs of the scene even in juicy over-the-top garbage like Notes on a Scandal. As Philomena Dench has a climactic confrontation toward the end thats remarkable for how even she remains throughout. Her voice remains steady with hurt but not animated with the fury youd get in a different film. This kind of rational acting might not be for everybody. Weve been conditioned to expect fireworks during a showdown. Dench goes a different direction. She defuses which makes her restraint all the more devastating. Right now Alexander Payne is offering a droll observation of vanishing industrial and agrarian life in Nebraska. But if you crave a version that is ludicrously overwrought there is Out of the Furnace a movie that wants desperately to justify its violence with solemnified images of dead and dying steel plants in Braddock Pennsylvania. Braddock is about nine miles from downtown Pittsburgh and is meant to represent national decline. Scott Cooper directed the film and wrote it with Brad Ingelsby and he loads the story of two brothers and their respective dire straits with big ideas. But the films twin riffs on the stagnation of white masculinity and moribund American industry desperately require unpacking and ignition. Instead theyre used to give sociological ballast to a movie that just wants its physical assaults bare-knuckle boxing matches and stoic revenge to look handsome. The brothers are Russell (Christian Bale) and Rodney Baze (Casey Affleck). Russell toils in a steel mill. Rodney keeps disappearing from Braddock to fight in Iraq. A lifetime in the mill is killing their father. The Great Recession appears to be killing everyone else. Back for good from the war Rodney starts to box for a fixer (Willem Dafoe) then for a vision of druggy backwoods psychosis named Harlan (Woody Harrelson). There is nothing immediately objectionable about this premise. But Cooper begins flashing images of Barack Obamas nomination and election. He offers the embarrassing juxtaposition of Rodneys bloodied face with the image of dead deer. He either quotes from or directly echoes other movies -- The Deer Hunter Heat. What is he trying to get at? Where is he trying to go? A side plot has Russell emerging from prison to find that his ex -- who works with children and is played by Zoe Saldana -- has moved on to another man a police officer played by Forest Whitaker. This is a movie that might have been a great drama at four hours with a more ambitious script and a director with a vision or something to say. Whitakers so good in his couple of otherwise implausible scenes that you start to feel the film has been boiled down from a longer epic. But would two more hours really have made a difference? You never believe that Cooper knows what the gorgeous shots of puffing smokestacks and empty mills mean other than to signify blue-collar grit. You never believe he went beyond asking men like Bale Affleck and Harrelson who acquit themselves ferociously to represent male totems and movie cliches. (Coopers previous movie was the unpersuasive country-music slog Crazy Heart.) Worst of all is the disposable casting of Sam Shepard as a fading symbol of American movie masculinity. (He plays the Baze boys uncle.) At this point simply having him grace your grim adolescent fantasy doesnt confer authenticity or good taste. It implies that you saw him lazing about underused in someone elses movie -- The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford Brothers Safe House Mud -- and had to have him manning yours up too. Out of the Furnace joins Andrew Dominiks Killing Them Softly which also had a small part for Shepard and Derek Cianfrances The Place Beyond the Pines as another youngish directors attempt to do something substantial with violence and style. (The crime thrillers of James Gray have come thrillingly close.) These vacuous grim sometimes grisly movies want to speak to the troubles and fears of our times. But to even have a chance at achieving that a director ought to care about life as its lived outside the movies hes seen.

"Philomena seeks more than the truth review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesPhilomena seeks more than the truth reviewJudi Dench and the comic Steve Coogan make an unlikely but winning pair in Philomena a lost-child dramedy by Stephen Frears.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Nov. 28 2013PhilomenaStarring Judi Dench and Steve Coogan. Directed by Stephen Frears. 98 minutes. Opens Friday at major theatres. PGTwo words along with excellent acting help explain why Philomena transcends the usual odd-couple hijinks wed expect from a pairing of serious Dame Judi Dench and the comic Steve Coogan.The words are ""closure"" and ""reconciliation."" Lay people would use closure to describe what Denchs title character seeks in her quest to learn what happened to her long-lost son.Article Continued BelowThe church would call it reconciliation the name of one of its sacraments (formerly known as confession). It implies that the faithful seeker must not only square with the world but also with God. This is a much more difficult task given the Roman Catholic churchs perfidy in this tale which director Stephen Frears tells from true life.Denchs Philomena is a devout Irish Catholic whose fairground sexploits as a naive teen in the 1950s drastically shaped her life. Young Philomena (played by Sophie Kennedy Clark) wound up getting pregnant and banished to the Magdalene laundries the infamous Catholic workhouse where nuns administered starch and strictures to so-called ""fallen women.""The nuns also made a tidy profit arranging foreign adoptions for the children of these unhappy girls. Childless couples would pay the nuns PS1000 per tot a deal that also included a promise of absolute and eternal secrecy.Philomena lost her 3-year-old son Anthony in this way leaving her with only a single furtive photo of him. She grew up to become a nurse to marry and have another child trying as best she can to put the past behind her. But as Anthony reaches the important age of 50 in 2003 she longs to know what happened to him.She enlists the aid of BBC correspondent Martin Sixsmith whose 2009 book The Lost Child of Philomena Lee informs the screenplay. Sixsmith played by Coogan is a journalist and author in the midst of his own life reckoning an ill-advised foray into working for a politician has left him as the embarrassed ""collateral damage"" for a scandal not of his making.The standard friction ensues. The agnostic Sixsmith neither understands Philomenas continuing devotion to Catholicism nor wishes to sully his lofty reputation with a human interest weeper. The resolutely faithful Philomena a simple but not simple-minded woman cant fathom Sixsmiths cynicism or his habitual rudeness -- and shes not afraid to scold him.Yet they find common cause in their dogged search for Anthony as the trail leads from Ireland to Washington D.C. and fresh clues reveal to what extent the nuns werent doing the Lords work.Philomena becomes something of a thriller but neither Frears nor his two impeccable leads alternately sombre and wry allow it to turn into something akin to the role Dench has been playing in recent 007 pictures.This brings us back to the reconciliation theme above especially since plain closure is dealt with fairly early in the picture. Even as Philomena embraces the expected feel-good dynamics it avoids taking the usual path and doesnt paint all of the ""evil"" nuns with the same brush. There are more sides to this story than just heroes and villains and true reconciliation demands understanding and acceptance beyond simple acquiescence. It demands faith in other words.Dench is reliably great a likely Oscar nominee for Best Actress. But its Coogan who really impresses playing a screen journalist who for once feels true to life. Hes hit-and-miss in his films but he really hits the mark here bearing witness to a phenomenon of spiritual devotion and forgiveness he doesnt completely understand yet stands in awe of nonetheless.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

The British comic and Oscar-winning actress co-star in the film opening Friday Nov. 22 2013 which explores the benefits and costs of faith through the true story of Philomena Lee. (AP Photo/The Weinstein Company Alex Bailey) ( Alex Bailey ) Ask any good chef Why do some recipes work while others with the same ingredients do not? Ah but its the quality of the ingredients that matters that chef will probably say. And so it is with Stephen Frears ""Philomena"" a film whose cinematic recipe seems tricky at best Take a shocking and tragic tale -- a true one involving the Catholic Church no less -- and make it into a film thats part serious drama part jaunty road-buddy movie and part comedy. Such an unwieldy mix flirts with danger even tastelessness but ""Philomena"" works thanks to the quality of its ingredients -- especially the sensitive and nuanced performances by the ever-superb Judi Dench and by Steve Coogan who also co-wrote the script. Director Frears carefully calibrating the tone here is in fine form as he tackles a story based on the 2009 investigative book ""The Lost Son of Philomena Lee"" by Martin Sixsmith. Lee who is still alive is an Irish woman who as a teenager became pregnant during a fairground tryst not even understanding the biology of such things. Rejected at home she was sent to a convent where she endured a painful birth -- and was told the pain was penance for her sin -- then forced to work in the laundry with other ""fallen women"" for years in virtual imprisonment allowed to see her son for one hour a day. Worse yet the convent sold babies to wealthy Americans; Philomenas son Anthony was carried off one day as a toddler without so much as a goodbye to his mother. Advertisement The movie begins on Anthonys 50th birthday with Philomena still desperate to find out what happened to him. Her adult daughter has a chance meeting with Martin Sixsmith a former BBC journalist whos just lost his government job amid scandal and is in need of work. At first Martin rather an Oxford snob dismisses the tale as a ""human interest"" story. But soon Martin and Philomena are heading to Washington D.C. where they make one astonishing discovery after another. And they discover things about each other too. Philomena it turns out is chatty cheerful and fond of romance novels. Martin is rather abrupt and snooty and wants his ""quiet time."" Will these opposites find common ground? Uh have you ever seen a road movie? However theres more happening here thankfully. Philomena despite her devastating treatment by the church remains deeply religious and slow to blame the nuns who mistreated her. Martin is cynical about religion and eager to achieve vindication for Philomena. But is that really what she wants? Along with its religious moral and character issues the film also explores more subtly questions of journalistic ethics. The pairs trip to Washington is paid for by a tabloid keenly interested in the lurid aspects of the tale. But what about Philomenas privacy? Martin is helping her of course but is he exploiting her too for a story? We wouldnt care about any of this if the performances were weak. But both actors find complexity and depth. Dench is not known for playing weak characters but she finds a way to imbue a simple uneducated character with an inner strength and dignity. philomena    1/2Rating PG-13 (for some strong language thematic elements and sexual references)Cast Judi Dench Steve CooganDirector Stephen FrearsRunning time 1 hour 38 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES A Game of Thrones spin-off?

Nov. 15 ""The Book Thief"" Nazi Germany is the setting for this drama about an orphan named Liesel (Sophie Nelisse pictured) whose new parents (the great Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson) secretly harbor a Jewish refugee (Ben Schnetzer pictured). The taut and bittersweet story is based on the best-selling 2006 novel by Markus Zusak. Jules Heath Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. By Ann Hornaday November 26 2013 Follow AnnHornaday For a significant portion of the moviegoing public the words ""Judi Dench"" are enough to send them straight to the closest theater where one of her films might be playing. And for good reason At 78 the British actress has become an international treasure able to play steely formidable characters with as much ease as cozier more grandmotherly roles. All those qualities can be glimpsed in ""Philomena"" in which Dench plays the title character a woman who as a pregnant teenager in 1950s Ireland was forced to give her son up for adoption after giving birth to him in a Catholic abbey. As the soft-spoken slightly frumpy Philomena Lee Dench delivers one of her most recessive unprepossessing performances yet; her dashing silver-haired turn as James Bonds ""M"" is thoroughly banished beneath a staid crown of mousy curls. But that signature brand of Dench tungsten glints through as Philomena embarks on a search for her now-middle-aged son and debates the tenets of her faith with the skeptical journalist chronicling her journey. That ink-stained wretch Martin Sixsmith is winningly played by the British comic actor Steve Coogan who has adapted Sixsmiths book ""The Lost Child of Philomena Lee"" with a tone-perfect mix of acerbity and tenderness. As Martin and Philomena trundle along on a picaresque voyage that takes them from rural Ireland to Washington starting in 2004 his mordant asides -- as often as not having to do with theology and organized religion -- consistently fly over Philomenas head. But the modest provincial Philomena whose steadfast faith Martin condescendingly equates with her taste for lowbrow romance novels tends to get the last word. After delivering a flustered soliloquy on whether he believes in God Martin turns the question to Philomena. ""Do you?"" he asks her. ""Yes"" she says simply. (Later when Martin refers to something as ""evil"" Philomena insists that she doesnt like that word. ""No evils good story-wise"" he reassures her.) If Philomenas devotion is admirable the blind eye she turns to the nuns who took her child is less understandable and Martin serves as a suitably outraged audience surrogate as he reacts to an appalling revelation midway through the film. The depredations of the abbeys where Philomena and her contemporaries were housed were searingly represented in Peter Mullans shattering 2002 drama ""The Magdalene Sisters."" Director Stephen Frears doesnt revisit those horrors but examines their equally sadistic aftermath in which human lives were commodified much like the religious relics sold in the abbeys front vestibule. When Philomena and Martin arrive in Washington the film takes on fascinating added meaning obliquely reminding the audience of an era when homosexuality was the stuff of closeted stigma a time that may seem as antediluvian to some audience members as the shame of an unwed mother in the 1950s. (In this way ""Philomena"" serves as an effective bookend to the equally moving ""Dallas Buyers Club."") But at its core this clever wrenching profound story underscores the tenacity of faith in the face of unfathomable cruelty. Evil may be good story-wise. But virtue at its most tested and tempered is even better.    1/2 PG-13. At area theaters.

Grade A- How would Bill Maher and Pope Francis really get on? Would the Pope be riled or amused by Mahers insistence that the Pope is a secret atheist? That question popped into my mind while watching Stephen Frears ""Philomena."" This touching witty movie stars the phenomenal Judi Dench as Philomena Lee an Irishwoman abused by but still faithful to the Roman Catholic Church. Steve Coogan best known for his runaway comic brilliance gives a restrained effective performance as Martin Sixsmith a lapsed Catholic and Oxford-educated journalist who helps her confront the nuns who delivered her first child and later in effect put the boy up for sale. Coogan who also produced the film and cowrote the script told Charlie Rose that Sixsmiths article about the case in Londons Guardian not his book ""The Lost Child of Philomena Lee"" is what snagged his interest. The picture accompanying the piece sealed it because the photo showed these two dissimilar people laughing and enjoying each other. Coogans instinct was spot-on They prove to be great company for the audience too. Coogan and Jeff Popes script moves confidently on several fronts. With his usual sensitivity and flair Frears depicts Philomenas sad early adulthood from the sparks she strikes with a handsome postal worker at the Limerick Carnival to the loss of her son three years and nine months later. Philomena was one of many Irishwomen sent to the nuns in the 1950s and 1960s for supposedly spiritual reasons - the Church considered unwed mothers unfit for parenthood. But the Church also received one pound a week for each mothers care and two shillings and sixpence for each childs. The women became an indentured-labor pool since those who couldnt pay the nuns 100 pounds were obliged to stay in the convent for three years working in kitchens laundries or craft shops. At the end of that term they signed away any ""claim"" to their children who were then offered for adoption usually to wealthy Americans. In the present-tense story set in 2004 Sixsmith plays sleuth to find where Philomenas son was sent and why he never tried to find her (or so she thinks). The solution of the mystery uncovers a series of heartless Church deceptions as well as the hypocrisy and homophobia of Americans during the height of the AIDS epidemic. The unpredictable rapport between Coogans Sixsmith and Denchs Philomena keeps the film from becoming maudlin. They start out as partners of convenience. Recently fired as a Labour government spin doctor Sixsmith needs a writing project. And Philomena needs someone who can push through locked doors. Frears and his actors beautifully draw the contrast between Sixsmiths cynicism and Philomenas buoy-like faith. Its a quiet thrill to see Coogan and Dench flesh out their clashing world-views. Sixsmith is a Labourite but hes also a snob with a tired sophisticated style. Philomena is an old-fashioned churchgoer but shes also a natural democrat who embraces all of life. Dench turns gags that could be quaint - like Philomenas enthusiasm for a typical hotel breakfast buffet - into captivating revelations of character. She keeps Coogan on the tips of his toes. Here as a serious actor the wild comic Coogan turns out to be a great listener. Picking their way through the Church-created quagmire Dench imbues Philomena with a limitless spiritual generosity - it enables her to forgive even the nuns - while Coogans Sixsmith embodies the strengths and the boundaries of worldliness. Together they draw a consummate portrait of a transcendent friendship.

Starring Judi Dench and Steve Coogan. Directed by Stephen Frears. (PG-13. 98 minutes.) The names havent been changed in ""Philomena."" Its a true story and a remarkable one. In style its a sedate tale of a womans search for the son who was taken from her many years before. But go beyond the manner of its telling and you find a story of cruelty and evil of shocking acts committed under a veneer of civility and sanctity. Steve Coogan who co-adapted the screenplay from the book by Martin Sixsmith plays Sixsmith a middle-aged political writer who finds himself at a career crossroads. A potential human interest story falls into his lap and he decides to pursue it only because hes at loose ends. He meets Philomena Lee a woman of about 70 who has kept a secret for 50 years As a teenager she gave birth to a son and went to live in a convent. When the boy was 3 years old he was adopted and she never saw him again. Judi Dench plays Philomena a rather simple woman who lives just down the road from the Irish convent that screwed up her life. Its a character with many potential pitfalls for an actress all of which Dench avoids as though it were easy. She doesnt sentimentalize Philomena. She gives her a certain nobility without making her noble. Philomena is not nearly as intelligent as Dench is but Dench never steps back to let us see that she knows it. At the same time she finds humor in Philomenas gullibility and in her comical delight in romance novels. By avoiding these pitfalls which is the same as avoiding the temptation of cliche Dench finds a precise characterization of wisdom through simplicity and past suffering - and of the detriments of simplicity and past suffering as well. Her performance is filled with many moments that will have audiences savoring her reactions and reading her mental processes. Dench is so unfussy and so good. The first stop in their search for the lost son is the convent. The new woman in charge who wears a modern habit and an ingratiating manner tells Philomena that she cannot help with her search but she can help her with her suffering. This is good enough for Philomena whose bone-deep probity makes her the least suspicious person on Earth. But Sixsmith with his reporters nose for news knows something is off. He doesnt know what or exactly how but he knows this isnt right. Nuns often get unfair treatment in popular culture when in real life they do much good. But ""Philomena"" tells a true story and the deeper it goes the more appalling it becomes. Evil nuns The details will be best discovered during the movie but in general terms its difficult not to see the behavior of some of these nuns as downright evil. Whats particularly shocking is the ability of some of these women to see the unwed mothers in their charge as almost subhuman as outside the realm of normal consideration. The result was an epic distortion of Christianity with people lobbing first and second stones who had no business even getting near a rock. A light touch ""Philomena"" is a wiser movie than it seems with much to say about justice and forgiveness and the healing of wounds over time. Actually it says next to nothing about any of those things just implies its messages with a light hand. Equally light and deft is the hand of Stephen Frears who directs with his usual meticulous insight into the specifics of human interaction. As Sixsmith Coogan is our doorway not only into the story but into every development of the story. As he sees Philomena so do we and hes an excellent conduit - and surrogate.

To read the whole story subscribe to BostonGlobe.com Philomena Share Comment ""Philomena"" is a tearjerker of rare honesty and craft. The movie is based closely on the story of Philomena Lee (Judi Dench) who in her 70s decided she wanted to find the illegitimate son the Catholic Church took from her and sold in 1950s Ireland. She contacted journalist Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan who co-wrote and co-produced) and the unlikely pair of elitist reporter and plainspoken nurse embarked on a long strange journey to the truth. The movie steers clear of sentimentality at every turn Whats most shocking about Philomena is her ordinariness and whats ultimately most moving is her faith in that ordinariness--that the crime committed by her church and country didnt separate her from humanity but only made her part of it.

Comments click to enlarge Philomena Recommended Rated PG-13  97 minutes  2013 Adapted from a book by Martin Sixsmith this absorbing drama recounts the British journalists relationship with Philomena Lee an Irish woman who bore a child out of wedlock in the 1950s and was forced by nuns at the Roscrea convent to surrender it for adoption. The movie opens in 2004 as Sixsmith (Steve Coogan) begins researching a magazine story about Lee (Judi Dench) and her efforts to track down the child; their search leads them to Washington DC where a poignant and ironic twist of fate points them back across the Atlantic to the convent. Coogan continuing his metamorphosis from neurotic clown to nuanced dramatic actor (What Maisie Knew The Look of Love) produced the film and collaborated with Jeff Pope on the screenplay; its comic moments many of them predicated on Lees frank statements about sex are a little cute for my taste but the story touches on some of the thorniest issues of Catholic doctrine and tempers its righteous anger with a tone more sad than bitter. Stephen Frears (The Queen Dirty Pretty Things) directed; with Mare Winningham and Barbara Jefford. By J.R.

Matt Gillmer Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Judi Dench plays the title role in ""Philomena"" with her usual authenticity which is reason enough to see it but there are so many more. The film grapples with moral and ethical issues -- misdeeds of Irelands Catholic Church varieties of sexual repression journalistic cynicism -- while maintaining a rollicking sense of humor. Its a real-life story (based on Martin Sixsmiths 2009 book ""The Lost Child of Philomena Lee"") dramatized in a way that respects the facts and also touches the heart. Expertly directed by Stephen Frears (""The Queen"") and beautifully written by Steve Coogan who co-stars as Sixsmith the film portrays honesty courage and decency without stumbling into easy sentimentality. Raised in an Irish orphanage by nuns who taught no courses in reproductive health teenaged Philomena found herself pregnant after one evening out with a handsome lad. She was coerced by the sisters to give up her 3-year-old Anthony for adoption. Half a century later the devout goodhearted retiree wants to find out where her boy is. ""I just want to know if hes ever thought of me"" she tells Sixsmith. ""Ive thought of him every day."" Oxford-educated Sixsmith loathes the idea ""I dont do human interest stories because its a euphemism for stories aimed at weak-minded ignorant people."" Still hes in the throes of a midlife crisis. His jobs as a political PR consultant and BBC correspondent having gone belly up. Swallowing his pride he pitches Philomenas story to a tabloid editor as a story about ""evil nuns."" The condescending intellectual and the sweet old dear follow the adoption trail to the United States in an odd-couple comedy much smarter funnier and angrier than most. Weinstein Co. Judi Dench and Steve Coogan in ""Philomena."" The film has the age-old appeal of a conspiracy story with the investigators meeting obstruction at every turn. The films stronger hand though is the byplay between two top performers cast opposite their usual type. Dench is no starchy authority figure but a gauche unpretentious pensioner fond of romance novels. Coogan plays a straighter version of the elitist twits that are his usual stock in trade. The films plot is one of the most unpredictable in recent memory a veritable barrage of dramatic bombshells. Along the way Sixsmith born Catholic and turned outspoken atheist and Philomena who never drifted from faith despite her churchs transgressions have illuminating unforced discussions about guilt God faith and forgiveness. When they confront a religious figure central to Anthonys disappearance the scene honors both Philomenas clemency and Sixsmiths righteous ire. Smart sensitive serious without being solemn this is a human interest story perfectly told. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

"Philomena 4 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article Philomena 4 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED NEWS Interview Director Stephen Frears By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Tue Nov 26 2013 1109 AM Sometimes gentle humor is the best way to tell a horrific story. And thats what ""Philomena"" is at least in part the story of a woman cruelly mistreated by the Catholic Church. Yet it is also a story of redemption forgiveness and faith genuine on all fronts. And it features a terrific performance by Judi Dench though the quality of her work is probably the least-surprising if most-welcome aspect of the film. Director Stephen Frears manages to successfully walk the tricky line between comedy and dark drama. It keeps the audience off-kilter a bit but in a good way; we shouldnt always need to know whats coming next in terms of tone or plot. The script co-written by co-star Steve Coogan and Jeff Pope is based on a book called ""The Lost Child of Philomena Lee"" by former BBC foreign correspondent Martin Sixsmith. Thats who Coogan plays at a point in his career when hes just been sacked as a spin doctor in Tony Blairs administration. Hes casting about for something to do (and seriously considering writing a book about Russian history a running joke with a good payoff) when a chance meeting at a party leads him to an idea for a lowly lifestyle story or so he deems it. A woman named Philomena (Dench) decides she wants to find out what happened to the son she gave birth to at Sean Ross Abbey in Ireland a strict convent. Like other girls in her situation pregnant and unmarried she was put to brutal work in a laundry working long hours every day a virtual slave providing labor for (and receiving constant judgment from) the sisters who are always ready to remind the girls of their ""carnal incontinence."" They are allowed to see their children one hour per day until the children are sold to wealthy parents. Yes sold. (Peter Mullans 2002 film ""The Magdalene Sisters"" is based on the girls who worked in the laundries.) Eventually a family comes for Philomenas son; she must watch through a window as the car pulls away with her boy inside. Sixsmith finally decides there might be something there so he and Philomena visit the abbey where they are told all the records were destroyed in a fire. All except the contract Philomena signed saying she wouldnt look into her sons whereabouts. This both intrigues and infuriates Sixsmith who now goes after the story with gusto (and arrogance and rudeness). He and Philomena travel to Washington D.C. to search for her son. What they find is maddening heartbreaking and surprising. Yet Philomena takes it all in including more information about the practices of the abbey as well as the Reagan administration and others with a sort of grace that is astonishing. Too astonishing? Maybe in the abstract. But Dench perfectly captures a woman whose belief is severely tested more so than most of us can imagine yet who comes out the other side with genuine faith. Sixsmith an atheist doesnt quite know what to make of that but he clearly admires it. Coogan is also good barely concealing Sixsmiths exasperation with the chatty Philomena or his disdain for most everyone else. Its an odd pairing he and Dench but it works. ""Philomena"" could have been a sappy movie but its not. Instead with such assured performances its proof that sometimes a laugh makes swallowing a big dose of outrage a little easier.

"Philomena (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Philomena (PG-13) Judi Dench and Steve Coogan star in this comic drama about a woman who waged war on Irelands adoption laws. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle cogleMiamiHerald.com11/26/2013 Editor rating 3 Philomena is a good movie about a terrible injustice that continued for decades in Ireland and affected thousands of young women. Based on a true story -- one that you will marvel at by the end of the film so remarkable and infuriating is the outcome -- the film details the search of Philomena Lee (Judi Dench) for her son 50 years after he was put up for adoption by a Catholic orphanage and workhouse that made virtual slaves of the disgraced and traumatized young women it took in. Irelands brutish adoption laws stonewall any attempt to track down an adopted child after the fact and so Philomena still half-believing she deserved what happened to her for getting pregnant has gone on with her life (we dont learn much about her past beyond the fact she has a grown daughter and used to be a nurse). But on her sons 50th birthday she finds herself staring at the one photograph she has of him and knows she has to find him. Enter Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan who also co-wrote the script and produced the film) a former BBC correspondent and recent civil servant dumped from his Downing Street job amid controversy. With nothing but time on his hands Martin is threatening to write a book on Russian history even though the mere mention of it sends everyone else into spasms of boredom. Then he runs into Philomenas daughter at a party and she pitches her mothers plight as a human interest story. He pitches it to an editor (Michelle Fairley of Game of Thrones) and soon he has an an assignment File a story that is fabulously happy or a desperately sad. Either one is acceptable the editor tells him. Anything in-between will not suffice. Much of the beauty of Philomena which was directed by Stephen Frears (The Queen) lies in its odd-couple characters and the superb actors portraying them. Martin and Philomena are two very different sorts of people who baffle and surprise each other but who cant help but grow close as the search goes on. Coogan plays Sixsmith (who wrote the book on which the film is based) as a casually snobbish upper-middle-class smoothie impatient at working-class Philomenas appetite for romance novels and salad bars (when he goes out to eat he dines in a little bistro around the corner he tells her). Dench of course is marvelous and her no-nonsense presence grounds the film and keeps it from growing maudlin. There are lessons to be learned by Martin of course but they are not all predictable ones and what could become cloying turns out to be heartfelt in the hands of Coogan and fellow screenwriter Jeff Pope. They also get big laughs with Philomenas frank and clinical pronouncements on sex which are as startling to the audience as they are to Martin (she is a nurse after all). Earlier this year Ireland officially apologized to the 10000 or so women forced into the workhouses; many refused to accept the overture understandably so. They might however appreciate the makers of Philomena for putting the countrys dreadful policy in the spotlight. Cast Judi Dench Steve Coogan Michelle Fairley Mare Winningham.

The Weinstein CO. This image released by The Weinstein Company shows Judi Dench left and Steve Coogan in a scene from ""Philomena."" The British comic and Oscar-winning actress co-star in the film opening Friday Nov. 22 2013 which explores the benefits and costs of faith through the true story of Philomena Lee. (AP Photo/The Weinstein Company Alex Bailey) Critics invoke the term ""dramedy"" to describe a hybrid of comedy and drama but you wont find it on many movie posters. Mainstream audiences are allergic to irony and want their tears and laughter served on separate plates. Its smart marketing that ""Philomena"" is billed as a comedy but this adoption drama lands more gut punches than belly laughs.Inspired by true and tragic events ""Philomena"" is the story of one Irish woman but she represents many others. When Philomena Lee was 15 the Catholic schoolgirl was impregnated by a charming stranger gave birth to a boy she called Anthony and lived the next few years of her life in a convent.While Philomena worked in the laundry to pay back the nuns for their ""kindness"" she was allowed to see her son for one hour per day. When he was 3 the boy was wrested from Philomena and sold to adoptive parents from America. She never saw him again. Almost 50 years later Philomena told her tale to British journalist Martin Sixsmith who accompanied her on a transcontinental journey to find the now-grown son.Dry-as-toast comedian Steve Coogan optioned the story wrote a script with uncharacteristic warmth and co-stars as Sixsmith. But ""Philomena"" belongs to Judi Dench.Although the Oscar-winning actress is battling eye and memory problems this is a robust achievement. Her Philomena is a reverent and even cheerful woman who worked as a nurse for decades and has never questioned the faith that forced her to surrender her son as atonement for the sin she admittedly enjoyed. On a too-close-for-comfort road trip to the convent atheist Sixsmith is shocked that Philomena bears no ill will toward the nuns who claim to have reformed yet keep secrets behind locked doors.But when the investigation takes the odd couple to Washington D.C. he is disarmed by her simplicity as she prattles about romance novels and marvels at the portion sizes of American breakfasts. It is hard to overlook that Sixsmith is about the same age as the mysterious son and that they followed similar political paths but although theres a twist its not the manipulative sort. Dench Coogan and sure-handed director Stephen Frears (""The Queen"") keep the focus on character and in ""Philomena"" theyve got an earthbound angel.What ""Philomena""  Three stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 138  Content Some strong language and sexual references Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

"Philomena | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; philomena ) Philomena (United Kingdom/United States 2013) November 25 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Part mystery investigation part mismatched buddy film and part condemnation of inhumane attitudes in 1950s Ireland and 1980s Washington Philomena falls into the category of ""too unbelievable to be fiction."" Faithfully based on the true story told in Martin Sixsmiths 2009 book The Lost Child of Philomena Lee the movie recounts the journey taken by Sixsmith (Steve Coogan) from Ireland to Washington in the company of sixtysomething Philomena Lee (Judi Dench) to search of the son who was stolen from her nearly five decades earlier. The film directed with a minimum of emotional manipulation by veteran Stephen Frears is at times funny and uplifting but the lighter elements dont conceal the deep underlying tragedy a mother and son desperately trying to find each other stymied by people desperate to protect their secrets and unable to reconnect before one of them dies. Philomena uses flashbacks to tell the genesis of events. Philomena pregnant and disowned by her family gives birth to a son at an Irish convent in the early 1950s. She is kept there virtually a prisoner for three years toiling for the nuns as compensation for the ""costs"" incurred by her labor. Her son Anthony is sold to a wealthy American couple. Philomena will never see him again and prevented by a document she signed from being entitled to records surrounding his adoption she lives to old age haunted by regret. Not until meeting journalist Sixsmith in 2004 is she able to do something about it. Utilizing his investigative instincts Sixsmith determines that Anthony was taken to the United States. Following the cold trail the odd couple flies to Washington where Sixsmith discovers that Anthony renamed Michael Hess was a rising star in the Republican Party during the 1980s ascending to the position of Chief Legal Counsel for George H.W. Bush. A closeted gay man Michael died in 1995 of AIDS. While the discovery of her Michael/Anthonys death might seem to be the end of the story it instead represents a beginning as Philomena and Sixsmith seek to reconstruct his life and learn what kind of person he was. Although the screenplay contains samples of Steve Coogans trademark dry humor its mostly a serious effort as befits the story it tells. Philomena is as much a detective story as a character-based piece although the convolutions of Sixsmiths intensive investigation have been necessarily watered-down and condensed to make them cinematic. The film contains elements of the ""mismatched buddy"" story with Philomena and Sixsmith starting out as reluctant allies with very different views on religion before developing a strong friendship and the ""fish out of water"" tradition with provincial Philomena overwhelmed by the U.S. in the early 2000s. The most poignant relationship detailed in Philomena is the one between the title character and her dead son. Frears and actress Judi Dench exhibiting her range in a performance that will end up on the short list for Oscar nominations manage the difficult task of causing the audience to care about this exhumation of the past and its occasionally surprising revelations. Theres more emotion than one might initially expect sadness at the missed opportunities frustration and anger at the self-serving and shallow motivations of people and institutions and quiet satisfaction at the way Philomena achieves closure. Frears isnt subtle in the way he condemns the actions of the Irish Catholic Church during the 1950s. With Coogan playing the part of his proxy the director levels a vicious blow against the institution the likes of which hasnt been seen on screen since The Magdalene Sisters. Hes equally critical of the homophobia of the 1980s United States especially for those with an allegiance to the Republican Party. Philomena a portrait of tolerance and forgiveness stands in counterpoint to the anger expressed by Sixsmith. Philomena is low-key and developed in a very anti-Hollywood fashion. Frears never artificially amps up the emotional beats. Its simple and well-told although nothing about it is breathtakingly original. In the movie Philomenas tale is repeatedly referred to as a ""human interest story"" and indeed thats what it proves to be.

By Peter Rainer Film critic November 22 2013 Save for later Saved Philomena Lee (Judi Dench) and Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan) are going the same way - in search of her long-lost child - in Philomena. The Weinstein Company/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The first thing you have to overcome while watching ""Philomena"" is the spectacle of Judi Dench playing a quietly reserved Irish woman who laps up trashy romance novels and gets her kicks watching ""Big Mommas House.""But have no fear Dench is such a consummate actress that Philomenas proclivities soon appear perfectly natural. Just because Dench is great at playing smart doesnt mean she cant also play not-so-smart. As a matter of fact the actresss intelligence in this regard is probably an asset. (Judy Holliday the quintessential dumb blonde of ""Born Yesterday"" was reportedly a brainiac). Actually Philomena Lee although the movie sometimes confers upon her a slight condescension isnt all that stupid just incurious. She lives a homespun circumscribed life - except for one thing. Fifty years earlier after becoming pregnant following a youthful indiscretion she was forced by her parents into a convent where she was worked like a packhorse and allowed to see her baby boy for just one hour each day. Three years later the baby was sold to an American couple and forever after not a day has gone by without Philomena wondering what became of him.Her daughter upon learning of this long-held secret reaches out to Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan) a former BBC reporter and government spokesman (i.e. spin doctor) who sees Philomenas story as his human-interest ticket back into journalism. Recommended 14 acting legends over 70 Based on Sixsmiths 2009 nonfiction book ""The Lost Child of Philomena Lee"" and directed by Stephen Frears ""Philomena"" is a straightforward recounting of how this odd couple journeyed from Ireland to Washington D.C. and then back to Ireland in search of answers. 14 acting legends over 70 Monitor Movie Guide Coogan who co-wrote the script with Jeff Pope sets up these people as polar opposites Shes a God-fearing Roman Catholic who despite what was perpetrated by the convent holds no malice. She simply wants to know about her son. Martin by contrast is a devout atheist who is enraged by what happened to her and cant sanction her forgiveness.This is all rather schematic. At times the filmmakers seem to be taking potshots at Philomena for her placidity; other times Martin is made to seem crass and unfeeling - insufficiently spiritual. Life lessons are imparted although the players never budge very much from their initial attitudes.The search for the son as it slowly ensues is gripping and leads into byways one would not expect. The road movie becomes a detective story that opens up a fresh wound even as it closes another. Frears doesnt make a big show out of any of this. He holds back from the big tear-jerky moments that a lesser director would have hit home.But theres also an old-fashioned aspect to his work here that is a bit dozy. If not for the expertness of his actors ""Philomena"" would be a sloggy journey indeed. Fortunately Dench and Coogan are more than capable of turning water into wine.

It pairs one of the most beloved figures in world cinema (Judi Dench) with an acidic British star whos never broken through in America and is looking to reboot his career (Steve Coogan). You get exactly one guess as to which member of this odd couple is the guileless innocent who needs a bit more steel in her spine and which one is the hard-boiled cynic who lacks a heart. Furthermore ""Philomena"" also represents the latest comeback effort for English director Stephen Frears whos been cranking out workmanlike pictures since his 1980s heyday with only intermittent success. (""The Queen"" and ""Dirty Pretty Things"" would be his best movies of this millennium.)Fortunately if and when youre able to shovel those contextual questions to the back of your mind and watch the movie ""Philomena"" turns out to be a subtly told tale of tragedy and redemption with much of the sentimental payoff youre expecting but several intriguing plot twists along the way. This is Coogans project to a significant extent. He produced the film and co-wrote the screenplay (with Jeff Pope) which is based on a real-life tabloid story (ultimately a book ""The Lost Child of Philomena Lee"") that mesmerized the British public. But he understands where the heart of the film lies nicely underplaying the role of Martin Sixsmith a one-time star journalist and political apparatchik who has been ousted in a government scandal and is seeking both a payday and a way to relaunch his career. Martin has a bit in common with Coogan himself a huge comedy star in British TV whose boundlessly insincere persona has never translated to the big screen.At first when Martin hears the story of Philomena Lee (Dench) an Irish-born retired nurse whose illegitimate child was forcibly taken from her 50 years ago and literally sold off to new parents he dismisses it as a ""human-interest story."" What that means he helpfully explains to the young woman pitching him the idea - shes pouring wine at some chattering-class party and has overheard him discussing his career dilemma - is that its really a story about ""weak-minded and ignorant people"" written for the kinds of newspapers read by weak-minded and ignorant people. Indeed when Martin agrees to meet Philomena (Dench) he can barely conceal his condescension as she chatters on about romance novels and her new titanium hip and is puzzled by his sardonic Oxbridge sense of humor. But as an editor he met at that party has told him its a great story as long as the ending is ""really really happy or really really sad."" Its not too much of a spoiler to say Some of bothSpeaking as someone with numerous aunts and cousins of approximately Philomenas class and background I felt a bit leery about seeing the most eminent English stage actress of our time play an Irish immigrant from a working-class background. I neednt have worried; this is Judi Dench were talking about and she gets it all right from Philomenas quilted jackets to her concealed religious torment to the fact that shes a good deal more worldly and intelligent than she lets on. We never see the inside of Philomenas house with its knickknacks in Belleek china a work-basket and crossword shelf next to her TV chair and the exposed Sacred Heart of Jesus overlooking the staircase but I have no doubt theyre there. (Philomena is a bit too aspirational I am guessing for the paired portraits of John Paul II and John F. Kennedy.) Nor is there any hint of stage-Irish to her speech; Philomena is after all a convent-educated girl from the Irish midlands not some sort of bog-woman with no manners at all if you please. You Might Also Like Philomena Lees story became famous because it was a dramatic tale with unexpected twists and turns but also because what happened to her happened to thousands of other Irish girls and young women between the Depression and the late 1960s. Those were the years of greatest cultural isolation in Ireland when the Roman Catholic Church exercised unchallenged ideological hegemony and family secrets of all kinds were swept under the carpet especially when they involved carnal sin. Unmarried young women who became pregnant - all forms of contraception were of course illegal and even discussing abortion was unthinkable - had disgraced their families their communities their sex and their nation. Many were abandoned to a system of convent workhouses known as the ""Magdalen laundries"" where they were worked as slave labor and birthed babies who were given away to generous donors often affluent American Catholics.When Martin and Philomena go back to the convent in the Irish countryside where Philomena had her baby boy 50 years ago everything seems to have changed. The nuns who ran the place in the bad old days are all gone (or so we believe at first) and the youngish woman whos in charge now welcomes them with tea and cake and would love to help - if only all the records hadnt been destroyed in that ever-so-convenient fire Philomena still regards herself as a good Catholic and is inclined to thank the sisters for their hospitality and go back home. But Martins reportorial instincts have been engaged and hes beginning to change his mind about whether the stoical Philomena is such an ignorant and weak-minded person after all. Once the BBC correspondent in Washington Martin is able to call on his connections to determine that Philomenas son did indeed emigrate to America as a 2-year-old and grew up there under a different name. So the duo relocate to a D.C. luxury hotel - Philomena is enthralled by the chocolates on the pillow and lets Martin know he can borrow the plush bathrobe in her suite any time he likes - and I wont go much further than that. Except we can say that identifying Philomenas son and finding out what became of him turns out to be the easy part. Earlier in the film Martin muses out loud that the boys fate is irrelevant ""He could be president of IBM or he could be a hobo. It really doesnt matter."" But it does. As the unexpected truth emerges Philomena has to face her most profound fears about her long-lost son and Martin must face the fact that this noble and tormented woman is both braver and stronger than hes ever been in his entire life. (All I will add is that hearing Judi Dench say the word ""bi-curious"" is its own reward.)Ultimately its too easy - too Martin-like - to dismiss ""Philomena"" as formulaic Harvey Weinstein holiday fare. Dench and Coogan have such wonderfully prickly chemistry together and are so full of surprises that their relationship never feels fake and Frears is not a director to overmilk moments of sentiment. Both Philomena and Martin have to give up long-cherished ideas about themselves and even embrace a politics of confrontation before Philomena can find her lost child at last. Is Dench in line for yet another Oscar nomination here? She might be but far more important ""Philomena"" really is that rarest of commodities a holiday movie for the entire family from kids of 11 or so on up to grandma that will insult no one and leave no one out.

Until those damnable institutions closed forever in 1996 young women worked eight to ten hours 364 days a year worn down by taunting lectures on the evils of the flesh and frequent beatings. They were also forced to give up all rights to their out-of-wedlock children. Peter Mullans 2003 The Magdalene Sisters was too arty and grueling to get much traction outside Ireland and the U.K. but the new Judi Dench-Steve Coogan vehicle Philomena is just the sort of awards-bait weeper (with laughs) to cross over to a biggish audience. Directed by Stephen Frears from a script by Coogan and Jeff Pope the movie is overcalculating and occasionally coarse but it has a gentle spirit. We should count its existence as a blessing. Philomena is real a I heard her go on at charming length after a recent screening a and is the subject of a book called The Lost Child of Philomena Lee by Brit journalist Martin Sixsmith. A former nurse she reportedly got tipsy on sherry one night in 2004 and let go of a secret shead kept for half a century In 1952 she gave birth to a son at Sean Ross Abbey a convent in Tipperary county and was compelled to sign the lucrative adoption rights over to the Superioress Sister Barbara. Three years later the boy Anthony was taken from her a on Christmas Day no less. Now she wanted to find him with all her soul. Sixsmith heard the story from a friend of Leeas daughter. Having nothing else to do at the moment a head been thrown under a bus by the Blair administration a he decided to chronicle Leeas search. Coogan plays Sixsmith whos made extra snobbish and unpleasant to fit snugly into the actors limited range. This creates a crowd-pleasing mismatched-buddy vibe as the Oxford-educated writer (chagrined at having to write a ""human interest"" story to pay the bills) and the working-class Philomena motor around Ireland and later the U.S. She fills him in on the plots of sundry romance novels he rolls his eyes at her simplemindedness she proves she sees more than he thinks she does. Less hokey is their conflict over the presence/absence of God. Sixsmith makes little distinction between a belief in a supreme being and in the liars opportunists and criminals who exist at all levels of the church. Philomena despite the cruelty she has endured persists in accepting both the Trinity and the legitimacy of its material-world emissaries. Some of them anyway. Dame Judi doesnt transcend the over-tidy script but she de-banalizes it. Her elfin face is here soft and guileless; her eyes shine. She lets us see that Philomenas idle chatter -- her homilies her breathless plot synopses -- isnt so idle after all. Its her stubborn romanticism and sense of wonder that has pulled this woman though. Philomena fights every day against the idea of her own guilt. As a girl she didnt know not to let boys touch her private parts -- because neither the sisters nor her church-fearing relatives told her what they were for. (""I didnt even know I had a clitoris Martin."") And if theres no sex education how can you know where the caresses of a handsome attentive boy at a carnival will lead? In flashbacks Philomena is played by a radiant pink-cheeked lass named Sophie Kennedy Clark and though she doesnt quite match up with Dench in your minds eye shes awfully moving. Possibly you know -- from news accounts -- where Philomenas journey leads. If not Ill let you discover the outcome for yourself. I will say that there turn out to be several varieties of sexual repression in the film and that the ironies multiply You cant as the saying goes make this stuff up. Its also fascinating to note that however tyrannized our own politicians might be by the religious right the U.S. comes off far better than the Old Country. The most chilling scenes in Philomena are at the abbey where the child was born. A few decades ago it took all the birth and adoption records and had itself a nice bonfire. Now church administrators have learned to lie gracefully. (""We cant take away your pain but we can walk you through it ..."") When Coogans Sixsmith makes a stink and uses foul language in the presence of elderly priests and nuns hes treated as something of a lost soul but at least one viewer wished hed smashed a few stained-glass windows. Director Frears isnt given to torturing the audience a la Mullan in The Magdalene Sisters -- or for that matter Frearss fellow Englishman Steve McQueen in 12 Years a Slave. He isnt a Catholic either so hes not working out any of his own childhood traumas. Frearss tender somewhat impersonal touch keeps Philomena from becoming too much of an anti-Catholic harangue which is probably for the best. The real Philomena Lee can see the movie with her fellow parishioners and not be viewed as a troublemaker. She can go to her grave knowing that she killed her oppressors with kindness.

""I used to be."" ""Hes a Roman Catholic."" ""Well I used to be..."" Philomena Lee (Judi Dench) is trying to speak for the bona fides of a reluctant Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan) at one point in Stephen Frears ""Philomena"" but she fails to address her own tentative state of being shes a mother (well she used to be). As a young woman pregnant out of wedlock in the 1950s Philomena (played in flashbacks by Sophie Kennedy Clark) was shipped off to an Irish-Catholic convent and saw her boy Anthony sold to wealthy new parents without her consent. For years she abided by the convents agreement not to pursue his whereabouts but in 2003 a regret-stricken Philomena (Dench) agrees to have Sixsmiths disgraced journalist document her journey to America in an effort to find out what became of dear Anthony. Based as it is on the real experiences of Sixsmith and Lee ""Philomena"" provides as much an opportunity for recovery by director Frears (""The Grifters"" ""The Queen"" and most recently ""Lay the Favorite"") as it does for Coogans Martin who is initially above the notion of doing a soft human interest story -- a far cry from his former spin doctor duties with the Prime Minister -- before succumbing to the inherently salacious promise of the piece. ""Evil nuns"" he eagerly jots down before assuring a nonplussed Philomena that ""evil is good story-wise."" Having co-written the film with Jeff Pope Coogans character and screenplay exude an equal cynicism towards the institutions of journalism politics and religion and whenever it seems that Frears and friends are making the featherweight odd-couple comedy promised in the ads a series of well-timed surprises and an undercurrent of longing propel the duo forth on their journey. Dont get me wrong; there are some lovely and amusing exchanges along the way with Philomena marveling at the first-class luxuries of renting something called ""Big Mommas House"" from the comfort of her hotel room and Martin trying to fathom how every other stranger she meets could possibly be ""one in a million."" That bittersweet balance is itself thoroughly embodied by Denchs performance. Her Philomena comes to compassion easily is a bit naive at times (but never senile) and even reveals a fierce determination when the occasion calls for it. Although tickled by the opportunity to finally travel abroad the septuagenarian is also keenly aware of the role she serves in Martins story (and by extension his career narrative). Furthermore she is driven by a deep-seated lament for the child she never knew matched by a frustration as to the value of any faith that has robbed her life of such joy. All told its a remarkably well-realized turn from one of our greater living actresses and although its hard to see Martin as little more than the usual Coogan type -- sarcastic self-deprecating opportunistic -- in comparison he serves as a much-needed angry atheistic foil to a woman defined by hope as much as woe. Frears direction meanwhile simply serves the story allowing his leads to discover what they must as they must until reaching a climax which provokes two very valid emotional extremes. At this point and even before ""Philomena"" honors its namesake by valuing potent understatement over potential hysterics.

But in the brutally medieval ""Magdalene asylums"" fixtures for years in many Catholic countries no such fine distinctions were ever made. For centuries young girls - many of them pregnant teenagers some simply intractable -- were sent to the church-run institutions where they labored in the laundries. Their babies were taken away. Their terms of service were indefinite. In Ireland the last one closed in 1996. This awful story of abuse has been told before in documentaries and in Peter Mullans very fine ""The Magdalene Sisters."" The new film ""Philomena"" takes a different approach though. It looks at one of those girls 50 years later -- and follows her as she tries to find the son she had to give up. And its based on fact. This is a pretty rich background for a film and the credits are impressive as well. It is directed by Stephen Frears the veteran filmmaker whose last hit was ""The Queen."" It stars the formidable Judi Dench as the title character and Steve Coogan (who spearheaded this movie project and co-wrote the script) as the journalist who tells her story. Yet the film occasionally disappoints -- usually when otherwise briskly directed by Frears it turns into a forced odd-couple roadtrip. Dench is one of our greatest actresses but shes too often asked to play the dotty old Irishwoman here watching her stories on the telly and gushing over paperback romances. And Coogan plays only a slightly milder version of the smart and sarcastic media crank hes done for years. They do these familiar characters well of course; Dench remains a treasure (and a bit of a sentimental favorite for an Oscar nomination). But sticking them in a rental car and having them squabble as they drive about feels a bit like a failure of nerve screenwriter Coogan continually pushing things towards the comfortably comic. The film is terrific though when it returns to the religious aspects that Coogan says originally caught his attention. Because ""Philomena"" isnt just a story about sin (although Frears does linger a bit on that apple the young girl takes a bite of before being seduced) or about penance or even abuse but about faith. Coogan was raised Catholic and the hypocrisies and horrors of this story clearly hit him in the way they can only strike those who still remember weekly confession fish on Fridays and kneeling unquestioningly at the altar rail. You put your trust in these people. When some betray you you cant help but boil with rage. Or not and heres the truly interesting idea at the core of the film -- Philomena doesnt doubt doesnt question hasnt lost her faith even now. Shes the real victim here yet shes become what those brutal nuns only professed to be -- accepting of her trials understanding of her enemies committed to genuine love. Its a rich irony -- and not only the real conflict between its two characters but the true heart of the story. Because there is a difference between forgetting and forgiving. And it takes the wisest of people to know the difference and to be strong enough to make the right choice. Ratings note The film contains some strong language. Philomena (PG-13) Weinstein (98 min.)

Murray Close/Lionsgate The Hunger Games Catching Fire Director Francis Lawrence Genre Action adventure Running Time 146 minutes Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action some frightening images thematic elements a suggestive situation and language With Jennifer Lawrence Josh Hutcherson Liam Hemsworth Philomena Director Stephen Frears Genre Drama Running Time 98 minutes Rated PG-13 for some language With Judi Dench Steve Coogan (Recommended) Its a fact of Hollywood life that the movie industry is dominated by men. Male stars make more money. Male executives make more decisions. And the vast majority of films are about what men do or think or blow up. But this weekend two heroines are the backbone -- the impressively sturdy backbone -- of two very different pictures. When it comes to dystopian fiction there arent a lot of characters Id rather have on my side than Katniss Everdeen. The 17-year-old warrior heroine of Catching Fire -- Part 2 of the four-part Hunger Games ""trilogy"" if you can get your head around that -- may wear more eye shadow than Cleopatra this time but that doesnt mean shes not fierce. Sent to do battle in the life-and-death TV ritual her totalitarian society uses to help subjugate its citizens Katiss (Jennifer Lawrence) is an archer who can take out a saber-toothed baboon at 50 paces -- and a strategist who you just know will get the better of Donald Sutherlands evil dictator President Snow and his new strategist Plutarch Heavensbee (Phillip Seymour Hoffman). The first Hunger Games movie was a jittery hand-held-camera affair but Catching Fire has a new director Francis Lawrence and plenty of money for special effects. (Taking in 700 million will do that for a series.) i Philomena (Judi Dench) proves to have her own strength as she and journalist Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan) set out on a search for her stolen son. Alex Bailey/The Weinstein Company hide caption toggle caption Alex Bailey/The Weinstein Company Philomena (Judi Dench) proves to have her own strength as she and journalist Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan) set out on a search for her stolen son. Alex Bailey/The Weinstein Company Being a sequel it starts in the middle without much exposition though theres still an hour-plus of flaming-costume fittings and chariot parades before Katniss gets to kick behind. Personally Ill be happier when she ditches the eye shadow for the revolution but thats the third Hunger Games book not the second; its going to be split into two movies and given the strength of this installment Id say the box-office odds continue to be in that Hunger Games catchphrase ""ever in its favor."" Katniss tends to look skeptically at the men in her life but she does take advice from a hard-drinking fatalist Haymitch played by Woody Harrelson. And in Philomena a true story about battling a dictatorial society in the recent past the title character (Judi Dench) also has a male fatalist around to nudge her into action Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan) a journalist turned government spokesman whod fallen on hard times in 2004. Once the BBCs ""man in Moscow"" Sixsmith has been reduced to scrounging at cocktail parties for a way back into journalism mostly hearing story ideas he immediately resists. One story though sticks with him an unmarried Irish teenager sent by her Catholic family to have her baby in a convent. The child is then taken from her and put up for adoption and the nuns stonewall her questions for decades. The two meet and click -- awkwardly -- and there they are a humor-challenged working-class grandmother yearning for her long-lost son and a snarky upper-crust writer yearning for redemption. Matched recovery stories Hows that for human interest? Director Stephen Frears working from a book by the real Martin Sixsmith isnt about to let the Irish church off the hook for a monstrous (and well-documented) chapter in its history. In flashbacks he pictures the young Philomena as a sort of proto-Katniss doing battle with a tyranny of nuns. That this rebel grew up to be Denchs chatterbox of an older Philomena does exasperate Coogans Martin. But hell discover theres steel in her too. And that allows a story that might have been mined purely for tears and anger to inspire both laughter and a startling degree of forgiveness.

Whenever she needs another Katniss Everdeen simply reaches over her shoulder knowing one will be there. Thats not to quarrel with her self-replenishing quiver. It contributes to the pace of action sequences that hurtle along with exuberant style and authority. Better still its a fitting accessory for the star Jennifer Lawrence who has so many arrows in her actors quiver that they seem to be multiplying from one movie to the next. Watch a clip from ""The Hunger Games Catching Fire"" starring Jennifer Lawrence and Woody Harrelson. (Photo/Video Lionsgate) In this second installment of the trilogy Ms. Lawrence stands runs shoots and suffers at the center of a production thats worthy of her formidable gifts and of the Suzanne Collins novel on which the film is based. That wasnt the case in the first one which started sluggishly then worked itself into various lathers without enhancing the dramatic core of sacrifice and personal integrity in a struggle for survival. This time all the elements--the garish spectacle the devious politics the kill-or-be-killed combat under a vast invisible dome--work in concert to heighten Katnisss plight as the pawn of a repressive government that stages the games in the form of a television show to distract its citizens from their miserable lives. ""Catching Fire"" is exceptional entertainment a spectacle with a good mind and a pounding heart. Francis Lawrence directed expertly from a sharp lucid screenplay by Simon Beaufoy and Michael deBruyn. The cinematography by Jo Willems is especially spectacular in IMAX. The film opens with a striking image Katniss seen from behind bow in hand crouching watchfully in a forest. Soon shes swept up in an ironic celebration. Having survived and prevailed in the previous years games Katniss and her friend Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) must criss-cross their wretched nation of Panem by train on a victory tour. When one of her handlers tells her to enjoy the experience because shes earned it Katniss replies ""Yes by killing people."" She speaks as a person of conscience struggling to be her authentic self yet forced to be a government symbol and to pretend for purposes of feel-good publicity that she and Peeta are madly in love rather than the rebels theyve become. And killing more people is what she must do in an ever more lethal round of games played out in a rain forest where the weather swings between bad and worse and poison fogs blister exposed skin. All of this is potent stuff and much more so for the absence of frenzy that infected the first film. The director and his colleagues havent dialed down the intensity or the lurid humor. Rather theyve staged their big set pieces with well-founded confidence that the material will speak for itself. The Capitol proves that resplendent and tawdry can co-exist in the same city. Stanley Tucci is funnier than ever as the game-show host Caesar Flickerman teeth and eyes gleaming madly from a skinscape of bottled tan. Donald Sutherlands President Snow is at least as suave as before and even more evil. Elizabeth Banks as the heroines grotesquely costumed escort Effie Trinket gets to show Effies human side however briefly. Philip Seymour Hoffman as the new gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee takes treachery to intriguing levels of complexity. And in the wardrobe department a drop-dead gorgeous gown worn by Katniss suddenly morphs into something no less gorgeous and vividly symbolic in the bargain. Yet none of it would work--not the action the adventure the political subtext or the humor--without the strength and beauty that Ms. Lawrence brings to the central role. Whenever shes on screen the camera studies the contours of her face with a gaze that might be fawning in other circumstances but seems properly attentive here. The lovely simplicity of her technique might have gratified James Cagney whose reputed advice to actors was ""Learn your lines find your mark look em in the eye and tell em the truth."" Its hard to believe how far this young star has come in the three years since her breakout role in ""Winters Bone"" but shes an archer in her own right. Everything she does flies straight and true. Watch a clip from ""Philomena"" starring Judi Dench as a woman who works with a journalist (Steve Coogan) to find the child she gave up for adoption years earlier. (Photo/Video The Weinstein Company) Philomena Even though the plot of ""Philomena"" follows a familiar pattern this drama of a woman searching for the son who was taken from her half a century ago can catch you by surprise. Thats a tribute to the storys essence its invisible skein of emotional connections but also to the eloquently understated performance of Judi Dench in the title role. ENLARGE Judi Dench and Steve Coogan star in Philomena Weinstein Co. Philomena Lee the retired working-class Irish nurse whose life inspired the film had become pregnant out of wedlock in the early 1950s when she was in her teens. Banished by her family to a convent in County Tipperary she gave birth then went to work in the convents laundry where she and other girls with similar histories were treated as slave laborers. She was allowed to see her son Anthony for one hour a day during the first three years of his life after which the boy was removed against her will and sold to American parents for adoption. In real life as in the movie which was directed by Stephen Frears Philomenas trials came to the attention of an ex-BBC reporter and former spin doctor named Martin Sixsmith. Hes played by Steve Coogan who with Jeff Pope based the screenplay on Mr. Sixsmiths book. Martin and Philomena make an odd couple--hes a world-weary sophisticate shes a sweet old provincial with a remarkable memory for the potboilers she loves to read and to recount at exhaustive length. The oddness is fine and so is the storys opening up when Philomena accompanied by Martin extends her search to America. But Mr. Coogan lavishly talented as a comic and a comic actor is fairly monotonous in the mostly serious role he wrote for himself. That leaves Ms. Dench to carry the picture which she does up to a point with her usual delicacy and grace.You cant help but be moved by the depth of Philomenas devotion to the memory of her son or by the doggedness of her refusal as a good Catholic to blame the sisters of the convent for what turned out to be the systematic sale of children for adoption; the going price for a baby at that time was about PS1000. But the picture outspoken through Martins mouth on the subject of the Churchs sins neglects to say that abuses of young women werent confined at the time to a single convent--the Magdalene Asylums combined reformatories and commercial laundries as late as the 1990s--and that some Protestant-run institutions were guilty of the same appalling practices. With ample blame to go around a piece of fiction comes up short on facts. Watch a clip from the film ""Approved for Adoption."" Comic-book artist Jung returns to Seoul for the first time since he was abandoned at the age of five. (Photo/Video GKIDS) Approved for Adoption Superb films can be anything they want to be. This exploration of adoption takes the unlikely form of an animated memoir with evocative segments of home movies complementing the sepia-toned drawings. In French with excellent subtitles its the work of Jung Henin--an illustrator and graphic novelist known professionally as Jung--and his co-director Laurent Boileau. Born in South Korea in 1965 Mr. Jung was sent as a young boy to Belgium where he says in the film adopting Korean children had become chic. The family that adopted him had four children of their own so an easy entry into a new Belgian life was never in the cards. When his adoptive mother tells him hes a bad apple he visualizes himself as such an apple with all the dark imagination at his command. ENLARGE A scene from Approved for Adoption GKids Visualizations are Mr. Jungs province and theyre what make his movie so deeply moving as well as literally illuminating. (Its a linguistic coincidence of course but his most powerful drawings are classically Jungian.) Using the heightened reality of animation--of unusually expressive animation--hes able to get at the inner turmoil so often experienced by adoptees the existential question of identity; the uneasy idealization of unknown biological parents (the ethereal mother in Jungs drawings lacks a face); the yearning for acceptance and failing that or indeed along with that the search for specific information about ones past. Its troubling to see Mr. Jungs slim dossier which raises more questions than it answers and haunting to see those home movies of the hero as a flesh-and-blood child. ""Approved for Adoption"" is tough and tender a rich resource for anyone who has been adopted and anyone who plans to adopt. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download ENLARGE Winters Bone (2010) The start of the phenomenon that has become Jennifer Lawrences career. The setting is the Ozark mountains of southwestern Missouri at the present time though many of the faces might have been photographed by Dorothea Lange or Mathew Brady and the themes are timeless--love kinship the struggle to survive. The 17-year-old heroine Ree Dolly is played by Ms. Lawrence whom I described when the movie opened as a professional actress who doesnt seem to act so much as achieve a state of grace that combines intelligence with fierce resolve. ENLARGE The Trip (2010) Steve Coogan and Rob Bryden riff on celebrity voices while playing approximate versions of their real--their surreal--selves. The pretext for this cheerful nonsense is a newspaper assignment to review upscale country restaurants in Englands Lake District and Yorkshire Dales. Both men brilliant mimics do Sean Connery Pierce Brosnan and Roger Moore as James Bond plus Woody Allen Ian McKellen and Alec Guinness. Most deliciously even bewitchingly they whisper sweet Michael Caines to each other doting on subtle deviations in timbre volume and pitch. All that and scallops too. Michael Winterbottom directed. ENLARGE The Magdalene Sisters (2002) Peter Mullans fiction film purportedly based on fact seems straight out of the 19th century. But the time is the 1960s when Irish girls are still being incarcerated in Magdalene Asylums run by the Catholic Church where inmates are forced to work long hours in commercial laundries under appalling conditions. Mr. Mullan evokes a nightmare world of sadistic nuns and predatory priests a world in which religious tenets have been twisted into pitiless tyranny. The cast includes Nora-Jane Noone as a headstrong beauty and Dorothy Duffy as a girl giving birth out of wedlock.

Smiles fortunately are also in the mix.The tale of a cynical journalist who helps an elderly woman learn what happened to the young son who was taken away from her is compelling poignant and gently funny. Steve Coogan co-wrote the script with Jeff Pope and also plays the journalist.Judi Dench brings the Irish-born Philomena to life with good humor and dignity. Its a wonderfully memorable performance by one of the acting worlds greats.Philomena reaches her sunset years needing to unburden herself of a secret thats been consuming her for half a century.REVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersHOLIDAY MOVIE CALENDAR NovemberShe had never told the family she later had about the son she gave birth to at 16 and the three years she spent with him in a strict Catholic convent. Forced to give him up for adoption she has never gotten over the loss. Privately Philomena has visited the Irish convent inquiring about the sweet boy she named Anthony. She was treated with patronizing courtesy offered tea but no empathy--and zero information.After she tearfully spills her story to her adult daughter on what would be Anthonys 50th birthday her daughter connects Philomena with former BBC journalist Martin Sixsmith (Coogan). The reporter initially resists what he dismisses as a human interest feature. Hes a political reporter. But drawn by her sad tale he spends five years helping Philomena search for her son sorting through a tangled web of secrets and hidden truths.Director Stephen Frears compassionately chronicles an emotional personal odyssey and intelligently explores a larger socio-cultural issue. The shame that the Catholic Church imposed on unwed mothers is made palpable. The church in Ireland is also exposed for profiting from the adoptions of these babies.Only a few plot holes keep the film from greatness. Coogan and Pope tidily adapted the script from Sixsmiths 2009 book adding a road trip in which Philomena and Martin travel to the United States. Thats where the most shattering revelations emerge but its also where the film trips up somewhat.Philomenas son was adopted along with Mary a little girl who was his beloved best pal as a toddler. When Philomena encounters Mary (Mare Winningham) as an adult the film seems to have left some crucial dialogue--or perhaps an emotional scene -- on the cutting-room floor. Weve come to know the good-natured chatty Philomena and her reaction upon seeing Mary after five decades is uncharacteristically muted.Otherwise the story is fascinating and the performances are convincing with charming chemistry between Coogan and Dench. Philomena is still a devout woman despite her cruel treatment from severe Irish nuns as a young girl (sensitively played in flashbacks by Sophie Kennedy Clarke). She was bound in a kind of indentured servitude at the convent -- three years of labor in the convent laundry in exchange for the medical care she and her young son received.Philomena Lees cheery strength and quiet determination is deeply moving. She will not be made into a victim nor does she lose her abiding faith. Philomena makes a winning holiday movie embodying the ideals of what the season is truly about forgiveness kindness and goodwill toward ones fellow man. 93 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/I6nXRMHoliday Movies Calendar NovemberTake a look at the films heading to the box office this November complete with trailers reviews previews and more.

"Review Judi Dench brings out the best in Philomena - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Judi Dench brings out the best in Philomena ""Philomena"" Alex Bailey / The Weinstein Co. Judi Dench and Steve Coogan star in ""Philomena."" Judi Dench and Steve Coogan star in ""Philomena."" (Alex Bailey / The Weinstein Co.) Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic On the job for 55 years Judi Dench elevates everything she does from M in the James Bond epics to the less intimidating but equally determined ""little old Irish lady"" whos the title character in ""Philomena."" Dench is not the only reason to see this unapologetic crowd-pleaser but she is the best one.As directed by the veteran Stephen Frears ""Philomenas"" ""inspired by true events"" narrative initially has trouble deciding what kind of film it wants to be alternating between cheeky comedy and the more serious emotional moments inherent in the story of a woman looking for a child she was forced to give away in adoption. Though it ends up the least involving part of the film ""Philomena"" does come by its comedy honestly. Costar Steve Coogan one of Britains top comics is not only Denchs costar he is also one of the films producers (and co-writer with Jeff Pope) and his presence mandated a certain amount of mostly indifferent humor that gets the film off to an unsteady start. (The films PG-13 rating in part for language is much more appropriate than its original R.)PHOTOS Movie Sneaks 2013 But as ""Philomena"" gets deeper into its involving plot it seems to gain confidence in the strength of its narrative and accepts the fact that telling a dramatic story is Job One.While one can wish that some of the storytelling were less on the nose the films overall effectiveness is hard to deny.A good part of the credit for this goes to Denchs performance as Philomena Lee -- Phil for short a retired nurse with quite a story to tell. It is the genius of the actress work that by bringing an instinctive dignity to her characterization she creates someone who is simultaneously average and extraordinary.Dench is especially effective in Philomenas reveries fleeting moments of memory and repose when the most delicate of looks pass across her face. It was co-writer Coogan in fact who discovered the films narrative lurking behind an incendiary headline in the Manchester Guardian ""The Catholic Church Sold My Child.""That led him to a nonfiction book by Martin Sixsmith that told Philomenas story in detail.Though Sixsmith is not a character in his own book as played by Coogan he has been drafted into the film as co-protagonist. In fact ""Philomena"" begins with Sixsmiths predicament Formerly a BBC foreign correspondent he was employed as director of communications for Tony Blairs government when something he did -- the film is murky on exactly what -- got him fired.Desperate for something to do he is approached by Philomenas daughter Jane (Anna Maxwell Martin) about her mothers story but Sixsmith is initially dismissive. He considers human interest stories to be journalism written about and for ""weak-minded ignorant people."" Full stop.PHOTOS Behind the scenes of movies and TVObviously (there wouldnt be a film otherwise) Sixsmith has a change of heart and agrees to investigate Philomenas story. It is one of the films drawbacks however that this film is as much about the getting of wisdom for him as it is about the getting of information for Phil.Thats a problem because this humanizing of a cynical emotionally disconnected twit into someone who recognizes the wisdom in a person of the lower classes is as much of a cliche as it sounds. ""Philomena"" does get some mileage out of specifically British class references -- there are jokes about Ryan Air and the Vauxhall Cavalier family car -- but Sixsmith never rises above the level of dramatic construct while Philomena becomes meaningful and real.The reason for that aside from Denchs acting is the strength of her story which has parallels to the tales told in Peter Mullans considerably more savage 2002 feature ""The Magdalene Sisters."" Finding herself pregnant and out of wedlock as an Irish teenager in 1952 Philomena takes the only refuge thats open to her and is handed over to the nuns at the Sacred Heart Convent in Roscrea. (Sophie Kennedy Clark is effective as the young Philomena in the films extensive flashbacks.)These nuns especially the hard-core Sister Hildegarde (played young by Kate Fleetwood and old by Barbara Jefford) really crack the whip. Philomena wracked by guilt as she is does daily backbreaking work in the laundry and is allowed to see her young son only one hour a day. She is coerced into letting her son be given away for adoption something that haunts her for a full half-century until she confesses to daughter Jane what happened and starts on the journey to find him.That story is the heart of ""Philomena"" and fortunately it is a truly surprising one filled with drama as well as several unexpected twists. ""Philomenas"" setup does feel conventional but Dench makes the resolution worth waiting for.kenneth.turanlatimes.com--------------------PhilomenaMPAA rating PG-13 for some strong language thematic elements and sexual referencesRunning time 1 hour 37 minutesPlaying In limited release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Steve Coogan Human Interest Reviews PG-13 Rated Movies Tony Blair Celebrity portraits by The Times Philomena Lee discusses search for her son and seeing Judi Dench portray her Weinstein Co. wins MPAA appeal to overturn R-rating for Philomena Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad76deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-philomena-20131122,0,2105248.story",200,philomena26,philomena,latimes

Photo The Weinstein Company MOVIE REVIEW Philomena Preaches to the choir. Running time 97 minutes. Rated PG-13 (profanity sexual situations). At the Paris and the Sunshine. With ""Philomena"" British producer-writer-star Steve Coogan and director Stephen Frears hit double blackjack finding a true-life tale that would enable them to simultaneously attack Catholics and Republicans. Theres no other purpose to the movie so if 90 minutes of organized hate brings you joy go and buy your ticket now. For the rest of us the film is a witless bore about a ninny and a jerk having one of those dire heavily staged only-in-movies odd-couple road trips. Coogan plays Martin Sixsmith a disgraced ex-government flack journalist and pompous intellectual who after getting fired learns at a party about a human-interest story that might jump-start his career. Its the woeful tale of Philomena Lee (Judi Dench) a woman of about 70 who 50 years ago in Catholic Ireland gave up for adoption a son born out of wedlock. Frears (the director of ""The Queen"") and Coogan revel in the details. When Lee then 18 started to gain weight after a sweet evening with a boy at a carnival she didnt even know the term ""pregnant."" She was sent off to an abbey to give birth in secrecy and shame with the son at age 3 given up for adoption. The film cant quite decide whether the young mother was forced to give up her son Anthony; it makes as look as though she was but also includes a scene in which contemporary Philomena adamantly denies coercion. The film doesnt mention that in 1952 Ireland both mother and childs life would have been utterly ruined by an out-of-wedlock birth and that the nuns are actually giving both a chance at a fresh start that both indeed in real life enjoyed. No this is a diabolical-Catholics film straight up. But with a chaser Martin and Philomena go on a seemingly pointless road trip to Washington DC to discover the fate of poor Anthony who was adopted by Americans became a prominent Republican and supposedly became a walking lesson about the horrors of the GOP. Philomena spends the movie saying dumb stuff (at the Lincoln Memorial ""Ive always wanted to see him in his big chair"") Martin is rude and dismissive and were meant to laugh I guess at her being a rube and his being a journalist. You may be wondering why Coogan felt the need to play a cold and unpleasant a figure who isnt (like many other Coogan creations) funny but the answer is simple Coogan hates journalists. A film that is half as harsh on Judaism or Islam of course wouldnt be made in the first place but would be universally reviled if it were. ""Philomena"" is a sucker punch or maybe a sugary slice of arsenic cake.

(Alex Bailey) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday November 21 2013 1200 PM Title Philomena Film Info With Judi Dench Steve Coogan. An elderly woman asks a journalist to find her lost son. Director Stephen Frears (138). PG-13 Language. Sunshine Paris. In adapting the true story of Philomena Lee Stephen Frears had two choices. He could treat this biopic as an expose emphasizing the brutal inhumanity of his subject matter. Or he could approach it like a human interest story softening the dark undertones with crowd-pleasing sentimentality. The former might have made for a stronger movie but the latter was bound to attract many more viewers. Guess which one he chose? The Stephen Frears of old -- the one who directed ""Prick Up Your Ears"" or ""The Grifters"" -- might have given us the edgier vision this subject matter really deserves. But while Frears has become comfortable with compromise hes still wise enough to offset things with character. The films backbone -- imagine a steel rod painted pink -- is Philomena herself played to perfection by Judi Dench. After 50 years Philomena has finally come to terms with her lifes secret. As a pregnant Irish-Catholic teen she was pushed into a convent where the sisters coldly gave her child away and forced her to toil in penance. Recently disgraced journalist Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan) hears of her story but hes reluctant to get involved. Hes a skeptical atheist with no time for a chatty old woman who reads romance novels and goes to confession faithfully. Judi Dench and Steve Coogan will arrive at a shocking discovery in Philomena. (Alex Bailey) Still he needs a paycheck. So when she asks him to find her long-lost son they fly from England to America on a tenuous lead. Both are stunned by what they discover. You may be shocked as well. The history of Irelands Magdalene girls as ""fallen"" young women imprisoned in convents were called is heartbreaking. Frears takes pains to soften the impact of such cruelty offsetting every critical observation with an empathic one. Martin and Philomena articulate this balance literally He questions religion she defends it. He demands outrage she expresses forgiveness. The movie wouldnt stand for much of anything without such an effective team to represent the equivocating. Best known for his comic roles Coogan (""The Trip"") is a gifted actor whos been striving valiantly but somewhat in vain to be taken seriously. Dench of course is an Oscar-winning Dame who rarely gets to show off her delightful sense of humor. The way these two talents connect -- and strengthen Frears tenuous tone -- is enough to soften any cynics heart. eweitzmannydailynews.com On a mobile device? Click here to watch the movie trailer.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Stephen Frears belongs to a longstanding British tradition of protean film stage and TV directing. He is a ""service entrance"" director who foregrounds script and performance; the quality of his work completely depends on the material and cast. Philomena marks his first collaboration with Steve Coogan whos worked extensively with Frears like-minded (though more adventurous) contemporary Michael Winterbottom. Adapted by Coogan and Jeff Pope from the 2009 non-fiction book The Lost Child Of Philomena Lee the moviestars Judi Dench as the title character a retired Irish nurse who is trying to find the son she gave up for adoption 50 years earlier. Dench inhabits the role. Her ""Phil"" is flinty but guileless. She recites the plots of her favorite romance novels to anyone within earshot but doesnt hesitate to call someone a ""feckin idiot"" when they deserve it. Martin Sixsmith (Coogan) the author of The Lost Child Of Philomena Lee acts as her foil. A former Labour Party spin-doctor angling to get back into journalism he pitches Phils story to a magazine editor as an article about ""evil nuns."" (Phil an unwed mother gave birth in a Catholic convent and then spent four years in its workhouse.) What Martin finds is far from a straightforward human interest story; it involves covered-up deaths the Catholic Church destroyed documents a for-profit adoption ring gay rights the Reagan administration and actress Jane Russell. Playing prickly insensitive media figures is Coogans specialty and the film pitches Phil and Martin as a couple of mismatched social blunderers; his faux pas tend to be snobbish (acting dismissive snapping at waitresses) while hers are naive. But for all of its road-movie character comedy Philomena is essentially about how a person reconciles their faith with an organized religions misdeeds with Phil as the Catholic-in-crisis and Martin as her atheist observer. This is where the movie finds its most moving moments (accompanied invariably by Alexandre Desplats twinkly score) and also where it takes its biggest stumbles. Conveying the nuances and contradictions of faith is tricky and Coogan and Popes script (and by extension Frears directing) is much better at handling Phils values than the nuns hypocrisy. The movies use of flashbacks tends to be heavy-handed and Frears decision to shoot them in grainy Super 16mm often gives them an unintentional exploitation-movie flavor; it also has the effect of making the rest of the movie shot in a digital palette of browns and green-grays look flat.  Still that doesnt detract too much from what Philomena manages to accomplish a sober consideration of how ideals relate to institutions--whether theyre religions or political parties--anchored by two well-rounded funny lead performances.

(Alex Bailey) A- Philomena Genre Drama; Starring Steve Coogan Judi Dench Charlie Murphy; Director Stephen Frears; Release Date Limited 11/27/2013; Runtime (in minutes) 98; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor The Weinstein Company Posted November 26 2013 -- 1200 AM EST Steve Coogan can be a difficult actor to love. Sarcastic and arch the British comic often goes down as bitterly as a cup of hemlock. But in Stephen Frears beautifully affecting Philomena he dares to leaven his cynical humor with humanity. Based on the tragic true story of an elderly Irishwoman who enlists the help of a jaded former journalist to track down the son she was forced to give up for adoption 50 years earlier Philomena feels like the kind of artisanally crafted prestige picture Miramax turned into a house style in the 90s. Build it and Oscars will come. Judi Dench of course is no stranger to that genre. And shes note-perfect here as Philomena Lee -- a woman who grew up in a convent and helplessly watched as her baby was sold to an American couple. The devout Catholic told herself that the shame and agony of that separation was the price of her youthful sin. But its a penance shes never made peace with. Coogans Martin Sixsmith is the erstwhile BBC reporter whos just been fired from his government job and reluctantly agrees to help Philomena less out of kindness than because the quest will make a sizzling sellable newspaper story. The class differences between the old biddy who devours bodice-ripping novels and the T.S. Eliot-quoting Oxford atheist are laid on a bit thick. But Dench and Coogans chemistry is undeniably great. In the end he manages to give her the answers she seeks and she manages to give him a heart.

Philomena is not only my favorite film of 2013 but one of the most eloquent powerful and perfect movies I have ever seen. A focused and triumphant performance by the miraculous Judi Dench keeps the harrowing aspects of a great story in flawless balance and every other aspect of this film works like a hypnotic charm. Sensitively and carefully directed by Stephen Frears and brilliantly written by co-star Steve Coogan and Jeff Pope its a once-in-a-lifetime experience that deserves genuflection. Ms. Dench gives a wrenching and deeply touching performance of feeling wisdom and nuance without a trace of sentimental self-indulgence in the title role of Philomena Lee a survivor of the despicable Irish Catholic asylums loosely called convents operated by Magdalene nuns in the 1960s to punish wayward girls the church considered ""sinners"" many of whom were unwed mothers shut away by their families to hide their shame. The dehumanizing emotional and sadistic physical abuse they suffered as victims of moral rectitude were chronicled in the lavishly praised 2002 film The Magdalene Sisters. This is about one of those victims a spirited broth of a woman who spent 50 years searching for the son she was forced to give up for adoption without consent. After decades of fruitless prayers a chance meeting at a party brings Philomenas grown daughter a waitress in contact with Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan) a disgraced political aide to Prime Minister Tony Blair now making a comeback as a journalist for the BBC. Ambivalent at first he agrees to meet Philomena and her arresting honesty and unpretentious wit intrigues him. The more he researches her story the more intrigued he becomes by what became of Philomenas child. A paper chase leads to America and shocking revelations in Washington D.C. For anyone who laments the death of compelling stories in the wake of all the gibberish that passes itself off as filmmaking today Philomena will revive your faith in movies. Like an overpowering novel you cannot put down this gripping real-life story allows you to share the journey step by step as Philomena who still clings to her faith and Martin a lapsed Catholic and devoted atheist leave no rock unturned in their search for answers. After the long trip to the old convent where the young Philomena endured so much horror the remaining nuns are still hard and unrepentant telling her the records were destroyed in a fire. But they have a gift shop where they sell souvenirs for a profit and a cemetery where so many of the former girls and their nameless babies are buried. (Its a graveyard that plays a big role in solving Philomenas mystery.) With her batteries newly recharged the sweet unsophisticated Irish woman named Philomena is beginning to see the light. The more she delves the more she discovers about her lost child and herself. The convent sold a lot of babies to wealthy American customers. One of them was Hollywood star Jane Russell. I wont spoil a film beyond reproach by revealing what Philomena finds out about her own little boy but the facts that tumble out are as turbulent as they are startling. After all the clues are pieced together the final explanation of what happened to the child--and the look on her face when she learns the truth--will tear your hear out. Meanwhile the cynical reporter and the innocent religious naif saved by unquenchable hope and indomitable spirit form an unlikely bond that leaves out no funny detail of their own mismatched friendship. Steve Coogans writing is a major revelation bringing to life Martin Sixsmiths 2009 book The Lost Child of Philomena Lee with great humanity and insight. Hes a great foil for the star the salt in her stew. As for Ms. Dench the beauty of her spectacular moment-to-moment performance will leave you hanging on the ropes. One of the heroic masters of the craft and artistry of acting she melts you with her radiance. Mr. Frears a wonderful director of actors is careful to give her enough adequate space to feel her way around in. Whether she sheds a tear for other peoples pain or drives you crazy with her habit of repeating the endings of romance novels (""I didnt see that one coming"" is one of her favorite lines) she is so natural understated and generous that you are never aware theres a camera in the room. Its profoundly moving and thoroughly mind provoking but despite the poignant subject matter I promise you will not leave Philomena depressed.

Developed and coscripted by the star himself Stephen Frearss absorbingly complex latest takes the journalistic urgency of The Queen and adds a feisty layer of religious sparring something you wont find in American films. The combatants are Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan) the real-life ex-BBCer looking for a comeback and Philomena Lee (Dench chocolate over iron) the devout mum at the center of his human-interest story. They seek her long-lost son taken from her as an orphan while she toiled--unwed and disowned--in an abbey. A trip to America bears its share of exasperated hotel-room humor but watch both actors lean into characters seeking redemption; their clash is invigorating with a mature payoff that has two minds meeting and getting further along. Its a tonic to all the Oscar-season showboating Call it Best Duo.

The great sins of the 20th century are already too many to list but let us note one more the abduction of infants from mothers deemed unworthy or undesirable by governments and religious institutions. Thousands of children were kidnapped from leftist parents during Argentinas and Spains respective dictatorships while children born to native populations in Australia and the United States now constitute ""stolen generations."" A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Based on actual events Stephen Frearss Philomena adds another country to that list Ireland where the Catholic Church carried out the wholesale theft and trade of children born to unwed mothers. This affecting impressively intelligent drama follows one elderly womans search for her biological son who was sold without her permission five decades earlier to a rich woman who pets the boy as she might a cat.Given that grim premise Philomena is remarkably funny with stars Judi Dench and Steve Coogan amiably sharing the comic spotlight. Coogan plays Martin a Labour party aide to the Blair administration who gets sacked for describing 9/11 as ""a good day to bury bad news."" He slums it for a while as a journalist and eventually meets Philomena (Dench) who has kept silent about her stolen firstborn Tony until now. Already reluctant to speak ill of the Church she bristles when Martin tries to pigeonhole her into victimhood. Rightly wary of the reporter Philomena agrees to have her story told on the condition that Martin help her find Tony.Film Details Philomena RatingPG-13 GenreDrama Running Time94 More Info An angry atheist and a civilized churl Martin rolls his eyes at the constancy of Philomenas faith and her pedestrian tastes. ""Ive always thought Christopher was a bit of a Mickey Mouse saint"" he tells her when she hangs a medallion of the holy man from his cars rearview mirror. ""I now know what a lifetime of the Daily Mail and Readers Digest and romantic fiction does to someones brain"" he later reports to his wife.With her Edith Bunker haircut and granny glasses Philomena might well be in the same sewing circle as the ""bigoted woman"" who asked Gordon Brown where all the immigrants were suddenly coming from. But as the film progresses it becomes clear that ""Phil"" sits on a stockpile of wisdom -- she just chooses to squirrel it away for a rainy day. Intelligence ebbs and flows in Denchs eyes depending on how clever Philomena chooses to be in a given situation. Needless to say the grande dames performance alternately goofy and grave is an absolute tour de force.Since the films structure is based on a series of revelations -- each one unexpected and unfailingly moving -- they shouldnt be recounted here. But it gives away nothing to say that their long trip together provides plenty of opportunities for the two characters to passionately debate religion and journalistic ethics while the friction between their worldviews offers silent commentary on the perniciousness of British class inequality. Frears indulges in a couple of cutesy touches but he handles the frequent tonal shifts between tragedy and comedy with masterful sensitivity and timing.""After the sex I thought anything so lovely must be wrong"" the vulnerable but unflappable Philomena confesses about her first time lowering her head in pensive regret. Her slow journey toward finally feeling worthy enough to hold her head high is surprising upsetting and not to be missed.

One of the significant new releases coming out this week deals with the plight of an innocent woman fighting against the restrictions of a society that has forced her to reckon with terrible circumstances. Many moviegoers undoubtedly associate this description with ""The Hunger Games Catching Fire"" the latest blockbuster adaptation of Suzanne Collins young adult science-fiction series in which Jennifer Lawrence plays an impromptu warrior forced to battle her peers in a dystopian civilization. However its not only new adaptation to delve into the aforementioned subject matter In ""Philomena"" (which opens in limited release Friday) director Stephen Frears chronicle of journalist Martin Sixsmiths experience writing the non-fiction tome ""The Lost Child of Philomena Lee"" Steve Coogan portrays Sixsmith as he uncovers the history of a woman separated from her child at an Irish convent in the 1950s. There are no fights to the death in this tender story. Judi Dench portrays the guilt-ridden Philomena who is haunted by the mystery of her sons fate for decades and finally is willing to speak out about it. Nevertheless Philomenas courage to re-engage with the religious institution that deprived her of her offspring provides a realist alternative to the bloody exploits of ""Catching Fire"" star Katniss Everdeen. On the surface ""Catching Fire"" and ""Philomena"" exist on two wildly different planes. But when considered in light of their similar themes the connection hints at the way compelling ideas can travel through vastly different forms of storytelling. Co-written by Coogan and Jeff Pope the script for ""Philomena"" starts at a point where both lead characters have accepted their frustrating circumstances. Sixsmith once a successful BBC journalist before shifting into politics was forced to resign after a private gaffe went public. Early scenes find him comically attempting to assert his intellect even as he has too much time on his hands. He tries jogging and contemplates writing a book on Russian literature but initially wont consider investigating Philomenas plight when her daughter approaches him about it turning up his nose at the prospects of a human-interest story. Eventually however hes drawn to Philomenas soft-spoken manner and solemn gaze. Shes similarly at war with herself first seen coming clean to her daughter about her lost half-brother on his 50th birthday and eventually ecstatic about the possibility of tracking him down in the United States. As the duo follows the clues to the upbringing her son received from American foster parents they eventually become aware of a complex network of events that preceded the onscreen circumstances to the point where ""Philomena"" eventually turns into a thoughtful treatise on the way the past has the power to dictate our actions and feelings in the present. As ""The Hunger Games"" franchise barrels forward it invokes similar ideas on an admittedly louder flashier scale. Much happened before Katniss (Lawrence) became the leading warrior of a twisted lethal competition that forces teens to kill each other and the series mythology gradually reveals how the dark scenario came together in the first place. The latest installment is an unquestionably tense return to the grim setting of the first movie with a fair share of slickly devised action sequences that raises the stakes with the prospects of a greater rebellion. But its also clearly one piece of a larger equation and inherently incomplete as a result -- the best moment arrives when it sets the stage for the next sequel. Still the ideas remain potent throughout Katniss and her fellow survivors are victims of a system assembled without their consent that bears down on them at every moment but all they can do is keep moving ahead. And thats also the case for Philomena a religious woman aware that her childs birth out of wedlock led to her situation even though she never rejected him. Frears movie capably finds a balance in her willingness to accept her circumstances while experiencing a deep-seated anger for a situation she can only resolve by confronting it head-on. Theres a reason for this unlikely connection. ""Catching Fire"" is unquestionably a Hollywood product that has been chiefly designed to rake in untold millions of dollars worldwide following in the path of its predecessor. ""Philomena"" is a potential Oscar contender directed by a respected British filmmaker. Yet both movies have garnered acclaim for achieving entertainment value while dealing with bleak situations. Their characters willingness to push forward against seemingly impossible odds results in engaging survival tales. The plight of the beleaguered hero has offered enticing possibilities ever since Homers ""The Odyssey"" so its no surprise that its particular incarnations in these new releases prove the scenario has timeless allure. However if one were to single out the movie that grapples best with sophisticated problems ""Philomena"" would have to win out. Its not a ""Hunger Games""-level competition here but ""Catching Fire"" thrills more than it provokes and ""Philomena"" remains pensive throughout. Of course theyre blatantly pitched at audiences with different sensibilities. But no matter which one you choose to see youre bound to have a lot to debate afterward. So why not make it a double bill?

Brutal Out of the Furnace Leaves AFI Fest Jubilant But Shell-Shocked August Osage County Review Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts Go at It Like Godzilla vs. Megalon Saving Mr. Banks Opens AFI Fest With a Spoonful of Oscar Hopes Stephen Frears docudrama urges us to forgive the sinning Catholic Church which is one thing but why the condescension toward atheists and intellectuals? Theres a particularly smug and tut-tutting billboard currently making the rounds which reads ""To Our Atheist Friends Thank God Youre Wrong."" ""Philomena"" has a similar head-patting brand of dismissive arrogance which is doubly offensive given its theme of forgiveness against those who have done you wrong. If the movie wants to let the Catholic Church off the hook lightly for its crimes against unwed mothers in Ireland in the mid-20th century that is its right but why top that off with such a dismissive attitude toward non-believers? Thankfully Stephen Frears docudrama offers the one-two punch of Steve Coogan and Judi Dench and even if the film eventually forces a singular perspective on the material the actors chemistry absolves any number of narrative sins. See video Steve Coogan Helps Judi Dench Find Her Long-Lost Son in Philomena Trailer As a teenage girl in the 1950s Philomena Lee (played as an adolescent by Sophie Kennedy Clark) has her head turned by a handsome young man she meets at a carnival. When she became pregnant her embarrassed family left her at a convent where girls were scolded for their sins forced to undergo painful labor (as expiation for their wrongdoing) and then work in the convent laundry to pay back the cost of their keeping. (This practice was previously examined in the decidedly bleaker 2002 film ""The Magdalene Sisters."") The children who survived were sold off to American families (according to ""Philomena"" ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"" star Jane Russell was a customer) and the young women signed away their right to keep or ever receive information about their children. Also read Inside Llewyn Davis Review Dark Coen Brothers Comedy Puts the Hoot in Hootenanny On the 50th anniversary of her sons birth the elderly Philomena (Dench) breaks her silence and decides to try to track down the child she has thought about every day for the last five decades. The convent proves unhelpful so her daughter seeks the assistance of disgraced former government mouthpiece Martin Sixsmith (Coogan); he is at first uninterested but then realizes that this is the kind of heart-tugging human interest story to kick-start his new career as a journalist. (Coogan and Jeff Popes screenplay is based on Sixsmiths book ""The Lost Child of Philomena Lee."") Philomena and Martin butt up against numerous bureaucratic and personal impediments but between his dogged tactlessness and her sweet-old-lady demeanor they are finally able to piece together the mystery. As the depths of betrayal committed by the church become clearer Martin grows angrier while Philomena finds within herself the capacity to forgive. The film fares best when tracking this duos travels from Ireland to the United States and back again as Martin goes from being irritated to charmed by Philomenas inherent kindness to strangers and her love of mainstream romance novels. These extraordinary actors make an eminently watchable odd couple. Also read Mandela Long Walk to Freedom Review Idris Elba Finds Icons Humanity in This Moving Stolid Biopic Where ""Philomena"" gets problematic is in its insistence that the audience see Philomenas take on the world as ""right"" and Sixsmiths insider cynicism as ""wrong."" Cant they just be different? Does the films pedestal for Philomenas righteousness have to smother Sixsmiths differing viewpoint? Is this secretly a Tyler Perry movie? Biopics about the living can be tricky -- each one has its own minefield of keeping the subject happy -- and ""Philomena"" at least never soft-pedals the injustices visited upon its central character. Had the film stopped short of beatifying her however we might have a more satisfying drama. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

That is Ruskin describing the ideal approach to Venice in 1850. Fast-forward a century and a half and somehow despite everything the marvelling remains. Only a few minor details have changed. This week for instance the view from a vaporetto chugging by a hundred yards offshore was as follows reading from right to left one observed the Ducal Palace still blushing after all these years; the entrance to St Marks Square flanked by its twin pillars one lion-topped; the campanile as proud as a rocket on its pad; a flank of the Zecca once the home of the local mint; and stretched across it grander and greedier for worship than any altarpiece of the city James Franco. His image bedecked with shades and the perfect length of mini-beard adorns an advertisement for Gucci and first-time visitors to Venice could be forgiven for asking what venerable place he holds in the history of the Republic. Was this dude a doge or something? As far as the past fortnight is concerned the answer is yes. Franco has directed a movie ""Child of God"" which showed at the Venice Film Festival in competition--that is to say duking it out with nineteen other films for the honor of the Golden Lion. In a remarkable show of restraint Franco does not star in his own film though he does appear as a school soccer coach preying on the girls in his squad in ""Palo Alto"" also screening at Venice which was directed by Gia Coppola--how you might ask did she get a foot in the door?--and adapted from a book of short stories by James Franco. Basically the guy is everywhere. I was in a hotel bar last weekend when from the far end of the room came the rumble and buzz that signal the passing of a star. And lo there was Franco making solemn progress amid a host of minders hangers-on photographers and other orbital persons. I once saw Mahmoud Abbas traverse a lobby in Paris with half the entourage and a fraction of the fuss. Apotheosis came when Franco appeared formally clad at the premiere for ""Child of God"" complete with mirrored shades which allowed a few blessed members of the public to see themselves reflected in his glory. To be fair however rumors that his first name could be changed from ""James"" to ""Generalissimo"" were swiftly scotched. And what of his work? Well ""Child of God"" was adapted from Cormac McCarthy; Scott Haze plays Lester Ballard a lonely woodsman unsound of mind but good with a gun who is discarded by polite society. He finds the corpse of a young woman in a car takes it back to his shack and dresses it up in a nice red frock; from there events follow their unnatural course. If asked Lester would deride Norman Bates as a mere taxidermist with no real taste for adventure. Like a number of other films at Venice ""Child of God"" seems duty-bound to rub our noses in it--""it"" meaning many things some of them to do with bodily functions or malfunctions and all of them about as far from Ducal Palaces Gucci shades and the plash of gentle waves as you could hope to get. Nowhere is more adept than Venice at establishing a mood or--if only for a couple of hours--at breaking it. Does that speak of mischief or might there be a fleck of guilt involved--the conscience of a place that has hogged more than its fair share of radiance for over a thousand years and that feels the need to purge itself now and then with fragments of the seedy and the soiled? It could be simpler than that. After all we are talking about a film festival. There are people who go to movies and there are people who go to film festivals and the difference between them by and large is that only the latter are willing to line up for necrophilia at nine oclock in the morning. Not just willing but bright with larkish zeal getting there half an hour ahead of schedule so as to grab the best seat. Necrophilia being one of those things obviously that you dont want to spoil by watching from the wrong angle. Here is the deal according to Venice rules. Most films receive multiple screenings maybe four or five in the course of the festival and the earliest of these deliberately scheduled to wreck any civilized breakfast are for the press and also for ""industry"" meaning not panel-beaters and welders but those who slave in the mines of the movie business. Depending on your calling you find yourself herded into one particular file shuffling between metal guide-rails towards your destination. To me this always bears the faint but discernible flavor of a working abattoir and I would not be surprised to find a hit-squad of movie directors at the other end wearing bloody aprons and brandishing stun-guns for use on defenseless critics. Nothing less than we deserve of course. In some cases the air of threat survives in the auditorium. Half a dozen arenas are pressed into service for the Festival and I lost a big chunk of daylight last week in the Sala Darsena a chilly cavernous barn with a concrete floor seating more than twelve hundred souls. It could one imagines be transformed without ado into temporary housing for the victims of a major disaster so settling down to a James Franco movie felt like a relative relief though not by much. This was also the venue for ""Joe"" the strongest feature to date from David Gordon Green with a forthright performance from a grizzled Nicolas Cage and for ""Night Moves"" the new Kelly Reichardt film; the first delved into the rawest of Southern lives the second into the rarefied concerns of environmental activists but what linked them was the compulsion as climax neared to spend themselves in violence--laughably so in the latter case. Has that really become the template for all narrative conclusions not just in the mainstream but in the more traditionally placid confines of the arthouse? Or did it only seem that way because we were watching these displays of American anger and frustration in the Serenissima of all unlikely places? Venice floats at the other end of the spectrum devoting itself even now to easy living--to the belief that the senses should be gratified not chafed. Mind you the privilege does not come cheap. That may be why audiences whether in public or press screenings reacted with such warmth to ""Philomena"" the new Stephen Frears film. This tells of an elderly Irish woman (Judi Dench) who with the aid of a journalist (played by Steve Coogan who also co-wrote the script) tries to trace the son whom she was forced to give up for adoption fifty years ago. Elsewhere perhaps its steadiness might be construed as staidness and the confidence of its moral pursuit as a trifle smug; yet surrounded as it was by many films that veered towards self-importance or whose visual allure was badly scarred by poor writing Frearss work felt all the more welcome in its restraint. We prepared ourselves for an emotional explosion--not for physical violence but for that of a bursting heart--and yet when the time came that is not what happened. Frears put the pin back in the grenade as it were; when was the last time you experienced that in a cinema? ""Philomena"" sure left ""Kill Your Darlings"" in the shade. This purports to tell the tale of Allen Ginsberg Jack Kerouac and other youthful talents as they find themselves ensnared first in foolish student japes and then in darker deeds. One previous actor who played Ginsberg onscreen was it goes without saying James Franco in ""Howl."" How you view the new film will depend largely on whether you believe that a restless Jewish poet from New Jersey plunging into his first sexual spates both gay and straight at Columbia in the nineteen-forties should or should not be played by Daniel Radcliffe. It is wholly to his credit that he should solemnly seek to extend his range like this beyond the schoolboy exploits that made him famous; and it is absolutely not his fault that most people watching the result will have to clench their fists and stop themselves from crying out ""Oh my God Harry Potter and the Blowjob of Azkaban"" Only on a couple of occasions in the days that I spent in Venice did something witnessed in the dark inside an auditorium begin to rival the raptures that are so freely almost annoyingly doled out by Venice herself. And that is as it should be. There is something inherently comic about staging a movie festival in such a place; on what possible ground should you wish to see motion pictures when not far away there are pictures of the motionless variety and of a refulgence that has not dimmed for more than five hundred years? One answer perhaps is that the festival--now in its seventieth year--is required precisely as a rebuke to those of us who are tempted whenever we come here to lock ourselves into the past and throw away the key. I am not as stricken in this regard as Ruskin but then nobody is. He thought that the party was pretty much over by 1480 and that ""the Venice of modern fiction and drama is a thing of yesterday a mere efflorescence of decay a stage dream which the first ray of daylight must dissipate into dust."" But I am still a chronic case. Given the choice I would cheerfully spend my days--the rest of them in fact--ambling down the Riva degli Schiavoni towards where Henry James toiled on ""The Portrait of a Lady"" in the Pensione Wildner (""the view from my window was una bellezza"" he wrote); hanging a left walking for one minute entering the church of San Zaccaria and parking myself in front of the Virgin with Saints Peter Jerome Catherine and Lucy painted by Giovanni Bellini in 1505. I happen to find it the most beautiful painting in the world which makes it all the more essential to tear myself away retrace my steps to the waterfront step onto a vaporetto and go to see a George Clooney film--to drag myself back to the present if not in this case down to earth. ""Gravity"" was the opening night movie of this years Venice Film Festival and also as one producer said to me ""the best opening night movie of the past ten years."" That was because it satisfied all parties. In dramatic terms it was a cloistered chamber-piece demanding no more characters than a Beckett play and directed by Alfonso Cuaron who made ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" and ""Children of Men""; and yet it was also a generous offering of sci-fi--set in space shot in 3-D and liberally dusted with cataclysm and suspense. It was screened that night not in the lowly cattle-shed of the Sala Darsena but in the lusher surroundings of the Palazzo del Cinema and Clooney and his co-star Sandra Bullock borne thither in Maseratis did what the high priests of movies are meant to do--smile wave strike a sacred pose and then descend to greet their congregations. If you are a guest at such events you are always asked ""Did you get to meet the stars?"" Well yes but only in the sense that a birdwatcher crouched in a richly camouflaged hide with a full bladder and a packet of sandwiches gets to ""meet"" the spotted woodpecker a hundred yards away. In the case of ""Gravity"" we got to sit in the movie theatre long before the movie began and gawp at the big screen on which was projected real-time footage of Clooney and Bullock outside having photos of their own faces snapped by the iPhones of hyperventilating fans. Any postmodernists present will have wet themselves for joy. The only problem with the Venice Film Festival a relaxed smoothly-run and wide-ranging affair which takes place on the Lido in late August is that it takes place on the Lido in late August. No traveller in his or her right mind goes anywhere near Venice between the butt-end of May and mid-September unless you want to see a pitched battle between tourists and mosquitoes to see how many of them can be crammed into a square inch but then Venice has a wicked habit of nudging you out of your right mind into the wrong. As for the Lido give me strength. Why Robert Browning came here on a regular basis I have no idea. A long unlovely eel of land twenty-minutess boat-ride from San Zaccaria it is a terra desolata full of things called roads and cars and buses barely familiar to a Venetian and strewn with blocky modern buildings no good restaurants and no Bellinis. The reason that Thomas Mann called his 1912 novella ""Death in Venice"" rather than say ""Lunch in Venice"" or ""A nice cup of tea in Venice"" is because it was set on the Lido. Nonetheless it has long been fashionable although the hotel to which Mann dispatched his high-minded hero has now been shut for redevelopment. And nowhere in Venice itself could provide premises large enough for a film festival and so it is to the Lido that festival fans must make their pilgrimage. To me this time it meant a commute. Last year I took a hotel room on the Western strip of the Lido which meant opening the curtains every day and seeing Venice proper in the distance shimmering out of reach. By day three I began to sympathize with the throng of the dead beached on the bank of the underworld river in Book VI of the Aeneid who ""stretch their hands out in longing for the farther shore."" Unwilling to revisit my lament I stayed this year in town in the peace of the Dorsuduro beneath the lower curve of the Grand Canal and was ferried across as if by Charon to my morning film. An unusual routine but it made as much practical sense as taking the subway from say W. 96th St to Canal St to attend the Tribeca Film Festival although even I was struck by the oddness of the arrangement as I made my way to the premiere of ""Gravity""--cruising across a lagoon in a tuxedo just to see a movie. In case this sounds faintly glamorous I should add that I felt like and undoubtedly resembled a nervous croupier on the way to a job interview. At least the film was fun. ""Gravity"" was one of the peaks of the Festival. Some people liked Alex Gibneys ""The Armstrong Lie"" which told us more than we will ever need or want to know about Lance Armstrong and his cheatin heart; I preferred the revelations of a smaller documentary ""Bertolucci on Bertolucci"" directed by Luca Guadagnino and Walter Fasano. Bertolucci now in a wheelchair was the president of the jury at this years Festival and so it was all the more stirring to watch him--and his younger fervent selves--talk about the wellsprings of his art. With Armstrong the unburdening of truth at last seems to have led this clenched soul no closer towards self-knowledge whereas the inquiring candor of Bertolucci was such that it left you drained and gasping for a grappa as if you had just spent two hours perched at the elbow of a shrink. Then there was ""Under the Skin"" about which I will say little for now; partly because the film should be discussed at length when it comes out in the United States (no date has yet been set) but also because I remain like many of its characters drifting in the dark. The fact that Jonathan Glazers movie was met with both boos and applause merely illustrates its capacity to confound. All you need to know for the moment--and I was lucky enough to enter the auditorium knowing zilch having avoided all accounts of the film in the buildup--is that it stars Scarlett Johansson and that much of it unwinds in Glasgow and its environs. If you can understand the chewy local burr as I can you may have an advantage though not a sizeable one because dialogue here is not the governing force; it is your eyes that are held hostage as the screen slowly releases its astonishments drop by drop. Some viewers were reminded of ""The Man who Fell to Earth"" and I agree although with so much death and desire in the offing I also felt by the end as if I had sat through an unauthorized sequel to ""Orphee."" Last night the Venice Film Festival ended like a school term with the prize-giving. The Golden Lion went to a documentary ""Sacro GRA"" directed by Gianfranco Rosi about the road that girdles Rome; to my regret it had screened late in the festival after I had had to leave town. Let us pray that an American distributor honoring the choice of Bertolucci and his jury picks the movie up. Mind you awards seldom seem to encompass a festival let alone resolve it as they are designed to do; the actual sensation of being there always escapes the formalities. No prize however well-deserved can recapture the unceasing churn of films from day to day and the expectant chatter of festival-goers never quite sated who riffle through screenings like little boys in decades past collecting baseball cards ""Im seeing Joe at nine then the Schrader at eleven though I may see the Australian movie instead and keep the Schrader back until late tonight although that would clash with the Moodysson and then theres the German one about the policeman at four--have you seen that yet?--and Ill definitely catch you at the Reichardt later yeah screw dinner. ..."" Is it possible to watch a movie without actually seeing it let alone granting oneself the time or the restful space in ones head to think about what it might mean? It is also in the gift of juries to get things wrong. In 1953 the Venice jury issued no Golden Lion having decided that in all honesty nothing stood out in that years selection. I mean it only contained Fellinis ""I Vitelloni"" Sam Fullers ""Pickup on South Street"" and unbelievably Mizoguchis ""Ugetsu Monogatari."" The following year contenders included Mizoguchi again with ""Sansho the Bailiff"" and Fellini again with ""La Strada"" plus Viscontis ""Senso"" and ""On the Waterfront."" And none of them won either; instead the victor was ""Romeo and Juliet"" directed by Renato Castellani. Sometimes the Golden Lion has no claws. In 2013 to our delight we saw some of those earlier events. Before every major film the organizers in an inspired initiative screened short clips of newsreels from previous Festivals. No James Franco but by way of compensation Orson Welles marching into town with the most appropriate of Venetian films his 1952 version of ""Othello."" Or the year before that Vivien Leigh accepting a prize for Best Actress in ""A Streetcar Named Desire."" And so on from day to day; for a fortnight the projected cavalcade of dignitaries and half-remembered beauties unfolded before us like one of Carpaccios processions across Saint Marks Square. Once again the old trick was at work. The Venice of today was dwindling and vanishing into a multitude of far-gone yesterdays twice as splendid with an undiminished power to bewitch ""As soon as the sun set this part of the sea teemed with gondolas adorned with beautiful women and resounded with the varied harmony of voice and musical instruments which accompanied our delightful supper until midnight."" That is not September 2013 on the Lido in the company of Scarlett Johansson but the night of August 1 1543 and a dinner party given by Titian at his house near the Fondamenta Nuove on Venices northern side. A new harpsichord had been installed. Guests included Pietro Aretino--pamphleteer playwright pornographer poet and a good man to have on your side--and Jacopo Sansovino the architect without whom St Marks Square as we know it would scarcely exist. Four hundred and seventy summers later how can we compare? All we can do I guess is to steep ourselves afresh in Titians legacy starting with a foray to the Frari to pay homage before his ""Assumption"" of 1518 and to lose ourselves anew whenever we can in film or snatches of film--Clooney and Bullock for instance wheeling and waltzing on a spacewalk in a transport of bliss that even Titian would have struggled to imagine. Or better yet to pay attention to a newsreel crisply shot and unearthed for our consideration last week. The occasion is yet another Venice Film Festival with actors and directors garlanded at the close. The sunlight gleams. A water-taxi moves along the Grand Canal. And look Ecco Which global celebrity can it be on board hailing the crowds as he glides by relishing his eminent spot at the very heart of the Festival? Ah yes Joseph Goebbels in 1942. Not all history asks to be revisited. When a place becomes a dream too far you need to wake up fast. Photograph by Anthony Lane. Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe Venice Film Festival Philomena at Venice Reserve an Oscar for Judi Dench The British star shines in this true story of a woman searching for the son stolen from her a half-century ago By Mary Corliss Aug. 31 2013 Share Read Later Send to Kindle The Weinstein Company Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture The biggest thunderclap of cheers and applause heard in ages at the Venice Film Festival came halfway through the press screening of Stephen Frears Philomena when Steve Coogan as journalist Martin Sixsmith looks at Judi Dench as Philomena Lee and mutters ""F--ing Catholics."" Italy is both a Catholic country and a robustly anticlerical one but the whoops from the audience werent a reflex action to an ecclesiastical obscenity. They expressed a passionate connection to the films story ""inspired by true events"" of a woman looking for the son that the Church stole from her a half-century before. The thieves were Northern Irish nuns who ran a slave-labor home for unwed pregnant girls -- similar to the homes for ""fallen girls"" documented in The Magdalene Sisters which won the Golden Lion here in 2002. In Philomena the facility is called Roscrea; and two orders of nuns The Sisters of Mercy and The Little Sisters of the Poor are conflated with wicked wit into The Sisters of Little Mercy. But the particulars are sadly accurate. When the girls indentured to the convent for four years gave birth (with little or no medical help) they were allowed to see their babies only an hour a day. Wealthy couples often from the U.S. could adopt the children for 1000 and take them away without the young mothers being allowed to even say goodbye forever. Decades later when these women returned asking for aid in locating their children they were told all the documentation had been lost in a fire. (READ Richard Corlisss review of The Magdalene Sisters) Do let your blood boil at this sorry chapter in recent Church history exceeded in evil and venality only by the abuse of untold numbers of boys by Catholic priests. And then understand that Philomena for all the righteous anger it displays and incites is at heart a feel-good movie. It details the crusade of a cheerful woman Philomena who 50 years after her Roscrea ordeal hopes to find her son Anthony. ""Id like to know if he thought of me"" she tells Sixsmith. ""Ive thought of him every day."" Philomena is almost a comedy. Frears in fine form at 72 has proved himself a modest master at juggling the serious and the silly in such actors showcases as The Queen and Tamara Drewe; and the script by Coogan and Jeff Pope from Sixsmiths book The Lost Child of Philomena Lee brims with bright dialogue. With an itinerary ranging from London to Birr Ireland to various parts of the U.S. Philomena is also a kind of road movie in which two people separated by class and temperament learn to respect and embrace each others strengths and quirks. In that sense this is a cousin to Michael Winterbottoms TV series and feature film The Trip in which Coogan and Rob Brydon engage in dueling banter on a restaurant jaunt through the English Midlands. (READ Richard Corlisss review of The Trip) Sixsmith a BBC journalist who was cashiered from the Labour Government just before meeting Philomena is a graduate of Oxford (and Harvard and the Sorbonne) and an expert purveyor of deflating mots on any subject including his own atheism ""I dont believe in God and I think He can tell."" Martin is tipped to Philomenas quest by her daughter (Anna Maxwell Martin) a waitress and desperate for work pitches the idea to a broadsheet editor who sees its potential as a human-interest story. Martins problem he has no human interest. Hed rather be writing a book on Russian history than spending time with the chatty chummy Philomena whose taste in literature runs to romance novels whose plots she is happy to exhaustively relate to the exasperated Martin and when they travel to Washington D.C. on her lost sons trail is tempted to watch Big Mommas House on the hotel VOD rather than visit the Lincoln Memorial. Getting full comic effect from its class-comedy abrasions Philomena rises to poignancy and profundity as Dench reveals her control of a character stained by the loss of her child and troubled by her suspicion when she learns the name his American family gave him that ""He wasnt my Anthony. He was somebody elses Michael."" Yet despite Martins sage observation that ""Its the Catholic Church that should be going to confession not you"" Philomena has never lost her faith. As she lights a candle at church a priest asks if its for someone special and with her eyes gently tearing she whispers ""Yes."" (READ How Judi Dench Won the Summer Box Office) Coogan the comic who has played the shallow chat-host Alan Partridge on TV for nearly 20 years brings an agreeable sometimes awkward gravity to Martin. Sophie Kennedy Clark rings all notes of helplessness and holy fury as the young Philomena. But this is Denchs triumph. At 78 she has a golden career behind her often as queens (Mrs Brown Shakespeare in Love) and other frosty matriarchs (James Bonds M). So the warmth under pressure she radiates here is nearly a surprise. As Philomena discovers more about her child Dench subtly conveys all the hopes and apprehensions the character has harbored for 50 years. Philomena Lee proved her mettle by never relinquishing her love and her mission. Judi Dench gives a performance of grace nuance and cinematic heroism. You might say its f--ing brilliant.

TWITTER British stars Judi Dench and Steve Coogan are a study in contrasts in Stephen Frears heartwarming but never banal drama. Stephen Frears is in full possession of his filmmaking talent in Philomena one of his most pulled-together dramas in years. The true story of a poor Irish woman who fifty years after being forced to give her 3-year-old son up for adoption searches for him with a worldly British journalist is touching witty and always absorbing. The inspired pairing of Dame Judi Dench and actor-writer-producer Steve Coogan who is currently riding the wave of the British hit Alan Partridge Alpha Papa will clinch the deal for most viewers and give the Pathe release a good shot at entertaining the world. The Weinstein Co. will release the title in the U.S. this fall after the film bows at Venice and Toronto. Though well-received by critics in Venice its chance of winning a major prize could be down-sized by its similarity to Peter Mullans The Magdalene Sisters which took home the Golden Lion in 2002. While Mullan depicted the lives of Irish girls who bore children out of wedlock and fell into the clutches of the Catholic Church as slave labor in the infamous Magdalene Laundries Frears is considerably more upbeat and casts his net wider.  Among the films themes broached with an incredibly light touch are the existence of God in a cruel world and the guilt society attaches to personal sexual expression whether heterosexual or homosexual. These topics are naturally and unpretentiously interwoven into Steve Coogan and Jeff Popes adaptation of Martin Sixsmiths non-fiction book. Most audiences will be hooked on the story which is a ""human interest"" one in the best sense. When she is a young girl Philomena Lee (Sophie Kennedy Clark) meets a good-looking boy at a fair. She is completely in the dark about where babies come from and this innocent seduction results in pregnancy. It also lands her in an institute for ""fallen women"" run by nuns of the Sacred Heart where she gives birth under horrible circumstances (""Pain is her penance."") Forced to spend years working in the sweat-shop laundry to pay off their ""debt"" to the order she and the other girls are allowed to see their children one hour a day until Mother Superior finds a buyer for the tykes. The heart-breaking scene of Philomena helplessly screaming as her little Anthony is taken away by a rich American couple in a big car is filmed like a scene from a Nazi film which is how the hatchet-faced nuns appear. Fifty years go by. Enter Martin Sixsmith (Coogan) a discouraged BBC journalist and former bureau chief who has traded up for an advisory job with the prime minister and has just been sacrificed. Without a job or future prospects he stumbles across Philomena (Dench) and her previously hidden story. Bankrolled by a daily newspaper he takes her to Washington to look for traces of her son and the rest of the film describes the surprising details of their search. At this point its all about veterans Dench and Coogan who make a delicious if a tad too predictable duet milking the British class system for non-stop humor that they seem able to turn on and off like a faucet. Considering the Coogan co-wrote his own witty dialogue he certainly gave himself a lot of good lines. Dench puts her Skyfall sophistication behind her but not her dignity in the title role. Martins supercilious affectation and Oxford ways contrast smartly with Phils homey wisdom and for instance her endearing affection for tawdry romantic fiction and her non-familiarity with international travel. Its remarkable these two fine actors pull it off without recourse to sentimentality. Philomena a devout Catholic even blunts Martins atheistic outrage at the Church and chooses to forgive the inhuman treatment she received showing how anti-inflammatory the films final message is. But even so it pulls no punches in describing the devastating effects of punishment for sexual pleasure. While old Sister Hildegarde rabidly goes on about punishing ""the carnal incontinence of girls"" Frears draws a sobering parallel with the AIDS crisis and the similarly cruel reaction of conservative America. Whose fault is sex? The film asks. Robbie Ryans cinematography like the other tech work is beautifully balanced and unobtrusive. Given the extended time frame Valerio Bonellis editing advances the story through natural-feeling flashbacks. Alexandre Desplats musical commentary is mellow and listenable. A footnote to history  actress Jane Russells autographed picture appears on the wall of the institute attesting to the fact that one of her three adopted children came from Ireland. According to a character in a local bar the going rate was 1000 pounds per child.

A howl of anti-clerical outrage wrapped in a tea cozy ""Philomena"" applies amusing banter and a sheen of good taste to the real-life quest of Philomena Lee an Irishwoman who spent decades searching for the out-of-wedlock son taken from her by Catholic nuns and sold into adoption overseas. Smoothly tooled as an odd-couple vehicle for Judi Dench in the title role and Steve Coogan as Martin Sixsmith the British journalist who brought Lees story to international attention this smug but effective middlebrow crowdpleaser boasts a sharper set of dentures than most films of its type shrewdly mining its material for laughs and righteous anger as well as tears.

Subscribe today.See more. In adapting Sixsmiths 2009 book ""The Lost Child of Philomena Lee"" Coogan and co-writer Jeff Pope have essentially merged a culture-clash comedy with ""The Magdalene Sisters"" Peter Mullans searing 2002 drama about the Irish Catholic asylums where thousands of ""fallen"" women were sent and punished for their sexual promiscuity. The Roscrea convent where Lee gave birth in 1952 appears to have been a marginally less inhumane place allowing the teenage mother (played in flashbacks by an excellent Sophie Kennedy Clark) to see her son Anthony for an hour each day in between back-breaking laundry shifts. But in 1955 the boy was taken away and adopted by a wealthy American family never to be seen again by his birth mother even though she spent decades searching for him. In the scripts tidier version of events Philomena (Dench) doesnt really begin her search for Anthony until the early 2000s when she finds an unlikely ally in Martin (Coogan) an ex-BBC correspondent and recently ousted civil servant trying to get back into the journalism game via the mildly humiliating route of writing a human-interest piece. After the nuns at the Roscrea convent prove singularly unhelpful politely but firmly reminding Philomena that she signed away all claims to the child she and Martin follow a lead to Washington D.C. hoping to find Anthony and re-establish contact. Its an undeniable whopper of a yarn and coming after a string of middling efforts from Frears easily the directors most compulsively watchable picture since ""The Queen."" It hardly gives away the storys outcome (by now of course a matter of public knowledge) to note that Martin and Philomenas journey winds up leading them after a fashion back to the Churchs doorstep setting the stage for an emotionally satisfying confrontation with the institutional forces of judgment repression and hysteria responsible for exploiting countless mothers and their long-lost children. Indeed ""Philomenas"" slap in the face of religious authority is stinging enough that it could draw ire from conservative groups and publications that care to take an interest which should only boost its commercial profile. (Along similar political lines Martins investigation even allows for a not-irrelevant swipe at the Reagan administrations AIDS policy.) These differences of culture values and temperament are not incidental to the films pleasures; they are in fact its primary narrative engine grounded in the tension between two improbably matched protagonists. Martin the cynical world-weary atheist who rudely questions everyone and everything could scarcely be more different from Philomena the sweet-tempered Irish biddy who still clings to her faith in God and humanity. And while Philomena may monopolize the title the film with its slick mocking tone and faintly condescending aftertaste is ultimately far more on Martins side. Much of the humor here comes at the expense of Philomenas naivete excessive grandmotherly kindness and lack of worldly sophistication and while the character is certainly fair game after a while its hard not to wonder if the writers are simply scoring points off her. Hearing Philomena prattle on and on about the romance novel she cant put down is genuinely amusing the first time; having her suggest they stay in their hotel and watch ""Big Mommas House"" on-demand taxes plausibility and patience. The patronizing sensibility at work even has a diminishing effect on Denchs otherwise fine dignified performance; appearing not very bright remains an obstacle that this fiercely intelligent actress only occasionally surmounts. Nonetheless she invests this twinkly-eyed paragon of virtue with real warmth and tenderness without overdoing the sentimentality and she can be surprisingly articulate when she needs to be often letting Martin know exactly what she thinks of his sour worldview. Dench and the script achieve their finest moments when Philomena for all her rectitude expresses a surprisingly open-minded view of sexuality rooted in her still-fond memories of the teenage fling that led to Anthonys conception in the first place. The two leads make decent sparring partners and better allies and Coogan is especially good whenever Martins impatient manner tilts into genuine moral indignation. Ace d.p. Robbie Ryans HD lensing brings an attractive polish to the D.C. and London locations but the films real formal coup lies in the flashbacks to 1950s Roscrea distinctively shot on Super 16 and evoking the grainy look of an earlier era.

Fawn says September 23 2013 at 658 pm My brother sugggested I might like this blog. He wwas totally right. This post truly made my day. You can not imagije simply how much time I had spent for this info Thanks Reply mary says September 11 2013 at 718 pm Curious that the article says ""sold ....abroad"" talking about the baby given in adoption of Philomena. The writer of this article (and/or the screenwriter)must be ignorant in the subject of how young mothers with the help or through catholic church/ orphanages had the children adopted. No money is part of the transaction. My parents as practicing-catholic attorneys at free of charge helped decades a go take care of national and international adoptions between young catholic mothers/orphans at catholic orphanages/boarding schools and catholic families. In which I assisted as a young attorney myself then. The very sad part is that in previous decades the parents were the first ones totake their daughters to catholic church institutions where they could stay while they were pregnant and afterwards if they whished prefwrably and to give their children for adoption and in the worst case scenario to doctors that would against the will of the young women practice and abortion. A personal friend of mine was one of this cases fortunately she ran away and was taken by a catholic shelter for unwed mothers and had her baby and kept it but took many years for her father to forgive her. There are many many catholic shelters for unwed pregnant women or mothers that have done such great work. Should also make a movie about that. Reply Justin Chang says September 18 2013 at 920 am http//www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/sep/19/catholic-church-sold-child Reply Pat Sutton says September 7 2013 at 515 am The parents of fallen girls should be fiercely condemned in books and films written and made about them; they played a large role in keeping institutions open by discarding their daughters. Hypocrisy was the order of the day in Ireland and to a certain extent in England where there were many Homes for Unmarried Mothers. I spent several months in one of these homes but where else could I and many of us have gone?

Doesnt Hollywood ever get tired of it. Cant wait to miss it. Reply GKN says August 31 2013 at 554 pm As the WASP majority love Catholic-bashing I doubt it will draw much ire.

Coogan is Martin Sixsmith a resolutely hard-nosed ex-BBC journalist trying to find his feet in the early 2000s after an unhappy stint in the shadows of politics. Dench is Philomena chalk to his cheese shes an ageing working-class Londoner who grew up in Ireland and whose late-life admission that she had a baby taken away from her in an convent as a young woman finds her travelling to Ireland and the US with Sixsmith whos intent on turning her life into column inches. Sixsmith - played with a buttoned-down reserve by Coogan only occasionally slipping into comic mugging - is slumming it by writing a human-interest story on Philomena for a midmarket tabloid. Philomena - given strength vulnerability and wit by Dench - is not sure why or if she wants to uncover these ghosts in her past. We see scenes of her youth in harrowing flashbacks and the story takes us to places of deep loss and pain. Yet Frears sidesteps easy melodrama in favour of a reserve tempered by mild comedy. Some of the early contrasts between Martin and Philomena are too insistent. But Philomena becomes more interesting when their individual and shared responses to their discoveries and disappointments en route turn out to be more complex than we fear they may be. Its a terrifically moving film that has a fitting earthbound feel to it as well as a barely suppressed anger at crimes inflicted on the powerless whether by the Catholic church or an unfeeling modern news media. It also has a sharp wit which stops it being a straight tragedy. Less successful perhaps is the films insistence on debating press ethics when in the context of such a personal story the behaviour of the church past and present and Philomena and Martins feelings towards it are so much more relevant and important. But still Philomena has important things to say about the role of religion in peoples lives even when its done them great harm or at least done them little good. It also offers a healthy dose of cheekiness to counter the gloom and best of all has a well-earned ring of complicated truth to it.

Co-written by comedian Steve Coogan starring as Martin Sixsmith - the ex-BBC journalist trying to renovate his career in journalism after a disastrous PR political mistake - Philomena is based on a working class Irish Londoner of the same name (played wonderfully by Judy Dench) who is trying to find her son who was taken from her and sold to a rich American family. Sixsmith whos intent on turning Philomenas human interest story into column inches to revive his flagging career undergoes a journey of self-discovery that leads him back to the brutal convent in Ireland where Phils son was taken away 50 years ago. The duality is sometimes over pronounced with Phil playing the religious chalky pariah to Martins cynical cheese but it makes for a fascinating relationship. Philomena -outgoing humorous but vulnerably elegant - has harrowing flashbacks to deep loss and pain base on her sin of having sex before marriage and conceiving her child Anthony out of wedlock for which her family ditches her with the sisters at Roscrea convent out of shame and her child put up for adoption. The couple try to unravel what happened to Anthony and are rebuffed at every turn by the convent who fabricate stories and steadfastly refuse to help Phil out of a staunch belief her sin cannot be rectified. Its only when the landlady in the local pub offers that the children from the convent were sold off to American families and Martin and Philomena travel to America that they actually begin an emotional journey to unravel the truth about his adoption. It takes us all the way to the US political senate taking in notions of national and gay pride and generational self-discovery along the way returning full circle to the rural unkempt graveyard in Roscrea Ireland. Throughout Sixsmiths editor pushes the newsman to his limit to get the story and we are introduced to the softer side of Coogans character and his conflicting dilemma in helping Phil on a human level to revealing this heartbreaking personal story to the world. It is an interesting dynamic that creates suppressed anger not just at the inhumane practices of the Catholic church but also that of mainstream news media to the point you begin wondering which is worse. Philomena says important things about religion and this comes across in Philomenas faith and forgiveness in the unrepentant nature of the sisters and Martins frustration and acerbic wit. It also brings a comedic edge to the tragedy and makes the audience question what is really important in their own life.

MORE FROM FRANCE 24 Web Documentary Alma Wins FRANCE 24-RFI Prize Veteran Broadcaster David Frost Dies at 74 French Pupils Head Back to School Under New Reforms A high point  of the directors short though distinguished filmography the movie tells the story of three Oregon environmentalists who plot to blow up a hydraulic dam the emblem of an industrial culture they see as ruining the world.A Riveting Moral Thriller The central figure is Josh (Jesse Eisenberg right) a reserved young man who works on an organic vegetable farm. His partners in protest are Dena (Dakota Fanning) a college dropout from a wealthy family and Harmon (Peter Sarsgaard) a jaded former Marine.The first half of Night Moves details the trios preparation for their mission the brainstorming the logistical setbacks and re-adjustments a bit of bickering and a hint of a love triangle--though the rigorously melodrama-averse Reichardt wisely never pushes that angle.Through small perfectly observed moments Reichardt (working with screenwriting partner Jon Raymond) suggests that united as they may seem the main characters have arrived at their extremism from different paths and places Josh who rarely thinks out loud or justifies his actions seems to be the most persuaded of the three; Denas anti-establishment ecologically inclined views may or may not stem from a reflex of rebellion against her privileged upbringing; and Harmon sometimes appears to be torn between revolution and pursuit of pleasure.Eisenberg usually plays chatty neurotics but he has a coiled mysterious quality here; he makes Josh both frightening and fragile.In the films second half we see these three commit their act of ""eco-terrorism""--and then deal with the aftermath. Reichardts characteristically thoughtful unobtrusive style a model of visual precision and economy turns slightly more voluptuous as the story darkens winding its way through some surprising twists. The final act of Night Moves finds the filmmaker using music shadow and light close-ups and atypically dramatic camera angles to gently push the tension to its limits. Meanwhile images and moments from early in the film--women emerging from a sauna a shot of Joshs trembling hands an encounter with a garrulous hiker--take on new meaning in the closing sequences.Sarsgaard is terrific as always but Night Moves hinges mainly on the other two leads both superb. Eisenberg usually plays chatty neurotics but he has a coiled mysterious quality here; he makes Josh both frightening and fragile. Fanning who began her career as an eerily self-assured child actress has mellowed into a distinctive adult screen presence with slightly smudged-looking features and a soft voice that fools you into thinking shes barely acting.Most gratifying of all though is the way Night Moves shows Reichardt developing and refining both her craft and her thematic obsessions. Her films have all dealt in some way with Americans struggling against the dominant ethos of their time Old Joy revolved around the fraying bond between an upwardly mobile thirty-something and his hippie-dippy childhood friend; Wendy and Lucy followed a cash-strapped female drifter whose desperate search for her lost dog gradually reveals just how far outside society she has strayed; and in Meeks Cutoff a pioneer woman comes to realize her discomfort with the submissive role imposed on both her and the Native Americans living on the land she and her husband are trying to find and settle.In Night Moves Reichardt continues exploring her ideas about the limitations pressures and dilemmas of American non-conformism. Like most good filmmakers she discovers more questions than answers. But in the process she secures her spot as one of the very best US directors working today.Judi Dench in a Slick Melodrama The biggest competition crowd-pleaser--the film that generated the most laughter tears and applause--has been British director Stephen Frearss Philomena starring Judi Dench as an Irish woman who enlists former BBC reporter Martin Sixsmith (played by Steve Coogan) to help find her long-lost son.The film is based on a true story Philomena Lee was one of many ""fallen"" Irish women in the 1950s shamed into giving up babies they had out of wedlock to nuns who in turn sold them to wealthy American couples looking to adopt.Despite moments of wit Philomena is essentially a tearjerker complete with a cloying score.Frears gives the story a slick makeover blending melodrama and comedy with brisk professionalism and a hearty helping of schmaltz. Despite moments of wit (the director wrings odd-couple humor from the relationship between working-class devoutly Catholic Philomena and posh cynical atheist Sixsmith) Philomena is essentially a tearjerker complete with a cloying score from Alexandre Desplat.Dench and Coogan sell it well occasionally cutting through the high-minded sentiment to dig up some real emotion. But coming from the director who gave us films like the nimble imaginative The Queen and the delicious noir The Grifters this is far from Frears at his best.James Franco and director Gia Coppola at the Venice Film Festival.(AP / Andrew Medichini)Franco Fever on the Red Carpet Meanwhile the biggest attraction for the Italian fan girls camped out next to the red carpet was US actor-director-writer-provocateur James Franco. His arrival for the screening of his competition entry Child of God (adapted from the Cormac McCarthy novel) drew screams and even a collective lunge deftly contained by a couple of good-humored security guards.It was the most rapturous response to a star that Ive seen here yet--tied perhaps with the stampede of fans who nearly ran me over while chasing a limo bringing Daniel Radcliffe (aka Harry Potter) from the festival premises to his hotel.Gia Coppola is a talent to watch.As for Francos film itself the reception was cooler. The story of Lester Ballard a roving raving outcast prone to bursts of violence and necrophilia in 1950s Tennessee Child of God is shot with rough raw energy and steeped in a suitably barren Southern atmosphere. Its also a chore to sit through a dramatically shapeless movie which demands that we accompany the scowling anti-hero while he wanders rapes defecates and yells until he froths at the mouth for 104 very slow-moving minutes.The little-known Scott Haze sinks his teeth into the main role with theatrical glee doing everything short of grabbing the camera and swallowing it whole. His is the kind of grating fully committed performance that the jury may choose to reward.Much to the excitement of his autograph-hungry groupies Franco showed up a second time to help present Palo Alto the debut film from Gia Coppola (Francis Ford Coppolas granddaughter) which is based on Francos book Palo Alto Stories and features the actor in a supporting role.The film treads no new narrative or stylistic ground; its a look at the lives of unhappy privileged white teens in the northern California suburb of the title and Coppola is clearly going for the dreamy lyricism that characterizes her aunt Sofias work.But Palo Alto is an example of how to turn been-there-done-that material into something luminous. Following the obnoxious Fred (Nat Wolff) his quieter sidekick Teddy (Jack Kilmer son of Val) pretty pensive April (Emma Roberts niece of Julia) and boy-crazy Emily (Zoe Levin) through the usual rites of smoking drinking hooking up and hanging out Coppola crafts fresh images that are alive both to her subjects churning sexuality and their inner lives.The filmmaker proves especially empathetic toward the female characters who learn some hard lessons through their dealings with the men that surround them (including the seductive soccer coach played by a very good Franco).Coppola also displays a sure hand with her cast most notably coaxing a radiant star-making turn from Roberts as an object of desire still learning how to articulate what she herself wants.If the impact of Palo Alto is significantly limited by the familiarity of the story its depiction of adolescent behavior--the forced apathy the impulsiveness the tendency to do things that cant be explained rationally--rings true.Coppola is a talent to watch.JFK Assassination Film Parkland Disappoints Another first film Peter Landesmans Parkland was less impressive.A reconstitution of the three days following JFKs assassination in 1963 the film which screened in competition on Sunday starts off well. The director makes fine use of handheld camerawork and quick editing in scenes of secret service agents scrambling in the wake of the shooting while hospital-set sequences in which a shell-shocked young resident (Zac Efron) and head nurse (Marcia Gay Harden) try to resuscitate the president are tense and stirring.But once Kennedy is pronounced dead Parkland goes downhill fast with a tone of TV-movie solemnity epitomized by James Newton Howards heavy-handed score taking over.Once Kennedy is pronounced dead ""Parkland"" goes downhill fast with a tone of TV-movie solemnity.Things get flat-out weird--and not in a good way--when the usually reliable Jacki Weaver (Silver Linings Playbook) enters the picture as Lee Harvey Oswalds kooky mother Marguerite. Her howler of a performance--shrill voice erratic accent cartoonish facial expressions--nudges the film toward camp which is unfortunate for what is meant to be a portrait of a wrenching American moment.Parkland isnt bad exactly. But the director hasnt found a way to make his glimpse at the immediate aftermath of one of the defining traumas of contemporary US history feel urgent. On the contrary the film ends up feeling unnecessary and undistinguished. Aside from the fact that November will mark the 50th anniversary of JFKs death why make this movie now?Versions of this post also appear on France 24 an Atlantic partner site.

Twitter previousBack Pain Worse in Summer?nextThe Mysterious and Alarming Rise of Single Parenthood in America Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics. Continue Reading Tom Pennington / Getty Images The Mind of Donald Trump Dan P. McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Stephanie Loos/Reuters The Elusive Manipulative Adopted Child Tina Traster Learning how to bond with my daughter who found comfort in the familiarity of being alone has come through understanding reactive attachment disorder. My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion. Continue Reading Gary Cameron / Reuters Trump Time Capsule 62 A Man Who Can Be Baited With a Tweet James Fallows None Last night in her overall very successful acceptance speech Hillary Clinton said with ruthless precision about her opponent Ask yourself Does Donald Trump have the temperament to be Commander-in-Chief? Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

Graham A federal appeals court finds the impact of the states voting law can only be explained by ""discriminatory intent."" Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz.
