Comments click to enlarge The Worlds Fastest Indian Recommended Watch on Netflix Roger Donaldson has directed as many misses (The Getaway The Recruit) as hits (Smash Palace No Way Out) but this compelling fact-based story is his best effort in years. Anthony Hopkins gives a detailed quirky performance as Burt Munro a half-deaf New Zealander in his late 60s whos spent years refining his beloved 1920 Indian motorcycle in hopes of competing in the annual land-speed trials at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah. The story becomes especially engaging when Burt finally embarks on his journey meeting all manner of humanity along the way and enduring a bad ticker and an enlarged prostate to compete in the race.

Back in the 1960s an ageing New Zealander called Burt Munro set out across Utahs Bonneville Salt Flats on his home-tweaked 1920 Indian motorcycle and against all odds went on to break a land-speed record. Director Roger Donaldson opts for such a simple chronological format that you could leave it for 15 minutes and not miss a trick. Its Anthony Hopkinss performance that really invigorates this easy-going Straight Story-esque road odyssey. His portrayal is of an eccentric stoic old coot with a dicky heart who bores the pants off everyone (and maybe you) with small talk about the piston rings he knocks up in his garage. His neighbours still love him though and join the community in raising enough readies to help him discover his dream never believing for a minute that hed actually pull it off. When he gets to the States Munro bumps into a gaggle of Lynchian weirdos yet accepts them for what they are without batting an eyelid. Hes just so damn likeable that everyone he meets chips in to help and thats what gives the movie its charm.Despite a few cornball cliches the film builds to an impressive will he/wont he climax when the underdog finally makes it to Utah and is told that his bike doesnt meet the safety requirements - but then whats a little adversity to a man who lived by the Malcolm Campbell code of old-fashioned risk-taking? The films beautifully mounted has an authentically 60s feel and is mostly very engaging. Its funny too.

Photo courtesy Raoul Butler. Burt Munro (Anthony Hopkins) on his modified Indian motorcycle in The Worlds Fastest Indian  a Magnolia Pictures release. Photo courtesy Raoul Butler. Photo Magnolia Pictures Pure of heart and swift of motorcycle 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Worlds Fastest Indian Drama. Starring Anthony Hopkins. Directed by Roger Donaldson. (PG-13. 127 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""The Worlds Fastest Indian"" might be the worlds worst title for a charming slice-of-life biopic starring Anthony Hopkins. What does it mean? Does Hopkins play an Indian? Does he run a lot? Both are unpromising prospects. In fact he plays a New Zealand motorcycle enthusiast a real-life fellow by the name of Burt Munro (1899-1978) who at the age of 68 broke the land-speed record at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah. The ""Indian"" of the title refers to the brand of motorcycle he drove a 1920 Indian that he tinkered with in his garage for many years turning it into a combination rocket/junk heap/death trap/glory of the age. All this makes ""The Worlds Fastest Indian"" qualify as a kind of sports movie and to a degree it benefits from the usual sports-movie excitement The sheer spectacle the will-he-do-it the can-he-do-it the rooting interest the kick of racing in general. But the movies real appeal runs deeper than that just as the narrative approach of Roger Donaldson who wrote and directed is more ambitious. Donaldson takes Munros story and turns it into a whimsical voyage and return saga the odyssey of a man pure in heart across a troubled America. The focus is not so much on Munros accomplishments as it is on his personality which is made vivid in Hopkins performance. He plays Munro as a scattered man an eccentric not quite in tune with his fellows isolated somewhat by his own peculiar brilliance and by some hearing loss. (I never saw a film in which a lead character asked ""What dya say?"" so often.) Hes a fascinating character seemingly going through life encased in a protective vagueness yet casually demonstrating a laser-like acuity at select moments. He might be a genius but to his credit he doesnt seem to know it. A movie like this can only start in first gear. Burt is an old man who putters in his garage all day waking up the neighbors letting his lawn go to seed collecting junk in his backyard a likable crank. He seems like a fellow near the finish line. He has angina attacks and has to carry around a bottle of nitroglycerin pills. He has a lifelong dream of going to the Salt Flats and really letting his motorcycle rip but it doesnt seem realistic. Its not realistic -- they dont make movies about realistic people. As is fitting for a voyage saga every aspect of Burts journey from New Zealand to Utah is fraught with trouble. Because of his limited means his only transportation option is to ride a freighter and serve as the ships cook. When he arrives in Los Angeles he gets a nasty cab driver is propositioned and robbed by a prostitute and ends up staying in a fleabag hotel. But his oblivious good cheer and nonjudgmental nature get him through most situations. His personality cracks through peoples reserve. ""The Worlds Fastest Indian"" is as much about the getting there as it is about what Burt does after he arrives. Burt encounters all kinds of people from Los Angeles to Bonneville and somewhere midway the lovely thing happens The movie takes on a magical quality. In one scene he stumbles into a romantic interlude with a farmwoman his own age. In another he walks into bars and strikes up conversation with anyone he sees. Donaldson finds a pleasant measured rhythm and makes a viewer feel as if it would be quite all right to watch Burts journey for hours and hours. He is after all the only unself-conscious man in America and we look upon him in the same way as most people do in the movie with bemusement at first then fascination and then affection. Its wise on Donaldsons part to show that not everyone is susceptible to Burts eccentric charm. Some people feel threatened by his purity some are callously amused by it some are sour and unreachable. Donaldson depicts the America of the mid-1960s as a place of burgeoning anxiety a stewpot of ugliness and sweetness and leftover innocence. Burt an instinctive egalitarian who sees everyone as of equal value serves as a human Rorschach test. People react to him in accordance with their own individual character and degree of mental health while he remains contented and unchanged. -- Advisory Sexual situations.

These ageist sobriquets delivered by a variety of people in a variety of tones have two distinct narrative goals. One is to remind us Hopkins character is ahem old. The other is to remind us hes cute. The fact we need no such reminder is wholly beside the point because the film is built upon his charms In scene after scene he disarms skeptics with his crinkled Kiwi stick-to-it-tive-ness and folksy little saws. ""Danger is the spice of life"" he says. And ""If you dont follow your dreams you might as well be a vegetable"" (specifically cabbage). And again ""A man is like a blade of grass"" though its rather unclear why. The font of this wisdom is Burt Munro the spry New Zealander who at the youthful age of 63 took a souped-up motorcycle to the Utah salt flats in pursuit of land-speed glory. His legendary ride of choice was a 1920 Indian Scout -- already an antique in 1962 when the film begins. It shows him fiddling with the thing in his barn making pistons shaving tread off tires with a carving knife drinking tea with an adoring young neighbor (Aaron Murphy durned cute himself). The boys parents are fond of Burt but wish he werent quite so eccentric. Mainly they wish hed mow his lawn and stop peeing on his lemon tree. Townsfolk raise money for his trip secretly thinking the old dog hasnt a chance. And once hes on his way every naysayer greets him with this same bemused affection telling him hes too old or the bikes too old or he cant ride during Bonneville Speed Week without a safety chute. First they think hes nuts. Then they think hes nuts but they like him. Finally still kind-of-sort-of-maybe suspecting hes nuts they adore him madly and cheer him on. See Burt bluff a used car salesman. Hear him disarm a transvestite (Chris Williams who disarms right back) or wiggle his way out of a traffic violation. A few characters including the women who haul him into bed skip the skepticism and cut straight to the adoration which Burt accepts with utmost grace and winking adorability. Hopkins is hard to dislike in any role and hes having such a ball in this one I didnt begrudge him anything; he snowed me. To watch this knight of the realm prostrate on a rocket-red motorbike grinning and begoggled in his ""bash hat"" is to marvel at the complete ingenuous joy of a man with nothing left to prove. Actors are haunted by the aging process but it can liberate them too shaking off chains of artiness or conceit that keep them (and us) from having fun. The Worlds Fastest Indian has only that in mind. Written and directed by Roger Donaldson (who helmed a much younger and darker Hopkins in 1984s underrated Bligh apologia The Bounty) the film may be cutesy-poo for some tastes and there isnt much nail-chewing suspense in Burts pursuit or his lighthearted subjugation of everyone he meets. Surely somebody somewhere hated the guy. But man and ""motor-sickle"" sneaked up and beguiled me so all I could do was hop on. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals 3P Military Tactical Oxford 30L Backpack for 12 + free shipping Lighting amp; Ceiling Fans at Home Depot Up to 80% off + free...

Perky. Jaunty. Feisty. Plucky plucky plucky. ""The Worlds Fastest Indian"" is the kind of movie that makes critics squirm and look over their shoulder. When they do they often find other members of the audience beaming happily at the movie screen. Its a crowd-pleaser not a critic-pleaser and theres nothing wrong with that if you enjoy Anthony Hopkins at the peak of his incorrigibility. So when I explain what seems more than a little shallow about ""Worlds Fastest Indian"" trust your own reactions. What appears cartoonish to me may be delightfully picaresque to you; those scenes that play as stereotypical to me could satisfy you as touchstones of American culture. The ""WFI"" in question is a 1920 Indian motorcycle a legendary marquee resting on blocks in the weed-strewn yard of Burt Munros New Zealand garage. Crusty old Munro (Hopkins of course) sleeps next to his workbench revs his bike engines early in the morning and relieves himself where he wants regardless of which neighbors might see. Munro circa 1967 has a dream To take his meticulously modified machine to Utahs Bonneville Salt Flats and set a speed record in his class. The words ""old coot"" were invented for Hopkins in this role and everyone dutifully dismisses him as nuts. Fun at the pub but nuts. ""WFI"" is crammed with sour codgers cute kids surly youths officious officials and maximum schmaltz. The best scenes from director Roger Donaldson who brought his love-child of a movie as a featured selection at last Novembers Starz Denver International Film Festival involve machinery. Hopkins has dirt under his nails and when hes melting old motorcycle pistons to make a perfect hybrid he looks as if he knows titanium from petroleum. The cringe-inducing scenes - again for those whove seen enough of Hopkins after about 10 minutes - arrive during Munros American road trip. He lands in Los Angeles with the motorcycle but without a clue. He promptly meets a transvestite with a heart of gold a slick used-car salesman with a heart of gold and an American Indian with a heart of gold and a helpful talisman to boot. If youre still wondering about Brave Burt and that land speed record you havent been paying attention. ""The Worlds Fastest Indian"" takes off at full-out maudlin and never bothers to throttle down. Theres a cockiness to the mood that almost works and its all aimed over the critics shoulders at the people who are still smiling. Any movie that uses a line like ""Youre not from around these parts"" isnt really meant for people who arent from around these parts.

"Fastest Indian takes some time to develop - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Fastest Indian takes some time to develop By Janice Page Globe Correspondent  |  February 3 2006 It has nothing to do with New Delhi or the Old West. The Worlds Fastest Indian"" is about a motorcycle and as any informed motorcyclist knows the Indian is an elite breed with a storied history.Just stop reading here if you dont want to know some of that history before you see the movie.In this touching but uneven film written and directed by Roger Donaldson (The Recruit"" No Way Out"") Anthony Hopkins plays Burt Munro a legendary New Zealander who in the 1960s shot to fame as one of the oldest people ever to set a land speed record. Munros chariot of choice was a 1920 Indian Twin Scout painstakingly restored and refined by its frugal rider using (if the screenplay is accurate) everything from a kitchen door hinge to the cork off a brandy bottle. It propelled Munro to speeds greater than 200 miles per hour which might not sound like much today but consider that Munros bike -- manufactured at the hallowed plant in Springfield -- was designed to top out at 54 m.p.h.Donaldsons passion for his subject is never in question. He became acquainted with Munro in the early 1970s when the director was making a documentary for New Zealand television called Offerings to the God of Speed."" Apparently hes held onto the hope of making a dramatic version of the mans story ever since which may be why The Worlds Fastest Indian"" begins by revisiting the offerings"" phrase scrawled in chalk along an altar of bike parts in Munros shed.That shed is also Munros home by the way.The sexagenarian Kiwi cyclist is a near-deaf eccentric who revs his engine at all hours and fertilizes his lemon tree by peeing on it. Its not a promising start that hes befriended by a wide-eyed boy (Aaron Murphy) with disapproving parents -- the first part of this film is cliched and unmoving; it only really has a chance when it hits the open road.Jolted by bad news from his doctor Munro decides its now or never His lifelong dream of clocking the Indian at full throttle rests on traveling all the way to Utahs famed Bonneville Salt Flats in time for Speed Week. So he packs her onto a cargo ship and sets off destined to overcome many fish-out-of-water obstacles with the cheery help of a transvestite (Chris Williams) a used-car salesman (Paul Rodriguez) and Diane Ladd as a one-night stand.The film is at its best in Utah both because in David Gribbles exhilarating cinematography we finally get to feel the full power and intoxication of the sport and because Hopkinss layered but large performance becomes less of a focal point. The triumph comes when Donaldson (who last directed Hopkins in The Bounty"") strips away the clutter to a wordless image of man and machine.History dictates that you know how the story ends. Still the heart beats no less fast when you watch Munros Indian rocketing across those salt flats. You can see how it might be enough to justify a journey halfway around the world.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor February 3 2006 Save for later Saved In 1971 director Roger Donaldson made a documentary about Burt Munro the 72-year-old New Zealander who four years earlier had broken the land speed record for motorcycles. Now hes fulfilled a long-time ambition to dramatize Munros achievement and the result is ""The Worlds Fastest Indian"" starring Anthony Hopkins as the supersonic old coot.When we first see Burt he is living in the small town of Invercargill and is dependably eccentric in everything he does. His weedy overgrown yard and cinder-block hut are a (deliberate) affront to his neighbors manicured abodes. His method of watering his lemon trees is well all natural.His passion aside from aggravating the townspeople is his 1920 Indian Scout motorbike which he modifies until hes satisfied its the fastest thing on two wheels. Except for the wide-eyed boy next door and a sympathetic lady friend nobody believes Burt when he says hes going to blow away the competition in the annual speed racing competition in the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Just getting to Utah proves to be an odyssey of Homeric proportions. A stormy ocean passage to Los Angeles is followed by a series of on-the-road misadventures involving a doting transvestite motel clerk a San Fernando Valley car dealer (Paul Rodriguez) an old Indian and a rambunctious earth mother (Diane Ladd). When he arrives in the salt flats he discovers he hasnt registered for the event and faces disqualification. (The flats have a bleached white shimmer that is as unearthly as a lunar landscape.) Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Throughout it all Burt is remarkably even-tempered despite the bum ticker that keeps slowing him down. In New Zealand his eccentricities repelled people but in America he is adopted by almost everyone he meets. His openness to even the most wayward personalities like that motel clerk is refreshing. The late 60s was a good time for Burt to arrive in America - as a kind of silvered hippie he could fit right in.Hopkins gives what is for him a low-key performance. He is often actorish when hes playing villains - ranging from Hannibal Lector to Richard Nixon - but Burts innate sweetness loosens him up. He obviously cares a great deal about conveying the truth of Burts experience.This sometimes puts his performance at odds with Donaldsons direction which is always on the verge of turning Burt into a full-blown folk hero. At times in order to balance out Donaldsons hero worship Hopkins overcompensates by making Burt positively ordinary. There are times when I wished Hopkins had struck a more heroic pose.But I suppose thats the point of his performance Burt never thought of himself in that way so why should we?Donaldson grew up in Australia before moving as a teen to New Zealand and has had a highly uneven career. His 1981 breakthrough movie ""Smash Palace"" about an enraged father whose child has been taken from him by his ex-wife signaled the arrival of a major talent. But his subsequent career after moving to Hollywood has been mostly undistinguished. ""The Bounty"" was powerful (and starred Hopkins as Captain Bligh) but films like ""Cocktail"" ""The Getaway"" ""Species"" and ""Dantes Peak"" didnt exactly enhance his reputation.""The Worlds Fastest Indian"" is clearly Donaldsons attempt to get back to his roots and make a humanely scaled movie. But he has toiled too long in Hollywood and some of his bad habits have become ingrained. This film would be better if it wasnt so slick. Still parts of it are enjoyably shaggy and Hopkins is very endearing. Grade B+ Rated PG-13 for brief language drug use and a sexual reference.Sex/Nudity 5 instances of innuendo or implied sex. Violence 3 mild instances. Profanity 2 strong expressions 24 milder. Drugs/Alcohol/Tobacco 5 scenes of drinking and/or smoking 1 scene of marijuana use.

Munro who died in 1978 at the age of 79 is depicted in this admiring specialty-act pic as a Crazy Old Guy With a Dream (and as played by Anthony Hopkins in a full-throttle thespian joyride as quite the Old Ladies Man). Donaldson who first trailed the real Burt Munro to make the 1971 documentary Offerings to the God of Speed makes his subjects every setback and advance an opportunity to applaud relentless Kiwi gumption. Reunited with the director some 20 years after the two worked together on The Bounty Hopkins savors every bit of business as his Burt charms everyone in his path His friends include local toughs back home and a fetching transvestite motel clerk in L.A. Munro was apparently the kind of coot who could knock on a strangers door in the desert and end up in bed with a lively gal (Diane Ladd). Crank it Grandpa.

"Worlds Fastest Indian The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; world-s-fastest-indian-the ) Worlds Fastest Indian The (New Zealand 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli The Worlds Fastest Indian is not as the title might suggest a National Geographic special. Instead its a based-on-a-true-story tale that crosses no fewer than four genres in the space of a little more than two hours. Although some aspects of the movie work better than others the production as a whole leaves the viewer enveloped in a warm afterglow. And the steady reassuring presence of Anthony Hopkins who has disappeared beneath the skin of his character holds things together during the weaker moments. Burt Munro (Hopkins) was born in 1899 and died in 1978 at the age of 78. In his native New Zealand he was (at least for a while) something of a national hero although he is little known throughout the rest of the world except in select circles. In 1963 Munro made the long trip from Down Under to Utah to enter his modified 1920 Indian Scout motorcycle in ""Speed Week"" at the Bonneville Speedway. It was his first of numerous trips and in 1967 he set a speed record that stands today. The Worlds Fastest Indian chronicles Burts first trip to Bonneville and is based on Donaldsons 1971 made-for-TV documentary Offerings to the God of Speed. The Worlds Fastest Indian starts out as a mismatched buddy film with Burt the curmudgeon hanging out with a boy named Tom (Aaron Murphy). Nearly everyone in the neighborhood including Toms parents thinks Burt is disreputable and a bad influence but that doesnt prevent Tom from spending countless hours in the old mans workshop. It has been Burts lifelong dream to take his beloved motorcycle to the Utah salt flats to find out how fast he can go and that dream comes a step closer to reality when Burt is able to raise the money. So its off to Los Angeles where The Worlds Fastest Indian becomes a fish-out-of-water movie (think Crocodile Dundee with Hopkins in the title role). After dawdling a while in Hollywood Burt buys a car and heads northeast for Utah. Cue the road movie. Finally Donaldsons mixed genre odyssey ends with an inspirational sports segment in which Burt reaches his goal and must battle rules and regulations to get a chance to realize his dream. The Worlds Fastest Indian is at its strongest in the beginning and the end. The middle sags a little. Although the fish-out-of-water sequences are cute the road movie vignettes are unremarkable. Burt has encounters with a few odd people an old Indian an independent woman who offers him a warm bed for a night and a soldier on leave from Viet Nam. Theres a sense that much of the road trip material is padding. The only way it adds to the movie is giving us an opportunity to spend some more time with Burt. The film is probably too small to garner Hopkins the attention needed for an Oscar nomination. Whether this is one of the best lead male performances of 2005 is open to debate but theres no question that Hopkins throws himself into the role doing what all great character actors do losing himself in the part. From the first frame we think of Hopkins as Burt not an actor playing a role. The crowning moment occurs late in the film when Burt reaches ""hallowed ground."" Hopkins plays this scene with quiet passion and reverence. After appearing in so many high-profile commercial motion pictures Hopkins was anxious to do a project like this. Its a tribute to his versatility as an actor that he can pull it off. Donaldson has long had a passion for Burt. Despite being well established in the Hollywood community with more than ten major films on his resume Donaldson chose to return to his homeland of New Zealand to make The Worlds Fastest Indian. Although more than half of the film takes place in the United States no American money was invested in the production. Its worth noting that the movies impressions of this country during the 60s are almost uniformly positive. Many foreign directors making films about the United States adopt a negative tone (Lars Von Trier comes to mind); that is not true of Donaldson. One could argue that he romanticizes the country but perhaps thats how Burt saw it when he stumbled ashore unawares in 1963. Most of the people Burt meets are helpful. His ""foes"" if the term is to be used are the regulations which he routinely flouts. A free spirit from a small New Zealand town he is baffled by all of the rules that govern American life. If you take a step back and look at The Worlds Fastest Indian its about a mans spiritual journey. Burts life philosophy is easily explained ""You live more in five minutes on a bike like this going flat out than some people live in a lifetime."" He doesnt believe in an afterlife and would agree with the sentiment ""Eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we die."" Burts unassuming personality wins people over with ease - both on-screen characters and audience members. The smile on my face at the end of the movie allowed me to forgive its uneven tone and sloppiness with dates. The Worlds Fastest Indian does what it sets out to do educates about a mostly unknown historical figure (without doctoring the facts too much) entertains and uplifts.

Like a geriatric ""Rocky"" on wheels ""The Worlds Fastest Indian"" tells the tale of a funny old coot who sets out to become the worlds fastest motorcyclist at an age when most of his contemporaries are settling into rocking chairs. Sometimes shticky biopic overcomes its cornball conventionality to become a genial entertainment thanks to Anthony Hopkins exceptionally engaging perf. New Zealand production picked up by Magnolia Pictures for U.S. distribution at the start of the Toronto fest has little to offer younger audiences but would be an oldsters delight if they could be induced to give it a look. In 1971 Kiwi-Aussie director Roger Donaldson made a documentary ""Offerings to the God of Speed"" about Burt Munro a then-72-year-old New Zealander who a few years earlier had taken his self-modified 1920 Indian Scout motorcycle across the Pacific to run it on Utahs Bonneville Salt Flats and set a worlds record in the process. Helmers abiding love for his subject comes through loud and clear in this dramatized retelling which he wrote himself and has been trying to make for years. Dramatic approach is straightforward and at moments cringingly hokey. But the heart of the matter the whimsically resilient personality of its subject rings so true as to prevail over the scripts ordinariness and silly indulgences. Theres reason to fear the worst at the outset as Burt is presented as the local loon in his small-town Invercargill neighborhood a kook who lives in a cinderblock hut pees on his lemon tree and tinkers endlessly with his ancient motorbike. An adoring little boy is provided to give Burt a sounding board as is an attractive lady friend for moral support and an unexpected roll in the hay. So lost in his own little world is Burt that its hard for anyone (viewers included) to believe this robust-looking fellow with a heart condition could ever turn his Bonneville dream into reality. But with his own meager savings and modest contributions Burt lines up ocean passage on a rusty bucket and winds up in Los Angeles. But no matter how contrived his first American friendship -- with a transvestite motel clerk -- may be its the start of a pattern that ends up the films keynote Burt is so open to life and its multitudinous possibilities that all manner of people immediately spark to him and help him out. Even this may seem simplistic on paper but by this time Hopkins has won over the viewer as well with a disarming perf marked by modesty and the curious little laugh with which he inflects many of his more important lines. Hopkins has become most celebrated for portraying commanding often evil men (he was a revisionist Captain Bligh in his first teaming with Donaldson 21 years ago in ""The Bounty"") but here for once hes relaxed humorous and enormously likable in an unpredictable turn that entirely avoids lovable-old-codger cliches. Burts American odyssey includes quick convenient and entirely winning friendships with a San Fernando Valley car dealer (Paul Rodriguez) an old Indian who puts him up for a night and a high-spirited desert widow (Diane Ladd) who does the same -- only in her own bed. Arriving at Bonneville which is captured in all its blinding beauty by lenser David Gribble Burt needs all the help he can get as he has not pre-registered. Hes aided by a Yank driver (Chris Lawford) in convincing authorities to let him run. Climactic race in which Burt sets a record of 201 mph across the vast white expanse of packed salt is excitingly covered. The film offers no complexities details about Burts earlier life and family or even hints about why his old bike is so much faster than new models. Button-pushing score emphasizes the most obvious emotional notes of the story. Despite it all however pic leaves a sweet rather than sticky taste.
