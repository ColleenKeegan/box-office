"Revved-Up Biker Boyz A Rousing Ride washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Revved-Up Biker Boyz A Rousing Ride Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Special to The Washington Post Friday January 31 2003 ""Biker Boyz"" is a teenage drag-racing movie reminiscent of the motorcycle melodramas of the 1950s in which adolescents ran rampant through Americas streets like so many aliens or communists or simply hormone-powered ids. The movie hews to the formulaic demands of the genre which combines the taut showdowns of the Western the structure of the musical (every race is like a song-and-dance number) and the underlying narrative of a social problem picture. But its on this last point that ""Biker Boyz"" could be called truly original In a twist the members of its motorcycle gangs are predominantly African American. And they come from middle-class suburbia and white-collar professions rather than ghettos housing projects or other literal or metaphoric dead ends. Its a refreshing addition to last years encouraging crop of films that take black middle-class life as a given (""Drumline"" ""Antwone Fisher"" ""Barbershop"") rather than a deviation from the pathology audiences usually see on-screen. And ""Biker Boyz"" features an outstanding cast of young and veteran actors including Laurence Fishburne and Derek Luke. Luke who made a remarkably restrained debut in ""Antwone Fisher"" as a young man coming to terms with a troubled past here proves that hes no flash in the pan. He provides quiet strong ballast to ""Biker Boyz"" and goes head-to-head with Fishburne with the aplomb of a pro. Still its a motorcycle movie and although director Reggie Rock Blythewood has tweaked some stereotypes a bit he hasnt tampered with the genres essentials loud engines lots of leather and glaring looks sharply edited race and stunt sequences and an overarching worship of men and their toys. Luke plays Kid who has grown up in the world of illicit drag racing in California where men who are lawyers by day race their motorcycles down empty streets by night. Its the tribal ritual of wannabes They have the disposable income to buy the biggest bike and the baddest clothes and they speak in the street vernacular that would get them fired or ostracized in their day jobs. ""Biker Boyz"" doesnt dwell on that contradiction though. Instead the film focuses on Kids relationship to Smoke (Fishburne) the ""King of Cali"" and undefeated drag-racing champion of the state. Kids father is Smokes mechanic until he is killed in a terrible accident; after that and especially after a whopper of a third-act revelation Kid and Smoke embark on a mytho-poetic rivalry that can culminate only in a duel to the death -- at least of a reputation. Blythewood doesnt question the silly rituals that look even sillier when someone of Fishburnes stature does them -- Freud would have a heyday with the psychosexual implications of men revving their engines at each other instead of talking or the elaborately choreographed entrances Smokes gang makes on its armada of phallic symbols. ""Biker Boyz"" is an irony-free world where honor Oedipal urges and the impulses and anxieties of male bonding all crash together at 120 mph -- and miraculously nobody gets hurt. (""You know what we call bikers in the emergency room?"" Kids mother frantically asks him when she discovers hes been racing. ""Organ donors."") In fact the bikers slang for the streets they race on is ""the set"" which seems appropriate for a world in which performance and posturing are just as important as skills. It will all look pretty ridiculous to grown-ups but to 13-year-old boys (and adults with well-tended inner versions thereof) ""Biker Boyz"" will be the perfect testosterone-fueled flash-edited music-driven joy ride. If turnabouts fair play Queen Latifah should be looking over a ""Biker Girlz"" script right now. Vroom vroom Biker Boyz (90 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for violence sexual content and language.

W. Nevius Carla Meyer Published 400 am Friday January 31 2003 BIKER BOYZ Action drama. Starring Laurence Fishburne Derek Luke and Kid Rock. Directed and co-written by Reggie Rock Bythewood. Co-written by Craig Fernandez. (Rated PG-13. 111 minutes. At AMC Kabuki AMC Van Ness Metreon Century 20 Daly City and Century Plaza 10.) It takes some work to make 100-mph motorcycle races boring but theyve managed to pull it off here. Honest one more race -- good guy pulls ahead bad guy pulls ahead a shot of their eyes inside the helmet good guy wins by inches -- and everyone in the theater would have dozed off. The obvious idea is to stage a motorcycle version of ""The Fast and the Furious."" Instead we get the flat and the tedious. It would help if any of us cared about the basic premise. The idea is that Smoke (Laurence Fishburne) is an aging street racer who owns the mythical title of King of Cali (as in California). Theres no trophy with the crown no money not even an appearance on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live."" Hes just King of Cali. Other bikers we are supposed to believe are obsessed with taking Smokes crown. It all leads up to -- surprise -- a big race with a cocky young up-and- comer (Derek Luke from ""Antwone Fisher"") who has issues with Smoke. Theres nothing wrong with a little mindless motorcycle fun but this pileup hits all the wrong notes. Smokes motorcycle gang the Black Knights is supposed to be savage and ferocious. But when the bikers pull up at the big race they stop in a neat single file hop off their bikes and snap down their kickstands in unison. Youve seen scarier marching bands -- especially Stanfords. Smoke has the most powerful bike in Cali and from the look of Fishburne who has added more than a few pounds he needs it. For some reason the King of Calis ride is done up in pink curlicues and Smoke looks as if he is riding the worlds fastest couch. Fishburne is stuck with lines like ""Black Knights lets roll."" Cmon Larry. Youve been nominated for an Academy Award (""Whats Love Got to Do With It""). Youve done Shakespeare (""Othello""). Youve won a Tony award. What are you doing riding this turkey? Kid Rock is given nothing to do and handles it perfectly. Luke has a definite presence but years from now when we are talking about his career this movie will not come up. Hes a kid -- named Kid -- who dreams of being King of Cali so he can make his girlfriend Tina (Meagan Good) a tattoo artist proud of him. Or something. Kid has Tina tattoo ""Burn rubber not your soul"" on his chest. That phrase comes up more than once in the movie spoken in hushed tones as if it explains everything. What is really needed is some slam-bang biker action but it is just the same whining engines over and over. The races are just one long side-by-side straightaway so once weve seen the bikes checked the speedometer and looked at the drivers eyes theres nothing to do but go through the check list again. - This film contains graphic violence foul language drug use. -- C.W. Nevius LOVE LIZA Drama. Starring Philip Seymour Hoffman and Kathy Bates. Directed by Todd Louiso. Written by Gordy Hoffman. (Rated R. 90 minutes. At the Lumiere Aquarius in Palo Alto Marin in Sausalito and Camera in San Jose. ) . Devastated by his wifes suicide Web designer Wilson Joel returns from her funeral to find a suicide letter. He carries it in his pocket and takes it along on an extended car trip but instead of opening it and examining what went wrong he keeps it intact as he slides into a vast depression. So begins ""Love Liza"" a downbeat but oddly affectionate tale that marks the directing debut of actor Todd Louiso (""High Fidelity"") and offers another great performance from Philip Seymour Hoffman the ace character actor of ""Happiness"" ""Magnolia"" and ""Boogie Nights."" His brother Gordy Hoffman wrote the script which won a screenwriting award at last years Sundance Film Festival. The acting Hoffman brother is expert at playing desperate men at finding their raw emotional root and making them sympathetic despite their pathology. He gives them a humanity that doesnt highlight their affliction so much as place it in a context that allows us to see the whole person -- to imagine who they were before things went wrong. Such is the case with Wilson Joel a grieving man who unable to cope with his tragedy starts sniffing gasoline and flying remote-control planes to escape. Friends try to help his supervisor (Sarah Koskoff) confuses him by taking him to the zoo and making a pass and his mother-in-law (Kathy Bates) badgers him into opening the suicide letter. Louisos direction is quiet respectful focusing completely on the performances and allowing the actors a wide berth of expression and behavior. Oddly the film isnt nearly as downbeat as it sounds but strikes a tone thats alternately melancholic hopeful and strangely funny. Thats a thin line to ride but Hoffman a master of his craft manages it beautifully. - This film contains raw language and drug use. -- Edward Guthmann LOST IN LA MANCHA Documentary. Directed by Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe. (Rated R. 89 minutes. At the Bridge Shattuck in Berkeley Rafael Film Center in San Rafael and Towne in San Jose.) . Brilliant brave and foolhardy Terry Gilliam is the perfect filmmaker to tackle ""Don Quixote"" the classic Miguel Cervantes novel of an enchanted madman charging against windmills. Dubbed Captain Chaos by one of his colleagues Gilliam thrives on panic and adversity. ""If its easy I dont do it"" he admits. ""If its impossible Ill have a go at it."" ""Lost in La Mancha"" a fascinating documentary by Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe captures one of the wildest most heartbreaking episodes in Gilliams career. In September 2000 he went to Spain to shoot ""The Man Who Killed Don Quixote"" a comic fantasy about a cynical ad man (Johnny Depp) who time- travels to the 17th century there to meet the insane Don Quixote (French actor Jean Rochefort). Gilliam whose resume includes ""Brazil"" ""Time Bandits"" and ""The Fisher King"" had been developing ""Quixote"" for nearly a decade. As soon as production began everything went awry floods thunder noise from a nearby NATO bombing range absentee actors and a herniated disk and prostate problems for the 70-year-old Rochefort. As a result the movie never got made. Grinning through his despair Gilliam rallies manufactures new levels of pluck and courage -- and essentially becomes the valiant dreamer hes trying to portray. Fulton and Pepe capture the mounting calamities -- Gilliam apparently gave them unlimited access -- and illustrate the saga with animated vignettes that portray Gilliam as a gonzo lunatic all teeth and bulging eyes driving madly through the desert. Ones sympathy falls easily to Gilliam who despite a penchant for punishment comes off as cheerful committed and good-hearted. ""Quixote struck me more powerfully as I reached middle age"" Gilliam says. ""He had one last chance to make the world as interesting as he dreams it to be."" - This film contains raw language. -- Edward Guthmann SHANGHAI GHETTO Documentary. Directed by Dana Janklowicz-Mann and Amir Mann. (Not rated. 85 minutes. At the Opera Plaza Shattuck in Berkeley and Rafael Film Center). . European Jews seeking to escape from the Nazis in the late 1930s found most Western countries -- including the United States -- closed to them. About 20 000 of them took refuge in an unlikely place a section of Shanghai that because of an immigration loophole related to the Japanese occupation didnt require visas. ""Shanghai Ghetto"" directed by Dana Janklowicz-Mann and Amir Mann sheds light on this fascinating piece of World War II history. Consisting mostly of talking-head interviews the film isnt especially dynamic but it brims with insightful poignant memories from survivors. In place of the persecution theyd escaped refugees found generosity and graciousness in China. An existing group of British Jews wealthy from Shanghais trading boom built soup kitchens for the newcomers. Their Chinese neighbors also accepted the refugees which was remarkable given that the influx of Jews had displaced thousands of native Shanghai residents who were even poorer than the refugees. Cooperation was crucial however because the Chinese and Europeans had to coexist in a space of about one square mile. Conditions were brutal with rampant disease and raw sewage in the streets. ""It smelled not like Chanel No. 5"" recalls a refugee. Anecdotes from survivors and historians give a sense of suddenly changed fortunes. In those days passage to Shanghai was available only via luxury liner; once aboard mothers advised kids to stuff themselves on gourmet fare knowing that they might go hungry once in China. Survivor Harold Janklowicz father of director Janklowicz-Mann brings great intimacy to his appearances maybe because hes being filmed by his daughter. He seems always on the verge of tears especially when recalling a kind British teacher who brought pupils to her home on weekends offering a respite from their sorry living conditions. ""She was a beautiful woman"" Janklowicz says choking up. Once Japan aligned with Germany the refugees British benefactors were interned and food became scarcer. The Shanghai Jews later endured a deadly Allied bombing aimed at a Japanese radio station. But after the war when they learned what happened to relatives in Europe the refugees saw Shanghai in a new light as a relative paradise. -- Carla Meyer Most Popular 1 Dear Abby I want to contact mistress from 45 years ago 2 Iceland man says Donald Trumps son left white powder at... 3 7-year-old girl dies after elephant at zoo throws a rock at her 4 Bikini-clad Swedish cop makes arrest while sunbathing 5 Clinton speech draws mixed reaction on cable news 6 Police Girl 14 slits teens throat in hope of first kill 7 Trump Jr. accuses Obama of plagiarizing a line from his speech 8 Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed 9 The Latest Trump slams Clinton over radical Islam 10 Ann Coulter Hammered by Conservatives for Smearing US War...

Without a clear destination all the sound and fury is as useless as burnt rubber. Laurence Fishburne plays a biker boss in Biker Boyz a mega-powered machine with nowhere to go. Those who like the sound of cycles revving and are content with ho-hum racing action will be satisfied but if a credible plot and compelling characters are on your wish list this movie sadly disappoints. Sadder still is the wasted talent of such top-notch actors as Laurence Fishburne Antwone Fishers Derek Luke and Amistads Djimon Hounsou. Orlando Jones so effective as the taciturn band conductor in Drumline is also underused. Of all the actors Luke fares best. As in Fisher his character possesses a potent combination of coiled anger and boyish charm. Too bad his dialogue is so cliched and predictable. The story is based on real-life African-American motorcycle clubs in Los Angeles and centers on Smoke (Fishburne) the head of a huge group and dubbed ""the king of Cali."" Lisa Bonet plays Queenie but we dont see the riding prowess that would merit such a title. (Most of the time Bonet sits on her super-charged bike looking cool and tossing her hair.) Review of the movie Biker Boyz ( out of four) Stars Laurence Fishburne Derek Luke Orlando Jones Lisa Bonet Director Reggie Rock Blythewood Distributor DreamWorks Rating PG-13 for violence sexual content and language Opens Friday nationwide The implication is that many of the men in these clubs are middle-class white-collar workers -- Jones is a lawyer -- who trade their daytime suits for the leather and helmets of nighttime street races. Anyone who ever has been to Los Angeles will marvel at the number of deserted streets and highways where these racers converge. Kid (Luke) loses his father who was Smokes devoted mechanic in a street race. Spurred by rage and grief he challenges Smoke in a race. In order to prove himself worthy of challenging the ""king"" he must race against Dogg. (Dogg is played by Kid Rock who is so lackluster as to seem almost shell-shocked. Eminem need not feel threatened.) The hip-hop Ramp;B soundtrack is one of the movies few assets though swelling orchestral music during a climactic race seems seriously out of place. The movie might have benefited from more glimpses of these characters lives by day as contrasted with their daredevil personas by night. It also could have used less soap opera and more real drama. Though its only 90 minutes the film drags making these not-so-easy riders pretty tough to watch.

Though it would seem an ideal follow-up in ""The Fast and the Furious"" this account of competitive clubs of street-racing motorcyclists doesnt approach that films seductive kinetic excitement and the allure of pure danger. Timid about pushing the action pic envelope and uncertain of tone ""Biker Boyz"" never really busts out of second gear. Though it would seem an ideal follow-up in the high-octane trend set by ""The Fast and the Furious"" this account of competitive clubs of street-racing motorcyclists doesnt approach that films seductive combination of kinetic excitement and the allure of pure danger. Two-wheeler fans are sure to make a pit-stop but the only crowd likely to sustain pic in theaters past a few weeks are fans of the impressive roster of (mostly) young African American talent topped by a solid Laurence Fishburne as the senior in the crowd. Director Reggie Rock Bythewoods taste for developing personal dramas as evidenced in his HBO drama ""Dancing in September"" asserts itself in scenes of off-track relationships but the rather formulaic handling of these matters clashes with the desire to make a fast-paced streets-themed sports movie. A looser third kind of pic emerges in a few buddy scenes that suggests a more promising direction the project -- fictionalized from a report by New Times writer Michael Gougis -- might have taken. First impression though is pure fun a sort of ""Warriors""-gone-Honda as a nighttime street race is anticipated between a young upstart and Smoke the so-called ""King of Cali"" (Fishburne). The scene is as much a dance party as a race but when Smokes Black Knights club arrives with military precision its clear where the priorities are. Smokes trusted mechanic (an uncredited Eriq LaSalle) plays father to wannabe racer Kid (Derek Luke) whos itching to race Smoke himself. Theres a pleasingly theatrical feel to the opening sequence both observing the many rituals of street racing (winner gets the helmet -- this illegal sports equivalent of the Masters Green Jacket) and the lineup of additional actors strutting through Orlando Jones as the Black Knights rhyme-spouting troubadour Soul Train; Djimon Hounsou as chief of the Soul Brothers club Motherland; Lisa Bonet as Queenie a blowsy biker chick and Smokes eventual love interest; Larenz Tate as Wood a cocky member of the Strays club; and Kid Rock cutting a strong profile as the Strays leader Dogg. When the race leads to a tragic end that sends Kid into a six-month mourning period away from the bikes his mother Anita (Vanessa Bell Calloway in pics best perf by a mile) hopes it will cool the young mans urge for racing. But Kid drifts back to the scene attracted by the good-looking tattoo artist Tina (Meagan Good) whos Woods sister. His sudden intrusion into a race involving Stuntman (Brendan Fehr) shows Kids moxie and lack of good judgement -- always essential ingredients in the racing-movie hero -- but plays as contrived. Still this leads to some multiracial bonding between Kid the Anglo Stuntman and Primo (Rick Gonzalez) a young Latino biker who proposes the trio form a club. Though the deliberate P.C. multiculturalism of this founding of the Biker Boyz is mannered the relaxed handling of these guys scenes feels like the closest the movie ever gets to the reality of street culture. Theres a funny contrast to this looseness and Bythewoods stark staging of the official sanctioning of the club by the bikers association which appears to be taking place in some kind of lower-depths dungeon. Significantly less dramatically engaging are the developing love affair between Kid and Tina and Anitas inevitable discovery that Kid is back racing again leading her to drop the bomb on Smoke that he is Kids real father. This conflict finally gives Fishburne something to play with but scripts handling of the revelations and the staging of other emotional explosions is straight out of B-mellers. Moreover the pattern of son confronting and surpassing father is familiar and ""Biker Boyz"" doesnt advance the conceit. Whats most surprising is how little Bythewood invests in making the races themselves truly gripping mini-movies along the lines auds now expect. Camerawork other than an occasionally sneaky roving view from just above the asphalt level never pulls off any dazzling or unprecedented angles and perspectives but stunt coordinator Gary M. Hymes team is astonishing (with actors doing some actual riding). Fishburne is his reliably commanding self. Luke displays a bit more friction and spark than he was permitted in the bland ""Antwone Fisher"" but hes stuck in a role saddled with too many B-pic conventions. Upstaging many better known thesps Calloway takes over every scene shes in while Fehr best exudes the movies interest in young mens drive to win. Though his appearances are kept to a minimum rocker-turned-thesp Rock looks and sounds terrific. Others such as Jones Hounsou Bonet and Tate are wasted in unfocused or marginal roles. The physical challenges in the filming come through on screen but lenser Gregory Gardiner delivers only moderately interesting visuals. What little sex is on view in this PG-13 vehicle is in Rita D. McGhees costumes. Camara Kambons score is pleasantly short on hip-hop and long on big guitar riffs. Biker BoyzProductionA DreamWorks release of an 3 Arts production.

Consider the way that it lends its heros standard nickname a tart dramatic resonance. Derek Luke the intense young star of ""Antwone Fisher"" sports a shaved head and a look of troubled sleekness to play the loyal and earnest Jaleel who has lost his father in a freak racing accident. The moment Jaleel appears in the back-alley biker world riding forth on his souped-up chopper hes Kid a daredevil with an outsize desire to establish his manhood. Luke a terrific actor never lets you forget that Kid in his moody bluster really is a kid or that hes trying far too hard to prove something. The director Reggie Rock Bythewood knows how to shoot the works but for all of the routine gear shifts in ""Biker Boyz"" he gets the drama working too so that theres something at stake in each of the races. In order to earn the right to compete Kid forms his own motorcycle club the multi-ethnic Biker Boyz and then spends the rest of the film trying to win a race with Smoke (Laurence Fishburne) a midde-aged speedster king whos at once his rival and role model. The great Fishburne is a wizard at conjuring mystique whether hes staring down the upstart Kid or eating Kid Rock as a scrungy fellow racer for breakfast.
