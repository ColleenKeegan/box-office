Comments click to enlarge Taken 3 Video Rated PG-13  109 minutes  2015 In this second sequel to Taken (2008) Liam Neesons ex-CIA operative tries to evade the LAPD while hunting down a man whos framed him for murder. Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen who wrote the first two movies lift most of this one from The Fugitive (1993) right down to the relationship between Neeson and the maverick lawman on his tail. Playing the latter character Forest Whitaker turns in one of his sleepiest performances; no one else seems to be trying very hard either yet director Olivier Megaton delivers some good chases fist fights and shots of Neeson looking glum.

"Swerve and Protect Wanting More From Blackhat Taken 3 and The Wedding Ringer << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Swerve and Protect Wanting More From Blackhat Taken 3 and The Wedding Ringer Universal Pictures Movies January 16 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Michael Manns Blackhat is a paranoia thriller that treats computer code the way most movies treat serial killers. In the opening minutes the camera surfs along cables weaves between chips pinballs amid circuitry. Its interested in everything screens of numbers blips pulses and lasers. Mann is trying to personify information to give it a point of view the way The Silence of the Lambs plunked you down in the basement lair of Buffalo Bill. The movie isnt as visually or psychologically arresting but it has a decent ludicrousness and Manns one-of-a-kind talent for using digital photography and naturalistic light to complicate and invigorate anonymous spaces. Lots of non-science fiction thrillers are ultimately about the fear of advancing technology. Theyre not sci-fi because science has already run amok. There are hackers. There is government and corporate spying. And it doesnt take much for computer networks and surveillance systems (or their anonymous human exponents) to come chasing after you. That was the sickening allure of everything from Francis Ford Coppolas The Conversation (with Gene Hackman as a genius eavesdropper) and John Badhams WarGames to Tony Scotts Enemy of the State and Laura Poitrass Citizenfour It might already be too late. For about 10 minutes Blackhat generates intrigue in part by showing us the technology doing its psychotic thing. All that fiber-optic coursing culminates in an explosion at a Chinese nuclear reactor. Then we see the blips and cables and pulses reach the claw of a chip and soy futures soar through the roof. Soon were hopscotching between a pair of FBI agents Barrett and Pollack (played by Viola Davis and John Ortiz respectively); and Chen (Wang Leehom) an MIT-educated Chinese cyber-criminologist and his old classmate Nick (Chris Hemsworth) who for reasons known only to a Hollywood movie needs to be sprung from prison to help solve this case. ""So good to see you bro"" says Chen during a long embrace with Nick that Agent Barrett and Chens hacker sister (Tang Wei) are parked outside the prison to witness. Nick had been in the middle of serving a 15-year sentence for stealing millions from four big banks. But someones using a sloppy version of code he wrote to commit seemingly unrelated acts of terrorism and sabotage. As a deal to help solve the case he wants his sentence commuted. The script is credited to Morgan Davis Foehl and at this point he had me. Wheres this going? For one thing into the land of compujargon. Theres talk of edge routers and optical overlay networks. Among the Chinese theres bad dubbing and elsewhere dull exploratory excursions. And while Barrett and Chen work angles on their side of the film Nick and the sister wind up working each others angles. (To be fair hed been in prison for a minute.) But this of course turns a film about cybercrime into a film at least partially about fucking hackers. What you realize as theyre gazing at each other and as you watch their lovemaking is that these two are terrible together. Tang is lost in her many English-speaking scenes presumably having been hired for the sex she had in Ang Lees Lust Caution. Theres often little more for her to do than stare at the top of Hemsworths head as he hacks hunkily away in a dingy flat. But you start to doubt a movie that gives this much screen time to an actress whos that in over her head when in Davis theres a star on the other side of the movie exuding cool control. And what if she and Hemsworth had switched parts? Because while the movies -- and People magazine -- believe in Hemsworths sexiness falling for it is a kind of false worship. He walks around with shirts open to the middle of his chest as though he were James Caan in 1973. But Caan had the cockiness (OK gall) to open his to his navel. Hemsworth is missing that kind of gumption. Hes got an empty smolder like a grill after youve dumped out the coals. But it turns out that when he isnt forced to be concerned with sex when the movie lets him charge ahead with the narrative he becomes sexy in a young Jan-Michael Vincent sort of way. When Hemsworth finally puts all the plot pieces together (thank you screenplay) hes standing well above sea level speaking to no one in whatever accent hes decided to give himself ""Thats what youre doing isnt it you son of a bitch?"" By this point the movie has turned into something ripe and pulpy. Nick breaks into the NSAs system. And later when he does more pivotal hacking youll never guess the color of his baseball cap. You come to appreciate the films fondness for Nicks criminality even as it baffles (if the hat fits I guess). By that point Mann has already staged one shootout at a dockyard among shipping containers and another on an empty street at night (the veteran Holt McCallany plays the U.S. Marshal on the FBIs team; hes got the sort of unfussy masculinity Manns movies thrive on). These sequences arent Heat-caliber. But Mann puts his foot in them anyway lingering with love over the face of one dead character and letting the sound guys leave you feeling as though youve been riddled with bullets too. The whole thing culminates in an excitingly done increasingly despicable nighttime showdown at a Jakarta street festival whose vastness seems meant to hide its participants from each other. We never see the faces of the marchers but when a melee inevitably erupts and the knives and guns come out the marchers are shoved in and out of the way. Theyre made disposable for our entertainment. The movie has long given up on giving technology a point of view and turns rather suddenly into another asinine occasion to bulldoze a culture that has no point of view in Hollywood.  Sam Urdank/Europacorp I guess theres no point in asking who wants another Taken sequel. By a wide margin the latest and allegedly last installment -- Taken 3 -- is no. 1 at the box office. Volume 2 set largely in Istanbul made a wishful rooftop leap into the Bourne movies but crashed through a window into a bad 24 plot. Having Liam Neesons CIA operative hell-bent on revenge Bryan Mills team up with a blonde nincompoop daughter named Kim (Maggie Grace) only enhanced the TV comparison. But oh the magical shenanigans of Taken 2 It warranted a space in the dumb action hall of fame. (Heres an incomplete transcript of a jailed Mills stealing a cell-phone call to Kim ""Take a shoelace from one of my shoes in the closet ... Draw another circle with the market in the center ... I want you to go to the parking lot with the grenade ... I want you to pull the pin on the grenade ... Now I want you to draw a circle on the map ... I want you to take one of the guns and two of the grenades and go up to the roof ... Set off another grenade ... Drop the gun down the vent Kim and run ... "") Well Kim runs into part three a movie that thinks the way to earn our knuckle-biting is to be as dull as hell for 35 minutes then send a giant shipping container hurtling along the interstate. But you yawn through that too. Its all brought to you by the same outfit that made the first two Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen on script with Olivier Megaton directing. This being a Besson production it attains some lunacy but hardly anything comparable to Taken 2 which had lost the antsy defensiveness of the ludicrous first movie a story of a divorced dad trying to reassert his fatherly primacy with karate chops swinging kicks and action doubles. After all that its honestly surprising theres anything left to take. Alas however he arrives from a jog to his Los Angeles apartment one morning only to find the dead body of his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen). But she just texted him a bagel order Of course the cops think Bryan did it. Of course Bryan runs. Of course the detective on the case is Forest Whitaker who fiddles with such props as rubber bands and discarded chess pieces (its a knight and it takes nothing). Whenever Bryan gets close to Kim whos distraught over her mother worried for her father and expecting Whitaker gets a feeling and goes nuts and orders the officers hes got surveilling Kim to get after her. At this point you could stay home and fire up The Fugitive. The plot hides amid a bonanza of convenience-store trips diner scenes and lots of shots of bagels. It does so while climbing a ladder of nonsense that leads to the sort of ugly-looking Russian goon who in anticipation of a business deal actually makes time for gross hot-tub nuzzling with two ladies. Never fear -- with these movies the ladder always has another rung. But its also the kind of film that telegraphs what that rung is long before any sort of climax gets going. All the exceptional stunt work of the first movie and action orchestration of the second are an uninspired mess of visual incoherence. When Bryan and his car are run over the side of a cliff you can set your watch for the flashback that explains his escape. Neeson owns these movies and this new bad-ass phase of his career. Other middle-aged stars have followed suit with suave turns in kill-everybody action thrillers -- Kevin Costner Denzel Washington and soon Sean Penn. Neeson gives his incarnation heartache and loneliness. He performs. His intolerance for the execrable extends from the characters to the actors playing them. Dougray Scott plays Lenores husband Stuart and before getting to the Russians Bryan leaves himself no choice but to waterboard Stuart. As bad as Scott is (hes not even winking) this is excessive and as the Senate Intelligence Committees recent torture report confirmed not terribly effective. (Again so many rungs.) Neeson looks good. He just doesnt look fast. Bryans escape from the LAPD by foot and by fence-scaling constitutes satire. This is one of the most hectically edited movies Ive ever seen (I dont think theres an action shot that exceeds three seconds). But the cutting cant disguise Neesons slowness. American law enforcement has been under a lot of stress and scrutiny lately. But failing to catch a big-ass 62-year-old Irish dude running through alleyways and living rooms will only add insult to injury.  Matt Kennedy/Screen Gems A reliable authority swears to me that an algorithm didnt write the new Kevin Hart movie; humans did. But The Wedding Ringer feels spat out for people who love Katherine Heigl movies but wish that Eddie Murphy were in her role instead. Instead of mid-1980s Murphy though they get Hart who tries to do for this movie what Will Smith did for a similar matchmaking scenario in Hitch make it fizzy. Like Hitch The Wedding Ringer is all but stolen by the corpulent costar who needs a smooth black male to save him from haplessness (its Josh Gad now; then it was Kevin James). There are slabs of Wedding Crashers stabs at the painfully funny physicality of the Farrelly brothers something like the finale of The Graduate and the sort of approach to bromance that errs relentlessly -- though neither insultingly nor all that cluelessly -- on the side of gay. Harts Jimmy Callahan runs a business specializing in providing best-man services to friendless grooms. Gads character Doug calls on him 10 days before his wedding to a woman (Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting) who he feels is too hot for him. He has fewer friends than he has let on to her. But for 50000 (plus expenses) Jimmy pulls together a team of groomsmen and throws him a bachelor party. The short notice means the groomsmen are largely idiots and weirdos. One is a fat loser (Jorge Garcia). The Asian American one has a third testicle. Anothers a white sleazed-up ex-con (Colin Kane) who preys on women and has raped men. Doug is appalled but maybe these misfits (and criminals) are the bros hes always wanted. The number of soundtracked montages Doug and Jimmy share makes the average Heigl movie seem like Birdman. In the meantime they find themselves drawn to one other and each time they have a moment Jimmy has to redraw a professional line the way Julia Roberts kept telling Richard Gere she doesnt kiss johns on the mouth. Jeremy Garelick directed The Wedding Ringer from a script credited to him and to Jay Lavender and they seem scared of how much smarter this movie couldve been. The filmmakers unleash noisy party scenes sequences that appear to have been edited with a Vitamix and a basset hound that comes down with lockjaw while licking Gads penis. That last bit -- along with a couple of other nominally funny asides -- are intended to bring down the house. The wedding planner is an over-the-top gay queen (Ignacio Serricchio). At some point Dougs grandmother (Cloris Leachman) catches fire at a dinner table and nearly burns down the house. And Dougs coarse macho future father-in-law (Ken Howard) challenges Dougs masculinity by assembling a football team that includes Ed ""Too Tall"" Jones and a mad-dog Joe Namath. This is drive-thru comedy. The sugar grease and salt will make it a hit. But theres a far more interesting sophisticated work of cynical farce between the films two sesame-seeded buns. Olivia Thirlby plays the potential sister-in-law and the movie almost lets her do more than smell a rat in Jimmy. The same is true of Cuoco-Sweeting whose sense of comedic sharpness the film just gives up on. More than once this sham world that Jimmy inhabits keeps revealing funny new layers of fraud. The gay wedding planner pivots from one cliche to the invention of another because he surmises the clientele for his line of work demands it. The movie understands the lucrative value of stereotypes so thats all it peddles. Its all the producer Will Packer peddles too usually with Hart. The only moments that dont feel like a sham are the ones in which Hart and Gad are holding each other on the dance floor reclined in beach chairs reminiscing gently as water from a swimming pool shimmers over them or tongue-tied at the mutual intensity of their connection. I at least felt something. Harts best with a skeptical sparring partner -- like Alan Arkin or Regina Hall -- rather than on his own or with someone he can run all over. His comedy needs a speed limit and often a Kleenex. In song or in motion Gad could be a star. He and Hart are persuasively vulnerable together. This movie isnt uncomfortable with that but it interrupts the awwws -- or the ewwws if youre inclined to be that way -- with a lot of crassness. Maybe the hope is that you dont notice that the ""if you liked blank then youll like blank"" algorithm is sputtering as it attains a version of derivative untapped humanity If you liked Pretty Woman youll love when it pretends to be Bridesmaids.

Director Olivier Megaton even rewinds the second blast to show us how his hero escaped. It still doesnt make sense. But who cares. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Neeson is in top fighting form.The Taken franchise is rooted in implausibilities specifically that a 62-year-old Oscar winner is the baddest mofo on earth. Say what you will about the silliness of the series but Neeson has always played his ex-military man very seriously. His Bryan Mills is living a drama -- it just plays like a comedy. And Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamens script has fun with that contradiction. They may have written an aborted breakfast scene into the film just because Neeson sounds hilarious when he says ""bagel.""Film Details Taken 3 RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time103 min. More Info Trailer Taken 3 isnt brilliant but its a hell of a lot of dumb head-smacking fun. In an early scene Mills arrives at the doorstep of his hapless daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) with a giant stuffed panda -- the perfect gift from a dear old dad who thinks his baby is still 11. Hes in for a shock Kim is pregnant. If only Megaton had the courage to go sci-fi with Mills shrinking himself to a cell and slashing her boyfriends sperm. But women in Taken 3s world serve one purpose to be dragged away at gunpoint. Some tattooed Russians promptly offer to oblige.Neeson is in top fighting form not that you can appreciate his abs in the battle scenes as the camera plants itself so close to the action that you cant tell where anyone is and whose tibia theyre breaking. In what should have been a standout car chase with Neeson braking uselessly before an 18-wheeler Megaton frames the truck only two wheels at a time. With all the dangers as chopped up and unassuming as a house salad the big set pieces are merely a frenetic yawn. Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat.

After a character opts for a head-shot suicide the camera pans down to a fallen corpse thats as bloodless as a radish. At this point its almost an art-house joke on the cravenness of the MPAA ratings board.At least Los Angeles Mills home and the setting of our struggle looks great. The sun is golden and the city is well used from Malibu to downtown. As a bonus we finally get to pal around with Mills old military buddies still ribbing him about maybe rekindling things with his wife (Famke Janssen) on the golf course and ready to spring into action when he needs them. Which is of course soon. And which is of course bound to happen again and again. As Mills sighs to Kim ""I dont know how many times I can say sorry."" As long as there are audiences willing to eavesdrop on his apologies -- and enjoy his ass-kicking. Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

Credit Sam Urdank/20th Century Fox After ""Non-Stop"" ""Unknown"" and three installments of the ""Taken"" thrillers Im not sure that Liam Neesons signature avengers are actually good people to know. On the plus side theyll use any means necessary to rescue you from kidnappers and killers. But if youve been kidnapped or are facing death its probably directly related to knowing Mr. Neesons character in the first place or just being nearby.In ""Taken 3"" -- Olivier Megatons embarrassingly flat sequel about the retired government agent Bryan Mills (Mr. Neeson) -- the agents daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) and his former wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) run into grief yet again. One dies; the other cries; and it all has something to do with a pale Russian gangster (Sam Spruell) and the latest rich-jerk husband (Dougray Scott) to succeed Bryan.But theres little story to speak of beyond Mr. Neesons racing around fighting for the truth pursued by a Los Angeles detective (Forest Whitaker).A running fantasy of wronged divorced-dad nobility the series here continues its ritualized plot points. Mr. Neeson babies Kimmy with a childish gift and balks at some completely normal step in her adulthood. He has a barbecue with the fellas (also veterans of covert ops). He makes a very serious cellphone call or two announcing that someone is being taken or giving very clear directions. He becomes a righteous fugitive whose rampages (up to and including waterboarding) are rationalized through fatherhood.More important Mr. Megatons direction of action sequences borders on atrocious. Ragged camerawork and editing ruin freeway car chases and hand-to-hand combat alike. The logy screenplay by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen sags under head-clutchingly banal dramatic scenes. Only Mr. Neesons appeal somehow survives unscathed perhaps the most impressive stunt of all. Advertisement Continue reading the main story ""Taken 3"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

An ex-CIA agent avenges a murder. Director Olivier Megaton (149) PG-13 Violence language. Area theaters. Even Liam Neeson seems bored by the imbecilic repetitive ""Taken 3"" an action movie no one was clamoring for and no one will enjoy. Did anyone really wonder how Neesons growly ex-CIA agent Bryan Mills would react when bad guys get too close to his family yet again? No but viewers will wonder whats happening in the action scenes since director Olivier Megaton (dun-dun-dun is the proper reaction to that name) apparently filmed them all with a camera strapped to the head of a chicken. Then it was all edited together for maximum confusion by a chef at Benihana. In the first half though its all slow burn. Mills is an awkward dad -- again -- around his collegiate daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). Kim was taken by human traffickers in the 2008 original. Mills lopes back home to his modest L.A. motel apartment where hes visited by his ex-wife Kims mom Lenore (Famke Janssen). Lenore was taken by Albanian mobsters in 2012 sequel. Shes very unhappy with her new hubby the superwealthy Stuart (Dougray Scott playing it all as a smarm-fest). Too bad Mills doesnt have any relatives since ""Taken 3"" relies upon one of his immediate family members again getting abducted and being a victim of well lets just call it the Big Taken. A quirky but sharp police detective (Forest Whitaker) is on the case which seems to point to Mills as the culprit. But there are some shadowy Russian mobsters lurking about as Mills chases around L.A. only to discover the real villain is pretty close to home. L.A.? After the earlier films zipped around Paris and Istanbul respectively Megaton and cowriter/coproducer Luc ""Hack-a-ton"" Besson offer dingy familiar locales filmed in grungy Cheap-o-Scope. Dudes show some effort. Liam Neeson returns as Bryan Mills in Taken 3. (Photo Sam Urdank) Forest Whitaker (r.) also stars in Taken 3. (Daniel McFadden/M6 FILMS) Liam Neeson and Maggie Grace in Taken 3. (Daniel McFadden/M6 FILMS) That goes for Neeson as well. Actually if the often laughable ""Taken 3"" -- in which one man while talking to another man actually says ""Lets talk man-to-man as it were"" -- serves any purpose its to show how that there actually is a distinction to Neesons action flicks from the last 10 years. ""The Grey"" and ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" are up to snuff; ""The A-Team"" ""Taken 2"" and now ""Taken 3"" are low points. In fact with no one really left to kidnap and ticket prices being what they are here its the audience that gets taken. ON A MOBILE DEVICE? CLICK HERE TO WATCH THE TRAILER.

This time someone has murdered his wife (Famke Janssen) and framed him for it. Photo Credit 20th Century Fox / Daniel McFadden advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Former government operative Bryan Mills is in trouble again this time framed for the murder of his ex-wife. Rated PG-13. BOTTOM LINE Neesons late-life rebirth as an action star may be drawing to a close with this limping wheezing entry in the ""Taken"" franchise. CAST Liam Neeson Famke Janssen Maggie Grace LENGTH 149 Remember what a thrill it was to see Liam Neeson at the distinguished age of 55 use his imposing frame and actorly gravitas to become a gun-toting face-smashing CIA agent named Bryan Mills in 2009s ""Taken""? Essentially a third-rate Bruce Willis movie and making no apologies for it ""Taken"" had a threadbare plot -- Albanian sleazeballs kidnap Mills daughter -- but it also had fast-moving energy and hard-hitting violence. The 25 million cheapie took in 145 million at the box-office and transformed Neeson into a midlife action star. Two sequels later it seems neither Neeson nor his franchise creators -- producer Luc Besson and his co-writer Robert Mark Kamen -- has the stamina to continue. Ideas and energy were already dwindling in 2012s ""Taken 2"" (another locale another kidnapping) but all creativity has evaporated in ""Taken 3."" The tagline on the posters ""It Ends Here"" implies that its time to call it a night. advertisement | advertise on newsday But first the movie needs making. Heres what passes for a plot Two cops discover Mills hovering over his dead ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) with a bloody knife. Despite an obvious alibi -- he was just at a bagel store and has the warm bag to prove it -- the cops arrest Mills who knocks them out and flees. Los Angeles Police Detective Dotzler (Forest Whitaker) arrives on the crime scene and proves a sharp-eyed if unorthodox investigator. He eats the bagels. Neesons Mills is equally unimpressive. Instead of survival skills and training he relies on old CIA buddies (Leland Orser plays the tech maven Sam) who provide passcodes weapons and surveillance equipment. None of it much helps them pinpoint the real killer A blinged-out Russian mobster Malankov (Sam Spruell)? Or Lenores shady husband Stuart (Dougray Scott)? Maggie Grace as Mills daughter Kim once again takes the distressed damsel role. Returning director Olivier Megaton seems either distracted (the car-chase sequences are incoherent) or simply bored by the listless largely actionless material. The ""Taken"" franchise ends on a dispiriting note Its a third-rate Liam Neeson movie. 225 MoviesTaken 3 trailer Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

"Taken 3 should be called Mistaken 3 review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesTaken 3 should be called Mistaken 3 reviewTaken 3 is such a blatant paycheque gig for Liam Neeson you almost expect him to stop midmovie to deposit his loot into an ATM.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Jan. 9 2015Taken 3Starring Liam Neeson Maggie Grace Famke Janssen Forest Whitaker Dougray Scott and Sam Spruell. Directed by Olivier Megaton. At GTA theatres. 109 minutes. 14ATaken 3 is such a blatant paycheque gig for Liam Neeson you almost expect him to stop midmovie to deposit his loot into an ATM.Instead he careers around Los Angeles vainly trying to maintain velocity in an action-thriller franchise that was already wheezing to a halt with Taken 2 which was set in Istanbul. Article Continued BelowThat was back when the title actually made sense. In Taken 2 as in the surprise-hit 2008 original Taken set in Paris Neesons ex-CIA guy Bryan Mills employed his ""particular set of skills"" to rescue family members from badass foreign kidnappers.The family-snatch angle is little more than an after-thought in Taken 3 -- maybe they should have called it Mistaken? Taken 3 sees Liam Neeson again playing the action star.This means were denied the thrill of hearing Neeson make a truly threatening telephone call to the badasses which is as vital to the enjoyment of this series as hearing Dr. Evils ""one meellion dollars"" demand to world leaders in Austin Powers.Instead returning director Olivier Megaton writer/producer Luc Besson and co-writer Robert Mark Kamen go in for the framed-man plot and a whole lot of other hoary cliches to boot. No frequent-flyer miles were wasted making this film but a lot of brain cells certainly were.Mills is back home in Los Angeles still trying to be a good dad to his feisty daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) and a decent co-parent with his jittery ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) who has yet another new husband a slithery businessman named Stuart (Dougray Scott). Much is made of the predictability of Mills who always does clueless dad stuff like bringing a giant stuff panda as a birthday gift for his now-twentysomething daughter. Seems Kim too is also set in her ways which will feature into the creaking plot. Meanwhile Lenore has a recurring problem with finding a man she can happily cohabit with. Things arent going so well between her and Stu who has run afoul of a grinning Russian mobster named Oleg (Sam Spruell).All this talk about being predictable is meant as a tipoff that Taken 3 wont be so easy to suss but alas the reverse is true. Its obvious to the audience what is going on right from the get-go although it takes the good guys so long to catch up youll feel like shouting ""Duh"" at the screen when they finally do.When something very bad happens to Lenore Mills is falsely blamed and then hightails it as only he can. The LAPD and FBI set off in hot pursuit led by a detective (Forest Whitaker in a thankless role) who is like a cross between Colombo and Inspector Clouseau. Whitakers lawman Franck Dotzler spends much of the film munching and pondering a bag of warm bagels left at a crime scene while also playing cats cradle with a rubber band and fondling a chess piece all added in a desperate attempt to make his character interesting.It doesnt help the film and neither do the multiple car chases that play like a theme-park ride of action tropes shot with a fidgety hand-held camera that gets downright annoying.Mills and his pursuers race-by-numbers through crowded city streets perilous mountain roads (fall down go ""kaboom) and the winding turns of a parking garage.The films only bright spot is the presence of Neeson who manages to bring a measure of dignity to even his most craven of assignments and who at the age of 62 still looks far more convincing as an action hero than say Harrison Ford did at that age.Ill happily watch Neeson in almost anything. But its time for this particular franchise to call it a day before the rust really sets in on his ""particular set of skills.""The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

All Stories >> Related 10 Worst Movies of 2014 From a less-than-amazing Spiderman movie to brain-dead Bayhem we look back at the years cream of the cinematic crud At 62 Neeson still has a glare that means badass. Nothing else in Taken 3 makes a damn lick of sense. In the first Taken in 2008 Neesons killing machine massacred every goon in Paris to rescue his 17-year-old daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) from Albanian slave traders. In Taken 2 in 2012 pissed-off relatives of those Albanians captured Mills and his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) during a vacation in Istanbul. Sheesh. Why doesnt this Los Angeles family stay the fuck home? Silly question. With Mills retired to Enfamil slippers and C.S.I. reruns thered be no way to raid the box office and trade on audience affection for the first movie which was -- no lie -- a guilty gritty pleasure. But Taken 3 people goes past cashing into cynical exploitation. The new script by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen is empty of ideas fun and purpose. At least Mills is home in LA. this time trying to get things going again with Lenore now unhappily married to a wealthy suit (Dougray Scott). The triangle ends in a murder with Mills getting framed for the crime. Theres a lot of running around while Neeson pretends hes in a better movie The Fugitive and director Olivier Megaton edits frantically to compensate for the lack of anything really happening. Mills had skills once. No more. The only thing  getting taken this time is the audience.

"Review Taken 3s Liam Neeson fires up action and unintended laughs - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Taken 3s Liam Neeson fires up action and unintended laughs Taken 3 Sam Urdank / EUROPACORP The high-octane action thriller once again features Liam Neeson as the former black ops guy with all those particular skills intact. The high-octane action thriller once again features Liam Neeson as the former black ops guy with all those particular skills intact. (Sam Urdank / EUROPACORP) Betsy Sharkey Via BetsySharkey Megaton of action and Liam Neeson arent enough to keep Taken3 interesting ""Taken 3"" is so unintentionally hilarious I couldnt help but wonder -- do movie contracts carry a humiliation bonus clause these days?The high-octane action thriller once again features Liam Neeson as the former black ops guy with all those particular skills intact. But this time around the dramatics and dialogue are so laugh-out-loud funny that if there is a ""4"" -- despite the promises that ""3"" is the final chapter -- maybe it should be a straight-out satire. Everyone is back from the Turkish fiasco of ""Taken 2"" and enjoying the L.A. sunshine. Bryan Mills (Neeson) is so chill hes occasionally catching a round of golf with the buddies though rarely has anyone seemed so uncomfortable on the greens.Daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) who turned into quite the ninja warrior in ""2"" is in college now and living with a new boyfriend (Jonny Weston) whom Bryan can intimidate. ""Daddy dont shoot this one."" She opens the film looking at a positive pregnancy test. Lenore (Famke Janssen) Bryans ex and Kims mom drops by briefly to stoke the romantic flames and die which gets the action rolling. And we finally meet Stuart (Dougray Scott) the very rich husband Lenore was always complaining about. Director Olivier Megaton is also back desperately trying to live up to that last name.Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen writers with a decent idea when they started with ""Taken"" in 2008 -- kidnapped kid black-ops dad to the rescue -- return without much new to offer. Everything you see and hear on screen from the smallest bit to the biggest boom gets explained repeatedly. I exaggerate only slightly; its like an entire movie made for a remedial audience. Taken 3 Daniel McFadden / EUROPACORP Everyone is back from the Turkish fiasco of ""Taken 2"" and enjoying the L.A. sunshine and that includes Liam Neeson left and Forest Whitaker. Everyone is back from the Turkish fiasco of ""Taken 2"" and enjoying the L.A. sunshine and that includes Liam Neeson left and Forest Whitaker. (Daniel McFadden / EUROPACORP) For example early on Lenore and Bryan are chatting by phone about Kim and her rejection of a big stuffed panda (yes a big stuffed panda) that pop bought her. Hes heading back to his place to fix dinner he explains. Does she want to stop by he asks. No she says. But she does walking in to catch him chopping bell peppers grocery bags still on the counter. He looks up long pause ""I didnt think you were coming."" ""I decided to."" ""Im just making dinner."" Duh.Now Im sure Im not remembering the dialogue exactly but the point is that precious minutes are taken by an exchange one of many that merely states the obvious and restates what has already been said often using exactly the same words. Drop the excess and the script would shrink by half and so perhaps would the movies nearly two-hour running time. (The first one by comparison was a lean mean 93 minutes.) Shakespeare nerd Maggie Grace has been Taken by the action genre Susan King Liam Neeson and Maggie Grace have developed such a strong bond playing father and daughter in the blockbuster ""Taken"" franchise of action-thrillers that the two have become like family. ""The way he is with me and my family -- its so amazing and lovely"" Grace said. ""Every time I see him he asks... Liam Neeson and Maggie Grace have developed such a strong bond playing father and daughter in the blockbuster ""Taken"" franchise of action-thrillers that the two have become like family. ""The way he is with me and my family -- its so amazing and lovely"" Grace said. ""Every time I see him he asks... (Susan King) There are however two benefits to the technique. Quite often it plays like a punch line particularly when the dialogue is delivered as Bryan is pummeling someone. So theres the laugh factor. And at some point it becomes clear ""Taken 3"" does not require anything close to your full attention. Feel free to break that New Years resolution and go get that popcorn. You will miss absolutely nothing.The plot. Now this is a shocker People around Bryan are dying or in danger and hes ""going to find them."" The main crew is Russian led by a homicidal maniac with some major ink named Oleg (Sam Spruell). The issue is money a debts overdue. As much as Oleg loves collecting debts he loves his hand tattoo more. I know this because hes usually holding his hand very still even in the midst of a messy kidnapping so any security camera in the area can catch that distinctive black star.Complicating things and adding to the hilarity Bryans been framed for his ex-wifes murder and while hes hunting the real killers LAPD Inspector Franck Dotzler (Forest Whitaker) is hunting him. Dotzler is a rubber-band snapping cop who always gets his man. That is of course if Bryan doesnt get him first.Eventually the dust clears the bodies are buried dad and daughter have a moment. As the warm California sun sets on the former black ops guy with the particular skills lets just hope this is really goodbye.---------------------Taken 3MPAA rating PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action and for brief strong languageRunning time 1 hour 48 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Entertainment Taken (movie) Liam Neeson Reviews Forest Whitaker Maggie Grace Taken 3 Liam Neeson uses his Taken skills to help Maggie Grace Box office Liam Neesons Taken 3 launches with 1.6 million Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad71deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-taken3-liam-nesson-review-20150110-column.html,200,taken38,taken3,latimes

That is they offered some high-powered thrills and provided a fine showcase for Liam Neeson as a whispery bad-ass with a particular set of skills.""Taken 3"" is billed as the last entry in the series. Apparently its not a moment too soon for Neesons ex-CIA operative. The movie commits the deadliest sin for this type of project Its simply boring.This time around Neesons Bryan Mills is on the lam after being set up for the murder of his ex-wife (Famke Janssen). Hes also trying to track down the real killers and make sure his college-age daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) remains safe. In other words its just another day at the office for our sad-eyed hero.It could be a workable setup but things go wrong immediately. Theres too much empty-headed family drama floating around -- was there really a need for Kim to be pregnant? And although Bryans skill set always seemed a trifle implausible here he has turned into an escape artist who can vanish from a flaming car or a womens restroom with ease.Forest Whitaker plays the cop whos on his trail. Hes supposedly brilliant because he comes up with theories involving the kind of men who purchase warm bagels (theyre never killers). He also delivers dialogue about the brilliance of Bryan and his ex-CIA pals ""These guys could lose a tail if it was attached to a dog"" Has a real cop anywhere ever spoken like this?Still all kinds of problems are forgivable in a movie like this if the finished product is exciting. That doesnt happen here. Olivier Megaton (he helmed ""Taken 2"") starts things off at a sluggish pace and never picks up speed. Even the action scenes which often are filmed in jittery fashion dont generate thrills.Another annoying thing about the movie The title doesnt make sense as no characters are ""taken"" (i.e. kidnapped) in this one. The only things really taken by this movie are the 109 minutes of your life you wont be getting back.Taken 31.5 stars (out of 5) Director Olivier Megaton.Cast Liam Neeson Forest Whitaker Famke Janssen Maggie Grace Dougray Scott.Rating PG-13 for violence action and language.Reach the reporter at randy.cordovaarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849.

Liam Neeson (left) plays Bryan Mills and Forest Whitaker is the L.A. cop trying to bring him to justice in ""Taken 3."" Photo Daniel McFadden Taken 3 Likable not lovable Neeson action movie 1 / 4 Back to Gallery The ""Taken"" series is one of the more peculiar cinematic delights of the last half dozen years -- a guilty pleasure only for the guilty and ridiculous fun for everybody else. These movies work if you take them seriously and they work if you dont. But their appeal is more complicated than that If youre laughing you still get swept up; and if you get swept up you still end up laughing. The real mystery is whether the man at the center of the action Liam Neeson knows that these movies are partly hilarious. He must know and yet he never cracks never allows himself a knowing glance. Thats all-important because without Neesons full-throttle commitment -- without that sweet sincerity that can turn on a dime into homicidal rage and transform that gentle loping brontosaurus of a man into a rampaging Tyrannosaurus rex -- theres nothing there. He is the whole show. Thats especially the case with ""Taken 3."" For those keeping score In the first film sex traffickers kidnapped the daughter (Maggie Grace) of former CIA agent Bryan Mills (Neeson) in Paris. And so he had to go there and kill everybody in France. Then in ""Taken 2"" the same gang kidnapped his ex-wife (Famke Janssen) in Istanbul and he had to depopulate Turkey. So basically at the end of the last movie Bryan Mills had not only killed all his enemies but just about everybody whod ever looked at him cross-eyed. Thus the question was which way the series would go. Would they double down on absurdity and have a member of his family kidnapped again? (I was hoping for that for months.) Or would they take things in another direction? In ""Taken 3"" producer-screenwriter Luc Besson goes for the second option. ""Taken 3"" -- which was hidden from critics until it was too late for reviews to make the Friday papers -- is the most conventional of the series in that it breaks from the formula and adopts a more familiar action trope. This time Bryan is wanted for a crime he didnt commit. And so as he is trying to find the real criminal or real criminals or some really vast criminal network there is a cop (Forest Whitaker) trying to find him. This is slightly disappointing to all of us who hoped that Bryan might have had a cousin from Schenectady who got kidnapped -- a special cousin who saved him from drowning in ye olde pond back in the day and so this time its personal etc. But I cant blame Besson for trying something else and it bodes well for the series that he did. In any case ""Taken 3"" shows that it doesnt need the formula -- it needs Neeson -- and as long as it provides contexts in which this loving dad could be driven to waterboarding a guy the screenwriters are doing their job. However theres one thing from the previous ""Takens"" that the third installment absolutely should have retained the foreign location. Heres the problem. If hes in Istanbul he can practically level the city and then get on a plane and go home. But if hes in Los Angeles we know what he can get away with and thats not much. Theres a limit and Bryan Mills should be without limits. Along the same line the fact that hes being chased by cops specifically American cops inhibits his destructive capacity. Wiping out hordes of Albanian drug dealers is one thing. Shooting a foreign police detectives wife (""Taken"") is just fine. No consequences. But with the LAPD one must be more circumspect. Again carefulness is not a virtue we want Neeson or the character to cultivate. One of the weirdest things in ""Taken 3"" is that the movie replaces in the role of the ex-wifes current husband the more subtly objectionable Xander Berkeley with the overtly unwholesome Dougray Scott. Its all part of the move from idiosyncrasy to convention and in this case idiosyncrasy would have been better and more unexpected. And here its probably best I let you in on something. For the last several paragraphs Ive been trying to say something positive but each time I find myself getting dragged by honesty into slightly negative territory. I suppose Ive been trying to talk myself out of feeling disappointed about a movie Id been looking forward to for six months. But heres something positive. This is a pretty good action movie with the added kick of Neeson in the lead role. So there are moments of the appalling good humor that ""Taken"" fans thrive on. If you love the other ""Taken"" movies you will like this. But if youre determined to love it youll have to talk yourself into it -- and even then it might not work.

Movies Taken 3 by Kyle Anderson  KyleAEW Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Liam Nesson and Maggie Grace in Taken 3 (Daniel McFadden) B- Posted January 9 2015 -- 200 PM EST There is a moment roughly three-quarters of the way through Taken 3 where Bryan Mills the ex-CIA operative played by Liam Neeson tells one of the films reptilian villains that hes having a hard time figuring out the scheme that has forced him into action for a third time. Its entirely possible screenwriters Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen dropped it in there as a meta-joke for the audience. But even if it was it doesnt take away from the fact that tracking the plot of Taken 3 is more difficult than believing that the Mills family has luck this bad. The beauty of the first Taken was its simplicity--girl gets kidnapped commando dad springs into action and murders half of Paris. Even the inferior Taken 2 kept things tidy re-casting Neeson as the captured. This time around Neesons Mills is the prey having been framed for the murder of his wife Lenore (Famke Janssen). Hes being hunted by an ineffectual detective named Dotzler (Forest Whitaker) and trying to solve Lenores murder while also protecting oft-imperiled daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) from afar. Itd be totally reasonable if Taken 3 was simply about Neeson staying a half-step ahead of Whitaker but instead there are a series of convoluted double-crosses involving Kims shady stepdad Stuart (Dougray Scott) and Russian gangster Oleg Malankov (Sam Spruell). Add in Kims just-discovered pregnancy and youve got one swerve too many. But its a testament to Neesons startling charisma as an action star that for all its storytelling flaws large swaths of Taken 3 remain wildly entertaining. Though hes obviously been excellent as Oskar Schindler and Rob Roy these late-period Bronson-esque roles are the ones that really drive home what a skilled actor Neeson is. The dialogue in Taken 3 is pretty goofy sometimes but he sells it without looking as if hes trying to hard and his underlying devotion to his family is always lurking behind his eyes even as hes waterboarding dudes. The rest of the credit belongs to Megaton who masterfully constructs explosive set pieces. In addition to a pair of high-impact car chases theres also a clever fistfight in a liquor store and a siege on Malankovs high-security apartment all of which manage to balance blindingly kinetic action with a clear sense of geometry and choreography--you never lose track of where Neeson or his enemies are and what is at stake at all times. It lends Taken 3 a weight that doesnt exist on the page and helps it recover from its clunky first act. Its the weakest of the trilogy but Taken 3 kicks just hard enough to survive another day.

Even something as laughably inept as Taken 3. Movie mercenaries do not bother with good taste with money on the table. Taken 3 finishes off a trilogy featuring Neeson as an American ex-spy who repeatedly goes rogue to save members of his own family and himself from kidnappers thugs and psycho criminals. Taken (2008-09) was compelling. Taken 2 (2012) not so much. The promo poster for Taken 3 shouts ""It ends here."" We desperately hope that is true. This time around French writer-producer Luc Besson and his American co-writer Robert Mark Kamen change it up a bit. Taken took us to Paris; Taken 2 went to Istanbul; Taken 3 is set ""at home"" in Los Angeles (although this French-made movie was shot in Spain and France and only incidentally in California). But the premise is pretty much the same Mess with Neesons loved ones and you will die -- during or after a long series of on-foot and in-vehicle chases highway crashes gun fights hand-to-hand combat scenes and angry conversations spiked with bon mots in various languages. In Taken 3 Neesons Bryan Mills flirts with his ex-wife (Famke Janssen) but soon finds her dead in his bed in his L.A. apartment. He is framed for the crime. Maggie Grace returns as his daughter Kim who is once again in jeopardy. Dougray Scott plays her creepy step-dad Stuart St. John. Sam Spruell puts on a Russian accent and plenty of prison tattoos to play the arch villain Malankov. Forest Whitaker is the LAPD detective trying to solve the murder case while ignoring the fact that Neeson personally destroys half the city with his crash-em and kill-em antics. As for the performances acting in movies is difficult so nobody here bothers about it except Whitaker. With his quirks and thoughtful manner Whitaker seems to be in a different movie. Neeson knows better just going through the motions and spouting the idiotic dialogue that Besson and Kamen cooked up in English and Russian. Funny thing about the Cold War. In movies it never ended. Russians are currently the favourite villains for Hollywood and foreign wannabes making pseudo-American movies. The Russian ""problem"" -- with crime exported abroad as readily as vodka -- was brilliantly addressed in David Cronenbergs Eastern Promises. But movies such as Taken 3 just randomly populate the bad guy side with people whom American audiences love to hate. It is getting tiresome. Nevertheless Neeson executes a lot of Russians here but with none of the panache that Denzel Washington displayed in dispatching them in The Equalizer. The violence in Taken 3 is also neutered so fans of blood n guts will be bored. For that matter there is nothing worth noting in the work of the production team led by hack director Olivier Megaton (who also ruined Taken 2 and Transporter 3). Choppy editing chews scenes into tiny shards. Lacklustre visuals leave us yawning. A minimal effects budget provides no distractions. And the storytelling sucks. Taken 3 is just awful.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The neatest thing about Taken the French-made chase flick that launched the action-star phase of Liam Neesons career is the way it bundles together a whole lot of parental and urban fears then sublimates them into pummeling action. Its a movie of relentless and reckless momentum premised on a middle-age paranoid kooks worst case scenario.Taken 2 tried to one-up the originals ""kidnapped abroad"" setup but ended up producing something that only felt louder uglier and a lot less fun. Kudos to Taken 3 then for at least trying something new. Instead of rescuing a family member from Albanian mobsters in yet another world capital Bryan Mills--the throat-punching elbow-chopping ex-CIA operative most people think of as simply ""Liam Neeson""--finds himself framed for murder in L.A. Its a conventional riff on The Fugitive complete with Forest Whitaker in the Tommy Lee Jones role but at least its tapping into a set of fears and fantasies--about divorce and being replaced by a step-parent--that are distinct from those of the original. What makes Mills compelling--aside from Neesons performance naturally--is the fact that his cartoonish over-preparedness and ability to escape from any situation are rooted in anxiety. Hes the perfect father for a kid whos been kidnapped by armed thugs but over-protective and awkward otherwise--a fact that Taken 3 underscores when Mills who can effortlessly elude the best and brightest of the LAPD slumps over after learning that his now grown-up daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) is pregnant. Hes an invulnerable action hero for the same reasons why hes a difficult parent and partner. So what exactly is wrong with Taken 3? A lot of things most of which can be attributed to the fact that director Olivier Megaton--who also helmed Taken 2--couldnt mount an action scene if his life depended on it. Pierre Morel the cinematographer-turned-director behind the original Taken and the parkour flick District B13 at least had the good sense to move the camera with Neeson playing off of his size and heft to create momentum. Making good on his name Megaton takes the quantity-over-quality approach executing a flurry of cuts across as many sloppy angles as possible producing a gurgling brownish soup of photochemical textures and handheld jitters. This is the sort of movie where it takes a half-dozen shots for a man to jump over a fence. Its busy but lacks any sense of movement and is too visually monotonous to work on an abstract level. Because Mills hyper-competence never seems exciting it instead becomes giggle-inducing. While at this point co-writers Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen are clearly milking the characters tendency to speak in super-serious declaratives for intentional laughs (how else can one explain lines like ""I put something in the yogurt to make you nauseous"" and ""I have low blood sugar because I havent eaten since yesterday""?) its safe to presume that the high point of a sequence where Mills breaks into an LAPD garage isnt supposed to be the shot of our towering sixtysomething hero casually sliding out of the trunk of a car. Running a solid reel longer than either of its predecessors and featuring the worst car chase in recent memory the movie amounts to little more than generic action slop enlivened only by brief glimmers of intentional and unintentional comedy.

Neeson is framed for the crime and flees with the CIA FBI and police all in hot pursuit. VPCOur dauntless hero endangers hundreds as he leads police on elaborate chases though oddly the cars he smashes across Los Angeles freeways look devoid of drivers. He puts his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) in jeopardy with a daredevil collision as he slams the sleek Porsche hes stolen into an airplane shes been whisked onto.Lenores husband is a shady rich guy and hes got the fiendishly aristocratic name to prove it Stuart St. John (Dougray Scott). He figures into the mayhem as do acne-scarred Russians the go-to ethnicity for all things villainous in Hollywood.A credible action star and talented actor Neeson is fine in battle-scarred warrior mode but the cartoonish franchise has gone stale.How many more ways can filmmakers spin the concept of a retired CIA agent who jumps to the rescue of his endangered family? And how many more times can we watch a 62-year-old guy fend off legions of younger stronger bad guys and brawny cops while remaining bulletproof?This time around theres a protracted fight in a liquor store with booze spewing as bottles are broken. Its certainly more fun than watching Neeson wade through L.A. sewers as he throws cops off his trail. He hardly needs to go to all that trouble. Whether hes handcuffed in a patrol car pummeled incessantly run off a cliff or shot at by a team of well-armed mobsters he always escapes unscathed.""By now Im sure you know who I am"" Mills says over the phone to Sgt. Dotzler (Forest Whitaker) the detective in charge of the investigation. ""You know what Im capable of.""Oh we know we know. So is there any reason to show us again?Dotzlers police logic is a hoot He knew Mills was innocent because no one who buys warm bagels could turn to murder afterward. (He also eats some of the evidence which must violate some LAPD policy.)The final scene hints at where Taken 4 could go -- nowhere good -- despite this being touted as the last in the series.""Im going to finish this once and for all"" our hero declares.Promise? 99 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 20 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1BIIcg7",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/01/09/taken-3-review/21486979/,200,taken315,taken3,usatoday
"Taken 3 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; taken-3 ) Taken 3 (France 2015) January 09 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli Taken 3 is exactly what one might anticipate from an unnecessary sequel in a mediocre franchise. Even those desperate for a Liam Neeson action fix may be disappointed. The film directed like its immediate predecessor by Luc Besson disciple Olivier Megaton (with Besson co-writing and producing) has all the earmarks of a 1980s thriller. That means lots of unnecessary action fistfights shootouts car chases and the occasional explosion. The end result is that Taken 3 might have boasted a retro feel if it wasnt for the spastic editing used to obscure transitions between Liam Neeson and his body double. To be fair the movie isnt godawful or unwatchable; its just overlong tiresome and redundant. It also reminds us that despite some recent evidence to the contrary (The Raid 2 John Wick) the filmmaking industry hasnt entirely dispensed with mind-numbingly dumb action. It would be untrue to say I was disappointed by Taken 3. My expectations were low; it met them. An appeal of Liam Neeson in this series has always been that unlike many of his action contemporaries he is a respected and accomplished actor. Neeson is no Schwarzenegger flexing his biceps and struggling with the English language. Hes no hulking Stallone burdened by Rocky and Rambo. This is a man with an Oscar nomination and an impressive resume. He does these movies one would suspect for the paycheck. Taken 3 is the worst of the trio and Neeson is at his least invested. Sleepwalking might be an unfair way to characterize his performance but this certainly isnt an impassioned powerhouse portrayal. In fact after tragedy strikes early in the proceedings Neeson seems largely unmoved by circumstances and after a brief scene in which he composes himself he moves straight back into action-Neeson mode. Taken 3 transpires on American soil. Im not sure where the actual filming took place but the setting is Southern California and at least some of the scenes were shot on location. Events occur a number of years after Taken 2. Neesons Bryan Mills is amicably divorced from his wife Lenore (Famke Janssen in what amounts to a walk-on cameo) who has moved into a contentious marriage with millionaire Stuart St. John (Dougray Scott). His trouble-prone daughter (played with perfect whiney damsel-in-distress elan by Maggie Grace) Kim is pregnant with her boyfriends kid although she avoids telling Dad for fear that he wont handle the news well. One day Bryan arrives home with a bag of warm bagels in hand to find a dead body lying on his bed and the cops at the door. Never one to go along peacefully Bryan disarms the officers and takes off. While hes out running around trying to clear his name the detective in charge Franck Dotzler (Forest Whitaker) arrives on the scene and begins piecing together the truth and trying to stay no more than one step behind Bryan. Taken 3 like Taken before it borrows heavily from Hitchcock. In this case the plot device is one of the Master of Suspenses favorites The Wronged Man. In the previous two movies Bryan has been tasked with the mission of rescuing his family. This time around he is framed for murder and out to clear his name and bring the true miscreant to justice. Unfortunately this leads to what is easily the most threadbare of three credulity-straining narratives. The villain in Taken 3 is also the least menacing of the series. Brians guilt or innocence loses its importance as it becomes apparent that the police involvement in this story will have minimal relevance to how things are resolved. In fact when it comes to the cops their purpose seems limited to providing an action scene or two and bumping up the running time to well beyond 90 minutes. When Taken arrived on U.S. screens in the early days of 2009 I wrote the following ""The filmmakers approach is never to use a precision tool when a sledgehammer is available."" Nothing has changed. Neeson remains grim and taciturn. The action sequences while not ascending to the preposterous physics-defying levels of The Fast and the Furious movies are over-the-top. And the plot to the extent that is has any purpose at all exists to move Neeson and his co-stars from one set piece to the next. Taken 3 will satisfy a subset of action junkies a smaller subset of hard-core Neeson fans and absolutely no one else.

""Dadsploitation""? ""Father Kills Best""? I think I like my friend Matt Prigges description ""Peppy Fogey Fighting Romp."" Anyway 2008s Taken with Liam Neeson as an ex-CIA black-ops guy trying to save his daughter from Albanian sex traffickers could be said to have started it (or restarted it). But Taken 3 is bad enough that it may just end it. When we catch up to him this time Neesons Bryan Mills is happily buying a giant stuffed panda for his daughter Kims (Maggie Grace) birthday; he still thinks of her as a child even though shes now living with her boyfriend and secretly freaking out over a pregnancy test. Meanwhile Mills still has feelings for his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen who was given a bit more to do in Taken 2) whose marriage to sweaty wealthy businessman Stuart (Dougray Scott) may be falling apart. Could Bryan and Lenore wind up rekindling their romance? Well well never know because Lenore soon winds up dead in his bed and our hero is framed for the murder. (Im not giving anything away thats not in the trailer.) And theres your first problem. Whats made the Taken films sorta-kinda-maybe work in the past has been the way Millss over-the-top killing sprees have been driven by his tender obsessive concern for his family; those are the kinds of broad juxtapositions that writer/producer Luc Besson specializes in. Taken 3 unfortunately feeds less off Millss protectiveness -- his distinguishing character trait -- and more off a standard revenge-story setup crossed with a wan pseudo-Hitchcockian accused-man-tries-to-find-the-real-killers tale. Thats a very different thing and it actually calls for a different set of storytelling and filmmaking skills -- none of which appear to be in evidence here. Theres little urgency to the wrong-man plot since the film doesnt know what to do with the people chasing Mills. The police inspector who leads the manhunt Franck Dotzler (Forest Whitaker) seems uncertain about the mans guilt from the get-go. Or rather the film seems uncertain about Dotzlers uncertainty One minute hes determined that Mills is a menace; the next minute hes not all that concerned about catching him. When the two men face off briefly at one point and Mills protests his innocence Dotzler responds with some blather about how thats for the courts to decide. The scene may even be a nod to Tommy Lee Jones and Harrison Fords standoff in The Fugitive where Joness ""I dont care"" to Fords claims of innocence was a ruthlessly existential statement. But here the police have never felt like a threat and Dotzler has never felt like a character so the moment is pointless. Anyway the concept is lame and the execution is lame too. The more the film advances the less we care about the plot -- or anything that happens to anybody really. It doesnt help that the best character in these movies Janssens Lenore is already gone. Whitaker does his best with the little hes given but much of the supporting cast appears to have graduated from the never-stop-nodding school of acting. Neeson seems tired maybe because he himself doesnt even have that much to do character-wise. Mills doesnt even get to employ his particular set of skills all that much this time around except for one ridiculous scene where he gives his daughter a particular kind of nausea with a particular yogurt drink so that shell need to use a particular ladies room at a particularly opportune moment. (No really.) Other than that its a lot of chasing which could have been exciting except Taken 3 is mostly a waste as an action movie too. Director Olivier Megatons rapid-fire cutting is meant to bring some kinetic energy to the proceedings but this time around it comes across less as stylized frenzy and more as desperation. When you need ten shots just to show Liam Neeson clearing a fence the overall effect isnt ""Wow thats exciting"" but rather ""Wow Liam Neeson must be getting really old."" Alas there are many fences -- both literal and figurative ones -- that must be cleared in Taken 3 each one less impressive than the last.

Theres plenty of stupid on display in ""Taken 3"" but otherwise this dispiriting action movie - somehow simultaneously fidgety and flaccid - exists only to give Liam Neeson one more chance to play the role that made him ""Liam Neesons"" unlikely autumn-years action star. After seeing Neesons Bryan Mills lay waste to sex traffickers and the Albanian mafia in the two previous installments the filmmakers apparently felt hard-pressed to find a bad guy who could present a viable challenge to the seasoned CIA veteran. See video Taken 3 Star Liam Neeson Framed for Murder in Films First Trailer (Video) Returning screenwriters Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen and director Olivier Megaton didnt even bother instead pitting Mills against a gaggle of Russian mobsters so garishly stereotypical that they resemble the ""Opulence I has it"" guy from those old DirecTV commercials. Those cardboard cut-out villains are just one of the scripts many problems which also include dialogue so unwieldy that Neeson wrestles with it like a wad of chewing gum that still has the wrapper attached as well as a third-act twist so predictable and obvious that you keep waiting for the real twist to happen. This time around Mills life seems relatively calm while its his ex Lenore (Famke Janssen) whos got problems namely that her second marriage to Stuart (Dougray Scott) seems to be collapsing. She drops by Bryans place to cry on his shoulder and to make a pass (which Bryan gallantly deflects) only to have Stuart pop over later to ask Bryan to stay away from Lenore while they work on their marital issues. The next day Lenore winds up in Bryans bed with her throat cut and the cops arrive just in time to assume that Bryan is the culprit. He handily escapes the LAPD - who are with the exception of Dotzler (Forest Whitaker) presented as Keystone Kops - and sets out to find the real killer while also protecting daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) from becoming the next victim. Also read Taken 3 Reviews Critics Dont Think Third Times a Charm for Liam Neeson Thriller The idiocy and predictability of the plotting could be forgiven had ""Taken 3"" delivered the superior action sequences that audiences would expect but Megaton and editors Audrey Simonaud and Nicolas Trembasiewicz take every fist-fight shoot-out and highway chase and shred them into milliseconds of mismatched visual information like something out of a latter-day Godard movie. (At some point I wrote down ""a series of random concepts"" on my notepad and stopped trying to make any narrative sense out of these scenes.) Neeson who has brought his A-game to movies as silly as ""Non-Stop"" and ""Unknown"" cant seem to be bothered anymore; his smiley sympathetic banter with Janssen represents some of his least convincing screen work ""Battleship"" included. Whitaker snaps rubber bands and plays with chess pieces (hes the most tic-prone police inspector since Herbert Lom in the ""Pink Panther"" movies) Grace pouts and frets Scott twitches and glowers and ""Taken 3"" begins to feel like a cranked-out direct-to-DVD dud that somehow made its way to the big screen. Its such an incompetent production that the film opens with what may be the cinemas first unintentionally funny establishing shots (theyre swoopy and set to exaggerated doom music by Nathaniel Mechaly) and goes downhill from there. Also read Selma Has Awards Spotlight but Taken 3 Has Box-Office Guns Audiences the world over made Neeson an action star when they fell in love with his ""particular set of skills"" in the first ""Taken"" but this third go-round finds both cast and crew opting not to exercise any of them.

The only question was would writer-producer Luc Besson and director Olivier Megaton be happy just to coast along offering audiences another brainless cavalcade of shakycam action and growling macho nonsense? We catch up with ex-CIA operative Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) in yet another emotional tangle. Daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) is unexpectedly pregnant while ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) is falling out of love with her second husband (Dougray Scott) and slipping back into Bryans rugged orbit. Then a body is discovered Bryan is framed and the chase is on. Taken 3 scores over its predecessor on almost every level the stakes are higher the LA locations are nicely photographed and best of all theres an actual plot with twists and everything. The characters feel more rounded too. Neeson is still going through the motions but hes backed up by a solid crew of returning regulars and newcomers including Forest Whitaker as a likeably crumpled cop. Megatons epileptic herky-jerky action sequences are still frustratingly hard to follow and theres never a pretence that this is anything more than easy product for an undemanding audience. But in this series average is an improvement.

Its a cutesy touch that points to producer Luc Bessons ham-fisted attempt to introduce some variety into the latest entry in his money-raking franchise. Replacing the first two films simplistic man-on-the-run premise with a stuttering plot comparatively light on action and stuffed with red herrings and inconsequential characters (Forest Whitaker for one plays one of the most vacuous roles of his career) Bessons team has signed off the trilogy with a whimper rather than the kind of unfettered bang delivered by the first two films. That may compromise the movies performance at the box office as it unspools internationally (the first port of call being Hong Kong on Jan. 1) before reaching the U.S. on Jan. 9. Read more Tak3n Wants to Endorse Your ""Particular Set of Skills"" on LinkedIn Strangely Besson and his long-running series co-writer Robert Mark Kamen seem to have overlooked the one thing that made Taken and Taken 2 tick the appeal of leading man Neeson the anguished and aging action-hero who tries with solitary and superhuman effort to save his family. The franchises premise is slightly different from the very beginning as nobody gets abducted in Taken 3. Instead Mills hurtles across Los Angeles partly to evade lawmen wrongly convinced he has killed his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) and also to look for find and kill those who framed him of the murder. Those expecting Mills to tear around town like he did in Paris and Istanbul in the first two films will be disappointed -- apart from minor pyrotechnics in some buildings and a pile-up on the 710 Los Angeles is spared excessive mayhem. Thats because the flow of the action is repeatedly interrupted by Mills needless clandestine meet-ups with Kim and by sequences of Detective Franck Dotzler (Whitaker) either pondering the alleged murder while eating bagels or ordering around his underlings. These digressions deflate the tension that kept the first two Taken installments afloat as pieces of relentless high-octane spectacle; with Mills no longer dashing around as much the viewer has more time to be bothered by the implausibility and illogic of the narrative. Read more Lucy Helps Boost EuropaCorps First-Half Profit Visually Taken 3 offers more of the same. In line with the plethora of aerial shots that marked his first stab at the series in Taken 2 director Olivier Megaton basically deploys more of the same here. Somewhat incredibly the film even ends with the exact same Malibu Pier shot that concluded the previous film. While adept at bombastic action scenes the French director of Transporter 3 and Colombiana struggles to come up with imaginative ways to play out some of the drama the complicated plot calls for. Theres a notable lack of subtlety for instance in the crucial relationship between Kim and her stepfather Stuart (Dougray Scott replacing the considerably older Xander Berkeley from the first film) or in the hackneyed flashback sequence outlining the personal background of the films villain over-the-top Russian gangster Oleg Malankov (Sam Spruell). Compared to the first two entries Taken 3 has in some ways matured and mellowed with politically incorrect racial stereotypes that were flagrant in the earlier films no longer apparent this time around. If only the filmmakers could have conjured something more substantial to replace the gratuitous bone-crackers of yore. In any case theres a dangling thread here allowing for more future Mills-induced mayhem even if were told over and over that ""it ends here.""

Running out of kidnapped relatives for Liam Neesons ex-CIA killing machine to rescue scribes Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen turn him into a fugitive framed for murder in ""Taken 3"" a mind-numbing crash-bang misfire that abandons chic European capitals for the characters own backyard. French director Olivier Megaton who at least paced ""Taken 2"" with workmanlike efficiency executes the pedestrian plot without a shred of tension or finesse. Opening in Hong Kong on New Years Day a week ahead of its U.S. bow the Fox release will draw crowds simply because its supposedly the last installment of the lucrative franchise but theyll just be hostages to tedium. In ""Taken"" (2008) helmed by Pierre Morel Neesons Los Angeles-based Bryan Mills went after Albanian slave traders who kidnapped his 17-year-old daughter in Paris. Made as a low-budget B-movie that sent up U.S. politics and values even as it emulated American genre films it grossed 227 million worldwide. The sequel made four years later reversed the pattern by having the Albanians vengeful relatives kidnap Mills and his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen). Despite the more elaborate action setpieces and heightened casualties the premise remained just as basic and clear The shocking way in which the hostages are taken and the methodical manner in which the retired CIA agent tracked them generated tremendous excitement. Without someone to save the concept of a race against time is seriously weakened. While family matters were kept short and sweet in the other two installments ""Taken 3"" stretches out the kitchen-sink drama endlessly Mills daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) who was 17 when she was first kidnapped is now a college student facing serious adult problems. Her dad however still believes that after having hurled a few hand grenades and driven a stolen car through a shower of bullets shed still be content to play with a stuffed panda on her birthday. Equally troubled is Lenore who seeks consolation as her marriage to filthy-rich Stuart (Dougray Scott) is on the rocks. The possibility of Lenore and Mills rekindling their relationship is put on hold however when hes forced to go on the run for a crime he didnt commit. As he said to Lenore in the previous film ""Ill be OK. Its the people following me whore gonna have a problem."" Given that Mills walked away Scot-free from double-figure body counts in Europe watching him evade arrest by Inspector Frank Dotzler (Forest Whitaker) doesnt yield much in terms of suspense or surprises. Mills describes Dotzler as ""very clever"" though the latters theory that anyone who buys warm bagels cant be a cold-blooded killer ranks among the more illogical police deductions in recent memory. Elsewhere detecting and blocking each others tracking devices is pretty much the extent of their mental sparring. One of the series talking points has been its extremely negative portrayal of Albanians; ""Taken 2"" closed on a note suggesting the the blood feud would live on and it would have made sense here for it to continue here or for Mills to finally set foot in the hermit country. Alas those characters have been ditched in favor of Russian mafiosos who come across as pale imitations of the tattooed fiends in David Cronenbergs ""Eastern Promises."" What has made the ""Taken"" franchise such a guilty pleasure so far is its take-no-prisoners stance toward bad guys and its no-holds-barred brutality especially coming from Neeson an actor who radiates gravitas and nobility no matter what. Although less graphic in its representation of violence than its predecessors ""Taken 3"" retains a gutsy realism in scenes where Mills matter-of-factly cracks bones and splatters brains and the shoot-em-ups car wrecks and explosions are noisier and more bombastic than ever. Theyre also unimaginatively choreographed with zero forward momentum. Even as the scale of each production has increased the scope of the action has diminished Compared with scattering hand grenades all over Istanbul its mere childs play for Mills to blow up a classroom at Kims college. Without a doubt the first ""Taken"" movie gave Neeson then in his 50s a new lease on life as an action hero. Now 62 the actor still has an imposing presence but more often than not he looks pretty beat and impatient to get things over with. Kim has evolved from an exasperatingly clueless brat to a feisty rescuer over two films but there isnt any real progression in character development or in Graces performance here. Stuart a slimy wimp as played by Xander Berkeley in the first ""Taken"" served as a neat foil for our straight-talking straight-shooting hero. Replaced here by Scott he behaves like a badass dude who is supposed to be Mills equal in gun-toting prowess; its a wholly unconvincing transformation. As Russian mafioso Malankov Sam Spruell behaves like a cardboard James Bond villain showing some vicious individuality only in the action scenes. Tech credits are serviceable if creatively impoverished. The L.A. locations recall countless images of the city caught onscreen with lenser Eric Kress frequently using panoramic and helicopter shots of the citys skyline as visual crutches.

Lisa says February 1 2015 at 730 pm I loved this movie Yes he is fighting men half his age but in all Hollywood movies the chase scenes and fight scenes are far fetched and redundant. Hey this is LIam Neeson and I could watch him be this character for three more Takens I loved this movie even almost more than the first two. Reply Sal U. Lloyd says January 19 2015 at 910 pm I thought Megatron was the receiver of the Detroit Lions??? Reply Jonathan Stuart-Brown says January 19 2015 at 1043 am Liam Neeson is on course for another 300 million plus global movie from a sub 50 million budget. His action movies also do very well from DVD. Maybe time to revise the review of his movies and this franchaise. The first TAKEN was also panned by critics whose publications are now free giveways and on skeleton staffs compared to 2008. Moreover the Oscars will regain some credibility only when they start nominating British and Irish stars whose movies fly regularly rather than British and Irish stars whose movies even backed by huge Oscar nomination promotion budgets just do not get people buying tickets. Liam Neeson merits quite a few more nominations. People will still be watching his movies in many years time when so many Oscar winners have faded completely from memory. Many have in the last 5 10 and 20 years yet winners from say pre-1980 still hold up with regular TV airplay. Reply Elli Canterbury says January 11 2015 at 713 pm And we dont give a hoot about your review. Did you see where this movie you trashed took in more than 40 million this weekend? I hear Liam Neeson has a particular set of skills hed like to try on you. Reply Sal U. Lloyd says January 11 2015 at 825 pm Yeah thank you Michael Bay for your rebuttal. Reply John G says January 5 2015 at 454 pm I stopped reading this article as soon as this ass clown author decided to refer to Albanians as scuzzy balkan soccer fans. How did you get a job as a writer? Piece of shit hope you get taken then say that. Reply Sal U. Lloyd says January 5 2015 at 637 pm Youre right Mr. G. Ms Lee that is totally unacceptable. Reply Sal U. Lloyd says January 1 2015 at 739 pm Give it up Neeson youre becoming more embarrassing than Denzel or Samuel L. Move on Reply Alex says January 1 2015 at 238 pm Its an action flick go to theater buy Milk Duds watch hero kill bad guys. Enjoy. Reply Jonathan Stuart-Brown says January 1 2015 at 706 am Happy healthy prosperous New Year to everyone out there. Yes Liam Neeson at 62 has somehow according to Variety aged 12 actual years in 7. He was I believe 55 in 2008 and not 50. Not such a big jump for the great actor to continue and crucially no age at all in what is rightly described as a French movie. Old guys regularly get the young beautiful girl in French movies and with great panache aplomb style elan. Liam Nesson does have that ""je ne sais quoi"" and has greatly improved as an actor since his early TV days when he was always sound as an Irish character but not quite so brilliant as a French police Inspector. Nonetheless his patience persistence and dedication in working hard on these parts saw him progress every few years to another acting league. His rise from humble background and many real jobs in the real world - similar to Sean Connery - has given him the dignity and nobility. The question becomes why he suddenly took off as a major box office draw in 2008 and onwards. Why he entered the vacuum created by Mel Gibson as genuine great actor action man lead. Was it just that greenlit scripts which were due for Gibson got readdressed to Neeson ? Neeson showed great promise so very many times. In Excaliber he literally stood out because he towered over great actors yet it was Patrick Stewart who went on to 80s international stardom. Again he showed he had something special in cameos and support in Krull and The Bounty but it was Mel Gibson and Antony Hopkins who went on to much bigger box office stardom. As an Irish servant in Woman of Substance he smashed it in international TV. He had a pivitol moment after his support in The Mission. Although this relaunched Robert Di Niro (after a six film box office slump) to new heights in his second phase career and really moved Jeremy Irons up the box office list the one who deserved even more kudos as best newish comer was Neeson. He allegedly saw that he was now well able to do what he saw up close Oscar winners doing so he decided to risk being in LA not London or Belfast. In the 12 weeks or so that his savings lasted he landed the work to stay there. He was solid support in a Dirty Harry movie Deadpool but he was not seen as the new young Clint Eastwood nor the break out act Jim Carrey. But he could have been when he was in his 30s. he could have been the rival of Mel Gibson for parts in Lethal Weapon or Bruce Willis in Diehard. He could have been Batman instead of Michael Keaton. He could have done the roles Kurt Russell Eddie Murphy Sly Stallone Arnie and others were doing in the late 80s and 90s. As it was he ended up as a deaf and dumb mute in Suspect and the lead in a poorly scripted poorly directed under financed Darkman. Instead of taking off and he was fine in the now completely forgotten film noir as a private detective in Under Suspicion which just needed a marketing budget to be a hit and it is best to forget the dour movie Big Man aka Crossing The Line in which he was truly brilliant but the story depressing and again under-funded. He was ready for the stardom levels he has now achieved but the lack of right role the right story the undermarketing of movies meant that his fine efforts in Leap of Faith and his German Nazi turn in Shining Through meant he just trod water career wise. The casting in Schindlers ist surely showed people what he could do. Genius performance. But the next film Rob Roy was dreadful. This cost him 12 years. Had he been in Braveheart and Gibson in Rob Roy then Neeson would have been the action star of the 90s. Rob Roy was nasty in the worst sense. His performance was great and action scenes fine but the story was just ugly. He was outstanding as Michael Collins but alas it seems that very few wanted to see the movie based on modern Irish history. Then finally came Star Wars. The old Star Wars fans were impossible to please but the young new fans loved it and loved him. The delayed reaction until they could watch movies for teenagers meant his fan base was hidden a few years. Then they grew up saw him as their Harrison Ford and bought tickets to anything with Liam Neeson in. Happily he mostly now picks great stories and gets the scripts they used to send to Mel Gibson and Harrison Ford. 12 to 24 year old Fans love Liam Neeson and they buy cinema tickets. Get used to it. He is box office. Reply rjbailey says January 1 2015 at 609 am Reblogged this on Locating Frankensteins Brain. Reply Sal U. Lloyd says January 5 2015 at 635 pm Stuart Brown ROB ROY was nast???

Paris indeed. Another one ? Taken (2008) was nota low-budget B-movie  It had a normal budget for a French thriller as French actors are usually not paid 30 million euros  It changed when Europacorp realised the potential of the franchise at an international scale. But it remained a French franchise. The role of 20th century Fox in the US is only to ditribute/release the film.

Reply Mary Ann Farrell says December 31 2014 at 958 pm I thought the same thing. Its just basic math The first installment was the best as is the case in most movies but it has been fun to see Mr. Neeson as an action hero. If you like Liam Neeson just enjoy the film for what it is supposed to be-entertainment. Reply Jason says December 31 2014 at 921 pm What did you expect the godfather 2?
