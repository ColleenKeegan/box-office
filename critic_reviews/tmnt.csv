Turtle chortle Mimzy whimsy Updated  | Review  | Recommend E-mail | Print | Digg del.icio.us Newsvine Reddit Facebook Whats this? By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Family audiences will have more to choose from this week than theyve had in a while. But both movies aimed at children and their parents --TMNT and The Last Mimzy -- are likely to leave audiences with a distinct sense of deja vu. By calling itself TMNT (1/2 out of four) the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie is trying for a new image. But it takes more than an awkward title attempting to sound cool to overcome its mundane plot and silly dialogue. The story of the rebirth of the Ninja Turtles feels cobbled together as if it were assembled while the movie was being shot. There is little humor and the action seems more mechanical than exciting. It would seem the reason theyre trying to bring back this tired franchise has more to do with merchandising than filmmaking. When the movie begins the once-close Turtle brothers have grown apart. Leonardo (James Arnold Taylor) is off helping people in a Central American village Michelangelo (Mikey Kelley) entertains at birthday parties Donatello (Mitchell Whitfield) works as an IT troubleshooter and Raphael (Nolan North) keeps the city safe as a masked vigilante. When Leonardo comes home their rat sensei (Mako) urges them to train together again before they attempt any ninja exploits. But there is sibling rivalry to overcome nefarious enemies to conquer. Ho-hum. The film features two friendly humans -- April (voiced by Sarah Michelle Gellar) and Casey (Chris Evans) -- and adds new foes and potential allies including Winters (Patrick Stewart) and Karai (Ziyi Zhang). (Rated PG for animated action violence some scary cartoon images and mild language. Running time 1 hour 30 minutes. Opens today nationwide.) The Last Mimzy (  out of four) is disturbingly reminiscent of E.T. with about half the charm. Though the visual effects are sometimes stunning and the young actors particularly precocious Rhiannon Leigh Wryn are endearing the film feels as if its trying to force a sense of wonder and awe upon its youthful audience rather than simply letting an intriguing story unfold naturally. The film is based on a short story by Lewis Padgett about a sister and brother (Wryn and Chris ONeil) who stumble upon a mysterious box on the beach that changes their lives. Rainn Wilson so funny as the smarmy sycophant in The Office is inadvertently comic in this role thanks to his caricatured part as a New Age-y science teacher. His girlfriend played by Kathryn Hahn is even more of a stereotype. Both detract from the story of the childrens discovery which includes a stuffed bunny named Mimzy. The ambitious story tackles time travel pollution and environmental devastation as well as life on other planets. Its more sure-footed when dealing with those topics than when it attempts to create a sense of gritty reality as the kids and their parents (Tim Hutton and Joely Richardson) are rounded up by imposing squadrons from the Department of Homeland Security. These segments jeopardize the films dreamy potency. Many questions are left hanging throughout. When the seemingly levelheaded babysitter sees little Rhiannon do the humanly impossible why does she run off screaming rather than tell the childs parents? And why wouldnt the parents who are told ""it was just a magic trick"" by their young daughter ask to see said trick? Those are only two of the storys plot holes. Worse are the obvious attempts to borrow liberally from E.T. (even to the point of casting newcomer ONeil who bears a strong resemblance to E.T.s young Henry Thomas). There is some enchantment to be had in Mimzy but the magic centers on the children and their discovery. Unfortunately the movie grows muddled with too many tedious segments involving adults.

"TMNT Shell shocked | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesTMNT Shell shockedHi-tech tomfoolery clobbers lo-tech laughs in TMNT  and its enough to make a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle fan cry ""Cowabunga""By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. March 23 2007  (out of 4)Animated cartoon with the voices of Sarah Michelle Gellar Patrick Stewart Laurence Fishburne. Written and directed by Kevin Munroe. 90 minutes. At major theatres. G  Article Continued Below Hi-tech tomfoolery clobbers lo-tech laughs in TMNT and its enough to make a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle fan cry ""Cowabunga""Every bit as mechanical as the acronym title suggests this ill-advised attempt to restart the 1990s kid flick phenomenon is at best a soulless shell game.Rather than continue with the rubber turtle suits the comic martial arts moves and the endless wisecracks that made the four turtle bros and their original three movies so endearing to kids and parents the new franchise goes in for darker and more calculating fare.Everything is now computer-animated making more things possible but also leaving them bereft of human warmth. Its the chiselled kind of animation seen all too often of late where the humans of both sexes have Barbie-doll waists topped with massive chests. The turtles meanwhile look like oily gargoyles while Splinter their Zen master rat boss resembles Tony the Tiger with mange.Worst of all is the lack of genuine laughs. Writer-director Kevin Munroe a videogame specialist making his feature-film debut has apparently forgotten that the Ninja Turtle phenomenon started as rib-nudging parody. Creators Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird launched their shelled superheroes as a satirical comic book in 1984 looking to send up the pop-cult obsession with mutants and ninjas.Munroe seeks to stoke the nostalgia flames of the original comic book fans who are now in their 30s while at the same time reaching out to younger new fans. He fails on both counts because the movie is neither clever enough for adults nor compelling enough for kids.TMNT spreads dull wax on the shell of the story from the previous movie franchise which ended in 1993. The movie opens with turtles Donatello (Mitchell Whitfield) Leonardo (James Arnold Taylor) Michelangelo (Mikey Kelley) and Raphael (Nolan North) living apart and at odds because their family unity has been shattered.Having defeated arch-nemesis Shredder theyve lost their purpose in life. Leonardo has been dispatched by Splinter to Central America to regain his lost mojo and Donatello and Leonardo are stuck in dead-end jobs as computer techs and party clowns. Only the grumpy Raphael continues to stalk the streets.But at least we recognize the turtles. Their female companion April (Sarah Michelle Gellar) has been transformed from an intrepid TV reporter into a Lara Croft-style tomb raider and martial arts kicker a change not for the better. The gang is awkwardly reunited by the clanking machinery of the factory-issue story narrated by Laurence Fishburne which trots out the portal-from-another-dimension gambit seen in innumerable sci-fi and horror films. This gaping hole unleashes an immortal egghead named Maximilian J. Winters (Patrick Stewart) who seeks to take over the world or something like that. Hes brought with him a herd of indistinct monsters stone-faced creeps and ninja fighters who serve no purpose whatsoever apart from filling toy stores with violent crap aimed at impressionable minds.Remember when all the turtles really wanted were a few chuckles and a hot pizza? The yuks have long since been shelled out and the pizza barely makes an appearance probably because nobody would come up with the dough to pay for a product placement.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Starring John Malkovich and Jim Davidson. Directed by Brian Cook (Not rated. 89 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In the 1990s a nobody called Alan Conway passed himself off as a major somebody Stanley Kubrick the director of ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" and ""The Shining."" Conway went all over London claiming to be the esteemed filmmaker and a surprising number of people fell for it. They plied him with liquor gifts cash which he always seemed to be short of and in the case of young men -- a particular target -- sexual favors. Kubrick eventually learned of the impostor but little could be done to stop him because his victims fearful of looking foolish refused to file charges. ""Colour Me Kubrick"" is a somewhat fictionalized accounting of this amazing but true story. The filmmakers have wisely turned it into a comedy and a wickedly entertaining one at that exploiting in a humorous way the vanity that would inhibit people from questioning why someone of Kubricks stature would be hanging out with them. Even more wisely John Malkovich has been cast as the scammer who has con written all over him including in a marvelous touch of irony in his last name. The actor has a blast being ""Stanley Kubrick"" giving an outsized performance that alone is worth the price of admission. Malkovich plays the bogus Stanley as he insists his new best friends call him as a seducer. Dressed in outrageous getups -- bras worn over tops Madonna-style a little skirt pajama bottoms black lace gloves cravats and a ratty fur coat of questionable origin -- he preys on the vulnerable. In one scene he sashays up to an attractive male in a pub and starts complimenting him on the fashion designs hes sketching. Within minutes Conway has him believing hell be doing the costumes on a Kubrick epic. Conway sweet-talks himself into the life of TV and stage star Lee Pratt (played with great relish by TV and stage star Jim Davidson) who is soon footing enormous hotel bills for the great man based on a promise that he can get Pratt an act in Las Vegas. These encounters are a sort of in-joke. As Malkovich well knows the best directors are masters at seduction -- thats how they get everyone on a movie set to bend to their will. Malkovichs Conway is unwittingly acting the role of director. The film is on a similar theme as ""Six Degrees of Separation"" -- the mad desire to be associated with fame -- but doesnt take itself nearly as seriously which is all to the good. ""Colour Me Kubrick"" can claim one degree of separation from the real Stanley. Its directed by Brian Cook who was Kubricks assistant on several of his best-known movies. Cook throws in several allusions to Kubricks work. Two punks dressed as if they had stepped out of ""A Clockwork Orange"" knock on the door of what they believe to be Kubricks house because theyve picked Conway up there. In fact hes just hurried over from his far more modest digs. He runs down the street to the strains of background music from ""2001."" Watching ""Colour Me Kubrick"" its hard not to wonder what the real Kubrick who in another ironic touch died a few months after Conway would have thought of it. Hopefully he would have been as amused as everyone who sees this decidedly offbeat little film is certain to be. -- Advisory Sexual content. -- Ruthe Stein What Love Is Comedy. Starring Cuba Gooding Jr. Matthew Lillard Anne Heche and Gina Gershon. Directed by Mars Callahan. (R. 93 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""What Love Is"" stars Cuba Gooding Jr. Anne Heche and Sean Astin and yet it still has a weird community theater vibe. Mars Callahan may not be your favorite director but he certainly has a knack for getting decent actors to appear in his low-budget films. Unfortunately his latest movie is only a fraction as interesting as the directors ""Poolhall Junkies"" and much more of an acquired taste. If youre in your late 30s and still trolling for hookups in trendy bars these characters will probably speak to you. If not youre almost certain to find them annoying. Gooding is Tom a nice guy whose girlfriend leaves him on Valentines Day. While he waits for her to pick up the last of her suitcases his best friends and some women come over for an unplanned party and offer Tom and each other relationship advice. The supporting characters in ""What Love Is"" couldnt be bigger stereotypes. Theres responsible husband Ken (Callahan) alpha-male womanizer Sal (Matthew Lillard) new-age hippie George (Astin) and a flamboyant gay character who seems to be channeling Big Gay Al from ""South Park."" The women are an equally diverse group of cliches and you may ask the question How can all of these people possibly be friends without killing each other? The movie is filmed like a play with most of the action taking place in Toms living room or bathroom. Characters argue make up give advice rip on each other and make witty observations about dating and sex. Imagine if the pack from ""The Breakfast Club"" were still stuck in detention 20 years later. Callahan writes interesting dialogue but he films conversations like action director Michael Bay shoots car chases -- with quick edits and other distracting camera tricks. He also tries to cram about 120 minutes worth of words into a 90-minute movie to the point where some of the fast-talking characters sound like auctioneers. Heche seems out of place as a prudish friend and Lillard tries too hard to channel Vince Vaughn from ""Swingers"" but Gooding is solid in the leading-man role. He has some of the best lines and hes pretty much the only character you could stand to hang out with in real life. -- Advisory This film contains profanity graphic sexual dialogue and a random fantasy sequence with some really bad strippers. -- Peter Hartlaub TMNT Animated adventure. With the voices of Chris Evans Sarah Michelle Gellar Mako Patrick Stewart Ziyi Zhang and Laurence Fishburne. Written and directed by Kevin Munroe. (PG. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""TMNT"" begins with a sweeping computer-generated nightscape of a gritty New York as narrator Laurence Fishburne solemnly begins his introduction ""Four brothers ... four turtles ..."" This is a movie that has no idea how silly it is. That said ""TMNT"" the fourth feature-length film to chronicle the adventures of Leonardo Raphael Donatello and Michelangelo the sewer-dwelling crime-fighting Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (and the first made with computer-generated animation) is an enjoyable well-paced fantasy-action story. But its definitely made with fans in mind. It doesnt waste any time explaining how the turtle brothers came to be mutant ninjas (or for that matter to be named after Italian Renaissance masters) because it assumes its audience already knows. Instead ""TMNT"" takes up the action long after the brothers have defeated their archenemy Shredder. Leonardo the oldest brother and the designated leader has gone to Central America for ninja training and is dragging his feet about returning home. (He is after all a turtle.) Back in the sewers the other brothers have lost their way. Their teacher the anthropomorphic rat Splinter watches soap operas all day. Skateboarding goofball brother Michelangelo is renting himself out to childrens birthday parties as a clown called ""Cowabunga Carl."" Donatello has taken a job doing over-the-phone tech support. And secretly Raphael has taken to the streets as a vigilante called the Nightwatcher. When Leonardo returns the team is suddenly caught up in a conflict involving a 3000-year-old curse an immortal warrior and 13 monsters from a different dimension. Soon the turtles are fighting their old foes Karai (voiced by ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" star Ziyi Zhang) and the Foot Clan. But alliances among the various factions keep shifting and brotherly rivalry threatens to tear our heroes apart. For young children all this may be too complicated. It also gets quite violent and the monsters are pretty scary. But ""TMNT"" offers some real thrills. The computer animation gives the turtles relatively believable expressions movements musculature and (green) skin tones. Particularly impressive is a sequence involving a fight between Raphael and Leonardo on a rooftop in the rain. You may forget youre watching turtles. -- Advisory Cartoon violence scary monsters. Requires extreme suspension of disbelief. -- Will Crain Boy Culture Romance. Starring Patrick Bauchau Derek Magyar Darryl Stephens and Jonathon Trent. Directed by Q. Allan Brocka (Not rated 88 minutes. At the Castro.) ""Boy Culture"" is one of those boy-meets-boy boy-wants-boy but boy-works-hard-for-the-money movies that almost overcomes weak source material to become a decent film. Directed by Q. Allan Brocka from a novel of the same name by Matthew Rettenmund the film is narrated to within an inch of its life by an emotionally withdrawn hustler who calls himself ""X"" (Derek Magyar). His roommates include an oversexed 18-year-old named Joey (Jonathon Trent) and a sweet somewhat shy hottie named Andrew (Darryl Stephens). Joey loves X but X loves Andrew and Andrew loves X. Both X and Andrew are afraid to act on their feelings for reasons that turn out to be pretty similar. X has just a dozen regular clients. One dies and he has an opening (dont go there) so he agrees to take on a new client the older reclusive purringly cultivated Gregory (Patrick Bauchau). At their first meeting Gregory tells X he wont have sex with him until X desires him as well and of course X never really desires his employers. From the beginning of time writers and johns have convinced themselves of the existence of the hooker -- or in this case the hustler -- with the heart of gold. Trotting out that illusion again here director Brocka convinces us of its possibility largely through the engaging performances of his cast. What doesnt help him is that yakkety-yak narration. Despite the predictability of the plot we do get hooked on the will-they-or-wont-they between X and Andrew thanks to the poignant contribution of veteran Bauchau as a kind of father figure shrink and trick all rolled into one. Stephens a UC Berkeley graduate who spent four years with San Franciscos Sassymouth is the enormously appealing star of Logos addictive ""Noahs Ark."" His performance here is beautifully nuanced and three-dimensional as are those of Bauchau and Magyar. Working a bit too hard trying to catch up is Trent who nonetheless makes great eye candy. Despite the fact we know from the get-go how its going to come out ""Boy Culture"" deserves praise for not falling into every predictability trap of gay romance films.

In a portentous prologue narrator Laurence Fishburne recounts a fateful battle of Central American warlords 3000 years in the past an equally fateful alignment of cosmic forces and some hugger-mugger about generals made immortal and monsters turned to stone. Theres not a slice of pizza anywhere. Happily the prologue is just that and before long April ONeil the Turtles onetime TV news reporter friend - looking stick-thin and sounding like Sarah Michelle Gellar - runs into Leonardo (James Arnold Taylor) in Mexico where hes been busy meditating honing his ninja chops and thwacking thugs. She persuades Leonardo to return home where he encounters a listless trio Michelangelo (Mikey Kelley) Donatello (Mitchell Whitfield) and Raphael (Nolan North). Mikey and Donny have abandoned crime-busting to loll around their subway lair while Raphael unbeknownst to his colleagues and to their sage guru Splinter (Mako) skulks off nightly to interrupt muggers and robbers disguised as the Nightwatcher. The Turtles have become soft indifferent dysfunctional. But thanks to Maximilian Winters (Patrick Stewart) a kabillionaire mogul with a hidden past thats all about to change. Although the plot is unnecessarily complex with a troop of ninjas adding to the confusion TMNT moves along at a good pace. The Turtles work out their issues and proceed to leap rooftops crack heads and crack wise. Darker and a little scarier than the live-action films and the Turtles animated series TMNT is not so dark or scary as to keep most kids away. Written and directed by animator Kevin Munroe TMNT has a cool noirish sheen. Theres an attention to detail in the visuals and sound design that pushes it up several notches above most kiddie fare. Its not art dude but it will do. TMNT 1/2 (out of four stars) Directed by Peter Laird. With the voices of James Arnold Taylor Mikey Kelley Sarah Michelle Gellar Patrick Stewart and Nolan North. Distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. Running time 1 hour 26 mins.

BY Elizabeth Weitzman DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER Sunday March 25 2007 922 PM View the gallery ""TMNT"" Animated entry in the family-friendly ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" franchise about four junk food-loving crime-fighting turtles. With the voices of Sarah Michelle Gellar Zhang Ziyi. Director Kevin Munroe (130). PG Cartoon violence scary images mild language. At area theaters. Say it with me now Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. No it doesnt pack the same comic punch it did back in 1984. But theres still something agreeably silly about the combination of four words that would never in a sensible world have landed next to each other. So why exactly did writer-director Kevin Munroe whittle the title of the latest chapter of the turtles saga down to ""TMNT""? Was he worried that a 23-year-old franchise might not be cool enough to get kids into theaters anymore? That slight sense of desperation trickles through this adventure like drips in a New York City sewer which just happens to be where our heroes live. Well three anyway. The oldest Leonardo (voiced by James Arnold Taylor) went to train in Central America leaving his abandoned brothers Raphael (Nolan North) Donatello (Mitchell Whitfield) and Michelangelo (Mikey Kelley) in various states of shell shock. Donny and Mikey have miserable day jobs while Raph has become a masked vigilante. Meanwhile their old friends April (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and Casey (Chris Evans) have discovered that ancient monsters are loose in the city causing serious damage. April convinces Leo to return home and while hes surprised to see how much things have changed theres little time to catch up. Almost immediately the turtles find themselves fighting the beasts another ninja (Zhang Ziyi) and each other. Munroes script is amusing enough to keep younger kids entertained and big siblings may be impressed by a long swooping skateboarding scene and the anime-inspired fights. But these characters dont feel like the turtles of old; theres not enough excitement to reinvent the franchise and just barely enough to revive it. At its best ""TMNT"" does recall the slangy fun of the series glory days. But there are too many moments when it feels as stale as one of Mikeys half-eaten pizzas.

"Ninja Turtles get seriously animated - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEW Ninja Turtles get seriously animatedMarch 23 2007|Michael Ordona | Special to The Times In the age of ""Batman Begins"" and ""Superman Returns"" the hatchers of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise must have seen a promising opportunity to re-imagine their heroes for a new generation. Toward that end ""TMNT"" bids farewell to the jokey cheesy guys-in-rubber-suits world of the 90s movies in favor of a more character-oriented approach a grittier look and superb computer animation -- with decidedly mixed results.This installment finds the reptilian crime fighters idling as they wait for anointed leader Michelangelo to complete the training for which sensei Splinter has sent him away. Rebellious Raphael however is secretly moonlighting as an armored vigilante and building resentment toward his absent brother. The team reunites in time to contend with an immortal warlord and his stone generals who are collecting monsters to open a Ghostbuster-ish cosmic portal.""TMNT"" features an impressive collection of voice talent led by Patrick Stewart as a mysterious industrialist Ziyi Zhang as the leader of the rival ninjas and the late Mako as Splinter the turtles rat ""father."" By the way Splinter is now cuddly. The detail in the movement and color of his fur makes him the cutest human-sized sewer rat youll ever see.""Shrek"" and ""The Incredibles"" may have raised the animation bar but the texture in the costumes and the turtles skin even in the way distinct raindrops splash and dissipate on characters faces stands up to comparison. The gloomy city backgrounds are beautifully rendered and the villain and monster design is excellent. The stone generals look like something right out of comic god Jack Kirbys feverish dreams. For The Record Los Angeles Times Saturday March 24 2007 Home Edition Main News Part A Page 2 National Desk 0 inches; 26 words Type of Material Correction TMNT The review of ""TMNT"" in Fridays Calendar section referred to the ""anointed leader"" of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as Michelangelo. Leonardo is the leader.Alas these turtles are not so happy together. The family-schism subplot involving Leonardo (James Arnold Taylor) and Raphael (Nolan North) seems wedged in for gravitas but all it does is weigh the movie down. It also reminds us of the all-too-obvious X-Men parallels Leonardo as the ho-hum Cyclops analogue and Raphael as a poor mans Wolverine without the humor.Thats really what ""TMNT"" lacks most -- humor. Despite the doll-like cartoonishness of the human figures (O Pixar what hast thou wrought?) the filmmakers seem to expect us to take this animated romp seriously. Too seriously. More of good-naturedly dimwitted skateboarding brother Michelangelo (Mikey Kelley) with his ""cowabungas"" and surfer-dude idiocy would have been welcome.Fans of the comic book may disagree but a franchise that began as a parody of superheroes doesnt seem suited to the serious approach.""TMNT.""

"TMNT has style lacks substance - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Upgraded turtles have style lack substance In ""TMNT"" the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles reunite to battle immortal stone warriors who are trying to destroy the world. (WARNER BROS. PICTURES) By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  March 23 2007 Kids too young to remember the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle phenomenon when it was upon us in the early 1990s probably wont appreciate the fully computer-generated upgrade. But ""TMNT"" is made for them -- and nostalgic stoners. (The filmmakers have struck while the iron is cold.)The movie is a serviceable way to pass the time Kids will cheer the bright colors and funny new words (""Kowabunga""). And they will probably have missed the cartoon series and the three rubbery live-action movies dedicated to it. So it will come as news.Laurence Fishburnes holy baritone fills them in during the movies opening sequences. Turtles named after Renaissance painters were radioactively turned super-reptilian in the sewers of New York and started fighting crime. Having done away with their archenemy Shredder (see live-action film number two) theyve broken up and are pursuing new interests. Donatello (voiced by Mitchell Whitfield ) does tech support. Michelangelo (Mikey Kelly ) works the kiddie-party circuit. Leonardo (James Arnold Taylor ) the groups leader lives in South America. And Raphael (Nolan North ) cruises the streets in armor as a vigilante. The group apparently is finished.But a technocrat (Patrick Stewart ) is threatening to take over the world with a bunch of immortal warriors made of stone. According to an ancient myth for complete dominion he needs to catch one more Pokemon -- I mean warrior. Can the archeologist April (Sarah Michelle Gellar ) her crime-fighting boyfriend Casey (Chris Evans ) and the wise rat mentor Splinter (Mako ) help the turtles get their act together in time? And exactly whose side is Shredders niece (Ziyi Zhang ) on?The animators and designers of ""TMNT"" create a big city with cool verisimilitude. The buildings shimmer as they scrape the sky and you can practically smell the sewers fetid air. The turtles faces have a readable range of expression (although Michelangelo just looks stoned the whole picture). This is an impressive achievement for characters with virtually no lips and whose eyes almost reach the sides of their heads.The men doing the turtles voices bring the heroes to life but the only truly memorable one is the brooding chronically bitter Raphael whom I imagine Michael Chiklis playing in a live-action version (thats not a recommendation). He sounds like he actually might have been toxically born and bre d in the gutters of New York City -- Brooklyn to be exact. The writers have taken care to give him emotional depth and a dark worldview that other loner-misfit superheroes like Batman and Wolverine  might appreciate. Its scary to ponder the better movie ""TMNT"" might have been if that kind of inspiration had been equally spread.But all this care serves an underwhelming end The movie still looks like a video game and that synthetic tone characterizes all the action. The camera frequently rotates around a lot of the fights creating the impression that the writer and director Kevin Munroe did most of his work using a control pad. (Its worth mentioning that the humans with their stiff movements and rigid reactions are like gaming avatars with rifle butts for chins.)That attention to physical detail is undercut by a story that the filmmakers appear to have presumed kids wouldnt really care about. Its true theyll want action. But by any means necessary?The major battle sequence comes out of nowhere and I dont mean it comes too soon (it doesnt) but it just crashes on top of the movie signaling that its almost time to go home. All the energy of this plot is geared toward some kind of showdown but that it feels anticlimactic underscores how flat this movie is. The battle is purely the result of commercial will -- these things usually are -- but its rare that you can feel a movies obligation to give the kids what their parents paid for.""TMNT"" is a junk-food pastry. The plot is the wrapper. The action is the oily sponge cake. And the message -- family family family -- is the processed cream filling. The production logo at the beginning of this movie reads Warner Bros. but I wouldnt have batted an eyelash if it had said Hostess.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Cowabunga dudes Fifteen years after their first cinematic foray the pizza-loving sewer-dwelling crime-fighting Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are back. However in stark contrast to the 1990 live-action original (as well as sequels in 91 and 93) which relied on animatronics and short guys in foam suits this CGI-animated update is fluid kinetic and action-packed. Its dark tone is also closer to Peter Laird and Kevin Eastmans 1984 comic-book than to the cute computer-game and TV cartoon spin-offs which followed.In modern New York Leonardo Michelangelo Donatello and Raphael together with their sewer-rat sensei Splinter are pitted against multi-billionaire Maximillian J Winters four re-born stone generals sundry 3000-year-old monsters and the turtles old ninja rivals the Foot Clan. The turtles superfluous human side-kicks serve to complicate an already confusing plot. Even so Kevin Munroe directs with affection and skill. Its not exactly Renaissance art but it is an honourable attempt to revive the turtle-tastic franchise.

"TMNT Testudinal Fortitude washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On TMNT Testudinal Fortitude Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday March 23 2007 If you have to ask what ""TMNT"" means this movie probably isnt for you -- youre so far behind the curve youll never catch up. Its the fourth in a series chronicling the adventures of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles who live under the streets of New York and come out to fight for truth justice and pizza by night but its the first to arrive in complete computer-generated imagery. Thats not bad thats good. For me at least seeing actual humans in the roles of mutated terrapins with samurai swords and burglar masks -- so you wouldnt recognize them I suppose -- was too much of a stretch. Here under the direction of Kevin Munroe who oversaw a fleet of geeks hunched over terminals (""Faster number 23 faster"") the movies world the characters the outsize plot all of it at least makes some kind of coherent sense but maybe thats just the grown-up in me searching desperately for those props called ""rules."" Its a far grittier grungier kind of New York than in the previous films and the detail has been worked out to a thoroughly impressive degree. In fact as a piece of film design the movie is first-rate; on sheer aesthetics alone it rivals ""Triumph of the Will"" for astonishments. As a movie rather than a design exercise its also not without its pleasures. The vocal performances (Patrick Stewart for one; Sarah Michelle Gellar for another and of course the adorable Ziyi Zhang for still another) are vivid. The action sequences are well done particularly a dust-up between Raphael the ""Maverick"" and Leo the deposed and now returned ""leader."" They fight with Japanese weapons because although theyre turtles theyre still ninja. Hmm but how come the old concrete-head in me keeps thinking how come Raph carries sai or sword-breakers those three-pronged tools the bailiffs used to carry to disarm unruly samurai? The only other people carrying samurai swords were his brothers so why is he prepared to fight only them and no one else? Again the ancient concreteness of my mind is getting me in trouble here. Anyway only on one issue does ""TMNT"" pretty much flop. That is its plot. Or rather its plots all 16 of them. It gets off with a big splat a chunk of exposition so dense not even a 13-year-old could stay with it. It goes something like this 3000 years ago a mighty warrior set out to conquer the world at the same time benefiting from a unique alignment of the stars that (a) granted him immortality (b) turned all his generals to stone and (c) unleashed 13 monsters on the world. Now 3000 years later those stars are about to realign again and when they do if he can catch all 13 bad hairy things and send them back up the stairway to heaven his generals will cease to be stone and he will cease to be immortal. So he hires ninja to capture the monsters who have moved to New York where they fit in with the population. So theres him; theres that ninja team (headed by Ziyi Zhangs Kaira a part the actress must have recorded in about 15 minutes one morning); then it turns out the stone generals dont want to go up in the sky so they form another team; meanwhile our heroes themselves riven by internal stress (Raph is ticked at Leo who is meanwhile having doubts) are also trying to catch the monsters but also another vigilante named ""Nightwatcher"" who is actually . . . well its like trying to count the stars; fella could go nuts. The upshot is that the film is technically superb and quite enjoyable as long as you dont bang your head against the plot which will cause hot flashes premature aging and fallen arches. TMNT (90 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for visual intensity.

Animation quality is leagues beyond the hand-drawn style that launched the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to popularity and the storyline is no shallower than ""300"" (even if ripped turtle shells have nothing on Spartan abs) but pic lacks the personality that made these animated action figures so appealing 20 years ago. Conceived for fans but dumbed down for tots ""TMNT"" takes one of the most curious comicbook phenoms of the 80s and translates it to yet another platform a PG-rated all-CG toon. Animation quality is leagues beyond the hand-drawn style that launched the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to popularity and the storyline is no shallower than ""300"" (even if ripped turtle shells have nothing on Spartan abs) but pic lacks the personality that made these animated action figures so appealing 20 years ago. Kids will devour this like anchovy-free pizza while nostalgia-driven kidult attendance should spell sequels for this ""cash cowabunga."" Born as an irreverent one-off underground comic Kevin Eastman and Peter Lairds 1984 ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" creation was quickly co-opted for toys Saturday morning cartoons live-action features and videogames galore. Each incarnation offered a slightly different riff on the basic premise -- four New York sewer-dwelling turtle-men christened after Renaissance painters who cracked jokes and fought crime under the guidance of a rat named Splinter -- while taking the property farther away from its roots as a spoof of early 80s comicbook obsessions with mutant and ninja subjects. ""TMNT"" is nothing if not a blatant attempt to sell more toys and tie-ins with precious little attention paid to pleasing the fans for whom the pic was allegedly greenlit. And yet rather than repeating the gangs origin story for the uninitiated the film picks up where the other movies left off. Time has passed and Shredder the gangs longtime nemesis is still out of commission and his minions (including one voiced by Ziyi Zhang) have become ninjas for hire. Narrator Laurence Fishburne warns that ""a greater evil is poised to destroy"" humankind but in-fighting among the turtles seems a greater threat than the 13 monsters mentioned in the movies underwhelming intro (collect them all kids). ""TMNT"" would have done well to borrow a page from the James Bond/Indiana Jones playbook It desperately needs an adrenaline-fueled pre-credits sequence to jumpstart the action. Instead pic offers a long 3000-year-old prologue followed by a bizarre South American jungle encounter in which April ONeil (voiced by Sarah Michelle Gellar) reunites with Leonardo (James Arnold Taylor) leader of the gang. Only April isnt exactly herself having ditched TV news reporting in favor of archaeological field work. Meanwhile the turtles -- Leonardo Michelangelo (Mikey Kelley) Donatello (Mitchell Whitfield) and Raphael (Nolan North) -- have gone soft in their old age with all but Raphael abandoning their vigilante ways. Before ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" before ""Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go"" the franchise provided kids an adult-confounding tongue-twister to embrace. But the ""TMNT"" acronym spoils the fun -- and besides the ""T"" no longer applies These teenage mutants are now twentysomething slackers. Their surfer-talk has gone from trend-setting to retro and writer-director Kevin Munroe forgot to write them any good dialogue. Ditching the cheeky self-aware wink that helped to excuse the concepts inherent corniness the movie attempts to look polished and ""cool"" but the been-there animation cant compete with the then-cutting-edge puppetry of the 1990 live-action movie. Whereas most toons take years to produce Hong Kong-animated ""TMNT"" was rushed through the pipeline in just 28 months. The turtles themselves look great with perceptible design differences among them beyond their face-mask colors and weapon selections and the nocturnal Gotham environments impress. But the human characters -- namely April sidekick Casey Jones (Chris Evans) and villain Maximillian Winters (Patrick Stewart) -- disappoint their mouths matching their dialogue with all the accuracy of a sock puppet. Considering the inevitable sequels (bolstered by none-too-subtle references to ""further business"" involving ""familiar faces from your past"") its a shame that ""TMNT"" manages only two virtuoso scenes. In the first Michelangelo skateboards from street level through the sewers to the turtles secret lair in a single take the camera looping and swirling along for the ride as no live-action shot possibly could. Later Leonardo and Raphael have a rooftop face-off in the rain revealing the full potential of how a ""TMNT"" fight might look (neither the original toon nor the movies clunky full-body costumes could support this level of action). But the rest feels little more than obligatory with Munroes script denying fans the satisfaction of a decent story or amusing interactions. Rather than waiting for a screenplay that warranted their bigscreen return ""TMNT"" feels like an attempt to exploit the phenomenon further. TMNTU.S.-Hong Kong ProductionA Warner Bros.
