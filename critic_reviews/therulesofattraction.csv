Comments The Rules of Attraction Spoiled and pretty New England college kids live it up at a series of theme parties drinking screwing and dropping ecstasy until a brief moment of moral illumination arrives in the last scene to get us all off the hook. Writer-director Roger Avary (Killing Zoe) adapted an old novel by Bret Easton Ellis the poet laureate of tortured rich kids and his screenplay for this 2002 release is heavy with gimmicks in one sequence a split screen follows two of the characters as they progress toward a fateful meeting with each other; in another a character whos arrived late in the film buzzes through an encyclopedic description of his escapades in Europe with fast-motion flashbacks and voice-over; and throughout the film key incidents are followed by reverse-motion that tracks the characters back to earlier moments in the story. Actually I quite enjoyed the movie--but how do I get rid of this awful discharge? With James Van Der Beek Shannyn Sossamon Ian Somerhalder and Faye Dunaway. 104 min. By J.R.

The Rules of Attraction Roger Avarys floridly startling adaptation of Ellis 1987 novel has arrived with a smaller profile - and thats a shame since it brings Ellis glibly corrosive vision of elite college thrill seekers to life in a way that cant be dismissed. Avary plots out every scene with voyeuristic ingenuity using split screen reverse motion and at one point a rapid-fire video diary of a bacchanalian trip through Europe to create a world in which time is racing forward yet standing still the eternal present tense of days and nights lived in the zombie pleasure zone. Avary like Ellis has a taste for decadence that cant be faked. Fleshing out the authors groovy porno vision of the Real World he has caught the suicide swagger of college kids who connect by turning themselves into emotional whores who act as if connection isnt possible. ""The Rules of Attraction"" is the kind of Gen-X-treme straight-meets-gay boy-eats-girl bash that the artless show-off Gregg Araki (""The Doom Generation"") has been trying to bring off for years; its a party-hearty teen flick that scalds like acid. The cast is a pitch-perfect assemblage of pretty young things but James Van Der Beek as a slit-eyed dorm stud proves that he can be an actor of cruel force.

Nevius Mick LaSalle Carla Meyer Published 400 am Friday October 11 2002 BLOODY SUNDAY Historical drama. Directed and written by Paul Greengrass. (Rated R. 110 minutes. At the Embarcadero Act in Berkeley Century in Pleasant Hill Century 16 in Mountain View CineArts in Sausalito and Camera 3 in San Jose.) ""Bloody Sunday"" a re-creation of one day in recent Irish history is so astonishingly good that one feels a collision of simultaneous emotions elation at the superb craftsmanship and suspense that director Paul Greengrass accomplishes and heartbreak at the events he portrays and their relevance today. On Jan. 30 1972 British soldiers opened fire on unarmed civilians participating in a civil rights march through Derry Northern Ireland. Twenty- seven people were shot 13 killed. None of the soldiers was disciplined and the event known as Bloody Sunday became a turning point in the Irish troubles boosting the ranks of the Irish Republican Army and initiating a bloody civil war. Greengrass tells the story in the frame of one day and shoots it in documentary style -- capturing a sense of urgency and impending chaos showing us police demonstrators religious leaders and British soldiers through the same intimate lens. Nothing looks rehearsed and each of the dozens of actors seems to respond to the action while it unfolds. Theres not a false note no trace of ""acting"" -- just a searing realism thats very very rare onscreen. In a hospital sequence post-massacre Greengrass creates an amazing density of detail Families wait for news of the injured untended bodies line the corridors nurses scramble for help and reporters looking dazed and helpless hold notepads. ""Bloody Sunday"" is a great achievement tense and passionate a film that one feels not just emotionally but also physically. With the United States poised for military aggression against Iraq its impossible not to draw parallels between Northern Ireland and the Middle East or to wish that films like ""Bloody Sunday"" however great werent so necessary. . This film contains strong language and violence. -- Edward Guthmann TUCK EVERLASTING Romance. Starring Ben Kingsley William Hurt Sissy Spacek and Alexis Bledel. Directed by Jay Russell. (PG 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . Perhaps the best teen date movie ever set in the year 1914 ""Tuck"" represents a brave leap against the tide. No sex no car crashes and minimal violence. It just might be a hit. Lets concede that you have to buy into the premise and that the languid pace may put off some viewers. You can see teenage guys getting dragged to the show by their dates. But theyd better be careful or the emotional ending may have them gulping back a lump in their throats. Not that theyll admit it of course. The story based on the popular book by Natalie Babbitt hinges on a will- she-or-wont-she decision but not in the usual sense. Winnie a self-assured teen who is battling the restraints imposed by over-protective parents is whisked away to the woods by a mysterious but sensitive stranger Jesse Tuck (Jonathan Jackson). That he is also a total hunk wont hurt the box office. The two romp discreetly in the fields and streams and fall in love. Thats when Jesse reveals the family secret. By drinking from a hidden spring he and his family have become immortal. Jesse asks Winnie to take a sip -- the ultimate teen drinking dilemma -- so they can live together forever 17. As Winnie ""Gilmore Girl"" Alexis Bledel shines. Freed from the manic pingpong repartee of the popular WB TV show Bledel shows depth and range. A weaker actress could have turned this into cotton candy. Everyone else falls neatly into place. William Hurt as Angus Tuck cant stand to just play the wise and knowing patriarch; he has to throw in a distracting Scottish accent. Still he gets the payoff lines ""Dont be afraid of death. Be afraid of the unlived life"" and carries them off. Sissy Spacek makes another welcome appearance after a career hiatus. Meanwhile Ben Kingsley effortlessly commands the camera as the evil Man in the Yellow Suit. ""You speak blasphemy sir"" a character says to Kingsley. ""Fluently"" he replies beaming. If nothing else the lush emerald setting will keep you watching. Winnie and Jesse find love amid a backdrop of waterfalls forest glens and a spotted fawn. All that is missing is Vin Diesel on a dirt bike. Hell be back soon enough of course but this is a pleasant change of pace until then. -- C.W. Nevius  THE TRANSPORTER  Action. Starring Jason Statham Shu Qi and Francois Berleand. Directed by Corey Yuen. (PG-13. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . If Jason Stathams starring role in ""The Transporter"" means well be seeing him headlining more movies in the future then something good will have come of this routine and rather silly action movie. Statham who was in Guy Ritchies ""Snatch"" and ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" is a screen natural with the cockney insolence self-deprecating humor and basic geniality of a young Roger Daltrey. Unfortunately he doesnt get to show much personality in ""The Transporter"" in which he plays a machinelike fellow who values precision above all. Even the humanizing touch of a romance doesnt help -- Stathams chemistry with leading lady Shu Qi is nonexistent. Written by Luc Besson (""The Fifth Element"") and Robert Mark Kamen (""Gladiator"") the picture stars Statham as Frank a former Special Forces operator who now works as a freelance ""transporter"" in France. In other words he drives. Sometimes he moves merchandise; sometimes he drives a getaway car. Hes a scientific driver. He has everything worked out mathematically which is why in the first scene he is upset to find himself picking up four bank robbers at a crime scene instead of three. At his insistence one of the robbers has to be killed and tossed out of the car before hell drive away. Frank is big on rules one of which is never to look inside any package he might be transporting. But one fine afternoon he peeks and finds a woman (Shu Qi) and from there his life begins to unravel. It does worse than unravel. Soon guys are bombing his house with missiles and he has no idea why. That the movie becomes silly isnt necessarily a problem but it also becomes tiresome degenerating into a series of martial arts interludes -- everyone unaccountably leaves his guns at home. That suddenly everyone in the movie becomes a martial artist makes no sense until one discovers that the director is Corey Yuen who has served as martial arts choreographer on a number of high-profile Hollywood films (""Lethal Weapon 4"" ""Romeo Must Die""). Even then it doesnt make sense; its just explainable. This film contains violence strong language and sexual situations. -- Mick LaSalle FAMILY FUNDAMENTALS Documentary. Directed and written by Arthur Dong. (Not rated. 75 minutes. At the Opera Plaza and Shattuck in Berkeley). . Arthur Dongs documentary ""Family Fundamentals"" is an earnest heartrending look at the divide between religious fundamentalists and their gay relatives. Its also heavy-handed and devotes too much time to bigoted views. The trouble with right-wing zealots is that theyre so darned organized. In ""Fundamentals"" they can elucidate their principles on command. Their gay offspring by contrast sputter or react emotionally when faced with examples of relatives intolerance -- usually supplied by the filmmaker. Dong devotes ample time to Kathleen Bremner head of a posse of parents who want their gay kids to go straight. She has to work double time because her daughter and beloved grandson are gay. Bremners lifestyle choice is disturbing but so are Dongs manipulative tactics. He alerts Bremners relatives to her anti-gay remarks on camera in hopes of provoking a response. Theyre hurt and angry and documentary filmmaking is sullied. ""Fundamentals"" has laudable qualities the best of which is its depiction of the complexity of faith and family. Brett gay son of Mormons knows his parents love for him is as entrenched as their conviction that hes going to hell. Gay people often talk of ""chosen families"" and the film depicts one of those as well. Brian Bennett a gay man and staunch Republican was a close aide to former congressman and strident homophobe Bob Dornan. Not surprisingly Bennett and the surrogate dad he called ""Poppy"" parted ways after the young man came out. Like his mentor Bennett is smart funny and likable -- until you consider his years of collusion with Dornans anti-gay rhetoric. Dong erred in presenting Bennett in the same light as the others. They were born into bigotry; Bennett sought it out. -- Carla Meyer KNOCKAROUND GUYS Drama. Starring Barry Pepper Vin Diesel John Malkovich. Directed and written by Brian Koppelman and David Levien. (R. 93 minutes. At Bay Area theaters). . The lackluster mob picture ""Knockaround Guys"" sat on the studio shelf for two years. Its finally seeing the light of day apparently because Vin Diesel has become a made man in Hollywood. The ""XXX"" star plays the muscle in a group of Gen-X Mafia sons trying to show their worth to their fathers. ""Knockaround"" proves that Diesel needs direction even if that direction is ""Drive your bike off the cliff."" He looks uncomfortable when shot in repose; hes simply inert rather than emotive unless hes pulling on a cigarette which allows for a squint. Diesel seems at ease only when cracking heads. The scenes of violence unfortunately are the most effective in the film. Director-writers Brian Koppelman and David Levien (""Rounders"") dont spare the bullets but theyre otherwise adrift. The mob scions leave Brooklyn for Montana to find a lost bag of cash. But the picture doesnt know whether to be a fish-out-of-water comedy or male- bonding drama. Theres too little use of the comic talent on board -- including the always reliable Seth Green (""Austin Powers"") as the boys dimwitted pilot -- and too many heartfelt talks about honor among two-bit junior thieves. The real problem lies with the premise. Were supposed to feel sorry for these spoiled Mafia kids because their dads dont respect them and they cant make it in the straight world. Its like a whole film devoted to A.J. Soprano and his friends only these characters arent half as likable as A.J. Except Barry Pepper (HBOs ""61"") who has the lead role as the son of the most prominent mobster (Dennis Hopper). Peppers dark pompadour pouty mouth and leather jacket suggest Elvis in his 68 comeback special and his intense expression bespeaks a valiant effort to elevate this claptrap. Theres one truly disturbing element to ""Knockaround Guys"" John Malkovich has usurped the traditional Christopher Walken role as Peppers oily psycho uncle. Its a comedown for the respected actor sure but thats not the worrisome part. With Malkovich now available for the fey ham-fisted criminal roles what will become of Walken? . This film contains violence raw language. -- Carla Meyer THE RULES OF ATTRACTION Drama-comedy. Starring James Van Der Beek Shannyn Sossamon Jessica Biel. Directed by Roger Avary. Written by Avary from Bret Easton Ellis book. (R. 104 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . If the film version of ""The Rules of Attraction"" were set in 1987 when the Bret Easton Ellis novel came out its characters would be mere degenerates. But director-screenwriter Roger Avary has moved the books cokehead date- raping college nihilists to the present day where they come off as pure sociopaths. Occasionally entertaining sociopaths but sociopaths nonetheless. Nearly every bodily fluid makes an appearance in ""Rules"" a mean-spirited paean to hedonism set at an East Coast college where students attend class only occasionally and then only to perform oral sex on instructors. Why this film was made now is a puzzler but heres a theory It lets a couple of WB stars be naughty. ""Dawsons Creeks"" James Van Der Beek finally puts that hulking brow to use playing a creepy drug dealer who preys on drunk women. But he doesnt prey on them to the extent the other goons do which in this sordid world qualifies him as our hero. Van Der Beek wears a fierce expression throughout perhaps to distance himself from that cerebral softie Dawson. To his credit he makes his character less a cipher than those around him. Jessica Biel (""7th Heaven"") plays a backstabbing tramp whose coke habit causes nosebleeds. But shes just a supporting character; the truly demeaning stuff has been saved for the leading lady Shannyn Sossamon (""A Knights Tale"") whose character is raped (and videotaped) in the movies opening moments. At least the film version of ""American Psycho"" acknowledged Ellis disdain for women by making them just as farcical as murderer Patrick Bateman. ""Rules"" tries to elicit sympathy for its female characters while it defiles them. Van Der Beeks character Sean Bateman might be Patricks brother. He once mentions a ""Patrick"" but obliquely. Its a nod to Ellis devotees if there still are such people. Filmmaker Avary once deftly mixed humor and ugliness in co-writing ""Pulp Fiction"" with Quentin Tarantino. Hes lost his touch. ""Rules"" has only a few truly funny moments and they come from bit players. Clifton Collins Jr. is an eye-popping riot as a drug dealer and Russell Sams is sublime as a flamboyant preppy who taunts his sozzled mother (a slurringly perfect Swoosie Kurtz) with constant references to his gayness. ""Rules"" might have been more fun were it a little gayer. Ian Somerhalder saucy and strikingly handsome plays a sexually ambiguous dandy who once dated Sossamons character and now pines for Van Der Beeks. But their triangle is underdeveloped. What a cop-out. Drugs and casual sex are very very old hat for teen movies. Having Dawson get it on with a guy would have been genuinely provocative. This film contains nudity raw language sexual situations and a rape scene. -- Carla Meyer POKEMON 4EVER RATING (Empty Chair) Childrens movie. Directed by Jim Malone. (G. 77 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . Tepid claptrap. The filmmakers must have known that the Pokemon craze had fizzled when they were making this but even if Pokemon cards were still being traded frantically in elementary school this would be a snooze. The kindest thing that can be said is that this film successfully bends the time/space continuum. It manages to make 80 minutes seem longer for a 6-year- old than a formal dinner at Grandmas. Granted it isnt easy. The Pokemon target audience presents a pretty narrow window. They must be young enough to buy into the concept of something like Celebi who may look like a large clove of garlic with blue eyes but actually has incredible powers. And they must be old enough to make sense of the complicated Pokemon culture. Good luck with that. But what we get here is likely to please neither. A boy Ash leads a happy life using his trained Pokemon Pikachu to battle other Pokemon. In a scene that is presented as wholesome fun Pikachu sends out a bolt of electricity that knocks his opponent and the boy who owns him unconscious. Lets see pitting trained animals against each other. Isnt that illegal in most states? Things swing wildly back and forth from there. At one point two characters are sent out to battle one of whom has a campfire blazing at the end of his tail and the other a large bay leaf on his head as a weapon. At best this is a film for the under-7 crowd. But it would be better to wait for the video. And a very rainy day. -- C.W.

"Rules of Attraction The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; rules-of-attraction-the ) Rules of Attraction The (United States 2002) A movie review by James Berardinelli Once you get past all of the wild camera tricks and visual gimmickry you arrive at the core of The Rules of Attraction and find out that its really about something other than replicating the party life at a New England college. Working from his own screenplay which has its roots in the Bret Easton Ellis novel writer/director Roger Avary (best known for co-penning Pulp Fiction and for helming Killing Zoe) spins a yarn about the pain of unrequited love that is at times darkly funny and at other times depressingly tragic. Its safe to say there arent any movies out there quite like this one. It is possible to consider The Rules of Attraction to be an anti-romantic comedy. The Hollywood convention is that whenever a boy meets a girl love will follow as quickly as the clichA(c)s allow. In real life sex and romance are less perfect and in not giving in to the ""love conquers all"" mentality Avarys film uncovers an important truth about male/female relationships a that attraction isnt always mutual and even when it is happily-ever-after is frequently not the result. Each of the three protagonists in this movie is in love (or lust or whatever) but none of them finds their feelings reciprocated to the same degree. The movies approach might make viewers think of Memento as straightforward. The Rules of Attraction begins at the end then after moving forward a little backs up (literally going backwards) then re-starts following the actions of a different character. After another iteration we have the opening credits where time is going in accelerated reverse until were months in the past and we get to see how the characters arrived at the point where we first came in on them. Got it? After you get the hang of it its not too confusing a at least most of the time. (In keeping with his penchant for moving in reverse Avary presents the end credits in that fashion starting with all the disclaimers at the end and having the titles roll from the top to the bottom rather than the other way around.) James Van Der Beek plays Sean Bateman a student at Camden College who spends most of his time dealing drugs and sleeping with women. Sean is attracted to Lauren (Shannyn Sossamon) and is convinced that she has been leaving anonymous love letters in his mailbox. Meanwhile although Lauren isnt indifferent to Sean she has given her heart to her bum of a boyfriend Victor (Kip Pardue) who has taken off to spend some time wandering around Europe. It is her intention to lose her virginity to him. (She spends her spare time studying pictures of the effects of STDs in an effort to keep her hormones under control.) Then theres Paul (Ian Somerhalder) who used to date Lauren but is currently exploring his bisexual side and has developed a huge crush on Sean. Sean being self-centered and strictly hetero is oblivious to Pauls feelings. From a visual standpoint The Rules of Attraction is a busy motion picture. The film is filled with flash edits scenes played backward and split screens. At times it works (such as the split-screen sequence in which Sean and Lauren approach one another) but on other occasions its too much. Nevertheless it is hard to deny that Avarys approach gives the movie a kind of restless energy. You may despise all of the characters and view their interactions as shallow and petty but the film is unlikely to bore you. As with Killing Zoe Avary has decided to focus upon a group of nihilistic self-absorbed drugged out individuals. (Another curious similarity a both movies feature clips from silent German expressionist films Nosferatu in Zoe and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari here.) Avarys view of his characters is cynical and unsympathetic sometimes to the point of cruelty. There are times when he wants us to laugh at them and we do. But we dont always feel good about doing it. The Rules of Attraction is not mainstream fare but it is quirky and interesting and worth a look for those who dont mind movies where you end up despising just about everyone who has a speaking part.

Pic fails to translate Ellis to the screen as well as Mary Harrons ""American Psycho"" did. This review was updated on Oct. 7 2002. Brett Easton Elliselectrifying second novel -- about the predilections and peccadilloes of upper-crust college students -- gets an ambitious sometimes inspired but ultimately less than satisfying screen treatment from Roger Avary in ""The Rules of Attraction."" Though a marked improvement over Avarys prior directorial outing the ""Pulp Fiction"" wannabe ""Killing Zoe"" pic fails to translate Ellis to the screen as well as Mary Harrons ""American Psycho"" did. Nihilistic content will likely alienate most general audiences leaving the authors fans and those curious to see an assortment of handsome twentysomething stars playing it down-and-dirty the most likely takers. Setting is the fictitious Camden College (drawn from Ellis experience attending Bennington). A drunken affair between the slacker Sean Bateman (James Van Der Beek playing the younger brother of ""American Psychos"" Patrick Bateman) and preppy Paul Denton (Ian Somerhalder) turns into a one-sided obsession on Pauls behalf as Sean lusts after the seemingly unattainable Lauren Hynde (Shannyn Sossamon). Lauren pines for Victor (Kip Pardue) who is vacationing in Europe. Lauren also once upon a time dated Paul. In Ellis book there is an ambiguity about these affairs -- as Ellis shifts voices from one unreliable narrator to the next -- that leaves the reader wondering what really happened. Unanswered questions make ""Rules"" a compelling read. But given that so much of what is captivating about ""Rules"" on the page is rooted in imprecision Avarys pic represents an adventurous undertaking. Reportedly having labored for more than a decade to bring this project to the screen the writer-director (who won an Oscar for co-writing ""Pulp Fiction"" with Quentin Tarantino) has a feel for Ellis milieu and has come up with a series of innovative approaches to the material including a split-screen technique to complement the novels ""Rashomon"" storytelling. One sequence is brilliant the digital video ""diary"" of Victors globetrotting holiday a full-frontal-assault of sped-up sound image and narration that precisely channels Ellis rambling coked-up patois (and serves as the entree to Avarys planned follow-up film of Ellis ""Glamorama"" in which Victor is the central character). But Avarys film never quite emerges from the shadow of Ellis book; the constraints of a conventional running time have forced Avary to dispose of many subplots and subtext and whats left may at times be incoherent to viewers unfamiliar with the book. So little time is spent developing the Sean-Patrick-Lauren relationship that what once seemed an intriguing and multifaceted love triangle a la ""Dangerous Liaisons"" now barely registers as passing flirtations. While pic never slips into parody as it easily might have neither does it conjure up enough of the icy cynicism bordering on absurdity that is one of Ellis defining characteristic as a writer. Nor does Avary display a steady hand when it comes to setting the tone of the piece. Most egregiously gone is Elllis sweeping sense of pansexuality. And Avarys film offers only fleeting suggestion of the enormous wealth and privilege of its characters -- another of Ellis primary targets. There is also something intangible lost in transposing the time of the film from the mid-1980s to the present. Nonetheless cast performs bravely with Van Der Beek doing much to shed his goody-two-shoes ""Dawsons Creek"" image even if Somerhalder and Sossamon ultimately seem to fit more comfortably into their characters. In brief appearances Fred Savage (as one of Seans druggie ""clients"") and Eric Stoltz (as a lecherous faculty member with a distinctive brogue) also impress. Technical aspects are outstanding particularly Sharon Seymours lovingly detailed production design and Robert Brinkmans adept lensing both of which do much to transform an array of SoCal locations into pics wintry East Coast setting.
