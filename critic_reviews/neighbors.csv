Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne again star as Mac and Kelly Radner youngish suburban parents whose domestic tranquillity is shattered by the revelry of college students renting the house next door. This time the trouble is caused by a new sorority founded by three young women (Chloe Grace Moretz Kiersey Clemons and Beanie Feldstein) at odds with the norms of Greek life. Teddy Sanders (Zac Efron) the first installments self-destructive prince of parties returns bringing a twist of pathos that grounds the comedic action. Teddys frat brothers (including Jerrod Carmichael Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Dave Franco) are back too along with the Radners best friends (Ike Barinholtz and Carla Gallo) and the dean of the college (Lisa Kudrow). The biggest change is political the themes of gay marriage female empowerment endemic sexism and racist harassment by the police crop up alongside the practicalities of real-estate transactions to make the narrative setup far more engaging than the antic--and often merely frantic--set pieces.

"Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; neighbors-2-sorority-rising ) Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising (United States 2016) May 20 2016 A movie review by James Berardinelli Its the same sad story a small movie becomes an unexpected success and for purely financial reasons a sequel is commissioned. The follow-up proves not only to be creatively bankrupt but a disappointment on all levels and thereby tarnishes the perception of its predecessor. Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising isnt the first instance of this happening and it wont be the last. However its depressing to realize that the filmmaking team of director Nicholas Stoller and his four co-writers couldnt have come up with something - anything - better. Instead they have resurrected the awful comedy tropes of the 1980s and emerged with something shockingly lifeless. There are about six really good laughs during the films 92-minute running length. For those who believe this to represent an acceptable rate rush out to see Neighbors 2. Others may find this difficult to watch even as a home rental. For the most part the story is a retread. I suppose thats understandable when one considers the ""if it aint broke dont fix it"" rule. A better solution than enduring the sequel for those who (like me) enjoyed the first movie would be to re-watch that one rather than spending the price of a movie ticket. Even the best parts of Neighbors 2 feel a little stale. This time instead of a fraternity in the house next door to Mac (Seth Rogen) and Kelly (Rose Byrne) Radners abode its a sorority. The movie provides a needlessly in-depth backstory for why three girls - Shelby (Chloe Grace Moretz) Beth (Kiersey Clemons) and Nora (Beanie Feldstein) - go out of their way to reject the universitys existing Greek culture and start a new off-campus sorority. They are ""mentored"" by university alum Teddy Sanders (Zac Efron) the Raders nemesis from Neighbors. Of course things get out of hand a war ensues Teddy is rejected by the girls and joins Team Mac amp; Kelly and... well... you know the rest. The movie unconvincingly offers a message about sexual equality and female empowerment. (On campuses fraternities can have parties but sororities cant - Google it.) This might seem a little less like pandering if the approach wasnt so heavy-handed. The problem isnt the message its the clumsiness with which it is presented. The mealy writing evident in Neighbors 2 isnt going to advance any agenda. Better written female characters would have been a start. The three sorority leads arent exactly ""strong"" women. Theyre more like girls stuck in a state of arrested development. I fail to understand why would-be raunchy comedies feel the need to inject quasi-dramatic elements into the proceedings. It never works it always feels half-baked and it only serves to slow the proceedings. A lot of it feels like filler. Do we care whether Teddy ""finds himself?"" Do we care whether the girls grow as sisters? Do we care whether Mac and Kelly are good parents? No no and no. Yet the screenplay expends about half its running time pursuing these questions. Are six laughs good for 92 minutes? Not when the viewer is forced to endure ten times as much treacle as humor. Maybe the problem is that when I go to a raunchy comedy I expect to have a good time not to be inundated by inept drama. Any edge the first movie possessed has been dulled to insignificance here. The tit-for-tat tactics in the ""war"" between the ex-party animals and the current ones are nowhere near as vicious as they were in Neighbors. Theres some gross stuff to be sure but ""gross"" doesnt automatically equate to ""funny."" So we get moments of comedic gold like Rose Byrne vomiting on Seth Rogens face and used tampons being employed as weapons. Since the first movie made money and the second one is almost guaranteed to follow suit its hard to blame the actors for taking their checks and mailing in their performances or for the writers to do the laziest job imaginable in ""crafting"" the screenplay. This isnt about providing quality entertainment; its about fooling audiences into spending money by offering a familiar title with recognizable actors. Neighbors 2 is a direct-to-video level production. Welcome to how too many movies are made in 2016.

Universal Pictures hide caption toggle caption Universal Pictures Zac Efron and Seth Rogen reunite in Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising. Universal Pictures Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising is likely the first college comedy to show a frat party from a womans perspective and it is scary. The young sorority pledges trudge reluctantly through a creepy house infected by unsupervised male id trying to avoid the grabby hands and drink offerings of their leering hosts. ""Im getting a really rape-y vibe"" one of the girls says as neon signs leading to the bedrooms read ""Stairway to Heaven"" and ""No Means Yes."" But three disgusted freshmen played by Chloe Grace Moretz Kiersey Clemons and Beanie Feldstein decide to build their own heaven instead by launching an off-campus house where they can throw their own parties. In the two short years since the original Neighbors pitted one of those old-school National Lampoon movie fraternities against new parents played by Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne theres been a sea change in popular cultures view of Greek life. Much of that may be due to increased exposure of the sexual assault epidemic on American campuses including how dangerous some frat parties have become for women. When one character instructs another to ""never drink the punch"" like its a well-known fact of life it could be a line from The Hunting Ground. This is a really grim way to set the table for a movie where a shirtless Rogen sprints through a tailgate with a garbage bag full of marijuana. But one of Neighbors 2s unexpected charms is that it touches on such issues without trivializing them. The films turning point is the (very real) fact that the National Panhellenic Conference bans U.S. sorority chapters from consuming alcohol in their own houses. The girls plan to rent the house formerly occupied by Zac Efrons frat crew for partying purposes is an approach that could help curb campus rape in real life. But its nevertheless bad news for the Radners next door (Rogen and Byrne) who have a little girl with another on the way and who have just sold their house in escrow and need to keep shenanigans at bay for 30 days until they can close the deal. And so another generation-gap rivalry begins. The girls refuse to rein in their parties and they are aided at first by Efrons Teddy former campus king turned purposeless mid-twenties sad sack. (Its heartening to find that Van Wilder-style perma-collegedom is no longer something to be emulated.) A running theme throughout the escalating neighbor wars is parenthood The Radners look at the undisciplined girls next door and see their daughters in the future when they no longer will want anything to do with the ""old people"" telling them how to have fun. But this half-hearted attempt to discuss maturation is second to the films true purpose gender-flipping all the first movies jokes about rowdy college kids. Lazy? Maybe but in a Hollywood starving for female-fronted movies of any stripe it still qualifies as revolutionary. The approach allows the women to be instruments of comedy rather than targets of it. Condom jokes become tampon jokes with the sisters verbally challenging the idea that what theyre doing is any more disgusting. When Moretzs character loses her virginity we never even see the partner or the act; we only see the celebration her sisters throw for her (the women have good onscreen chemistry even if they never distinguish themselves as individual characters). And there are long discussions over what does and does not constitute sexism which get more laughs than anything Rogen does with his dad bod for the upteenth time. As was true of the first Neighbors this films construction is rather sloppy. The running gags involving small children dont work characters blab tons of semi-improvised filler and the overall look is cheap. The script also lacks the sense of pushing a concept to the outer limits that Rogen and co-writer Evan Goldberg pulled off so well in Superbad and This Is The End. (They are two of five credited writers all male; the director is Nicholas Stoller who also helmed the first Neighbors and the under-appreciated The Five-Year Engagement.) But the deck is stacked with ace comic performers like Byrne who does a splendid morning-sickness puke and Efron making his hunky boyishness the butt of every joke. And at only 92 minutes the films hurry to rush through its plethora of characters becomes a strength because we dont have enough time to get bored by any one scene. The set pieces may be thin but they show flickers of genuine warmth. ""Lets do what parents do better than anything Stop young people from having fun"" Rogen yells as a rallying cry. But the women of Neighbors 2 for once dont have to stop.

If you live in a tiny apartment and you can hear everything when your neighbors are watching Game of Thrones (or worse) youll have zero sympathy for the noise problems suffered by Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne back in Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising as a married couple with a kid living in a relatively palatial house near a college campus. Last film around a gang of frat boys moved in next door. This time its female students (led by Chloe Grace Moretz) who are sick of sexist taunts and have started their own sorority. This sequel turns out to be a gross-out comedy with a pro-woman streak (instead of sexy selfies or bro-luring bacchanals the sorority throws a ""feminist icon"" party). And it just about works. Once again Zac Efron saves the day. In the original he played the president of the fraternity. Now he takes on a mentor role to the sorority instructing them on the art of debauchery. In return they teach him the ways of feminism ""Dont call them hos--thats not cool anymore"" he tells his buddies. Jokes like this keep Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising just funny enough to not feel like a retread.

If only. Actually the work on this wheres-my-check sequel is more like texting it in -   sloppy writing forced ""LOLs"" and an explosion of exclamation points all ending in a string of emojis. Probably poo emojis. The original ""Neighbors"" like the original ""The Hangover"" had the benefit of some rude originality and a couple of shocking jokes. But ""Neighbors 2"" - like ""The Hangover Part II"" - just repeats all of it set-up for set-up punchline for punchline. Well OK theres one big switch. In the first film homeowners Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne were horrified to find out a fraternity had moved next door. Quickly they began plotting to have them evicted. In this film Rogen and Byrne are horrified to find out a sorority has moved next door. Quickly they begin plotting to have them evicted. So you see totally different. Still old situations are trotted out including lots of scenes with floppy adult toys and a running joke about how much Byrne enjoys down and dirty sex with Rogen. Because you know who wouldnt? Would it surprise you to know Rogens one of the screenwriters? Well then youre going to be shocked when you hear one of the actresses playing a sorority member - an extraordinarily ordinary actress -- is the sister of Rogens old friend Jonah Hill. Its so nice when things work out for relatives of the rich and famous isnt it? It really gives you faith. MORE A few words with Seth Rogen Nepotism aside - and theres some very minor Mamet progeny in the cast too as well as James Francos less-annoying brother Dave returning from the first film -- theres nothing very noticeable about ""Neighbors 2"" and even less thats new Zac Efron - also returning as the beautiful but dumb frat boy Teddy - works hard offering himself up as a beefcake fantasy. But hes been playing this part an awful lot lately and Rogens heh-heh-heh stoner act is about as fresh as last nights bong water. Fresh to the mix is Chloe Grace Moretz as the most rebellious of the sorority sisters and thats briefly encouraging -- shes a sharp young actress who usually deserves better than she gets. But she gets even less here -- her character is tiresome and her antics arent outrageous as much as simply mean or stupid. Its too easy to root against her. In a better movie the sides would be more equally matched. Youd see the point of view of the ""adults"" and of the college students too. Your sympathies would switch back and forth. Here though both sides are simply silly - with things endlessly prolonged and then needlessly escalated. The pace is choppy and uncertain. (Judging by the trailer a lot has been cut including one whole guest star.) A few bits of great physical comedy remain as when Rogen and Efron get locked in a garage. But they could have been taken from - or slipped into - any movie. They have nothing to do with their characters or the plot. Of course this is one of those plots where anyone could end it 15 minutes in by simply calling the police. (Weirdly absolutely no one else seems to live on this big suburban block). But then nobody in this sort of movie ever thinks of ending all this nonsense by calling the cops. Thats what critics in the audience think about. Ratings note The film contains strong language sexual situations underage drinking substance abuse and violence. Also Seth Rogen having sex. Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising (R) Universal (92 min.)

Case in point. Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising is an unexpectedly funny addition to a gross-out college comedy genre youd think would be played out by now. It is smartly-written dumb stuff. Directed by Nicholas Stoller (Get Him to the Greek) and written by the school-buddy writing team of Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg Sorority Rising is that rare comedy sequel that replicates what worked with its predecessor and seamlessly wraps it around a twist. That twist Mac and Kelly the homeowner/parents played by Rogen and Rose Byrne are again at war with the hedonistic progeny of a university Greek Council. But this time its not with a fraternity but with a sorority fighting for its right to party. And as weird as it sounds for a writing team whose next project is called Sausage Party Rogen/Goldberg manage to turn Sorority Rising into a low-brow feminist statement. The plot is inspired by actual practice (the National Pan-Hellenic Conference forbids alcohol in sorority houses but not frats). And when she finds herself pledged by a dimply sorority queen (Selena Gomez) with more rules than her dad young Shelby (Chloe Grace-Moretz) starts her own sorority Kappa Nu with newfound geeky friends Beth (Kiersey Clemons) and Nora (Beanie Feldstein). Their mission to create a hard-partying sanctuary from the ""rapey"" atmosphere of the frats (yes Neighbors 2 dares go there and even includes a Cosby joke). Kappa Nu naturally snags the house next to Mac and Kelly vacated in the first film by the frat boys and their six-pack-abbed president Teddy (Zac Efron). Its not often one recommends Zac Efrons acting. But theres something about Teddy and the lines hes given that hits Efrons literal sweet spot. Here we find him falling behind his bros careers questioning his value and resenting Mac and Kelly for the criminal record he ended up with after the first movie. His lifeline Teddy lands a live-in gig mentoring the girls of Kappa Nu on how to run a sorority like a frat. So the words ""Its on"" are spoken - again - with the sale of Mac and Kellys house in peril. Director Nicholas Stoller indulges his gift for exceedingly violent slapstick in this war between the sisters and the ""old people."" I wont say the comedy isnt gratuitous or crude (picture a house pelted with used tampons) but theres a sweetness to the characters all of whom act out of insecurity. All told Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising is better than anybody had a right to expect.

Case in point. Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising is an unexpectedly funny addition to a gross-out college comedy genre youd think would be played out by now. It is smartly-written dumb stuff. Directed by Nicholas Stoller (Get Him to the Greek) and written by the school-buddy writing team of Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg Sorority Rising is that rare comedy sequel that replicates what worked with its predecessor and seamlessly wraps it around a twist. That twist Mac and Kelly the homeowner/parents played by Rogen and Rose Byrne are again at war with the hedonistic progeny of a university Greek Council. But this time its not with a fraternity but with a sorority fighting for its right to party. And as weird as it sounds for a writing team whose next project is called Sausage Party Rogen/Goldberg manage to turn Sorority Rising into a low-brow feminist statement.

"In Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising Seth Rogen and Zac Efron face their femme fears - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review In Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising Seth Rogen and Zac Efron face their femme fears ""Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising"" Universal Pictures Zac Efron left and Seth Rogen in the comedy ""Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising."" Zac Efron left and Seth Rogen in the comedy ""Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising."" (Universal Pictures) Rebecca KeeganContact Reporter When a concerned dad visits his college-age daughter in ""Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising"" and finds a female party den to rival any beer-soaked lair in ""National Lampoons Animal House"" he asks the logical question ""So you get to be as dumb as the boys now?"" Yep pretty much.Title IX has finally hit the college party movie genre and the result is just as goofily funny and mind-bendingly stupid as its testosterone-driven predecessors. ""Neighbors 2"" has too many characters and some dopey set pieces that seem to have been contrived on the back of a box of rolling papers. But it also manages something tricky and laudable. Embedded among the bong hits and gross-out gags is a witty reframing of some very contemporary cultural conundrums and an unexpected poignancy most notably in Zac Efrons vulnerable performance as Teddy Sanders a reluctantly evolving dudebro. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story In one hilarious epiphanous moment when Teddy slowly realizes that all the ""hoe""-themed parties his fraternity threw over the years were offensive to women its like seeing the apes in ""2001"" discover tools. This is how a bae gets woke. Directed by Nicholas Stoller with a bit less narrative discipline than he showed on the snappier 2014 original ""Neighbors 2"" picks up with Seth Rogen and Rose Byrnes young parents Mac and Kelly Radner as their home has just gone into escrow and their second baby is on the way. With 30 days to close Chloe Grace Moretzs hard-partying sorority moves into the ramshackle house next door threatening Mac and Kellys sale and reigniting the intergenerational warfare the couple waged against Teddys fraternity in the original.Moretzs sharp-eyed sorority president Shelby is a mostly worthy adversary smart enough to question the gender bias of the college Greek system young and naive enough to want to replicate the guys reckless hedonism. None of her wing women are terribly well fleshed out but a rambunctious Beanie Feldstein the little sister of actor Jonah Hill and a game Kiersey Clemons are awfully fun to be around. SNAP Video Official trailer for Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising Official trailer for Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising See more videos ""Neighbors 2"" has so many characters to define -- in addition to introducing the young women of Kappa Nu it memorably revisits the supporting frat brothers from the original played by Dave Franco Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Jerrod Carmichael. Perhaps that why its hard to form much attachment to Moretz and her crew; theyre never on screen for long.The movie also suffers for arriving after an era of groundbreaking girls-just-wanna-have fun TV and movies like ""Broad City"" ""Trainwreck"" and ""Bridesmaids"" which give their female characters more time and more layers. Unlike its thematic sisters this movie has five male writers -- Stoller Rogen Rogens producing partner Evan Goldberg and the duo who wrote the original Andrew Jay Cohen and Brendan OBrien. The good news is these guys appear to have at least a passing familiarity with actual human young women -- when the girls of Kappa Nu dance they leave their high heels piled in the corner; when they go to their first frat party they skip out early because of the ""rapey"" vibe.Byrne whose role as Rogens co-conspirator remains a welcome departure from the wife-as-nag trope is just as funny and subtle as ever. Her futile attempt to bribe college dean Lisa Kudrow in one scene is a study in comedic timing. Rogen amiably revisits his doubt-plagued young dad character but delivers some of the movies funniest moments when hes grappling with a mans place in a changing world. When the sorority girls swarm his car and Byrne turns the garden hose on them Rogen screams with palpable discomfort ""Youre only making them sexier"" When his misguided friend played by Ike Barinholtz attempts a ""mens rights"" fist bump he shudders in disgust.Shot by Rogen regular Brandon Trost ""Neighbors 2"" has more visual style than you might expect of a character-driven comedy especially in a tailgate party heist sequence that sees Efron delivering a ""Magic Mike""-esque dance performance as a means of distraction.But when its at its best is when the movie shows the beating heart underneath Efrons glistening pecs. Like any number of gifted actresses -- Cameron Diaz and Goldie Hawn come to mind -- Efron wields his beautiful body as a comedic instrument. He knows its power and yet yearns to be valued in a deeper way. Its a market the ladies have cornered for too long.

When Mac and Kelly (Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne) braved a bash in 2014s Neighbors it was a bacchanalia of delights a hard-drinking sweaty gyrating fountain of youth foaming from a keg. Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising directed again by Nicholas Stoller takes a second look through the eyes of female freshmen Shelby Beth and Nora. But now the party is a nightmare and this time as the camera winds through the house we see the leers; what was glorious is suddenly gross. After forking over 20 at the door the girls are supposed to give the boys free entertainment on the stripper pole in a kiddie pool of pudding or upstairs in the bedroom. Theyve paid money to be treated like prostitutes. ""It was super rapey in there"" gasps Beth (Kiersey Clemons) gulping in the fresh air of freedom in the front yard. So were on their side when the trio launches an unofficial sorority -- emphasis on un as legit sororities are forbidden to throw their own parties. (""Only frats can"" explains Selena Gomez in a cameo as a prim Phi Lambda president.) To rage these freshman feminists have to go rogue. It just so happens that theres a house for rent the former frat battleground next to Mac and Kellys home. And it even comes with its own ghost Zac Efrons former fraternity president Teddy Sanders whos gone from young prince to pathetic. Thanks to his prank war with the marrieds Teddys criminal record has made it tough to get a job. Worse his best friend Pete (Dave Franco) wants him out of their apartment. Teddy runs barefoot and eerily upright like the T-1000 back to the last place he felt proud and volunteers to help Shelby (Chloe Grace Moretz) Beth and Nora (Beanie Feldstein) launch the coolest sorority in town -- and as a bonus sabotage enemies Mac and Kellys attempts to sell their place and move. Neighbors 2 is a war of idiots. Mac and Kelly still go glassy-eyed when actual grown-ups lecture them on something important and boring -- like say escrow -- which is how the new sorority could bankrupt them if their potential home buyers back out. Alas Byrne saddled with a huge pregnant tummy doesnt get as many good jokes as the last time. Its up to Efron the best dim bulb in the business to make up the difference. His character might be a hot-bodied loser but hes the movies MVP. Teddy cant figure out how to feed himself. When Mac takes pity and teaches him to cook hes astounded by science. ""Why would hot water make eggs hard when it makes pasta soft?"" he asks with deadpan sincerity. The movies real target is Shelby and her pack of shrieking millennials. Moretz Clemons and Feldstein are terrifically funny especially in their casual way of calling thirtysomething Mac and Kelly ""old people"" as though its simply a fact. At first their crusade is inspiring. Im way jealous of their Feminist Icon Party with pledges costumed like Oprah and three versions of Hillary Clinton senator first lady and future president. Yet we start to see that the girls spot misogyny everywhere -- even when it doesnt exist. They scream ""Sexist"" like toddlers who just learned the word ""no."" Both words have a magical ability to cut short conversation. We are navigating a moment where every group even white men is quick to take offense. But Neighbors 2s Social Justice Warrior critique would feel less sour if it werent written by five white guys. I guess this is still their party after all.

Rated R (profanity crude and sexual humor drug abuse involving teens nudity). The ""Neighbors 2"" creative team is a sausage party (five writers and a director all dudes) struggling to prove their feminism. Its kind of cute but mostly just awkward somewhere between watching bros who slept through French class trying to work their game in Nice and endless CBS sitcoms about nutty guys ruled by exasperated boring women. Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne return as homeowners this time trying to sell their house which is in escrow for 30 days (cue a funny bit on how no one understands what escrow is). The vacant house next door formerly a haunt of frat king Teddy (Zac Efron) this time is taken over by a sorority started by three outcast friends (Chloe Grace Moretz Kiersey Clemons Beanie Feldstein). Theyre determined to prove theyre as disgusting as guys which means moldy pizza and throwing used tampons at their disapproving neighbors. Teddy becomes an ally of the old marrieds next door and theres a lot of rules-police talk about what is and isnt sexist. Political correctness may not be the death of comedy but its at least the stage 4 cancer of comedy PC means terror of giving offense but this is a movie in which somebody upchucks on somebody during sex and there are a half-dozen scenes of babies playing with sex toys. The boys (co-writer Rogen co-writer and director Nicholas Stoller et al.) want to be up-to-the-minute but unfortunately for them this minute is wholly owned by PC Inc. You can feel them battling their instincts Their idea of funny is girls in bikinis attacking Rogen in a car while theyre being sprayed with a hose but since this is venturing into Adam Sandler territory the idea quickly gets dropped. Two of Teddys bros decide theyre gay and want to get married but theres no conflict in the situation and everybodys really happy and huggy about it. Hugs Not funny. And after the homeowners and the Greek girls spend much of the movie pranking each other Byrne gives a female-empowerment speech and everyone instantly becomes friends. Female-empowerment speeches Less funny than hugs. You can sense the writers proclaiming to one another that noticing any differences between girls and boys is wrong except in the old CBS sense that to be male is to be lame. (There are a couple of quick caricatures of ""rapey"" frat guys but the comedy is so broad it doesnt sting.) So even when they stumble into promising territory such as when Teddy is telling the ladies that selling 7 pounds of weed isnt a great idea and they instantly form a new clique and eject him behind his back (using phones) the joke is dropped instead of building to something. If earlier Rogen and Stoller movies mined experience for laughs this one is so contrived that its like it began life as a checklist of things that are supposed to be funny today.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Stephanie Merry May 19 Follow stephmerry Mac (Seth Rogen) has a new problem in ""Neighbors 2"" as the homeowner pleads with a new sorority -- uninterested in the sexist double standards of campus Greek life -- to pause their partying. (Chuck Zlotnick/Universal Pictures) For all the gross-out humor -- graphic vomiting tampon hurling and a cameo appearance by a scrotum -- ""Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising"" is a surprisingly progressive film. Youll still hear a frat guy say ""bros before hos"" in the movie but at least this time someone corrects him. ""Dont call them hos"" a character scolds. ""Thats not cool anymore."" The plot however remains largely unchanged from the first go-round. As in ""Neighbors"" Mac and Kelly (Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne) are parents of a young daughter although this time they have another girl on the way. Theyre hardly Mom and Dad of the Year what with 2-year-old Stellas favorite plaything being a sex toy dressed like a princess. But they do their best and theyre looking forward to moving into a larger nicer home. The only hitch in their plan is selling their current house. The good news is the fraternity from the last movie has moved out of the house next door and a family is interested in Mac and Kellys home. The bad news? These prospective buyers will probably back out as soon as they discover that the next-door neighbors are a lawless upstart sorority. The renegade sisterhood is the creation of Shelby (Chloe Grace Moretz) a perpetually high college freshman whos horrified to find out that sororities arent allowed to throw parties. (Only frats can do that.) Shelby bucks the system by forming her own group house with buddies Beth (Kiersey Clemons) and Nora (Beanie Feldstein) plus a slew of other young women. After they rent a house off campus they vow to throw fun shindigs devoid of the bumping grinding and ""roofies"" of a traditional frat bash. The costume party for example where guests dress up as feminist icons promises plenty of alcohol and drugs -- along with three Hillary Clintons. Mac (Seth Rogen) and Kelly Radner (Rose Byrne) are expecting their second child and preparing to move out of their house but are once again plauged by partying neighbors. This time its not a frat - its a sorority. (Universal) Mac and Kelly try to reason with the girls asking them to keep it down just until the buyers have closed on the house but its no use. So begins yet another battle between neighbors only this time the ""olds"" must enlist the aid of their onetime nemesis from the 2014 film former Delta Psi president Teddy (Zac Efron) to help them. The movie isnt much to look at. The editing is ham-handed and the direction by Nicholas Stoller is only passable. But the jokes are surprising timely reminding viewers of the ways men and women are held to different standards. In addition to that socially conscious twist theres also a gay marriage to plan Teddys best friend Pete (Dave Franco) has come out of the closet since the last movie. Then theres the black cop (Jerrod Carmichael) who wonders why he of all people would need a body camera ""Its not like Im going to shoot myself."" Theres also equal-opportunity ogling. Sure theres a wet T-shirt contest or two but the camera also pays just as much attention to Teddys ripped physique which is occasionally clad in nothing but teeny tiny shorts. (Rogen gets the same treatment although his six-pack abs are painted on.) In the end the plot is the least interesting part of the movie. One-upmanship gets old fast but evolved of-the-moment comedy helps make a stale story fresh. R. At area theaters. Contains strong language drug use teen partying and crude sexual content including brief graphic nudity. 94 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Most comedy sequels are cheap cash-ins that make me break out in hives. So it was a delightful surprise that the follow-up to 2014s so-so frat house farce ""Neighbors"" is a solid improvement an enormously likable film. They share a lightweight summer tone adults-versus-students theme and simple story lines but the latest version shows how carefully recycled materials can create very good products. ""Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising"" returns agreeable personalities to the screen adds clever new ideas and polishes the premises it repeats. The film opens on a happy note for Mac and Kelly Radner (Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne). Two years previous the bonehead fraternity that operated next door drove them to distraction. They were loud after hours made the couple feel like no-longer-hip couch potatoes and much to Macs chagrin werent too sharing with their weed. Now the brotherhood has moved on their home base is empty and a generation gap cease-fire is in effect. The Radners preparing for their second child are selling their house and moving up. Across town their frenemy from the earlier film the eternally shirtless fitness god Teddy (Zac Efron) is finding it hard to keep a post-grad job or apartment and dreaming about moving back into his now-deserted old home. The trio are reunited for good and ill when college newcomer Shelby (Chloe Grace Moretz) decides to turn the abandoned building into her own Partysaurus with a Greek letter title and recruits Teddy as their big brother/mentor. Which means the Radners house wont sell. Let the smackdown begin with every character a colorful pinata full of sex jokes drug jokes ethnic jokes and rocket-powered slapstick. The tribal rivalry between the ages is well honed here. The film operates in five jokes a minute territory while giving each side a solid logical skill set. The Radners who are seriously freaked out that their new neighbors view them as boring ""old people"" are reasonably thoughtful. Even Teddy proves too senior-citizen for the new arrivals triggering him to side protectively with the Radners warning them that ""Theres no I in sorority."" Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising  out of 4 stars Rating R for crude sexual content including brief graphic nudity language throughout drug use and teen partying. And while almost everything the new Greek sisters do is a dumb beginners mistake they are like totally technologically educated. A sequence in which they sabotage the Radners efforts by hacking their smartphones is clever enough to make Edward Snowden burst into applause. And while there are plenty of sexist jokes here they hit both ways and the girls are presented as people who are as funny as anyone else. The film which Rogen co-wrote is a running gag about how the generation gap hits everyone. Cameos by Lisa Kudrow as the cut-you-no-slack principal and Kelsey Grammer as Shelbys father show that no one controls hard-boiled teenagers. Rogen and Byrnes brow-wrinkling worries about staying connected to their children show that those problems are coming on fast. Efron has some of the biggest laugh-out-loud moments by playing his dimwit character straight giving Teddy insecurities about aging even though hes a new Mercedes-Maybach hard body. Its fun to see a well-made lowbrow movie where even walk-through characters are so individual and idiosyncratic. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Theres feminism natch because these women gotta fight for their right to party. But theres also loads of unrelated anxiety about being a parent the two year olds favorite plaything is Moms vibrator and her baby sister is on the way And also about growing up and finding your way in the world when former frat king Zac Efrons old bestie -- out and proud and also engaged -- asks him to move out Zac finds hes a hot hunk of lonely manboy. It might have worked if everyone involved had maybe cared a little more (Efron at least commits) and/or tied everything together but instead we get dangling ball sacks and breech baby feet pointless Holocaust jokes and the declaration that throwing bloody tampons is both funny and empowering. Oh and vomit. Still the cartoon-style scramble over a garbage bag full of weed at a football tailgate is kind of a delight.

Loved that movie. Dopey but great. The tagline for the wacky weed-filled sexy cheerfully offensive comedy ""Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising"" would be something more along the lines of ""The Irresponsible Selfish Unlikable Parents Against the Bratty Self-Entitled Lawbreaking Teenagers."" Yeah doesnt quite have the same ring to it. I had a mixed reaction to ""Neighbors"" in 2014 but ultimately gave it a qualified recommendation because there was a solid percentage of genuine laughs to be mined from the R-rated hijinks pitting young newlyweds Mac and Kelly Rudner (Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne) against the Frat Next Door led by Zac Efrons vainglorious Teddy and Dave Francos nutty and intense Pete. The sequel is equally fearless and in-your-face whether the gags involve young women hurling recently used tampons at their enemies; a pregnant woman vomiting onto her husbands face during intercourse; a babys foot seen dangling from ANOTHER pregnant woman; a roofie joke about Bill Cosby or an overweight young woman catapulted through the windshield of a car. Problem is none of that stuff is particularly funny. Its mostly juvenile desperate and disgusting. Even worse ""Neighbors 2"" cynically tries to make a feminist statement amidst all the downright nasty behavior exhibited by the fledgling sorority sisters who have moved next door to the Rudners. To be sure these young women have a legitimate cause in fighting against double standards and the ""Bros Before Hos"" mentality of some fraternities -- but its a little tough to root for them after theyve engaged in vile and criminal antics to take down their new next-door neighbors. Sure were horrible people who dont blink at destroying the lives of our enemies -- but gosh isnt it terrible when men leer at us? Yes it is. Also you might want to rethink how YOU treat your fellow human beings. Plus didnt it occur to director and co-writer Nicholas Stoller and the team of co-writers including Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg that if youre going to include a female empowerment story line in your collegiate comedy you shouldnt portray every single one of the young female students as utter dimwits who keep reminding us they know nothing about anything? The contrived circumstances of the sequel Mac and Kelly are ready to move to the suburbs especially now that daughter Stella (played by twins Zoey Vargas and Elise Vargas) will soon have a little sister. (A running joke about Stella She likes to walk around with her mothers sexual aid and bring it out whenever someone is visiting. Ha. Ha. Ha.) Theyve sold the house -- but theres a 30-day escrow period in which the buyers can back out if they foresee any problems. Cue the entrance of Chloe Grace Moretzs Shelby and her new best friends Beth (Kiersey Clemons) and Nora (Beanie Feldman) who were so mortified by the leering sexism they encountered at their first frat party they decided to form their own sorority and move into the house next door to the Rudners -- the same house from which Efrons Teddy and the frat boys created such havoc just a few years prior. Through a series of developments not worth delving into Teddy winds up joining the Rudners in their manic efforts to shut down the hard-partying sorority lest the new buyers stop by one night take one look at the madness happening next door and back out of the deal. (As was the case with the first ""Neighbors"" apparently nobody lives in any of the other homes on the block. The sorority parties are so over-the-top homeowners from blocks away should be calling the cops.) The sole purpose of the newly formed Kappa Nu sorority is to prove female students can get as wasted and behave as stupidly as their male counterparts. Yeah I know its a comedy but the filmmakers are the ones who introduced social issues. Theres not a moment when any of these young women even talks about attending class or doing some good. Their biggest projects are cornering the market on campus pot so they can sell tons of weed and committing actual felonies against the Rudners. As for Mac and Kelly theyre horrible parents who keep asking each other if theyre horrible parents. Answer YES. Rogen and Byrne are immensely likable and truly talented actors and they have a wonderful natural chemistry together -- but theres only so much the duo can produce when theyre saddled with playing such shallow morons. Efron spends much of the movie taking his shirt off and flexing usually for alleged comedic effect. Efrons a gamer but hes a long way from making a Channing Tatum-like transition from Sculpted Male Sex Object to Actor to Be Reckoned With. I couldnt wait for this movie to end. 1/2 Universal Pictures presents a film directed by Nicholas Stoller and written by Stoller Seth Rogen Evan Goldberg Andrew Jay Cohen and Brendan OBrien. Running time 92 minutes. Rated R (for crude sexual content including brief graphic nudity language throughout drug use and teen partying). Opens Friday at local theaters.

VPCA not-so-original sequel in which parents must again deal with unwelcome neighbors only this time its a sorority.Mac (Seth Rogen) is on the run in ""Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising.""(Photo Universal Pictures)Story HighlightsCritics rating 3 out of 5 starsIn ""Neighbors"" the raunchy 2014 comedy hit Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne fended off the wild fraternity that moved in next door.That film made more than 150 million so a sequel was likely. And now its here and its way different. In ""Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising"" the raunchy comedy follow-up Rogen and Byrne fend off the wild sorority that moves in next door.So there you have it. Progress.Theres more trouble next door for Kelly (Rose Byrne) and Mac (Seth Rogen) in ""Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising."" (Photo Universal Pictures)Thats not entirely a smart-aleck evaluation of what certainly sounds like a retread (and lets face it its a comedy sequel so in some respects it is). Theres a weird attempt at feminism here that doesnt quite fly - basically it boils down to young women having every bit as much right to do bong hits all day and night as young men do - but at least there is an attempt.RELATED The big guide to summer moviesFar better is a depiction of two former frat brothers in love and planning their marriage. Its handled without a trace of a smirk or a raised eyebrow just two people in love working on their future. One of them is Pete (Dave Franco) who you may recall as one of the bigger party animals of Delta Psi Beta in the first film. Like almost everyone else in the fraternity hes moved on with his life.Rose Byrne Seth Rogen and Zac Efron star in ""Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising."" (Photo Universal Pictures)Teddy (Zac Efron)? Not so much. His career at Abercrombie amp; Fitch has gone south since the store started making him wear his shirt to work. And like Mac (Rogen) and Kelly (Byrne) in the first film hes starting to feel a little older - he had to fill in at work so his boss could go to prom.Speaking of Mac and Kelly theyre expecting a second child news we learn in particularly disgusting fashion. Theyve sold their house and bought a bigger one in the suburbs but its in escrow (a term they dont know the meaning of as we see in a funny bit) so they have to keep things calm for a month.AZCENTRALThings To Do app Get the best in events dining and travel right on your deviceMeanwhile Shelby (Chloe Grace Moretz) a freshman is appalled to learn that sororities are not allowed to have parties. (She learns this when Selena Gomez in a cameo as the sorority president makes her put out her joint.) Shelby and a couple of friends (Kiersey Clemons Beanie Feldstein) go to a frat party but hate the date-rape culture so they decide to start a sorority of their own.Chlore Grace Moritz and Zac Efron star in ""Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising."" (Photo Universal Pictures)Right next door to Mac and Kelly of course - with Teddy as their self-appointed adviser.What follows is similar to what happened in the first movie. Mac and Kelly ask the women to keep it quiet they dont and the whole thing escalates. None of that matters all that much really. What does is whether its funny and it often is. Director Nicholas Stoller doesnt have any more luck stringing the story together than he did the first time around but he knows how to get a laugh.Mac (Seth Rogen) tries to navigate this way through the sorority girls taking over his yard in ""Neighbors 2."" (Photo Universal Pictures)The entire cast is once again willing to go all in. But while there was a sort of hidden poignancy in Mac and Kellys struggles with aging out of the frat-house demographic in the first film this time around its Teddy who is facing adulthood sort of. (Its a work in progress; he doesnt know that boiling water is you know hot.) Efron manages to make his looks and physique work both ways - hes always stripping his shirt off but with a self-aware wink and nod. Hes an increasingly interesting actor.MORE AZCENTRAL ON SOCIAL Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | PinterestBut ""Neighbors 2"" never quite escapes the shadow of its predecessor despite the occasional intriguing nod toward equality.

Asked if hed like to help his former rivals Mac (Seth Rogen) and Kelly (Rose Byrne) combat the loud sorority thats moved in next door to them Teddys face suddenly lights up. ""Would that be ... of value to you?"" he asks plaintively. With that Neighbors 2 confirms that its comedy lies in the crisis of the prototypical hot dude--one whose significance shockingly isnt automatically taken for granted. Related Story Bad Neighbors If the first Neighbors (released in 2014) was about Mac and Kellys overblown worrying about getting old and irrelevant after the birth of their first child this sequel is about Teddys deeper more hysterical fear the death of traditional masculinity itself. Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising is a wonderfully goofy sequel light on plot and heavy on silly set pieces but its anchored by a sense of self-awareness that bro comedies often lack poking fun at the insecurities of the millennial male without ever coming off as forced or preachy.Picking up two years after the first films battle between the homeowners Mac and Kelly and the hard-partying fraternity next door Neighbors 2 finds Teddy at a crossroads in life. His roommate and best friend Pete (Dave Franco) is getting married to his boyfriend (John Early) in a rare and heartening subplot for a broad Hollywood comedy that contains exactly no ""gay panic"" jokes or crass asides to the audience. Teddy lost his job as a shirtless model at Abercrombie amp; Fitch a casualty of evolved thinking on the matter and hes wandering through life in search of meaning.He finds it in the form of the new student Shelby (Chloe Grace Moretz) whos starting her own sorority at his old frat house in opposition to the strictures of Greek life on campus. All Shelby and her friends want to do is party in their own space and on their own terms (sororities arent traditionally allowed to throw parties--only frats can) and in attempting to do so next door to Mac and Kelly now trying to sell their place she provokes their wrath.Like the first Neighbors there are no real villains here Everybody has a right to be annoyed and the ensuing shenanigans are mostly harmless fun. But theres an interesting subtle rejection of the first films dynamics at work. An early scene where Shelby and her friends attend a frat party and are confronted with the medley of disgusting girl-thirsty fools who populated Neighbors works as a clever little reversal. Later when they tell Teddy that every soiree his frat threw was along the lines of ""bros and hoes"" the film takes much pleasure in showing Teddys dim handsome face puzzling that point out.Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising is anchored by a sense of self-awareness that bro comedies often lack.If Neighborss standout performance was the wonderfully cranky Byrne (whose character railed against the idea that she had tap out of the films antic warfare just because she was a new mother) Efron is the star of Neighbors 2. The director Nicholas Stoller and his five credited screenwriters (including himself Rogen and Rogers writing partner Evan Goldberg) tap into the tragic hilarity of the dumb attractive marquee idol. All Teddy thinks he has to offer are his perfect abs and he eventually turns on Shelbys sorority when they dismiss him for being too old and level-headed. Efron plays Teddy like a Greek statue come to life and wanders the planet in search of friendship--he has no romantic subplot no desire for money and power. Hes just afraid of becoming irrelevant while everyone else grows up around him.Efron is buoyed by the films impressively deep cast. His old frat buddies played by Jerrod Carmichael and Christopher Mintz-Plasse return as does the neighborhood cop played by Hannibal Burress Mac and Kellys whacked-out couple friends Jimmy and Paula (Ike Barinholtz and Carla Gallo) and Lisa Kudrows frustrating college dean. The film also manages to find ample screentime for Moretz and her sorority sidekicks to cut loose especially the demented Beanie Feldstein (sister to Rogens former sidekick Jonah Hill) and the laid-back Kiersey Clemons (wonderful in last years more serious coming-of-age comedy Dope).In Neighbors 2 Rogen and Byrne return as the lovable lived-in couple Mac and Kelly getting ready for a second child and worrying that theyve screwed up their first (now an adorable toddler) are less worried about growing up this time. Their war with Shelbys sorority is a little more half-hearted and the films set pieces dont devolve into the brutally hilarious violence of the first film. But that works to Neighbors 2s advantage Its easy to enjoy the madcap antics when youre rooting for all sides at once. The stakes are low the jokes are mostly simple and gross but the film as a whole is so surprisingly clever that it doesnt matter.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

Carla Gallo (background left) Rose Byrne Seth Rogen Ike Barinholtz and Zac Efron star in ""Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising."" Photo Chuck Zlotnick Associated Press Neighbors 2 is a little bit funny 1 / 3 Back to Gallery ""Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising"" has too many talented people involved in it for it not to be at least a little bit funny. But thats all it is a little bit funny. Over the course of its hour and a half running time it inspires maybe three loud guffaws a few modest chortles a subsonic chuckle and a handful of silent smiles. Thats not enough to make it a worthy -- or even worth-making -- sequel to the 2014 comedy ""Neighbors."" The movies problems are peculiar because they almost seem contradictory. On the one hand the set-up is so obvious so designed to re-create the dynamics of the original movie that it seems either a purely cynical exercise or so blatant a cynical exercise that it qualifies as a bold comic gesture In the previous film a newly married couple had to contend with a fraternity moving in next door; this time a sorority takes over the same house. The jokes are as coarse as the strategy is deliberate. As the movie begins we see the young married couple (Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne) having sex and then she throws up on him. Actually its one of the best laughs in the movie as well as a cautionary example. Had she been on the bottom she might have died from aspiration and that wouldnt have been funny. Yet for all the movies boldness its coarseness its in-your-faceness ""Neighbors 2"" is constrained by political correctness. The sorority is at least as bad as the fraternity ever was but because the couple is fighting girls the movie has less fun with it. The girls act like villains but the screenplay is unwilling to present them unsympathetically. The upshot is that ""Neighbors 2"" is mostly unpleasant without being funny or ultimately satisfying. The screenplay ties itself into a knot from the start when it presents the founding of the nasty sorority as a feminist event. Young Shelby (Chloe Grace Moretz) is disheartened to find out that sororities under national Greek rules cant throw parties. She is further disillusioned when she attends a frat party and finds the experience sexist and degrading. And so she joins forces with three new friends to establish a new sorority independent of the Greek system. In the new sorority they throw parties that are just as loud and lewd and awful as the frat parties though the movie expects us to recognize a difference that isnt there. In any case the parties are a source of misery to next-door neighbors Mac (Rogen) and Kelly (Byrne) who dont realize that whats keeping them up at night isnt mere raucousness selfishness and noise but burgeoning feminist assertion. Meanwhile the movie makes it plain that this is coming at the worst possible time for the couple Theyve bought a new house and need to sell the old one which theyre currently occupying. But the sorority has made their property unsellable. In ""Neighbors"" the culprits were young men and so director Nicholas Stoller and the screenwriters felt at liberty to present them as slobs -- not evil but ridiculous. By treating the sorority sisters of ""Neighbors 2"" with kid gloves they rob them of humor and inadvertently make them more culpable (and therefore more dislikable) with every awful thing they do. Theyre just not funny. And neither is Zac Efron as Teddy who was the fraternity leader last time and here is presented as pathetic and needy. Yet even with so-so material Rogen is funny and so is Byrne whose comic facility was the revelation of the first ""Neighbors."" But theyre so sympathetic that theres little joy in witnessing their victimhood. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic. Email mlasallesfchronicle.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Most of the time Zac Efron isnt a very good actor. In projects as varied as That Awkward Moment We Are Your Friends Dirty Grandpa The Paperboy and At Any Price hes had opportunities to play all manners of comedy drama and romance and he approaches it all with the same himbo blankness. Yet something happens to Efron when he plays Teddy Sanders the frat-boy frenemy of new parents Mac (Seth Rogen) and Kelly (Rose Byrne) in Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising just as it did in the original Neighbors. Efron imbues his handsome-dope routine with such nuance that Teddy is not only funny but also touching in his sincere desire for brotherhood in short supply postgraduation. What could have been simplistic self-parody becomes a genuinely almost confusingly terrific performance. Its not just that the Neighbors 2 screenwriters (a five-man team) write better jokes for Efron than he gets anywhere else though they do. Their screenplay also approaches Teddy and every other character in Neighbors 2 with a real sense of empathy that goes a long way toward mitigating the pointlessness of making a Neighbors 2 at all. The first film worked fine on its own as a story of generational conflict between two groups that didnt want to believe they could be in a generational conflict the formerly cool young parents and their friendly neighborhood frat boys. In the comedy-sequel tradition Neighbors 2 replays the dynamic from the first movie but more so. Now Mac and Kelly have a second baby on the way and want to sell their house not just get a good nights sleep. Just as their potential sale enters escrow (which involves a funny scene in which they admit that they dont actually remember what escrow is or how it works) a sorority starts renting the house next door where Teddys fraternity used to rage. Teddy re-enters the picture as a mentor to Kappa Nu the sorority formed by Shelby (Chloe Grace Moretz) Beth (Dopes Kiersey Clemons) and Nora (Beanie Feldstein) three freshmen girls who are appalled to learn that ""real"" sororities arent actually allowed to throw parties just attend those thrown by frats. (The movie stresses that this is ""an actual real thing"" ""Google it"" advises one character talking to new pledges but also the audience.) This misfit trio founds Kappa Nu to throw ragers based on their own whims rather than subjecting themselves to fratty objectification. As with Efrons buddies from the first film the Kappa Nu girls arent malicious; they genuinely like each other and want to have a better time in college than they did as high-school outcasts.But where Kappa Nu sees sisterhood Mac and Kelly see crazy parties that could scare their buyers out of the deal. Once again they find themselves pitted against young people whose rituals mystify them. This feels less like a rehash than it should because Rogen director/co-writer Nicholas Stoller and the three other credited screenwriters weave together an entire broad demographics worth of comic anxieties covering life changes from 18 to 35 The Kappa Nu girls want to cement their friendships Mac and Kelly fret about whether theyre suitable parents (and whether their daughter will grow up into a terrifying party monster) and Teddy is caught in the middle as he notices his twentysomething friends reaching milestones before him.Its this quarter-life crisis that allows Efron to shine underplaying his dimness to masterfully sell both a series of dumb-guy jokes (like a distraught shoeless run that leaves him limping or his purely circumstantial ability to do math) and a sweetly clumsy desire to be ""of value"" to the people around him. Efron isnt the only performer who rises to the occasion. Moretz has rarely shaken her over-emotive kid-actor tics this confidently. Rogen and Byrne are old pros at this point and they remain great fun as a married couple well-matched in their good intentions and dopey impulses. (Byrnes Kelly is if possible even less of a sensible wife than she was last time around.)The performers goose the many laughs more often than the filmmaking. Visually speaking director Stollers steady improvement may have plateaued; Neighbors 2 is a little more jittery and rushed than the first film jamming more characters into an even shorter running time. Stoller seems to save up all of his set-piece ambitions for a delirious sequence set at a massive tailgate party involving a theft foot chase and several skirmishes scored to the Kanye West song ""Black Skinhead"" and less inventively but still satisfyingly the Beastie Boys ""Sabotage."" But if this story isnt as conceptually immediate or clearly executed as its predecessor it makes a lot of sharp points about male-female double standards aging and the acceleration of intergenerational conflicts. Its also very funny. For Rogen that makes it one more good comedy among many. Within the Efron filmography though this may stand as a masterpiece.

WARNING Contains crude language and hand gestures. VPCTeddy (center Zac Efron) befriends a crew of college girls in ""Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising.""(Photo Chuck Zlotnick)With Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising the raunchy college comedy is graduating to smart feminist commentary.Make no mistake director Nicholas Stollers entertaining sequel ( out of four; rated R; in theaters Friday) hasnt grown up that much -- there are drug-fueled parties aplenty and one running joke involves a toddler and a sex toy. But Rising levels up the franchise while subtly being its own Greek chorus with men-children struggling with adulthood and a sisterhood finding its way.Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne return as Mac and Kelly Radner admittedly ""the worst parents ever"" some time after they last had to deal with a raucous fraternity living next door. Theyve sold their house -- opting for a bigger place since Kellys pregnant with their second child -- and since its now in escrow all they have to do is keep things quiet for a month.USA TODAYZac Efron The new R-rated comedy kingEnter freshman girl Shelby (Chloe Grace Moretz) and her fellow forward-thinking friends of Kappa Nu. After a rush event at a decidedly frou-frou sorority where they learn about not being able to throw shindigs the girls decide to create their own organization and become the next neighbors from hell for the Radners. Even worse for the couple Kappa Nus getting help from Teddy (Zac Efron) the frat-boy foil from the first film.Neighbors 2 falls back on the originals story beats as a template -- such as the escalating tensions between the parents and the rowdy kids plus the Big Freaking Final Party -- though at least its self-aware that its doing it. The sequel script co-written by Stoller Rogen and others is a step-up in terms of offensive fun There are some joke grenades that take a few seconds to hit but turn out to be blistering.USA TODAYChloe Grace Moretz Brooklyn Beckham make their red carpet debut for Neighbors 2Yet what the film does with the Kappa Nu girls is actually unexpectedly enlightening. Instead of caring about boys and being sex objects for male amusement theyre all about throwing away their high heels dancing in socks and having a feminist icon dress-up bash (with multiple Hillary Clintons) -- that is until they inevitably start to become exactly what they hate. (Take note of newcomer Beanie Feldstein a younger funnier version of Rebel Wilson who is downright Belushi-esque.)Also Neighbors 2 manages to make its most obvious dudebro its secret weapon. With pecs and abs that seem more like special effects Teddy continues his state of arrested development but begins to realize hes caught between being young enough to have his future ahead of him but being old enough to be -- at least to a pack of college-age girls -- kind of a lame-o buzzkill.Efron tackles these scenes with expressive gusto from dealing with the upcoming marriage of his best frat friend (Dave Franco) to figuring out that his ""bros before hoes"" world view is a wee bit sexist. And in turn Neighbors 2 reminds everyone in funny fashion that its not a bad lesson on the whole. 730 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/27CTtOC",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/05/19/review-neighbors-2-sorority-rising-movie/84548656/,200,neighbors20,neighbors,usatoday

Photo Credit Universal Studios / Chuck Zlotnick advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Two parents watch their real estate values plummet when a sorority moves in next door.CAST Seth Rogen Chloe Grace Moretz Zac EfronRATED R (Vulgar humor and language)LENGTH 125BOTTOM LINE About what youd expect from this sequel a weak story and a few good jokes. After the success of 2014s ""Neighbors"" starring Seth Rogen as a home-owning father and Zac Efron as the rowdy frat boy who moves in next door there was only one way the sequel could go ""Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising"" is the female-oriented follow-up in which the girls prove just as outrageous as the boys. That shouldnt come as a surprise to anyone familiar with girls or to anyone whos been following Hollywoods attempts to make amends for decades of male-dominated comedies. In the wake of ""Bridesmaids"" ""Trainwreck"" ""Sisters"" and many a Melissa McCarthy movie ""Neighbors 2"" arrives with a feminist mandate and an eagerness to give women equal opportunity in the raunch department. None of the films five writers is a woman however and it shows. advertisement | advertise on newsday Not that the movie isnt occasionally funny. Rogen and Efron are once again well-matched as schlubby Mac and chiseled Teddy this time teaming up against the Kappa Nus led by Chloe Grace Moretz in a somewhat wobbly performance as Shelby a renegade stoner. The Kappas are appalled that college sororities are barred from serving alcohol so they fight for their right to party by moving off-campus next to hapless Mac and his wife Kelly (Rose Byrne). ""Neighbors 2"" wants to overturn old stereotypes and stigmas but isnt sure how to go about it. The Kappas berate Teddy for his macho insensitivity (it never occurred to him that all those ""ho"" themed parties were demeaning) yet hes also completely accepting of his gay friend Pete (Dave Franco). The Kappas refuse to demean themselves sexually but the movie does it for them hosing them down and pressing them ""accidentally"" against Macs windshield. Whenever ""Neighbors 2"" cant reconcile its opposing sensibilities it defaults to safe mode gross jokes about vomit and tampons. ""Neighbors 2"" deserves credit for focusing on women who want equality and respect but the writers -- including Rogen and director Nicholas Stoller -- cant quite turn these women into real people. Only once when the Kappas humiliate themselves by donning lingerie to raise money for their home do we really feel for them. ""Neighbors 2"" might have benefited from a little gender diversity behind the camera as well as in front of it.

EntertainmentMovies Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising Tasteless sequel moves in Originally published May 19 2016 at 1200 am Updated May 19 2016 at 222 pm Movie review of ""Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising"" This supposed comedy starts in the subbasement of taste and there it stays all the way to the end. Rating 1 star out of 4. Share story By Soren AndersenSpecial to The Seattle Times When a movie opens with a wife vomiting onto her husbands face during coitus and then introduces their toddler playing with a sex toy a question immediately pops to mind Where can it go from here? When the supposed comedy youre being exposed to starts in the subbasement of taste you might think the only direction things go from there is up. Think again. Movie Review    Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising with Seth Rogen Zac Efron Rose Byrne Chloe Grace Moretz. Directed by Nicholas Stoller from a screenplay by Stoller Rogen Andrew Jay Cohen Brendan OBrien and Evan Goldberg. 94 minutes. Rated R for crude sexual content including brief graphic nudity language throughout drug use and teen partying. Several theaters. ""Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising"" cant go any lower -- subbasements are as low as it gets -- but it goes no higher either. Straight line flatline on and on to more of the same.

And from a Cosby joke uttered at a party where the punch has been spiked with the date-rape drug Rohypnol to a casually() tossed-off joke() featuring the words ""a Jew in the oven"" ""Neighbors 2"" takes adolescent glee in being offensive for offensiveness own curdled sake. Returning are stars Zac Efron Rose Byrne and Seth Rogen who also co-wrote the script along with four other credited writers. It took five writers to come up with this. The mind reels. The original pitted the married-with-infant and coping-with-adulthood characters played by Rogen and Byrne against the noisy wild partying frat boys living next door headed by Efrons character. For the sequel the frat louts are gone but a group of freshmen college girls -- led by a character played by Chloe Grace Moretz -- move into the now-vacant frat house with the intent of forming a party-hearty sorority. This brings them into conflict with the next-door parents. A war of mean-spirited pranks ensues. The gender politics are very strange as the young ladies want to be as crass as the guys -- drink drug sex it up -- because that is somehow perceived to be empowering. The characters without exception are disagreeable idiots shrilly performed. Mark this one down as a sequel that should never have been made.

As in name one thats better than the original. Aliens T-2 just about every title gets shot down. Finally a student says hes got one The Godfather Part II.Well add Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising to that rarefied list. Taking off from the 2014 goofball original - about a couple terrorized by the frat brothers next door - Neighbors 2 brings back most of the principals from the first movie and then amps up the conflict by introducing a renegade band of college sisters.Led by the earnest stoner Shelby (ChloA<< Grace Moretz) the freshmen of Kappa Nu establish their new sorority after being informed by the president of Phi Lambda (a cameo-ing Selena Gomez) that traditional sororities cant throw parties - the fraternities handle that. But one tour of a frat bash - the ogling drunk dudes the ""No Means Yes"" signs - and Shelby and her friends want out.Finding a house the girls can afford proves a major challenge but then the ripped narcisssist nemesis of Neighbors Teddy Sanders (Zac Efron whos hysterical) offers to ""mentor"" the young women. He helps them figure out how to raise enough money to pay the rent and soon enough the screaming swarm are throwing down.Theres a feminist icon party (Hillary Oprah Joan of Arc) theres a troop of sisters dressed as Minions theres music through the night. And weed. Lots of weed.And across the way poor Mac and Kelly Radner (Seth Rogen Rose Byrne) toss and turn unable to sleep. The couple with their toddler Stella were on the brink of moving - they have an agreement of sale but when the prospective owners come over and catch the chaos and cacophony next door the deal is sure to fall apart.Directed like the first by Nicholas Stoller Neighbors 2 is rooted in the sweet irony that a guy played by Rogen - the shaggy doofus of a decades worth of smart/dumb stoner comedies - is now one of the ""the old people"" as Shelby puts it.Lets face it Mac and Kelly are grownups with a child to worry about with bills to pay - and even if they dont really understand what escrow is and have to toss their bongs out the window when the real estate agent shows up the responsibilities of adult life are real.And the irresponsible teenagers next door - something has to be done to get rid of them.So begins an epic battle involving everything from bed bugs to hacking iaPhones to a desperate drug heist and acts of crazy vengeance. Alliances falter alternative uses for feminine hygiene products are introduced - things get ugly.But beneath the screwball hijinks more serious probing into the nature of modern male and female relationships male and female expectations about friendship and wedship (and gay marriage) about parenting is pursued.And Rogen and Efrons characters find a novel new use for automobile airbags too.

Mac and Kelly are OK with their young daughter playing with a pink dildo dressed as a princess. They think a move to the burbs will bring normalcy. But the house theyre selling is under a 30-day escrow. First of all neither Mac nor Kelly know what escrow means. It means the new owners have a month to change their minds about buying the house. And duh how is that not going to happen when the sorority moves in next door. The movie earns points for giving credit to the sorority sisters led Shelby (Chloe Grace Moretz) and her BFFs -- Beth (Kiersey Clemons) and Nora (Beanie Feldstein). The girls are fed up with the ""super-rapey frats"" and having to learn the skill of ""eating out a guys ass."" They want to overturn the rule that says frats can throw parties but sororities cant. Its war. Rogen and his crew arent delivering anything fresh but in this case familiarity doesnt breed  contempt just more laughs. Efron gets his share especially when he and Rogen go shirtless at a tailgate party. Teddy is lost in this post-college world -- his career is going nowhere his bestie (Dave Franco) has married a dude and even the sorority girls who think Teddys a hottie dump him. ""Youre not like us dude "" says one. ""Youre an old person."" Ouch. Credit Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising for leaning in closer to the characters and letting feelings show through the farce.

Privacy Policy or Movie review Neighbors 2 flips the script to great success Katie Walsh Tribune News Service on May 18 2016 Published in Entertainment News Subscribe Subscribe Your email is safe with us. Privacy Policy or Two years ago ""Neighbors"" writers Andrew Jay Cohen and Brendan OBrien along with director Nicholas Stoller reinvented the classic college party movie by pitting the frat guys against the young parents next door. It was a raunchy but sweet rumination on getting older and growing out of party mode a refreshing take on the college movie formula. With ""Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising"" theyve flipped the script creating a feminist party classic thats completely current and doesnt skimp on any of the wild humor. Its also even better than its predecessor.Starring Chloe Grace Moretz Kiersey Clemons and Beanie Feldstein as the freshman founding members of Kappa Nu the film takes on a real world issue thats a legitimate problem on college campuses. Greek sorority houses arent allowed to host parties with alcohol so the majority of college parties take place in the ""boys rule"" atmosphere of fraternities often predatory environments with themes that are usually sexist and designed to get girls into skimpy outfits.The picture-perfect sororities of flower crowns and sundresses also arent the right fit for Shelby (Moretz) Beth (Clemons) and Nora (Feldstein). This is a trio of girls who want to party on their own turf and by their own rules. So they find their own house formerly the Delta Psi house next door to 30-something parents Mac (Seth Rogen) and Kelly (Rose Bryne).The couple are currently attempting to sell the property and just need to get through 30 days of escrow before the new buyers (Abbi Jacobson and Sam Richardson stealing the show) move in and have to deal with the Greeks. How do they confront the wild new sorority next door? A prank war of course. If it worked against Zac Efron and the Delta Psis how bad can some teenage girls be?Take ""Animal House"" or ""Revenge of the Nerds"" and turn the gender roles inside out and youll have ""Neighbors 2."" In fact eliminate almost all of the guys. The girls have no real interest in these slovenly dudes. Efron as Teddy the former frat guy who cant let go of his college lifestyle is simply there to be objectified a role he embraces by performing a ""Magic Mike"" style dance number while oiled up in barbecue grease. They refer to him as ""Hot Guy.""The film derives a lot of humor from embracing and also complicating stereotypes. These girls are at once absorbed in their phones but also physically powerful. They wage war through texting and always refer to their neighbors as ""the old people."" Those ""old people"" Kelly and Mac question their own parenting skills but theyve embraced the role of parenthood vowing to do what parents do best stop young people from having fun. Their realization that their toddler daughter will one day grow up to be a petulant teen leads to a touching moment that gets at the bittersweet nature of parenthood.Isnt it time that the ladies got their own rollicking foul-mouthed THC-soaked party movie? The fact that it contains a profoundly progressive message about the difficulties of bucking an inherently sexist system helps its instant-classic status. With high school graduation season upon us ""Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising"" should be required viewing for anyone matriculating into college next year. Congrats grads Good luck have fun and remember -- never drink the punch.NEIGHBORS 2 SORORITY RISING4 out of 4 starsCast Seth Rogen Zac Efron Rose Byrne Chloe Grace Moretz Kiersey Clemons Beanie FeldsteinDirected by Nicholas StollerRunning time 1 hour 32 minutesRated R for crude sexual content including brief graphic nudity language throughout drug use and teen partying.(c)2016 Tribune Content Agency LLCDistributed by Tribune Content Agency LLC.

Its a sight to behold -- again and again and again -- but a calculated effort like most of this film to appeal to the ladies. As surprising as it seems for an R-rated comedy made by many men it totally succeeds on that front and many others.When they endure a harrowing five minutes inside the carnival of macabre sexist pleasures that is a frat party college friends Shelby (Chloe Grace Moretz) and her new pals Beth (Kiersey Clemons) and Nora (Beanie Feldstein) take off to smoke weed in their dorm room and hatch a plan to start their own sorority Kappa Nu. Meanwhile the inept/typical parents/adults from Neighbors Kelly (Rose Byrne) and Mac (Seth Rogen) think theyre in the clear The frat next door along with Teddy (Efron) and his brothers is long gone and Kelly and Mac have bought a new house anyway and sold the old one. Unfortunately they dont know what ""escrow"" means and discover that they have to keep up appearances on their old house for thirty days just when Shelby and the gangs makeshift sorority opens up next door with one objective to party on their own terms.Film DetailsCritics Pick Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising RatingR GenreComedy Running Time92 min. More Info Trailer And party they do but not exactly in the ways you might expect after seeing the Spring Breakers-like trailers. A hilarious montage showcases the sorority sisters a cappella karaoke soirees Fault in Our Stars cryfests and a laugh-out-loud-funny ""Feminist Hero"" costume party where the power of Oprah is invoked and three people (including Efrons Teddy) dress as Hillary Clinton. Teddy has joined ranks with the sisters after his bro Pete (Dave Franco) gets engaged to his boyfriend and kicks Teddy out. Thats right Pete is gay and for once in a studio comedy queerness is incidental rather than a joke. Like real life.Shelbys crew proves wickedly endearing. Feldsteins performance as the adrenaline-powered ball of sunshine and pain pills invites comparisons to Aidy Bryant or a less complainy Jonah Hill who as it turns out is her real-life older brother. The girls get a stab at physical comedy too. Pledges dressed as Minions hanging from chandeliers and falling down stairs in the background account for the extra-long roster of female stunt actors in the credits and a frenetic action sequence thats more beautifully shot than comedies demand has Shelby chasing Mac through a hard-partying sea of tailgaters to retrieve a garbage bag of weed so she can sell it and make rent.With so many women in the cast the doors open for new avenues of gross-out humor. A mid-coitus barf from Kelly is followed by a recurring vibrator gag where Kelly and Macs daughter now age two keeps finding Mommys bright-pink dildo prompting the couple to just dress it up like a pretty princess and call it good. Byrne as always is on point but the best of these scenes by far is a sorority-sister bloody-tampon carpet bomb that delivers in laughs before delivering in lessons -- Teddy tells them bloody tampons are ""gross"" but the women convince him that theyre actually funny-gross. EXPAND Courtesy of Universal Pictures Teddy of course learns a lot of lessons in his time at Kappa Nu the most salient being that frat parties themes always make girls play hos. When he finally grasps this his face contorts into the pained acknowledgment that he may have been a terrible person and thus begins Teddys journey to maturity -- and later the realization that hes an ""old"" with no friends and no direction. Its almost impossible that a human could have Efrons abs and his comic timing and director Nicholas Stoller definitely makes use of both even working in a Magic Mike-worthy dance scene.As a writer and director Stoller (Forgetting Sarah Marshall The Five-Year Engagement) has long been a proponent of funny women and people of color. This films no different. Girl Codes Awkwafina plays a potato-chip-munching monotone stoner Veeps new breakout star Sam Richardson gives his stilted goody-goody best and Jerrod Carmichael reprises his role as Garf whos now joined Hannibal Buresss cop character on the local police force. Carmichael and Buress get one of the funniest scenes in a funny movie when they bust a bunch of white drug dealers drawing some comic inspiration from Denzel Washington in Training Day. They wreak havoc playing tough until they burst into a room of African-American weed entrepreneurs -- whom they proceed to treat with the utmost respect. Its a timely role reversal playing on the cordial way in which white mass-shooter Dylann Roof was treated by white cops. Stoller doesnt shy away from jokes with some edge even in a mostly innocuous comedy.Theres so much good to say about Neighbors 2 that its easy to overlook some flat punchlines like the lackluster ending to a drawn-out text-messaging prank. Even then Kelly and Macs relationship is hashtag marriagegoals. Meanwhile the complexity of feminism for young girls today is displayed with rare hilarity and insight. Nobody captures the spirit of it all better though than Shelbys father played by an always alarmingly perfect Kelsey Grammer ""So what you get to be just as dumb as the boys are now?"" Yes.

Rogen and Byrne face more noisy neighbors and unexpected enlightenment in this sequel. Director Nicholas Stoller.(Running Time 132) R Rude sexual content including brief graphic nudity language throughout drug use and teen partying. Area theaters. The gender may have changed but the stakes and laughs remain high in ""Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising."" The sequel to the 2014 R-rated comedy once again pits grown-ups against the noisy kids next door but its much more than a rehash of the same premise. Two years after the original ""Neighbors"" Mac and Kelly Radner (Seth Rogen Rose Byrne) have finally found a buyer for their house but this time a new sorority created by Chloe Moretzs Shelby and her friends are causing them just as much grief. The sorority is set up with the sole purpose to give the sisters the chance to party like their frat brothers do but loud bashes will likely scare away the couples buyer. Sisters Act (From l.) Carla Gallo Rose Byrne Seth Rogen Ike Barinholtz and Zac Efron observe the enemy in Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising. (Photo Credit Chuck Zlotnick) Meanwhile the Radners old frathouse rival Teddy Sanders (Zac Efron) feels like hes not living up to his potential so he offers his consulting services to Shelby so her sorority can make the money necessary to pay rent. Meet the women behind Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising ""Neighbors 2"" offers quite a few new tricks from the original comedy if only because it forces the Radners to face the fact that someday their adorable 2-year-old daughter might grow up to be one of those partying hellions keeping them up all night. At first they think that dealing with a sorority has to be handled slightly more tenderly than the rowdy fratboys from the first movie but they quickly learn that college girls have the potential to be even more formidable than their male counterparts. The Abs and the Abs-Nots Efron and Rogen have a lot to learn on campus in the sequel to 2014s Neighbors. (Photo Credit Universal Pictures) Most of the characters from the original ""Neighbors"" return some in larger roles than others but once again director Nicholas Stoller finds a way to create resonance with the audience whether its parents trying to raise young daughters or teen girls rooting for Selby and friends. Hes quite good at creating comedy that is gender-neutral making ""Neighbors 2"" perfectly fine as a date movie for couples. But ""Neighbors 2"" isnt just a battle of the sexes. Kelly -- pregnant with the couples second daughter -- doesnt want to squash Shelbys female empowerment so it becomes more about how the unimpressionable texting teens view their elders. Even Teddy is eventually thrown to the curb for being too old and boring which is when he switches sides and agrees to help Kelly and Mac with their problem. Chloe Moretz to star in The Little Mermaid The ladies of Kappa Nu are led by Chloe Grace Moretzs Shelby (c.) (Photo Credit Chuck Zlotnick) Any attempt at deeper themes aside ""Neighbors 2"" is hilariously funny as it continues to keep the jokes moving at a fast pace paying homage to some of the gags from the earlier movie but always giving them a different spin. Rogens well-established routine is clearly maturing with age helped by the likes of Byrne who continues to prove her worth as a comic actress. Efrons also quite funny -- and when all else fails he can remove his shirt. With the added layer of humor that comes with switching genders ""Neighbors 2"" ends up offering even more laughs than the original movie.

The movie also made more than 270 million globally so it seemed almost inevitable that there would be a sequel. Just two years later Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising has arrived and if the first film was a frat boy with bigger aspirations its hastily conceived follow-up is the dude--or as the title implies approximately 30 gonzo girls--who really just came to party. Mac (Seth Rogen) and Kelly Radner (Rose Byrne) return as the thirtyish pair raising their now toddler daughter and expecting a second; theyve already bought a new house in the suburbs for their expanding family and found a nice couple (Veeps Sam Richardson and Broad Citys Abbi Jacobson) to move into the old one when their Realtor delivers the bad-news asterisk a dirty word called escrow. It means the buyers have 30 days to back out of the sale for any reason--like say a sudden influx of spliff-rolling Snapchatting teenage sociopaths on their peaceful block. Mac and Kelly arent expecting trouble having already waged and won their War of the Broses with nightmares-next-door Delta Psi Beta the last time around. But there can be no sequel without conflict and apparently no comedy without Zac Efrons lightly furred nipples. Enter Teddy Sanders Neighbors chief architect of air-bag pranks and general mayhem returning here as a sort of freelance mentor/hot house-dad for the just-formed sorority Kappa Nu. Efrons character has graduated from college since we last saw him but just barely and hes more than a little adrift in his job at Abercrombie amp; Fitch. (Employees are no longer allowed to work topless and hes realized he might be the oldest guy there ""I had to cover for my boss Mason because he had to go to his prom"" he says mournfully.) So he jumps at the chance to help Shelby (Chloe Grace Moretz) and her ""sisters"" kick-start Kappa a house that defies the Greek systems rules by letting its members wild out as freely as the boys do. Were supposed to take this as some form of millennial feminism but mostly it just seems like a chance to be as equal-opportunity awful as the guys who came before. The girls never develop cohesive personalities and the slapstick-heavy script--credited tellingly to five different writers--quickly tosses out any semblance of pacing pinballing from one raunchy punchline to the next. (The goofy sweetness of Rogen and Byrnes interplay has also been sidelined and the visual gags are a lot gaggier in both senses of the word.) Youll probably laugh hard more than once; Sorority Rising is still rich in bikinis and bong rips and boner jokes. It just doesnt have much heart.

Nine years ago Seth Rogen was a schlubby stoner with a terrible idea for a porn site and absolutely no clue how to raise the baby that resulted from a miscommunication during his one-night stand with Katherine Heigl. Now in the wake of ""Neighbors"" ""The Night Before"" and Nicholas Stollers hilarious and genuinely progressive ""Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising"" the 34-year-old actor is somehow poised to become Americas next iconic movie dad. On one hand... how the fuck did that happen? On the other hand isnt this the logical conclusion for a guy who became famous as the chortling face of the man-child movement a guy who made his career by inviting viewers to watch him repeatedly negotiate between the comforts of arrested development and the abject horrors of adulthood? Rogens brand is transition. Seen collectively his movies are nothing less than a template for how to grow up without completely giving in. Liberal funny and constantly guffawing at the absurdity of bringing a kid into this world when he still feels like a kid himself Rogen isnt just a dad; hes the dad that a generation of flawed well-meaning white men can see themselves becoming (full disclosure Me). And ""Neighbors 2"" might just be his masterpiece. READ MORE 2016 Summer Movie Preview 16 Blockbusters You Cant Miss This Season One of the greatest comedy sequels ever made ""Sorority Rising"" lovingly circles back to the characters that were established in the 2014 original and finds that all of them -- whether by choice or by sheer inertia -- have moved just a notch further along the circle of life. The action picks up a few years after the first film as Mac (Rogen) and his wife Kelly (the indomitable Rose Byrne) are preparing to sell the most unfortunately located house in all of suburban Georgia. Their daughter Stella (once again played by Zoey Vargas a nice touch that actually makes a difference is now a toddler and she has a baby sister on the way. When a cool young couple agrees to take Mac and Kellys property off their hands the new buyers are given 30 days to inspect the house and make sure that everything is up to snuff. Bad news for our hapless heroes They bought their new place outright so if this deal falls apart theyll be stuck with two homes. Worse news for our hapless heroes The animal house next door vacant since Zac Efron and his frat bros partied it into pieces is about to get some very loud new tenants. And get this Theyre girls (cue record scratch). And not just any girls but freshmen -- or freshpeople -- who have an agenda that goes deeper than just getting drunk. Beth (""Dope"" star Kiersey Clemons) Nora (Beanie Feldstein) and eventual ringleader Shelby (Chloe Grace Moretz) tried rushing one of their schools well-established sororities but were shocked to learn that fraternities are the only half of the Greek system who are allowed to throw parties. And when fraternities throw parties the girls are debased the drinks are spiked and the sex isnt reliably consensual. So Beth Nora and Shelby decide to start their own sorority. At Kappa Nu girls dont have to dress for the male gaze. At Kappa Nu sisterhood doesnt require a sacrifice of self-respect. At Kappa Nu partying isnt a display of hedonism its a show of defiance. These young women are pledging with a purpose and its a purpose that Mac and Kelly naturally want to support. But when Mac asks his new neighbors to keep quiet during the escrow period he becomes just another man telling them to smile. Cue mutually assured destruction. Alas Kappa Nu isnt a worthy opponent -- not because theyre women but rather because theyre 18-year-olds who only moved out of their childhood bedrooms last week. Fortunately for them they have a secret weapon. When last we saw Teddy (Efron) he was fulfilling his destiny as one of those shirtless models outside of an Abercrombie amp; Fitch. But times have changed a lot more than he has and the former god of all Greek life -- while still so frighteningly ripped that his skin seems ready to split open and vomit muscles -- now finds himself stuck in neutral as the rest of his friends are transitioning into their adult lives. The film begins by hammering that point home as his roommate and lifelong best man (Dave Franco) gets engaged to his boyfriend and Teddy is forced to find a new place to live (Francos character has come out in between movies and ""Neighbors 2"" has nothing but love for his new direction). Fleeing to his old frat house for comfort Teddy soon finds himself teaming up with its new residents in their war against Mac and Kelly retreating back to his old ways in a desperate attempt to deny the fact that he should have outgrown them. Comedy ensues. So much comedy. There are far too many laughs in ""Sorority Rising"" to enumerate everything that works about this sequel and its telling that the few botched gags stick out like sore thumbs -- one overextended joke involving a marital miscommunication and some bad green screen inadvertently serves as a reminder that the rest of the movie is too funny to take for granted. The visual gags are as strong (and occasionally disgusting) as they were in the first film and a brilliant mid-movie marijuana heist feels like it could have been directed by Michael Mann. READ MORE Seth Rogen Regrets That Some Superbad Jokes Were Blatantly Homophobic But what really makes the humor sing is that -- like all great comedy -- its rooted in truth. No matter how ridiculous this movie gets theres a sensitive and unshakeable humanity at its core. Theres no villain here only conflicting interests. Theres no college dean who gets dunked in a pool of vomit only Lisa Kudrow showing up for one shining moment so Byrne can yell at her. There are no cops who exist just to bust up a party at a dramatically convenient moment theres just Hannibal Buress and Jerrod Carmichael as two black officers whose one (very topical) scene is the stuff of instant legend. Most crucially Mac and Kelly want to support the sorority. Theyre raising a daughter and its important to them as good liberals and decent human beings that young women are not systematically marginalized by male power structures. Ideally theyd love to get a good nights sleep without propping up the patriarchy but sometimes thats not possible. The classic Apatow-era tropes of arrested development are given new life by dropping Teddy into the middle of a tug-of-war between the past and the future and the film is unusually insightful as to how generation gaps have simultaneously shrunk and gotten harsher. In ""Neighbors"" Teddy was a symbol of perfect youth. In ""Sorority Rising"" hes lost in the limbo between adolescence and adulthood; one scene finds him sitting in a room full of girls oblivious to the fact that everyone there is silently mocking him via text. Efron for his part is once again an absolute genius in this role perfectly balancing the sweetness of a good dude with the stupidity of a regular dude. His performance epitomizes the empathy that Stoller has for all of his characters and its at the heart of why this movie feels so warm and re-watchable. Considering the themes that help shape this film its a shame that these sorority sisters arent as well-defined as the frat bros were in the first one. Moretz Clemons and Feldstein all display the comic chops required to sell this material but the movie is too tight to let them run with it. ""Neighbors"" relied on its supporting cast in almost every scene while this sequel too often feels like its working around them. At a curt 90 minutes ""Sorority Rising"" could have benefited from a little breathing room especially because some of its trailers biggest moments (e.g. L.L. Cool J as Beths dad) didnt make the final cut. But Stoller finishes strong his wonderful sequel leaving America in a pretty good place. Weed is practically legal girls are people too and Seth Rogen is the new Tom Hanks. Get used to it. Grade A- ""Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising"" opens in theaters on Friday.

Thankfully director Nicholas Stoller and stars Seth Rogen Rose Byrne and Zac Efron are all back for another go-round so whatever might be lacking in inspiration is made up for by a steady stream of well-earned laughs. The press notes proudly mention that the original ""Neighbors"" was 2014s highest-grossing original comedy but even if no one packed the originality this time around at least they brought the comedy. See Video Zac Efron and Seth Rogen Face New Enemy in First Neighbors 2 Trailer Having successfully battled the loud frat boys next door in the previous installment Mac (Rogen) and Kelly (Byrne) are ready to move on to a bigger home since Kelly is expecting their second child. (We learn this when she has morning sickness all over Macs face and the credits have barely finished rolling.) Meanwhile Teddy (Efron) is in a post-collegiate rut with his bros all building careers or getting married; his roommate and bestie Pete (Dave Franco) in fact has made several discoveries about himself since graduation and hes about to tie the knot with his boyfriend which means Teddy has to find a new place to live. Back at school freshman girls Shelby (Chloe Grace Moretz) Beth (Kiersey Clemons ""Dope"") and Nora (Beanie Feldstein ""Fan Girl"") learn that sororities arent allowed to throw parties but fraternities are -- and since they quickly discover how ""rapey"" those shindigs are they pool their money to rent the house next to Mac and Kelly to start their own off-campus sorority where their teen-girl hedonism can run wild. See Video Watch Seth Rogen Zac Efron Draw Penises on Conan OBriens Face Their timing couldnt be worse since Mac and Kelly are under a 30-day escrow and if the new owners figure out that theres a house of unsupervised partiers next door the deals off. Teddy starts out as a mentor to the sorority showing them how to make enough money to pay off their shady real estate agent (played by Billy Eichner) but when they decide Teddys too old and out-of-it to keep around he teams up with Mac and Kelly to drive out another bunch of wild and crazy Greeks. ""Neighbors 2"" maintains the same sort of raucous and outrageous humor that made the first one so much fun illustrating the difference between pot-smoking 30-ish parents and out-of-control wild children and the jokes and set pieces here land as well as they did before. (Not that anyone goes to these movies for the special effects granted but its worth noting that theres a green-screen shot of Rogen in this movie thats one of the very worst ever presented in a major motion picture.) If the film falls short its in its skittishness in dealing with the sexuality of the sorority girls. One of the best features of both movies is the fact that Byrnes character is never presented as a scoldy-mommy killjoy. In this film she has to lay off the stimulants because of her pregnancy but her personality is no smaller or meeker than her husbands. (Both of them insist to their Realtor that they understand escrow when of course neither actually does.) Also Read Katherine Heigl Shares Awkward Seth Rogen Encounter After Knocked Up Swipe But while these freshwomen go nuts with drinking and smoking pot none of them seem to get laid much; we see a sign for a party marking Shelbys loss of her virginity but the man or woman or multiples thereof responsible are discreetly never shown or discussed. And after all when Efron and his frat buddies lived in that house it was non-stop licentiousness and dildo molding. (Theres a funny moment in the sequel when the sisters school Efron on male privilege by making him realize that the theme of every party his frat threw ended with ""...and Hos."") Theres all of one scene where the young ladies ogle and objectify Teddy -- hes wearing short-shorts and covered in hot grease so how could they not? -- but were meant to believe that Zac Efron can live in a house with more than a dozen teenage girls without ever having to fend off a single advance. Its a weirdly Puritanical blip on a movie that otherwise has no qualms about any and all bodily functions. Still ""Neighbors 2"" never lags and the laughs keep coming even though theyre coming from a fairly familiar place. If thats all you want thats what you get. But hey at least you get it which is more than you can say for most sequels.

Daily Edition Login to download Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising Film Review 330 AM PDT 5/4/2016 by John DeFore FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS A somewhat funny but ill-conceived retread. TWITTER 5/20/2016 Chloe Grace Moretz wants to make life hell for Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne in the Neighbors sequel which also brings back Zac Efron. Heaven help the next generation of American women if Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising represents what Hollywood thinks of them. In Nicholas Stollers sequel to his 2014 Neighbors even the with-it girls -- the ones too freethinking to join a cookie-cutter sorority -- are so dumb they make the bros in the first movie look like elder statesmen. Smarts arent the point of course -- the reason these freshmen strike out on their own renting a house next to Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne is that they hunger for their very own place to get stoned. But in their awkward attempt to shoehorn these kids into the first pics formula Stoller and his writing collaborators care far less about creating believable characters than getting to the next laugh. Those yuks are plentiful enough to ensure a reasonable box-office return. But viewers prone to worries about Hollywoods treatment of women -- a fair chunk of whom are young students this film wants to attract -- may be laughing less loudly than those around them. In an uncharacteristically flat performance Chloe Grace Moretz plays Shelby who doesnt fit the Barbie mold at the sorority shes rushing Phi Lambda. She sticks with rush even after learning that sororities cant host their own parties and must go to frat houses to get wasted. But at her first such party the rapey vibe is so intense (is a ""No Means Yes"" banner perhaps too subtle a clue?) she and new friends Beth (Kiersey Clemons) and Nora (Beanie Feldstein) decide to start their own club. The search for a party house to call their own leads them to the vacant home next door to Mac and Kelly Radner (Rogen amp; Byrne) who successfully ran Zac Efron amp; co. out in the last picture. But how will three girls pay the 5000 rent? Enter an unlikely mentor Efrons Teddy Sanders whose bros have done an astonishing amount of growing up in the two years since we saw them (and in the case of Dave Francos Pete come out of the closet) leaving him the only one without a real career. In one quick scene the girls go from telling Teddy hes sexist to admitting theyre clueless about every real-world suggestion he is making to enlisting him as the man who will show them how to get money from other girls to rent the house. Rarely if ever in this script is an accusation of sexism not either made to look dumb or used as a joke. Mac (Rogen) and Kelly (Byrne) getting set to have a second child have just managed to sell this house and buy a bigger one in the suburbs. But this one is in escrow with the new owners having 30 days to make random inspections and back out for any reason. Reasons like say a yard full of beer cans next door. Teddy looking to get even with his old neighbors (lets forget they actually patched things up after the last movies parents-vs-fratboys warfare) sets out to host parties so outlandish no prospective homebuyer could ignore them. But as they come into their own as party animals the girls give Teddy the heave-ho saying the most hurtful thing a low-IQ stud like this could hear ""Youre not like us dude youre an old person."" Teddy rebounds by joining Mac and Kelly in their attempt to shut the sorority down. The ensuing back-and-forth assault is often funny but doesnt work nearly as well as the first films action. A set piece involving a massive weed heist at a tailgate party provides weird madcap action and yes it offers the frequently shirtless Efron the opportunity to strip-tease for panting college girls. But another involving iPhone sabotage (texting being one of the few things Shelbys crew is good at evidently) is incoherent depending on nonsensical responses from the adult victims. The movies neo-sorority villains are not the only brain-deprived characters onscreen -- Teddy doesnt understand boiling water; Kellys best friend is 8.97 months pregnant and doesnt know how labor works. But especially in a sequel that deprives its adult female lead of the comic opportunities she did so well with in the first film their depiction here feels like a provocation to any woman or man in the crowd who yearns for more sentient female characters in pop culture. But this is only a movie right? Its not like it has any effect on how real men and women view each other in the world. Tell that to the Womens Studies professors these students will meet if they ever put down the bong long enough to take school seriously.

Considering its another trouble-in-suburbia comedy of modest proportions boasting no innovations in form or technique it may seem odd to say that ""Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising"" couldnt -- or at least wouldnt -- have been made a mere decade ago. Yet a distinctly current engagement with identity politics colors and complicates Nicholas Stollers rampantly rude rowdy sequel to 2014s squares-vs.-students farce With sly sorority girls having replaced lunkheaded fratboys as the collective nemesis of Seth Rogen and Rose Byrnes harried hip-no-more homeowners the film has a knowingly conflicted engagement with millennial-generation feminism that freshens its outlook even as it unevenly rejigs many of its predecessors gags. Still while a subtly clawed Chloe Grace Moretz proves a worthy new foil its Zac Efrons tragicomic anatomy of a dudebro that remains this series sharpest asset. Though its ribald antics (not to mention Efrons copious and formidable shirtlessness) drew a sizable younger demographic the original ""Neighbors"" was fundamentally a film steeped in thirtysomething ennui Its warmest wiliest comedy captured the deflating self-recognition of those comfortably too young for middle age yet emphatically too old to be down with the kids. That sneaky sense of generational limbo also sits at the heart of this slightly less-cuddly sequel though its hapless victim has changed. While middle-class marrieds Mac (Rogen) and Kelly (Byrne) have settled contentedly into early parenthood former college fraternity leader Teddy (Efron) is struggling to find his place in the world -- even his low-ambition retail job at Abercrombie amp; Fitch has turned on him demanding that the still-ripped underachiever now wear a shirt to work. What else can Teddy offer the world if not his abs? More mortifyingly still Teddys former Delta Psi brothers all appear to have grown up faster than he has. With his best friend and roommate Pete (Dave Franco) newly engaged to be married -- to another ex-fratboy in a socially progressive twist the film happily handles in wholly snicker-free fashion -- Teddy finds himself lacking not just a raison detre but a roof over his head. Unlikely sanctuary emerges at the very site of his glory days now home to Kappa Nu a fledgling ""house of united women"" founded by snarky weed-smoking outlier Shelby (Moretz) as an alternative to the no-drugs/no-gluten/no-fun doctrine enforced by a cameoing Selena Gomezs prissy sorority leader. Outraged by the sexist double standards of typical college-dorm culture Shelby enlists Teddys hedonistic expertise to help prove that sorority girls can party just as hard as fratboys and on their own terms. Kappa Nus feminist rebellion may hew closer to the ""Spring Breakers"" playbook than to the suffragette one though the women do succeed in making Teddy reassess the ""bros before hoes"" code. (The term ""hoes"" he repeats as if imparting revelatory wisdom is ""not cool."") Notionally empowering as Kappu Nus remix of Cyndi Laupers ""girls just wanna have fun"" directive may be its very bad news indeed for on-the-move neighbors Mac and Kelly whose plans to swiftly sell their house are scuppered by the raucous activity next door. The setup may be different from the first film then but the upshot is the same as much of the running time is given over to a prankish war of wills between young adults and their elders -- who find that smart sorority girls make far feistier enemies than jocks of Teddys ilk. The films cheerfully scattershot script (by returning ""Neighbors"" scribes Andrew Jay Cohen and Brendan OBrien with added input this time from Rogen Stoller and Evan Goldberg) is most interesting in the ambivalence of its sympathies. Shelbys sisterhood validly calls out mainstream societys sanitized female ideals yet also exploits social justice to coldly antisocial effect; Mac and Kelly meanwhile have their share of liberal blind spots exposed in a handful of blunt deliberately grimace-inducing gags that skate the boundaries of racism and anti-Semitism. Some viewers will chuckle sheepishly as Orthodox Jews are blithely burlesqued while others may take a stonier stance. In a film that finds its own characters debating the limits and applications of political correctness -- ""Theres no such thing as reverse sexism Mr. White Man"" a woman tells Mac -- a degree of contentiousness seems intended. That no one has an entirely solid leg to stand on in this particular dispute is what keeps the narrative salty even as it wobbles in the midsection with a couple of strained high-farce set pieces. A labored series of text-message miscommunications builds to a rather muted punchline while a frenetically paced marijuana heist (extending Rogens ongoing commitment to pro-cannabis comedy) is more breathless than hilarious -- notwithstanding the sight of Rogens quivering belly painted with the Sharpie-thick stomach muscles of a Ninja Turtle. ""Neighbors 2"" is often funniest in its incidental observations of social embarrassment and ineptitude The delightful Rose Byrne now an established secret weapon in studio comedy scores the films purest laugh with a botched bribery of college dean Lisa Kudrow (granted just one scene -- always a dozen too few where Kudrow is concerned) more exquisitely excruciating than most of its more elaborate gross-out gambits. (Not that an introductory scene of mid-coital morning sickness will be easily wiped from the brain.) Despite its high-concept absurdity ""Neighbors 2"" remains a character comedy at heart scrutinizing its characters pile-up of errors with empathy if not total forgiveness. So its a neat trick that its most vacant figure has somehow become its most touching Efron a gifted comic performer who has learned to wield his unblemished physical beauty as a kind of punchline plays dumb with deadpan elegance (""Theres no I in sorority"" he enthuses with perfect conviction) but also a hint of echoing desperation. Perhaps after all its provocative muddling of identity politics this messy but lively sequel does come down on the side of the handsome straight white male -- but if so its a pity vote at best.

Its such a surprise very very well written and acted. Every actor is a winner and Efron is the VIP. This film also goes deeper than the first one while sisterhood/brotherhood sexism and parenthood are all touched though not that serious its very effective. Love it. Reply stevenkovacs says May 5 2016 at 339 am Great cast; I look forward to seeing it Reply Kimber says May 5 2016 at 316 am We get it you like big words. Like another commenter said it feels like you just grabbed a thesaurus and started typing. Its not enjoyable to read in the slightest. Besides that appreciate the review. Reply Michael Sitz says May 4 2016 at 843 am Great tribute to Zac and thumbs up for an honest review giving credit where it is due. My apology for a little criticism but too many times you guys seem to write with an open thesaurus where the survival of mankind rests on every single statement producing a (pseudo) intellectual slam dunk... For once screw loose some of your logic center plates and write a review that even HAL could appreciate reading without an almost caboose track bumpity bump bumipty bump....we will still respect you in the morning.... -) Reply Rob says June 17 2016 at 1201 pm If you were a little bit more well- read you would realize that this is written by a movie reviewer. It is his job to write. Therefore he knows all of these big words because he is a good writer. That is what good writers do they write well. I would rather read a review where people like yourself have to go pick up said thesaurus to understand it than read a review that makes sense to anyone over the age of five.
