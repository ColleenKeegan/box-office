As Mia teeters on the brink of death her spirit (which remains nicely dressed) watches events at the hospital and reflects on the times preceding the crash--in particular on the love that bloomed between her and a brooding rocker named Adam (Jamie Blackley). R. J. Cutlers film adapted by Shauna Cross from the young-adult novel by Gayle Forman is decorous to behold and unerringly doomy in tone as its target audience demands. Its also in no hurry whatever; the title refers to Mias fraught decision--should she cling to existence or just give up?--and well before the end even loyal viewers will be begging her to hurry up and choose.

Guess which one finds box-office gold? Based on Gayle Formans 2009 YA bestseller If I Stay has the virtue of starring Chloe Grace Moretz (Kick-Ass Let Me In Hugo) 17 a skilled actress who can make me believe anything. But not this Chloe not this. Moretz plays Mia Hall an Oregon high schooler with a gift for cello a rocker boyfriend (Jamie Blackley) indulgent parents (Mireille Enos and Joshua Leonard) and an itch to get into Julliard. While audience members who havent nodded off hold their breath over the outcome theres a car accident. There had to be something. A comatose Mia is rushed into surgery. But her spirit wanders around eavesdroping on family and friends who cant see her. Mia shy and uncertain in life needs to be convinced theres a reason to live if she stays. As I write these words I feel myself experiencing a loss of consciousness wondering how this recipe for sugar shock could interest any sentient being over the age of nine. Documentarian R.J. Cutler (The September Issue) in his feature debut joins Moretz in delivering this pap as if it meant something. Cue eye rolling.

But it really is for Portland teenager Mia (Chloe Moretz Hit Girl in Kick-Ass) in this adaptation of Gayle Formans bestselling young-adult novel. We find the budding classical cellist as her relationship with rocker Adam (Jamie Blackley) hangs in the balance. Not only are their musical pathways diverging but when a family car crash leaves Mia in a coma her very future is uncertain. Flashbacks to their romance are surprisingly engrossing leaving the rest of the movie struggling to wring even more feeling from Mias out-of-body POV. Our stricken heroine witnesses the post-smash reactions of friends and loved ones before finally deciding whether she wants to live or not. For a drama pretty much aimed at 12-year-old girls this is less superficial than youd expect. Veteran doc-maker RJ Cutler approaches teenage growing pains and looming independence with due seriousness. Adding the life-or-death device almost seems a bit much (especially with a celestial glow hanging over everything) highlighting the acting limitations of Moretz and Blackley as they try to move up through the emotional gears. Caring grandpa Stacy Keach brings genuine feeling to a movie which while solidly done falls slightly short of full-on blubfest.

DOANE GREGORY BY MICHAEL SRAGOW / MOVIE CRITIC Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF If I StayStarring Chloe Grace Moretz Jamie Blackley Mireille Einos Directed by R.J. Cutler Rated PG-13 for thematic elements and some sexual material Running time 1 hour 46 minutes Playing In wide releaseThe quick hitA lachrymose depressing story about a comatose teenage girl who decides whether to live or die during an extended out-of-body experience. Grade D The heroine lies in the coma but the audience may feel brain-dead by the end of ""If I Stay"" a bludgeoning adaptation of Gayle Formans novel about a teenage girl who nearly dies on the road after a truck plows into the family car on a snowy Oregon day. As the movie cuts back and forth between her recollections of a happy home and the escalating body count in the hospital you wonder whether the actors come on too strong because they know their characters will soon die. Chloe Grace Moretz plays a budding classical cellist who delights her ex-Riot Girl mom (Mireille Enos) and former punk drummer dad (Joshua Leonard) by dating an up-and-coming rocker (Jamie Blackley). Following Formans lead screenwriter Shauna Cross and director R.J. Cutler make the love between a classical geek and a hipster idol as fraught as that of any mixed couple even though her parents actually approve. Still those in need of a cry might be able to accept the histrionics and forced humor - and forgive the over-acted under-felt getting-to-know-you scenes - if there werent a queasy aspect to the storytelling. As the unconscious girl puts it in the book ""If I stay. If I live. Its up to me."" She goes through an out-of-body experience (the film includes much walking toward the light) determining whether she wants to survive without family members who are dead or dying. Forman has written that the novel emerged from the real-life tale of a family cut down by a car crash. She was curious about a boy who clung to life longer than the rest - ""an act of tenacity followed by surrender."" Really? Is ""surrender"" the right word? Formans interpretation of the line between life and death puts a terrible weight on the living and the dead. Do she and the moviemakers soberly want to push the idea that a girl close to death can simply choose to snap out of her coma? How are friends and family supposed to take it if she gives herself a thumbs-down? (Stacy Keach is excellent as yup Gramps who tells her comatose self he accepts her decision either way; like a good Gramps he accepts everything.) If you must see the film ignore the dialogue. As divine cello music streams through the hospitals speaker system (thanks to her loyal boyfriend) pretend that the films real message is ""You gotta have art.""

But full disclosure seeing a brief online ad for If I Stay a couple of weeks ago asking if we were ""ready for all the feels"" might have put me in the wrong mind-set for the movie. Based on Gayle Formans best-selling novel If I Stay follows a young promising teenage cellist her whole life ahead of her who winds up comatose after a horrific car accident. While Mias (Chloe Grace Moretz) body lies lifeless on a bed a ghostly version of her haunts the corridors of the hospital listens in on her loved ones and reminisces about her life. On the surface it seems perfect for our ""feels""-obsessed culture -- in which feelings are commodified and presented to us as bite-size viral fixes instead of things that come organically from within. ""Come see a near-death teenager movie and get sad"" it seems to say the way an Upworthy headline might tell me what I need to feel about something before I even know what the hell it is. But heres the thing For much of its running time If I Stay isnt that movie. Until it is. And even then it sort of isnt. Allow me to explain.Unfolding (at least at first) with surprising patience and admirable restraint R.J. Cutlers film initially privileges character instead of melodrama. As Mia narrates her short life to us we see her loving interactions with her family her discovery of the cello her first meeting with her boyfriend Adam (Jamie Blackley). Hes a high-school rocker whose success is preordained (we already saw in the films framing device that his band will soon be opening for the Shins) and he loves her cello playing even though he knows nothing about classical music. She on the other hand admires his sense of purpose and confidence. (""He already knew who he was. Me not so much."")They make for an interesting contrast in emotional temperatures these two kids. Adam thrives on the anger and chaos of punk and rock - even though the music he plays is insufferably bland and anonymous - while Mia grooves on the order structure and solitude of the cello. Maybe its because Mias parents are also rockers Dad (Joshua Leonard) gave up his band Nasty Business to become a teacher after their second child while Mom (Mireille Enos) is a former riot grrrl turned travel agent. In Adam she sees someone who brings together her parents joie de vivre with her own romantic melancholy.Thats the good news. Throughout its first half If I Stay proceeds elegantly deliberately without trying to shamelessly jerk our tears. But within these moments also lie the seeds of the films downfall because theres also a curiously sterile quality to the films exchanges. Adam may be a high-school rocker but hes also always understanding never neglectful. What conflict the story does offer up -- Mia applies to Juilliard thus throwing their future into jeopardy since Adam wants to stay on the West Coast -- never feels like a real challenge to their relationship. Indeed Adams frustration proves how much he loves her. We also sense a similar kind of perfection in Mias parents. Theyre fun and funny and super chill about Mia dating cool rocker boys and hanging out all night with them; at one point as Mia says good night to Adam at her door the parents yell out from inside that she should stay out with him. Those are great parents to have sure but it starts to get insufferable after a while. Even her younger brother quotes Alice Cooper and Iggy Pop. Everybody is absolutely fucking perfect in this movie.[Spoilers now follow for If I Stay]One could argue that they have to be perfect because once Mias familys car plows into an oncoming vehicle with everybody inside it her ghostly consciousness has to take account of all that she has lost. For If I Stay eventually settles on Mias trying to decide whether she should let herself die after a stray whisper from a hospital worker in her comatose ear suggests that she has the power to let go or to stay. On the one hand shes lost so much. On the other hand shes got her cool rocker-bro boyfriend and Juilliard ahead of her. (Yeah she got into Juilliard.) As her spirit-self sprints back and forth through the corridors and rooms of the hospital narrating her predicament the film starts to lose the goodwill created by its earlier scenes and starts to feel just plain silly its approach to loss ruthlessly mathematical. If I Stay wants to show us that Mia had so much promise and happiness in her life. But thats not a movie thats a funeral oration. More often than not stories and characters were invested in come from messier places; its the rough edges of our lives that make us more interesting and human. You keep wanting somebody to act like a jerk in this movie. You want these people to have real challenges and messiness. But their lives dont quite feel lived in; they feel exemplary. And thus Mias predicament never really pops for us. Theres a lot to admire in If I Stay but in the end dont be surprised if you feel very little.

(Doane Gregory/THE ASSOCIATED PRESS) Chloe Grace Moretz plays the cellist daughter of punk-rock parents in If I Stay.(Doane Gregory/THE ASSOCIATED PRESS) Teen drama If I Stay keeps eyes on demographic prize Add to ... Geoff Pevere Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Aug. 22 2014 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Aug. 22 2014 1200AM EDT Comments AA Directed by R.J. Cutler Written by Shauna Cross Starring Chloe Grace Moretz Mireille Enos Jamie Blackley and Joshua Leonard Classification PG Country USA Language English Even when thrown from the family SUV following the fateful collision that will clarify her reason for living Mia (Chloe Grace Moretz) is red-carpet ready Shot with soft focus fully made up dressed in a creamy off-white theme and framed by studio snow she might be comatose but shes ready to rock. Nobody who looks this good could be beat by anything so ordinary as death. Multimedia Liam Laceys 10 films to watch for at Cannes (including three from Canada) Based on the bestselling young-adult novel by Gayle Forman If I Stay is a story of one young womans triumph over trauma told as a series of flashbacks triggered by those possibly fatal potentially final hours when her out-of-body incarnation (unheard and unseen by anyone) comes to realize the meaning of life and struggles to jolt her corporeal self into inspired responsiveness.The prodigiously gifted cello-playing offspring of Portland Ore. punk rockers - Dad (Joshua Leonard) once drummed for an outfit called the Nasty Bruises and Mom (Mireille Enos) thinks Debbie Harry is womanhood incarnate - Mia has fallen for a super-cute local high-school rock star (Jamie Blackley) who impresses Dad with his knowledge of punk arcana but insists Mia follow her dream to go to Juilliard and be the Debbie Harry of cello.There is little doubt throughout If I Stay that Mia will do the right thing as doing the right thing has more or less been her credo since she first heard Schubert and set her sights on following that middlebrow NPR-approved dream. Indeed everyone but her seems to know what an entire movie has been engineered to reinforce that answering the call of the heart is the only true response that life is only worth living if you grab it by the bow and pull.If I Stay is true to principle in one significant regard It makes no concessions to anyone outside its teenage female cohort. If you see anything untoward in its endorsement of glamour as the last and best defence or if you make note of the fact that Moretzs cello-playing has been made possible only via the generous intervention of CGI this movie probably isnt for you.

CutlerCast Chloe Grace Moretz Mireille Enos Jamie Blackley New Richard Roeper reviews weekdays at 500 PM ET only on REELZCHANNEL (1) Post a Comment  Mariasaid on Tuesday August 26 2014 34428 PMMy 12 year old daughter LOVED this movie. Honestly Id thought that Id helped her form better opinions about movies than that. Not that there was anything more cringe-inducing than Twilights ""You better hold on tight Spider Monkey"" ick factor in this movie. Other than the romantic gesture of hand-sucking out a bee stinger in front of admiring strangers. A couple small details really bothered me. We get that the Mom was a punk rocker. The slightly garish make-up meant to remind us of this fact and provide a foil of sorts to the Moretz character (whose make up is deftly done in a very natural way so that you almost dont notice that shes wearing any until at the coffee shop with a high school friend who is NOT made to look effortlessly beautiful) makes Mireille Enos look like a cartoonish hag. Which she is not; she is a beautiful woman. CGMoretz is solid in this cheese fest. Delicious for the theatre full of teenagers.

"Review If I Stay asks life-and-death questions with love as a referee - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review If I Stay asks life-and-death questions with love as a referee If I Stay Movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews If I Stay Starring Chloe Grace Moretz Mireille Enos and Joshua Leonard. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews If I Stay Starring Chloe Grace Moretz Mireille Enos and Joshua Leonard. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter If I Stay is a flat-out all-in fantasy romance an unashamed tear-jerker that is unafraid of glossy emotions ""If I Stay"" adapted from Gayle Formans popular young adult novel is a flat-out all-in fantasy romance an unashamed tear-jerker that is unafraid of glossy emotions. So its no surprise that it comes to us clothed in the bleak garments of death.For in this day and age when previous obstacles to movie passion like differences in wealth status religion or race are not as difficult to overcome as theyve been in the past only the threat of the end of days has enough heft to keep us involved. Though the nominal question at the heart of ""If I Stay"" is whether 17-year-old Mia suspended between life and death after a horrific car accident will choose to stay on Earth or follow the inevitable tunnel of white light to the beckoning next world anyone older than 7 can guess where that is going.Rather if deep-dish cinematic love stories are your vice of choice the pleasure of this film is watching the interplay between Mia (luminously portrayed by Chloe Grace Moretz) and boyfriend Adam (dishy British actor Jamie Blackley) as their dreamy relationship unfolds on the screen in a series of flashbacks. For a story like this to succeed you have to be willing to invest heavily in these characters to enjoy living the dream with them. It should make you happy to see Mia and Adam happy and Moretz and Blackley ensure thats what happens. Video If I Stay The trailer for ""If I Stay."" The trailer for ""If I Stay."" See more videos If you are a romance fan however you also know that putting up with cinematic dross is part of the price to be paid. And as directed by veteran documentarian R.J. Cutler (""The September Issue"" ""The World According to Dick Cheney"") in his dramatic feature debut ""If I Stay"" takes time to find its footing amid miscalculations and awkward moments.As adapted by Shauna Cross ""If I Stay"" is at its weakest in its opening sections introducing Mias too-good-to-be-true family unit which includes dad Denny (Joshua Leonard) an ex-punk rocker now devoted to fatherhood feisty former rock fan and mom Kat (""The Killings"" Mireille Enos) and adorable younger brother Teddy (Jakob Davies).

Moviegoers will likely head to the theaters this weekend with Kleenex in one hand and tickets to the adaptation of the young adult novel ""If I Stay"" in the other. The PG-13 tearjerker is expected to gross a solid 25 million in its opening weekend according to those who have seen pre-release audience... (Saba Hamedy) Its become a wearying trope of todays Hollywood that families especially happy ones are just about mandated to trade glib wisecracks so these otherwise appealing actors take deep breaths and banter away. In between the feeble jests we learn that high school senior Mia is a phenomenal cello player waiting to hear perhaps that very day from first-choice college Juilliard. And that shes been in a relationship with a rising young rocker named Adam that for unspecified reasons is a little rocky at the moment.Mia however is not fated to open her mail that day. She and her family out for a pleasant drive in snowy Portland (unconvincingly substituted for by Vancouver) are involved in the aforementioned accident that in effect ends Mias life as shes known it.Mia however is not dead. It is the conceit of Formans book as well as the film that she emerges from the wreck in an out-of-body state walking and talking and aware of everything including her comatose physical body but invisible to all and sundry.Beyond distraught Mias second self hitches an ambulance ride to the hospital where she learns the fate of her family members and comes to understand that the choice is hers Should she fight to remain alive or should she follow that seductive white light (there really is one) to whatever comes next?""If I Stay"" shuttles between lachrymose developments at the hospital and a series of flashbacks that detail the Mia-Adam relationship. Not surprisingly the romance is where you want to be.The idea is that these two high school students live can you believe it in two different worlds. He is the confident Mr. Hot Indie Rocker the guitarist and front man for an up-and-coming band called Willamette Stone while she is a shy classical music nerd who idolizes Yo-Yo Ma and lives to play the cello.The reality however is that both of these young people are so attractive and well mannered its impossible not to think of them together.Moretz a 17-year-old actress who has already shown impressive range in everything from ""Kick-Ass"" to ""Hugo"" to Olivier Assayas forthcoming ""Clouds of Sils Maria"" displays convincing openness and vulnerability in an irresistible performance and Blackley has the assurance to convincingly handle lines like ""Dont you get it? Youre the same girl I was in love with yesterday and will be in love with tomorrow.""While every moment in ""If I Stay"" is not all that it might be when these two are looking into each others eyes you are not going to care.------------If I StayMPAA rating PG-13 for thematic elements and some sexual materialRunning time 1 hour 43 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Column Entertainment Reviews Literature Chloe Grace Moretz Hugo (movie) 26 young adult novels turned into films Chloe Grace Moretz drama If I Stay is lifeless reviews say If I Stay tops bestseller lists thanks to upcoming film Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad73deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-if-i-stay-review-20140822-column.html,200,ifistay9,ifistay,latimes

By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Aug. 21 2014 1256 p.m. ET 1 COMMENTS The dairy industry doesnt have a monopoly on milking machines. ""If I Stay"" tries to squeeze every last drop of feeling from the plight of its teenage heroine. A gifted musician with nurturing parents Mia (Chloe Grace Moretz) finds herself caught in limbo between life and death after surviving although barely a terrible crash on a snow-covered Oregon highway during a family outing. Surveying the accident scene as an ethereal wraith she can see the loved ones she has lost. She can also see her own shattered body first by the side of the road and then in a coma in the intensive-care unit of a Portland hospital. What she must decide now in the face of her loss is whether to stay among the living. What young audiences will decide soon is whether the movies many moments of genuine sweetness and affecting tenderness can survive the persistent silliness of Mias out-of-body excursions. More Reviews The Trip to Italy Love Is Strange Related Reading Tearjerkers to Hit Cinemas This Fall She is a busybody wraith chasing around the hospital to keep tabs on herself her friends and her extended family while the narrative suffers frequent spasmodic flashbacks to the life she may be leaving. The supernatural element came straight from the book the popular young-adult novel of the same name by Gayle Forman and disembodied heroes or heroines have figured in successful screen entertainments from ""Topper"" through ""Beetlejuice"" to ""Ghost."" But serious drama is trickier as witness the unlovely fate of Peter Jacksons ""The Lovely Bones."" What works for readers left free to produce their own versions of fantasy devices can be gigglesome for audiences confronted with a films prefab literalism. At its best ""If I Stay"" evokes the primacy of friendship the warmth of family--Mireille Enos and Joshua Leonard play Mias lively ex-hippie parents--and the urgency of adolescent love Jamie Blackley as Adam Mias boyfriend has some of the films stronger scenes. (The strongest may be a heartfelt speech by that old pro Stacy Keach who plays Mias grandfather.) But the production as a whole is awfully clumsy and Ms. Moretz who is only 17 needs more help than she gets from the first-time feature director R.J. Cutler. So does Mia stay or go? Lets just say that shes a child of her generation with an unshakable sense of empowerment. Never mind what God or random chance may have in store for her. ""Im running the show"" she declares toward the end. Deathless words from a near-death decider. Rewind DVD //Streaming //Download ENLARGE Spirited Away (2001) Hayao Miyazakis animated masterpiece certainly qualifies as a ghost story but its also a coming-of-age story in which a girl takes refuge in her fantasies and emerges from them a stronger person. The 10-year-old heroine Chihiro finds herself alone after her parents make memorable pigs of themselves at an abandoned restaurant and forges a new life for herself in a glittering steaming hot-springs resort where spirits of every shape disposition and composition--good and evil opaque and transparent--come to refresh themselves. A must-see for film lovers of all ages.

"The F Word If I Stay The One I Love -- three films about romance reviews | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe F Word If I Stay The One I Love -- three films about romance reviews Love is a many splintered thing in The F Word If I Stay and The One I Love three movies opening this week where the paths to romance are broken steps into the unknown.Daniel Radcliffe and Zoe Kazan connect in the Toronto-filmed ""The F Word.""  (MCT)  Chloe Grace Moretz is the (literally) comatose star of If I Stay.  (Doane Gregory / THE ASSOCIATED PRESS)  Elisabeth Moss and Mark Duplass in the oddball romance The One I Love.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Aug. 21 2014The F WordStarring Daniel Radcliffe Zoe Kazan Adam Driver Rafe Spall and Megan Park. Directed by Michael Dowse. Opens Friday Aug. 22 at GTA theatres. 100 minutes. 14AIf I StayArticle Continued BelowStarring Chloe Grace Moretz Jamie Blackley Mireille Enos and Joshua Leonard. Directed by R. J. Cutler. At GTA theatres. 101 minutes. PGThe One I LoveStarring Elisabeth Moss Mark Duplass and Ted Danson. Directed by Charlie McDowell. At the Carlton. 91 minutes. 14ALove is a many splintered thing in The F Word If I Stay and The One I Love three movies opening this week where the paths to romance are broken steps into the unknown.Each film embraces the surreal and/or supernatural as it crosses boundaries of comedy and drama -- and sometimes even sanity. The signpost up ahead has a picture of Cupid scratching his head.Michael Dowses The F Word is the more conventional of the three in the sense that so many love seekers know the dread of the titles metaphorical profanity ""Friend.""Its what you dont want to be called when your heart is going pitter-pat for another. Thats the dilemma for Daniel Radcliffes Wallace a medical school dropout and post-breakup moper who doesnt have much going for him ""I have a dead-end job I live in my sisters attic and I basically never go out.""When he finally does tip-toe from his boy cave he meets the zesty Chantry (Zoe Kazan) who among other things shares his hobby of making ironic statements with fridge magnets. Wallace can feel his frozen heart starting to thaw but then Chantry zaps it with an icy blast. She already has a boyfriend hotshot UN lawyer Ben (Rafe Spall) and theyve been living together for five years.Yet Chantry enjoys being with Wallace so whats a lonely (and horny) dude to do? If he enters into a platonic friendship with this slightly confused gal he risks becoming what the guys in my university dorm used to call ""the palace eunuch."" If he tries to win over Chantry he risks a black eye (or worse) from big and jealous Ben.Not helping matters much is Wallaces randy pal Allan (Adam Driver) whose skill with women is the inverse of Wallaces fumbling.The F Word gets into familiar rom-com situations but they feel different for several reasons. The movie was filmed in Toronto and its uncommonly proud of that fact showing local landmarks that are more than just the CN Tower. Surrealistic animated flourishes add to the charm as does the Canadian title that resists the U.S. name change to the bland and dumb What If.It boasts a prize-winning screenplay which Elan Mastai (also the films executive producer) adapted from the stage play Toothpaste and Cigars. The dialogue is believable and funny even if strays a little too often into the grotesque eating and toilet habits of the late Elvis Presley.Most important of all Radcliffe and Kazan connect as actors even as were teased with guessing whether the palace eunuch will ever storm the barricades.If I Stay also has us wondering but not in a good way. For most of the film Chloe Grace Moretzs character Mia lies in a coma the result of a devastating car accident that also smashed up her family.The question is whether shell flatline or not. The choice between life and death has strangely been left up to her as she wanders in spirit form debating the pros and cons of staying or Earth or heading off yonder.The movie itself needs the cardiac paddles. This overlong adaptation of Gayle Formans popular young adult novel manages to make the usually effervescent Moretz seem dull. I miss the Moretz of Kick-Ass.As we see in extended pre-crash flashbacks Mia is an introverted cellist living in a Portland Oregon family of extrovert punk parents (Mireille Enos and Joshua Leonard). Despite her shyness Mia manages to attract the ardor of cocky local rocker Adam (Jamie Blackley) who has enough confidence for the two of them. Mia must decide between more than the here and the hereafter. The prestigious Julliard School has come knocking and she has to choose between being a respected classical musician or a neglected rock band groupie. Decisions decisions.Director R. J. Cutler hails from documentaries (The War Room The September Issue) and the different rhythms of a dramatic feature clearly elude him. There are long stretches of repetition and ennui all the worse because the outcome of the movie is never in doubt.Screenwriter Shauna Cross (Whip It What To Expect When Youre Expecting) writes as if she were moving around the fridge magnets on the fridge in The F Word. Moretz gives it her all but she gets little help from the charisma-deficient Blackley. If I Stay wants to appeal to fans of The Fault in Our Stars but it only manages to make that film look better in comparison no small feat. You might imagine youre hearing The Twilight Zone theme throughout the curious and very good The One I Love and theres no surprise when Mark Duplass makes reference in it to Rod Serlings old spook show.Duplass is Ethan the dull and serious husband of Sophie played by Mad Mens Elisabeth Moss. The couple used to do wild things together like midnight leaps into the swimming pools of strangers. But the passing years and an affair by the cheatin Ethan has tamed their life and dimmed their passion. Theyre contemplating divorce or at least a separation.Theyre offered a chance to ""reset the reset button"" by their marriage counselor (Ted Danson) who sends them off to a private vacation retreat that has done wonders for his previous clients.Ethan and Sophie soon discover theres more to the place than clean sheets and freshly squeezed orange juice but you dont want to know more than this going in.Suffice to say that the two actors skillfully explore the notion that every couple has of what might life might be like if their mate were ""20 per cent cooler and 20 per cent more involved"" than they normally are.Director Charlie McDowell and screenwriter Justin Lader raise both smiles and pulses with their impressive feature debut which never overplays its sneaky hand.

CAST Chloe Grace Moretz Jamie Blackley Mireille Enos LENGTH 147 What the Liam Neeson action flick ""Taken"" was to middle-age men the Chloe Grace Moretz romance ""If I Stay"" may be to preteen girls cinematic catnip that works best on a particular species. Based on Gayle Formans young-adult bestseller ""If I Stay"" stars Moretz as Mia Hall a high schooler in the suburbs of Portland Ore. Dad is a former punk rock drummer mom a onetime riot grrrl but Mia turned out differently Shes a gifted classical cellist and a goody-goody who doesnt date -- until that is she catches the eye of Adam (Jamie Blackley).

After hearing Mias resonant tones he strides up to her locker. ""You cant hide in that rehearsal room forever"" he says. ""Its too late. I see you."" What girl could turn down a line like that? A romance blossoms but life will intervene. It turns out Merge Records might sign him while Juilliard might want her. What to do? Then comes a terrible car accident that leaves Mia in a coma even as her spirit roams free of her body. This Mia knows is her moment to determine her future. If theres a genius to ""If I Stay"" its the placement of this melodramatic plot twist at the storys beginning. With disaster looming from the get-go the tale of Mia and Adam told in flashbacks takes on added portent. Now their everyday bickering feels fateful swoony and potentially tragic. Or so some viewers will think. 231 MoviesIf I Stay trailer There are other things to enjoy though in ""If I Stay."" One is Moretz 17 who seems a little smarter than her character and another is the empathetic portrayal of Mias hip but well-grounded parents (Joshua Leonard Mireille Enos). ""If I Stay"" is also one of several recent teen films (including ""The Fault in Our Stars"") that mark a countertrend to the escapist fantasias of ""Twilight"" and ""Divergent.""

Pictures) 24 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMOREIts a tough balancing act melding dewy-eyed teen romance with family tragedy and harder still to weave in rousing rock performances and gorgeous classical music.If I Stay ambitiously tries to fuse it all and occasionally succeeds (1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide).Director R. J. Cutler treats the romance and subsequent tragedy with sensitivity and the story creatively imagines a comatose existence painting it as a limbo between life and death.The love story is bland and by-the-book -- indeed it was based on a young-adult novel by Gayle Forman.Screenwriter Shauna Cross is clearly playing to the audience that loved The Fault in Our Stars.USA TODAYFor Chloe Moretz the best part was meeting HillaryUSA TODAYChloe Grace Moretz Filming love scenes is awkwardUSA TODAYFive ridiculous romantic movie premisesUSA TODAYThe latest movie reviewsWhile Chloe Grace Moretz was a standout as a child in films such as Let Me Inand Kick-Ass her performance as a romantic lead is rather lackluster.But she has a challenging assignment since a large portion of her screen time is spent in a passive and watchful vacuum.In half the movie shes a teenager in love and then after a car accident shes suspended watching herself lie comatose. Shes confined to listening and reacting which is difficult to pull off for even the most experienced actor.Moretz plays Mia a shy 17-year-old cellist with dreams of going to Juilliard. She meets Adam (Jamie Blackley) a musician whos a year older and her well-ordered existence is shaken.She has a former-rocker dad (Joshua Leonard) and a onetime groupie mom (Mireille Enos) whose bohemian roots are still evident and are a cause for embarrassment for Mia. The two are devoted to Mia and her adorable younger brother Teddy (Jakob Davies).Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare What should of been a carefree family drive in the movie If I Stay changed in an instant. 17-year-old Mia has to decide between life or death. VPCMias life expands to include Adam and his gigs around town. But that comes to a screeching halt when on a family outing shes in a car accident.The film alternates between flashbacks of Mia playing the cello riffing with her best friend (Liana Liberato) and loving Adam and the grim present with spirit Mia roaming hospital corridors struggling to come to grips with what has happened.She must decide as The Clash once put it ""should I stay or should I go."" A distraught Adam visits her in the hospital guitar in hand. We expect him to launch into The Smiths Girlfriend in a Coma.Predictable visuals such as a recurring scene of Mia walking toward a white light undercut the storys poignant potential. Stilted dialogue also is problematic.Adam refers to his alcoholic father as his ""old man"" which no young person has done in years. He also comes dangerously close to selling Mia on their first sexual experience by describing it as playing beautiful music together.Jaime Blackley as Adam and Chloe? Grace Moretz as Mia Hall in a scene from the motion picture ""If I Stay."" (Photo Doane Gregory Warner Bros. Pictures)The adults fare best. Leonard and Enos have more electricity than the teens do. And the best performance is a low-key authentic one by Stacy Keach as Mias grandfather.Lots of musical names are dropped -- Yo Yo Ma Iggy Pop Debbie Harry and The Ramones -- as if the film is trying to establish some serious cred. Mostly its lip service until a scene with Mia on the cello and Adam on guitar in an outdoor singalong of the Smashing Pumpkins Today. Its a buoyant moment and the first time Mia and Adams professed love for music seems convincing.When it comes to teen romances however filmmakers should refer to The Fault in Our Stars as the gold standard in how to pull off a tearjerker with verve and credibility. 24 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/VIHNbK",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/08/21/if-i-stay-review/12971067/,200,ifistay14,ifistay,usatoday

Artificial slope to open at Buck Hill this fall next Movies In If I Stay Chloe Grace Moretz hovers between life death REVIEW A young car-crash victim hovers between life and death in ""If I Stay"" a first-love tear-jerker that could have aimed higher. August 21 2014 -- 213pm Warner Bros. Chloe Grace Moretz stars in ""If I Stay"" based on the bestselling YA novel by Gayle Forman. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Kristin Tillotson StribKristin Shakespeare knew or maybe came up with the first rule of teenager-in-love tales. There must be parental disapproval of Montague-vs.-Capulet proportions or some other frictional force beyond too-tight jeans to keep them from dissolving into mush. Because it lacks such tension ""If I Stay"" just barely makes the B honor roll despite a fine job by dark-indie darling Chloe Grace Moretz in her mainstream breakout performance. With the complicated roles she already has under her youthful belt -- including a brutal forlorn vampire in ""Let Me In"" and pint-size assassin Hit-Girl in the ""Kick-Ass"" franchise -- 17-year-old Moretz is practically slumming it to portray Mia a good-girl cellist who dreams of going to Juilliard. Relative unknown Jamie Blackley (who is Manx by the way like those tailless cats from the Isle of Man) is Adam frontman for an up-and-coming Portland rock band popular enough to attract groupies wanting him to sign a boob. But Mias parents dont object to him. They used to be him. Dad gave up his gig as drummer for the Nasty Bruises to become a teacher when Mias younger brother Teddy came along and now the mighty tight family unit leads a cheery middle-class boho existence -- until a devastating car accident on a snowy road sends them all to intensive care with Mia in a coma. As in the bestselling YA novel by Gayle Forman on which it is based ""If I Stay"" flits between flashbacks of Mias family life and romance with Adam and the hospital where her invisible spirit self clad in an ethereally adorable sweater/skirt combo has split off from the prone motionless body hooked up to tubes and monitors and can only pad wistfully about observing her grieving loved ones and hearing more bad news. For its appealing leads and touching story line the movie may strike a chord with some starry-eyed kids but not the hippest ones. The ""Smithereens"" of its generation it aint. True fans of both the classical and punk/alt-rock genres will cringe at songs that seem more like the Christmas-gift picks of an out-of-touch uncle than in-the-know peers. Adam name-drops the Ramones and dons a Sonic Youth T-shirt but that cant stop him from looking and sounding like a cross between John Mayer and Harry Styles when he opens his mouth and sweetly strums that guitar. Mia regularly trots out the Prelude from Bachs Cello Suite No. 1 a hackneyed Hollywood favorite and has stickers inside her locker proclaiming that she hearts Yo-Yo Ma. IF I STAY 1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for thematic elements and some sexual material. The supporting cast is serviceable with a couple of standouts. As ex-rocker-chick mom Kat Hall Mireille Enos who till now has seemed destined to play pasty-faced glumsters (""The Killing"" ""Big Love"" ""World War Z"") finally gets to slap on some red lipstick big hair and leopard prints with attitude to match. Though he doesnt get much screen time gruff ol grandpa Stacy Keach owns the movies most powerful hanky-grabbing moment. Keeping vigil at Mias bedside he begs her to hold on while also giving her the OK to let go. So which does she choose? If you dont want to know yet dont read any of the spoiler-filled disclosures by people who have read the book now running rampant online. Its safe to reveal that the movie ends on an abrupt somewhat ambiguous note sparking a ""Huh? What?"" ripple of murmurs from a preview audience. If that keep-em-guessing strategy had been tapped more often throughout it might have elevated this effort from merely acceptable to exceptional.

Pictures Doane Gregory) Dying young is a drag. Just ask those cancer kids from ""The Fault in Our Stars."" But at least they were able to hear and edit their eulogies. In the new tearjerker ""If I Stay"" based on Gayle Formans young adult novel talented teenager Mia (Chloe Grace Moretz) may find herself as the fourth course in a buffet of funerals for her entire family whose car spun out on Dead Mans Curve. Her only hope is to pull out of the coma and start a cello-and-guitar ensemble with her rocker boyfriend Adam (Jamie Blackley).But Adam isnt much help. Every time he barges into the Portland hospital and demands to strum his latest emo composition at Mias bedside the nurses call security.This looks like a job for Ghost Girl. Like the classical musician she plays in the movie Moretz is a rising star. If you dont count the horror flick ""Carrie"" this is her first lead in a love story. The settings and supporting roles suggest that ""If I Stay"" started out as someones passion project but the final product only requires its star to sleepwalk through buckets of schlock.In the timeless ugly-duckling tradition nobody at her high school notices quiet Mia until Adam hears her soloing in the music room. With so many groupies to choose from he picks Mia as his muse. That thrills her still-young parents (Joshua Leonard and Mireille Enos) whose pad is a shrine to the alt-rock lifestyle. (The vintage T-shirts and grunge-era band references are the best thing in the movie.) But Mias main man is Beethoven and as Adams band climbs the ladder of success Mia struggles with her desire to study music in New York City. But theres nothing like a deadly car crash to reorient a girls priorities. A snowy-weekend drive with her family ends at the hospital where the friends and relatives praying for a miracle have an unseen secret weapon Mias disembodied spirit which races around the emergency ward to keep tabs on her battered body.We know from other movies that theres no need to fear the reaper but it seems like bad etiquette that ghost Mia spends so much time worrying about her interrupted relationship with Adam and so little time worrying about her dying parents and little brother. Yet ""If I Stay"" has enough signs of life at the fringes that we suspect it started out as something completely different perhaps a comedy called ""Smells Like Teen Spirit.""What ""If I Stay""  Two stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 146  Content thematic elements and some sexual material Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

Bill Goodykoontz USA TODAY NETWORK 1117 a.m. MST August 21 2014R.J. Cutlers film is the latest in the make-teenage-girls-cry sweepstakes. Its well-meaning but too sappy by design.Chloe Grace Moretz (left) and Jamie Blackley in a scene from the film ""If I Stay.""(Photo Warner Bros. Pictures)Story HighlightsCritics review 2 starsMoretz is the most genuine thing about the film.The parents are especially inauthentic annoyingly so.Cutler means well as does everyone but the film falls short.And you thought your teenage years were dramatic.This summer we have already seen a romance revolving around a teenage girl dying of cancer (""The Fault in Our Stars""). Now with ""If I Stay"" we have the prospect of a teenage girl already in love suffering a horrible tragedy that leaves her clinging to life in a coma where a helpful nurse keeps reminding her that whether she stays or goes is up to her.What about all those surgeons you might wonder? Anyway great sweeping tragedies that produce buckets of tears in the target audience (the very teenage girls who are the protagonists of these films) are like a thing evidently. (Note use of appropriate teen lingo.)For the rest of us theyre just kind of melodramatic tearjerkers. Thats certainly the case with ""If I Stay"" R.J. Cutlers film based on the Gayle Forman novel. The problem is that almost everything in the film feels either forced or false so the tears arent earned.AZCENTRALTop 10 teen romance moviesThere is however one exception Chloe Grace Moretz the teenage girl in question. She has been good in ""Kick-Ass"" and ""Let Me In"" and even the remake of ""Carrie"" (though the movie wasnt much). If you have to watch someone weep her way through a movie shes as good a choice as anyone.Mia (Moretz) is a gifted if unlikely cellist in Portland Ore. Unlikely because her parents (Mireille Enos and Joshua Leonard) are reformed punk rockers -- he was a drummer in a punk band -- and dont really understand her love for the instrument. They do however understand her passion and support her while being as annoyingly ""cool"" in a completely inauthentic focus-group only-in-a-movie way as possible.One day Adam (Jamie Blackley) who leads a rock band thats on the rise in Portland and making noise beyond sees Mia practicing in the music room. He couldnt seem more different from Mia but they fall for each other hard. Soon they are making plans to be together even though their lives would seem to be moving in divergent directions. She applies to Julliard without telling him; his band tours often taking him out of town etc.Then one morning Mia her parents and her little brother (Jakob Davies) are involved in a horrific car accident. Mia lies in a coma but has an out-of-body experience allowing her to see what is going on in the hospital with her family with her friends and of course with Adam and to remember the development of her relationship with him.AZCENTRALAll the reviews Weekend movie guide for PhoenixCutler goes back and forth between past and present as Mia fights for her life. In case youre not sad enough he also supplies a mournful emo soundtrack. If youre still not sad enough everyone cries a lot all but inviting you to join them. Cutler gives you all the tools to break down. All you have to do is comply.Stacy Keach as Mias grandfather gets an honest-to-goodness heartfelt speech. And Moretz is good throughout bringing authentic feeling to sometimes inauthentic situations.The whole thing is loaded with good intentions. But when Adam sits by Mias hospital bed talking to her despite the coma and whips out his guitar to sing the song he finally wrote for her (hes not good at writing about things that make him happy -- of course) you wonder how the actors kept a straight face.The audience didnt.Not that this matters. If youre a 14-year-old girl this is cathartic. If youre anyone else its formulaic. Proceed accordingly.Review If I Stay 2 starsDirector R. J.

Comments click to enlarge If I Stay Video Rated PG-13  107 minutes  2014 Cheesy barely begins to describe this maudlin tearjerker adapted from a young-adult novel about a 17-year-old girl (Chloe Grace Moretz) who suffers a nasty car accident slips into a coma and has an out-of-body experience. Her parents and younger brother have died in the crash so she has to decide whether she wants to move on to the next life with them or stay on earth with her on-again off-again rocker boyfriend (Jamie Blackley). In the fashion of melodrama every moment is impossibly huge and the movie is occasionally compelling in its brazen lack of subtlety. There are even shades of Bergman in the existential premise but director J.R. Cutler is more interested in the young leads cookie-cutter romance and the clunky nonlinear plot precludes any sort of comprehensive narrative. With Joshua Leonard and Mireille Enos.

Pictures Doane Gregory) Photo Doane Gregory Associated Press Movie review If I Stay is a trite teen tearjerker 1 / 3 Back to Gallery If I Stay Drama. Directed by R.J. Cutler. With Chloe Grace Moretz Jamie Blackley. Mireille Enos Joshua Leonard Stacy Keach. (PG 106 minutes.) ""If I Stay"" based on Gayle Formans popular novel for young adults is likely to appeal to youthful fans of the book and the movies star Chloe Grace Moretz an audience that may not recognize the cliched situations and the artless dialogue for what they are. Older moviegoers (and more discerning teenagers) are unlikely to be attracted to this unabashed tearjerker. The film adds a fantasy gimmick to a teens-in-love story. Sweet-natured Mia (Moretz) the 17-year-old daughter of two ex-rockers (Mireille Enos Joshua Leonard) is a talented cellist who hopes to get into Juilliard. Thats a problem because her boyfriend Adam (Jamie Blackley) is a member of a rising band that spends a lot of time on the road. A long-distance relationship (the film is set in Portland) doesnt appeal to him. Driving on a snowy road Mias family is decimated by a horrendous car crash that leaves her in a coma. At this point we are introduced to a second Mia disembodied who is able to observe things but cant interact with the world. A nurse whispers to the comatose girl that its up to her to fight to live. Were spoon-fed the complications of her relationship with Adam via flashback but the movies heart consists of disembodied Mia trying to decide if its worth coming back to life. Theres a wholesomeness here thats hard to take and the film looks Disneyfied (though Disney had nothing to do with it) and prettified. The characters are too cute and too earnest. Even the music performed by Adam (and by Mias dad in flashback) is remarkably tame. Director R.J. Cutler avoids subtlety and lays the syrup on thick as if he were directing an after-school special. The troubled relationship of the two leads seems well trivial and there isnt much chemistry between the actors. The scenes set at the hospital are shameless emotionalism. Viewers vulnerable to this sort of thing are advised to bring a handkerchief or two. The redoubtable Stacy Keach is on hand in a small role as Mias grandfather his main function being to deliver the granddaddy of all schmaltzy addresses to the unconscious young woman. Which brings up a key problem The script by Shauna Cross is rife with shopworn and underwhelming lines and exchanges. (""Sometimes you make choices and sometimes choices make you."") Moretz is an appealing young woman whose star is rising. Shell probably have an exceptional career but ""If I Stay"" wont be a highlight. Walter Addiego is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

A teen girl reflects on her life while in a coma. Director R.J. Cutler (146). PG-13 Disturbing themes and images sexuality. Area theaters. Full disclosure I went through half a pack of Kleenex watching ""If I Stay."" But know this those tears are no more honestly earned than if director R.J. Cutler had merely been chopping onions in front of me. Who wouldnt well up watching a teenage girl survive a horrifically devastating car crash only to fall into a life-threatening coma? The problem is we can feel each heartstring being tugged almost mechanically. The movie is designed not to explore the experience of illness or first love or adolescence but merely to make us swoon sigh and sob. Cutler and screenwriter Shauna Cross are generally successful in those limited goals it must be said. But theyve adapted Gayle Formans popular young adult novel in undeniably broad fashion turning Formans characters into central casting representations rather than people we can imagine existing. Chloe Grace Moretz is the Shy Prodigy a high school cellist called Mia. Her Cool Parents (Mireille Enos Joshua Leonard) wish shed get out and have some fun which finally happens when she meets a Sensitive Hot Guy named Adam (Jamie Blackley). They fall madly in love but their idyll is shattered when a family drive goes tragically wrong. Mia exits her own body to watch herself at the hospital where she lies comatose and near death. A nurse whispers in her ear urging her to fight and insisting she has the power to choose her fate. So Mia thinks back on her recent history even as her current situation deteriorates alternately resisting and embracing the eternal light that beckons her. Chloe Grace Moretz as Mia Hall in ""If I Stay"" (Doane Gregory) Cutler aims directly for his target audience without worrying about pleasing anybody else. A cynic might chafe at the thematic simplicity lack of character development and cliche-riddled dialogue. A sentimentalist will be more likely to embrace the sincere performances emotional upheaval and romantic wish fulfillment. Of course the irreverent yet intelligent teen drama ""The Fault in Our Stars"" managed to honor fantasy and kids reality simultaneously. ""If I Stay"" repeatedly reminds us that life is messy even as it glosses over the actual messiness of life and death. Chloe Grace Moretz in R.J.

"If I Stay review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review If I Stay  If I Stay a full frontal assault on your tear ducts Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips reviews the Chloe Grace Moretz starring ""If I Stay"" and compares it to this years similarly themed YA release ""The Fault In Our Stars."" Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips reviews the Chloe Grace Moretz starring ""If I Stay"" and compares it to this years similarly themed YA release ""The Fault In Our Stars."" Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune If I Stay is better than average tear-stained young adult material with Chloe Grace Moretz. Artfully assaultive ""If I Stay"" is better than average young adult material cleverly adapted from Gayle Formans 2009 novel about a teenage cellist experiencing true love a terrible car crash and magical realism for the first time.Young adult fiction comes in too many shapes sizes and qualities to court generalizations. But here goes. Director R.J. Cutler who comes out of documentaries reality TV (""Flip That House"") and series television (""Nashville"") has succeeded with ""If I Stay"" where several recent movies taken from teen-aimed fiction have come up a little short. I liked this one more than ""Divergent"" for example or -- the more apt comparison point utopia trumping dystopia -- ""The Fault in Our Stars"" which was more or less saved by Shailene Woodley as the cancer patient staring mortality and her first serious boyfriend squarely in the face. ""If I Stay"" ups the dramatic stakes. Chloe Grace Moretz is Mia an obsessively devoted cellist aiming for a Juilliard tryout growing up in an idyllic funky Portland Ore. household. Mom (Mireille Enos) and Dad (Joshua Leonard looking considerably less spooked than he was in ""The Blair Witch Project"") come from the alt-rock world. Mia who has a younger brother does not which sets her at odds with her surroundings but not in such a way as to make anyone raise their voices and disturb the domestic tranquillity.By senior year though Mia has fallen hard for a slightly older boy in a band of great promise. Adam played by Jamie Blackley represents one option for Mias future. Stay in the Portland area and move in with Mr. Right YA rocker division? Or follow the Juilliard dream? Fate intervenes in the form of a wintertime car accident which leaves two members of her family dead and two more hanging in the balance. ""If I Stay"" becomes the tale of a new set of options for Mia Live or die? After the accident which leaves her in a coma shes able to observe her present crisis as well as events and developments of her recent past the way Scrooge did in ""A Christmas Carol."" Mias fate is presented entirely as a matter of will and personal choice. As the wise nurse in attendance (Aisha Hinds) utters ""If she wants to live she better start fighting."" If I Stay Doane Gregory / Warner Brothers/New Line Cinema Chloe Grace Moretz and Jamie Blackley star as Mia and Adam in ""If I Stay"" a film adaptation of Gayle Formans novel. Chloe Grace Moretz and Jamie Blackley star as Mia and Adam in ""If I Stay"" a film adaptation of Gayle Formans novel. (Doane Gregory / Warner Brothers/New Line Cinema) Working from Shauna Cross script director Cutler doesnt treat this fantastical premise for anything resembling grit. Each scene every aspect of Mias romance the one we see unfolding in flashbacks is perfectly coiffed with the cinematographer John de Borman pouring on the saturated colors and the appealing shadows. Yet theres a compelling push-pull to the Mia/Adam relationship and its stressors more nuanced than you usually get in this sort of thing. And while the target audience may prefer the more benign and placating lessons of ""Fault in Our Stars"" (live for today seize life grab the bull by the horns et al.) scene to scene theres more going on in ""If I Stay."" When Stacy Keach for example settles in at the hospital bedside in the role of Mias grandfather Cutler has the good sense to park his camera and let a seasoned actor do his job which is to make the audience cry. Check out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune. As a busy star on the rise Moretz I suspect has a lot to tune out as a young actress even if she doesnt read the troll-ridden comments board at IMDb.com. Shes learning as she goes though like anybody shes at the mercy of the movie shes in. Sometimes her wide-eyed emoting would benefit from more distance from the camera; she has a way of hitting one note hard rather than working in chords. But in her scenes with Blackley who nearly makes the dreamy love interest a human being some emotional truth emerges. Cutler is selling a certain kind of product with ""If I Stay"" but he sells it honestly and well.""If I Stay"" - 3 stars MPAA rating PG-13 (for thematic elements and some sexual material)Running time 147Opens Fridaymjphillipstribune.com Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Movies Traffic Accidents Television Industry Literature Reviews Chloe Grace Moretz Aisha Hinds Review Sin City A Dame to Kill For  Review The Trip to Italy  1/2 Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising70deg",http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/chi-if-i-stay-20140821-column.html#navtype=barker&barkername=Barker%2006%20-%20In%20Case%20You%20Missed%20It,200,ifistay21,ifistay,chicagotribune
"If I Stay | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; if-i-stay ) If I Stay (United States 2014) August 21 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli If I Stay answers the burning question of what The Sixth Sense might look like if the screenplay had been written by Nicholas Sparks. Of course Sparks had nothing to do with this film - its based on a popular YA novel written by Gayle Forman - but thats the vibe. The supernatural element that differentiates this from every other teen romance novel is underemployed. The plot device could have been used in countless different and interesting ways but it isnt. Distilled to its essence If I Stay represents an unremarkable opposites-attract high school love affair. What gives it life and keeps us interested isnt the flashback structure or the use of a ghostly apparition but the luminous performance of Chloe Grace Moretz. The movies ""present"" is a snow day for Portlands schools. High school senior Mia (Chloe Grace Moretz) accompanies her parents Kat (Mireille Enos) and Denny (Joshua Leonard) and her young brother Teddy (Jakob Davies) on a family outing that ends in tragedy. 15 minutes into If I Stay Mia is in an ambulance on the way to the hospital. Denny and Teddy are also en route but Kat is pronounced dead at the car accident scene. At this point the story diverges from the norm by having a ""spirit Mia"" accompany Mias body to the hospital. This ""spirit Mia"" can move and observe but not interact. Most importantly she can remember and this allows her to relate the story of Mias past life while the teenagers future hangs in the balance. Although much screen time is devoted to the romance between cellist Mia and rock-and-roll band singer Adam (Jamie Blackley) their love story is sufficiently generic to strike a few sour notes. The chemistry between the actors is lukewarm and the Mia/Adam coupling seems more like one of those desperate high school pairings that flares brightly and burns out rather than the potential anchor capable of keeping an indecisive girls spirit from fleeing her broken body. If director R.J. Cutler was trying to achieve something profound with this romance he misses the mark. On the other hand one aspect that works is Mias loving relationship with her parents and brother. At a time when almost every screen family is dysfunctional its refreshing to encounter one in which both parents love each other and their children and where strife is minimal and support is emphasized. There are a lot of nice little touches and as the flashbacks unfold this magnifies the tragedy. In the end the love between Mia and Adam seems like a paltry artificial thing when seen in the shadow of the bigger picture. The movie plays to the same crowd that adored this summers better more heartfelt drama The Fault in Our Stars. That movie was smarter better written and earned its tears. If I Stay demands that viewers bring Kleenexes to the theater but the story is more obviously manipulative and it lacks the freshness and wit that kept The Fault in Our Stars from becoming depressing. Although If I Stay tries to be life-affirming its more of a downer because the films frequent returns to the grim uncertain present cast a pall over everything. The acting is solid across the breadth of the cast with all the actors fitting nicely into their roles. Mortez is especially good; she brings humanity and believability to Mia. That we sympathize deeply with the plight of this character is as much Mortezs doing as it is the screenplays. As the apparition Moretz is suitably dazed and confused but she shines in the flashbacks by conveying the thrills and heartbreak of first love with conviction. Another acting standout is Stacy Keach the veteran tough guy who stays mostly in the background playing Mias grandfather until the script gives him an opportunity for a moving bedside monologue. One of the most curious aspects of If I Stay is the way it rigorously ignores religion and spirituality. With the exception of an undefined ""white light"" image that recurs the movie never once mentions ""God"" (as an entity). For a movie that is so much about death it seems like an odd omission. I dont know if this is a characteristic of the book but it seems that a character stuck in limbo might be curious about an afterlife and the principalities controlling her existence. The movies unwillingness to go to this level perhaps believing it to be too deep or existential for the target audience is its most significant failing. If I Stay offers an adequate love story but a shallow exploration of bigger issues. If I Stay (United States 2014) Director R.J.

Richard Corliss Aug. 20 2014 SHARE A24 Aubrey Plaza center plays Beth Slocum in Life After Beth Submitted for your late-summer dubious pleasure Aubrey Plaza as a cute zombie with eating issues and Chloe Grace Moretz as a comatose teen who must decide whether to rejoin the living The drama that plays out in the Kubler-Ross five stages of grief has a happy ending -- sort of. After denial anger bargaining and depression comes the balm of acceptance. But what if your beloved died from a snake bite and was buried and then shows up undead? She (Aubrey Plaza) has forgotten that she was about to break up with you (Dane DeHaan) and now loves you more than ever. Shes also a decomposing cannibal. If thats your lot you may undergo the five stages of zombie-girlfriend response depression shock lust bargaining and throw-her-off-a-cliff. Or how about this You are the one whos the near dead girl (Chloe Grace Moretz) who is in a coma after a car crash that may have totaled the rest of your family. As doctors work desperately to revive you your spirit wanders through the hospital and into flashbacks of your love affair with a budding rock star (Jamie Blackley). You understand that youll come back to life only if you can summon the heroic resolve to carry on amid the most plangent heartbreak. Will you? (FIND Chloe Grace Moretz among TIMEs Top Movie Performers of 2010) In the dying light of summer come two movies about girls who are not quite dead. Life After Beth is what Plaza from Parks and Recreation describes as a ""zom-com-rom-dram"" -- its mostly com but it puts a weird spin on the solemn subject of how the living rationalize the death of a loved one. If I Stay based on Gayle Formans YA best seller is a straightforward tearjerker that creates a union of two beautiful people (Moretzs Mia Hall and Blackleys Adam Wilde) so it can tear it apart to pose the Clashs eschatological question Should I stay or should I go? Neither film is mandatory viewing though each has its appealing aspects. Doane Gregory--Warner Bros.Chloe Grace Moretz plays Mia Hall in If I Stay. If I Stay directed by documentarian R.J. Cutler (The September Issue) and scripted by Shauna Cross rounds up all the YA cliches like cattle without applying the brand of its own personality -- think The Fault in Our Stars but substitute a car crash for terminal cancer. Filmed in Vancouver but set in Portland Ore. the movie draws Mias family as an adorably boho bunch father Denny (Joshua Leonard) a rock drummer turned music teacher; perky-cool mom Kat (Mireille Enos); and Mias much younger brother Teddy (Jakob Davies) who quotes Iggy Pop. Its a Norman Rockwell portrait of an indie-rock clan rendered in glaucomic soft focus and ripe for parody in the IFC sketch-com Portlandia -- a connection soldered by Blackleys resemblance to a younger much cuter Fred Armisen. All the Halls overflow with such snug smug warmth that the gods are pretty much obliged to punish them for excess adorability. Cue the familys dreadful crash; the fault is their car. (READ Richard Corlisss review of The Fault in Our Stars) Something of a misfit anachronism in the family Mia loves Beethoven and Bach whose suites she listens to on her bedroom phonograph and dreams of admission to the Juilliard School on the other edge of the continent. Yet following the folk wisdom that a girl marries her father Mia falls for indie rocker Adam who seems destined for stardom despite sporting neither skull tattoos nor outlaw attitude. He loves this cello girl and behaves like a gentleman except for a few instances when the plot forces him into spasms of sullen prickitude over Mias ambition to follow her own star to New York City. In her coma state as she wanders unseen by others but occasionally felt like Patrick Swayze in Ghost she is a Sleeping Beauty trying to decide if she needs a resurrecting kiss. (Not much suspense there since fans of the source novel know that Forman wrote a sequel Where She Went featuring the same characters.) The reason to catch this death-flirting borderline-deplorable weepie is totally Chloe. Not long ago she was a preternaturally poised child star as the elfin superheroine of Kick-Ass and the vampire darling of Let Me In. Moretz has matured into a gorgeous 17-year-old whose wide face and pensive intelligence reward a viewers rapt attention. Usually playing a girl far hipper than her age she must somehow convince audiences that she is a shy prodigy of the cello who when sensitive stud Adam takes fond notice of her nearly wilts in his love light and wonders ""Why me?"" You may wonder how Moretz landed in the Cartoonistan of this dewy melodrama and chalk it up to alien abduction. Yet she almost convinces you solely on the power of her commitment. (READ Mary Pols on Chloe Grace Moretz in Let Me In) The vibe is deader and more deadpan in Life After Beth the first feature from Jeff Baena (who co-wrote David O. Russells strenuously wacky I Heart Huckabees a decade ago). DeHaan is Zach Orfman devastated by the loss of his beloved Beth. Shopping for the right gift for her memorial service he asks a clerk if the store has black napkins. (Thats ""more of a Halloween item"" the clerk replies.) He gets sympathetic counseling from Beths parents Maury (John C. Reilly) and Geenie (Molly Shannon) but soon finds theyre concealing something the late Beth. Her parents want to believe she is not zombiefied but resurrected -- Sleeping Beauty miraculously awakened. Evidence points to the contrary her skin cracks in daylight she has a habit of munching strangers and car upholstery and she has developed a bizarre hankering for smooth jazz. Zach is at first elated and aroused but cautious. ""You dont wanna eat me?"" he asks as they loll by the backyard pool. ""I mean like really eat me."" Since George Romeros 1968 Night of the Living Dead revived the zombie movie filmmakers have played the genre for laughs (Shaun of the Dead) and love (Warm Bodies). Baenas Romero-and-Juliet vamp could be called Night of the Laughing Dead or Yawn of the Dead depending on whether you buy the notion of a nice girl who develops some unhealthy habits. At first Beth seems to be only chronologically addled; shes ""worried about my test tomorrow."" (""But its the summer"" Zach says and Beth groans ""I wish."") Soon the movie tries to freeze that querulous smile on your face into a rictus. Beth starts to decay (""Sweetie"" Zach whispers as they kiss ""your breath"") and then to embrace her fate with wondrous fury. When Zach observes that Beth just ""ate a guy"" she thunders ""What do you want from me? Im a f-cking zombie. Zombies eat guys."" (READ Mary Pols on the zombies in Warm Bodies) Packing its cast with veteran comic actors (Paul Reiser and Cheryl Hines as Zachs parents Garry Marshall as a zombie grandpa) and one eligible youngster (Anna Kendrick as Zachs long-ago still smitten classmate) Life After Beth gets a nice defibrillating jolt from the two leads. Plaza whose wide-eyed stare suggests a zombie as painted by Margaret Keane plausibly navigates Beths journey into full-throttle Linda Blair demonic dementia. DeHaan who made his first big impression on HBOs In Treatment and played Peter Parkers nemesis Harry Osborn in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 always looks as if he had just been told of a loved ones demise and has taken medication to soothe the shock. That makes Zach a role he was born to play. For half the movie Zach can ignore the Kubler-Ross guidelines. Hes just thrilled that Beth is back and hot for his caress. Sure shes a zombie -- but nobodys perfect. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Rated PG-13 (language intense situations). Love that never dies is so two years ago; these days its in-your-face mortality that gets the kids going. Or so the maudlin ""If I Stay"" is hoping with its comatose narrator Mia (Chloe Grace Moretz) clinging to life while her spirit roams the hospital thinking mostly about a cute boy (Jamie Blackley). Pre-accident Mia is the black sheep of her unconventional Oregonian family. While her parents (Mireille Enos Joshua Leonard) are a former riot grrrl and a drummer shes a classical-music nerd who lives to play the cello. Her musical passion catches the eye of school hunk Adam (Blackley) a rocker who takes her to the symphony on their first date. Their love spawns a series of diary-worthy voice-overs by Mia like ""Being with Adam was like learning to fly -- exciting and scary at the same time."" But this is mostly flashback as Mia and her family are in a car crash early on. Wandering the wreckage barefoot Mia wonders why no ones talking to her -- until she sees herself on a stretcher. Its all very ""Touched by an Angel"" especially the nurse who leans over to whisper in Mias ear ""You control this whole thing baby. If you live if you die its all up to you."" Director R.J. Cutler structures the rest of the film -- based on the Gayle Forman novel -- as a sort of ""This is Your Life"" with Mia sorting through various memories which tend teen-girl style to drift back to Adam The time he sucked a bee sting out of her hand the time they did it in the picturesque old boat shed the time he gave her a bracelet adorned with both a cello and a guitar. Eventually their love is tested by rival musical interests His band regularly takes him on the road while she hopes to move east to attend Juilliard. Moretz fierce in last years overly maligned ""Carrie"" has little to do here. Her character is so virtuous shes practically angelic even before she starts seeing the white light at the end of the hospital hallway. Enos and Leonard fare better as her parents a bohemian pair befuddled by the fact that their kid worships Yo-Yo Ma instead of Yo La Tengo. Blackley is both a decent singer and a respectably dishy love interest. But compared to another recent teen weepie ""The Fault in Our Stars"" this one comes up wanting. That films strong point was the delight its heroine took in detonating romantic cliches; ""If I Stay"" seems determined to keep them on life support.

A recent essay in Slate groused about the legions of adults who long ago graduated from the 12th grade but still devour YA fiction at the expense of everything else. Now that so many YA novels are being turned into movies -- this summer alone has brought us adaptations of John Greens blockbuster The Fault in Our Stars and Lois Lowrys much-loved 1993 The Giver -- maybe we should be asking similar questions about film. Should real grown-ups be shelling out for say Expendables 3 or is it OK if theyre more attracted to If I Stay R.J. Cutlers movie version of Gayle Foremans 2009 novel about teenage tragedy teenage love and well more teenage tragedy? A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Theres no universal answer to that question but it does point toward one of the more vexing problems of moviegoing culture as its reflected in the multiplex Given the dearth of dramas about real-life grown-up problems especially in summertime movies adapted from young-adult novels are about the best we can hope for. Even when theyre not great they fill a need for teenagers and grown-ups alike. If youre in the mood for a story about humans who are a little less expendable you could do worse than spend an air-conditioned afternoon watching If I Stay.Chloe Grace Moretz plays Mia a teenage rebel though not the sort youd expect Her parents (Mireille Enos and Joshua Leonard) are former rock n rollers who gave up the world of ear-splitting volume and cheap draft beer to raise their two kids -- Mias little brother is played by Jakob Davies -- quietly and responsibly in a town not far from Portland. Mia loves music too but shes much more straitlaced than her parents Shes a disciplined cellist with dreams of attending Juilliard. The cutest and coolest guy in her school an aspiring rock guitarist named Adam (Jamie Blackley) spies her practicing alone in a classroom one day and zing go the strings of his heart. He asks her out to a classical concert even though hes more of a Vampire Weekend guy. They begin dating and Mia even takes tentative steps toward liking his band which thanks to Adams considerable charms as a frontman is edging closer and closer to a record deal (or what passes for one these days).Film Details If I Stay RatingPG-13 GenreDrama Running Time106 More Info Trailer But petty resentments can creep in even when youre living the teenage dream. Plus tragedy strikes and it does so pretty early on Mia and her family suffer a serious car accident one that puts Mia in a coma. While flesh-and-blood Mia lies in a hospital bed right at the crossroads of life and death out-of-body Mia drifts around listlessly reflecting on her recent past and asking herself the same question the Clash once posited Should I stay or should I go? Its the ultimate teenage fantasy an extension of the ""Youd be sorry if I died"" retort so beloved by melodramatic 15-year-olds everywhere. Imagine lying in a coma and having your on-again off-again boyfriend tearfully creep to your bedside and say amazing things about how much he cares for you. He even writes a song just for you -- something hed never before done -- and he sits by your bed and plays it for you on his guitar. Its kind of a crap song but stillTheres something morbidly gratifying about the supercalifragilistically supernatural elements of If I Stay even if the movie isnt ultimately as effective as it could be. The last third drags as the list of tragic reasons for Mia to step toward that beckoning white light just grows and grows. But Cutler -- who made the superb 2009 Vogue magazine documentary The September Issue which turned stylist supreme Grace Coddington into a sort-of household name -- is hardly a bumbler and he approaches all these teenage hyperfeelings with respect and sensitivity. It doesnt hurt that he has Moretz in his corner. At a certain point If I Stay takes a maudlin turn and just keeps going. Somehow though Moretz is strong enough to carry it. She makes out-of-body Mias excessive soul-searching seem wholly believable Theres a vulnerable softness to her eyes that suggests she really is thinking and feeling all the time suspended in that gel of emotional turmoil we remember as teenagerhood. Shes best though in a scene in which Mia describes to her best friend (Liana Liberato) how she feels when shes watching her boyfriend onstage playing a type of music she doesnt even particularly like. ""When hes up there"" she says ""I just wanna lick the side of his face."" Her lip curls into the faintest Joan Jett sneer -- and youre never too old to understand what thats about.
