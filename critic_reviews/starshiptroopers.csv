The scope and abundance of the special effects --- from the countless and incredibly vivid marauding bugs to the plethora of agile aircraft of the Earths space fleet --- may well surpass anything seen before while the ""just war"" against an implacably hostile foe supplies plenty of rooting interest. The frequent violence has a grisliness that will put off some older viewers and may create a backlash against the picture in certain quarters but sci-fi fans and younger general audiences always looking for the latest edge to be pushed will eat it up creating strong B.O. worldwide for the first holiday blockbuster out of the box. Human culture and insect culture duel to the death in ""Starship Troopers"" a spectacularly gung-ho sci-fi epic that delivers two hours of good nasty fun. The scope and abundance of the special effects -- from the countless and incredibly vivid marauding bugs to the plethora of agile aircraft of the Earths space fleet -- may well surpass anything seen before while the ""just war"" against an implacably hostile foe supplies plenty of rooting interest. The frequent violence has a grisliness that will put off some older viewers and may create a backlash against the picture in certain quarters but sci-fi fans and younger general audiences always looking for the latest edge to be pushed will eat it up creating strong B.O. worldwide for the first holiday blockbuster out of the box. Putting ""Showgirls"" safely behind him director Paul Verhoeven returns to the futuristic vein in which he excelled in ""Total Recall"" and especially ""Robocop"" while adding a measure of teen romance into the bargain. Lavishly produced effort has the momentum heavy action and all-for-one camaraderie of prototypical World War II battle films but with an arrestingly high-tech outer-space setting. It is in the end a picture about teenagers and giant bugs but one with enough visual exhilaration and narrative wit to keep one thoroughly on board. Working from a long-celebrated (and very right-wing) novel by Robert A. Heinlein ""Robocop"" co-scripter Ed Neumeier and Verhoeven start off with a teaser TV transmission from the distant planet of Klendathu where a military emergency has developed in the worldwide Federal government armys battle with the resident arthropods. Just enough gruesome fighting is revealed to cement the promise of much more to come. Flashing back a year attention alights upon several good-looking high school seniors in the process of deciding what theyre going to do with the rest of their lives. Expected to go to college rich boy Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien) is disowned by his father when he abruptly enlists in the Mobile Infantry a decision prompted by the fact that his girlfriend Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards) is heading for the Fleet Academy to become a pilot. While Carmen is off in training school becoming chummy with instructor Zander Barcalow (Patrick Muldoon) Johnny finds himself in basic training with the sultry ultra-fit Dizzy Flores (Dina Meyer) a former schoolmate who has the permanent hots for him. Opening reels have the flavor of a pleasantly corny old-fashioned adolescent melodrama full of hopping hormones unrequited lust and sexual rivalry shot through with a tangy taste reminiscent of Verhoevens ""Spetters"" and toughened up with some boot camp brutality. Even in the early going some interesting political layering is introduced. At this unspecified date in the future any and all military differentiation based on gender has passed into ancient history which allows the women in the story to take an active battle role and incidentally permits Verhoeven to include an amusing and sexy coed group shower scene. At the same time the Federal government while never described in detail is clearly of a fascistic nature a fact most prominently underlined by the Nazi-style uniforms sported by the young soldiers. When Johnnys native city of Buenos Aires is destroyed by an arachnid asteroid launched by the distant bug culture the young man quickly has to get over the Dear John video mail he just received from Carmen and prepare to lead his unit into battle. At the one-hour point the invasion of Klendathu begins and pic shifts into fifth gear without ever looking back. Once they get a close look at their opponents the humans realize they have significantly underestimated them. The warrior bugs far bigger than people are veritable killing machines with stiletto legs razor-sharp armored bodies and pincer mouths. Multiple blasts from futuristic machine guns will ultimately put them down but like self-respecting insects everywhere they dont expire easily. And there are so many of them. The first encounter is a disaster for the army with some 100000 dead. Nonetheless Johnnys unit allows itself to be lured to a distant fort that recently witnessed a massacre and soon learns why the enemy is smarter than originally thought The bugs have sucked the brains out of the defeated humans thereby acquiring all their knowledge. Cornered at this remote outpost the soldiers are shortly confronted with a blood-chilling spectacle the sight of thousands of warrior bugs descending from the surrounding mountains with another brain-drain in mind. In terms of cinema the sheer spectacle of the sequence recalls the beginning of the climactic battle in ""Zulu""; in terms of the story it forces the humans to the limit of their resourcefulness which is what gives them a fighting chance. Mixed in with the hand-to-hand combat on an otherwise lifeless planetary surface is some spectacular space action in which giant battleships are set afire by huge effusions of arthropodal spittle requiring quick escapes by Carmen and Zander among others. The Us-vs.-Them aspect of the story could not have been more clearly stated creating a context in which the fascistic underpinnings become rather interesting. On the one hand the Big Government society depicted is one that has achieved the dream so widely idealized today a sexual racial and ethnic parity so thorough so as not to be worthy of comment. Another given is the necessity of harnessing all resources to battle a truly imposing ""foreign"" foe. On the other hand there is a way in which human beings become something resembling insects themselves in a militaristic totalitarian state and the irony of humans being as cavalierly treated in this story as bugs are by people is not ignored by the filmmakers. All this is subtext however in relation to the action and special effects both of which just keep on coming. Aside from some early matte work the effects in all departments are seamless and so omnipresent as to convincingly create an independent universe. Main credit for the scary and incisive insect creations goes to Phil Tippett a crucial collaborator on ""Robocop"" and an Oscar winner for ""Jurassic Park."" Many other hands contributed key elements of the films many components and the reputed  100 million budget decidedly shows onscreen. The vigor and enthusiasm of Verhoevens direction easily sweep the viewer into and along with the broad strokes of the story. Bringing back numerous cohorts from previous pictures helmer has been aided by the bold lensing of Jost Vacano high-octane editing by Mark Goldblatt and Caroline Ross imaginative work from production designer Allan Cameron and costume designer Ellen Mirojnick and a muscular score by Basil Poledouris. Young and virtually unknown cast is serviceable with Van Dien a stalwart lead and Meyer standing out as the professionally fearless but emotionally vulnerable Dizzy. Given the multi-ethnic backdrop pic might have benefited from something other than white-bread thesps in all the most important roles. Much of the action is certainly gruesomely violent to the extent that the R rating aside the film would be a bit much for most viewers under 15 or so. On the other hand the hard-charging pace means that nothing is dwelled upon and there are no heart-stopping shocks or excruciatingly protracted scenes of physical torture. Just a lot of very mean bugs. Buena Vista Intl. is distributing in overseas territories.

"Starship Troopers | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; starship-troopers ) Starship Troopers (United States 1997) A movie review by James Berardinelli Whenever a motion picture tackles a literary classic of any genre fans of the written work hold their collective breaths hoping for the best but dreading the worst. On rare occasions something like The Godfather emerges -- a movie that not only fulfills the promise of the book but improves upon it. Unfortunately most of the time were saddled with atrocities like Bram Stokers Dracula or Leo Tolstoys Anna Karenina. And while its unfair to lump science fiction writer Robert Heinlein into the same category as Tolstoy the author is a recognized great in his chosen genre and 1959s Starship Troopers represents one of his best-known novels. So what about the film? Those anticipating a rigorous adaptation will be dismayed. On the other hand anyone in the mood for a ""popcorn movie"" experience will find that Starship Troopers fills the role handsomely. Probably the best way to approach Starship Troopers is to divorce it from its intelligent and gripping pedigree. Many of the most intellectually stimulating aspects of the book have been stripped away and those that remain are only shadows of their former selves. (Its still a lot smarter than Independence Day however.) Viewers offended by the ""watering down"" of themes in this summers superlative motion picture version of Contact will be horrified by what has happened here. Nevertheless taken on its own terms the movie entity Starship Troopers offers an enjoyable two hours. At its best the film recaptures the kind of taut visceral thrills offered by James Camerons Aliens. At its worst it replicates the feel of a futuristic episode of TVs Beverly Hills 90210. Starship Troopers represents director Paul Verhoevens comeback attempt after the disastrously-received NC-17 cult favorite Showgirls. This time around Verhoeven returns to the genre that has been most kind to him. Starship Troopers is his third science fiction endeavor following in the footsteps of Robocop and Total Recall. And as was true for both of those films Verhoeven applies his own unique style to the material. Much of Starship Troopers is presented tongue-in-cheek and the level of violence and gore (bodies being ripped limb-from-limb and so forth) is so extreme that viewers will quickly become desensitized to it. The story begins sometime in the future on Earth where society has evolved into what producer Jon Davison calls a ""fascist utopia."" Its there in the city of Buenos Aires that we meet Starship Troopers protagonist Johnny Rico played by relative newcomer Casper Van Dien. Rico along with classmates Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards) Carl Jenkins (Neil Patrick Harris TVs Doogie Howser) and Dizzy Flores (Dina Meyer from Dragonheart) is preparing for the future as high school graduation approaches. All four friends are considering joining the Federal Service -- the futuristic equivalent of todays military. Carmen wants to be a pilot Carl wants to enter the intelligence ranks and Rico and Dizzy are headed for the infantry. To add a little spice to their interaction a romantic triangle has developed between Rico Carmen and Dizzy. While the early sequences of Starship Troopers can seem like a prime time soap opera complete with cheesy dialogue and unconvincing character development its clear that Verhoeven knows what hes doing. None of this is played completely straight; at times Starship Troopers first half-hour treads a line between overblown melodrama and parody. Plus there are the Robocop-like propaganda ""news breaks"" that are used to provide expository material and advance the narrative. Although none of the characters are fleshed out much beyond the comic book level we nevertheless find our sympathies aligning with them. The largely no-name cast is not heavy on dramatic acting ability but everyone is appealing and enthusiastic. The stars of Starship Troopers especially Van Dien and Dina Meyer manage to maintain a certain level of human interest in a film that eventually becomes special effects-driven. Following the high school portion of the film the setting shifts to the infantry military school where Rico and Dizzy suffer through basic training under the tutelage of a hard-nosed instructor (Clancy Brown). Weve seen this stuff many times before most recently in G.I. Jane. The most memorable sequence of this segment is a co-ed shower scene designed to remind us that Verhoeven has no compunction about displaying the naked human body even in a science fiction epic. Eventually we get to the action. Humanity is at war with a race of lethal bugs who hail from the planet Klandathu located halfway across the galaxy. They nuke an Earth city and mankind retaliates by launching an invasion of their homeworld. Rico and Dizzy are members of the invading army and Carmen pilots the ship taking them there but the campaign turns into a debacle. The death toll is phenomenal and the enemy scores a clear victory. The war however is just beginning. If viewers are going to gripe about any aspect of Starship Troopers their complaints will be registered against the first half of the film not the second. Once the war starts theres hardly any time for relaxation. Verhoeven orchestrates the battles between CGI aliens and human actors with consummate skill creating extended sequences that crackle with tension and excitement. Starship Troopers is essentially an old-fashioned war movie in a science fiction setting and the film makers adhere to many of the conceits of that genre. The humans are good and the bugs are bad and theres little room for sentimentality amidst all the machismo. John Wayne would have felt very much at home. Technically Starship Troopers is a mixed bag. Some of the scenes such as an endless wave of spider-like aliens swarming across a rocky desertscape or a crippled spaceship breaking in half involve impressive displays of motion picture magic. On other occasions however the effects work looks fake. Perhaps weve gotten to the point where we expect such precision and perfection from special effects that anything less is immediately noticeable. In the final analysis Starship Troopers is flawed but fun and if marketed correctly will likely make a healthy profit (although it will be interesting to see how the ""R"" rating affects its ultimate box-office performance). And while the outline of Heinleins story and many of the characters remain intact only echoes of the rich and controversial political subtext have survived. If you want content read the book. If you want a skillfully-directed fast-paced ride through space and into war see the movie. In a year when so many blockbusters have disappointed Starship Troopers ranks as one of the better examples of lightweight big budget entertainment.

With Casper Van Dien Dina Meyer Denise Richards Neil Patrick Harris. Directed by Paul Verhoeven. (R. 129 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Audiences are going to swarm to ""Starship Troopers"" like insane ants on a gloppy piece of honey-soaked French toast. Paul Verhoevens storm- troopers-with-a-heart extravaganza manages to be both fun and shocking -- sometimes in the same shot. Looks are everything in this exhilarating sci-fi adventure which opens everywhere today. On one side are the human beings of the distant future. The men are square- jawed and resolute the women hourglass-figured and resolute and everyones teeth are as blindingly white as those of comic strip heroes. Then there are the bugs -- icky insects the size of automobiles stretching their tentacles across the galaxy. Ambitious and slimy the bugs are sending out asteroids from their own bug planet trying to wipe out humanity and extend their empire. Its interesting that the bugs existence is never explained or for a moment doubted. They are simply out there as a malevolent force. (""If you find a bug hole nuke it"") The films special effects are astonishing but the most notable and unexpected thing about ""Starship Troopers"" is its tone. Most sci-fi films give the future a bleached-out look and depict it as cold and mechanistic. Even the movies we remem ber as brisk and peppy (the ""Star Wars"" trilogy) often have an austere aura. But Verhoeven (""Basic Instinct"" ""Total Recall"" ""Showgirls"") was wise to remember that hundreds of years from now there will still be youth smiles and gung-ho enthusiasm. The film based on the novel by Robert A. Heinlein shows an Earth governed by a militarist technologically advanced federation. Information is dispersed through newsreel-like personal-computer announcements that present even the worst news in a lively fast-paced style. In the future a government that wishes to rule must first entertain. These computer newsreels interspersed throughout the film provide a sardonic running commentary. More interesting they say something about the people of this future time. The unabashed jingoism of the announcer reminiscent of the anti-Communist newsreels of the 1950s suggests a populace thats happy gullible and unquestioningly patriotic. ""Starship Troopers"" begins like a comic-strip version of a recruiting film. It almost has the form of a World War II propaganda movie that follows raw recruits through basic training into battle -- but with a difference. In 40s war movies no one ever got his brains sucked out by a big bug. There are no stars. Neil Patrick Harris (TVs ""Doogie Howser"") is probably the only familiar name. The cast of impossibly good-looking unknowns is headed by Casper Van Dien who plays Johnny Rico a rich kid from Buenos Aires. (Buenos Aires might just as well be New Jersey. National differences have disappeared.) Johnnys glamorous girlfriend Carmen (Denise Richards) plans to become a pilot so Johnny joins the infantry to impress her. Gradually casually the customs and beliefs of this future society are revealed things like racial and gender equality and male-female showers. Likewise the emotional side of Johnnys world emerges the nice spunky girl who has loved him since high school (Dina Meyer) the stern instructor (Michael Ironside) who becomes a father-figure battle leader. The details are simple but count for something later when the bugs start indiscriminately slicing off peoples appendages. The carnage keeps the R-rated ""Starship Troopers"" from being a film for small children or the squeamish. Icky dissections are one thing and green bug gook splattering the faces of soldiers is all well and good. But mangled corpses severed body parts heads with suck holes in them and people being burned alive have a way of disturbing more sensitive viewers. These bugs are bad news -- huge and crablike with razor-sharp legs. They can leap they can bite they can slice they can dice. They are like food processors but nasty. Troopers from Earth check into the bug planet but they dont check out. As ""Starship Troopers"" becomes essentially a war picture it loses some of its fascination. But it remains unique. Theres an amazing sequence in which a swarm of creepy crawlers and flying insects besieges the troopers fortress. When the good guys look out over the rim and see a sea of bugs converging the scene seems as real as the siege of the Alamo only scarier. The picture seems to depict a future in which weapons technology has not kept pace with other scientific advances. Our heroes can fly to distant ends of the galaxy but when it comes to fighting the bugs the soldiers are left with conventional air strikes tactical nukes and puny machine guns. What about chemical weapons -- you know Raid Black Flag? What about flypaper?

They come in a variety of species -- there are beautiful big dragonflies as well as the occasional three-block-long fire-breathing ant beast -- but the main threat are the Arachnids 15-foot-tall spider/ scorpion hybrids with razory spiked legs that can poke through your chest before youve had a chance to say ""Damn"" Those talons attack like lightning and so do the Arachnids; they skitter forward as if jet-propelled. The only way to destroy one short of landing a machine-gun blast at its nerve center is to shoot off every last one of its twitching legs something youve got about five seconds to do -- Blam Blam Blam Blam -- before the bug is in your face. Assuming you succeed you can turn your attention to the several hundred more Arachnids that are following in its path coming at you with the same zip-speed primitive-brained relentlessness. Starship Troopers is as relentless as those bugs. Directed by Paul ""Tomorrows Blockbuster Belongs to Me"" Verhoeven who returns here to the nihilistic shock-comix mode of RoboCop and Total Recall the picture is like Aliens Star Wars Top Gun and Jurassic Park all jammed together the whole concoction slathered with a gob of Verhoevens smirking Euro-sadist perversity (leering jokes about lost limbs much sexualized insect imagery). Some of the future-world satire is quite witty. When Verhoeven indulges his knack for exaggerating the worst trends in corporate media culture staging TV news shows that are like nightly flashes of Armageddon the picture achieves some of the spoofy bite of RoboCop (his best film). Mostly though what Starship Troopers feels like is a hyperactive death-sport videogame. This monster-combat epic is bloody amoral and -- I wont deny it -- sensationally exciting. Few will mistake it for a pop classic but once the soldiers face off against the bugs which have been brought to life with dazzling new levels of computer-animated wizardry the rhythms of the thrills are scary and addictive. The movie turns its audience into vicarious Terminators. Maybe thats why theres something a little disturbing about the prospect of Americas kids lining up to see Starship Troopers (assuming of course that they can duck into the multiplex doors despite an R rating). Kicky and soulless and violent as hell the movie practically makes a fetish of its own insensitivity. Theres a kinky-camp ghoulishess to it and that ghoulishness extends to the hey-kids-lets-put-on-a-war story line which plays like Beverly Hills 90210 recast as a military-recruitment film for the Third Reich. Verhoeven has populated the movie almost entirely with third-tier Aaron Spelling castoffs -- actors in other words who make Jason Priestley and Heather Locklear look like classical thespians. The blandness of this mannequin troupe is double-edged. We can hardly have much investment in the junior armed-forces soap opera plot -- e.g. will dreamboat enlistee Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien from 90210) win back the hand of aspiring starship pilot Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards from 90210 and Melrose Place)? Will Carmen fall under the spell of her dashing trainer Zander Barcalow (Patrick Muldoon from Melrose)? Can Johnny resist the advances of tough babe Dizzy Flores (Dina Meyer from 90210)? At the same time the teen-dream plasticity of the characters makes them seem ""idealized"" prototypes of a robo-Teutonic future -- and not so incidentally of a movie future in which sensation is all and people are just pretty props. That may be Verhoevens ultimate joke. With Starship Troopers hes trashing movies even as he makes a brazenly entertaining one. Star Wars at the time also seemed a live-action videogame but one with a touch of wonder a glimmer of soul. Starship Troopers by contrast reduces everything it shows you to a disreputable zap. Like Star Wars though it could become ground zero for a new generation of thrill junkies. The first generation perhaps that wont need or even desire movie stars.
