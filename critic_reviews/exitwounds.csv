"USATODAY.com - 15 Minutes is 2 hours too long Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 03/08/2001 - Updated 0746 PM ET 15 Minutes is 2 hours too long By Mike Clark USA TODAY 15 Minutes (out of four) Stars Robert De Niro Edward Burns Kelsey Grammer Avery Brooks Melina Kanakaredes Director John Herzfeld Distributor New Line Rating R for strong violence language and some sexuality Beyond being a clumsy urban thriller the long-delayed 15 Minutes fancies itself an issues picture. Its message Tabloid TV and its attendant hype have gotten so out of hand that the medium has become bigger than the events the shows cover. Now thats a revelation. Stop the presses Or better yet get the theater manager to stop the projector. A cant-be-divulged plot twist destroys what little enjoyment there is which is too bad because Minutes does have a fairly original hook the combination of a substandard cop pic with a melodrama about fires. Read more Stories A new wrinkle in getting a movie role 15 Minutes is 2 hours too long Movies and TV take satirical aim at reality shows Video USA TODAYs Mike Clark Dont make time for 15 Minutes Though the concept is mostly wasted its the excuse for teaming a New York homicide detective (Robert De Niro) with a young arson investigator (Edward Burns). For a while we know something they dont The murderers who have torched a building to disguise their crime are a pair of Eastern European nut cases. And one of them is a movie enthusiast who uses a camcorder to document additional killings. A subsidiary figure in all this -- though the film has to keep nudging itself to give him screen time -- is a tabloid-show host played by Kelsey Grammer. Portrayed as someone with practically the clout of Walter Winchell in his prime he has recently been in the process of turning De Niros character into a media star. The detective is beginning to think his newfound celebrity may be a mixed blessing but doesnt know the half of it. He will. Meanwhile the rampaging killers are so brazen about not covering their tracks that even Barney Fife would need just five minutes to have them cuffed and on their knees listening to their Miranda rights. Instead writer/director John Herzfeld has to stretch the story to the two-hour mark so he can continue fashioning his tired polemic. The Minutes press release calls the movie ""smart"" but its less brainy than even 1997s press-bashing Mad City the Dustin Hoffman-John Travolta pic that watered down the anti-media points made so forcefully in Billy Wilders 1951 Ace in the Hole. If this means the torch is getting passed its moviegoers who are getting burned.

Posted April 6 2001 -- 1200 AM EDT Whoever coordinated Steven Seagals ""new look"" should have paid more attention to his hairline That wedge is starting to resemble brown velour thats been put through the washing machine. Seagal shows his age in Exit Wounds but he also exhibits the surly charisma that made him a sort-of star. This blithely brutal cops-and-drugs thriller is an efficient hot-wire entertainment.

Starring Steven Seagal and DMX. Directed by Andrzej Bartkowiak. (R. 91 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In spite of what 30 extra pounds and an overworked stunt double seem to indicate Steven Seagal 2001 is not on his way to a ""Walker Texas Ranger"" of his own. Dang it hes still a die-hard and now with a vengeance. Director Andrzej Bartkowiak has even politely cut his ""Exit Wounds"" so as not to catch the 49-year-old reaching for the inhaler. Playing a rage-oholic cop Seagal is kept to simple descriptive sentences like ""Im in hell."" His co-star knows the feeling. DMXs second record was called ""Its Dark and Hell Is Hot."" Bartkowiak who also directed DMX in ""Romeo Must Die"" appears to be singlehandedly trying to transform the rapper from dog lover to action god. But for a guy who once bellowed ""Yall gon make me act a fool up in here"" D is profoundly uncharismatic playing a dot-com ""gazillionaire"" with a booming heroin business and a spot on the board of his pals nudie bar. He and Seagal team up to bring down a ring of crooked cops but theres no story here. The film is all about the grisly electric mayhem that ensues when these two guys hit the streets. Watching Seagal survive the impossible -- like when he gets up and fights after a 10-second rendezvous with a stun gun -- is a ridiculous reminder of what hes learned from an aging action peer Hell be back. This film contains raw language and violence.

The ingredients of this bullet-punctuated car-demolishing flame-filled good-cop corrupt-cop tale are about as novel as a lollipop. But for those in search of action-filled escapist entertainment who are willing to jettison expectations of credibility into the nearest popcorn tub Exit Wounds directed by Andrzej Bartkowiak (Romeo Must Die) with a sense of pace and style will do to pass time on an inclement day. After all this is one of those films in which none of the zillion rounds of pistol shotgun and automatic weapon fire unleashed at the hero no matter how dire his straits can do better than hit his bulletproof vest (once); nor is any honest working-stiff patrolman around when the good guys and bad guys begin yet again to demolish Detroit. No honest cop that is except Mr. Seagal as Orin Boyd who nevertheless is regarded by his superiors in the police department in Detroit as an undisciplined anger-prone law-bending lone wolf a maverick to be exiled even after he single-handedly foils a bloody attempt by Michigan militants to assassinate the vice president of the United States. Sent into the trouble-prone 15th precinct the lone wolf speedily sniffs out a plot by some of his supposed colleagues to peddle 5 million in stolen heroin to the cool enigmatic Latrell Walker (DMX) an Internet entrepreneur who has a few surprises for everyone up his tank tops and other cool threads. Isaiah Washington portrays the dedicated officer who becomes Boyds new partner and Tom Arnold as a television talk show host and Anthony Anderson as Walkers sidekick provide comic relief. Jill Hennessy (seen recently on television as Jacqueline Kennedy) plays Boyds no-nonsense new precinct commander who first dispatches him to an anger management class and later melts when he intrudes on her dinner at a slow-food restaurant orders her date to take a hike and chomps on his food. With her eyes with her smile she seems say Who can resist this big lug? In this star vehicle adapted by Ed Horowitz and Richard DOvidio from a John Westermann novel no one can. Exit Wounds is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes coarse language frequent violence and female toplessness. EXIT WOUNDS Directed by Andrzej Bartkowiak; written by Ed Horowitz and Richard DOvidio based on the novel by John Westermann; director of photography Glen MacPherson; edited by Derek G. Brechin; production designer Paul Denham Austerberry; produced by Joel Silver and Dan Cracchiolo; released by Warner Brothers. Running time 100 minutes. This film is rated R. WITH Steven Seagal (Orin Boyd) DMX (Latrell Walker) Isaiah Washington (George) Anthony Anderson (Strutt) Michael Jai White (T. K.) Jill Hennessy (Annette Mulcahy) David Vadim (Montini) Matthew G.

Seeing Steven Seagal in ""Exit Wounds"" his first bigscreen actioner in a few years makes one wonder how he ever managed to be regarded as anything resembling a movie star. Puffy-looking sluggish and resolutely uncharismatic hes shown up for what he is (and isnt) by the younger fitter actors who surround him in this routinely made genre piece thats been carefully designed as a ""comeback"" vehicle. Increasingly familiar Joel Silver mix of an action stalwart with a hip-hop personality heavily ethnic supporting cast and highly promotable soundtrack elements should trigger a solid opening shot followed by a fairly steep slide to acceptable ultimate B.O. The scent of calculation cloaks the enterprise from beginning to end Seagals character is a lone-wolf cop a la Dirty Harry who lives to piss off his superiors; rapper DMX (who had a small role in Silvers similar actioner ""Romeo Must Die"") is given initial street cred by appearing to play a drug-dealing villain before revealing his virtuous true colors in the late going and theres equal opportunity comic relief courtesy of Tom Arnold and Anthony Anderson latter of whom also appeared in ""Romeo"" but made his mark as one of Jim Carreys sons in ""Me Myself amp; Irene."" In the overblown opening action sequence Seagals veteran detective Orin Boyd saves the life of the U.S. vice president from the blistering assault of some renegade cops. Curiously hes demoted for his trouble reassigned to the notorious 15th Precinct and sent to anger-management class where he lasts about five minutes and also meets voluble talkshow host Henry Wayne (Arnold). It doesnt take long to see that Seagal has not spent his layoff getting buff and into fighting trim. In the stars first martial arts display with a bunch of Asian toughs he catches breaking into his car -- and then in every subsequent hand-to-hand combat scene as well -- director Andrzej Bartkowiak (back for more after ""Romeo"") and editor Derek G. Brechin break from the routine style of the rest of the film and resort to some furiously fast cutting to disguise the fact that Seagal isnt actually doing much of anything. Even more of a joke is a sequence in the 15th Precinct locker room which seems to function primarily as a weight-training center for the countrys most muscular cops. On one occasion the various Mr. Universe candidates are competing in a hazing-like game of seeing how long they can take having a stun gun jabbed in their guts. All the other guys are stripped to the waist but not Seagal who gets the treatment through all his clothes; clearly the star wasnt about to be compared to his hunky and much younger supporting cast (although you can bet that Bruce Willis or even Clint Eastwood in his 60s would have done it). Based on a novel by street cop John Westermann inspired by his real-life partner a wild Vietnam vet pic has very little story. Working his way back up from traffic cop under the watchful eye of Mulcahy who only happens to be the most attractive precinct commander youve ever seen thanks to the casting of Jill Hennessy Boyd stumbles upon one tense confrontation after another. Most of these have something to do with a big drug deal going down involving local operator Latrell Walker (DMX) whose brother is languishing in prison and police attempts to bust him. But its soon clear that at least some of the cops are dirty -- its only a question of how many of them -- and eventually that Latrell is involved in a very sophisticated and modern form of entrepreneurial investigation however implausible it may be that reps the only remotely fresh element here. Although the film is rated R most of the violence is ""clean"" or relatively blood-free. But its also very routine and unimaginative with Bartkowiak scaling back from some of his more stylized gambits in ""Romeo"" and none of it -- the shootouts or the martial arts sleight of hand -- showing any special flair. The use of Toronto to stand in for Detroit has resulted in some pretty humorous sights especially when what is supposed to be the worst part of the Michigan city is repped by Torontos somewhat seedy but heavily traveled and immediately recognizable Yonge Street; whats more a huge sign promoting Torontos Sky Dome is plainly visible. If filmmakers are going to continue to double Toronto for American cities theyre going to have to be more adept than this. Viewers who sit through ""Exit Wounds"" should at least do themselves the favor of staying for the end credits which feature some truly funny off-color banter between Anderson and Arnold on the latters ostensible talkshow.
