Yes you guessed it Adam Sandler stars as errant footballer Paul Crewe who winds up behind bars with likeable spiv Chris Rock under the watchful eye of competitive warden James Cromwell. Crewe must form a prisoners football team to take on the guards during whose training tensions are tackled and friendships formed. Like most of Segals comedies the humour is broad the sidekicks one-dimensional and the tone so light its hard to take supposedly tragic events seriously. Theres some pleasure to be found in cameos from Burt Reynolds (star of the original film) and Courtney Cox (as Crewes alarmingly large-chested partner in the films opening scene) plenty of sports action and a smattering of laughs but really this has nothing to add to the genre. Its Stateside popularity like Sandlers own may remain a mystery to those on this side of the Atlantic.

"Yard Flag on the Play washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Yard Flag on the Play Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday May 27 2005 THERE IS LIFE on other planets. I know this because the other night I sat in an audience that must have included at least a few alien visitors judging from the scattered applause (applause) that greeted the closing credits of ""The Longest Yard."" (Note that I didnt say it was intelligent life.) I know what youre going to say. A possible explanation for the ovation I witnessed is that it came from people who were too young to have seen the original -- and better -- 1974 movie on which this Adam Sandler and Chris Rock vehicle is based a comedy-drama about a brutal high-stakes football game between prison inmates and sadistic guards. But you dont need to have been around 31 years ago to find this remake the teensiest bit familiar. Heck you just need to have been around some time in the past two weeks since the kiddie soccer comedy ""Kicking amp; Screaming"" has been playing. Thats right. Its the same darn movie and its been made not once before but a thousand times. Take any team of raggedy inept but lovable athletes pit them against a more powerful and unlikable rival bring them within a hairs breadth of losing (one goal one touchdown one basket one run whatever) and then introduce a galvanizing event that will in defiance of all odds -- but in full accordance with the Hollywood playbook -- produce a stunning come-from-behind victory not to mention one of several optional life lessons in the bargain. Teamwork? Honesty? Loyalty? Faith? Take your pick. Oops. Have I spoiled anything? Well maybe for the extraterrestrials among us who apparently are the only ones who dont seem to know that the good guys especially when they are underdogs in sports movies always win. (Okay so they didnt in ""Friday Night Lights."" Different kind of sports movie by which I mean vastly superior.) This is not to say that I didnt enjoy this retooling of ""The Longest Yard."" Sandler who plays washed-up NFL quarterback Paul ""Wrecking"" Crewe in prison for violating parole after shaving points during a pro game and Rock as his jailhouse sidekick make an appealing pair of wiseacres. Each comedians specialty -- in Rocks case rapid-fire sardonic wit in Sandlers a sort of smirking slacker humor -- is given ample room to run when the two find themselves forced by the corrupt warden (James Cromwell) to prep a team of bumbling inmates each of whom provides comic fodder for a mismatched tuneup game against the wardens crack squad of brutal guards. But the pleasure is entirely like eating cake made from cake mix. Its not like you dont know how its going to turn out or how it tasted the last time you ate it. The addition of Burt Reynolds who played Crewe in the 74 film and here plays an imprisoned former Heisman Trophy winner is nevertheless a nicely knowing homage. Everyone knows or ought to know whether the ball is ultimately going to fall on the near or the far side of the goal line. It is however the arc of the pass that makes all the difference. As is to be expected in any movie where Sandler is the executive producer the vast preponderance of the jokes have to do with making fun of gays mental defectives randy old women and southerners and getting hit in the crotch but theyre delivered with such good will by the movies genial stars that even a jaded movie critic was able to share a laugh or two with the brothers from another planet who had never heard them before.

"Longest Yard A Two-Bit Quarterback washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Longest Yard A Two-Bit Quarterback Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday May 27 2005 It has gotten to the point that with Hollywoods trend of cannibalizing everything from its most beloved classics to its most forgettable mediocrities a movie critic these days isnt reviewing one movie but two. Not only is the film at hand to be evaluated but it also must be compared and contrasted with the original movie which inevitably the new director has butchered/bowdlerized/maimed or -- hey it can happen -- improved. To this critics shame and chagrin she was unable to see the 1974 version of ""The Longest Yard"" an acknowledged period classic starring Burt Reynolds in one of his best-loved roles a cocky convict who leads a ragtag team of fellow inmates against their guards in a (forgive the pun) take-no-prisoners football game. So this review will perforce dispense with the lining up of ledgers noting what scenes have been deleted or added what themes emphasized or not what characters filled out or erased. But it can safely be stated even without having seen the original that Adam Sandler is no Burt Reynolds. And the fact that ""The Longest Yard"" has turned into an Adam Sandler comedy pretty much tells you everything you need to know about ""The Longest Yard"" circa 2005. Rather than the adult comedy Reynolds starred in 30 years ago this one is clearly directed at teenagers who will no doubt gobble up the hard-core athletics and the sophomoric sexual humor. Admittedly the football action is bone-crunchingly visceral but it doesnt really kick in until the last half-hour or so of a movie that spends much more time on getting Sandlers character into jail and establishing just how ruthless the prison guards are. Thats bone-crunchingly visceral too but that doesnt mean its any fun. Sandler plays Paul ""Wrecking"" Crewe a former pro football player who was banned from the sport for throwing a game several years ago. When hes nicked for drunken driving hes sent to prison and through the machinations of an ambitious warden (James Cromwell) he winds up in a Texas penitentiary where the only thing they like better than electrocuting people is playing football. Crewe is roped into organizing a tune-up game against the guards who are to a man nasty brutish and steroid-enhanced; like so many World War II adventures of yore Crewes motley bunch is composed of one-of-each by way of Central Casting the fast-talking weakling the big dumb lug and the wisecracking best buddy whos always there in a pinch. That last one thankfully is played by Chris Rock who dials back his usual flashing-eyed mania to deliver the movies only truly appealing performance. In addition to providing much-needed warmth in an otherwise soulless production hes responsible for some surprisingly honest throwaway lines having to do with race all the more welcome in a film that uncritically perpetuates the idea that the team can win only when the brothers sign on. (In another unfortunate case of stereotyping that big dumb lug is an African American man who here is portrayed as a sweetly naive noble savage like the hero in ""The Green Mile"" combined with William ""The Refrigerator"" Perry.) But dont think for a minute that ""The Longest Yard"" is about anything other than Sandler and his ego; this is an all-out vanity production from the loving slow-motion shots of Our Hero decked out in flattering shoulder pads and mud-splattered jerseys to a cameo appearance late in the movie of his equally irritating sidekick Rob Schneider. Reynolds shows up for a cameo too but what should be an affectionate respectful grace note somehow is distorted into the painful sight of an aging star literally stuffing himself into a role he has long since outgrown. Whether its the sight of Reynolds squeezed painfully into a football uniform or the endless footballs-to-the-crotch and tired gay jokes ""The Longest Yard"" has the feeling of mutton dressed as lamb. The Longest Yard (114 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for crude and sexual humor violence profanity and drug use.

Browse over 8 million products  Clothing amp; Jewelry  Computers amp; Electronics  Home amp; Garden  Kids amp; Family Longest Yard scores bigBy Mike Clark USA TODAY Adam Sandler may be quarterbacking in the remake of The Longest Yard but hes still the guy going out for the long one. Here he is co-opting one of Burt Reynolds signature roles when Reynolds himself has been recruited for the supporting cast -- then scoring as Burts raised eyebrow is probably peering over his shoulderpads. The fix is in Burt Reynolds and Adam Sandler go on the offensive against the guards. Paramount Pictures And thats not all. Though theres no drearier trend in current movies than recycling this modified Yard is more smoothly crafted than the 1974 slapstick version. The core play remains Hardened convicts engage in a dirty football contest against tormenting guards. All thats missing is the rah-rah anti-authoritarian sentiment even the mass audience felt the year Richard Nixon resigned. Any tweaks are almost all for the better including Chris Rock serving up wisecracks as Sandlers sidekick Reynolds sentimental casting as a coaching assistant prison gays cheerleading in drag. Then theres the tightening; this version is 10 minutes shorter and you feel it. About the movie The Longest Yard    (out of four) Stars Adam Sandler Chris Rock Burt Reynolds James Cromwell Courtney Cox Arquette Director Peter Segal Distributor Paramount Running time 1 hour 53 minutes Rated PG-13 for crude and sexual humor violence language and drug references Opens Friday nationwide As before Sandlers has-been quarterback long banned from the pros for shaving points ends up in a Texas prison for wrecking his girlfriends car in a boozy police chase. An unbilled Courteney Cox plays this shrew-with-good-reason wearing a dress that will earn her an array of new friends. Yard-74 lore has it that director Robert Aldrich (The Dirty Dozen) asked the great Eddie Albert to play the warden role ""as"" Nixon. Here a logically cast James Cromwell is just another martinet with gubernatorial ambitions. Like Albert Cromwell uses ""methods"" to coerce his reluctant superstar into coaching the cons in a practice game against his semi-pro team of prison guards. What ensues is so brass-knuckles nasty that even the audience might feel like wearing a cup. Rock and Reynolds take over team staff roles once respectively played by Jim Hampton and Michael Conrad capable actors but lacking the audience goodwill their star replacements have earned. And instead of Bernadette Peters as the wardens assistant (she was 26 and looked older) the role goes to Cloris Leachman (now 79 and a thus more wicked bet for a quarterback quickie even though you wouldnt guess her age). Both then and now Tracy Keenan Wynns screenplay is a pure crock -- though it has such a natural hook that you sense both sets of studio honchos must have started counting their money when watching the daily rushes. And though The Longest Yard isnt very deep neither is it any long ordeal at the multiplex. The new version has the zip of a 96-yard punt return and all the ingredients to inspire the celebratory crushing of empty beer cans.

Then again its a remake of the movie that started it all. 1 / 2 Back to Gallery The Longest Yard Comedy. Starring Adam Sandler Burt Reynolds and Chris Rock. Directed by Peter Segal. (PG-13. 122 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""The Longest Yard"" is no classic but neither was the original starring Burt Reynolds. Instead its an odd mix of amusing nonsense and nastiness that chugs along hit and miss until the last section which is the best part of the movie and its real reason for being the game. Its an honest remake of the original ""The Longest Yard"" (1974) in contrast with all the disguised remakes that have popped up in the intervening decades. Before ""The Longest Yard"" there had been other sports movies but ""LY"" was the first to show that the depiction of a game could serve not just as a movies climax but as a lengthy act in itself -- that audiences would gladly sit and watch a fictional game just as theyd watch a real game on television with the same focus and concentration. Sports movies have capitalized on that discovery ever since. Adam Sandler not acting like an obnoxious child this time out plays it straight as Crewe a former NFL quarterback fallen on hard times. A spectacular drunken driving episode leads to his imprisonment in a maximum security prison where they have everything but attack dogs and chain gangs. They do have guards with big hats and Southern accents who establish within minutes that theres no justice to be had on the inside. They start beating on him right away just for fun. Sandler must be doing something right in ""The Longest Yard"" because the sight of his getting pummeled by prison guards actually provokes a sympathetic response and not the gleeful satisfaction one might reasonably expect. James Cromwell plays the warden who has brought Crewe to his prison for a reason. He has a football team made up of prison guards and he wants to win the state championship. Impressed into service Crewe suggests the guards limber up with an exhibition game; consequently the warden orders Crewe to create a team from among the prison population. Thats the setup and the rest of the screenplay you can probably go off now and write without even consulting the original. If it wasnt formula in 1974 it sure is formula today the team of eccentrics the disastrous training sessions the emerging promise etc. The movie comes close to dragging about a third of the way in losing velocity as it repeats the same kind of scene over and over of Crewe going around trying to recruit big or fast guys onto the team. His rationale is always the same Playing the guards presents a legal pretext for stomping on the guards. But the movie stays alive though sometimes barely floating along on the steady patter of decent bits and the reliable presence of both Chris Rock who can be funny just standing there and Reynolds whos just nice to see. Reynolds and Rock play Crewes fellow prisoners Rock the trainer and Reynolds the coach. Also good for a few chuckles is Cloris Leachman in her ""Young Frankenstein"" mode as a lust-ridden grotesque who takes a romantic interest in Sandler. Finally if you make it two-thirds of the way in the game starts and the game is pretty much a blast. -- Advisory Crude humor and sexual situations.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post In ""The Waterboy"" Adam Sandler played a moron in a football movie who was surrounded by smart guys and they communicated across the IQ gap by calling each other names. In ""The Longest Yard"" remake Sandler plays a smart guy in a football movie who is surrounded by morons and they communicate across genetic limitations by calling each other names. The main difference between the two determinedly mediocre Sandler comedies is the cheerleaders. In ""The Waterboy"" the cheerleaders were buxom girls in short skirts. In ""The Longest Yard"" the cheerleaders are also buxom but they wear shorter skirts. And they happen to be male. ""The Longest Yard"" is hard to describe as anything but a football-and-prison-themed revue by really buff drag queens. The movies play clock never runs out before the bad boys loft downfield another gay joke or homophobic reply. The only thing missing is Beavis and Butt-head in the announcer booth snickering ""Heh heh He said tight end"" ""The Longest Yard"" is also the kind of movie where former Bronco linebacker Bill Romanowski tries to deflect memories of his vicious spitting cheap shots by launching an acting career as an abusive prison guard who makes vicious spitting cheap shots. Make sense of that one and it may be your comedy of the year. The remake of the 1974 anti-establishment classic starts out with promise shades of a comic-cool ""Starsky amp; Hutch"" for 2005. Sandler is a washed-up former NFL quarterback accused of throwing a game for gamblers. He steals trophy girlfriend Courtney Coxs car and gets arrested after a televised chase then is sent to a prison where the football-obsessed warden (James Cromwell) had him transferred. A guards-vs.-inmates football game is inevitable though there is usually some pleasure in watching a predictable plot fall neatly into place. Its a nearly shot-for-shot redo of the Burt Reynolds movie only more juvenile. Reynolds brought a jaded sexiness to his roles perfect for a smart-aleck prison rebel. Sandler brings mostly tired petulance and hes too small to play an NFL MVP with any credibility. Surrounded by real NFL players in cameos Sandler makes Doug Flutie look like Manute Bol. Chris Rock as sidekick ""Caretaker"" is the best thing in an otherwise forgettable movie. As he showed at the Academy Awards Rock is constitutionally unfit to play anything but a rebel against whatever status quo hes dropped into - even if its a movie set. If the script is thin and the jokes tired Rock can make us laugh by widening his eyes to say ""I didnt have anything to do with this whack vanilla retread."" ""The Longest Yard"" is not a movie you can quote outside a nightclub act. How the movie avoided an R rating is more interesting than the movie. We cant mention what words the cheerleaders spell out. We cant mention any of their poses. Can we mention a key plot point involves changing a guards steroid pills to estrogen? Lets just say this movie explores all the homoerotic mythology of the gridiron and the cellblock without remotely dispelling any images of those fairy (sorry) tales. Reynolds suffers recidivism to reappear for the remake as an aging inmate who won the Heisman Trophy for USC. Apparently sometime during the Punic Wars. Reynolds looks more resigned than grateful though they give him some glory in a trick play about as convincing as an ""Air Bud"" movie. I realize this all sounds as if I hated the movie. But I didnt. Its one of those almost-funny comedies that is often pleasant to sit through and nearly impossible to seriously recommend. See it if you think Adam Sandler is Joe Montana. See it if you like men in team-issued tight pants. See it if you like men in prison-issue tight pants. See it if you have lots of extra time on your hands. Say 10 to 20.

Before starring in the remake Adam Sandler was . . . the Waterboy. Spectacular miscasting is the least of the problems with this tale of a football game between prison guards and inmates which also features Reynolds himself in a frustratingly wasted appearance as a coach; Chris Rock who hangs around dealing predictable wisecracks; and the rapper Nelly. There probably are a lot of talented sportsmen in prison just as in sports there are a lot of criminals one of whom shows up here in a promising cameo Michael Irvin the former Dallas Cowboys receiver who turned up 65 times in the end zone but even more frequently beneath a pile of strippers and cocaine. Like Nelly he could probably do a lot more than the script gives him. Lets give a pass on the absurd premise. (Why would guards play football with cons? Do hunters give rifles to ducks?) But the power of prison movies is that the stakes are so high the desperation so palpable. In this one when former NFL MVP quarterback Paul ""Wrecking"" Crewe (Sandler) leads police on a drunken vehicular melee and earns a three-year stretch Allenville Federal Prison turns out to be after some introductory beatings a big fun college dorm. Inmates wander freely into each others cells sip top-shelf cocktails eat glorious meals and spend almost no time locked up. Crewe who as played by Sandler is less the rough antihero of 70s film than an arrogant jerk is arrested in San Diego but nevertheless sent to a federal prison in Texas so the actors can try out their hick accents. (Crewe had already been on probation because he may or may not have thrown a pro football game; the charge was never proven. Screenwriter Sheldon Turner seems to think that when you are charged with a crime but not convicted you get probation as a compromise.) ""The Waterboy"" was funny because Sandler doesnt look like a football player. When he swaggers around ""The Longest Yard"" starting fights and taking beatings without flinching he only reminds us how little Steve McQueen and how much Woody Allen there is in him. Hes so tiny that James Cromwell who towers above him as the evil warden looks like he could kick his butt. A lot of effort went into one of the most annoyingly obtrusive product placements in memory for a fast food purveyor but the characters sound like they were dreamed up during the drive to the set. The prison guards? Racists. (In case you miss the point their dress uniforms look like the latest from Joseph Goebbels spring collection). One personality tic is carefully rationed to each inmate then turned into a running gag that quickly becomes the movie equivalent of a bread and water diet. A really big guys joke is that he talks like a baby. Anothers is that he has a foreign accent. And for maximum hilarity the gay prisoners keep popping up in halter tops to do the same limp-wristed sissy act over and over. A joke about whether a player has lost bowel control not exactly Oscar Wilde-level wit to begin with is repeated about six times. The prisons security which at the climactic game allows fans to depart through a single unguarded fence is noticeably looser than it was at the advance screening where huge guys looking to bust video pirates treated me to a full-body search and nearly shook me down for my lunch money before entry was granted.

Sandler impressively assumes the Reynolds role here with strong support by Reynolds himself and a slightly restrained but frequently hilarious Chris Rock. This mass-appeal crowd-pleaser is poised to score sturdy numbers during its opening weekend kick-off. Play-off should be leggy and followed by huge post-season vid numbers.</b> Its way too early for comparisons to Jack Lemmon and Billy Wilder or even to Jerry Lewis and Frank Tashlin but Adam Sandler and helmer Peter Segal can boast yet another solidly commercial collaboration ""The Longest Yard"" a shrewdly updated yet surprisingly faithful remake of Robert Aldrichs 1974 football-behind-bars dramedy starring Burt Reynolds. Sandler impressively assumes the Reynolds role here with strong support by Reynolds himself and a slightly restrained but frequently hilarious Chris Rock. This mass-appeal crowd-pleaser is poised to score sturdy numbers during its opening weekend kick-off. Play-off should be leggy and followed by huge post-season vid numbers. The second reprise of an Aldrich pic to hit screens in recent months following underrated and under-performing ""Flight of the Phoenix"" ""Longest Yard"" rarely strays far from the original playbook scripted by Tracy Keenan Wynn (from a story by producer Albert S. Ruddy who returns as an exec producer for the remake). Revised screenplay credited to Sheldon Turner -- and possibly enhanced by ad-libs from Sandler Rock and others -- allows more room for broader comedy whichlets Sandler and Segal (reunited after ""Anger Management"" and ""50 First Dates"") play to their strengths. But rough-and-tumble of climactic gridiron match-up between prisoners and guards is scarcely less violent here than in the R-rated original. Only the language appears to have been sanitized (Rock lobs only a single F-bomb) to obtain a PG-13 rating. Disgraced former NFL quarterback Paul ""Wrecking"" Crewe (Sandler) rebels against his role as boy-toy for a rich bitch (played fleetingly but shrewishly by an unbilled Courteney Cox Arquette) by drunkenly joyriding in her expensive sports car. Violating terms of an earlier five-year probation for his role in a point-shaving scheme Crewe winds up in a Texas federal penitentiary. Warden Hazen (James Cromwell) a football fanatic with political ambitions wants Crewe to help coach his semi-pro team of prison guards. But Captain Knauer (William Fichtner) the turf-conscious player-coach of the guards makes it known he doesnt want Crewes help. Out among the prison population Crewe gets an even frostier reception. Caretaker (Rock) a wheeler-dealer convict who befriends the otherwise friendless newcomer explains The convicts will forgive rape murder grand theft auto or writing bad checks but shaving points in a football game crosses the line. Its ""un-American"" Caretaker says. With a little help from grizzled sage Nate Scarborough (Reynolds) another NFL veteran doing hard time Crewe recruits a team of inmates for a practice game against the guards. Joining up are Deacon Moss (former Dallas Cowboy Michael Irvin) Brucie (Nicholas Turturro) and Torres (Lobo Sebastian). Rapper Nelly and pro wrestler Bill Goldberg also figure prominently on a team that defies the odds during the climactic brutally funny half-hour grudge match. As in the original for Crewe the game is a shot at redemption. For his players its a chance to take a shot at the guards. In its time the original ""Yard"" was viewed by many as an ersatz companion piece to Aldrichs 1967 ""The Dirty Dozen"" underscoring similarities between criminal behavior and socially sanctioned violence. Segals ""Yard"" doesnt place much emphasis on subtext although it makes some sharp satirical points by having the game attract national TV attention and several real-life sports commentators. (ESPN gets cable broadcast rights.) New versions final game though sufficiently brutal gets a lot more laughs than the earlier edition. Indeed the remake as whole arguably is a slight improvement over the original given its somewhat more disciplined tonal consistency. Still new pic is so faithful to its source that one major second-act plot development may be genuinely shocking to contemporary viewers (even those who have seen the original). The final scene effectively reprises the finish of the original right down to certain camera angles with one novel twist a quick cutaway to reaction shot of smiling Burt Reynolds who appears in context to be granting his blessing to entire project. Sandler smartly balances the scripts mix of cynicism and sentiment in his ingratiating lead performance. (And hes physically persuasive as an ex-quarterback.) Reynolds subtlety is a nifty balance to Rocks sarcasm. Cromwell provides an effective menacing counterbalance as the all-powerful warden. Fichtner Turturro Tracy Morgan (as a saucy transvestite) Cloris Leachman (as a batty horny secretary) and David Patrick Kelly (as a creepy squealer) are stand-outs among the supporting cast. Irvin effortlessly exudes natural screen presence -- as does sportscaster Jim Rome in a cameo. Look for Ed Lauter (the player-coach in 74 ""Yard"") in a wink-wink walk-on bit. Slick tech package includes Dean Semlers ace lensing at the defunct Santa Fe State Penitentiary. Soundtrack includes many familiar pop standards including the Hollies ""Long Cool Woman (in a Black Dress)"" (cleverly employed for the training sequence). In a 2001 remake of the same material footballer-turned-actor Vinnie Jones played an imprisoned ex-soccer star who leads convicts against guards in Barry Skolnicks ""Mean Machine.""
