I can hardly wait for the inevitable reappearances of The Breakfast Club Rain Man and Escape From New York. (Oh wait that last one is actually happening proving once again that commerce outstrips comedy.)Lets start with the good news The new RoboCop takes place in 2028 and The Atlantic is still in businessRelated Story True Detective The Best Show on TV We know this because early in the movie a conservative talk show host (Samuel L. Jackson) flashes the magazines cover onscreen to illustrate a controversy coursing through the body politic whether or not America should amend its laws to allow robots to patrol the streets as law enforcement. Theyre already performing this function after all on peacekeeping missions in locales such as Tehran--and what U.S. city wouldnt want to adopt that civic utopia as a model?Public opinion is resistant however. The American people want to ensure that whoever wields the power of life and death has a ""conscience."" So Omni Corp the manufacturer of the cybernetic patrolmen comes up with a compromise. As CEO Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton) declares ""Were gonna put a man""--or least the crucial parts of one--""into a machine."" After incorruptible Detroit cop Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) gets himself blown to pieces in the line of duty Sellars has himself the makings of a Robocop.The only problem is that all-important ""conscience""--or more accurately consciousness--tends to slow down the law-enforcing. Where Omni Corps robots can take out a bad guy in milliseconds Murphys impulse to think first and shoot later is messing with his performance. And so at Sellarss behest Omni Corp doctor Dennet Norton (Gary Oldman) starts screwing around (literally) in Murphys head. The result is a cyborg that responds autonomously to combat situations with Murphys consciousness merely following along for the ride--an illusion of selfhood. (Somewhere Rust Cohle is laughing.) Theres little joy or wit on display and the longer the film progresses the harder it becomes to shake the sense that everyone is merely going through the motions.Its an intriguing conceit though RoboCop doesnt get much mileage out of it. There are other glimmers of ingenuity scattered throughout the movie as well and the cast (which also features Abbie Cornish Jackie Earle Haley Jennifer Ehle Michael K. Williams and Jay Baruchel) is unexpectedly top-shelf. But there are plenty of missteps too--including a couple of the most risibly ill-timed medical interventions ever committed to celluloid--and the pieces never cohere into a satisfying whole.As a general rule a not-exactly-clamored-for remake such as this one needs some powerful animating vision a writer or director who wants to claim authorship and make the material his own. (An earlier iteration of the project was attached to Darren Aronofsky--now that might have been interesting.) Instead RoboCop has the feel of cinema by committee the product of acquisition rather than inspiration. The direction (by Jose Padilha) is competent and as noted the script (by Joshua Zetumer) has its moments. But theres little joy or wit on display and the longer the film progresses the harder it becomes to shake the sense that everyone is merely going through the motions.The original RoboCop was hardly a masterpiece but it was original. Though its relationship to the crime-phobic zeitgeist of the time may have been a bit silly it was at least authentic. The political resonances of the remake by contrast--a half-hearted bid to achieve topicality by connecting the story to U.S. use of drones--is self-evidently contrived. (The fact that drones arent robots and robots arent drones is a problem the film barely even tries to paper over.)Is RoboCop a terrible movie? Not really. By the dubious standards of off-season action remakes its better than most and perhaps an acceptable diversion for those in need. But be forewarned This is a diversion that--like its protagonist--is 100 percent canned.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

After Khizr Khan spoke politicians and commentators on most networks said they were moved humbled inspired choked up.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

As Hurricane Katrina raged through New Orleans in 2005 neighborhood after neighborhood collapsed from flooding. Of the houses that stood many still had to be bulldozed due to mold within the walls. But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon. Continue Reading Channel 4 The Prescience of Brass Eye 15 Years Later David Sims Chris Morriss brutal satire aired its last and most controversial episode in 2001 but its skewering of the news media feels more relevant than ever. A sex offender is thrown in the stocks presented with a small child and asked if he wants to molest him. A mob of protestors is thrown a ""dummy full of guts"" that is stomped to pieces within seconds. A radio host insists that pedophiles have ""more genes in common with crabs"" than the rest of humanity insisting ""Theres no real evidence for [that] but it is scientific fact."" Its hard to pinpoint the most cringe-inducing moment on ""Paedogeddon"" a special episode of the British TV satire Brass Eye. But 15 years after the episode aired it remains a totemic terrifying satirical vision. Few comedies since have dared to cross the boundaries of taste with such impunity. ""Paedogeddon"" aired in the U.K. in the summer of 2001 a year after the murder of a young girl had sparked national hysteria over the countrys sex-offender registry. Britains most-read newspaper led a campaign to publish the names and locations of all 110000 convicted sex offenders prompting a riot in which an angry mob ransacked the home of an ex-con. Brass Eye a parody of a 60 Minutes-like newsmagazine show had been dormant after airing one season in the UK in 1997. But it returned four years later for this surprise broadcast one that saw its furious (fictional) anchors barking from a dark studio about the plague of seemingly super-powered child molesters stalking the nation holding a funhouse mirror up to the climate of paranoia and fear that had built up around the country. It was a bold wildly insensitive piece of comedy but one that captured the growing madness of the 24-hour news media and foreshadowed some uglier aspects of its future.

"(Re)Made for Love << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous The B.S. Report Anthony Davis  Next The Road Not Taken Facebook Twitter Print Movies (Re)Made for Love Hollywoods on the rebound for Valentines Day by Wesley Morris on February 14 2014 Valentines Day is intermittently a big deal to the movie industry. The more aligned February 14 is with a Wednesday or a weekend the crazier it gets. But for every Nicholas Sparks bulls-eye theres something with Adam Sandler Hannibal Lecter or a passel of soon-to-be-dead teens. This year the 14th is a Friday and that means movies are those partners who show they care by totally going overboard. Not only are there a pair of romances and a sex comedy this week but 75 percent of the new major-studio releases are based on movies that already exist. You may love love stories. Hollywood loves remakes. The new RoboCop stars Joel Kinnaman as Alex Murphy a Detroit detective and family man whos killed by crooks and revivified by corporate science. Gary Oldman preserves Murphys brain lungs and long handsome face and builds them an elaborate armor. A slick defense contractor (Michael Keaton) wants to sell the result -- a multibillion-dollar walking tank -- to the government. Theres a liberal moral-minded senator (Zach Grenier) breathing down Keatons neck and Oldmans scientist suspects he might have a Frankenstein situation on his hands. His creation -- RoboCop -- yearns for wife Abbie Cornish and their son while remaining determined to solve his own murder. All this goes on after Iranian insurgents strike back against the U.S. government robot soldiers that roam the streets of Tehran. A quick Google search would have informed our hero that the same thing happened to another guy named Murphy back in 1987. He was shot dead reborn and fought crime and they called that movie RoboCop too. It was a lean mean satire machine that opened 27 years ago in July. The screenwriters Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner wrote a black comedy about Orwellian capitalism and the Dutch director Paul Verhoeven turned it into a strange mockery of Hollywood action priorities. His RoboCop played by Peter Weller embodied and rebuked the law-enforcement avengers of the 70s and the steroidal action figures of the 80s. Verhoeven gave us a literal killing machine. But his film -- with its droll depiction of a complicit media subplot of beat cops on the verge of a strike and myriad flavors of corrupt CEO -- collapsed the future into the present. In 2014 Verhoevens then still feels like now. This remake is like someone breaking into an ATM. It takes less than 20 seconds to find Verhoevens movie which still feels as if it doesnt have a pure genre. This new version directed by Jose Padilha and written by Joshua Zetumer gives it one. Its more of a straight-up action film about a man fighting for his humanity (and against having his dopamine levels manipulated). Thats not nearly as interesting as the anarchic drollery of the original. You miss Verhoevens borderline heartlessness and his inability to tell the difference between good acting and bad (Nancy Allen played Murphys police partner like an 80s sitcom kid sister). That sounds like a put-down but with Verhoeven it just means theres no artifice to the performances. Theres a rawness to everything and the rawness feels real. This new version goes for realness too. This time Michael K. Williams is Murphys partner -- hes the sort of no-frills actor Verhoeven would love. The movie also tries to make a character of Detroit but that doesnt go far. Murphy is engineered in a Chinese factory and exported to the erstwhile Motor City. The irony is cruel and cruelly unexamined. But you never resent it as much as you might want to; the new RoboCop is smart in its limited way. Jennifer Ehle plays an icy corporate lawyer and Jay Baruchel is perfect as Keatons sleazy marketing man. Meanwhile Samuel L. Jackson hosts a hawkish cable-news show in an Al Sharpton perm and the movie grazes todays unique ideological scramble of a liberal presidential administration embracing right-leaning security stances. Happily Padilha is more than a hack. He doesnt fear long shots for one thing. They give RoboCop his due as a physical specimen. In a moment of post-traumatic stress he breaks out of the lab and on to a vast factory floor packed with Chinese workers in pink lab coats then into a rice paddy. The camera trails below him then above. Padilha also gets the movies satire of defense capitalism. When insurgent martyrs strike back against whatever it is the film has the U.S. doing in Tehran the Pentagon cuts the feed to Jacksons news program. This is a thinking action thriller. You laugh at the baldness of a conspiracy whose ladder spans the top of the government down into the Detroit Police Department. Padilha is Brazilian and its interesting that both RoboCops have been made by men whose non-Hollywood work focused on their respective countries curdled politics. Padilha devised the hostage documentary Bus 174 and two Elite Squad action-thrillers and they all deftly asserted that systemic government corruption and neglect of the lower classes breed criminality. Padilhas RoboCop runs on a sentimentality absent from both his other work and Verhoevens original. Murphy just wants to get home to his family and his family needs him to come home to them. But the movie has no idea what to do with the perversity of this new dynamic which seems ripe for a returning-war-veteran allegory. But the movie does something Verhoeven couldnt have in 1987 It loosens up racial and political positions. The liberal anti-drone senator has the humorless doggedness the entertainment industry usually saves for conservatives. And the conservative here is Samuel L. Jackson who more than meets his contractually obligated use of ""motherfucker."" Kinnaman plays pre-RoboCop Murphy in the same black tones he used to play an ex-junkie detective on AMCs The Killing. When Williamss character sees Murphy in ebony armor he says ""Least I know you the right color now."" Which is to say Kinnamans RoboCop gives the action franchise something else thats timely its own Macklemore.  I didnt think of the Endless Love remake as an old Hollywood melodrama. But it is Social mores are breached social mores erupt. Its just never interesting enough to get you thinking about anything. Like the original this version is based on Scott Spencers 1979 novel which was turned into a notorious 1981 Franco Zeffirelli movie with Brooke Shields and Martin Hewitt as two different kinds of rich kids in love. (""She is 15. He is 17"" read the poster. ""The love every parent fears."") Spencers book is a good overblown adult novel that Zeffirelli and screenwriter Judith Rascoe turned into an extra-strength after-school special about sexual obsession. Charmingly Zeffirelli didnt seem to get that he wasnt doing Verdi or Shakespeare but he didnt seem to know he was making a movie either. His direction was unruly and arbitrary two hours of unmowed lawn. But this remake has almost nothing to do with Spencers novel. Its the kind of film you make when youve run out of Nicholas Sparks books. Its set in the South instead of Chicago. The story -- in which a hot working-class kid (Alex Pettyfer) fights for a rich virginal blonde (Gabriella Wilde) -- has Sparks flavoring. There are Secrets. When the boys thrown in jail the girl screams at her father ""Get him out I love him"" The father is played by Bruce Greenwood who tries to make this all seem emotionally plausible as is a good actors wont. But the movie needs him to swap plain old paternity for villainous tiger-dadding -- you know No boys for you daughter just this medical internship. And Why cant you be more like my other son? Whos dead Shana Feste is the director. Shes the one who put the ""try"" in Country Strong -- but that movie at least coughed up a few wonders mostly with the actors. Feste was going for Nashville authenticity there. This time she appears to be aiming for the top of the box office. All of the books bizarre psychological behavior is gone the come-ons the arson the mental illness the sexual assault that downbeat ending. The stars are British models doing American accents and you never believe them. Wilde just spends the movie galloping in and out of rooms. This isnt acting so much as steeplechase. The new movie throws in one friend (Dayo Okeniyi) for comic relief and one (Emma Rigby) for sexual comedy. The latter is a jealous ex -- and brunette -- who at some point finds herself on the edge of a bed with her chest and lips puffed out and stomach sucked in while in the right of the frame Pettyfer stands in the bathroom staring forlornly into a mirror. Thats not a movie scene. Its a Guess Jeans ad. Zeffirelli gave his version heat that you almost never see in movies with young actors now. When Hewitt kissed Shields you were amazed there was anything left of her face. He was hungry for love. Too many actors in the remake just look hungry.  Im no fan of turning one book into 16 movies. But on the way out of Winters Tale the other night I rode the escalator with a woman who said it should have been a series. I didnt read the Mark Helprin novel the movies based on but I did just lift up a hardback copy and nearly threw out my back. Its 672 pages which is to say the woman who loved the book and disliked the movie had a point. Still I dont know that six more hours of Colin Farrell riding a white horse with aurora borealis wings would help. This is a time-travel love fantasy featuring a consumptive English virgin (Jessica Brown Findlay) an Irish burglar (Farrell) his equine spirit animal and a demon gangster (Russell Crowe). There are also an American publishing baron (William Hurt) a dour New York food reporter (Jennifer Connelly) a totally different dying girl (Ripley Sobo) a high-powered newspaper scion (Eva Marie Saint) and two appearances by Lucifer whos played wearing a blazer T-shirt and vest by a Very Famous Movie Star in a not-so-secret cameo. I wont detail how these people connect to each other because should you wind up at this mess youll need a reason to laugh. The director and writer is the veteran Hollywood screenwriter and producer Akiva Goldsman whos done it all -- The Client Batman amp; Robin Cinderella Man A Beautiful Mind The Da Vinci Code I Am Legend. This is his debut as a director and I wish there were more to say about it than ""Come again now?"" He cant make you care about one world let alone the cosmic collision of two. Whenever someone asks why something happens to be the response tends to be something like ""Those are the rules."" Theyre just never made clear to us so it seems as though Goldsman is simply making things up as he goes. We never come to understand the magic that keeps Farrell looking like a member of My Chemical Romance for 10 decades. We never know why consumption makes women sexy. Most of the actors here have previously worked with Goldsman who it seems has called in several favors. (Would Connelly have her Oscar without him?) They all give their roles lots of tears and passion -- even the Very Famous Movie Star. But its a waste. If youve got these actors in your movie why are you bothering with magic at all? The magic should be them.  The best of this weeks remakes and the best of this weeks romances is also the least likely combination of the two. About Last Night is just like the 1986 movie of the same name (but without any ellipses). Now Michael Ealy Joy Bryant Kevin Hart and Regina Hall are in roles that Rob Lowe Demi Moore James Belushi and Elizabeth Perkins were all miscast in. Both movies are based on David Mamets 1974 play Sexual Perversity in Chicago. The play now feels like Mamet for beginners but the foundation is still solid enough for a sex comedy. In the new movie directed by Steve Pink and written by Leslye Headland who wrote and directed Bachelorette two coworkers (Ealy and Hart) have drinks with two roommates (Bryant and Hall). Hart and Hall have slept together once before. The movie delivers a play-by-play of the sex and just listening to Hall exclaim to Bryant that Harts pecker is the ""John Legend of penises"" is like going to sitcom-banter heaven. The whole movie is like that loud fast quippy made-for-TV. When Hart and Hall get fantastically drunk before going to have more sex in a bathroom Ealy walks Bryant home and a more traditional relationship starts. Hart and Hall fight and fuck and then fight some more while Ealy and Bryant who are both elegant natural actors drift into domestic malaise. None of what follows is profound. But the movies got energy and lewdness and warmth.1 Headlands script expands the parameters of Mamets play to make the women as funny as the men in the play think they are. This film has the looseness of a movie made of outtakes -- but they mostly work and they mostly involve Hall and Hart. Theyre the undercard that takes over the movie. Hall was Anna Fariss copilot in out-on-a-limb nonsense at the start of the Scary Movie series. And I always worry that the studios forget what she can do with a so-so comedy -- like knock Hart to the floor with laughter as she does toward the end of this movie. Shes great here using her body and her voice to bring something newly human out of her costar. So much of Harts shtick asks us to believe in his sexiness before he pulls a rug out from under it. What hes lacked are partners as credible as Ealy and Hall. He had his moments with Alan Arkin in Grudge Match but Arkin wast sparring with him -- he was flyswatting. Ride Along has made him a box office star but About Last Night makes a case for Hart as the kind of romantic comedian wholl stop humping your leg long enough to ask how your day was. The movie also has Ealy and Bryant in Ike and Tina Halloween costumes which means that after Jay Zs reference to them on Beyonces ""Drunk in Love"" it might be time to revisit why thats too loaded an allusion for so much glibness.

Its hard to find excellent writing like yours nowadays. I really appreciate individuals like you Take care Lukesaid on Monday July 07 2014 32120 AMNice review. I just saw this on DVD and it is SOO lame compared to the original. I miss Durwood Smith and Peter Weller. venia said on Sunday March 23 2014 24450 PMI agree with you Richard The first Robocop was much better than this one. This should have never been made. The first one had a story to go alone with the action. It was not just about the action the story back it up. I think this one was made just to show off the better special effects now in 2014 but that is not enough to save this movie I really wish they stop making 80s movies Hollywood is doing a terriable job. Jake Turnersaid on Tuesday February 25 2014 25132 PMFar too kind to this remake. It went from a politically satirical action packed R-rated blockbuster with memorable lines and Peter Weller to a politically correct bland peppered with video game action and a dumb story. Gary Oldman was the best part of the movie. Good review Richard. dale chawkinssaid on Friday February 21 2014 125051 AMNot as bad as I expected. Like the total recall remake a good enough time waster. Ronnie Ramirezsaid on Friday February 14 2014 44302 AMDoes it stand up to the times though??

"RoboCop Jose Padilhas remake of Paul Verhoevens schlock-art sensation reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Is the New RoboCop an Improvement on the Original? Is the New RoboCop an Improvement on the Original? Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Feb. 13 2014 614 PM RoboCop Is the spirit of the original still alive? By Dana Stevens Joel Kinnaman in RoboCop. Photo courtesy of Columbia Pictures One doesnt envy Jose Padilha the task of remaking RoboCop the 1987 schlock-art sensation that introduced the Dutch director Paul Verhoeven to American audiences. For one thing the basic premise--a Detroit cop is saved from the brink of death via reinvention as a cyborg only to be programmed by the corporation that designed him as an indiscriminate killing machine--now feels as unradical to the average filmgoer as the latest episode of Foxs new cop-with-a-robot-partner procedural Almost Human. In the era of sophisticated digital prostheses and Google Glass who among us isnt something of a cyborg? Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. But what really makes RoboCop a challenging remake is the originals peculiar tone an incongruous blend of bone-crunching violence waggish social satire and mournful Christian allegory. Verhoeven set his dystopian thriller in a recognizably Reagan-era landscape of urban chaos and Rust Belt decay and even wove fake TV commercials in and out of the action plot for the apparent sole purpose of mocking American consumerism and political obliviousness. (Reportedly Verhoeven inserted many of these ads after principal photography had ended in hopes of jollying the ratings board out of saddling his gory film with an X rating. The ploy worked and the R-rated RoboCop became one of the years sleeper hits both at the box office and among critics.) Padilha a Brazilian director whose previous credits include the extraordinary true-crime documentary Bus 174 and both installments of the well-regarded Elite Squad action franchise was under no obligation to recreate Verhoevens wackadoo recipe nor would it have been wise to try. But to justify the existence of a remake at all he and the films screenwriter Joshua Zetumer (adapting the original script by Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner) needed to establish an authorial approach and a fictional world that were comparably specific and complex. (Listen to me over here arguing for the need to ""justify"" rebooting a recognizable entertainment franchise to anyone but Mammon. I sound as quaint as the above use of the word cyborg.) Advertisement The term cyborg will apparently be completely out of circulation by 2028 when the new RoboCop is set. But there will still be drone warfare in the Middle East. The film opens on a TV news crew covering the latest from Tehran where public order is maintained by robot drones who keep the citizenry in a state of permanent fear. Noting all this approvingly from stateside is right-wing news pundit Pat Novak (Samuel L. Jackson) who bemoans the fact that robot technology hasnt been used more to address domestic crimes. Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton) the vaguely Steve Jobs-ian head of the not-at-all-menacing-sounding robotics company OmniCorp dreams of making and marketing a man/machine supercop hybrid. But he and his team of soulless marketing strategists (including an icy-cool Jennifer Ehle and a broadly comic Jay Baruchel) havent been able to find the right human subject for their dastardly experiment. That is until--thanks to a hard-to-follow criminal revenge conspiracy--Detroit beat detective Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) shows up in the emergency room with two amputated limbs and severe burns over 80 percent of his body. Murphys doctor Dr. Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman) tells the injured mans wife (Abbie Cornish) that the patients only shot at survival is to be recreated as a technologically augmented man-machine--a scientific development that the human race is apparently not planning on approaching in baby steps since the sleek metal Frankenstein Dr. Norton eventually creates is a fully operational super crime-fighter right out of the gate. When Murphy first glimpses himself in the mirror in his new state hes horrified--all the more so when in the movies most original and hauntingly icky image his doctor forces him to confront all that remains of his organic body under the ambulatory metal ""suit"" a head a hand a trachea and a pair of breathing lungs in a jar. This moment which uses simple special effects to horrifying success points in an interesting Cronenberg-like direction this Robocop might have taken--but unfortunately the scene marks the last time were asked to picture Alex as a fragile collection of free-floating organs. His human vulnerability soon becomes subsumed by the persona of the unstoppable crimebot his corporate masters are steadily turning him into fine-tuning his brain chemistry and rewiring his circuits every time a twinge of conscience begins to emerge. Neither Alex Murphys internal moral conflict nor the larger vaguely satiric portrait of a global culture dependent on high-tech law enforcement seem to be the main point of this Robocop remake which raises the question of what is meant to be the point. Kinnaman--a lanky quietly intense Swedish-American actor who was the only reason many of us kept watching AMCs ever-more-disappointing murder procedural The Killing--makes for a sympathetic hero but like many of his fellow cast members--most notably Keaton as the entrepreneurial Francis Bacon-collecting villain--Kinnaman often seems like a gifted performer chomping at the bit for something more interesting to do. Some of Samuel L. Jacksons direct-to-the-camera rants about the scourge of ""robophobia"" are funny but they seem to take place only on the empty echoing set of his cable-news show which exists in no discernible cultural or political landscape Whos watching the show? Whats their reaction? Similarly those opening scenes with their allegorical handwringing about drone crowd control in Iran evaporate like snowflakes in the heat of the eventual action plot. ""I wouldnt buy that for a dollar"" sneers a military-weapons expert played (memorably if briefly) by Jackie Earle Haley upon first encountering the flesh/metal hybrid hes been asked to train. Its a none-too-subtle rewrite of a much-quoted line from the original RoboCop and also a sadly apt tagline for the new one. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Kerry Hayes/Sony Pictures hide caption toggle caption Kerry Hayes/Sony Pictures RoboCop Director Jose Padilha Genre Action Science Fiction Running time 118 minutes Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of action including frenetic gun violence throughout brief strong language sensuality and some drug materialWith Joel Kinnaman Gary Oldman Michael Keaton Gotta feel a little sorry for director Jose Padilha tasked with taking over an action-classic remake that had been stuck in development for years -- and that fans of the much-admired original eyed with considerable skepticism. Watch The Trailer YouTube But lets also be honest for a moment about the movie Padilha is revisiting Paul Verhoevens 1987 RoboCop a B movie punching far above its weight with some cheekily subversive Establishment-tweaking and brilliantly executed subtext buried under some truly clunky performances and stock 80s action. In short There was plenty of room for improvement. And in taking advantage of that Padilhas new take on the material isnt the disaster some might have predicted. It doesnt hurt that Padilha and screenwriter Joshua Zetumer have even more fertile political material to work with in 2014. Verhoevens film had no shortage of targets -- among them rampant crime corruption the vapidity of media and entertainment and corporate greed. The update manages to work with all of those while also taking high-caliber shots at drone warfare flag-waving cable-news talking heads and the vulnerability of legislators to money and marketing. The basic story is the same Detroit cop Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) recently all but killed in the line of duty is rebuilt as a cyborg crime fighter by a huge corporation looking to mine the citys out-of-control crime troubles for profit. As before nearly everyone involved is crooked in one way or another and its up to our metallic hero to find the humanity still tangled up amid the circuitry thats so thoroughly clouding his brain functions so he can clean up more than just the citys streets. Around that core the biggest improvement is in the performances -- no surprise with names like Michael Keaton and Gary Oldman at the top of the cast list. Keaton plays conniving OmniCorp head honcho Raymond Sellars Oldman the morally compromised biomechanics visionary Dr. Dennett Norton; its the battle of wills between these two men that really drives this new RoboCop with Murphy as a kind of hulking rag doll being pulled in both directions by the competing needs of commerce and science. Keaton brings a smug but personable arrogance to his role -- just the kind of charismatic sliminess it requires -- while Oldman is the movies wobbly moral center a good man corrupted by circumstance and weakness. Norton is a doctor who wants funding to further research and develop mechanical prosthetics but Sellars cares only about using the scientists successes to influence legislation that would let him supply fully automated crime-control drones to the government. The CEOs primary ally is Mattox (Jackie Earl Haley) a robot tactician who finds RoboCop a laughable project -- like his boss he favors pure robotics over the cyborg approach. All those political threads are on point but the film is strongest when its wrestling with notions of what it really means to be human -- this after Murphy has been reduced to literally nothing more than a head heart and lungs encased in a metal shell. (The big reveal of his true physical state is an eye-opening effect.) If the undercurrent of the story has echoes of Frankenstein Mattox sees Murphy as nothing more than a hollow Tin Man and underlines his derision with a nicely deployed rendition of ""If I Only Had a Heart"" during a key training sequence. Even with those excellent performances augmented by a fantastically entertaining Samuel L. Jackson as a wild-eyed right-wing TV political host theres still something about Padilhas RoboCop that feels cold and distant. Part of the charm of the original was its raggedness its embrace of a B-movie aesthetic in the service of smart dark satire. Padilhas take is almost all business as grimly efficient at getting its points across as Murphy himself is during the period when his handlers have suppressed his emotions entirely. Its well made polished and hits every mark -- but is it crazy to want a futuristic sci-fi action flick about a motorcycle-riding metal supercop to be just a little more fun?

That doesnt mean its especially good. But its a rare ""reboot"" that transcends its studios money-grubbing. It has some Big Ideas. Theyre extensions of the ones in the original a riotous and regrettably prescient satire of private enterprise worming its way into the crime-fighting business and obliterating civil liberties. Bludgeoned by fear society has grown coarse -- perhaps to the point that the citizenry longs for fascist might. Verhoeven as usual has it both ways. You register the loss of humanity but get off on the violence anyway. The corruption is painless. As the new RoboCop opens ""OmniCorp"" is testing its robo-technology in Tehran in a live link with an OReilly Factor-style program (The Novak Element) starring Samuel L. Jackson (or is it Laurence Fishburne?) as a law-and-order blowhard. The companys robot enforcers are billed as the latest evolution in drone technology although they prove almost as inept as actual drones at distinguishing genuine threats from empty shows of defiance. (A kid with a knife gets blown to bits.) Whats needed says a marketing whiz (Jay Baruchel) to the CEO Sellars (Michael Keaton) is an inner human with whom the public can identify. The top brass review video of severely maimed U.S. vets before settling on incorruptible Detroit cop Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) -- whom weve just seen blown up by gangsters in his familys driveway. Dr. Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman) gets to work detaching Murphys head and vital organs from his body and designing a heavy-metal shell for whats left. The first thing I missed was the central sequence of Verhoevens original in which Murphy (Peter Weller) is sadistically murdered and then brought back to life in a series of blackouts seen from his point-of-view -- shots of doctors and scientist adjusting his visor and snapping him on and off. The cruelty of the killing and the quasi-religious resurrection were staggeringly effective. Director Jose Padilha doesnt make much of that resurrection; hes rather matter-of-fact about it. The first Murphy had scant memories of the life he led before whereas the remakes sentimental core is Murphys ongoing relationship with his wife (Abbie Cornish) and young son (John Paul Ruttan). To make him more efficient on the battlefield Norton must deaden more and more of the part of his brain that controls his human emotions and his memories. What no one expects is that emotion will bleed through and in effect create its own neural pathways. Obviously thats an anti-deterministic hopeful view of humanity -- a far cry from the originals pervasive nihilism. Whats odd is that it doesnt have much emotional heft. The villains arent as hateful -- they have no stature -- and dont get rousing comeuppances. (Oh for something like the guy who gets semi-dissolved by toxic waste and then splattered by a truck) And Kinnaman might be too subtle an actor -- his face reads the same when hes robotic and human. Padilha a Brazilian made one of the most powerful documentaries Ive ever seen Bus 174 a genuine tragedy that made you loathe police brutality. Hes too much of a humanist for RoboCop. And he doesnt give enough weight to Robo-Murphys investigation of his own murder. Its too easy for Murphy to access surveillance tapes and nail the culprits. Theres no detective work. What he and screenwriter Joshua Ketumer do superbly is chart the thinking at the top of OmniCorp. Keaton plays the CEO as driven even manic moving at too high a speed to weigh the morality of his actions -- hes like a studio head. Jennifer Ehle is equally smart at his top aide She often seems on the verge of objecting to his methods but then goes along with alacrity. Baruchel (he was Seth Rogens buddy in This Is the End) plays the marketing man too broadly -- hes channeling Christian Slater channeling Jack Nicholson in Heathers with a bit of the yuppie creep in Die Hard thrown in. But his lines are good. If theres one thing Hollywood people understand its marketing. And Jacksons Novak is an inspired touch. He demonstrates the easy collusion between private enterprise and corporate media -- and the effectiveness of its anti-liberal law-and-order rhetoric. Oldman gives RoboCop its moral center. Hes a dead ringer for Bruce Davison (one of my favorite actors) and he manages to turn the film into a character study. Norton is excited to test his power over Murphys brain in the name of science -- and driven to pull back in the name of decency and compassion. Is the softness of this RoboCop a mark of similar decency -- or of the studios desire to appeal to a broad PG-13 audience instead of the hard-R gore freaks (like me) whove seen the original over and over? Lets assume its the latter. But we can still give one cheer for filmmakers with enough integrity to create their own neural pathways.

In 2028 Detroit when Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) is critically injured in the line of duty the conglomerate OmniCorp sees their chance for a part-man part-robot police officer. (Photo/Video Sony) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Feb. 13 2014 225 p.m. ET When RoboCops helmet isnt down in combat mode his Achilles heel is his head. The same goes for this muddle-brained remake with Joel Kinnaman as Alex Murphy the shattered human trapped in the high-tech armor. Its not that the filmmakers--Jose Padilha directing from a screenplay by Joshua Zetumer--havent worked hard to retrofit Paul Verhoevens 1987 sci-fi classic for duty in the 21st century. But theyve overburdened their story with underbaked notions about U.S. militarism corporate greed the importance of empathy and the nature of consciousness as well as robotics versus what the film calls organics--not pesticide-free veggies but free-willed flesh and blood that in the case of unlucky Alex has been reprogrammed for ruthless efficiency. The result is fitfully interesting and Mr. Kinnaman best known for ""The Killing"" on television compels our empathy with a kind of macho melancholia. Still the whole thing comes down to an action adventure thats graphics-rich logic-poor coherence-challenged and pleasure-impaired. The first few seconds promise something brighter. Over the familiar MGM logo at just the moment Leo the Lion is supposed to roar we hear a charmingly bizarre sound somewhere between a babble and a trill. Thats it for levity though. The sound turns out to be the vocal warmup exercise of a TV personality named Pat Novak. An odious ultranationalist with a booming voice he is played in sledgehammer style thats supposed to be satirical by Samuel L. Jackson. Novak is there to celebrate an occupying force of giant robots that as his viewers see in a live report patrol the streets of a terrified Tehran as part of something called Operation Freedom. (Note to Irans emerging moderates its only a movie guys.) ""Its great"" Novak chortles ""to see American machines promoting peace and freedom abroad."" So what does this jingoism have to do with patrolling the streets of Detroit? (Yes RoboCop still works for the Detroit Police Department; for all its variations and speculations the script sticks close to the original structure.) In the films echo-mimicry of current events robots on foreign soil evoke drones--the terms are used interchangeably--and drones provoke a debate about using robot cops on U.S. soil. ""Why"" Novak laments ""is America so robophobic?"" This leads to still another debate about designing a robocop thats acceptable to the American public. ""Weve gotta give Americans a product they can love"" says a cynical corporate executive played by Michael Keaton ""a product with a conscience something that knows what its like to be human."" The countervailing argument--the law-and-order position in the context of the cartoony dialectic--becomes clear when Alex is chosen for the prototype and finally activated. Preserving empathy circuits in his brain slows his reflexes. Humanity degrades performance. The argument against so much back-and-forth is that dialectics arent drama. The original ""RoboCop"" became a classic because of the clarity and sly humor with which it dramatized a potent idea. This remake reflecting its era all too accurately bounces from one hyperlinked notion to the next--and one videogamelike simulation to the next--while Alex or whats left of him undergoes acute information overload thanks to networks of security cameras and criminal databases that hes been plugged into. The supporting cast includes Gary Oldman Abbie Cornish Jackie Earle Haley Jennifer Ehle and Marianne Jean-Baptiste. Theyre more fun to watch than Mr. Kinnaman unburdened as they are by solemn significance. Watch a clip from the film ""Winters Tale."" A burglar (Colin Farrell) falls for an heiress as she dies in his arms. When he learns that he has the gift of reincarnation he sets out to save her. (Photo/Video Warner Bros.) Winters Tale Earlier this week I received an email from which Ill excerpt the salient passage Please tell me that Winters Tale is a great movie befitting a wonderful book one of my favorites.... It would kill me to see the book butchered so Ill have to rely on your judgment to decide whether to rush to the theater on Friday or pretend it never happened. But please please please give me good news Id like to pretend it never happened but it did and the news is befuddlingly bad though I could be prejudiced because I found the Mark Helprin novel so diffuse and pretentious that I never finished it. Be that as it may a surrealist love story with countless admirers has been reduced by Akiva Goldsmans screen version to a potboiler brimming with treacly preachments. The main one concerns connectivity--not in the digital but the cosmic sense i.e. we are all connected were all part of a grand design. Lets hope so but the movie is a prodigy of disconnection one that perpetrates graceless leaps and hapless lurches of logic in the name of magic realism. Two memorable moments in this regard involve the winged white horse Athansor who serves as guardian angel for the hero Peter Lake (Colin Farrell) across a century of time. Back in the early years of the 20th century when Peter finds the love of his life in the beautiful but sickly Beverly Penn (Jessica Brown Findlay) the horse rescues the couple from the demonic Pearly Soames (Russell Crowe floridly guttural) by flying them off a cliff to a frozen river. ""How is that even possible?"" asks Beverly. Shes pleasantly surprised you understand but essentially disconnected from the miracle that has just occurred. (Peters mumbled reply is even more obtuse ""Dunno. The horse."") Later in 21st century Manhattan the horse shows up again on the roof of an apartment building just in time to save the still-young Peter a woman named Virginia (Jennifer Connelly) and her sickly young daughter. ""Theres a horse on the roof"" Virginia says. Its an accurate observation and an amazement if ever there was one. Whats amazing about the scene though is Virginias disconnection from this new miracle--she too registers mild surprise at the most--and the directors disconnection from her bland response. Could anyone have made a creditable movie out of the book? Maybe not; magic realism works best in the privacy of the mind. In fact Mr. Farrell and Ms. Findlay are appealing as the star-crossed lovers Will Smith has an agreeably weird cameo as Lucifer and its lovely to have Eva Marie Saint in a small role asking ""What if we are all unique and the universe loves us all equally?"" But Mr. Goldsman a first-time director though a veteran screenwriter has been done in by the source material. Either he climbed aboard a horse that was too much for him or the universe gave him a bum steer. Watch a clip from the documentary film ""The Last of the Unjust."" In 1975 Claude Lanzmann filmed a series of interviews with Benjamin Murmelstein the only ""Elder of the Jews"" not to have been killed during World War II. (Photo/Video Cohen Media Group) The Last of the Unjust Before making ""Shoah"" his 1985 masterpiece about the Holocaust Claude Lanzmann decided against using documentary footage in favor of interviews--91/2 hours of screen time in the final version devoted to survivors eyewitnesses and ex-Nazis. Almost three decades later in 2013 he completed ""The Last of the Unjust"" which is compact by comparison at 220 minutes and centers on a single extended interview--basically an outtake from ""Shoah""--with a singular figure in Holocaust history. Mr. Lanzmanns subject who sat for the camera in Rome in 1975 is Benjamin Murmelstein the last Jewish elder of the Theresienstadt concentration camp and the only Jewish elder to survive Nazi Germanys campaign of extermination. The new film may not qualify for masterpiece status but its an enthralling portrait of a man--an exceptionally brilliant and articulate man--who personified the courage complexity and moral ambiguity of his tortured time. The films title is a play on another masterpiece Andre Schwartz-Barts novel ""The Last of the Just."" The phrase was first coined not by the filmmaker but by Mr. Murmelstein who used it sardonically to describe himself because hed been accused by fellow Jews of having collaborated with the Nazis in administering Theresienstadt an infamous model camp depicted by Nazi propaganda films as a pleasant place where prisoners played music read books and applied themselves willingly to good clean work. Mr. Murmelstein stood trial after the war. He was acquitted of all charges but questions remained. Mr. Lanzmann who is now 88 raises them again by way of the 1975 interviews which are supplemented by his recent visits to sites of Holocaust horror in Vienna and the Czech Republic. In those earlier conversations Mr. Murmelstein addresses the filmmakers questions and sharp skepticism with formidable passion and a precision verging on total recall. In the process he describes Jewish elders as having been ""between the anvil and the hammer""--negotiating with the Nazis to save their own people--and likens himself as a camp administrator to Sancho Panza ""While others are tilting at windmills hes a calculating realist with two feet on the ground."" He also scorns any notion of the banality of evil as it applies to Adolf Eichmann whom he knew and dealt with frequently as a rabbi in prewar Vienna. Eichmann wasnt banal Mr. Murmelstein says ""he was a demon."" But does the self-styled last of the unjust exonerate himself? The film leaves that of necessity for us to judge. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download ENLARGE Easy Money (2010) Joel Kinnaman born of a Swedish mother and an American father stars in this impressive Swedish thriller as Johan ""JW"" Westlund a business student from a working-class family and a man of many parts most of them bogus. What makes JW interesting isnt so much his skewed vision of right and wrong but the ambiguity of his personality. Like the seductive and elusive hero of ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" he isnt quite there. The director Daniel Espinosa handles the heros social climbing and the multicultural criminality that surrounds him with great aplomb and relentless energy. ENLARGE Miami Vice (2006) The rap on Colin Farrell has often been that hes a great character actor but not a movie star. Yet hes a star in every sense of the term in Michael Manns big-screen update of his 1980s TV series. Jamie Foxx co-stars in a somewhat lesser role; theyre the contemporary incarnations of Detective James ""Sonny"" Crockett and Detective Ricardo ""Rico"" Tubbs a pair of thoroughbred clotheshorses originally played on the small screen by Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas. Gong Li is Isabella the Chinese-Cuban financial wizard of a globalized drug cartel. ENLARGE Mr. Death The Rise and Fall of Fred A. Leuchter Jr. (1999) The Holocaust by reflected light in a distorting mirror. The subject of Errol Morriss remarkable documentary used to build restore and maintain execution machines. He considered himself a humanitarian indeed a benefactor because his machines killed quickly and efficiently. Then he became a prominent Holocaust denier. The film connects those phases of Mr. Leuchters life the better to understand how the Holocaust occurred. Mr. Morris never demonizes his subject or denies his humanity. To the contrary ""Mr. Death"" wants us to see how one of them could also be one of us.

More like Robo-Flop REVIEW It has a big budget strong cast and star director but the new ""RoboCop"" lacks the originals audacious satire. February 13 2014 -- 243pm Columbia Pictures Joel Kinnaman is a Detroit police detective who becomes ""RoboCop"" in the remake of Paul Verhoevens 1987 original. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert It was with a rising sense of anguish that I watched the ""RoboCop"" remake. I have seen hateful cover versions of ""Psycho"" ""Straw Dogs"" ""Lolita"" ""Arthur"" and ""The Wolfman"" mangled by greedy studios and uninspired filmmakers. None of that matched my dismay at this act of vandalism. The inspired 1987 original was a savage satire of all the social forces turning us into automatons and humanoids. I would advise anyone with fond memories of Paul Verhoevens movie to cross the street and avoid seeing this flimsy facsimile. The film opens in a near-future news program with Samuel L. Jackson as the opinionated host. He propagandizes on the merits of a fully mechanized police force patrolling Americas cities an idea met with much public skepticism. A remote news crew shows bigfoot robots on the pacified streets of Tehran. Predictably things do not go well. The films many many opening chapters detail the efforts of military contractor Omnicorp to overcome its political opponents in Washington. Director Jose Padilha captures the C-SPAN feel of the proceedings but doesnt tap into the near-universal distrust Americans feel toward Capitol Hill. Padilha lacks Verhoevens comic rapport with the audience. Back at Omnicorp headquarters CEO Michael Keaton floats a radical idea. Wouldnt public opinion swing his way if the machines literally had human faces? One bomb blast and several surgeries later Omnicorp has its prototype with Detroit detective and family man Joel Kinnaman peering out of the newer sleeker (and focus-group-approved) robo-suit. Padilha is a superstar Brazilian filmmaker. His superb urban crime documentary ""Bus 174"" and electrifying ""Elite Squad"" cop thrillers cant be overpraised. And he handles the movies numerous shootouts masterfully given the restrictions of PG-13 filmmaking. ROBOCOP 1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of action including frenetic gun violence throughout brief strong language sensuality and some drug material. But his instinct to push the story toward serious drama is misguided. The 1987 film gave us numerous colorful villains whose comeuppance was thrilling. Here theyre a colorless lot anonymous bullet fodder. The focus here is on intimate drama. And so we get family scenes with Abbie Cornish as Kinnamans wife still in love with her much reworked husband. And scenes of Gary Oldman as RoboCops conflicted creator debating the morality of his experiments with his test subject. The meat of the story where Kinnaman hunts down his own would-be killers takes forever to arrive. In defense of those involved I must say that no expense or effort was spared here. Misguided as it is this is no cheap ripoff. It looks impressive. The cast is seriously talented. The script is an honest effort to address our current anxieties of total surveillance and police state overreach. But a too-solemn ""Batman Begins"" air hangs over the enterprise. With the farce lost and ponderous themes of free will pushed to the forefront the movie is somber when it should be audacious lumbering where it needs levity. With its ruthless humor removed and a child-friendly PG-13 rating in place of a bullet-riddled R this is a travesty of a classic. Its not just ""Diet RoboCop"" or ""RoboCop Lite"" its ""RoboCop Zero."" Colin Covert has covered films for the Star Tribune for 20 years interviewing Peter Jackson Kate Winslet Steven Spielberg Cate Blanchett Quentin Tarantino Neil Gaiman and John Travolta to name a few.

But they can also take off their suits -- and RoboCop cant. In two grim shots in RoboCop whats left of Joel Kinnamans Alex Murphy is exposed when his machinery is removed part of his head his heart his lungs and his hand. Thats all. He cant take off his suit; he cant even always control his own thoughts or actions. Nobody wants to be RoboCop -- not even Alex Murphy. But if nobody wants to be RoboCop why would they want to watch the movie of that same name? Robert Downey Jr. has snarky one-liners and Christian Bale has brooding reflections on morality but Kinnaman has a robotic voice and not much else. Often you cant even hear that voice over the clanking and zipping noises his suit makes as he walks or turns his head. (Surely if they could design a suit that can sustain a man who has only 10 percent of his body left they could make the equipment quieter than that.) The wish fulfillment factor taken out of the equation RoboCop becomes less a work of aspirational coolness and more a piece of political satire -- and not necessarily a bad one. In the opening sequence a conservative news pundit (Samuel L. Jacksons Pat Novak) makes a case that the Dreyfus Act a law which prohibits robots in American police forces should be repealed by sending a reporter abroad to watch robot cops in action. After an obligatory shot of an ominous drone flying above robot policemen things go disastrously wrong. Suicide bombers attack and a child who grabs a knife to defend his suicide bomber father is killed by one of the robots. The station feed clicks off. Bad guy OmniCorp CEO Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton) hopes to create a robot with a conscience to win over American voters ahead of the vote to repeal the Dreyfus Act. His prayers are answered in the form of Murphy recently injured by dirty cops in his Detroit precinct -- and thus RoboCop is born. In trials they nickname RoboCop ""Tinman"" and jokingly play ""If I Only Had a Brain"" during simulations where he must compete against brainless robots. But as OmniCorps resident genius Dr. Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman) tinkers with the chips inserted into Murhpys brain and RoboCop becomes less a man-turned-robot and more a robot who thinks hes a man the Wizard of Oz metaphors grow more portentous. Should we be afraid of anything with a weapon but without conscience? Director Jose Padilha isnt subtle in his critique of dissociated violence. In one sequence RoboCop takes on about 50 bad guys in the dark by detecting them with heat vision. From the machines perspective the scene plays out like a first person shooter dozens of bad guys highlighted and easily taken down with quick shots and no real way for him to die. But when the camera takes the criminals point-of-view we see real bullets real wounds real death and the attendant pathos. Even RoboCops partner Jack Lewis (Michael K. Williams) suffers the consequences of being in close proximity to the immortal machine. He is shot twice in the film. (Williams was a lot better off with a sawed off shotgun in The Wire than here.) Its a sobering concept for a film but occasionally it takes a humorous turn usually thanks to Samuel L. Jackson who delights in playing a radical conservative who can make holograms of liberals like Dreyfus disappear from his show just as they begin making their argument. Anyone unfamiliar with the original franchise can jump right in and Jackson makes it worth sitting through yet another movie with endless sequences of robots fighting more robots. Just barely though.

In an era when real-life police look ever more like RoboCop this sleek dull remake is a missed opportunity Andrew OHehir Follow Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Action movies Gary Oldman Joel Kinnaman Jose Padilha Movies Paul Verhoeven robocop Science Fiction and Fantasy Entertainment News Joel Kinnaman in ""RoboCop"" (Credit Kerry Hayes/Columbia Pictures) Its 80s weekend in Americas multiplexes and while I guess thats always true people of my approximate generation may well wonder whether theyve tumbled into the hot-tub time machine. In addition to the confusing push-me-pull-you spectacle that is the ""RoboCop"" remake this week also brings us a new version of ""Endless Love"" (not technically a remake of the Brooke Shields film) and a new version of ""About Last Night"" which is a remake (with an all-black cast) of the 1986 Rob Lowe-Demi Moore movie itself adapted from David Mamets play ""Sexual Perversity in Chicago."" Where is Marty McFly in all this?I hear ""About Last Night"" which was written by the hilarious Leslye Headland is pretty good but thats just me trying to change the subject. As for ""RoboCop"" well jeez. Lets put it this way What did you think would happen when a Hollywood studio decided to remake Paul Verhoevens acrid ultraviolent social satire of the Reagan years a movie that shaped both an era and a sensibility? Theres no re-creating that moment or its impact not when were barraged with so many semi-ironic visions of the dystopian future that their power has leached away into the soil. What were left with is a teen-oriented action flick with an A-minus cast a mixture of ""Transformers""-style robot battles and cops-and-robbers showdown that never feels all that exciting or cutting-edge bracketed by some intriguing and half-successful moments of social commentary.There are some interesting things about ""RoboCop"" and -- no wait thats a lie. Lets say there are some interesting things about its creation about the fact that it exists and the form it takes along with a few sporadic stirrings of life within the movie itself. You can sense that the producers tried to replicate the chemistry of the original They imported Brazilian director Jose Padilha of the award-winning (and splatterific) ""Elite Squad"" movies a left-wing intellectual with an appetite for violence who makes a reasonable candidate to fill the Verhoeven dissident-prankster role in Hollywood. They elevated a good-looking semi-unknown to play the title role in this case Swedish actor Joel Kinnaman star of the international hit ""Easy Money"" (aka ""Snabba Cash"") and the AMC series ""The Killing."" They gave full credit to the original 1987 script by Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner adapted here by newcomer Joshua Zetumer.And the results are well definitely not the worst science-fiction movie ever though I fear its true (as Forbes columnist Scott Mendelson has suggested) that not just the original movie but its two non-Verhoeven sequels are better funnier and more trenchant than this remake. By far the most startling scene in this ""RoboCop"" and almost the only one where I feel Padilha putting his own stamp on the material rather than submitting to it comes right at the beginning ""We"" have conquered Iran sometime around 2028 with an entirely automated force of robot warriors and no loss of life. A burbling TV reporter on the streets of Tehran celebrates the Iranian peoples total submission to their new machine overlords at least until shes interrupted by a suicide-bomber counterattack staged while the whole world is watching. Just as one of the American robots is about to slaughter an 11-year-old kid holding a kitchen knife the Pentagon cuts the feed throwing it back to the oleaginous right-wing studio host played by Samuel L. Jackson with an American flag pin and a dubious permanent-wave wig. You Might Also Like So Padilha manages to reference the Obama-era drone war the Cheney-Wolfowitz fantasies about the liberation of Iraq and the toadying propagandistic mass media within about five minutes -- and then nothing else in the rest of the movie comes close to that. Yes the maimed body of Detroit police officer Alex Murphy (Kinnaman) left for dead after a car bombing in his own driveway becomes the intersection of political corruption and corporate power but not in any surprising or unfamiliar way. As in the original Alex was blown up by an alliance of evil mobsters and dirty cops and then becomes the subject of a scientific technological and political experiment. Given the extent to which big-city police departments have indeed become paramilitary robot-cop squads in our century this recycled script feels obtuse and almost antique as if its willfully blocking out real-world parallels.Kinnaman whos so suave and charismatic in the ""Easy Money"" films really doesnt make a strong impression here either because hes playing a stoical Yank cop who gets robotized or because Zetumers screenplay gives him nothing interesting to do. Gary Oldman lends a note of humanity to the conflicted scientist who encases Murphys gruesomely stitched-together remnants in a robot exoskeleton but the only truly enjoyable roles are the nefarious ones Michael Keaton as the unctuous zillionaire masterminding Alexs reappearance as a new-product launch Jay Baruchel as a weaselly bearded marketing whiz and Jennifer Ehle (long a stealer of movies) as a hard-boiled corporate enforcer. I admire Padilhas Brazilian films (especially the documentaries ""Bus 174"" and ""Secrets of the Tribe"") and I wish I could say that he takes naturally to the weird and artificial environment of big-budget Hollywood filmmaking the way Verhoeven once did. The movie has a handsome sleek veneer (shot on digital video by Lula Carvalho Padilhas frequent collaborator) and features some excellent special effects notably the grotesque rendering of Murphy post-bombing as little more than a brain a heart and a pair of lungs the bare minimum of human hardware. But it may be that the cracks in the system exploited by Verhoeven dont exist anymore and the perversity and ambiguity of his work has specifically been suppressed. In this ""RoboCop"" it feels like the director the studio and the so-called message all fought each other to a robot-war stalemate ending in a series of dull and incomprehensible action sequences and a transparent plea to the audience to come back for more.

"Robocop | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; robocop_2725 ) Robocop (United States 2014) February 12 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli 2014s iteration of Robocop is a kinder gentler version of Paul Verhoevens 1987 sci-fi orgy of violence. The storyline has been trimmed and reworked to allow it to slide under the PG-13 bar. That means a brutal torture/murder sequence is no more and a key battle has been reduced to a series of shaky-cam quick edits that transforms the fight into a largely incoherent series of flashes and bangs. All things considered however director Jose Padilhas Robocop reboot does some of the things a good remake should do it retains the central ideas and themes of the original while updating and rearranging the narrative to lose a derivative feel. Robocop is set in the near future. Drones manufactured by OmniCorp a conglomerate owned by Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton) have become one of the dominant world-wide forms of police but are barred by law from being used on U.S. soil. Recognizing the potential revenue being lost Sellars embarks upon an ambitious project create a cybernetic cop that combines the brain and heart of a man with a robotic body. His choice for ""Robocop"" Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) a morally upright Detroit policeman who is critically injured when his car explodes. With the permission of Murphys distraught wife Clara (Abbie Cornish) Sellars chief doctor Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman) builds a new body that looks like a cross between Iron Man and a Cylon. With his emotions carefully controlled and a ""kill switch"" in place (in case he should turn against his ""owners"") Robocop is introduced to the public and becomes an immediate sensation. As a science fiction action film Robocop is mostly successful although some of the subplots - such as Robocops investigation into Murphys ""murder"" - are underdeveloped. Aside from the one battle where the fighting is obscured to mute the violence the combat sequences are effectively choreographed including one special effects-laden scene in which Robocop takes on a group of imposing drones. The climax is surprisingly low-key but effective nonetheless validating the perspective that action movies dont always have to conclude with a loud bang. 2014s Robocop is more character-based than its predecessor. Unlike in Verhoevens version Murphys family isnt informed of his ""death""; he is therefore given the opportunity to re-connect with his wife and son after his conversion. Their continued relationship represents a major plot element and this dynamic represents a shift from the one in the 1987 movie where Murphy with the help of his new partner spent much of the running time attempting to remember his past. Here its about reconnecting with his lost humanity and finding a path forward. Robocop wants to be more than an action-oriented robo-romp. It wants to provide social commentary. To that end Padilha provides clips from a TV talk show hosted by ultra-conservative Pat Novak (Samuel L. Jackson) who champions Sellars drone program and lambastes gutless politicians who back the law banning their use. This is intended to evoke the timeless debate of how much freedom people are willing to surrender in the name of greater security but Robocop doesnt offer anything thats new or especially thought provoking. Its points are disappointingly shallow and its attempts at satire pale in comparison to Verhoevens edgy jabs. The cast represents an intriguing blend of familiar faces and relative unknowns. Stepping into Peter Wellers boots is Joel Kinnaman the Swedish-born actor who made his name in The Killing. Jennifer Ehle who played Elizabeth Bennett to Colin Firths Darcy two decades ago is Sellars dour assistant. Abbie Cornish the Australian character actress whose filmography is a patchwork of offbeat and intriguing titles plays Murphys wife. Michael Keaton leaves Batman far behind to turn up the sleaze as Sellars. Gary Oldman has the most three-dimensional role although a significant dose of ambiguity might have made Dr. Norton more interesting. Samuel L. Jackson uses his strident reputation to good effect portraying Novak - even getting an opportunity to provide a ""Samuel L. Jackson moment."" Robocop had a long and divisive journey to the screen. Originally the remake was to be helmed by Darren Aronofsky. When he departed the project the well-received screenplay was gutted by incoming director Padilha who later complained of massive studio interference. Any behind-the-scenes conflicts are ultimately no more than a curiosity because the finished version while not in the same category as the original represents respectable midwinter entertainment. Although Robocop may not quite reach its goals it at least aspires to be more than just another dumb special effects-focused blockbuster and it deserves credit not only for that but for holding the viewers attention for two hours.

The crackerjack satirical future-shock classic of 1987 centered on a hero who was hauntingly poised between being a Terminator cyborg and a soulful shard of his former human self. He was a real ghost in the machine. In the new RoboCop Joel Kinnaman cast because hes as naturally steely as Peter Weller sometimes plays RoboCop as the thinking feeling family man he once was and sometimes hes pure shoot-em-up droid crime fighter -- which can feel like the film trying to have it both ways. After Kinnamans Alex Murphy is nearly killed by thugs hes built into RoboCop as a marketing ploy The CEO of OmniCorp (Michael Keaton) wants to sell robot law enforcers to the American people. The film has lots of energized mayhem and Murphys unraveling of the conspiracy against him isnt dumbed down yet its as if the comic-book action poetry of the original has been encased in a suit of generic armor.

Williams Jennifer Ehle Jay Baruchel and Samuel L. Jackson Directed by Jose Padilha Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of action including frenetic gun violence throughout brief strong language sensuality and some drug material Running time 1 hour 58 minutes Playing Throughout Orange County (See theaters and movie times)The quick hitThis reboot of the sci-fi cult film about the creation and deployment of a cyborg cop pays off in intrigue rather than thrills; it boasts a valiant performance by Joel Kinnaman in the title role and a slew of colorful topical supporting turns. Grade B In his spaghetti Westerns Sergio Leone surrounded Clint Eastwoods tall monotone killer with extroverts and comic grotesques who kept the audience primed for action and made his antihero look supercool. In his reboot of ""RoboCop"" (1987) Brazilian director Jose Padilha does something excitingly similar. He encircles his taller often more monotone killer with a crew of scene-stealing actors playing a succession of torn-from-the-headlines types. The movie is set in 2028 - close enough to make its Detroit settings familiar distant enough to make its far-out action credible and of course leave room for another reboot. The result is a sardonic grisly merry-go-round. At dead center is a visionary techno-capitalist (Michael Keaton) whose company has made billions building robot security squads for use overseas. Because the Senate has banned them from the U.S. he tasks his chief bio-engineer (Gary Oldman) with creating a similar product that Americans can ""love."" This not-so-mad scientist thinks the answer is to put a human face on a robot body - and a human brain inside. After righteous Detroit policeman Alex Murphy loses everything to an explosion except his mind lungs heart and one hand hes picked to become RoboCop. His wife (Abbie Cornish) and son (John Paul Ruttan) who saw his dad nearly killed are as shaken when he turns cyborg as the family in Showtimes ""Homeland"" when the man of the house comes home a terrorist. With a host of others - notably Jackie Earle Haley as the gung-ho military vet in charge of the company robots Jay Baruchel as the excitable head of corporate marketing and Michael K. Williams as Murphys righteous Detroit PD partner - Padilha and screenwriter Joshua Zetumer concoct a bubbling stew of terror-streaked social satire and teary domestic drama. What binds it is the emotional force of the actor who gives his face to RoboCop. The half-Swedish half-American Joel Kinnaman best known here as the star of the AMC series ""The Killing"" does all you can ask and then some for a performer building character with a patch of flesh. Looking like a young Keith Carradine he expresses confused wonder as he senses the freedom of his mechanical body then horror when its designer reveals how little of his ""real"" self is left. That haunting image sums up 82 years of disembodied brains in movies - and tops them in gruesomeness if not imagination. Kinnaman gets his last chance to act when he depicts Murphy fading out as Oldman drops his dopamine levels to cancel his uncontrollable emotions. Its unfortunate that the movie forces Kinnaman to play on a spectrum thats depressed at one end and insensate at the other. The movie would be more stirring if the central character had highs to match his lows. The original ""RoboCop"" - cartoonishly violent erratically inventive - ended up little more than a revenge shoot-em-up. But it was a defiantly pop creation - definitely a comic-book movie though not based on an actual comic book - and it never lost its grip on adolescent fantasy. This tonier version seems targeted toward readers of graphic novels. In many ways thats no improvement. Padilha the Brazilian director who made his name directing a revelatory documentary about a hostage crisis ""Bus 174"" stages the introductory scenes of dirty cops and double crosses in Detroit as straightforward social realism; they wouldnt look out of place on ""The Wire."" Even when Murphy becomes RoboCop Padilha fails to stylize the action in ways that would make it exhilarating. His big set pieces play out like bang-bang video games. And he allows several actors to lose their footing. The worst offender is Samuel L. Jackson who provides a thudding burlesque of blustery TV pundits. By contrast one of the original movies strengths was its hilarious takeoff of 80s ""Eyewitness News"" channels. Still as this movies director barrels through a cluttered story he allows us to entertain diverse ideas with an emphasis on ""entertain."" Much of the movie riffs on RoboCops illusions of free will. The film overflows with intriguing notions throughout whether about collateral damage in the Middle East or the pluses and minuses of the human factor. Most refreshing in an age when Steve Jobs has been lionized this film makes barbed fun of a demanding ""creative"" corporation head. Keatons obsessive technocrat wants his visions realized at all costs and employs hundreds of Chinese workers to make it happen. Maybe it takes a movie from a lowdown franchise like ""RoboCop"" to suggest that a driven boss in love with his own ideas could be more inhuman than cyborgs.

In 1987 Paul Verhoevens RoboCop cemented it as the most violent city in the world an honor the Motor City resented for decades until its powers that be realized they may as well erect a statue of Peter Weller and milk the tourism. Twenty-seven years later the attention has shifted to Tehran. Jose Padilhas RoboCop opens on a news broadcast of soldier-bots terrorizing the Iranian population -- make that ""promoting peace and freedom abroad"" as hawkish TV host Pat Novak (Samuel L. Jackson) insists. The feed cuts out as suicide bombers rush the robots. By contrast the gun smugglers of Detroit look practically genteel. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - This RoboCop lacks the bloody biting scream of the 87 version.Still as ever in the future America of this new RoboCop theres a segment of our populace that worships guns ammo and overkill. Grumbles Novak ""Why is America so robo-phobic?"" Despite a law forbidding machine-made police from patrolling our own streets hed like to see them protecting these United States. So would Raymond Sellers (Michael Keaton) CEO of the robot-manufacturing OmniCorp mainly because head analyst Jay Baruchel has calculated that theres a potential 600 billion market. And theyve found a loophole OmniCorp can win the hearts and minds of voters by putting the heart and mind of a human being inside a synthetic skeleton.Film Details RoboCop RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time108 min. More Info Trailer The setup is different in this update but the end goal is the same A good cop named Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) is doomed to be OmniCorps test case. Only this is a kinder gentler RoboCop. Its impossible not to be -- Verhoevens original was first rated X for extreme violence. He had to resubmit it 11 more times before the MPAA grudgingly gave it an R. Todays world is PG-13 the better to sell tickets to teen boys which means Murphy no longer loses his body in a brutal limb-shredding hail of gunfire but in a tasteful car bomb. We hear that Murphys lost an arm a leg an eye and 80 percent of his skin but we dont actually have to see him flayed open like Jesus of Michigan.Padilha and screenwriter Joshua Zetumer have shifted the stakes. Where Verhoeven a Dutch director just beginning his English-language career seized the chance to make a satire about gas-guzzling ultraviolent Americans Padilha a Brazilian director also starting his English-language career after the excellent Rio police corruption flicks Elite Squad and Elite Squad 2 wants to play nice. Instead of a nightmarish dystopian Detroit this RoboCop feels like it could take place in a not-too-bad tomorrow. What scares us in 2014 isnt that we could someday make a robot Murphy. Its that we probably already can. And will even though we dont need to. Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat. Sep. 10 1200pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On the CW Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm The twist of the reboot is that scientist Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman the go-to for guilt-ridden geniuses) is too good at engineering a conscience into his creation. Mechanized Murphy isnt a memory-wiped baby food-eating monstrosity. Hes a real man or at least the brain lungs and larynx of a real man with a personality a life and a wife (Abbie Cornish) who signed the release papers permitting OmniCorp to rebuild her husband. (In a sly dig hes now manufactured in China.)If only this genteel RoboCop dared to include a frank talk about whether they could weld in a flip-up Hitachi Magic Wand. But Padilha doesnt want to bother with jokes. What really interests him is watching OmniCorps marketing strategists take a product I mean person who works and then chip away at the man inside in order to sell him better. The horror of Murphys robotization happens in slow motion. If his human empathy makes a rescue op take half a minute longer shave it down. If he gets emotional adjust his dopamine. If hes tracking as too lovable paint him black. Incrementally Murphy is stripped of conscience free will and hormones until hes reduced to a flatlined android. Hes no longer limited by technology -- hes limited by focus groups.Weve swapped out body horror for mental anguish Verhoevens macabre sci-fi opera for Padilhas clear-eyed cautionary tale. But Kinnaman so great as a shady underestimated cop in The Killing cant quite channel Murphys agony. Ironically its the blankness of Peter Wellers original RoboCop that made him effective. We could ascribe emotions to him and Wellers monotone delivery gave his quips a droll kick (also the secret to Arnold Schwarzeneggers 80s success). Kinnaman can act more but it resonates less. We need to be horrified by him or for him. Instead we just like him. And thats not enough.In fact thats the problem with the whole film. Every bit of it is more advanced The actors are better the plot is tighter the special effects sleeker the messages more heartfelt. Yet it lacks Verhoevens bloody biting scream. If OmniCorps frustration with Murphy is that he was too uncontrollably human this RoboCop proves the point double. Its an entertaining enough film one that wed applaud politely if it existed in a vacuum. Its a feat of Hollywood engineering. But its soul is missing.3 Photo by Kerry Hayes - (c) 2013 Columbia Pictures/MGM Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke? NEXT Contact Amy Nicholson Follow L.A.

Photo Credit AP / Kerry Hayes advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT In the near future a critically injured cop is brought back to life as a cyborg. Rated PG-13. BOTTOM LINE An overelaborate and unsatisfying remake of the 1987 pulp masterpiece with more heady dialogue than bloody shootouts. CAST Joel Kinnaman Gary Oldman Abbie Cornish LENGTH 158 RoboCop"" Paul Verhoevens 1987 film about a bullet-riddled Detroit cop Murphy (Peter Weller) who is reborn as a corporate-controlled peacekeeping cyborg remains a brilliant piece of lowbrow filmmaking. Outrageously violent wickedly satirical and eerily prescient ""RoboCop"" presented a series of grim jokes that have basically come to pass Ubiquitous surveillance and unmanned military machines? Hilarious Whats more it was a great example of visual storytelling -- little talk lots of action. A remake attempts to elaborate and expound upon (and occasionally update) the original turning what were once short scenes into subplots and full-blown back stories. In this telling we delve into the wounded core of Murphy (Joel Kinnaman a lanky soulful Swedish-American actor) whose humanity is disappearing into his computer-powered robo-suit. ""Consciousness is nothing more than the processing of information"" says his Frankensteinian creator Dr. Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman). Meanwhile Murphys wife and son (Abbie Cornish and John Paul Ruttan) feel abandoned while the guys who ordered Murphys murder are still free. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Its all rather surprisingly well acted (Kinnaman and Oldman are better than they even need to be) but ""RoboCop"" is missing a crucial ingredient fun. Michael Keaton adds some spark as OmniCorp CEO Raymond Sellars whose black jeans suggest an evil Steve Jobs while Samuel L. Jackson provides amusing if off-target cultural critique as Foxish television bloviator Pat Novak. But director Jose Padilha (the gripping Brazilian documentary ""Bus 174"") spends so much time exploring philosophical dilemmas that he forgets to include the gleeful brutality and wild shootouts that made the 1987 film such a thrill. The vote-by-vote fate of a Senate bill outlawing robots isnt exactly a heart-pumping moment. Another thing the new ""RoboCop"" cant do is seem relevant. An opening scene set in the Middle East plus a closing speech about the future of drone warfare address current events without making any clear point. Mostly ""RoboCop"" overthinks the original film and ends up blowing its circuits.

"Review This RoboCop model could use a recall - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review This RoboCop model could use a recall RoboCop Kerry Hayes / Columbia Pictures Joel Kinnaman left and Gary Oldman star in ""RoboCop."" Joel Kinnaman left and Gary Oldman star in ""RoboCop."" (Kerry Hayes / Columbia Pictures) Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic In the 27 years since ""RoboCop"" first rocked the movie world much has happened and apparently the filmmakers behind this years remake didnt get the memo. A straight-up old-school bot-man morph isnt quite so spectacular with ""Transformers"" ""Terminators"" ""Avatar"" and all-things Xbox over-populating the action landscape. (Not to mention superheroes galore.)To put it bluntly ""RoboCop"" the movie and the man seem a little dazed and confused. The re-imagined crime action sci-fi thriller isnt going for the biting satire of Paul Verhoevens 1987 original or its extreme violence. The sci-fi side hasnt evolved much. And the thrill? Well most of the thrill is gone.PHOTOS Best films of 2013 | Betsy Sharkey Which does raise the question Why? Beyond that Hollywood dream of fabulous franchise riches why bother?The reboot does have some things going for it starting with Swedens brooding heartthrob Joel Kinnaman (best known here for his spade work in ""The Killing""). His chiseled cheeks are an excellent match for Robo a.k.a. Detroit detective Alex Murphy. You really cannot underestimate the importance of good bone structure and an icy stare in pulling off this role.Meanwhile Michael Keaton playing scheming business titan Raymond Sellars is deftly duplicitous. Gary Oldman is excellent as good doc/bad doc Norton who uses Murphy as a human guinea pig. Abbie Cornish is ideal as the sexy spouse standing by her reconstituted man. And Jackie Earle Haley is a scene stealer as the insult-slinging robot handler. Of course all those zingers he aims at the hardware are really for our amusement.Guns and explosions are blazing from the beginning as bodies drop and dilemmas develop inside the raucous action that Brazilian director Jose Padilha is known for. See his 2007 ""Elite Squad"" for a sample of some powerful pyro. But ""RoboCops"" bodies mainly drop to the ground in stylized silhouettes. There is no real sense of violence per se though the before-and-after shots of Murphy do suggest some major pain. RELATED Seven biggest movie stories of 2013Not nearly soon enough the theater is awash in the reverb of that signature sound of heavy Robo feet pounding the pavement -- wamp wamp wamp. Yet instead of ""power"" and ""unstoppable"" ""leaden"" and ""slightly sluggish"" come to mind.In part the sensation is because of the films inner struggle -- not the soul-versus-machine conundrum that faces Murphy though that is there too. Rather it is the sound of an above-average script by Joshua Zetumer and the co-writers of the first ""RoboCop"" Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner fighting to gain traction against the action. The director cant decide which to favor either.The jabs at corporate malfeasance and the power of cable pundits are particularly sharp. The film begins with the pot-stirring political commentator Pat Novak (Samuel L. Jackson) using the bully pulpit of his nightly TV show to praise the power of OmniCorps robot technology to police the rest of the world and decry Congress for keeping it off American soil.The show cuts between Novaks stinging barbs debating legislators and footage of a live segment with Omnis bots in action in Tehran. A suicide bombing during the telecast threatens to tank Sellars Beltway efforts to put his robots on the streets of cities like Detroit. This drives the films ethical moral and scientific debate in fairly predictable ways.By the way the film takes place in 2028 just 14 years in the future and for those worried about Detroits long-term prognosis ""RoboCop"" comes as a relief. The city has not only emerged from bankruptcy it is a big shiny metropolis. Conveniently the crime problems remain.PHOTOS Best films of 2013 | Kenneth TuranAt this point in the film the ""why bother"" question has shifted to ""where the heck is RoboCop?""Patience were not there yet.Theres some before-business to fill out Murphys undercover cop story and how he finds himself in need of Dr. Nortons expertise. And there are a few OmniCorp boardroom powwows that might be deadly if not for Jay Baruchel who is very funny as the marketing whiz wielding all the focus group data.At long last Murphy is given something of a second chance. But the rather old-fashioned mechanized life the director envisioned doesnt do much for the movie.Robo rides a speedy souped-up motorcycle through crowded city streets. Yawn. Hes got a lot of firepower at his fingertips and a souped-up brain that displays stuff he thinks on screen. OK.Meanwhile Norton keeps tinkering with Murphys dopamine which any second-grader knows isnt fair. Stakes rise bad guys are uncovered Robo is resilient but probably needs therapy.Although the movie isnt a complete disaster its not your fathers ""RoboCop"" either.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com------------------------------------RoboCopMPAA rating PG-13 for intense sequences of action including frenetic gun violence throughout brief strong language sensuality and some drug materialRunning time 1 hour 57 minutes Playing In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Reviews The Killing (movie) Samuel L.

Lets imagine that this years remake of ""RoboCop"" coupled with 2012s take on ""Total Recall"" exist unto themselves in something of a pop-culture vacuum devoid of the considerable legacy of Paul Verhoevens bloody brazen predecessors and yet still standing as recent examples of big-budget effects-driven sci-fi. As directed by Len Wiseman the latter reveals itself to be an equally painless and brainless dose of forgettable flash while Jose Padilhas effort at least offers something resembling ideas of morality and mortality in the guise of a silly shoot-em-up even if those ideas are eventually given short shrift. Its the year 2028 and OmniCorp CEO Ray Sellars (Michael Keaton) is trying to turn the public tide against legislation which forbids his companys robotic forces from providing potentially lucrative security Stateside much as they have pacified citizens abroad. With the reluctant help of Dr. Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman) Sellars solution is to put a man in the machine and once a car bomb leaves severely scarred Detroit cop Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) in a coma distraught wife Clara (Abbie Cornish always crying) allows OmniCorp to resurrect Alex as a crime-fighting cyborg with a PR-friendly face and ostensibly the critical conscience that drones lack. From that point on Murphy is a one-man army against the scum of the streets whenever his lingering emotional trauma isnt battling OmniCorps very deliberate programming protocols and deep-seated corruption from within his own ranks. However just when the stakes should be escalating the story downshifts from potentially ripe political satire -- were shown segments from ""The Novak Element"" a plainly biased news program hosted with suitably wide-eyed fervor by Samuel L. Jackson -- to equally repetitive police procedural business and sentimental family reunion drama. Worse yet the second hours promise of a little less conversation and a little more action is undone by the inevitable bloodlessness of PG-13 shootouts whether they consist of frenetic simulations involving other robots assaults by arms dealers rendered in almost complete darkness or rubbery feats of digitally rendered derring-do. Regardless of sheer viscera the action beats in director Padilhas earlier ""Elite Squad"" films proved consistently exciting and well-orchestrated; here leave it to an eerily clinical reveal of our heros remaining organs stripped of their jet-black Batman-like trappings to prove more stomach-churning than a single showdown against generally bland easily tazed villains. Thankfully the corporate ranks are a bit more colorful with Keaton an endearingly slimy figurehead Oldman his morally conflicted colleague and Jackie Earle Haley putting in a welcome effort as a puritanical OmniCorp technician opposed to the whole RoboCop gambit from the get-go. (Meanwhile the reliably talented Jay Baruchel Jennifer Ehle and Michael K. Williams all but watch the proceedings from the sidelines.) That leaves Kinnaman whose noble pursuit of justice by any means necessary often translates to a regrettable stoicism even before his emotions are chemically dialed down and in turn what should be a battle for the soul of a man a city and a nation falls by the wayside amid so many other agendas and in-jokes. Its not hard to see the piecemeal soldier as the ideal metaphor for his own costly-yet-conflicted starring vehicle questionably effective in its mission to entertain and often at tonal odds with itself. ""RoboCop"" has sound and fury to spare and even an inspired idea or two lurking beneath that polished exterior but much like its upgraded namesake this watchable mess ultimately lacks a prime directive to call its own.

(AP Photo/Columbia Pictures - Sony Kerry Hayes) Kerry Hayes This image released by Columbia Pictures shows Joel Kinnaman left and Abblie Cornish in a scene from ""RoboCop."" (AP Photo/Columbia Pictures - Sony Kerry Hayes) When the original ""RoboCop"" was released in 1987 the notion of a half-man/half-machine law enforcer was so far-fetched that the movie functioned as a satire of action films and a critique of urban paranoia.A quarter-century later big-city cops are cloaked in battle armor carry laser-aided assault rifles and dont need a warrant to sort through your data. So a faithful remake of ""RoboCop"" would be timely. Instead the producers of this new version have retreated back to the lab concocting a creaky hybrid of ""Frankenstein"" and ""Call of Duty.""The setting is America is the near future. The opening scene in which a conservative pundit played by Samuel L. Jackson applauds the use of robots to pacify the people of Iran is a sly send-up of infotainment propaganda; but the rest of the movie lacks the same social awareness and comedic bite. In Detroit Omnicorp CEO Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton) is scheming to unleash cyber-goons on American streets. But because Congress and the public have raised questions about the morality of robots Sellars seeks an incapacitated police officer to inhabit a mechanical suit. He finds the perfect candidate after undercover cop Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) loses an arm a leg and an eye to a car bombing.While Alex is in a coma his wife Clara (Abbie Cornish) agrees to the freakish procedure. He awakens in a Chinese research facility with little more than a head a spine and lungs inside a weaponized suit. But with the help of kindly Dr. Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman) Alex is able to control the technology and his conflicted emotions. But the latter requires that he be chemically altered and when Alex is set loose in Detroit he becomes a remorseless crime-fighter. Unfortunately the movie doesnt conjure a sense of a crime-ridden city or a scared populace that is clamoring for justice. Worse because Swedish actor Kinnaman is so inexpressive to begin with we dont have an emotional investment when he starts to yearn for his old life as a husband and father.Compared to the humor in the ""Iron Man"" movies or the vigilante themes in the recent ""Batman"" series this reboot has little to offer. While it aims for the mechanized mayhem of the ""Terminator"" franchise the video-game violence in this PG-13 flick never reaches the level of a guilty pleasure.Ultimately this movie about a tin man who lacks a heart brains and courage.Rating PG-13  Run time 148  Content Intense sequences of action and gun violence some strong language and brief sensuality Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

(Kerry Hayes/Kerry Hayes) By Ann Hornaday February 11 2014 Follow AnnHornaday ""RoboCop"" the 1987 action satire directed by Paul Verhoeven was one of the most cynically ingenious films of its era. It both exploited the aggressive aesthetic of 80s stars Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger and subtly mocked it all the while delivering prescient observations about Reagan-era privatization and corporate will to power. The original ""RoboCop"" was so good in fact that it counts as one of those films that doesnt need to be remade; on the other hand at a time when so many of the futuristic realities it posited have come to pass in the form of prosthetics drones and surveillance technology it couldnt be a better time to revisit and recast the films cardinal themes. Like Bob Dylan James Bond and ""Tonight Show"" hosts perhaps every era should get the ""RoboCop"" it deserves. In the hands of director Jose Padilha (""Bus 174"" ""Elite Squad"") the ""RoboCop"" of today manages to meet expectations without exceeding them. Lightly following the original story line by screenwriters Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner this iteration makes a few tweaks here and there hewing to the most recognizable contours but dispensing with the most hard-edged violence and gore. (This ""RoboCop"" has been retooled by screenwriter Joshua Zetumer.) Police officer Alex Murphy is still an upright Detroit cop battling crime on the streets and corruption inside his precinct; when an explosion takes his life he is whisked away by the bright and shiny company OmniCorp and reconfigured as a part-human cyborg the perfect melding of man and machine and an ideal marketing tool for selling Americans on the idea of robotic law enforcement. The Swedish actor Joel Kinnaman -- familiar to some viewers from his starring role on the AMC series ""The Killing"" -- plays Murphy with convincing melancholy and conviction. And when the visor comes down on his bionic body armor his lower face bears a striking resemblance to Peter Weller who so memorably originated the role. Padilha has assembled a supporting cast that conveys both the gravitas and parodic humor that intertwine through ""RoboCops"" singular DNA Michael Keaton projects equal parts menace and yuppie blandness as OmniCorp CEO Raymond Sellars; Gary Oldman is all apologies as Murphys benevolent Dr. Frankenstein Dennett Norton; Abbie Cornish delivers a solemn portrayal of Murphys confused wife; and Samuel L. Jackson pops up periodically as a goofy Greek chorus in the form of a bloviating TV pundit. All of the ingredients are there and as ""RoboCop"" opens -- with a scene of OmniCorp robots ""pacifying"" a neighborhood in Tehran -- it looks as if the movie will locate Murphy within a wider post-9/11 world and globalized economy a rich vein for the caustic satire for which the original was known. But with the exception of a terrific scene in which Murphy tries to escape OmniCorps testing facility in China Padilha ignores that opportunity. Even when the action gets back to Detroit he seems more interested in explosive (but largely bloodless) firefights heavy ordnance and cool-but-bland visual effects than sharp social commentary. Every action movie these days it seems has to end up as ""Transformers"" and Padilhas ""RoboCop"" is no exception. The action is incendiary frantic and ultimately enervating. Fans of the original movie will recognize some of its best lines (one of which is expertly delivered by Jackie Earl Haley as an OmniCorp minion) as well as Murphy classics wherein he delivers niceties and beat-cop jargon in a stiff robotic bark. For all its playfulness the new ""RoboCop"" cant help but lack the novelty of the originals jolting mixture of dumb-smart irony and visceral pulp. Despite Kinnamans sympathetic performance his 2.6 Billion Dollar Mans existential dilemma -- revolving around the question of whether emotion can override circuitry and programming -- never feels high-stakes. Presumably ""RoboCop"" like its cobbled-together protagonist is beginning life anew as yet another franchise. But it does so with much of its potential vaguely unrealized like one of Murphys phantom limbs. RoboCop   At area theaters. Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of action including frenetic gun violence throughout brief strong profanity sensuality and some drug material. 110 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

"RoboCop Review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies REVIEW RoboCop  Video Robocop delivers humanoids with great gas mileage Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips reviews ""Robocop."" (Posted on February 13 2014) Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips reviews ""Robocop."" (Posted on February 13 2014) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Intriguingly ambiguous in its rooting interests the ""RoboCop"" remake doesnt really believe its own poster. The tagline ""Crime has a new enemy"" suggests little more than point and shoot -- the same old cyborg song and dance. While nobodyd be dumb enough to reboot the original 1987 kill-em-up franchise by holding back on the scenes of slaughter in favor of sly political satire about arm-twisting Fox News jingoism or American business ethics Brazilian-born director Jose Padilha manages to do all that and still deliver the product.That first excitingly sadistic ""RoboCop"" directed by Paul Verhoeven paved the way for one of the ugliest-spirited sequels ever and a third forgettable outing. Now working from a script by Joshua Zetumer based on the Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner ur-text we have a movie taking place in the ever-popular near future 14 years hence. Were back in Detroit. Americas the lone squishy-liberal holdout among first-world nations in the crime-fighting revolution deploying deadly peacekeeping robots and robotics. The airwaves are ruled by a Bill OReilly-type show ""The Novak Element"" in which a paranoid visionary (Samuel L. Jackson in fantastic ""distinguished"" anchorman hair) shills for the OmniCorp company the money behind the armed robots. The company president (Michael Keaton) realizes the American public wont support robot police officers unless they can package them as human-ish. Joel Kinnaman of the television series ""The Killing"" plays Alex Murphy the Detroit police detective critically injured by a car bomb and reconfigured by Gary Oldmans kindly OmniCorp researcher into the franchise title at hand.Theres a lot to enjoy here though the brutality is very rough for a PG-13 rating. (The screening included an awful lot of clueless parents accompanied by an awful lot of preteens.) RoboCop becomes a pawn in the corporate game as he was in the original film but here the machinations and talk of focus groups and marketing strategies is more pronounced and pretty sharp. Most audiences will be content with the gamer-friendly set pieces in which a fatality count snuggles itself into the upper-right corner of the screen. Jackie Earle Haley plays the robot trainer/programmer and hes one of several ace supporting players lifting ""RoboCop"" above the routine. The female roles arent much but theyre not insulting and theyre handled with steely panache by Abbie Cornish (grieving confused wife since her husbands not technically dead) Marianne Jean-Baptiste (no-nonsense police chief) and the great Jennifer Ehle (icy business associate). The script includes some interesting ideas about the researchers struggling to get RoboCops medication doses at the right level so he retains enough of his human side to be relatable to the public. This is at heart a pretty sad movie. Verhoeven wouldnt be caught dead making you care about anything in his ""RoboCop""; Padilha is after something different.He shoots in a familiar shaky-cam style that might be called ""early NYPD Blue."" That I can do without. But unlike the recent empty-headed ""Total Recall"" remake for example this movie comes at you with an idea or two as well as every available gun blazing.mjphilllipstribune.com""RoboCop"" - 3 stars MPAA rating PG-13 (for intense sequences of action including frenetic gun violence throughout brief strong language sensuality and some drug material)Running time 156Opens Wednesday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Movies Entertainment Gun Control Personal Weapon Control Interior Policy Politics and Government PG-13 Rated Movies Latest movie reviews REVIEW About Last Night  1/2 REVIEW The Rocket  Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising75deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-robocop-review-0211-20140211,0,4456417.column",200,robocop(2014)21,robocop(2014),chicagotribune

Area theaters. Whose bright idea was this? The remake of the 1987 cult actioner ""Robocop"" is a misguided failure -- not only because its retooled half-man/half-machine hero now has emotions but also because its ""fear the machines"" message winds up feeling creaky. The new film like the original is set in a future Detroit and is basically the Frankenstein story in Transformers clothes. Gary Oldman handles the technology in RoboCop. (Kerry Hayes) But when things like Google Glass are inching us closer to becoming robo-citizens ourselves the notion of a ""Robocop"" feels canned from the start. Worse this Robocop is given a brain and a heart -- but somewhere on the assembly line they stole his guts. Joel Kinnaman suits up in Robocop. (Courtesy of Columbia Pictures an) In the year 2028 when a bombastic TV host (amped-up Samuel L. Jackson) sets the national mood the U.S. military uses robots as peacekeepers around the world. The OmniCorp company wants them on American streets too but folks worry that automatons cant relate to humans -- so greedy OmniCorp CEO Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton) aims to put a wounded man inside a machine. Enter Detroit cop Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) whose investigation into departmental dirty dealings gets him blown up. OmniCorp hires conscientiously conflicted scientist Dr. Norton (Gary Oldman) to put Murphys shattered remains inside computerized armor. Now Sellars has a PR tool Norton has new funding and Murphy has a new life. Samuel L. Jackson is a TV host with an agenda in RoboCop. (Kerry Hayes) Except Murphy doesnt want to live as a hunk of meat in a shiny box. A few upgrades later hes fine-tuned enough to clean up the streets solve his own ""murder"" and visit his worried wife (Abbie Cornish) and young son. Instead of being filled with emotions though he has criminal files and protocol directives in his skull. The one improvement over director Paul Verhoevens original is that director Jose Padilhas creation doesnt lumber. Robocop still moves with whirrs and whump-whump footsteps but he also can run like Iron Man. Joel Kinnaman as the man-machine hybrid in Robocop (Kerry Hayes) However with his visor now retractable so we can see his face Kinnaman has to emote more that Peter Weller did in 87 and thats a mistake. Plus in his spiffy new black armor he looks like a Ralph Lauren-designed Navy frogman. As for Oldman hes reliably complex and Keaton is good as a restless corporate fiend (the ""Batman"" vets lower face could have taught Kinnamans jaw a thing or two about minimalist acting). But Jacksons character wears out his welcome as does Cornishs grieving widow. Much of the movies topical satire -- it targets drones profiling and media blowhards banging the war drum -- is mild yet Padilha undersells that as much as the sparse action set pieces. ""Robocop"" should be melted down for scrap. Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet ""Lets go with black"" the slimeball OmniCorp CEO (Michael Keaton) tells an underling commissioning a trendy darker color scheme for his crime-fighting creation. The man knows whats fashionable in a superhero--and so too does the creative team behind this slick new RoboCop whose greatest strength and most glaring weakness is that its not the old RoboCop. Just as its eponymous lawman loses some of himself in the mechanization process Jose Padilhas reboot sacrifices much of the personality--the savage humor the irreverent carnage--of Paul Verhoevens 1987 original. But when it comes to unnecessary remakes isnt different better? Padilha whose Elite Squad series did the cops-and-robbers genre right has made his own movie--slightly squarer and less subversive than the other one but also admirable in its refusal to simply replicate the circuitry of a blockbuster predecessor. The paintjob is where the alterations begin not where they end.While Verhoevens film took aim at the Reagan-era privatization of military might the 2014 model applies that anxiety to an age of automated assassination. (Drone warfare is the new target and unambiguously so.) The corporate bigwigs of this OmniCorp are much too PR-minded to allow one of their mechanical wonders to say gun down a yes-man during a board meeting. To put robotic peacekeepers on the streets of American cities the company has to change the hearts and minds of the citizens who are understandably apprehensive about a conscience-free droid having the power to decide who lives and who dies. What OmniCorp really needs is a man inside the machine. Enter fallen police officer Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman a suitably square-jawed replacement for Peter Weller) whose wife consents to letting the mad scientists resurrect her critically wounded husband as a metallic one-man SWAT team. For the full Nolan effect he zips around dystopian Detroit on a sleek motorcycle; receiving more than just threat analysis through his computerized visor the newly rechristened RoboCop also has an Iron Man-worthy database streaming into his brain. As for the whole humanity thing thats adjustable with the touch of a switch--though only to a point as the geek squad discovers when their tin man begins to investigate his own murder.In the satire department RoboCop 2.0 is pointed but rarely funny It leans heavily on Samuel L. Jackson popping in to bloviate as a Fox News-style pundit. The digital mayhem meanwhile is capably staged but lacks the visceral punch of the old Verhoeven ultraviolence. (Like Jay Baruchels nattering OmniCorp marketing wiz the suits at Sony are after mass appeal; theyve reprogrammed a gory genre classic into a PG-13 crowd-pleaser.) But this RoboCop earns its stripes mostly for the seriousness with which it treats its Frankenstein story. Kinnaman whos afforded a wider range of feeling and more fluctuating inflection than Weller was locates the tragedy of his characters predicament. What he and Padilha understand is that RoboCop is both cool and--on a deeper more philosophical level--pretty terrifying. The movies affecting highlight arrives early when Murphys conflicted doctor (Gary Oldman sterling as always) shows his lab experiment what he really looks like under all the moving parts. For a few minutes the full horror of this refurbished premise is brought to the forefront. To paraphrase one of the originals most famous lines--repurposed here as a wink to the faithful--wed buy more of that for a dollar.

Of course one of the bad guys snorted cocaine off the chests of hookers. Why wouldnt he? So now Jose Padilha has undertaken a remake -- and a PG-13-rated one at that. How could this possibly work? It doesnt not completely. But thanks to a good cast and a willingness to stray fairly far afield from the source material its better than you might think. The film which takes place in 2028 opens with a Fox News-like show called ""The Novak Element"" whose host played with gusto by Samuel L. Jackson bemoans the fact that every country in the world except the United States now uses robots as crime fighters (and crime deterrents). He shows his audience a live example from Tehran where drones and robots shake down the populace who cower in their presence. See? All safe Not exactly free although the energetic newscaster cant see the fear in peoples eyes and he assures us that all is hunky-dory. Until that is suicide bombers attack on live television. A giant corporation called OmniCorp makes the robots and drones and its CEO Raymond Sellers (Michael Keaton) is bent on cracking the U.S. market which will require changing laws. People dont want machines fighting crime he reasons. But they might accept a machine thats part man. Thats where Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) comes in. He is a Detroit police officer nearly killed by the drug lord (Patrick Garrow) he was chasing. About all thats left of him is his head his heart his lungs and his left arm. Sellers thinks hes the perfect candidate for his new product. He enlists the help of the brilliant Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman) who rebuilds Murphy. Unlike in the first film Murphys wife (Abbie Cornish) and son (John Paul Ruttan) still are an integral active part of his life at least at first. He obviously is a changed man in more ways than one. After his intensive retooling and rehabilitation he attempts to reconnect with them -- until Sellers realizes this might be bad for business. The acting is better than Joshua Zetumers script (Edward Neumier and Michael Miner who wrote the original also are credited). Kinnaman has a nice kind of early Keith Carradine vibe going on. And honestly its always a treat to see Oldman and Keaton no matter what theyre in. We dont see much of Keaton these days which is too bad. Oldmans character is a new addition to the story a scientist conflicted by wanting to push the limits of technology and the realization that he is essentially robbing a man of his humanity. Alas Cornish a terrific actress is mostly wasted. As the drug dealer Garrow seems interesting in the small amount of time he appears on-screen. Jackie Earle Haley has fun as the head of OmniCorp security. He and his bad attitude are in fact the only vestiges of humor that were so prevalent in the original. It needed some laughs because when you melt a guys face in one scene you probably need a commercial for a car called the 6000 SUX in another. Padilha plays it straight (with the exception of Jacksons welcome appearances). He could have used some humor too. But against seemingly steep odds a new ""RoboCop"" is if not completely necessary at least certainly worthwhile. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

(KERRY HAYES)By Steven Rea Inquirer Movie CriticPosted February 12 2014In the year 2028 which is when the new RoboCop takes place Detroit is bankruptcy-free looking good. OmniCorp a giant global concern that makes drones and military machines has planted its sleek skyscraping HQ in the heart of downtown. And while there is still plenty of crime the city has top-flight detectives on the force to keep the bad guys at bay like Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) who looks and talks like that Holder fellow from AMCs The Killing. (He is.)But just like the first Murphy the one played by Peter Weller in Paul Verhoevens groundbreaking 1987 sci-fi hit this one comes to a nasty end - a car bomb that leaves him burnt to a crisp with a severed spine and no hope really of living on.Except that the CEO of OmniCorp - a cold and cultured fellow (he has a Francis Bacon triptych on his office wall) played with a cold cultured smirk by Michael Keaton - has an idea.""Were going to put a man inside a machine"" says Raymond Sellars to his top scientist Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman). And so the titular crime-fighting cyborg is reborn and rebooted to sell a wary American public on law enforcement automatons that will keep the streets safe and keep police officers out of harms way.Whats left of Murphy is fused with a billion-dollar humanoid chassis - his face and one flesh-and-blood hand encased in almost indestructible alloy his actions controlled and enhanced by computers - but in theory his consciousness still his own.Directed in gritty jumpy B-movie strokes by JosA(c) Padilha ( Elite Squad) with Joshua Zetumer significantly working over the originals screenplay RoboCop is a solid near-future action pic that poses moral questions about artificial intelligence and remote-control combat systems without getting too preachy or ponderous about it.Where Verhoevens RoboCop exploited audiences anxieties about crime and urban decay Padilhas version considers how the human psyche fits into an increasingly automated world and how ethics and emotion figure in the new equation. Of course it explores all this using fusillades of firepower thumping robots and cool CG effects.Kinnaman brings a Frankensteins-monster melancholy to his portrayal while Abbie Cornish does her best to give the anguished-spouse role a bit of depth - she and her husband had a good marriage and a son they loved until everything went kaboom. Oldman is terrific as the not-quite-mad scientist all too willing to compromise his principles while Jackie Earle Haley (as an OmniCorp henchman) The Wires Michael K. Williams (as Murphys detective partner) and Samuel L. Jackson (bookending the film as an ultra-conservative TV talk show host) add some actorly sturm und drang to all the slam and bang.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 1149 a.m. EST February 14 2014Not even a flashy new robo-suit can spruce up this poorly paced and lifeless remake.Joel Kinnaman takes on the role of cyborg law enforcement officer Alex Murphy in the reboot of Robocop.(Photo Columbia Pictures)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY review   out of fourStars Joel Kinnaman Gary Oldman Michael Keaton Abbie Cornish Samuel L. Jackson Michael K. WilliamsRated PG-13; running time 1 hour 48 minutes; opens Wednesday nationwideIn what is Hollywoods least-original week of offerings in ages RoboCop kicks off a trio of remakes with a resounding thud.Updated versions of About Last Night and Endless Love land on Friday and might offer a decent alternative but for now moviegoers are stuck with this sci-fi thrillers bland story murky cinematography and frenetic special effects (  out of four; rated PG-13; opens Wednesday nationwide).The 1987 original was a smart satire of American culture. Though this Robo reboot resonates to some degree with its depiction of military drone strikes the film sidesteps deeper questions about the intersection of technology law enforcement and politics.Its now 2028 and a multinational corporation unimaginatively named OmniCorp is raking in billions of dollars from sales of militarized robotic drones used overseas. Americans resist the notion of drone-led policing within their borders but fanatical law-and-order TV personality Pat Novak (Samuel L. Jackson) is pushing the agenda as are some politicians.STORY RoboCop gets rebooted for a modern worldMORE Three RoboCop nods to the 80s originalREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersThe film opens promisingly with Novak and a cut to drones in action in Iran. Jackson is the only cast member who approaches his role with a measure of zeal. But too soon any sense of fun gives way to mind-numbing explosions.OmniCorps nefarious CEO Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton) deploys his malevolent robot trainer Rick Mattox (Jackie Earle Haley) to come up with a plan to introduce policing killbots to the USA. The idea is to put a recognizable face atop the robo-bod. The medical researcher tasked to carry it out is Dr. Dennett Norton(Gary Oldman).Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare In RoboCop the powers that be thought they had created the perfect crime fighter part man mostly machine. They thought they could control him. They were wrong. VPCThe experimental subject chosen is Detroit police detective Alex Murphy (The Killings Joel Kinnaman) a dedicated cop loving husband and doting father who has been severely burned and maimed in a bomb blast. Murphy wakes up three months later as a cyborg encased in a stainless-steel suit. He takes it better than most. But maybe thats because hes fine-tuned to drum out those pesky human emotions that would render him less efficient than full robots.All thats left of Murphy is his head one hand and a pair of lungs. The rest is streamlined metal. Throughout his first training exercise Mattox cruelly insists on playing If I Only Had a Heart from The Wizard of Oz.Thats pretty much it for humor. Not only does this RoboCop lack heart its witless and plodding. Murphy/RoboCop tromps around thunderously and emits a metal scraping sound that could have benefited from the Tin Mans oil can. If scientists could fashion such a high-tech man/machine youd think they could enable him to move without creaking and thudding.Despite improvements in visual effects in the years since the original film a climactic action scene is hampered by cloaking the goings-on in darkness and bathing movements in an infrared glow as seen through RoboCops goggles.The remake takes a wan stab at timeliness and attempts a feeble skewering of U.S. foreign policy. Mostly however the story has a dull melodramatic arc that focuses on Murphy reconnecting with his wife Clara (Abbie Cornish) and young son and going after the organized-crime thugs who nearly killed him. Kinnaman a Swedish-born actor who is far better than this material has the tough job of fleshing out an underwritten character. Were meant to understand that you cant squelch humanity even when its reconfigured as a machine. But humanity seems far too expendable given the many faceless people blown up during overly long action sequences.Like its shell of an enforcer this Robo-redo is slick but tedious flat-footed and humorless. 95 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDIN 10 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1eoj6mW",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/02/11/robocop-review/4984605/,200,robocop(2014)29,robocop(2014),usatoday
"RoboCop remake clanks where it ought to purr review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesRoboCop remake clanks where it ought to purr reviewStar-studded 2014 RoboCop remake should be a sleeker ride than its 1987 predecessor yet it clanks where it ought to purr. Its a clear case of overthinking and under-delivering an idea.Marianne Jean-Baptiste and Joel Kinnaman in a scene from the remake of RoboCop. Theres too much talk and not enough action Peter Howell says.  (Columbia Pictures)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticTues. Feb. 11 2014RoboCopStarring Joel Kinnaman Gary Oldman Samuel L. Jackson Michael Keaton Abbie Cornish Jackie Earle Haley and Jay Baruchel. Directed by Jose Padilha. Opens Feb. 12 at GTA theatres. 110 minutes. PG The revamped RoboCop has a lot in common with the Ford Edsel historys most notorious automotive misfire.The film must have looked good on the drawing board just as the Edsel promised to be an ""entirely new kind of car"" in the late 1950s.Article Continued BelowInstead of just aping the violent satire of Paul Verhoevens 1987 cult sci-fi classic which has aged surprisingly well remake director Jose Padilha (Elite Squad) sought to put more humanity into this man-machine melding. He enlisted some very good name actors among them Gary Oldman Michael Keaton Abbie Cornish Jackie Earle Haley Samuel L. Jackson and Jay Baruchel a departure from the relative unknowns of the original. Joshua Zetumers screenplay shades in character and plot details that were mere sketches in Verhoevens version co-written by Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner which simply leaped over logic gaps.So RoboCop 2014 should by rights be a sleeker ride than its 1987 predecessor yet it clanks where it ought to purr. Its a clear case of overthinking and under-delivering an idea much like that infamous failed Ford. In other words its a retooling that didnt need to be done.The essential story remains pushed to 2028 from the previous mid-1990s setting but still set in a blighted Detroit. Instead of smarmy newscasters grinning through reports of global carnage we get Jackson as a Rush Limbaugh-style TV reactionary slamming America for failing to embrace robot cops and soldiers the way the rest of world has. Congress doesnt think Americans will accept mechanized peacekeepers on U.S. soil.Its an embarrassment for homegrown tech giant Omnicorp run by ambitious CEO Raymond Sellars (Keaton). He needs to prove his products in the homeland and he tasks his top scientist (Oldman) military trainer (Haley) and marketer (Baruchel) with making it happen.Opportunity comes knocking when brave young Detroit cop Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman of TVs The Killing) falls prey to a vengeful car bomb set by the stooges of local crime lord Antoine Vallon (Patrick Garrow) who has friends in both high and low places.Not much remains of Murphy -- his head chest and a hand -- but its enough to strap into a robotic exoskeleton (made sleeker and more colourful than before) and to sell him to America as a mechanized lawman with a human brain a perfect compromise. The newly christened RoboCop might also still possess a conscience soul and empathy human attributes that could make him less lethal on the battlefield. As the trainer indelicately puts it ""Sticking organics in the system is a huge step backwards.""This is the stuff of interesting drama which Verhoeven exploited to the hilt with a straightforward and ultraviolent scenario of conflicted good guys versus truly evil bad guys. The original RoboCop was so gory it earned the rare U.S. ""X"" rating (now NC-17) mainly due to its blood lust.There was a rude logic to Verhoevens vision because it was a really grim story that both satirized and eulogized the bullet-ridden American Dream. The almost laugh-free remake sands off all the rough edges to achieve its tamer (yet potentially more profitable) PG-13 rating stateside -- PG in Ontario. We now see people standing around a lot talking (and talking) about the ethics of biomechanics and fussing over family and business matters rather than just setting RoboCop loose to blast away.When our man-machine does finally get in high gear excessive camera shake and clumsy choreography renders most of the action scenes unsatisfying. Advances in CGI and the IMAX screen do little to improve on the 1980s. Theres no single moment as good as the one in the original film where RoboCop tricks a crablike ED-209 killing machine to tumble down a flight of metal stairs.And speaking of those ED-209s who have a much bigger role in the remake it prompts feelings of nostalgia to see them looking and acting as dumb and lethal as they did in Verhoevens film.Saved from an unnecessary update and character adjustment they can keep right on being as mindlessly violent as before. Theyre an object lesson for all such films pass the popcorn and spare the sermons.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Related links By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 742pm on Tuesday Feb. 11 2014 Tuesday Feb. 11 2014 Sunday Feb. 16 2014 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Dutch director Paul Verhoevens original 1987 RoboCop in which man was merged with machine to fight lawlessness was a savvy slice of science fiction that not only tapped into the eras fear of crime but also gave viewers a neat send-up of corporate connivance and media manipulation.Almost 30 years later hotshot Brazilian director Jose Padilha kicks the story into the 21st century and his cacophonous pummelling remake is nothing if not current. The clever pre-title sequence in which a loudmouth 2028 TV talk show host Pat Novak (Samuel L. Jackson) takes us to a U.S.-occupied Iran to show how drones and robots control the population feels as contemporary as a CNN news bulletin.Its unfortunate then that this RoboCop reboot shrugs off the pointed satire too soon devolving into just another big action vehicle -- even if its a well-made entertaining one at times.Swedish actor Joel Kinnaman ( The Killing) is Alex Murphy a Detroit undercover cop who goes off on a renegade operation against a local crime lord Antoine Vallon (Patrick Garrow). It turns into a fiasco with Murphys partner (Michael K. Williams Boardwalk Empire) getting seriously injured and Vallon seeking revenge against Murphy. It comes in the middle of the night in the form of a car bomb that turns the husband and father into barely breathing scraps of human flesh.But his near-death provides an opportunity for Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton) the head of OmniCorp the robotics company that manufactures those metal warriors on patrol in Iran. Much to Sellars and Novaks angry dismay the U.S. Senate will not allow robots or drones to act as police on this side of the Atlantic because they lack such human traits as compassion or guilt. But if a robots unerring reflexes could be combined with Murphys sense of justice and fair play Sellars might be able to convince reluctant politicians and the public that America is indeed ready for robot rule on the streets. Besides Murphy gets a new superhuman body in the process. Its a win-win.Enter Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman) the new-age Dr. Frankenstein tasked with melding the soul and the silicon into a street-fighting machine. In a test -- set cheekily to the 1971 hit Hocus Pocus by the Dutch band Focus (a tip of the hat to Verhoeven?) -- Alex outmaneuvers and outguns the real robots proving he is in fact the best of both worlds. That is until he starts thinking too much for himself.This version of RoboCop written by Joshua Zetumer not only abandons its topicality about government surveillance and war but also loses its sense of place. Set in Detroit theres none of the urban decay or human distress that might serve as a believable backdrop for this new-generation man of steel. Instead it concentrates on the personal as Alex goes after Vallon and others whove done him wrong while still clinging to images of his wife (Abbie Cornish) and young son (John Paul Ruttan). The result is a RoboCop 2.0 that has less bite and sly subversion than the original.Padilha who came to the U.S. on the strength of his Brazilian action films Elite Squad and Elite Squad The Enemy Within (the highest-grossing film in his countrys history) directs with a sure hand and the occasional welcome sense of humor (in addition to the Focus song theres the Tin Mans If I Only Had a Heart from The Wizard of Oz and a nice riff on the memorable ""Ill buy that for a dollar"" line from the first film).But he fails to deliver a compelling new twist on the invincible lawman automaton and in the end its the talented young director who falls victim to the Hollywood machine.

Starring Joel Kinnaman Douglas Urbanski and Abbie Cornish. Directed by Jose Padilha. (PG-13. 118 minutes.) ""RoboCop"" is no canned remake of the 1987 action film. Its a reimagining that responds to everything that has changed in American life over the past 27 years addressing new threats and exploiting new anxieties. Its not a somber movie but its dead serious in its intent using fantasy to present audiences with a cautionary glimpse of where modern life may be heading. The original ""RoboCop"" was about crime with hints of a dystopian future involving big business and corrupt politicians and yet the misdeeds were small scale. This time everything is at stake and everything is thrown into the pot The movie is implicit commentary about the use of drones about that nature and future of being human and about the proper role of the United States in the world. Actually President Eisenhower might have liked ""RoboCop"" because its villain is the same as his - the military-industrial complex. You know this is not your fathers ""RoboCop"" from the first scene set in the near future A bloviating flag-waving talk show host (Samuel Jackson) is running live footage of the U.S. occupying force in Tehran as monstrous unmanned machines roll down the street killing people and destroying buildings. As this happens a pretty blond reporter on the scene enthuses into the camera about how ""in sunny Tehran the locals have embraced security as a top priority"" Related Stories RoboCop reboot full of big ideas Does Robocop reboot hit its mark? But the talk show hosts point is not just to celebrate Operation Freedom Tehran but to promote the use of unmanned drones in the United States for the war on crime. This is pretty pointed satire because in 2014 there really are Americans this crazy and they all seem to have TV shows. And so before the credits even roll we understand that ""RoboCop"" is intended as a warning to citizens who otherwise might be persuaded to sacrifice their freedom their privacy and even their humanity on the thin promise of ""safety."" After such an opening the challenge of ""RoboCop"" is to tell a personal story grounded in the characters that can at the same time open up and take on the weight of those big themes. We meet Murphy an honest and driven cop who is just one step away from uncovering a nest of corruption within the police department. Joel Kinnaman who plays Murphy has an interesting look for the role Hes tall and thin with rough big features that might belong to a villain or to a visionary but not to a conventional action hero. When Murphy is maimed and dismembered by a car bomb the evil Omnicorp - which manufactures robot policemen - gives him a new body and a huge publicity push in the hope of swaying the public toward the robot program. In ""RoboCop"" nothing seems easier than swaying public opinion. Just give people an emotional hook and a few nice-sounding arguments and count on their limited attention spans to do the rest. ""RoboCop"" a loose adaptation and elaboration of the original is the first produced screenplay of Joshua Zetumer who puts big ideas into play and - without hammering on them too hard - brings it all home by the finish. He finds an able director in Jose Padilha who concentrates on the performances as well as the action. As RoboCops wife Abbie Cornish carries much of the movies emotion. Gary Oldman as the scientist who engineers Murphys transformation embodies the storys ethical dilemma. And Michael Keaton as the greedy president of Omnicorp gives the audience something to root against. Keaton whom we dont see nearly enough is particularly interesting because he doesnt look or act like a villain and plays a character who almost certainly doesnt see himself that way. His clothes are neat and casual his manner is approachable and engaging and because hes played by Keaton he has a hyperactive quality thats the furthest thing from repellent. But if he gets his way life will become unlivable except perhaps for millionaires. Or billionaires. Its an admirable thing when a movie that could have found an audience just on the basis of its concept turns out to be creative and compelling. Its better still though a big surprise to see it take the temperature of the times. ""RoboCop"" depicts humanity under siege and wants us to believe that theres something pure and ineradicable about being human. Its about human nature and machine-nature at war within one soul with the implicit idea that his struggle is also the worlds. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

To read the whole story subscribe to BostonGlobe.com ROBOCOP Share Comment Paul Verhoevens ""Robocop"" was plenty ahead of its time in 1987 but the new remake directed without much zest by Brazils Jose Padilha is content to simply be of its time. Set a few steps into tomorrow it opens with a scene of US Army robo-warriors ""pacifying"" the people of Tehran and closes with a satiric pro-drone warfare speech delivered by a strutting Samuel L. Jackson. In between those pointed bookends the movie is business as usual An acceptably muscle-bound B-movie whose few fresh plot twists and solid supporting cast (Michael Keaton Gary Oldman) are drowned out by dull action choreography and a flavorless lead actor (Joel Kinnaman). But the film doesnt embarrass itself or dishonor its predecessor which is something. Full story for BostonGlobe.com subscribers.

My 80s-bred heart shudders at the idea of a contemporary filmmaker trying to mimic Paul Verhoevens smart splattery pulp and social satire (and expert use of Dallas futuristic architecture). Cant be done no use in trying.Instead we get a competent re-imagining that trades the originals garish charm for moral shades of gray and the usual action blockbuster noise. Lets face it; this could have been a soulless unmitigated disaster of an action knockoff. The fact that it never sinks to that level seems like at least a moral victory if youre into that sort of thing.Our new crime fighter is played by Swedish actor Joel Kinnaman (The Killing) who brings a likable Scandinavian reserve to the digitized pyrotechnics and overly busy plot. All but dead after a Detroit drug lord zaps him with a car bomb Officer Murphy finds himself robotized and reborn at the hands of two unlikely allies a corporate schemer (Michael Keaton) with military connections and a visionary doctor (Gary Oldman) who specializes in robotics.This might be a good time to ask a question Has Oldman ever given a bad performance? His effortless conjuring of emotional ambiguities has a way of classing up whatever joint he enters. His Dr. Norton is a bundle of sympathetic contradictions ambition ethics altruism opportunism. He doesnt even need whatever complexity the screenplay has provided him. He carries his own.Director Jose Padilha proves a bit too fond of dramatic close-ups which have a way of losing their drama the more often theyre used. His action sequences sanitized for the PG-13 rating feel pretty standard for our age of maximum volume and velocity. But the ubiquitous digital effects particularly those used in the medical science sequences actually carry a touch of wow and even a dash of humor.Speaking of which RoboCop 2.0 makes only passing attempts to wring a laugh or two from its lightly dystopian premise. A few come courtesy of Samuel L. Jackson as a bloviating hyperpatriotic cable news gasbag (best Jackson hair since Jackie Brown). Overall however this is a pretty straight-faced affair.After a while RoboCop writes itself into a corner; a few too many moving parts muck up the movies logic especially down the stretch. But I didnt mind too much. I like the way the movie plays with Murphys existential dilemma -- man machine or both? -- and the way that dilemma feeds RoboCops larger questions of medical ethics and that good ol military-industrial complex.I wouldnt quite call it a thinking mans action movie but it at least makes some game passes at actual ideas and stays pretty entertaining all the while (though the depiction of a crime-ridden Detroit is a bit tepid as if the filmmakers were afraid to offend the citys chamber of commerce).Was a new RoboCop necessary? Of course not. But the results could have been so much worse. With the exception of a few cursory nods to its predecessor the remake is its own movie. The bad news Expect sequels if it does well.RoboCop (B-)Directed by Jose Padilha.

Running time 108 minutes. Rated PG-13 (action violence profanity sexual situations drug references). At the Empire the Kips Bay the 84th Street others. The 1987 ""RoboCop"" was a good movie if you like bad movies. And who doesnt? The remake is something quite different thoughtful grounded more interested in questions of free will and emotions versus technology than it is in goofy satire. You know youre not in Paul Verhoeven-land anymore when our introduction to bionic fingers is watching them master classical guitar instead of lifting a guy by his Adams apple. Smartly and briskly directed by Brazils Jose Padilha the reboot stars Swedens Joel Kinnaman as Alex Murphy a cop in a Detroit of the near future who nearly loses his partner (Michael K. Williams) in a shootout he believes can be traced to dirty cops in his department. Asking too many questions gets Alex blown up by a car bomb in front of his wife (Abbie Cornish). And when he wakes up in a Chinese lab Alex Murphy isnt half the man he used to be or even one-quarter. All thats left of him is a face part of a brain lungs and one hand. The rest is now a cold steel law enforcement machine that the wily CEO of OmniCorp (Michael Keaton) hopes can help him crack the American market for robot-led security. Despite the rabble-rousing of a law-and-order TV personality (Samuel L. Jackson the only actor on hand who didnt get the memo not to be campy) the American people arent backing robot police which are being used everywhere else on Earth along with drones in lieu of occupying troops in overseas hot spots. Says Sellars (Keaton) If people demand human judgment behind every bad guy that gets blown away on domestic soil the surviving brain of Alex combined with a robot body is the perfect compromise -- or scam. What Alex doesnt know is that he is merely a ""passenger"" in his own body He enjoys the illusion of free will but all combat decisions are being handled by software. Still the lead scientist on the project (Gary Oldman) marvels that Alexs personality is asserting itself and busting through some of the protocols creating an entity that cant quite be controlled by remote although it can simply be switched off. The earlier film was painted in the broadest strokes with a ludicrously wicked corporation and a no-nonsense shoot-em-all hero but Padilha works more subtly This is a superhero film for grown-ups that reflects a moment when drone usage is hotly debated and its no longer ridiculous to contemplate a man who might have several metal limbs. The director isnt a master of action scenes though these are competently executed particularly a mass shootout in a darkened space. Where Padilha really succeeds though is in his warmth his wondering about the human element amid technological frenzy. Far from being a rock-em-sock-em B-movie this ""RoboCop"" wants to know what its like to be a person without a body how that person might appear to his own son (pretty much like the same old dad in a cool new outfit kids adapt) and how he might rebuild a life with his wife. The movie doesnt have the soul of ""Batman Begins"" and its sequels but its miles better than ""Transformers"" or ""Iron Man 3"" which was pure pandering fantasy meant to make adolescent boys feel rocket-fueled and quip-empowered but never tied down to any icky feelings or interior conflicts. Even the wicked OmniCorp is (for most of the film) more nuanced this time around Keatons character quotes Steve Jobs a couple of times and though profit and arrogance drive him he isnt wrong to note that machines tend to be more reliable than people or that Americans would rather lose robots than troops overseas. Security issues dont always fit perfectly onto a left-right template and neither does this ""RoboCop"" (though the original was cheeky in its leftism). ""RoboCop"" is topically up-to-the-moment but stylistically its retro. Far from using the story as an excuse to string together cheap thrills and blowout spectacle its hero has all the heart of the Tin Man. As the guitar player learning to work his new steel fingers puts it when he says there is more to his art than mere mechanics ""I need emotion to play.""

Despite some half-hearted stabs at a big idea or two -- is the title character a cyborg or merely a machine that thinks hes a man? -- were left with a competent but not very exciting movie about mechanized warfare and corporate irresponsibility. When ""RoboCop"" raises the notion that the armor-plated law enforcer is merely a robot that thinks its Detroit police officer Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman of TVs ""The Killing"") I was reminded briefly of writer Alan Moores acclaimed run with DC Comics Swamp Thing character in which he determined the slimy hero wasnt Dr. Alec Holland but merely a plant that had absorbed his memories. And in those moments where this new ""RoboCop"" seemed to be striking out in its own interesting directions forced by a PG-13 rating to explore other avenues than Verhoevens bloody saga I thought the way to consider this movie was less as a remake than as the equivalent of DCs multiple Earths where on one planet Green Lantern is a magic-powered hero whose powers dont work on wood and on another hes a member of an intergalactic police corps whos helpless against the color yellow. Watch video Samuel L. Jackson Thinks America Is Robophobic in New Robocop Trailer (Video) Had director Jose Padilha (""Elite Squad"") working from Joshua Zetumers retooling of Edward Neumeier and Michael Miners original screenplay made an action movie that stood on its own two feet then it would be easier to evaluate on its own independent of its source material. But this new ""RoboCop"" is plagued with such underwritten characters and logy pacing that its a letdown no matter how you slice it. Its a tale with a Greek chorus in this case Samuel L. Jackson playing cable-news pundit Pat Novak who appears on screen throughout to make the case for the powerful Omnicorp companys robotic peace-keepers -- which we see stopping and frisking the citizens of Teheran -- home to the U.S. to clean up our crime-ridden cities. Public opinion is against the idea since Senator Dreyfus (Zach Grenier and you can tell hes playing a liberal because hes always wearing a bowtie) thinks that the life-and-death choices of the police should be left in the hands of flesh-and-blood people. Thats not satisfactory for CEO Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton) who leans on scientist Dr. Norton (Gary Oldman) to create a part-human part-robot law enforcer so that Omnicorp can cash in on the domestic market. Norton gets an ideal candidate in Murphy who nearly dies in an explosion set by a crime kingpin whos got connections deep within the police department. Watch video Samuel L. Jackson Slams KTLA Reporter Sam Rubin Who Mistook Him for Laurence Fishburne (Video) The mechanized Murphy is good but Omnicorps actual robots are better; under pressure from Sellars Norton tinkers with Murphys mind to make him more machine than man. But when Murphy returns to Detroit and has to revisit his own murder scene -- not to mention his loving wife (Abbie Cornish) and son (John Paul Ruttan) -- it may turn out that theres still a soul locked inside the machine. Given how much Murphys humanity is a key to the story it would help if we had some idea of who this guy is apart from a clean cop whos a devoted husband and father. Kinnaman and Cornish get stuck playing such non-entities that the villains handily walk off with the film. I began perking up every time two smarmy Omnicorp execs played by Jennifer Ehle (oh if only shed gotten to play the Keaton role) and Jay Baruchel turned up on screen; Ehle brings a purring malice to every line even when shes speaking in press release. Also read Robocop Tops in 10 Markets but Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman Pulls Upset at U.K. Box Office (Video) Oldman is engaging enough and Padilha at least bothers to make the movies many shoot-outs look different from each other either by changing perspective among different robotic combatants or staging one via night-vision in a pitch-black warehouse. At nearly a full two hours however this new ""RoboCop"" tests the patience and never really justifies its own existence. ""RoboCop"" avoids being a bad remake by giving the original wide berth but all were left with this time around is a cop who becomes a robot without being particularly interesting in either incarnation.

It feels like the movie was made the same way too. The filmmakers started with the original 1987 slick sci-fi actioner by Paul Verhoeven. They disassembled it eliminating some of the wilder political satire and making the violence mostly bloodless. Then they added better effects a stronger supporting cast and a different ending. Its not as alive anymore -- but it works. The cynical touches are still here only updated (the cybercop is now an outgrowth of a drones program and the films newsbreaks are delivered by a mad Bill OReilly clone played by Samuel L. Jackson). And the basic plot remains -- in which a nearly murdered Detroit policeman is given a second chance by being outfitted with mechanical limbs an armored torso and a few chips in his brain. First order of business Get the people who tried to kill him. Its a good story if a familiar one -- theres a bit of the ""Judge Dredd"" comics in this -- and Brazilian director Jose Padilha (whose first film was the gripping documentary ""Bus 174"") handles the action sequences and special effects well. The various firefights are all staged a little differently. Some of the lab scenes -- particularly one which reveals our hero to consist solely of a head lungs and a single hand all connected by plastic tubes -- are gruesomely surreal. The films big flaw though is in its hero played by Swedens Joel Kinnaman -- and most recently of American TVs ""The Killing"" -- who seems robotic in or out of armor. (At least Peter Weller the original ""RoboCop"" had a beautifully sculpted mouth -- a distinct advantage when thats all you can see under that helmet.) But at least the dependable Gary Oldman adds a good deal of humanity as a corporate Dr. Frankenstein worrying about both free will and roll-out dates and its nice to have Michael Keaton and his devilish eyebrows back in action playing the billionaire villain. Between those two actors and some smart effects (Jackson does his TV interviews via holograms) the movie perks along for a good hour or so. Its only then it begins to lose its way introducing a third-act complication that doesnt really work. And while it should be applauded for not simply repeating the sardonic joke of the first film -- ""Youre fired"" -- it doesnt really have a better climax to replace it. The movie just sort of ties things up and ends. In the end like RoboCop himself it doesnt seem quite as truly organically alive as it once did. But it sure looks sleek and moves pretty fast. And if you dont think too much it almost feels like the real thing. Ratings note The film contains violence sexual situations strong language and drug references. RoboCop (PG-13) Columbia (118 min.) Directed by Jose Padilha. With Joel Kinnaman Abbie Cornish Michael Keaton.

But to give director Jose Padilha and his scriptwriters their due the new version goes out of its way to distance itself from the original. Junking Verhoevens sledgehammer satire and outrageous ultraviolence in favour of real-world politics and 12A thrills this is a slicker shinier admittedly inferior affair. But with a strong cast a roaring pace and at least one genuinely unforgettable scene its by no means a write-off.Joel Kinnaman is all cheekbones and chin as Alex Murphy the straight-arrow police officer whose fatal wounding in the line of duty makes him a perfect fit for tech-baron Michael Keaton and scientist Gary Oldmans latest attempt to create the perfect cybernetic law enforcer. But when Murphy wakes up in a lab stripped of all but his most vital organs he - along with his adoring wife played by Abbie Cornish - begins to question how much of the man is left inside this steel shell.The films most notable weakness is its action sequences the pace is too frenetic and the camera too shaky to hold the attention. The climax is particularly poor involving a lot of running shouting and blasting then its over. But RoboCop makes up for this deficiency in other areas. Its dedication to touching on tough questions - about will and self-determination about drone warfare and necessary force about the power of the media over public opinion - is admirable and the script has a certain blunt wit.

Daily Edition Login to download RoboCop Film Review 1000 AM PST 2/5/2014 by Leslie Felperin FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS This remake of the 1987 dystopian classic has a better cast more meticulous script and naturally flashier effects but it lacks the originals wit and subversive slipperiness. TWITTER Paul Verhoevens ruthless 1987 sci-fi satire has been broken down reconfigured and souped up for this flashy remake starring Joel Kinnaman Gary Oldman and Michael Keaton from Jose Padilha director of Brazilian hit ""Elite Squad."" Neither the complete disaster some might have been anticipating nor any kind of cinematic landmark the 2014 remake of RoboCop is a solid piece of mainstream entertainment that honors the legacy of Paul Verhoevens 1987 original and is certainly better than the last attack on a Verhoeven film 2012s Total Recall. The first feature film in English for director Jose Padilha whose Elite Squad and sequel Elite Squad The Enemy Within have been monster hits in his native Brazil and beyond RoboCop inventively breaks down reconfigures and soups up the core half-man half-machine cop-hero conceit. Its as if someone took an original Macintosh and packed it full of the very latest chips and graphics cards -- all very clever but just a tiny bit silly. That said in some ways the thoughtful dense script marks an improvement on the original and the cast is certainly tonier this time around. Whats missing is the originals evil wit amoral misanthropy and subversive slipperiness but that shouldnt stop people from spending a dollar (or 15) on the remake -- especially given the lack of competition. PHOTOS 35 of 2014s Most Anticipated Movies When it comes to remaking films theres something of an ethical spectrum. Pick a title no one much remembers and only few will mind; conversely dare to repackage a much-loved classic and there might just be picket lines or at least flaming tweets before casting even begins. RoboCop is an interesting case because it falls right in the middle ground Theres enough admiration out there for it even deep regard to invoke protective hostility toward the very idea of a remake. But theres also a whole generation that barely knows the original or its decreasingly interesting sequels except as a brand that spawned the now-common vernacular prefix ""robo."" Indeed a statistically unsound survey conducted for the purposes of this review among under-25s who had just seen the original for the first time found that some viewers were disappointed in the ""crude"" special effects (state-of-the-art in their day) ""wooden"" acting and ""jerky"" storyline even if the ""gore is totally cool."" Although theres plenty of blood splattered and some rather icky close-ups of brain surgery 2014s PG-13 RoboCop shies away from the violent extremes f-bombs and bared breasts (always a favorite with Verhoeven) that earned 1987s version an R. In fact this version is markedly more family friendly with its emphasis on parent-child relationships be they between the protagonist and his son or the more symbolic one between the hero and his doctor-creator. Set in 2028 the script credited to Joshua Zetumer along with Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner (who also wrote the original film) wafts in the chalky didactic smell of high-school civics lessons right from the start as a Fox News-like channel anchored by slick-haired Pat Novak (Samuel L. Jackson clearly having fun) covers the deployment of the latest robotic drones in a war-torn Tehran. Unabashedly biased Novak extols how effectively robotic manufacturer OmniCorps huge menacing ED-209 droids and the man-sized EM-208s search a street for potential insurgents - that is until some suicide bombers go on the attack and the live feed is cut when a droid kills a kid brandishing a knife. Back in the studio expository dialogue smoothly unfurls how the U.S. Congress is resisting efforts to deploy OmniCorp robots for homeland security despite the best persuasive efforts of the companys slick CEO Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton). VIDEO RoboCop Trailer Meanwhile in Detroit policeman Alex Murphy (Swedish actor Joel Kinnaman from TVs The Killing) is trying to bust a shadowy gun-smuggling ring with his partner Lewis (Michael K. Williams from The Wire and Boardwalk Empire) but gets blown to mostly dead smithereens by a car bomb. Sellars sees an opportunity to get around the pending robotic laws by putting a human inside a cybernetic exoskeleton. Aided and abetted by top lawyer Liz Kline (Jennifer Ehle) and marketing exec Tom Pope (Jay Baruchel) Sellars persuades one of OmniCorps top scientists Dr. Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman) to put aside his qualms about weaponizing human beings in order to turn Murphy into RoboCop. Although the rest of the plot pretty much follows Neumeier and Miners first go-round in 1987 with Murphy cleaning up the city and then turning his super-duper-Google-Glass-eyes on those who tried to kill him Padilha and the screenwriting team adjust the spaces between the story beats considerably. Theres a lot more time spent observing the technical development of RoboCop in a factory in China for instance affording an opportunity for a rather striking shot where Murphy tries to escape passing thousands of identically pink-coat-clad workers on a huge assembly line all-organic drones themselves in the service of OmniCorp. Much more of a fuss is made about explaining how Murphys brain chemistry is tweaked by nightly doses of nutrients anti-depressants and crucially later on dopamine that drastically reduces his capacity for emotion and thus increases his effectiveness as a machine. Considerable effort goes into beefing up the interpersonal stories that were so cursory in the original version with a new subplot centered round Alexs distraught wife Clara (Abbie Cornish) and son David (John Paul Ruttan) memories of whom resurrect RoboCops suppressed humanity. Its a shame that the remake changes Alexs partner Lewis from a strong woman (Nancy Allen who stuck it out through two of the sequels) to a male but the fact that the characters played by the always vivid Williams makes up for it a bit. STORY The Many Many Post-Movie Lives of RoboCop Indeed the casting across the board is an embarrassment of riches one wouldnt expect. Oldman brings nuance to Norton adding psychological flesh on a man not quite as upright as hed like to think he is. Keaton pitches the menace just right somewhere between Steve Jobs and Dick Cheney for his alpha-shark villain. Ehle and Baruchel are a hoot as the oleaginous corporate yes-people Jackie Earle Haley makes for an especially effective thug and Cornish finds a way to bring gravitas to the films most underwritten key role. Finally Kinnaman with his counterintuitive fragile features and spindly frame provides a strong emotional anchor throughout. April Ferrys costume design and the use of visual effects allows Kinnamans RoboCop to have his mask up more often than Peter Wellers giving him something of an advantage if comparing the two performances -- but even so theres clearly more depth here. But what most viewers are looking to spend their aforementioned dollars on are the action scenes and these too Padilha delivers dutifully favoring the kinetic handheld music driven style that made his Elite Squad films so compelling. Director of photography Lula Carvalho provides atmospheric assistance throughout pushing the grading and lighting to extremes for the films many nocturnal episodes while editing by Daniel Rezende and Peter McNulty has an incessantly propulsive drive although the transitions between scenes crash somewhat. Sometimes it feels like theres just too much stuff going on for the near two-hour running time to handle but its never boring. Like Verhoeven who caught a lot of flak for RoboCop way back when and even more for Starship Troopers Padilhas world view in the Elite Squad films has been read by some as quasi-Fascist particularly for the way the first film seems to celebrate violence machismo and police brutality. Perhaps in response to those criticisms Padilhas RoboCop shows an anti-corporate anti-military vaguely left-leaning hand although a token attempt has been made to seem ironic via the mock right-wing TV show. But as result the end product is nowhere near as troubling and teasing as the original which always felt like a somewhat stupid movie made by super-smart people. RoboCop 2014 doesnt exactly swap those values around but it doesnt have the same frisson of ambiguity that made RoboCop such a kick in 1987.

If anyone was under the impression that Paul Verhoevens 1987 ""RoboCop"" was a vision of the future Jose Padilhas  pumped-up cleaned-up update makes it clear that this sci-fi concept merely holds a mirror to the political present. Shifting the prime target of its satire from corporate greed to post-9/11 jingoism this well-cast smarter-than-expected remake repairs much of the damage done to the iron-fisted lawmans reputation by meat-headed sequels and spinoffs; its a less playful enterprise than the original but meets the eras darker demands for action reboots with machine-tooled efficiency and a hint of soul. The new model should capitalize on a dearth of equivalent genre fare in theaters without automatically activating a franchise relaunch. The once-mooted prospect of a Darren Aronofsky-directed ""RoboCop"" was certainly tantalizing but producers Eric Newman and Marc Abraham were wise to secure Brazilian adrenaline-monger Padilha (best known for his hard-edged ""Elite Squad"" thrillers) to take the reins here on his first English-language feature. Just as the bleakly cynical liberalism of the original ""RoboCop"" was ideally suited to Verhoevens European perspective so the new film benefits from a foreign helmers distance as it sends up American right-wing security concerns with a mostly straight face. Stylistically however Padilha and Verhoeven are very different brands of outsider While the Dutchman aimed to beat Hollywood at its own flashy game the Brazilian brings a rough street-level energy to the proceedings sometimes to the point of affectation. Set in an eminently recognizable 2028 ""RoboCop"" begins as did the first film with a current-affairs broadcast. Rather than the chirpily delivered evening-news bulletin of the original however were now tuned into ""The Novak Element"" a Fox News-style outlet for the heated political commentary of Pat Novak -- a Rush Limbaugh-like figure played by Samuel L. Jackson and an unreliable Greek chorus of sorts for the film. Blessed with a toupee straight from the ""Hunger Games"" school of future hairstyling Novak is a vocal ally of OmniCorp a U.S. robotics development corporation whose peacekeeping machines are -- in the first of several key deviations from the original script -- already in use abroad though not in ""robophobic"" America where politicians fiercely debate the ethics of non-human policing. Working with brilliant but ambivalent scientist Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman) OmniCorp CEO Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton) hits on a solution a robot fused with human body and brain parts that is capable of making moral judgment calls. Over in Detroit -- the citys crime-ridden image scarcely updated from 1987 -- a prototype emerges in the sharp-jawed form of slain cop Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman of AMCs ""The Killing""). With his comatose remains signed off to OmniCorp by grieving wife Clara (Abbie Cornish) Murphy is reformulated as RoboCop -- though when he underperforms in initial testing runs Norton has his brain rewired to follow software rather than human impulses. This essential elimination of the moral conscience that makes RoboCop politically palatable is snuck through the system and the android Murphy is a hit on the Motor City streets while Clara grows increasingly suspicious of OmniCorps motives. Order is short-lived however as Murphys emotions gradually override his programming -- a development that the scripts already sketchy movie science sentimentally attributes to the power of the human spirit -- and he sets about solving his own not-quite-murder. Joshua Zetumers script cleverly reshapes the psychological quest of the original film to fit a 21st-century American culture arguably more preoccupied with emotional intelligence than it was in the late Reagan era Where the first film had RoboCop discovering his humanity after being conceived and introduced as a robot his more complex goal here is to regain the human qualities he was initially given and by which he has been advertised to the public politicians and his family alike. Theres an increased satirical focus here on the corporations positioning of RoboCop as both product (""He transforms"" a marketer enthuses slyly referencing a certain other metallic action series) and patriot. Tellingly as befits a humanized Captain America-style national protector the new RoboCop suit has a retractable visor that allows the audience access to Murphys face earlier and more often than in the 1987 film. (Purists may object but theres only so long you can reasonably keep the model-handsome Kinnaman covered up.) Placing Murphys wife and child at the center of the narrative is essential to this more EQ-driven approach though its also a more predictable -- even conservative -- route than that taken by the original film which effectively wrote the family out of the picture instead placing the emotional burden of recognition on his spunky female partner. Zetumer and Padilhas modernization of the RoboCop mythos doesnt extend to feminism Though played with some steel by Cornish Clara has no identity or agency beyond her marriage to Murphy while more coldly high-powered roles for Marianne Jean-Baptiste and Jennifer Ehle (both excellent) are hardly flattering. The cast in general performs well above the minimum demands of the material. Kinnaman lacks the lithe wryness Peter Weller brought to the 1987 film but has his own cool authority while Keaton (perhaps having less fun with the role than the initially cast Hugh Laurie might have done) is a reserved genuinely off-putting villain leaving the maniacal business to a ripe Jackie Earle Haley as OmniCorps chief militarist. Best in show handily is Oldman whose tender ruefulness as Norton does a good deal of the films emotional legwork. Verhoevens film stirred controversy with its level of bloodshed though the franchises strange evolution toward a youth audience not necessarily attuned to the first films irony -- fans may even remember the ""RoboCop"" cartoon series -- diluted that intensity. The new ""RoboCop"" hits on a compromise The degree of direct onscreen gore is sufficiently modest to ensure a PG-13 rating but the clammy on-the-ground atmosphere conjured by Padilha and Lula Carvalhos restlessly roving camera feels both urgent and adult. After the ""Elite Squad"" films Padilha knows the perils of urban warfare better than most though the handheld authenticity card can be overplayed in the films talkier interior scenes. On the design front the updates to the familiar RoboCop iconography are respectful but sleekly streamlined. Gone are the endearingly clunky robot effects of the original film as all the machinery here -- including of course that all-important suit here given a slight Daft Punk accent -- exudes contempo architectural glamour. Uniformly solid visual-effects work is most arresting in the lab scenes that show what remains of Murphy without his armor -- a reveal that leads one to wonder at least fleetingly how a David Cronenberg ""RoboCop"" remake might play out.

Jamal Heiden says February 22 2014 at 253 pm That was a good review and not one that I can really disagree with. I mostly feel that if we had to have RoboCop now this was the right RoboCop to have. I put my thoughts in audio form. http//www.looktothecookie.org/2014/02/robocop-vs-robotcop.html Reply guardienne says February 19 2014 at 1243 am great stuff loved the cronenberg reference. seeing as they are interrupted earlier its a shame the film never picks up the intimacy issue. overall i enjoyed it. and i havent seen the old film so cant comment on whether its better or what. i feel that this one is playing for tragedy and thats not a bad thing in my book. Reply Victor says February 18 2014 at 919 am Well I love that they made this remake I loved that the director wanted to brought a more adult more realistic and serious aproach to the movie. Most people agrees this formula did wonders to Batman and relived an icon. However Padilha is no Chris Nolan. And so even if he does have the skills to do the same for Robocop as nolan did for Batman he mostly certain does not have the power yet to do so. The way I see Hollywood producers will always try to aim at a more large audience by so doing a more entertaining simplistic and special effects oriented stories. Few directors can ignore this direct influence to his work. Nolan is one of them Padilha is not so he delivered the best he managed and for what I am reading so far it seems he did his homework well. Reply Ashley says February 17 2014 at 929 pm Sorry to say.. Im so extremely disappointed. Its too much it ruined the story of the original I went straight home with my whole entire family and watched the original. It was graphically impressive but I couldnt bare sit there seeing how RoboCop wasnt RoboCop.. As a true fan.. Sorry I hated it. Reply Saint Foo (cpjackson79) says February 16 2014 at 403 pm I enjoyed this movie. I found it refreshing that a sci-fi/action flick wasnt crammed full of ridiculous catastrophes and dumb chase scenes that go on forever. I appreciated the human side of this as well. I liked that it painted the concept of instantaneous justice in a poor light because I dont think most of us want to live in that kind of world yet the more automated L.E. becomes the more it will be like this. I only have two problems -- it plodded along for the first hour and the conclusion was kind of iffy. Theres a ""training exercise"" scene early on that features one of the best rock songs of the last 40 years (Hocus Pocus by Focus)- when music was about the music and not about looking pretty. There were some other clever musical choices as well. I think reviewers are being a bit too harsh with this edition. Some are comparing it to the old version (apples and oranges) some are saying its too action-oriented. Others are saying its not action-oriented enough. The Considering the negativity aimed at this one months before it was released theres an uphill struggle built in and thats unfortunate. This flick stands on its own. I wouldnt give it lower than a B. Reply Dave says February 14 2014 at 1224 am For those of you hatin on the movie go see it first The movie was good the reveal was a highlight and they make some classic references to the original as well Some of you need to understand that just because it is a remake and the original actors/actresses didnt want it doesnt mean you have to disregard the movie as trash Go see the movie for yourself you may be surprised Reply scootrmonkey says February 11 2014 at 1236 pm Reblogged this on my mostly unfabulous life and commented i wasnt holding out much hope for this  but the reviews ive read have been fairly positive ... Reply Rex says February 11 2014 at 605 pm Doesnt this simply mean that you only read positive reviews? Reply scootrmonkey says February 11 2014 at 607 pm no - I have read some not-so-positive reviews of it  but will reserve judgement until I see it Mermaid24 says February 9 2014 at 519 pm The movie is a complete disaster and we all knew it before it was officially released. There are furious fans around the world (me included) for the audacity of director Jose Padilha to rip off a classic movie that didnt need to be remade. Peter Weller and Nancy Allen have both said publicly that they believe a classic like RoboCop should have been left alone. And they are right. Instead of giving us a GCI Robo movie new animated series or even a fair sequel Hollywood decides its time to destroy Verhoevens vision and turn RoboCop into a complete different thing A mix of Batman and Iron man in black spandex. And they want us to buy their idea. I hope this film fails miserably at the box office. Thank you but not thank you. I stay with the original classic of the 87. Reply Walter White says February 6 2014 at 1039 am Variety was once the epitome of good film reviews and even dared to ask if Jessica Chastain was a great actress? Nah Ill give this RoboBore a miss - not interested in the melodramatics of a human (whos badly wounded from a bomb blast ohhhhh) and coming to terms with his new outer shell. Reply Bartosz Ciorga says February 7 2014 at 615 am Dunno how about you but for me there is nothing more desirable and interesting than the ability to resurrect or to restore an irreversibly crippled person to a normal life. All the other issues are just minor compared to that. Reply franie says February 5 2014 at 716 pm We dont care if you think the lead actor is attractive. We dont care if you think Cronenberg or Aronovsky shouldve made it instead and NO we do not remember the cartoon series or the short lived live action canadian produced Robocop TV Series what we do care about is why your review is called positive by Rotten Tomatoes? Its pretty much useless. Reply John Shea says February 6 2014 at 916 am Whos we? An Australian fashion magazine? Reply andrewhyte says February 5 2014 at 649 pm This is a great post about the movie. The update for having a Brazilian director that compares to the English director of the original 1987 director is great. Its reassuring to know that the storyline is updated and has different elements from the original. Reply xsf27 says February 6 2014 at 1203 am The director of the original film Paul Verhoeven is Dutch not English. Reply Jose says February 5 2014 at 427 pm Guy how much of Limbaugh have you listened to? He is hardly a proponent of aggressive domestic policing. Reply guylodge says February 5 2014 at 556 pm I didnt mean the comparison quite that literally -- more a matter of stature and delivery. Reply clydee says February 5 2014 at 158 pm love joel K.  Reply guylodge says February 5 2014 at 126 pm An absent-minded slip Thank you. Reply John Shea says February 5 2014 at 317 pm Youre welcome though my comment is AWOL at the moment. Reply JOE S HILL says February 5 2014 at 1236 pm As i have yet to see this remakewhich ill likely be in no rush to do sothe 1987 Orion Pictures movie IS still the bestand ONLY version to date and given MGMs financial arrangements with Sonyi just wish that one dayor soonthat MGM can stand on its own feetwithout depending on Sonys backing much less anyone elses as for this remakelets see how it can do on its own steambut unless this director has done what Paul Verhoeven hasnti dont give it much good odds Reply David Oakes (david0akes) says February 5 2014 at 1035 am I read in another review that the ""reveal"" of whats left of Murphy is very very poor and the films lowpoint. Reply LondonCityNights says February 7 2014 at 702 am Nah its easily the most memorable image in the film.
