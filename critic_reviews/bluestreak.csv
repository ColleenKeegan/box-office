With Martin Lawrence as its star Blue Streak is another of those action comedies dating back to Beverly Hills Cop that rely on a likable streetwise fast-talking character to pump the helium of humor into familiar proceedings. In this instance the buoyancy is only intermittent. Blue Streak directed by Les Mayfield and written by the committee of Michael Berry John Blumenthal and Steve Carpenter pivots on an elaborate nighttime jewel heist gone wrong. When the incompetent wheelman Tulley (Dave Chappelle) attracts the attention of the police by dumping an ashtray full of butts out his car window while awaiting the getaway and when the homicidally traitorous Deacon (Peter Greene) attempts to increase his share of the burglary proceeds by shooting a confederate who plummets from a rooftop onto a patrol car the safecracker Miles Logan (Martin Lawrence) is left holding the bag. It is only a small bag but inside is a single diamond valued at 18 million. During his effort to evade capture Logan flees to a construction site and manages to tape the bag to the wall of an air-conditioning vent before he is arrested. Released from prison two years later he discovers that the construction site has become a Los Angeles police station whose inner precincts are barred to all but criminals and lawmen. Thanks to forged identity documents Logan passes himself off as a newly transferred detective and when a criminal runs loose while Logan is detaching a vent cover in the womens bathroom he becomes an instant hero and the new leader of the burglary unit. Not long afterward while downing a snack in a convenience store he finds himself in the middle of a stickup and manages -- unarmed -- to capture the gunman who just happens to be his old pal Tulley. And next thing he knows using his criminal thought processes he outwits the arrogant F.B.I. in a huge heroin case just as his old nemesis Deacon comes to cash in on Logans recovery of the diamond. Among movies of its type Blue Streak may be classified among the zircons. Blue Streak is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes coarse language gunplay and some comic physical violence. BLUE STREAK Directed by Les Mayfield; written by Michael Berry John Blumenthal and Steve Carpenter; director of photography David Eggby; edited by Michael Tronick; music by Edward Shearmur; production designer Bill Brzeski; produced by Toby Jaffe and Neal H. Moritz; released by Columbia Pictures. Running time 93 minutes. This film is rated PG-13. WITH Martin Lawrence (Miles Logan) Luke Wilson (Carlson) Dave Chappelle (Tulley) Peter Greene (Deacon) Nicole Ari Parker (Melissa Green) Graham Beckel (Rizzo) Robert Miranda (Glenfiddish) Olek Krupa (LaFleur) and William Forsythe (Hardcastle).

In the wake of a summer of capers and cons ""Blue Streak"" arrives as a dull afterthought and a sorry vehicle for the comic expression of Martin Lawrence. Though unevenly devised as an homage to the whole range of 70s crime pics from blaxploitation to buddie cop comedies modest production plays closer to a made-for-TV project than anything worthy of the bigscreen. This will be the true test of Lawrences drawing power both as proof of what fans will tolerate from the star and whether thesps recent near-death experience will translate into curious sympathetic ticket buyers. After opening-week bang ""Streak"" will dissolve into B.O. blur with eventual ancillary cash-in. Unlike his success as co-star with Eddie Murphy in ""Life"" Lawrence has to carry the day by himself and ends up suffering the familiar scourge endured by funnymen forced to make some kind of silk purse out of a sows ear. While the script by Michael Berry John Blumenthal and Steve Carpenter relies heavily on irony -- protags skills as a jewel thief prove to be a bonus when he poses as a cop -- its of the clunkiest most obvious kind resulting in a depressingly low laugh count. In fact as he has displayed before Lawrence can be most effective in straight dramatic moments and that is just what he delivers here in a well-paced 13-minute prologue as a heist crew led by ruthless Deacon (Peter Greene) bypasses security at a downtown L.A. skyscraper to nab a large megamillion-dollar diamond. Lawrences Miles Logan is believably no-nonsense as the safecracker and when Deacon tries to double-cross him and the rest of the crew Miles duct-tapes the rock in a vent of the neighboring building under construction and then is quickly arrested. Action slows to a lumbering pace as it jumps forward two years to Miles prison release and a pathetically unfunny scene with spurning g.f. Janiece (Tamala Jones) which pretty much sets standard for rest of pics stabs at comedy. Miles bigger bummer follows though when he returns to the scene of the crime and realizes that the building where he stored the precious stone is now an LAPD headquarters. Copying the kind of antics Lawrence used to do in his ""Martin"" series Miles returns to the building disguised as a buck-toothed pizza delivery boy and in the process swipes rookie detective Carlsons (Luke Wilson) security and ID cards. With forgeries and a cool set of threads Miles returns a third time posing as Detective Malone. No sooner is Miles in the door then lucks turns his way. While trying to get inside an air duct from the ladies restroom to retrieve the rock he inadvertently nabs an escaping felon impressing brass who assign him as lead detective partnered with Carlson. Duo go through standard genre antics showoff Miles drives like Bullitt and his streetwise methods upstage Carlsons bland by-the-books gumshoe. But what could have been a funny and thrilling centerpiece to this section falls flat as Miles happens to run into -- and reluctantly arrests -- Tulley (Dave Chappelle) the getaway driver in the jewel heist now reduced to holding up liquor stores. Per production notes Chappelles role was expanded from cameo to supposedly bigger showcase for the gifted comic but a mere slip of his talents is mined here. The hoped-for Lawrence-Chappelle chemistry never ignites and theyre left with a series of half-written scenes in which Miles is unable to explain his situation to Tulley and compelled to prove his bona fides to Los Angeles Police Dept. comrades like the aptly named Hardcastle (William Forsythe) by torturing Tulley. Lawrence more a visual than a verbal comic has seldom been so ineffective his strengths virtually untapped by helmer Les Mayfield. The cast pulls off some mildly effectively tough guys led by Forsythe and Greene with Olek Krupa effectively fearsome as a drug kingpin and Nicole Ari Parker limning a tough-gal public defender. Pics flat overlit look and L.A. settings are tips of the cap to 70s style reinforced by Edward Shearmurs funk-driven score and touches like the closing freeze-frame. Style though is not pushed to resounding effect consistent with pics overall half-realized feel.

In Blue Streak Martin Lawrence plays a burglar who gets out of prison and impersonates...1999-09-24Dave ChappelleColumbia Pictures D+ Blue Streak Genre Comedy; Starring Martin Lawrence Luke Wilson Dave Chappelle; Director Les Mayfield; Runtime (in minutes) 93; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Columbia Pictures Posted September 24 1999 -- 1200 AM EDT How lame have high-concept no-brain comedies gotten? In Blue Streak Martin Lawrence plays a burglar who gets out of prison and impersonates a cop so that he can retrieve his prize booty a diamond the size of a chestnut which is locked in a downtown Los Angeles police station. The concept is smart-mouth black cop whos crazy enough to do anything. But just contrast Blue Streak with its obvious progenitor Beverly Hills Cop. In that movie Eddie Murphys words shot off in all directions. In Blue Streak Lawrences Miles Logan fumbles around a bit as he attempts to master the steely postures of an L.A. detective yet the surrounding officers are such dim bulbs that it doesnt take much effort for him to fit in. Blue Streak is structured as a thief-out-of-water comedy but Martin acts like more of a real cop than Murphy ever did. The movie actually prefers him that way. Its too in love with authority with formula to explode into a wild-ass celebration of a guy who trashes the rules. Lawrence was funny and fascinating when he unleashed his aggression in A Thin Line Between Love amp; Hate and the movie which he wrote and directed (impressively) was even a modest hit. But ever since then hes been mealy and eager to please on screen. He seems trapped in his jug-eared slightly clownish nervousness like a sidekick suddenly shoved into the spotlight. Blue Streak pairs Lawrence with the likable Luke Wilson who steals scenes by underplaying his quizzical blankness. As an underworld crony whom Logan is forced to arrest Dave Chappelle simmers and writhes. Its the star whos on autopilot. Then again maybe these other actors would be too if they had to hold together a movie that can barely get a grip on its own concept.

Starring Martin Lawrence Luke Wilson and Dave Chappelle. Directed by Les Mayfield. Written by Michael Berry John Blumenthal and Steve Carpenter. (PG-13. 93 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Judging by ""Blue Streak"" an action comedy that opens today the American publics faith in law enforcement is at an all-time low. That would explain the attitude in this outrageous goof about a Los Angeles burglar who masquerades as a cop -- and makes the real-life police look like patsies for believing him. If the makers of this film didnt think that moviegoers regard cops as fools then ""Blue Streak"" wouldnt exist. In a part that feels tailor-made for his loose-cannon persona -- both on screen and off -- Martin Lawrence plays Miles Logan a career jewel thief who does two years in the can and later pulls off the ultimate scam. Armed with forged papers a phony badge and a crash course in police demeanor via the TV series ""COPS"" Logan cons the officers at an L.A. police precinct into thinking hes one of them. Hes got an objective Before he was collared Miles stashed a 20 million diamond in an air duct in a building un der construction. Today damn his luck the building is a police station. ""Blue Streak"" doesnt ask us to believe that Logan is good at impersonating a cop -- only that real-life cops are dumb enough to buy his bluff. It doesnt matter that it looks bogus to the audience; the cops buy it wholesale and chalk it up to street style creative thinking and ""shakin things up."" Improvising squirmy motor-mouth riffs on police procedure Miles makes a royal mockery of the LAPD. No the movie never mentions O.J. or Rodney King -- but the stain they left on L.A. police is implicit in this movies cynical premise. Lawrence reportedly did a lot of ad- libbing on ""Blue Streak"" and the best scenes are those in which he gets a manic gleam in his eye and explodes with buggy energy. Hes like the hell-bent Mel Gibson character from ""Lethal Weapon"" -- only angrier crazier a reminder of the thin line separating cop from criminal. Apart from Lawrences goofing ""Blue Streak"" isnt much of a movie and its formula of stunts anti-authority humor and a chase-and-crash finale is predictable enough to be depressing. It probably wont hurt though This kind of movie is critic-proof and I wouldnt be surprised to see it become a continuing franchise provided Lawrence can overcome his personal problems. ""Blue Streak"" was directed by Les Mayfield who made the awful Robin Williams comedy ""Flubber."" Hes on surer ground here directing Lawrence and a strong supporting cast instead of depending on lame visual effects. Dave Chappelle always funny plays a nervous getaway driver and Luke Wilson (""Rushmore"") is ideal as a gullible square cop who is partnered with Lawrence. ..
