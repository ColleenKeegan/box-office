Its in Devon that we meet young Albert (Jeremy Irvine) his farming parents (Emily Watson Peter Mullan) and the horse Joey to whom he becomes attached and whose various owners lead us to the Western Front and back again. Its only when three army officers played by Benedict Cumberbatch Tom Hiddleston and Patrick Kennedy with a verve missing in the earlier scenes enter the movie and charge into battle that we encounter anything resembling the brio we expect from the director of Saving Private Ryan and ET. Spielberg still manages to surprise and impress. Theres a smart image of the revolving blade of a windmill masking an execution in rural France. When it feels like his depiction of war is too soft his camera sweeps up to reveal a scarred battlefield. There are other strong moments the horses dash through battle offers much-needed flesh and blood while theres a moment of minimal spectacle and measured emotion as two opposing soldiers meet during a ceasefire to help free the beast.The main problem with War Horse is not that its episodic - which it is the horses odyssey leads him to various people and places fatally relegating Irvines Albert to a distant memory - but that Spielberg doesnt solve the conundrum of having an animal at the heart of his film. For Morpurgo it was a first-horse narration. For the play it was scene-stealing puppetry. All Spielberg can do is observe the creature make the most of its few situations of peril and hope the surrounding drama is distracting enough. Fairytale quasi-mythical visions of life even war are fine but theres an alienating push and pull here between the savagery of war and Spielbergs fear of scaring the horses.

Its a feat of engineering a masterpiece of design. It really is fantastic how easily the mind believes these puppets are living breathing horses. Unfortunately however the rest of the show often doesnt live up to the puppetry. Its twee over-the-top and a little sickly. The acting is passable but the humans are outshone by the horses. The emotional punch comes early as the villagers sing that their young men will return from the war by Christmas. How wrong they were. Yet the rest is disappointing. The main mistake in my view is casting the little French girl as a grown woman. This is irritating and these scenes drag. In all I preferred the book and the production has its flaws but theres no way youll leave disappointed in the puppetry. Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreFeb 29 2012deecFeaturedFor once I completely agree with the Timeout review. Yes its an OK film and it deserves 3 stars but no more. I have read this book and the book is written from the horses point of view. As a non horse lover I thought this would be my worst nightmare to read but it is written amazingly and you really warm to war horse and what he endures through the war. I dont think the film captures this at all. It leaves really important parts out plays down the father at the start and doesnt build a big enough picture around the involvement of the grandfather and grandaughter. I also agree with the reviewer who commented on the other 3 1/2 years of the war being missing. Spielberg does not show enough of the bond between Topthorn and Joey with Topthorns death being really underplayed and also what happens to Joey after that. Yes the war scenes are ok but this is not really the point of the story and as another reviewer pointed out was probably an opportunity for Spielberg to make up for previous cheesy American war films. As a Scot the bagpipes during one war scene immediately disctracted me from the film as I thought ""No"". Who honestly would have put these in a film other than a cheesy American. I also agree about the varied and mixed accents and the skyline at the end. What was that all about and what was the point in even mentioning the girl from the village if it wasnt going to show you her with Albert and Joey at the end?? They made more of that in the film than in the book then ignored it? A little disappointed all round.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreFeb 23 2012Tony WFeaturedif you go to the cinema to be entertained then this film will. if you want deep meaningful characters . complex storylines clever dialogue then look elsewhere.

Secondly the timeout reviewer is completely out of line when saying he was thinking to much about scaring the horses and so he should of been no one is going to throw a horse into a situation where it is going to be extremely scared especially as a scared horse is an extremely dangerous thing not only to the horse but others around it too. He did everything he could with what he had to work with and he made a stunning film. You immediately grow attached to the horse and want more than anything for it to return safely. There are some genuinely beautiful scenes to be appreciated in this film. And I am not one to cry on a film but I cried like a baby for ages. It is a definete for horse lovers.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreFeb 20 2012NaomiFeaturedFirstly this film is incredible.

I thoroughly enjoyed the film although I almost did not go to see it after reading the original unfair review. It was so good to watch a film and not have to sit through graphic torture scenes and gratuitous violence. We are not all trying to prove how macho and unshockable we are.

After 20 minutes the film showed some excellent trench warfare scenes that reflected on the utter futility of war.At this point I was warming to the film but then came the sequence where the horse ran through at least 3 razor wire fences at top speed before being rescued by an excruciatingly badly acted Anglo/German combo that frankly was so corny rhat I squirmed in embarassment. On the plus side it was a visual feast and the south west tourist board will be doing more cartwheels than the majority of the paying public.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 23 2012alanFeaturedSteve - you are a complete sucker if you go to see a film and cant be bothered to find anything about it - especially as this is now a famous childrens book and has been on the west end stage for three years.

On reflection-why the film angered me was when i saw the trailer in the cinema it was edited to look like a really grim hard war film like- sav-p-Ryan or thin red line. I had no prior knowledge of a bk or musical-if I had then would of know what to expect. Felt they billed it as great war film to get masses to pay to watch. This left me feeling like Id been ripped-off A bit like when ur sold a product amp; sales guy tells you its great for this+that. Then you go home and realise it doesnt do what you want and youve just been totally ripped-off They lied to make the film seem like its something its not. Then suckers like me go and pay to see it and feel cheated Wouldnt you agree?Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 21 2012Ando SFeaturedOk so there are loads of Spielberg Bashers commenting on War Horse on this site but I think the Time Out review is pretty fair. This film is a decent old fashioned war movie aimed at a young audience but one that can easily be enjoyed by adults. Sentimental? Maybe. Unrealistic? Not entirely. Have people here ever owned a horse? The battle scenes are immense the score grand and overall just a wonderful evening out. Far better than the latest Indiana Jones anyway.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 19 2012NickFeaturedCrikey this was bad. Ive been chuckling about this film ever since I emerged from the cinema last night - shell shocked at the time I was still pondering the fate of the French farmers granddaughter and Neds turnips and perhaps wondering why Devon looked like Gone with the wind crossed with a Stella Artois advert. But seriously if this film makes you cry with anything other than laughter you should be very worried.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 19 2012scrumpyjackFeaturedAnother viewing 1) to ensure I wasnt losing it 2) as first saw it on my nearests good but not best screen 3) really enjoyed it. Can all these ONE STAR oddballs avoid cinema in future as I dont wish to breath in your negativity Findings 1) Im fine 2) see it on the biggest screen you can find amp; 3) still 8/10. Bit corny?

The Film screenplay and production were appalling. Patronising false pretencious fatasistical rubbish. Every sky in Devon seemed to be more and more outrageous ending on one so orange it must have been filmed on Mars. A poor farming family who had nothing except and immaculate inside and out farmhouse which looked like it had been built that afternoon. A field with no soil only stones miraculously turns into the most fertile field in Devon. Despite it being a war just about every soldier we see seemed incredibly polite helpful and almost happy. I cannot belive that they took the time to haggle over the price of a horse and in fact surprised they even game them any money for them. There is not room to go through all the inaccuracies. The end was so contrived and syrupy and like a pantomime with the evil Butcher of Cambrai and Anthony Worrell Thompson who has the most perfect fruit in Belgium but has walked 3 miles to spend APS100 that I doubt he really had by the end of the war. I cant go on it was so over the top predictable and annoying. Also why if the Horse was enlisted at the beginning of the war 1914 and was taken by the Germans for a matter of weeks a young Belgian girl for a maximum of a few months the germans for a mximum of a few weeks do we suddenly see it at the end of the war in 1918. What happened in the intervening three and a half years? If the story was dramtic enough and interesting enough to make a film of it then at least be faithful to it and not turn it into some Disneylike effort. Spielberg obviously feels all the material he deals with is so ordinary he has to tart it all up and like Tintin ruin it. As for it being his best work How does Schindlers List possible fall below this rubbish.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 15 2012CarolFeaturedThe films sluggish lazy in its detail and frankly not very good. As TOs Tom Huddleston says its twee - the only thing the village was missing was a sign that read ""Ye Olde Shoppe"". I was bored to sobs.

It had me a little misty eyed towards the end and that isnt a bad thing. The review is about right. Its good just not what we used to expect from Spielberg. I just felt that there were too many cliches to make it a great film. Its worth more than 3 stars but not really 4. One to see with anyone and it wont be a let down just not a total joy.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Sunday Dec. 25 2011 1200AM EST Last updated Tuesday Oct. 16 2012 1217PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Country USA Language English Sumptuous and schmaltzy Steven Spielbergs First World War drama War Horse is a strange beast of a film. Its at once an old-fashioned tale of the love between a boy and his horse and a sweeping survey of the battlefields of Europe. Here and there are spectacular action scenes but overall it unfolds at a leisurely pace over its 146-minute running time. Movies War Horse The official trailer Actress Emily Watson appears in War Horse. AP Film Video Emily Watson and her fear of horses Movies Video Spielbergs War Horse gallops into theatres Unlike his Second World War film Saving Private Ryan in which Spielberg used modern handheld cameras to recreate the immersive shock of the Normandy landing War Horse utilizes old-fashioned filmmaking using artificial light but largely eschewing digital effects to create a broad-canvas drama. Filled with overhead landscape shots and Technicolor-looking skies Spielbergs approach spells grandeur in giant skywriting all set to a John Williams score that squeezes every drop out of any emotionally available moment.The source material is Michael Morpurgos 1982 childrens novel - told like Black Beauty from the point of view of the horse - which has also been adapted into a much-awarded play using horse puppets with actors inside emphasizing the bond between human and animal sufferers. The film version written by Lee Hall ( Billy Elliot) and Richard Curtis ( Four Weddings and a Funeral) is never less than emotionally obvious.In the films pastoral first half hour shot in the glowingly picturesque Devon countryside by Spielbergs frequent collaborator Janusz Kaminiski a beautiful half-thoroughbred foal is born. When the horse grows up a hard-drinking war hero Ted (Peter Mullan) foolishly acquires it to the despair of his wife Rosie (Emily Watson) who knows they need a plow animal not this sleek beauty.Their teenaged son Albert (Jeremy Irvine) who dubs the horse Joey promises to train the animal. Just as the familys land is about to be lost to the sneering local landlord (David Thewlis) Joey exhibits super-equine strength and love for Albert and hauls a plow over the stony ground while the villagers watch in awe.When war is (at last) declared and Joey is sold to the army the narrative shifts gears. The story becomes one of those episodic tales of a single thing connecting separate lives - Winchester 73 Twenty Bucks The Yellow Rolls-Royce The Red Violin - or even Robert Bressons 1966 saintly donkey movie Au hazard Balthazar.First Joey is sold to a good-natured British officer (Tom Hiddleston). While in the cavalry Joey befriends another stallion Topthorn and together they participate in the first battle which starts in a wheat field and explodes into the thrill of thundering hoofbeats in a charge on a German encampment. After the initial brutal assault the tide turns in the Germans favour. Here Spielberg the ace technician shows his flair for choreographed tumult. An overhead shot of human and horse corpses littering the battlefield is as powerful as anything in the film.By comparison Spielberg is jarringly offhand about the dispatch of a couple of German teen soldiers (Leonhard Carow and David Kross) who take the horse into their care. Next Joey ends up with a philosophical old French jam-maker ( A Prophets Niels Arestrup) and his sickly granddaughter (Celine Buckens). After that brief bucolic respite he is once again taken by the Germans this time in the life-draining business of pulling artillery through the mud.In this picaresque tale of misery where the characters are nearly all archetypes of youth wisdom duty and so on we eventually arrive in the hellish trenches with rival mass armies dug into fields of mud and barbed wire with long tracking shots and overhead views giving us the full effect. The scene concludes with a climactic episode in which the panicked Joey leaps over a looming tank and races through no mans land winding himself in ribbons of barbed wire that eventually drag him to a halt. Perhaps no one but Spielberg could have filmed this and as welcome as this uncharacteristic burst of intensity feels it also feels oddly out of place with the temperate tone of the rest of the movie.As coincidences and miracles pile up in the films final third Joey takes on the dimensions of a magical creature who even outclasses E.T. The concluding scene in which Spielberg manages to evoke the tangerine skies of Gone with the Wind proves particularly resistible. To expect anything other than an awesome redemptive ending from a Spielberg film would be foolish. The trouble here is not so much that Spielbergs film staunchly insists on finding a happy ending even in the calamity of the First World War but that he slathers it on so thick and leaves so soft an impression.War HorseDirected by Steven SpielbergWritten by Lee Hall and Richard CurtisStarring Jeremy Irvine Peter Mullan and Emily WatsonClassification PGTwo and a half starsWar Horse opens on Sunday.

Photo Credit Andrew Cooper Photo/ advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A young British boy signs up for WWI to search for his beloved horse. BOTTOM LINE Equal parts profound and corny but always emotionally powerful and beautiful to look at. Parents should take the PG-13 rating seriously. CAST Jeremy Irvine Emily Watson Peter Mullan Toby Kebbell LENGTH 226 Though based partly on a childrens novel Steven Spielbergs ""War Horse"" is not entirely a childrens movie. It does star a boy and a horse and it has many moments of warmth humor and reassuring corn. But ""War Horse"" is also a film about the human animal and its capacity for violence and cruelty. You can always depend on Spielberg to land on the side of optimism of course just as you know hell put you through the wringer to get there. The story is simple In rural Devon England a young farm boy Albert Narracott (Jeremy Irvine a suitably fresh-faced newcomer) makes fast friends with a spirited horse named Joey. But when England enters the Great War in 1914 Alberts drunken father Ted (Peter Mullan) sells the animal to the cavalry. Ted and his wife (Emily Watson) soon lose their son as well Albert enlists determined to find his friend.

What follows is a series of vignettes in which Joey sees the war from nearly every angle Hell gallop under the noble Captain Nicholls (a deeply moving Tom Hiddleston) haul artillery for the Germans brighten the days of an orphaned French girl (Celine Buckens) and end up stranded between sides in No Mans Land -- the storys most resonant and symbolic chapter. For better and sometimes for worse Joey ultimately reflects the humanity around him. ""War Horse"" is also based on the still-running Tony-winning stage play rightly acclaimed for its life-size horse puppets and stark harrowing visuals. Spielberg goes more for a classic Western with dramatic lighting and russet-colored skies (the cinematographer is his longtime collaborator Janusz Kaminski). The material sometimes feels oversugared though its also guaranteed to raise a lump in your throat. PLOT A young British boy signs up for WWI to search for his beloved horse.

"War Horse review Steven Spielbergs corny equine drama breached my emotional defenses. Slate Sign In Sign Up Steven Spielbergs Corny War Horse Breached My Emotional Defenses Steven Spielbergs Corny War Horse Breached My Emotional Defenses Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 23 2011 707 AM All the Weepy Horses Steven Spielbergs corny saccharine War Horse breached my emotional defenses. By Dana Stevens Jeremy Irvine in War Horse Still (c) 2011 - DreamWorks II Distribution Co. LLC. Steven Spielbergs War Horse (DreamWorks) a deliberate throwback to a long-dormant style of unabashedly sentimental Hollywood filmmaking is so completely what you would expect it to be that it comes back around and transcends its own cliches. In this 146-minute WWI epic there are plucky tenant farmers and sneering oppressive landlords. There are idealistic youths whose character is tested by the crucible of war. There is my right hand to God a comic-relief goose. Above all there are horses those animals whose kinetic grace seems intimately bound up with the history of cinema from Eadweard Muybridges racehorse photographs to John Fords equine-crisscrossed landscapes. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. If you dont thrill to the sight of a horse galloping across a green meadow with a beautiful young rider on its back--if you believe (wrongly) that National Velvet is just a sappy kids movie--then you may not be susceptible to the curious power of War Horse. Granted this Spielbergian take on the horse epic doesnt seem destined to become an enduring classic a la National Velvet. It lacks that films earthy humor and the specificity of its characterizations--not to mention that Jeremy Irvine the perfectly adequate actor who plays the horse-mad teenage hero Albert Narracott is no young Elizabeth Taylor. But like National Velvet War Horse--based on a childrens novel and a play of the same name--is a love story about the bond between humans and animals that somehow sneaks past the viewers emotional defenses. One minute youre rolling your eyes at its corniness; the next youre discreetly dabbing at those same eyes with the back of your hand. Writing about Spielbergs other big holiday release The Adventures of Tintin I asked whether the directors fascination with 3-D motion-capture gadgetry might be getting in the way of his usual knack for storytelling. With War Horse Spielberg is back in his comfort zone. Unlike the manic Tintin this film unfolds at a rustic contemplative pace that complements the boy-meets-horse storyline. Advertisement The film begins with Joey a rambunctious untrained half-thoroughbred passing into the care of Alberts father Ted (Pete Mullan) a homesteading farmer in rural England in 1914. Ted is a good man but something of a failure--hes been an alcoholic since returning from the Boer War where he won a medal for participating in whats suggested was an atrocity. When he comes home with an expensive racehorse rather than the plow-pulling draft horse he was supposed to buy Teds practical wife Rosie (Emily Watson) insists that the animal be returned. But their son Albert (Irvine) begs to keep the horse and with hard work manages to tame and train it. In whats surely the most suspenseful plowing sequence ever filmed Albert teaches Joey to pull the plow just in time for the Narracotts farm to escape seizure by their landlord (David Thewlis) a miserly wretch whose son (Robert Emms) is Alberts chief rival. Then to quote a line thats used several times in the film the war takes everything from everyone. As hostilities with the Kaiser break out Joey is sold to a cavalry captain played with old-school panache by Tom Hiddleston. (Alberts goodbye to his pet may be the first occasion youll need that Kleenex.) Later Joey will pass into the care of Emilie (Cecile Buckens)--a little French girl whose saccharine cuteness stands as the movies low point--and eventually into the cruel hands of the German army whose treatment of animals alone would be justification for waging war on them. Meanwhile Albert enlists as a soldier and is soon fighting alongside his former village rival in the trenches of Flanders Field. Spielberg invests considerable screen time in showing trench warfare in all its grisly absurdity dozens of young men huddled in a warren of ditches waiting to be sent out into a barbed-wire maze where they would almost certainly be shot to death. Like Stanley Kubricks great WWI film Paths of Glory War Horse shows how in the senseless butchery of real-life battle terms like courage and cowardice lose their meaning. Though War Horse contains several spectacular battle scenes theres nothing remotely martial about its spirit. Just beneath the movies folksy sweetness lies a powerful and painful critique of war. The battle scenes show little explicit gore but theyre plenty intense enough to make this PG-13-rated fare too frightening for young children. I wont further elaborate on the obstacles that keep horse and boy apart for the majority of War Horse. If you plan to see the movie you dont want to know and if you couldnt be dragged kicking and screaming into a Christmas-released Spielberg weepie you dont care. But if the subject matter leaves you cold Ill make one last argument for the film on aesthetic grounds. War Horse looks incredible; it was shot on film stock (a technology that sadly is fast becoming an antiquarian novelty) by Spielbergs longtime cinematographer Janusz Kaminski and the images have what I can only describe as a wonderful texture. They also have intense color deep gemlike greens and reds with black shadows out of an old master painting. One shot near the end a view of the road leading up to the Narracotts farm at sunset is almost surreally extreme in its oversaturated beauty like an old Technicolor movie remembered in a fever dream. (John Williams score which ladles on the strings Max Steiner-style only contributes to the impression of mid-20th-century cinematic grandeur.) This unabashedly sincere evocation of an old-Hollywood ending could be seen as a manipulative gesture on Spielbergs part or a loving one. How you see it may serve as a litmus test for your tolerance of War Horse a movie thats manipulative and loving at the same time. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

By David Denby Meryl Streep plays Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.   Credit Illustration by Gerald Scarfe As Margaret Thatcher in old age--confined to her home and afflicted with dementia--Meryl Streep turns senescence into poetry. Apart from the great Lear interpreters Streep in ""The Iron Lady"" has given us the best impression weve had of a potentate suffering from loss of power and fear of madness. The anxiety of forgetfulness crosses her brow in a flutter; she hesitates before speaking and then gathering her breath pulls an imperative out of the cobwebs. Her eyes darting around corners tell us that Thatcher is still alert to any challenge to her authority. Despite Streeps eloquence and wit however ""The Iron Lady"" is seriously misconceived. It would be hard no doubt for any team of British filmmakers to deal with a figure as masterful virulent and divisive as Thatcher but this bio-pic written by Abi Morgan and directed by Phyllida Lloyd is an oddly unsettled compound of glorification and malice. It whirls around restlessly and winds up nowhere. The movie is framed by--and a good forty per cent of it is taken up with--Thatcher meandering from one thing to another in her house watching family videos talking to her husband Denis (Jim Broadbent) who has been dead for eight years. She is unable to sort out reality from hallucination past from present necessary tasks from unnecessary. Thatcher the only woman to become Prime Minister of Britain is a battler who changed the countrys economy and its culture. She may have been wrong and personally dislikable even insufferable but why undermine her in this way? In part the movie celebrates in brief flashbacks what was remarkable about Margaret Roberts the daughter of a Lincolnshire grocer who entered politics at twenty-four and faced down withering gender and class prejudice from the local Tory nabobs. Alexandra Roach the actress who plays young Margaret has a slight overbite and staring blue eyes that suggest an unnerving singleness of purpose. Even as Margaret accepts a marriage proposal from the charming Denis (Harry Lloyd) shes strenuous and awkward--but also intelligent and forthright. In the nineteen-seventies she becomes a minister in the Cabinet of Edward Heath and Streep takes over turning Thatcher into a ruthless scourge of what she believes to be Conservative weakness. When she runs for Party leader she allows her hair to be teased into a lofty blond arc a sort of cotton-candy diadem. Her speech with training gets heavier and slower the emphasis landing on selected morally instructive syllables like a hammer hitting an anvil. The movie might have been titled ""The Iron Voice."" The clangorous insistence of it drives you crazy. Over and over she says the same things privatize industry bust the trade unions take responsibility for yourself. The filmmakers substitute personal assertion for politics as if Thatchers voice itself had altered the behavior of millions. Its impossible to tell how much of what she says is an accurate reading of the state of affairs and how much of it mere ideology--or how effective any of it was. Did her policies lead to the economic resurgence of the eighties? (No mention is made of North Sea oil.) In a particularly confused bit of sequencing the filmmakers make it seem that Britains enormous economic growth spurt was brought about by victory in the Falklands War in 1982. How? Morgan and Lloyd appear to object to everything about Thatcher except her early determination to stand up to men. But gumption turned into contempt and it would have been interesting to see the stages. The directorial flourishes illustrating Thatchers predominance come off as glibly sarcastic the male ministers are shot from her point of view circling around her and then backing away like livestock or running after her musical-comedy style as she rushes through the halls of Parliament. Near the end Streep pressing even harder underlines Thatchers pleasure in humiliating her Cabinet. Its a tough honest performance yet Streep has lent herself to a project of revenge against the character she plays. When Margaret accepts Deniss proposal she swears that she will not end her life washing a teacup. At the conclusion of the movie she is standing at a sink doing exactly that. This may pass for irony but its an impoverished and low-minded irony. Most of us will end up washing cups. But Margaret Thatcher smashed a lot of china before her piteous final chapter. In Steven Spielbergs ""War Horse"" the British cavalry swords drawn charges out of a hayfield at daybreak gallops across an open plain and overruns a German field camp. It is 1914 in Quievrechain France near the Belgian border. As Spielberg cuts back and forth between the armed British and the terrified Germans we realize that hes re-created a famous scene of Arab legions streaming into a Turkish encampment from his favorite movie ""Lawrence of Arabia."" But then triumph changes to something else--to the horror of a modern ""Charge of the Light Brigade."" German machine guns are waiting in the woods just behind the camp and most of the cavalry including the horses gets cut down. The sequence mixes vainglory and tragedy and it makes us think that Spielberg could have made a great First World War movie. ""War Horse"" has epic scenes of armies marching through damp woods and fighting in mucky trenches yet its essentially an animal story or to be more precise a boy-meets-horse story. In paradisal green Devon a clean-limbed English youth Albert (Jeremy Irvine) raises a bay colt he calls Joey. When his father sells Joey to a British officer Albert enlists and searches for the horse in the slaughterhouse of France. The movie is a series of pictorially splendid set pieces interlarded with broad rural and army comedy. Apart from the battle scenes much of ""War Horse"" has the feeling of nineteen-fifties family entertainment--its leisurely hearty sentimental overexplicit. There are village rowdies and plainspoken women. There is a troublesome goose that nips at mens trousers. German soldiers as well as British try to protect Joey. We get the point the concern for a wonderful animal partly redeems the carnage. But that idea is weakened by a huge literal-minded production. ""War Horse"" began life as Michael Morpurgos young-adult novel written from the point of view of the horse who turns out to have complex feelings and a decent prose style. From there it became a startling and powerful spectacle mounted by the National Theatre of Great Britain the production now being staged at Lincoln Center. Onstage each horse is a large puppet a concatenation of cane silk cables and gears worked by two men beneath the frame and one at the side operating the head and the neck. The audience becomes entranced precisely by the means of making the spectacle an absorption that aided by menacing sound and flashing light focusses attention on the devastation of war and by contrast the horsiness of a horse--the rearing twitching and nuzzling through which its nobility and affection pour out. The purity of intention behind the artifice is intensely moving. We never think to ask why a nineteen-year-old boy is so obsessed with a horse or why the entire production is devoted to an animal while ten million men are dying all around him. But when Spielberg does the story realistically with scenes of butchery and mud it seems trivial even a little daft the war stops the armies and the trenches and the hospitals are stilled so that the boy and the animal can find each other. The horses themselves are magnificent and maybe thats reason enough to see the movie. But ""War Horse"" is a bland bizarrely unimaginative piece of work. ""Mission Impossible--Ghost Protocol"" tries to out-Bond the Bonds and out-Bourne the Bournes. The movie is sheer hurtling mechanism--the entire world in motion--and its great silly fun. Brad Bird who directed the Pixar classics ""The Incredibles"" and ""Ratatouille"" has gone live-action for the first time. Working with the renowned cinematographer Robert Elswit Bird pushes his cast through as many preposterous scrapes as possible and at times he attains the freedom of animation with real flesh and crashing metal. He seems particularly obsessed with falling or the fear of falling Tom Cruise scales the worlds tallest building (the spindly Burj Khalifa in Dubai) gripping with electronic gecko gloves one of which appears to have a dying battery. Cruise runs a lot which is just as well since hes now so tensed and will-driven as an actor that no one can write a real part for him. The plot is trivial the world is in danger of being destroyed by a ""nuclear extremist"" (as opposed to a ""nuclear moderate""?). Cruise has to stop him. See the movie on an IMAX screen if you can--the induced vertigo is exciting though you may feel that youre holding your stomach in your hands.

By David Edelstein Published Dec 23 2011 ShareThis (Photo From top Andrew Cooper/Courtesy of Dreamworks; Francois Duhamel/Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures; Neal Preston/Courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox) In 1982 the British author Michael Morpurgo wrote War Horse a book for younger readers that portrayed the suffering of World War Ion all sidesthrough the eyes of a horse. Joey as hes called begins on a farm in Devon but is conscripted by British forces seized by Germans after a bloody battle adopted by a Belgian girl taken back by Germans and on and on through 1918 when the horse ends up amid the corpse-strewn trenches of no-mans-land. Despite the barbarous milieu Morpurgos prose is modest and uninflected. You discover for example that a noble officer has been killed only when Joey realizes that he is riderless. In 2007 Nick Stafford developed a stage version in which Joey was a life-size puppet with beautifully delineated musculature. The puppets their handlers in view added a distance that was occasionally at odds with the sentimental story. But it was terrific theater. See More Movie Reviews  The Adventures of Tintin  The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo  Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol  Young Adult Steven Spielbergs film of War Horse has no distancing devices or puppets and returns Morpurgos novel to its roots. To say its a family filmfor kids 13 and upis no slight. The horror isnt minimized but Spielberg pulls back from the grisly bombardment of Saving Private Ryan. He aims for a limpid old-fashioned style that puts him firmly in the square category beside contemporaries with their jittery cameras and splatter (most of them imitating Private Ryan). Its the restraint that makes War Horse remarkable. Spielberg shows you enough to understand that what youre watchingmachine guns mustard gas bodies stretching into the distancewas unprecedented. And amid the incomprehensible slaughter its a horse that reminds these warriors of their humanity. Said horse is purchased at auction by the drunken farmer Narracott (Peter Mullan) after a bidding war with his landlord the upshot of which is that theres no money for rent. Bloody paradoxical victory As often happens in Spielbergs work its the sensitive son Albert (Jeremy Irvine) who must take over for his father and the films first section affirms the boys belief that this animal is special. With the troops departure the point of view passes to Joey and his new master (Tom Hiddleston) a gentleman captain who engages in a friendly riding contest with a major (Benedict Cumberbatch) atop a black steed called Topthorn. Tallyho pip pip death to the Kaiser The British have no notion of what awaits them and their cavalry charge through the tall wheat is both lyrical and ghastly. Spielberg proves that aestheticizing horror doesnt mean cheapening or falsifying it. When two teenagers are later executed the camera rises behind a turning windmill one of its blades obscuring the instant of death. Its among the most merciful depictions of murder Ive seen yet still unspeakable. It casts a shadow over the respite that follows in a Belgian farmhouse where a girl (Celine Buckens) lives with her embittered grandfather (the extraordinary Niels Arestrup). The old man knows he cant protect the child that war will take everything. Spielberg has been ridiculed for shooting his actors from below against impossibly Spielbergian skies and a denouement that lays the love on copiously. But theres nothing simpleminded about how he uses movie magic as a spell to dispel nihilism to save us from the worst of ourselves by summoning up the best. Never lacking nerve novelist Jonathan Safran Foer leaped on the opportunity presented by 9/11 for his messy Extremely Loud amp; Incredibly Close which weds a modern American trauma to themes he explored in Everything Is Illuminated. There are multiple narrators but the central figure is 9-year-old Oskar Schell struggling to live through the loss of his dad Thomas in the World Trade Center. Thomas devised puzzles and scavenger hunts to force his fearful son out into the world and Oskar becomes convinced theres a vital message at the finish line of his dads final challenge. Broken or cryptic communications between damaged parents and kids show up all through the book along with memories of Dresden and more gratuitously Hiroshima. I often wished Oskars turns of phrase (and insistence on wearing white and carrying a tambourine) were less cute until I realized that cute is Foers mode of rhetoricand when it works he finds sneakily poetic ways of evoking our longing for a lost past. Stephen Daldrys film eliminates the other perspectives along with some of the boys irritating tics (i.e. the white wardrobe) and homes in on a middle ground between jumpy postmodernism and Oscar-bait uplift. He succeeds although once he strips away the gimmicks and appends an inspirational ending whats left is a tearjerker that doesnt fully earn the right to use such terrible images. The first thing onscreena body falling in slow motionmade me want to flee too much horror too fast. The other wrenching device is a series of six answering-machine messages left by Thomas (Tom Hanks) from the burning tower his assurances increasingly unconvincing. For reasons only later apparent Oskar (Thomas Horn) replaces the machine and lies to his mother (Sandra Bullock).

For a while the judge indulges their anger which is compounded by hurt. ""My finding"" he finally says ""is that your problem is a small problem. Please sign here and good day."" The judge is no fool. Neither is anyone else in this contemporary masterpiece from Iran; everyone has their reasons. But the couples problem isnt small at least not for them and their ensuing separation opens up a succession of fissures chasms and moral dilemmas that define an entire society. Watch a clip of ""A Separation"" directed by Asghar Farhadi and starring Leila Hatami and Peyman Maadi. The film was Irans official submission to the 2012 Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language film. (Video/Photo Sony Pictures Classics) Thematic sweep and dramatic specificity are the movies hallmarks with the one always growing out of the other. The marriage is beset by fatefully conflicting circumstances. Simin the wife wants the family to seek a better life abroad for the sake of their 11-year-old daughter Termeh. Nader the husband refuses to leave Iran; hes taking care of his father whos impaired by Alzheimers and wont consent to Termeh living elsewhere with her mother. Soon the dire requirements of home care force Nader to hire a caregiver Razieh who comes to the task with her impish little daughter Somayeh in tow and with religious strictures that contribute to a terrifying series of events in which the fabric of modernity is torn asunder and the line between truth and falsehood shifts and blurs. (Before naming names let me say that the members of the cast represent ensemble naturalistic acting at its finest. They include Leila Hatami as Simin; Peyman Maadi as Nader; Sarina Farhadi--shes the filmmakers daughter--as Termeh; Sareh Bayat as Razieh; Ali-Asghar Shahbazi as Naders father; Kimia Hosseini as Raziehs daughter; and Shahab Hosseini as Raziehs husband.) ENLARGE Leila Hatami as Simin in A Separation Sony Pictures Classics When admirers asked Mack Sennett how he went about creating his classic silent comedies he would describe the basic principle as ""One thing leads to another."" Far from being a comedy ""A Separation"" is an enthralling drama--with some kinship to ""Kramer vs. Kramer""--and the subtitled Persian dialogue is fluent and copious. All the same one thing leads to another with such ease and inexorable logic that the script could have been created by the filmmaker taking dictation from the people on screen. And as long as Ive invoked the name of Mack Sennett I should also note that everyone having their reasons is a maxim most famously enunciated by Jean Renoir who might have recognized his own spaciousness of spirit in the films generosity toward its conflicting and conflicted characters. Simin has beauty on her side though not always unvarnished truth when shes working her marital stratagems. Nader comes on as a hard case slow to smile and quick to criticize; only gradually does he reveal warmth and humor along with a willingness to fudge crucial facts when coming clean might court disaster that he doesnt deserve. The caregiver Razieh is a picture of piety--literally so since she has the face of a Madonna--but the secrets she chooses to keep may destroy lives. The daughter Termeh watches and listens while seeking her own truth in what ultimately becomes a chastening story of her coming of age. Raziehs husband Hodjat emerges as the films most frightening presence and yet at one and the same time its most compelling figure. He comes on as a religious fanatic but what we learn about him illuminates ever so affectingly the fundamental separation in todays Iran between the secular bourgeois class and the religious working class. ""A Separation"" reaches American screens--and joins the Oscar race as Irans official entry--at a time of escalating tension between the two nations. Whats more one of Irans most prominent--and provocative--filmmakers Jafar Panahi is currently in prison after the Iranian government sentenced him to six years of incarceration and a 20-year ban on any activities connected with making movies. Why then did the authorities put their stamp of approval on Mr. Farhadis film? He was asked that question at last summers Telluride Film Festival. ""Censorship in a country like mine"" he replied ""is a little bit like autumn weather. There may be rain in the morning then sun later. I can only guess that my film came before the censors when the sun was shining. It may also have helped that I havent judged anyone in it."" The latter point is essentially true though he does pass one judgment in a way that may have escaped the censors attention (or for all we know about the internecine workings of a secretive government may have been noted with tacit approval). In the films intertwined wars--between the couples as well as the spouses--superior wisdom is clearly judged to lie not with either of the rigid prideful husbands but with Naders wife Simin who makes an impassioned plea for the peaceful resolution of both conflicts. Does that constitute an oblique comment on the state of affairs between two hostile states? Maybe yes maybe no but the main thing about Mr. Farhadis film is vivid humanity. ""A Separation"" is its own shining light. Watch a clip of Steven Speilbergs new film ""War Horse"" starring Jeremy Irvine. (Video/Photo DreamWorks) War Horse Steven Spielberg has fashioned an impressive entertainment and an occasionally stirring one from source material with a singular pedigree--Michael Morpurgos short novel told from the horses point of view about courage and endurance in the face of horrific suffering during World War I. The book couched in a spare style to engage young readers owed its success to the power of imagination. So did Nick Staffords stage adaptation whose life-size equine puppets moved many theater goers to tears sometimes in spite of themselves. The screen version adapted by Lee Hall and Richard Curtis is a horse of a different aesthetic. It depends on our empathy for Joey--the gallant creature taken from a Devon farm to serve with British forces in France--but not so much on our imagination since Mr. Spielberg and his cinematographer Janusz Kaminski supply a vast bounty of visual details. The result is a film that may stay in the minds eye longer than it lingers in the heart. ENLARGE Jeremy Irvine and the War Horse DreamWorks Pictures The production is never spare--the story starts with gorgeous vistas that evoke the Hollywood style of a bygone day--but the pace is agreeably leisurely at first. Jeremy Irvine makes a strong screen debut as Albert the farm boy Joey must leave behind. Peter Mullan and Emily Watson are Alberts parents. The cast includes Niels Arestrup Tom Hiddleston and Benedict Cumberbatch. When the action moves to France where millions of humans and horses alike are fodder for cannons the battle sequences are less graphic than those in ""Saving Private Ryan"" but they make an eloquent case for the unspeakable bestiality of war and the nobility of wordless beasts. The Iron Lady Watch a clip from The Iron Lady a new film about the life of Margaret Thatcher starring Meryl Streep. Clip courtesy of Weinstein Co. Meryl Streep as Margaret Thatcher is the main reason to see ""The Iron Lady"" which was directed by Phyllida Lloyd--not just the main reason but the raison detre of an otherwise misconceived movie. By now Ms. Streeps gift for getting into her characters throats is the stuff of legend; never mind that shes also a great actress. Channeling Julia Child was eerie enough and funny in the bargain. This time she summons up the voice and spirit of Britains former prime minister both in Mrs. Thatchers earlier years and clouded age and the effect goes beyond eerie to phenomenal and authoritative. Close your eyes--or even keep them open--and the Iron Ladys time has come again. ENLARGE Meryl Streep as Margaret Thatcher in The Iron Lady. The Weinstein Company In reality of course her time has not ended though many years have passed since she was a figure on the world stage. At the age of 86 Mrs. Thatcher is living a private life in declining health which raises the question of intrusiveness if not outright exploitativeness on the part of a movie that depicts her in present tense as severely diminished by memory loss if not outright dementia. Other sections of ""The Iron Lady"" find her in the fullness of her influence or more interesting still en route to political power as a younger woman with a growing sense of her own destiny. But Abi Morgans time-hopping patchwork of a script takes a blandly nonpartisan approach to one of the most controversial as well as influential politicians in British history. And moments of genuine poignancy having to do with memories of love and the ravages of age are diluted by the directors penchant for cinematic effects that play like repurposed Fellini. If only the film as a whole deserved the brilliance of its star. DVD Focus ENLARGE ""The Circle (2000) Jafar Panahis ""The Circle"" in Persian with English subtitles is a stunning drama about the desperate state of women in Iran. That Mr. Panahi took on the censors is heroic. That he has been mercilessly punished for his convictions is unconscionable. ""The Circle"" presents fragmentary portraits of women as theyd never been seen in the modern Iranian cinema. Mostly they are women who have just gotten out of prison for unspecified crimes only to find themselves in the larger prison of a repressive society. The film is hard to find but used DVDs occasionally turn up on Amazon. Offside (2006) Mr. Panahis charming comedy falls between small and slight yet takes on a big subject with great zest--not just the plight of Iranian women but those who happen to be soccer fans and are excluded from the nations stadiums even though they may be equal to Iranian men in their passion for the sport. The heroines are a group of young Tehrani women whove been busted for trying to crash a World Cup qualifying match against Bahrain. The films subtexts are the stupidity of authority and the hypocrisy of discrimination. ""Offside"" is entertaining and edifying to boot. The Bridges of Madison County (1995) Meryl Streep is Francesca Johnson an Italian war bride whose fires are banked in her middle age but far from out. Clint Eastwood is Robert Kincaid the still photographer whose waters run deep. Ms. Streep makes her character known in no time flat. Intelligence humor blocked ambition self-irony--theyre all contained in Francescas quick response when Robert asks if she has any plans for the afternoon ""I was just going to have some iced tea and then...split the atom but that can wait."" Richard LaGravenese adapted Robert James Wallers outlandishly popular novella.

"War Horse (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review War Horse (PG-13) Steven Spielbergs rousing heartbreaking adventure is an instant classic. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com12/23/2011 Editor rating 4 There are two kinds of Steven Spielberg movies The ones in which the filmmaker is completely engaged and invested  (Schindlers List Close Encounters of the Third Kind Raiders of the Lost Ark) and the ones in which he lost interest in halfway through and just plowed ahead until they were completed (Always Hook Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull). Just because Spielberg puts his heart into a picture doesnt guarantee it will turn out well (for more on this see 1941). But his enthusiasm and excitement glows in every single frame of War Horse. There isnt a moment in the movie where you dont feel Spielbergs passion and this time the film is worthy of his enthusiasm. Its a knockout. Michael Morpurgos 1982 childrens novel about the bond between a boy and his horse during World War I already spawned a stage adaptation that racked up accolades and awards. The movie written by Lee Hall and Richard Curtis incorporates elements from both the book and the play The horse no longer narrates the story but he remains the central character. Albert (played by newcomer Jeremy Irvine) is the kid from a ramshackle farm in the British countryside who raises the horse as a colt and names him Joey. Alberts parents (Peter Mullen and Emily Watson) gradually take to the horse with the same affection as the boy does. But a greedy landlord is threatening to foreclose on the familys farm and when World War I breaks out Albert cant keep his father from selling Joey to the British military. The first half-hour of War Horse is slow and deliberate and defiantly earnest - a conventional boy-and-his-dog story complete with a honking comic-relief goose used as the foundation for an epic. Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski who has shot all of Spielbergs movies since 1993 employs grandly artificial lighting and suffused colors to give the scenes the look of a pop-up storybook. And then the war comes and changes everything. War Horse is aggressively episodic. The plot is chopped up into chapters that segue into each other using Joey as the protagonist. Soon after leaving home the horse is galloping into battle carrying British troops pulling heavy artillery through mud for German soldiers and bringing brief solace to ordinary people caught in the crossfire. Eventually hes racing through trenches and dodging bullets and bombs and the images are extraordinary and terrifying. War Horse uses Joeys experiences to illustrate war in all its facets and the film uses his point of view to rise above the usual business of heroes and villains and historical and political subtexts. The war is almost an abstraction Spielberg is interested only in the toll it takes not what led up to it. But the movie - and this is critical - never anthropomorphizes its four-legged hero. Spielberg uses camera angles and shrewd editing to get real performances from his star (six different horses were used to play Joey). But the movie resists the temptation to saddle him with anything resembling human emotions. War Horse is a grand sweeping film about a simple precious idea Even in the midst of hell on Earth our innate compassion for animals can sometimes override  hatred and fear. Some people may roll their eyes at that description. But Spielberg doesnt care and his unwavering unapologetic conviction is one of the chief strengths of the movie. With the one-two punch of The Adventures of Tintin and War Horse Spielberg cements his status as the best director of large-scale action of his generation. War Horse doesnt linger on the horrors of battle the way Saving Private Ryan did The violence is practically bloodless with little explicit gore. But the intensity remains the same. In a remarkable sequence in which British forces charge at German troops hiding in the woods the camera hurtles alongside the soldiers on horseback as they hack through the enemies theyve caught off guard - then runs ahead of them to show us the cannon machine-gun cannons about to turn the tide of battle. A long scene depicting the surreal insanity of trench warfare is horrifying and nightmarish and an absolute tour de force of filmmaking Spielberg dares to invoke Paths of Glory then comes up with a few ideas even Kubrick never thought of. The plot of War Horse stretches over several years and eventually Albert and Joey are reunited but under the most tragic of circumstances. The movie is filled with fleeting images and small details that sear themselves into your head such as the hands of a frightened soldier that tremble so badly he cant pull the pin on the grenade that will save his life. And although this is a family-friendly picture Spielberg never sugarcoats the reality of war. There is great death and horror and tragedy here. In its final moments War Horse returns to the larger-than-life style the movie opened with including gorgeous skies that look like they were drawn by hand and compositions that look like paintings. Spielberg tips his hat to everything from John Ford to Gone with the Wind to David Lean but never at the expense of his own imprint. This is a Spielberg movie in all the best ways right down to its intrinsic rejection of cynicism. The films unabashed embrace of operatic sentiment has been rejected by some as too schmaltzy or hokey or old-fashioned.  But when did old-fashioned become such a bad word? This is a beautiful generous thrilling picture with a gentle spirit a profoundly humanistic core and the same depth of feeling as E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. That might make War Horse the object of hate and ridicule in certain circles. From here it already feels like an instant classic.

This two-and-a-half-hour Great War saga with an equine hero is partly John Ford-style British Isles claptrap and partly a grueling tale of mans inhumanity to man (and also horse). Its likely to seem too dark for family audiences -- I certainly would not suggest bringing children younger than 10 or 11 -- and too treacly for many grown-ups. ""War Horse"" is certainly a movie for Spielbergs fans for those who are enraptured by the blend of childhood yearning and adult grief that characterizes his mature work and also by his film-school-on-steroids effort to re-create the look mood and feeling of bygone cinematic eras.Of course one could also offer a more cynical interpretation and read this boy-meets-horse allegory as middle-of-the-road Oscar bait of the highest order a picturesque period weeper designed to reduce 70-something Beverly Hills-dwelling Academy voters to tears. Listen I have gravely mixed feelings about Spielberg but Im not going there. Im sure he still welcomes awards and good reviews and all that but at this point in his career Spielberg is pursuing personal goals and everything thats terrific and overly flat and tooth-rottingly sweet about ""War Horse"" reflects that. Its almost a great war movie in one direction and almost a piece of irredeemable cheese in the other and there you have it. Steven Spielberg ladies and gentlemen -- the director of ""Jaws"" and ""The Color Purple"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Munich"" and ""The Adventures of Tintin"" (which is competing with ""War Horse"" right now for the Christmas weekend box office) and a forthcoming biopic starring Daniel Day-Lewis as Abraham Lincoln. We arent gonna change the guy now.""War Horse"" officially begins in the early 20th century in Devon a rural county in southwestern England where a drunken and obstinate tenant farmer named Ted Narracott (the terrific Scottish actor Peter Mullan) buys a beautiful thoroughbred at auction largely to spite his flinty landlord (David Thewlis). But any resemblance to the real Britain circa 1910 is accidental; this part of ""War Horse"" is really set in the imaginary version of places like Devon as mythologized by Hollywood notably in John Ford classics like ""How Green Was My Valley"" and ""The Quiet Man."" (I am aware that those movies are set in Wales and Ireland respectively; those distinctions are lost on most American viewers and in the cinematic context they dont much matter.)Janusz Kaminskis photography of the storybook settings -- ""War Horse"" was shot entirely in England both on location and in two different studios -- is predictably gorgeous and depending on your taste the archetypal characters will either charm you to pieces or make your fillings pop out. In addition to Mullans boozy dad a Boer War veteran who refuses to talk about his past and Thewlis mustachioed frock-coated Mr. Moneybags we have Emily Watson as the nagging loving Mum perennially on her knees scrubbing things and young Jeremy Irvine as Albert their ambitious only son who sees the handsome horse as a symbol of the familys brighter future. (Officially the screenplay by Lee Hall and Richard Curtis is based on Michael Morpurgos original 1982 novel although it clearly borrows its narrative approach from Nick Staffords Broadway show.)Its Albert who temporarily saves the Narracott family from eviction by harnessing Joey -- thats the noble thoroughbreds name -- and training him to be a plow horse during a drenching rainstorm and if that seems like an utterly ridiculous notion to anybody who knows anything about farming and horses well its just that kind of story. Its not like the other stuff that happens in this section of ""War Horse"" is less comic and picturesque and improbable not to mention (to my taste) vastly irritating. But war is coming in faraway Europe and while everyone keeps insisting that the Hun will soon be driven out of Belgium and itll all be over in no time we know better. Despite Alberts heartfelt pleas Joey is sold to Capt. Nicholls (Tom Hiddleston who played Scott Fitzgerald in ""Midnight in Paris"" and Loki in ""Thor"") a handsome cavalry officer who assures Albert ""man to man"" that hell take good care of Joey and bring him home if he possibly can. You Might Also Like This is the moment when ""War Horse"" makes an abrupt shift from one kind of old-fashioned movie to another leaving behind ""How Green Was My Quiet Darby OGill"" and turning into ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" or even ""Paths of Glory."" Its also the moment when I should warn you that talking about the rest of the movie involves giving away certain plot developments -- and its the moment when unprepared families who havent read reviews like this one will find out that ""War Horse"" definitely isnt suitable for most young children. Nicholls is an admirable and likable character an old-school English officer who believes in honor and duty and has no idea that the world order he represents is about to come crashing down. He wont be able to keep his promise to Albert because he isnt coming home himself with or without Joey. When Nicholls and his cavalrymen realize that theyre riding toward a line of German machine-gunners its one of the most terrifying sequences in all of Spielbergs oeuvre and even more so because the director avoids any explicit bloodshed. I suppose the sudden shift in mode and mood is precisely the point of ""War Horse."" Rural characters like Albert and Joey seemingly locked into their lives in an unchanging Britain are suddenly uprooted and thrown into a broiling chaos where survival is largely a matter of good luck. Joey goes from Nicholls to a pair of young German soldiers who try to desert and then to a French farm where an ailing grandpa (Niels Arestrup) is trying to keep his treasured granddaughter (Celine Buckens) safe at a place and time when lovely teenage girls were at terrible risk. He is confiscated once again and thrust into service hauling artillery a task few horses could stand for more than a month or two.In a vivid nightmarish sequence that unfortunately isnt a dream Joey careens among the trenches exploding shells and corpses (human and equine alike) of the German front lines at one point coming face to face with a primitive tank the animal power of old Europe facing a mechanized monster of the new one. In the films moral and visual centerpiece Joey gets entangled in barbed wire smack in the middle of No Mans Land between the German and British front lines and a couple of soldiers -- distracted from their task of murdering each other by the plight of an injured animal -- emerge from the trenches to see if they can rescue him. Its magnificently staged and powerfully affecting and in true Spielberg fashion its all rather too much. Too much allegorical and symbolic weight too much emotion projected onto a handsome animal who cannot in fact express it and too much prefiguring of the miraculous reunion we all know is coming but which (for better and for worse) cannot undo everything that has happened.

Martin Scorsese celebrated the birth of cinema in Hugo; Michel Hazanavicius paid tribute to the transition from the silents to the talkies in The Artist; Nicolas Winding Refn even claims to have paid an oblique homage to the 80s oeuvre of Molly Ringwald in Drive. Not to be left out Steven Spielbergs War Horse harks back to an old-fashioned mode of filmmaking too -- the sweeping romantic Hollywood epic. That results in some classically picturesque moments including a gorgeously constructed visual quote of Gone with the Wind in the movies closing seconds but more often the director winds up channeling live-action Disney films of the 50s and 60s. Understandable impulse The story of War Horse first a childrens book and then a hit on Broadway and West End stages has the heartstring-tugging contours of those mid-century Disney family adventures which often centered around beloved and extraordinary animals -- Old Yeller or the homeward-bound pets of The Incredible Journey -- and plucky kids like Pollyanna and Toby Tyler. This tale features Joey a strong and intelligent stallion born amid the rolling and rocky picture-book hills of southwestern England and Albert Narracott (Jeremy Irvine) who forms an unbreakable bond with Joey from the moment he first lays eyes on him as a willful colt. Much like Anna Sewells classic novel Black Beauty War Horse is essentially told from Joeys perspective as he is transferred from owner to owner He begins as beloved companion to Albert and unlikely workhorse on the Narracott farm then makes his way to the fields of battle in France as a cavalry horse in World War I and then to the care of a kindly old French jelly-maker and his granddaughter. Eventually he will see some truly horrific service back in the trenches this time on the German side. i Capt. Nicholls (Tom Hiddleston left) and Sgt. Perkins (Geoff Bell) prepare to take Joey away to the battlefield. Andrew Cooper/Disney hide caption toggle caption Andrew Cooper/Disney Capt. Nicholls (Tom Hiddleston left) and Sgt. Perkins (Geoff Bell) prepare to take Joey away to the battlefield. Andrew Cooper/Disney The tonal shifts between those segments can be rather jarring. The first portion of the film on those Devonshire hillsides is the most evocative of classic Disney. It even includes an anthropomorphized goose who comically harasses unwanted guests on the Narracott farm. Not least among these is the evil landlord (David Thewlis playing so close to type that he may as well be twirling a mustache) who threatens to take the farm away from Alberts family when they fall on hard times -- hard times that are actually the result of Alberts alcoholic impulsive fathers spending too much to purchase Joey. The kid-friendly storybook tone heightened by weirdly artificial lighting choices from longtime Spielberg cinematographer Janusz Kaminski feels particularly discordant given the dark and surprisingly violent turn the film takes once Joey makes good on the films title. The battlefield sections are brilliantly staged and by far the highlight of the movie. Spielberg knows how to film warfare better than any other living director and there are images here -- troops moving through breeze-swayed grasses on their way to a sneak attack a firing squads target just blocked out by the blades of a spinning windmill at the moment the triggers are pulled -- that rank among his most unforgettable. Unfortunately theyre couched in a film that feels of multiple minds about what it wants to be. Its not that a film cant be lighthearted family fare a gritty war epic and a weepie all at once; the problem is that here those elements feel strictly compartmentalized -- and calculated. Sure War Horse is bound to elicit some tears. But its like those holiday coffee commercials with the long-absent child returning for a surprise Christmas-morning visit with Spielberg taking the easy road to emotional response Insert tab A into slot B and hand out hankies at the door.

Thats what this season in movies has felt like at times. And audiences have been the beneficiaries of this ""so you think you can make a bold entertainment"" throwdown. Theres Martin Scoreses ""Hugo"" in which the auteur of gangsters and ardent lover of cinemas history weaves the stories of orphan Hugo Cabret and forgotten movie maverick Georges Melies into an often stunning yarn. Then theres Michel Hazanavicius ""The Artist"" which opens today. The effervescent charmer isnt merely an homage to cinemas silent era. It is a silent movie. Christmas Day brings ""War Horse"" Steven Spielbergs second entry into the contest. ( His animated ""The Adventures of Tintin"" opened Wednesday.) Robustly entertaining ""War Horse"" brings to the big screen Michael Morpurgos 1982 childrens novel about a young man named Albert his horse Joey and the war that separates them and rends Europe -- the first World War. Last summer the Broadway play won five Tonys including best play. Already a bona fide knockout when it came from London it rendered audiences and critics awestruck with its magnificent puppet star. Anticipating Spielbergs upcoming film New York Times theater critic Ben Brantley wrote in his rave ""But nothing on screen could replicate the specific thrill of watching Joey take on substance and soul out of disparate artificial parts before our eyes."" True. Thankfully trancendence comes in many forms. It must. The gobsmacking wonder of giant puppets tweaking the imagination will have to belong to the stage. Thanks to a talented cast of humans and horses and Spielbergs sure hands on the reins ""War Horse"" is a bold and beneficent ride that takes the measure of war while never losing sight of the abiding amity of human and horse. Albert and Joeys journey together is touching. Their time apart is harrowing especially for Joey. Their friendship begins in unyielding farm country. For reasons hardly rational (based in resentments wholly understandable) English farmer Ted Narracott bids on a horse his landlord wants. Ted needs a beast not a beauty like Joey. The hard-drinking farmer (Peter Mullan) wins the battle but will likely lose the family farm to Lyons (David Thewlis). Son Albert (newcomer Jeremy Irvine) promises to roughen their diamond. Their friendship is cemented in a rock-strewn field. Their separation comes when Joey is drafted by the calvary. Written for the screen by Lee Hall and Richard Curtis ""War Horse"" is sweeping. It limns with visual grace the true and the sentimental. War declared Joey is taken from village to battlefield to French countryside to the wars deadly gas-fogged trenches. It is a deft and humane way of binding ally and enemy. But then animals can do that. Of the 1 million horses estimated to have been pressed into service in the war that did not end all wars 62000 survived. Masterful French actor Niels Arestrup portrays a farmer and doting grandfather who offers Joey a too-terse respite. Of course war meant there was no rest for Joey and his kind-- or anyone else in the midst of the conflagration. War Horse"" is an argument not so much for hope but for fealty -- for big-chested constant heart.

"Movie review War Horse by Steven Spielberg - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review War Horse is the purest sort of love storyThe story of a boy and his horse separated by war is full of beauty and emotion. But the film stumbles in its storytelling.December 23 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Two young brothers make a daring escape from the German army in ""War... (Andrew Cooper DreamWorks )""War Horse"" Steven Spielbergs epic family drama about the enduring connection between a boy and his horse and the Great War that tears them apart has the sweep of a classic John Ford movie the sentiment of Frank Capra and a spirited steed named Joey who will steal your heart. The film itself which opens Sunday is more difficult to love. The emotional signature of the director can be felt from the first frames as he establishes the relationship and the mood of the piece a there will be tears. The setting is rural England on the eve of the First World War the moors and all their harsh beauty made gorgeous by cinematographer Janusz Kaminski a longtime Spielberg collaborator who uses the same painterly touch whether the scene is pastoral or decimated by war. A colt is being born in the field and a teenager who turns out to be Albert Narracott (Jeremy Irvine in his feature film debut) crouches in the distance awed by the sight. His father (Peter Mullan) is a forgotten war hero whose memories have turned him into a drunk. Salt-of-the-earth mum Rosie (Emily Watson) as solid as the ground she stands on has been worn down by the trials of the land and her husbands soggy state. Time passes a slowly. The horse grows up with Albert still looking on at a distance until his dad sent to buy a plow horse comes back with a pub buzz empty pockets and the untrained 2-year-old. Never one to underplay his hand Spielberg leaves little doubt that Alberts and Joeys fates are sealed. War battles other riders and other challenges will come and go but nothing short of death can break their bond. Essentially screenwriters Lee Hall (""Billy Elliot"") and Richard Curtis (""Love Actually"" and the ""Bridget Jones"" films) have given us the purest sort of love story. In structure it follows the three-act basics of most romantic comedies or dramas a they meet they are separated they struggle to find their way back to each other. In tone ""War Horse"" is a symphony in minor key (with composer John Williams playing those chords with a very heavy hand) to the unconditional and unwavering love that animals extend us long a film staple with the distinctive relationship with horses in particular yielding a rich vein that includes ""National Velvet"" ""The Black Stallion"" ""The Horse Whisperer"" ""Seabiscuit"" and countless others. Adapted from the 1982 childrens novel by Michael Morpurgo ""War Horse"" was a sensation on stage from its London premiere in 2009 to its New York opening earlier this year with the horses brought to stunning life as giant puppets. Without those visual theatrics the screenwriters shift more focus on the people that surround Joey their worries and woes trying hard to stack up to the noble steeds. In that the filmmakers have sometimes succeeded and sometimes stumbled with the earlier scenes beautiful but flat and too many subplots ranging from landlords to flirtations that dont pay off. Even Irvine who as Albert is both Joeys soul mate and his destiny isnt given the sort of gravitas needed to seriously break your heart. Things pick up considerably when the colt is sold to the military and with that comes a new string of characters and a series of action set pieces that are as exhilarating as they are devastating. War a battle-hot or postwar cold reality or fantasy a has always brought out the best in Spielberg and so it is with ""War Horse."" A cavalry charge filled with the sound and fury of a hundred soldiers their swords flashing their horses racing breakneck across a field is unbridled passion at top speed. Even the muddy trenches of France its battlefields coiled by barbed wire men hollowed out by the fighting is brought to life with Spielbergian grace. Joeys war years begin with a gentleman soldier Capt. Nicholls (sensitively drawn by Tom Hiddleston) who has promised to care for Alberts horse and spends time between skirmishes making sketches to send back to the boy. In France there is a succession of owners endless forced marches huge German howitzers to haul and other hardships. Whatever happens to the humans in this war-torn devastated landscape it is the animals whose pain we feel most keenly. Which is to say Joey owns nearly every good scene in this movie whether he is being hidden by a charming French farm girl (Celine Buckens) and her grandfather (Niels Arestrup) or in the care of German soldiers everyone ups their game in his presence (with 14 horses used to create that life at various stages). The incredible emotive power of this horse and the way in which the filmmakers were able to translate it on-screen are what stay with you. There is great beauty in ""War Horse"" great power in the emotional journey for both boy and beast if only Spielberg had trusted that we would be able to read between the lines. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESStallion runs to the rescueDecember 25 2003MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesReviewNot_live_webEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/reviews/la-et-war-horse-20111223,0,11617.story?track=rss",200,warhorse13,warhorse,latimes
"War Horse | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; war-horse ) War Horse (United States 2011) December 23 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Over the last 20 years of his career Steven Spielberg has often coupled a crowd-pleasing would-be blockbuster with a more serious-minded project. Thus in 1993 he released Jurassic Park in tandem with Schindlers List. In 1997 there were The Lost World and Amistad. 2005 brought War of the Worlds and Munich. Now we have The Adventures of Tintin and War Horse (released within weeks of each other and possibly competing for the same audience). Of the dramatic films Spielberg has released over the years it can be argued that War Horse is among the least successful. Call it ""lesser Spielberg"" and put it alongside Always and Hook. War Horse is by no means a bad movie but it feels less like the epic it strives to be and more like a loosely connected series of World War I-era vignettes. Its emotional punch doesnt deliver much force; War Horses primary attraction is not the story of how it makes us feel but its impressive re-creation of the Great Wars battlefields and some stunningly beautiful camerawork by cinematographer Janusz Kaminski. War Horse follows the adventures of Joey a horse born and bred in Devon who is the lone equine owned by Albert (Jeremy Irvine); his father Ted (Peter Mullan); and his mother Rose (Emily Watson). When the landowner (David Thewlis) threatens to foreclose on the farm unless the rent is paid Ted sells Joey to army captain Nicholls (Tom Hiddleston) who rides the horse into the early battles of World War I. After Nicholls is killed in action Joey is taken by the Germans. Over the next few years he ends up pulling ambulances and gun wagons and being the pet of a lonely French peasant girl (Celine Buckens) and her grandfather (Niels Arestrup). Once Albert becomes old enough to join the British army he never ceases scouring the front lines for Joey even though the odds of him finding his beloved horse are worse than those of finding a needle in a haystack. The principle difficulty faced by Spielberg and screenwriters Richard Curtis and Lee Hall is related to structure. Michael Morpurgos novel was written from the horses perspective - something difficult to achieve on screen without resulting to Mr. Ed tactics which would have cheapened the production reducing it to self-parody. Only in animated movies can animals talk without appearing foolish. So although the primary character in the movie is Joey War Horse focuses on the human characters during scenes in which the horse is present. This results in a large number of supporting individuals with whom we develop little emotional attachment. To the extent that we have an investment in the movie its related to Joey but developing deep feelings for a screen horse even one that has been anthropomorphized is difficult. Since many of War Horses big emotional moments relate to animals Spielbergs celebrated ability to manipulate audiences is not as effective here as in some of his past endeavors. Compounding the problem is the performance by Jeremy Irvine the actor with the most significant screen time. Irvine making his film debut presents a flat Albert who is difficult to identify or sympathize with. The performance is frequently either too broad or too subdued; maybe thats a drawback of being forced to co-star with a horse. The rest of the cast which includes well-respected character actors Peter Mullan David Thewlis and Emily Watson as well as the veteran French thespian Niels Arestrup is solid in what is decidedly not an actors production. War Horses strength is its depiction of World War I cinematically the most underrepresented conflict of the 20th century. All Quiet on the Western Front remains the most compelling and best-known tale from the trenches but there are few movies (especially recent ones) to stand alongside it. Although Spielberg does not apply the same degree of bloody realism he employed in Saving Private Ryan to War Horse (the latter being designed as a family film) the conflict is effectively presented albeit in a sanitized fashion. World War I was an enigma as modern methods of waging war clashed with archaic ones and technological advances forced changes to the more restrained and ""gentlemanly"" prior rules of engagement. War Horses by their nature were things of the past and millions were killed during the course of the conflict. Spielberg captures these elements as well as any previous filmmaker working in this theater. One scene in particular with a trapped horse being stalked by a tank illustrates the senselessness of using ""old school"" tools in a ""new school"" battle. It is indeed like bringing a knife to a gun fight. War Horse may not succeed as well as might be hoped in generating a powerful emotional response but its historical depiction does an outstanding job of transporting the viewer to the Western Front. Mention must be made of the beauty of the final scene in which the sky burns with oranges reds and yellows. Whether due to natural serendipity or contrived methods the richness and warmth of the colors which suffuse the background add an element of poetry to the moment. These are the kinds of visuals that painters strive to capture; rarely are they conveyed this well on film. John Williams score is the perfect accompaniment to the images Spielberg and Kaminski have assembled. Combined with The Adventures of Tintin War Horse marks Spielbergs return to the directors chair after a brief hiatus to lick his wounds in the wake of the fourth Indiana Jones movie. Although neither film could be considered ""triumphant"" each shows flashes of the elements that have made Spielberg so respected. War Horse is a crowd-pleaser and better than many that bear that name but it is not representative of the filmmaker in peak form. Its a solid respectable effort but not a great one.

"War Horse review Close encounters of the herd kind |       NJ.com comments War Horse review Close encounters of the herd kind Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on December 23 2011 at 700 AM View/Post Comments Albert (Jeremy Irvine) and his horse Joey are featured in this scene from DreamWorks Pictures ""War Horse."" Content dictates style were told. But so does the medium. As a theatrical production ""War Horse"" was pure imagination with every effect an intellectualized leap of faith. You believed those giant two-person puppets were horses. You believed that little pull toy was a real goose that those flashes of light were battlefield explosions. As a movie ""War Horse"" is pure emotion with each moment pulled from you through carefully reproduced facts. These are real horses. Thats a real goose. The farm where we begin and the front lines we go to are made of real mud and sweat and blood. Steven Spielbergs film is good. The play was great. And if youve seen both they provide perfect proof of how theater and cinema are different keys fitting different locks in our secret selves. The story -- which itself comes from a childrens book -- is just as simple and to the point as youd expect. An English boy grows up with and trains a beautiful horse Joey; strapped for cash the boys father sells the horse to the Army for its World War I cavalry. And so enlisting as soon as he can the boy follows his pet to France determined to bring him home. The story is filled with sentiment but sentiment is as different from sentimentality as a home-cooked meal is from fast food. And because sentimentality is simply part of who Spielberg is as a storyteller its part of his ""War Horse"" too. If Spielbergs sentimentality hasnt bothered you before youre likely to put it down to ""style"" here. If it does bother you ... well it will definitely annoy you here. The opening village scenes seem like a memory of watching ""How Green Was My Valley"" on TV; the conclusion set by a spindly fence against a crimson sky looks like a lift from ""Gone With the Wind."" And -- as always -- Spielberg spoonfeeds an audience he doesnt quite trust to get it. Several times the scenario stops for baldly expository dialogue; John Williams score (one of his worst) uses a whimsical brass section for comic moments. (Spielberg shamelessly even cuts to the goose once for a ""funny"" reaction shot.) And yet the movie still works. Because how can you not care for this gorgeous horse with its eternal inscrutable gaze and almost saintly behavior (he not only bears up under human brutality he volunteers for more to save another horse). How can you not be horrified by the front-line carnage -- or hope desperately for a final happy reunion? The actors are immediately believable perhaps because theyre cast so rigidly to type (Emily Watson as suffering mother Peter Mullan as brutal father David Thewlis as nasty landlord). Best is newcomer Jeremy Irvine as the boy who will not abandon his best friend. Meanwhile Spielbergs phenomenal skill for making images remains undiminished. The rows in a piece of knitting dissolve into the furrows in a stony field; mens bodies fly through the air like broken dolls. Some images are too fussed over but every one is striking. So yes like most of Steven Spielbergs movies ""War Horse"" is obvious and tear-jerking and takes at least 10 minutes too long to wrap up. Its incredibly manipulative -- although honestly what popular art isnt? -- and if you tell me you couldnt stand it Ill respect you. But if you insist it never made you tear up even a bit I think Ill trust you just a little less. Ratings note The film contains gory battlefield violence. War Horse (PG-13) Touchstone (146 min.)

Photo Jeremy Irvine is shown in a scene from ""War Horse."" (AP) Its not a knock on Steven Spielberg to say he is historys finest maker of childrens movies. His capacity to evoke simplicity awe beauty and unconditional love are his genius and his vision of the childrens story ""War Horse"" is a gorgeous majestic fable about a boy who yearns to be reunited with his steed. In early 20th-century Devon England we witness the birth of a brown thoroughbred with a diamond-shape white mark on his forehead. Spielberg is confident enough and skilled enough to allow pictures and music to tell the story here and in many other lyrical passages after a reckless alcoholic dad (Peter Mullan who slightly overplays the wretchedness) overpays for the horse at auction risking his entire farm and the wrath of his sensible wife (Emily Watson). The old man is gimpy but his teen boy Albert (Jeremy Irvine) hopes to save the day by teaching this race horse to plow a turnip field. Demands of the landlord (David Thewlis) threaten the entire farm even as larger events threaten the world Its the summer of 1914. A kindly British officer (played with great sensitivity by Tom Hiddleston) buys the horse called Joey with a promise to return him if he can. Soon the lads are dashing off to what they imagine will be a great sporting cavalry charge in France. If anything Spielberg underplays the frivolity with which great nations began World War I and believed they could quickly end it by Christmas but in one of many heartbreaking scenes the master illustrates how Rudyard Kipling ideals were laid waste by ruthless technology. As with many other evocative moments Spielberg tells this chapter with no words though John Williams typically yearning score does plenty to bring home the gravity of whats happening. There is a devastating image of Joey galloping without a rider terrified but somehow determined. Joey (and a friendly rival a black horse whose life Joey repeatedly saves) is first captured by Germans who intend to put him to work then taken for a pet by a French farmer (Niels Arestrup) and his granddaughter Emilie (Celine Buckens). Each of these episodes is a small tidy reminder of the millions of good people on all sides who got caught in the inescapable meat grinder of the Great War. ""The war has taken everything from everyone"" is a refrain heard more than once and it was never truer than in the 1914-1918 conflict which combined senseless underlying causes with previously unimagined ruthlessness. This was more a march of folly than a crusade against evil and Spielbergs film is a poignant plea to recognize one anothers humanity -- through the eyes of the utterly innocent horse whose hard-working spirit endurance and willingness to sacrifice earn it repeated cruel punishment. In its culminating moment -- one of the few scenes that contain much dialogue in an elegantly lean script by Lee Hall and Richard Curtis -- the horse flees madly through the night and gets tangled in barbed wire that amounts to a rough equivalent of Christs crown of thorns. When British and German grunts work together to save Joey the scene cleverly recalls the famous Christmas truce of 1914 in which hundreds of soldiers -- who hours before and hours later would try to kill one another -- crept out of their trenches and played soccer. Above ground and face to face the critical dehumanization of the enemy momentarily became impossible and peace lay dangerously near. Officers put a stop to the cease-fire correctly realizing that their men were one step away from shooting them and going home. Spielbergs film steers scrupulously clear of politics (and will hence be equally marketable in France and Germany). Is he putting sales above story? I dont think so The horse like a child (or the Christlike donkey in the French film ""Au Hasard Balthazar"") is so guileless that it allows us to experience the war on a purely sensory and emotional level. The big brutal battle scene here while not as explicit as ""Saving Private Ryan"" stands with the one in ""Paths of Glory"" as the most visceral re- enactment of trench warfare in cinematic history. (Spielberg also delivers a shot straight out of ""Gone With the Wind."" You cant say he lacks ambition or taste.) The climax in the snow delivers a sense that after the unbearable has been borne there still might be some goodness left. Spielberg is less effective when he tries to tangle with issues. Emotions not words are his medium -- but this is the highest a filmmaker can reach. Its why ""Rocky"" is better than ""All the Presidents Men."" Consider the Coen brothers who after 20 years of irony finally dared reach for the heartstrings last year in the climactic odyssey across the night in ""True Grit."" It was their finest moment. ""War Horse"" has several equally virtuoso sequences and together with the painterly cinematographer Janusz Kaminski Spielberg caps the movie with the most haunting and beautiful images of all a sequence that is as stunning as the finale of ""Shane"" or ""The Searchers."" Those who say they dont make em like they used to must now fall silent.

The music the cinematography the performances and everything else about it has been painstakingly designed to manipulate an emotional response and even though I can see the strings I fall for it every time. With ""War Horse"" -- one of two new Spielberg films opening this week -- I can still see all the strings but theres no pleasure to be had. The director is basically running a con game with composer John Williams and director of photography Janusz Kaminski but theres no joy in being scammed. With the exception of a few lovely scenes its a hollow and bombastic piece of work clobbering you over the head with its epic-ness when its not cinematically yanking at your nosehairs in the hopes that youll cry. ""War Horse"" is so plodding and shameless that I worried that screenwriters Lee Hall (""Billy Elliot"") and Richard Curtis (""Notting Hill"" ""Love Actually"") either forgot everything they know about their craft or were paid handsomely enough to hold their noses and start shoveling. (In an ideal world the two will collaborate on a blistering satire of this hokum.) Based on Michael Morpurgos novel which also spawned the Tony-winning play the film follows the saga of Joey a racehorse thats trained for farm work under the loving tutelage of Albert (Jeremy Irvine) after Alberts drunken father Ted (Peter Mullan) overpays for the animal at auction. World War I comes along and separates Joey and Albert although the two of them have more than their fair share of adventures on their own -- Joey is captured by Germans forced to lug around heavy artillery briefly hidden by a French dairy farmer (Niels Arestrup of ""A Prophet"") and tangled in barbed wire while Albert faces the grim realities of life on the battlefield. Theres certainly a story to be told in all this but rather than trust its inherent drama or the work of his fine cast Spielberg pours on the stirring music the orange sunsets and the wide-eyed wonder while cranking all the emotional stakes up to 11. None of this covers up the fact that weve seen this stuff done better elsewhere -- the scenes of Albert winning Joeys trust pale next to the gorgeous wordless sequences in ""The Black Stallion"" where boy and horse bond and while the battle scenes here are stirring from time to time theyre barely a patch on ""Paths of Glory"" or even Spielbergs own accomplishments in ""Saving Private Ryan."" By the time the film reaches its final 30 minutes during which I counted four separate ""Cry now"" moments and Kaminski slaps on the orange-marmalade filter to flagrantly rip off ""Gone with the Wind"" I was quite ready for this impressive horse and the scores of people who fall in love with him over the course of the story to go off and live on a farm somewhere. Despite its pedigree ""War Horse"" more often than not feels like an ""American Idol"" contestant with impressive pipes but no idea what to do with them -- belting to the back row is only effective when you do it occasionally not when you start on that note and then stay there for hours at a time.

Starring Jeremy Irvine Emily Watson Niels Arestrup and Peter Mullan. Directed by Steven Spielberg. (PG-13. 147 minutes. Opens Sunday at Bay Area theaters.) There are extraordinary and beautiful things in ""War Horse"" enough of them to make the movie a pleasure and a worthwhile experience though not enough to trick the eye or get you believing this movie hangs together. As messy as it is inspired it jumps from episode to episode lurching unexpectedly to life - more entertaining than it seemingly should be and all the while making you feel things whether you want to or not. Yes this is a Steven Spielberg picture. He directed it and like Blondie in the old song hes gonna getcha getcha getcha one way or another. If you have a grudge against Spielberg you will find everything about him that you dont like in ""War Horse"" such as sentimentality and grandly obvious effects like ""Gone With the Wind"" sky lighting and blatantly heroic compositions. But pay attention also to how quickly Spielberg establishes character and to the truth he gets from his actors. Notice also the dazzling brilliance of his action sequences and how alive his camera is to the subtleties of human feeling. Related Stories Review War Horse Adapted from play ""War Horse"" is adapted from a London stage play in which the full-grown horses were operated by several clearly visible puppeteers. It seemed easy - like an obvious opportunity to make it all better bigger and more real - to transfer that vision to celluloid. But transplants are dangerous. The delicate meshing of elements that made the stage play effective such as aspects of tone and emphasis and degrees of harshness and unreality becomes unsettled in the movie. Something magical is lost and the relentless specifics of the battle scenes often undercut the plays sad fairy tale quality. By far the most unexpected loss from stage to screen is narrative cohesion. In essence the movie is about everything that happens to a horse named Joey who starts out on a farm and then is sold into service during World War I. Like the play the movie is episodic lingering here and there to explore the lives of the various people whom Joey meets. But in the play Joey was always onstage if only in the background so it always felt like his story. In a film we cant always see the horse and so the story feels more start-and-stop. There was no way around this. Its just something that can happen when you adapt something from one medium into another then look up and realize ""Uh-oh."" Too smart not to have seen the problem early in the process Spielberg concentrates on what he can fix doing everything he can to make each episode rich fraught and full. Life on the farm is a soft-focus nightmare in which a stupid drunken farmer (Peter Mullan) turns a racehorse into a plow horse and the teenage son Albert (Jeremy Irvine) strives to protect the horse from abuse. Later we get the vivid horror of the old warfare meeting the new when the horse takes part in a gallant cavalry charge ... right into machine-gun fire. A particular highlight is the brief idyll in which Joey comes into the possession of a French farm girl (Celine Buckens) and her grandfather (Niels Arestrup). Entire movies have been crafted of less emotional material the beautiful countryside the threatening war and the sound of guns the sickly girl with a big spirit the old man determined to protect her at all costs. This is entirely lovely and yet probably constitutes 15 minutes of screen time at most. Spielberg just tosses this off. Strange mix ""War Horse"" is a strange concoction a mix of Robert Bressons ""Au Hasard Balthazar"" and the first 20 minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan"" and yet every so often the poetic and the terrible meet in ideal symbiosis. The horses terrified night charge across the battlefield over the front lines and through the trenches in itself justifies the movie. It constitutes one of Spielbergs finest sequences difficult to bring off and perfectly realized in its grandeur realism and pain. A subsequent interlude in which enemy soldiers meet in the no-mans-land has humor suspense and uplift. Its like watching this filmmakers philosophy embodied in a single sequence. ""War Horse"" is not Spielbergs best movie nor is it even close. But its no small thing that it contains some of his best stuff. E-mail Mick LaSalle at mlasallesfchronicle.com.

Its a long slog at almost 21/2 hours and occasionally it resorts to obvious sentimentality. At times its hard to escape the sense that were watching Saving Private Ryan-meets-The Black Stallion. The films dialogue is sometimes cliched but thats mostly beside the point. Indeed for the first 15 minutes few words are even uttered. War Horse has an exhilarating impressionistic beauty and emotion trumps rationality at every turn.In the hands of a master director like Steven Spielberg the story is impeccably crafted and heartfelt if consistently predictable. The collaboration of Spielberg and cinematographer Janusz Kaminski results in gorgeous visuals.VIDEO Spielberg brings the Tony Award-winning play to the big screenVIDEO War Horse star Watson discusses fear of horsesBased more on the childrens book by Michael Morpurgo than the hit stage play (in which clever puppetry is a key allure) the story unfolds at the onset of World War I in exceptionally verdant British countryside. The handsome horse repeatedly referred to as ""remarkable"" justifiably gets top billing above Albert (Jeremy Irvine) the lad who is devoted to him. Alberts father Ted (Peter Mullan) is a drunken neer-do-well who buys the Thoroughbred horse at auction much to the ire of his long-suffering wife Rose (Emily Watson). Their farm is already perched on rocky land and what they need is a strong plow horse not an elite stallion.About the movieWar Horse out of fourStars Jeremy Irvine Peter Mullan Emily Watson David Thewlis Niels Arestrup Tom Hiddleston DirectorSteven SpielbergDistributor Walt Disney Pictures Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of war violence Running time 2 hours 26 minutes Opens Sunday nationwideAlbert falls instantly in love with the horse whom he names Joey and to placate his mother he pledges to tame the spirited beast. He succeeds only to have his father sell Joey to British cavalry officer Capt. Nicholls (Tom Hiddleston). The officer promises Albert hell look after his beloved horse and off Joey goes into battle. Shortly thereafter Albert enlists. We know Joey and Albert will meet again somewhere. Anyone who suspects otherwise has never seen a Spielberg film.Much of the film is devoted to gritty battlefield scenes that after some time grow numbing. But one of the more stirring sequences has Joey along with the British cavalry racing bravely forward only to meet up with strafing German bullets.The holidays present a rare double dose of Spielbergs special brand of storytelling. While both War Horse and The Adventures of Tintin are rousing family-friendly adventure sagas War Horse is the more powerful and resonant tale.

""War Horse is the best film of the year. The year unfortunately is 1942.Steven Spielbergs ""serious movie of the season - the director has doubled down again with ""The Adventures of Tintin representing his more commercial impulses - is a work of full-throated Hollywood classicism that looks back to the craftsmanship and sentimentality of John Ford and other legends of the studio era. Theres a lot of this going around at the moment. ""The Artist and Martin Scorseses ""Hugo each bow low to the movies of yesteryear searching for solace in a hot-wired culture where we can hardly hear ourselves think.Always the most audience-conscious of his generations geniuses Spielberg takes a different approach. Drawn from Michael Morpurgos 1982 young adult novel about a boy his steed and the Great War that tears them from each other (with additional elements taken from the 2007 stage adaptation currently running on Broadway) ""War Horse is a sweeping epic about the politics that separate people and the animals that bring them together. The film is self-consciously old-school to the point where you can feel Spielberg treating us like children just as the old studio heads used to.The boy in this love story Albert Narracott of Devonshire is played by a newcomer named Jeremy Irvine who looks freshly hatched and astounded to be here. The son of a tenant farmer Albert falls for Joey before the foal has barely stood up and his crush deepens when the old man (Peter Mullan) buys the horse at auction for far more than he can afford. ""There are big days and there are small days the father growls and if Spielberg has ever made a movie about a small day its safely in a can in his basement.The first act of ""War Horse is its most nakedly nostalgic with camera shots evoking the long glowing corridors and side-lit doorways of Fords ""How Green Was My Valley and ""The Quiet Man. Silhouettes at sunset Alberts sainted mother (Emily Watson) a girl passing through with the red Technicolor hair of Maureen OHara - this is the work of an obsessive movie-lover recombining the pieces of his passions. Yet the story line hardly carries the same urgency. A nasty landlord (David Thewlis) threatens to take the horse away and evict the family from their land unless Albert can teach his thoroughbred to plow a rocky field; the sequence is beautifully filmed and so true to the cliches of inspirational moviemaking that you can predict individual shots.The visuals and the narrative get a lift when Joey goes off to World War I sold by Alberts father to an upper-class captain (Tom Hiddleston) who promises to care for him. (""I will find you the boy cries out to his horse briefly channeling Daniel Day-Lewis in ""The Last of the Mohicans.) This leads to a harrowing battle sequence that explains with startling visual poetry why 19th-century notions of gentlemanly warfare were useless in the face of 20th-century machine guns. Spielberg has taken pains to say that ""War Horse is not a war movie and in a sense hes right The climactic Battle of the Somme a trench-war variation on the D-Day of ""Saving Private Ryan is a case of a great director repeating himself. Its the survivors two-legged and four who matter here. Joey is passed from owner to owner each of whom is a different story of battlefront suffering. Some of these plotlines register more than others. A little girl (Celine Buckens) and her crusty grandpa (Niels Arestrup) could come out of a Disney TV film from the early 1960s but the two young German brothers (Leonard Carow and David Kross) who run away with Joey from their unit are bluntly moving portraits of youth wasted.Spielbergs hardest challenge obviously is getting us to care about the horse. The movies have always come up against this wall - the fact that these noble beautiful animals dont seem to register many emotions beyond what we project onto them. ""National Velvet was more about Velvet than Pie; ""Seabiscuit was about the three humans closest to the title steed; and so on. Spielberg has Joey (played by a number of horses but mostly one named Finder) ""volunteering for missions by putting his neck into collars or racing to the front lines to replace a faltering fellow warhorse and unless youre very young or addled by equines these moments will feel cloying and false. (Theres even a horse deathbed scene that would make Louis B. Mayer himself weep with shame.)The movie works as it means to when it just lets Joey be Joey. Its worth sitting through all of ""War Horse for the sequence in which the exhausted animal crucified by barbed wire in the middle of no mans land becomes the object of concern - and then the cause of a temporary peace - between the warring British and Germans. The image of the horse shrouded in mist in a desolate landscape silent amid a tangle of metal is a vision worthy of Herzog but its also pure Spielberg iconic elemental cinematic.Then were back to High Hollywood corn expertly roasted including a sunset homecoming downloaded directly from ""Gone With the Wind. Spielbergs A-team - cinematographer Janusz Kaminski editor Michael Kahn composer John Williams (sampling Ralph Vaughan Williams at his most lyrical) - lifts it all to the peak of craftsmanship but whats missing is the sense of a born filmmaker personally engaged by the story hes telling.

Slideshow Bloody sugary tear-jerker of a tale about a horse and his boy Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about War Horse >> In War Horse Steven Spielbergs unashamedly old-fashioned adaptation of the Michael Murpurgo childrens novel - and of the hit play it spawned - the time-tested tale of a horse and his boy is given an epic backdrop the bleak bloody carnage of the First World War. But first young Albert (Jeremy Irvine) has to bond with Joey the brown steed with the white markings that Alberts father Ted (Peter Mullan) won at auction - bidding more than he could afford for a horse ill-equipped to drag a plough across his ""stony patch of unpromising land."" But Ted was determined to outbid his landlord (a Dickensian despot played by David Thewlis) and brings home this fine smart animal to the delight of his son. And to the consternation of the missus. ""What have you done?"" wails a ruddy-cheeked Emily Watson in apron and bun abandoning her knitting and her pots and pans to admonish her boozing no-good spouse. What Ted has done is set the wheels in motion that eventually - after many a galloping-across-the-moors montage - sends Joey off to the battlefields of France sold to a British cavalry officer in order to stave off eviction. ""I solemnly swear we will be together again"" the boy tearfully tells the horse leaning into his long proud muzzle as the officer hangs by to take him away. ""I will find you and I will bring you home."" And if you have any doubt about such a declaration well remember this is Spielberg. And this is the holiday season when miracles are celebrated and when families overdose on candy canes and cake. War Horse is sugary to be sure - but it is sugar cut with cannon fire and barbed wire and the horrors of war. Although there is little of the visceral shock of the filmmakers World War II drama Saving Private Ryan - the piercing crack of machine guns the surreal specificity of violence - that is not to say the scenes of combat and conflict here are not unsettling. War Horse isnt a film for younger children - there are haunting images here eerie tableaux of the wounded and the dead both man and beast. But Spielberg and his team - composer John Williams as always cinematographer Janusz Kaminski screenwriter Richard Curtis - never forget their mission to pull at heart strings jerk some tears. Joey travels into the Somme surviving a deadly cavalry charge. The horse finds temporary refuge at the windmilled farm of an old French jam-maker (Niels Arestrup) and his granddaughter (Celine Buckens). Then the Germans take the horse and hes used to haul weaponry - watching as his stablemate and best bud a black stallion called Topthorn succumbs to the stress and artillery fire. So its Joey not Albert who is the hero of War Horse of course - its the horses journey and the horses job to find his way back to the boy he left behind. A boy who is now huddled in the trenches with the rats and the gas masks wondering if he will ever see his pal Joey again. Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

These early scenes arent just slow; theyre also treacly in the manner of Steven Spielbergs most self-indulgent enterprises. A boy (Jeremy Irvine) falls in love with a horse and guides the ""fancy"" creature against its nature to plow the family fields. Tears are shed. A honking goose keeps popping into the frame as if Spielberg felt the material needed easy comic relief to stay afloat.Then the horse is conscripted into World War I and the movie shifts from mildly touching to transcendent with alarming speed. Galloping from bloody battlefield to loving caretakers to hard labor the brown equine beauty provides a shattering tour of the Great War that works on the most intimate levels and sweeping canvases. Spielberg has said the relationship between boy and beast led him to adapt the successful stage play but War Horse opening Christmas Day will also go down as one of the finest World War I movies ever made.Its not that the director strips away all vestiges of Spielbergian sentimentality; things get particularly mawkish down the home stretch. Even sad Spielberg movies tend to have happy endings. But the accumulation of soaring cinematic moments cant be denied. Janusz Kaminski Spielbergs longtime cinematographer has never been better. He conjures a stunning assortment of golden-brown hues and swoops and darts through the trench warfare that defined the conflict. War Horse is a film of jaw-dropping beauty that John Ford would appreciate.Smaller moments work equally well. Niels Arestrup who was fearsome as the Corsican crime kingpin in A Prophet brings tenderness and gravitas to the role of a French jam maker trying to wait out the war with his granddaughter (Celine Buckens). Theyre among the people connected to one another by the majestic animal whose presence has a way of flattening out foes into a common humanity.War Horse is a rare piece of classical big-boned moviemaking the kind rarely even attempted these days. How bracing to see that even now when viewing options are more splintered and varied than ever epic Old Hollywood can still flex its muscles.A- Starring Jeremy Irvine Peter Mullan Emily Watson Niels Arestrup Tom Hiddleston Celine Buckens and David Thewlis. Directed by Steven Spielberg. PG-13 (intense sequences of war violence). 146 mins.

With Jeremy Irvine Emily Watson. Director Steven Spielberg (226). PG-13 intense war violence. Opens Sunday at area theaters. Steven Spielbergs ""War Horse"" contains a scene so unshakable Ive thought of it every day since I first saw the film In 1914 France a classically-trained British army raises its swords rides forward on horseback and meets the artillery of Germany. A minute later all thats left is row after row of tragically riderless mounts and a newly modern definition of battle. Though based on Michael Morpurgos young-adult novel and presented as a family picture make no mistake This is not a childrens story about a boy and his horse. Its a study of war that happens to be viewed through the eyes of those two characters. The sight of forcibly abandoned steeds may not be as graphic as the combat scenes from ""Saving Private Ryan"" but it is every bit as powerful. Long before we get there however Spielberg leisurely introduces our leads Albert (Jeremy Irvine) and his beloved pet Joey. This is the weakest element of the film a well-shot but overly sentimental tale in which Alberts drunken father (Peter Mullan) and formidable mother (Emily Watson) must rescue their failing Devon farm. Though Joey saves the day he is sold to a British captain leaving a heartbroken Albert bound to rescue him. The perpetually endangered horse does his duty in every imaginable way serving soldiers comforting children and bringing enemies together. By this time Albert has entered the army himself determined to find Joey even as he also struggles to survive. Spielberg chooses to segment his unabashedly old-fashioned film into a series of meticulously-composed chapters connected by John Williams overemphatic score. Perhaps inevitably the parts feel somewhat stronger than the whole. (This is also the case with Spielbergs just-released ""The Adventures of Tintin."") While the Tony-winning play based on the same book creates unexpected impact through strikingly inventive puppetry Spielberg is at a disadvantage in employing such a literal approach. Not even animals as beautiful as these can substitute for human ingenuity and imagination. Even so there is much to be admired here from exquisite visual compositions -- expect Oscar attention for cinematographer Janusz Kaminski -- to heartfelt performances (Niels Arestrup is a standout as a devoted grandfather). And when were most deeply moved the vision we connect with isnt that of a horse or his owner but a storyteller so fascinated by the best and worst of humanity he continues to search for a way to reconcile them. Magic Moment Youll never forget those horses going into a forest carrying soldiers and coming out alone.

By Peter Rainer Film critic December 22 2011 Save for later Saved In this film image released by Disney Jeremy Irvine is shown in a scene from ""War Horse."" The film was nominated Dec. 15 for a Golden Globe award for best motion picture drama. Andrew Cooper/Disney/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of ""War Horse"" is a movie that perhaps only Steven Spielberg could have made. This is both good and not so good. On the plus side the film has many of his trademark virtues - a resonant feeling for loneliness and emotional connection stirring action sequences vaunted storytelling. The not so good stuff the dewy sentimentality and picture-book imagery especially is generic Spielberg. The generic ultimately wins out.Originally a bestselling 1987 novel by Michael Morpurgo ""War Horse"" was dramatized for the London stage by Nick Stafford in 2007 and later won a Tony on Broadway. In all of its incarnations the heart of this material - a boys love for his horse - is almost as old as the movies. Set in England just before the outbreak of World War I the narrative centers on Albert Narracott (Jeremy Irvine) a teenager living with his family in the English countryside who bonds with the beautiful bay thoroughbred he names Joey. When Alberts alcoholic father (Peter Mullan) in order to avoid eviction sells Joey to the British cavalry Albert is heartbroken and vows one day to reunite with him even though horses in World War I often ended up as cannon fodder. From this point on Spielberg and his screenwriters (Lee Hall and Richard Curtis) serve up a series of extended vignettes chronicling Joeys travails as he is adopted by a kindly English officer (Tom Hiddleston) a pair of German brothers (Leonhard Carow and David Kross) an old Frenchman (Niels Arestrup) and his teenage granddaughter (Celine Buckens) before the film finally circles back to Albert now a British soldier in the Somme offensive. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? The novel imagined the story from Joeys point of view and the stage play utilized large-scale puppetry to represent the horses. By contrast Spielbergs movie is unavoidably more realistic. In the end no matter how photogenic Joey is he is still irrevocably a horse. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? This is not all for the worse. The heavy-going mystic-symbolic trappings of Joey in his earlier incarnations are played down here in favor of the sheer gorgeousness of the steed. This is in keeping with the movies rich history of glorifying horses as horses (""National Velvet"" ""The Black Stallion"" etc.). But inevitably because Spielberg is Spielberg Joey does indeed become more than just a horse even if we dont enter into his thoughts. Joey is the spiritual connection between warring factions who at bottom are just decent human beings caught up in a senseless war. The centerpiece sequence has an American and a German soldier venturing into no mans land to disentangle Joey from a welter of barbed wire. Its a powerful scene and yet in his not too subtle way Spielberg is manipulating us as much as those puppeteers on Broadway manipulated Joey.In general Spielberg milks each scene for maximum memorability which becomes wearing after awhile. The grandfather and his granddaughter are pastoralized creations every bit as much as Albert and Joey. The rural landscapes - those that arent littered with corpses - are shimmering nostalgic tableaux that evoke the films of David Lean and even in a particularly overscaled moment at the end ""Gone With the Wind.""Spielberg has never been the director you go to for subtlety and at his transcendent best in films like ""E.T."" subtlety is the last thing you wanted from him. Hes a big-gesture direct-emotion kind of guy. Some of ""War Horse"" is intensely affecting - especially the early scenes between Albert and his long-suffering mother (Emily Watson) and the massacre in the wheat fields of the overmatched British by the Germans which ranks almost as high as the D-Day invasion sequence in ""Saving Private Ryan.""But too much of this film is felt on a cinematic level instead of an emotional one. Spielberg by now can do this sort of thing with such facility that he often lets his technical skills override his deepest engagement in the material. I guess what Im saying is that ""War Horse"" despite its excellences is a supreme demonstration of a director phoning it in. Grade B (Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of war violence.)

War Horse Good Director Steven Spielberg. Cast Jeremy Irvine Emily Watson David Thewlis. Rating PG-13 for intense war violence. This weeks new movie releases {snl } Films with animal stars Its a beautiful movie stunning to look at with echoes of film history all throughout reaching back to ""Gone With the Wind"" ""The Searchers"" Spielbergs own ""Saving Private Ryan"" and more. Its also unapologetically sentimental. Spielberg all but begs you to cry and unless youre a heartless cad you probably will. Interview Steven Spielberg Review The Adventures of Tintin Its both sides of the filmmaker in other words and your feelings about the film ultimately will depend on your feelings about Spielberg. Theres no question that its incredibly well-made breathtaking in its visual scope and texture gritty in its depiction of World War I battles and borderline lachrymose in its emotional manipulation. The good outweighs the bad -- its not even close. Its very much an old-time moviegoing experience; the film could have been made in 1940 and thats a compliment. It begins in rural England on the eve of World War I. Ted Narracott (Peter Mullen) a drunken farmer spitefully outbids his landlord (David Thewlis) for a horse spending money he cant afford to lose. His wife Rosie (Emily Watson) is furious but his teenage son Albert (Jeremy Irvine) loves the animal which he names Joey and boy and horse quickly bond. Nearly the entire first half of the movie is devoted to Albert and Joey establishing the horse as a hard worker and loyal friend. Hes not a plow horse for instance but Joey does that job well enough for Ted to do some planting. Then war. Strapped for money as usual Ted sells Joey to the British army. Albert is too young to enlist but the kindly Capt. Nicholls (Tom Hiddleston) assures him that he will take good care of the horse. Nicholls and the horse ship out to France where Nicholls rides Joey into battle which quickly goes from inspiring to horrific -- and is just a taste of things to come. Joey winds up on a French farm under the care of an old man (Niels Arestrup) and his sickly granddaughter (Celine Buckens) but German soldiers arrive and take the horse enlisting him with other horses to drag weaponry up hills; the horses are treated as a disposable means of transportation used as long as theyre useful and shot as soon as they arent. By this time Albert has grown old enough to enlist and he is among the British forces fighting the Battle of the Somme. Unbeknownst to Albert Joey becomes trapped in No Mans Land the area between the trenches. A kind of mini cease-fire is declared as a German and British soldier work to free the horse. The scene is heavy-handed but effective. The tranquil moment cannot last as the British go on the offensive. This is trench warfare -- brutal primitive and costly. When the order to charge is given those trying to retreat will be shot by their own men. These scenes are intense -- not the limb-shearing action Spielberg re-created in ""Private Ryan"" but close. Although ""War Horse"" is very much a family movie some of the action and its aftermath is hard to watch no matter your age. The ending like the rest of the movie is shot gorgeously by Spielbergs cinematographer Janusz Kaminski with the fiery sky recalling ""Gone With the Wind"" and the framing of the final shot reminiscent of ""The Searchers."" The film is based on the book by Michael Morpugo and has been successfully staged as a play. Spielbergs telling is epic. His instincts toward the maudlin are on display at times but the horror of war balances those tendencies making ""War Horse"" a throwback capable of speaking to modern audiences.

Comments (2) click to enlarge War Horse Rated PG-13  146 minutes  2011 Steven Spielberg draws on his three most important influences--John Ford David Lean and Walt Disney--for this epic pet movie set during World War I. The film begins in an idealized rural England (modeled after the timeless Ireland of Fords How Green Was My Valley) as a farmers son (Jeremy Irvine) bonds with the ""magical"" horse hes training to plow the land. When the army buys the horse and takes it to the French front Spielberg goes into Lean mode finding in war the greatest landscapes and crowd shots that money can buy.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The title of War Horse appears onscreen twice during the film once at the end and once near the beginning where it follows the image of a newborn colt that looks too beautiful ever to be involved in a war. The horse later named Joey grows bigger but even as he heads into the thick of battle he never looks at home in his surroundings. Humans make wars. Animals get drawn into them. And in Steven Spielbergs adaptation of Michael Morpugos 1982 childrens novel (and of the popular play it inspired) the horses essential innocence offsets the horrors of war around him. Joey was born for something better than this. Maybe we all were. War Horse opens in Devon England shortly before the outbreak of World War I a conflict that will cleave off a chunk of a generation of young men and leave those that survived scarred by the experience. Newcomer Jeremy Irvine plays one of the war-bound even if he doesnt know it at the time. Seen first as a teen entranced by the young horse hes delighted when his father (Peter Mullan) purchases Joey at auction even though they need a workhorse not a thoroughbred to work their difficult land and avoid eviction at the hands of their cruel landlord (David Thewlis). Irvines mother (Emily Watson) though used to living with a man more comfortable drinking than talking questions the decision as well and in time the family is compelled to sell Joey into military service as the mount of a handsome young captain (Tom Hiddleston) who promises to take care of the animal and return him at the end of the war. He finds he can only keep the first of those promises. From there the film follows Joeys episodic tour of World War I. As he passes from owner to owner and from one side of the conflict to the other--shades of Robert Bressons Au Hasard Balthazar--the horse observes one inhumane spectacle after another often ending up on the receiving end of wars cruelty. He may not understand whats going on around him but his eyes--and the horses used to portray Joey are remarkably expressive--convey an instinctual sense that life has been thrown out of balance. Kindness becomes a liability for the characters of War Horse and like Joey they sense something has gone wrong and feel powerless to change it. The film offers one example after another of how war not only erodes our best instincts but also punishes them. To create his disarmingly earnest film Spielberg draws from the past. Its tone is humanistic and its technique classic. For the Devon sequences Spielberg borrows from the language of John Ford depicting home as a place of shelter that needs constant protection one populated with characters for whom love is bound to fractiousness. Once in Europe his technique opens up and the film around Joey shifts in tone as his path takes him from the front lines to the quiet places in danger of falling before the war machines. Spielberg exercises stunning control behind the camera never more than in a late-film sequence that all but erases the distance between the viewers perspective and Joeys. His exactitude always serves the films emotional directness however as do the openhearted performances of the actors (both human and otherwise). All play characters swept up in global currents they cant control forced to partake in bloodshed they never desired and struggling to hold onto the things--whether beast or idea--that reminds them of who they were.

Its simply crafted at times bordering on simplistic and it doesnt just wear its heart on its sleeve -- it wears its heart on its heart and the earnestness is admittedly a lot to take at times. However if War Horse were to have been released 40 50 or 60 years earlier wed likely be hailing it as a masterpiece today rather than admiring it as an impeccable anachronism of family filmmaking bygone. As such director Steven Spielberg spends as much time breaking the audience in as Albert Narracott (Jeremy Irvine) does with his new steed Joey. Hes a stallion for a family in need of a workhorse the latest in a series of poor decisions by Alberts drunkard of a father Ted (Peter Mullan) but sure enough Albert manages to make a plow horse out of Joey yet. Alas that noble effort fails to prevent the family farm from falling on hard times once more and as England heads into World War I Ted sells Joey off to the army. Captain Nicholls (Tom Hiddleston) swears to the distraught teen that hell do his best to see that the horse returns to his rightful home but it soon becomes apparent that the captain is merely the first of many new owners that Joey will encounter amid relentless human conflict. Made up of equal parts The Black Stallion and All Quiet on the Western Front with hints of Gallipoli and Gone with the Wind thrown in for good measure Spielbergs translation of Michael Morpurgos 1982 novel (already adapted rather recently into a wildly acclaimed stage play) is as devoid of cynicism as it is subtlety. Everyone who encounters Joey -- an older Frenchman (Niels Arestrup) and his granddaughter for example along with both British and German soldiers reluctant to fight -- regards the rather humanized beast with unfailing awe and perhaps the films biggest fault is that most every character that Joey meets along the way is easier to empathize with than that human puppy Albee. War Horse is filled with sturdy supporting performances -- especially by Mullan and Arestrup not to mention Emily Watson as Teds much put-upon wife David Thewlis as the Narracotts undoubtedly greedy landlord and Benedict Cumberbatch as Nicholls very English commanding officer -- but even once in the ranks himself years later Irvines character harbors a devotion nigh worrisome to that damn horse of his. The sentiment clearly exists to be contrasted against the harrowing experience of battle which Spielberg conveys with ease even for a PG-13 picture but the screenplay (by Lee Hall and Richard Curtis) becomes something of a revolving door for compelling protagonists. Thankfully each new chapter of Joeys journey brings with it a renewed sense of what capable hands the material has fallen into. Janusz Kaminski shoots much of the earlier more pastoral sequences with a golden hue more classical than cloying while the wartime passages are unsurprisingly defined by dingy browns and grays as the trenches of turmoil and No Mans Land echo a plowed-then-flooded field prominently featured in the first act. When Nicholls and his men charge out of a field of wheat and into an unsuspecting German camp it reeks of David Leans influence on Spielberg; touches of John Ford also abound especially in the films silhouette-heavy final moments. As one might expect Michael Kahns editing is as quietly sure-handed as ever while John Williams score is suitably grand if a bit too forceful on occasion. The technical proficiency comes as no surprise but the often understated manner with which the director reveals fates grim designs keeps the melodrama on an even emotional keel. More often than not War Horse serves as both a compelling evocation of an era in transition -- when swords gave way to cannons and guns when horses gave way to tanks and trucks when turn-of-the-century industry threatened to co-opt timeless innocence -- and a familiar yet effective anti-war screed along the lines of Spielbergs own Empire of the Sun. However in the wake of great conflict and even greater contrivance the ending doesnt feel like a pulled punch so much as a missed opportunity to elevate this film from an old-fashioned adventure to a tale every bit as staggering as it is sweeping.

Steven Spielberg at the top of his powers as one of the most successful and creative film directors of the past century is the best reason I can think of to get off your duff and head for the cinema on Christmas Day. You will not believe the epic splendor sweeping drama and heart-stopping passion he brings to War Horse. Its a rare and genuine movie masterpiece that deserves the label in a thousand ways. Turning a beloved play into a movie is a job for either a fool or a daredevil. Mr. Spielberg is neither but he is a visionary with unflinching faith in his own instincts. He must have known going in that he couldnt satisfy the myriad fans of the London and Broadway hit about the cruel things the British did to their horses in World War I. On the stage the familiar theme of a boys unshakable love for his horse was innovative in its use of life-size puppets with real feelings and expressions that moved like Tinker Toys. The film uses actual horses to tell the story of a colt named Joey sold to the cavalry to lug the cannons of war through the German trenches and a farmboy named Albert Narracott who enlisted to travel halfway across Europe to rescue him from the front lines. On screen Albert is played by impossibly handsome newcomer Jeremy Irvine whose career is already reaching rocket force (he follows War Horse as Pip in the new production of Dickenss Great Expectations). Instead of puppets Joey is played by 15 different horses but the one featured most prominently is American equine Finder who starred in Seabiscuit. Finder is a four-legged superstar who can do everything but talk even though he has a way of communicating with Albert that is awesome. What he goes through in War Horse is so rending that never before has the disclaimer ""No animals were harmed in the filming of this motion picture"" carried so much badly needed reassurance. Finder deserves an Oscar for--well for being the best and most beautiful horse on the screen. Based on the 1982 childrens novel by Michael Morpurgo War Horse is an elegiac film that clocks in at two hours and 20 minutes but I treasured every single second. Mr. Spielberg brings so much decency and integrity to the familiar theme of a boy in love with a horse that I didnt miss the puppets at all. The humor and spirit that had such a profound impact on audiences young and old are not only preserved but enhanced by the personalities of real animals. The careful result is a personalized experience that inspires the same kind of love audiences used to have for Lassie. The vast and sprawling screenplay by Lee Hall and Richard Curtis respects the story enough to leave it unchanged without embellishment. A hardscrabble sharecropper named Ted Narracott goes to auction to buy a plow horse but instead he arrogantly outbids his greedy mean-spirited landlord (David Thewlis) for a magnificent animal of no real value to a crop planter bringing down the wrath of his pragmatic long-suffering wife Rose (Emily Watson). Their besotted son Albie names the horse Joey and vows to teach him how to pull his weight and till the soil. Joey is stubborn and willful with a mind of his own and when the crops fail the only way to pay the rent is to sell Joey to the military. The next hour is told from the horses point of view as the camera follows him through the French battlefields in 1914 where he is cared for by a kind British officer to enemy lines where he bonds with a headstrong black stallion a German deserter and a Dutch girl who protects him by hiding him in a windmill. Captured by the enemy Joey finally ends up in the Somme where Albie sees combat at last. In one particularly sensational sequence Joey is trapped in barbed wife and rescued by two soldiers one German and one British who momentarily put aside their differences through a mutual compassion for an injured animal use wire cutters to save the horses life and take a minute to share memories of their homes on opposite sides of the conflict. If you are not moved to tears by that scene or by Albies eventual reunion with his horse then you need to see a doctor. The logistics are overwhelming. According to the Imperial War Museum more than four million horses perished in the so-called Great War and Mr. Spielberg puts you right into the middle of their pain and terror in sequences using as many as 5800 extras and 280 horses without computer-generated images. What an accomplishment. Like the play the emotional high point of the film is when Albie finally finds Joey. By this time youre so weary from the gas masks the grenades the rats and the cannon fire that you can hardly summon the strength for tears but when Albie blinded by mortar and Joey lame and half-dead reach the green pastures and rose gardens of Devon the tears are evident without coaxing.  Will Rogers always said ""Horses are smarter than humans. You never heard of a horse going broke betting on people."" True but when Albie and Joey reunite two wounded soldiers of war going home together you feel the values horses and humans can share through love loyalty persistence and understanding. It left me emotionally wrecked. War Horse is a dont-miss Spielberg classic that reaches true perfection. Its as good as movies can get and one of the greatest triumphs of this or any other year. For maximum enjoyment I recommend both a box of tissues and a box of popcorn. rreedobserver.com WAR HORSE Running Time 146 minutes Written by Lee Hall and Richard Curtis Directed by Steven Spielberg Starring Jeremy Irvine Emily Watson and David Thewlis 4/4 Comment Filed under David Thewlis Emily Watson Horse Jeremy Irvine movie Movie Review Steven Spielberg theater 2 World War I Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Pussy Riot On Their Provocative Donald Trump-Inspired Art Installation Culture The (Real) Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia Origin Story Culture Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://www.observer.com/2011/12/this-war-horse-is-not-just-a-war-horse/,200,warhorse31,warhorse,observer

Hoberman Spielberg and Fincher Taming Creatures Wednesday December 21 2011 at 4 a.m. By J. Hoberman 1 A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Consummate technicians with bankable interests and personal trademarks Steven Spielberg and David Fincher are something more than auteurs but also something less--closer to skilled craftsmen than creative artists.Spielbergs War Horse and Finchers Girl With the Dragon Tattoo prestige adaptations both are quintessential additions to their directors respective bestiaries. The tattooed Girl might make for a more compelling protagonist than the martyred Horse (and its devoted Boy) but both of these doggedly overwrought productions seem less felt than facile essentially uninvolving--except perhaps as logistical exercises.It might be perverse to accuse a tearjerker as accomplished as Steven Spielberg of being unfeeling. But the overcalculation with which he mechanically trots out one of his most familiar tropes for what amounts to a generic Disney animal story seems to preclude any but the most hackneyed emotion. What catastrophe cannot be Spielbergized? No less than Schindlers List Saving Private Ryan and (more entertainingly) War of the Worlds War Horse finds the silver lining of individual salvation in one of modern historys darkest thunderclouds--namely the wholesale pointless slaughter of World War I. Millions die but . . . you dont need me to tell you how this massive capital investment ends.Opening on Christmas Day War Horse is hardly without ambition. As the English country lad Albert (Jeremy Irvine) bonds with the beloved half-Thoroughbred steed he has named Joey and once the horse is conscripted by the British army follows him into the hellish vortex of Flanders Field Spielberg seeks to represent the horror of modern combat in human (or at least mammalian) terms. But since hes a director largely incapable of understatement War Horse is served up with a self-aggrandizing distracting surplus of Norman Rockwell backlighting aerial landscape shots designed to out-swoop David Leans and an aggravated sense of doggone wonderment amplified by the directors dependence on John Williamss bombastic score. Dialogue is superfluous; in its way War Horse is as much a ""silent movie"" as The Artist. Every triumph is pounded into your head and punctuated by a dolly-in close-up.""Who is this movie for?"" a colleague muttered shortly before bailing. War Horse is based on Michael Morpurgos 1982 young-adult novel itself the basis for the National Theatre of Great Britains virtuoso multiple-Tony-winning fearfully expensive puppet show. I found the play brilliantly staged and dramatically inert and as written by Lee Hall (Billy Elliot) and Richard Curtis (Bridget Joness Diary) the cinematic War Horse is even more simpleminded and inspirational than the stage production eliminating or smoothing over its major conflicts--as when improving the character of Alberts feckless father (Peter Mullan) no longer a coward but an unappreciated war hero who purchases Joey in a fit of drunken bravado directed not against his more successful brother but a greedy landlord. (The play War Horse derives its power from its abstract ""life-like"" puppets. Here the horse isnt anthropomorphized so much as the humans are notably the hyper-animated French grandpa played by Niels Arestrup as if auditioning to understudy one of Snow Whites adorable lil curmudgeons.)Being a movie Spielbergs War Horse is inevitably more graphic than the show--though its battlefield scenes are far less gory than Private Ryans stunning D-Day overture. The run-up to war affords the director some spectacular flourishes even as it broadens Joeys horizons. The horse is purchased by a friendly officer meets and bonds with another stallion Topthorne and leads a surprise cavalry attack on the Germans an exciting rout that like several other moments suggests Spielberg should make a real horse opera. Joey is the first-person narrator of Morpurgos novel. The movie doesnt go that far but it tracks the horse through his own war--several times captured by and escaping from the Germans as he is used to pull field ambulances or haul artillery. Meanwhile Albert is in the trenches still babbling about his lost Joey as he and his comrades go over the top.Following a dumb brute on its arduous journey from master to master (most of whom perish) War Horse has an unavoidable similarity to Robert Bressons sublime Au hasard Balthazar. Indeed the sequence in which Joey--like Bressons donkey--is adopted by a willful unlovable French peasant girl suggests the parallel might have occurred to Spielberg. The difference is not solely a matter of Bressons ascetic restraint and Spielbergs shameless schmaltz or Bressons tragic sense of life and Spielbergs unswerving belief in the happy ending. Suffering witness to all manner of enigmatic human behavior Balthazar is pure existence; Joey is an abstraction. Had Spielberg elected to show war (or life) from Joeys perspective rather than use the horse as the wars protagonist the movie could have been truly terrifying. Instead its most impressive passage is pure digital delirium as an animated Joey runs free across the CGI battlefield jumps over trenches rears up under the full moon pulls down the barbed wire and collapses in no-mans-land.That Joey Uniting doughboys and officers children and adults the Brits and the Bosch mending broken hearts and restoring eyesight to the blind this indomitable horse does not reproach humanity. Embodying what his creators take to be our best most selfless and enduring instincts he justifies it.The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is hardly a personal project. Still David Finchers sveltely malevolent remake of the 2009 Swedish blockbuster directed by Niels Arden Oplev from Stieg Larssons rambling thriller a posthumously published international bestseller and Kindle record-holder is a recognizably Fincherian caper. The movie which opens with a bit of Led Zeppelin grandiosity (covered by Karen O) and a credit sequence of scary satanic rubber- fetish ickiness has a pleasingly dialectical place in the Fincher oeuvre synthesizing aspects of his previous two features the serial-killer procedural Zodiac and the computer-nerd biopic The Social Network.Set in a freeze-your-blood land of streamlined chrome steely dawns and gleaming black-and-silver nocturnes The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo follows a cold trail of ritually butchered women through rural Sweden; these previously unlinked crimes have been discovered as part of an investigation conducted by lefty reporter Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig). This grim do-gooders career was earlier upended by the billionaire corporate crook whom his reporting failed to bring down and he has been hired on the rebound by another Swedish oligarch Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer channeling Max von Sydow) to solve a murder.Beggaring the Kennedy assassination or the crime at the heart of Blow-Up in its wealth of photographic evidence this killing was committed some 45 years ago apparently by one Vanger family member against another. Alternately dashed and dashing Blomkvist is a standard-issue wounded crusader but as millions of earthlings know the movies real protagonist is his ace research assistant Lisbeth Salander. The eponymous asocial goth-punk-pierced-lesbo hacker supreme shes played here by neophyte Rooney Mara best known until now as the Boston University co-ed who called Mark Zuckerberg an asshole five minutes into The Social Network and its her pale flame that illuminates the movie.Steven Zaillians script pushes Larssons narrative originally set at the close of the 20th century toward the present moment. Its a bit late in the day to take seriously the guilty secret of Swedens Nazi sympathizers but amateur torture theater is a perennial movie kick. The novel (originally and pointedly titled Men Who Hate Women by its Trotskyist author) is basically a tale about brutalized females and a fantasy of feminist retaliation. Fincher gets with the program as when Salander handily dispatches a mugger or after being grossly abused by her sadistic legal guardian coolly stages a counter rape of absolute vengeance and then goes out clubbing. (Still as a polished professional and an equal-opportunity entertainer the director--once down in the basement of terror--cant help but dote a bit on the male pathology Larsson abhors framing the ultimate villain as if he like the Zodiac killer were the movies secret star.)The dour spirit of merriment in this clammy universe Maras elfin Salander is not exactly a carbon copy of the spiky-haired menace that Noomi Rapace played in the Oplev movie. Shes funnier as well as more plaintive in her deadpan aplomb. (And once her cockscomb mohawk gives way to a less off-putting coif she seems more playful her outfit taking on the feel of a store-bought Halloween costume.) Nor is Finchers Tattoo a shot-by-shot or even a scene-by-scene recap of Oplevs dowdier production. The remake is an altogether leaner meaner more high-powered stylish and deftly directed affair though similarly hampered by a too-long narrative fuse.Running 158 minutes The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo requires over an hour for Blomkvists story to converge with Salanders and though things do pick up once reporter and hacker begin pursuing parallel research tracks (as well as each other) it grossly overstays its welcome. Where the shudder-inducing Zodiac and even The Social Network resisted closure Dragon Tattoo persists in pursuing three separate endings and by the time they wrap the movie is less a walk on the wild side than an evening stroll through a well-lit topiary garden.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Sorry haters. I dont care how much you think director Steven Spielberg is working you over with this tale of a English farm boy whose beloved horse Joey is sold off for service on the battlefields of World War I. Spielberg doesnt come from that cynical place where hack filmmakers (yes you Michael Bay) squeeze tears solely to squeeze our wallets. In adapting the acclaimed 1982 childrens book by British author Michael Morpurgo Spielberg stays respectful but not beholden to the source. Spielberg must also contend with award-winning New York and London stage productions of War Horse with life-size horse puppets from the brilliant Handspring Puppet Company creating theatrical magic. Spielberg by necessity plays it for real. Reportedly eight horses were used to portray Joey the remarkable red bay with a white cross emblazoned on his forehead and four perfectly matched white socks. But the film is so heartfelt and marvelously crafted by Spielberg cinematographer Janusz Kaminski editor Michael Kahn and screenwriters Lee Hall and Richard Curtis that odious comparisons are swept away. More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> War Horse dawdles a bit at first establishing life on the Dartmoor farm where the teenage Albert (Jeremy Irvine) lives with his drunken father (Peter Mullan) and tough-minded mother (Emily Watson). The pace picks up to the surging John Williams score as soon as Joey is sold to the cavalry and shipped to France where horses were used to haul supplies pull guns and lead the charge into battle. Of the million horses that were sent abroad from the U.K. only 62000 returned the rest dying in the war or slaughtered for meat. No wonder Albert now enlisted is worried. A British officer (Tom Hiddleston so good you want more of him) befriends Albert and promises to send him news of Joey. The film is really a series of encounters between Joey and those he meets including a French girl (Celine Buckens) and her grandfather (a superb Niels Arestrup) and another horse Triphorn. Spielberg keeps to the standards of the PG-13 rating without skimping on the realities of war. The scene of a frightened Joey charging across a scorched battlefield only to be tangled and bloodied by barbed wire is as harrowing as a subsequent moment involving a German soldier and his British counterpart is healing. War Horse gets to you. Its one from the heart.

War Horse By Richard CorlissWednesday Dec. 07 2011 Andrew Cooper / SMPSP / Dreamworks After six years when he directed just one feature (the commissioned fourth episode of Indiana Jones) Steven Spielberg launches two films within four days; and both reveal the old boy wonder in splendid form. On Dec. 21 comes Spielbergs 3-D motion-capture animated feature The Adventures of Tintin from Herges world-beloved comic books a kind of Raiders of the Lost Art of boys adventures and the niftiest pirate movie ever. Then on Christmas day the perfect holiday gift this traditional live-action adaptation of the Michael Morpurgo novel about an English boy and the horse he loved as the first World War was ravaging Western Europe. War Horse also inspired the every-prize-winning stage production in which Joey and the other equine characters are full-size puppets manipulated by actors inside them. Viewers coming to the movie version might think its no fair using real horses (seven played Joey) but Spielbergs team wrangled eloquent performances from all of them and from the human stars Jeremy Irvine Emily Watson Peter Mullan and Tom Hiddleston. In his most painterly film Spielberg has appropriated the lavish visual palette of John Ford movies The Quiet Man for the rural settings The Horse Soldiers for the war scenes. Boldly emotional nakedly heartfelt War Horse will leave only the stoniest hearts untouched.

In War Horse the 2007 London theater sensation adapted by Nick Stafford and now on stage in New York Joey is a giant puppet built of wood and metal manipulated in an amazing semblance of lifelike movement. Now comes War Horse the movie directed by Steven Spielberg from a screenplay by Lee Hall and Richard Curtis. For the first time Joey is a real horse. He doesnt narrate books. He is in the way of real horses awesome to behold. And Spielberg attuned to the power of that equine eloquence gives Joey and his human costars exactly what they need to run free. This is a beautifully built classically framed movie shot with the unshowy natural expressiveness of a John Ford Western by Spielbergs great cinematographer Janusz Kaminski. The tears this War Horse wrings are honest as Joeys fate becomes entwined with those of British and German soldiers equally capable (amidst bombs gun blasts and hideous barbed wire) of appreciating animal magnificence. The universal horror of war provides a grave backdrop for Morpungos very accessible story. A kind farm boy named Albert (well-cast newcomer Jeremy Irvine) raises trains and grows to love Joey then must tearfully hand him over for cavalry duty -- a parting so unbearable for both parties that Albert later enlists and embarks on a mission to find him. Peter Mullan and Emily Watson personify homestead gumption as Alberts tenant-farmer parents and their domestic scenes of gruff tenderness give way to military scenes of heartbreaking bravery and one spectacular sequence of charging cavalry. No wonder the filmmaker was smitten by the source material The project is tailor-made for Saving Private Ryan Spielberg the war-story specialist as well as for E.T. Spielberg the chronicler of boyhood desires and yearnings for family. Under the circumstances simplistic class conflict embodied by David Thewlis as a wealthy sneeringly insensitive landlord feels like one talking point too many. Heres the thing about world wars though They level the playing (and dying) field for the villainous ruling class and virtuous working class alike. In the end all who hate war are united as Steven Spielbergs War Horse unspools to its stirring conclusion. While the book plows ahead on the simplicity of its sentences and the play thunders along on the spectacle of its stagecraft Spielberg expertly harnesses light shadow and landscape in the cause of peace.

Steven Spielberg ambitiously attempts to merge his talents as an entertainer of children and a chronicler of mass devastation in ""War Horse."" Conveying all manner of noble ideas about the savagery of war and the essential decency of mankind through one steeds dramatic WWI journey this beautifully composed picture brings a robust physicality to tried-and-true source material but falls short of the sustained narrative involvement and emotional drive its resolutely old-fashioned storytelling demands. Nonetheless impeccable craft pedigree and unique appeal to heartland and overseas audiences will give DreamWorks year-end prestige release strong theatrical and ancillary legs. Michael Morpurgos popular 1982 novel placed young readers in the mind of Joey a horse raised by an English farmboy sold into war in 1914 and acquired by various foreign hands along a harrowing tour of the Western front. Nick Staffords stage play (which bowed at the West End in 2007 before its Tony-winning Broadway run this year) necessarily dispensed with the equine psychology but invested Joey with considerable soul using exquisite puppetry and theatrical sleight-of-hand to convey that this strong yet fragile animal was indeed an exceptional being. This unique perspective is one of the first casualties of Spielbergs visually expansive approach While it belongs to a tradition of episodic animal-centric movies that includes Robert Bressons donkey classic ""Au hasard Balthazar"" and numerous versions of ""Black Beauty"" the film winds up literalizing a story that derived much of its power from the imaginative leap it required of a live audience. What ""War Horse"" gains in the sweeping pictorial beauty and persuasive realism of Janusz Kaminskis widescreen images it loses in thematic clarity and dramatic focus; neither horses nor humans here merit prolonged engagement as Joey gallops from one set of thinly sketched characters to another. Further diluting the impact of Lee Hall and Richard Curtis adaptation is the sense that with the notable exception of one sequence the material hasnt received the full benefit of Spielbergs expressive powers. A PG-13 example of what might be termed mature family fare the 146-minute picture will prove too long and intermittently intense for small fry but also too repetitive and simplistic to engage adults on more than an earnestly prosaic level. One emerges admiring the films unimpeachable antiwar message and the consummate care and overall restraint with which Spielberg advances it but also sensing that something crucial has been lost in translation. A scenic prologue establishes not only the films central relationship but also its key dramatic methods pure forthright emotions pastoral visuals mythic aspirations insistent music and an exalted view of its titular species. A foal is born in the Devon countryside and its love at first sight for farmers son Albert Narracott (soulful newcomer Jeremy Irvine) who names him Joey. When his hard-drinking father Ted (Peter Mullan) foolishly purchases Joey at auction Albert happily takes on the seemingly impossible task of teaching this bay thoroughbred to plow. Nonetheless with the encouragement of Alberts long-suffering mother (Emily Watson) boy and horse succeed in a sequence that richly conveys the mud sweat and satisfaction of manual labor. More typical of the films initial stretch however is a cloying strain of bucolic whimsy driven by John Williams pushy score and too many comic-relief cutaways to a honking goose. Its therefore more welcome than it should be when the war begins and Albert must bid a sad farewell to Joey who is purchased by kindly Capt. Nicholls (Tom Hiddleston) and though even less suited to battle than to farmwork deployed in a surprise attack on a German encampment in occupied France. Tackling the canvas of WWI for the first time in a career full of WWII pictures Spielberg seizes upon the periods more rudimentary combat style with a typically strong sense of staging. Though free of overt bloodshed the ambush sequence is surprisingly ferocious emphasizing the Brits ruthless onslaught and the Germans helpless surprise in such a way as to drain any thrills from the experience. The gravity is compounded when Kaminskis camera pulls back a la ""Gone With the Wind"" to acknowledge the loss of innumerable cavalrymen their mounts and an entire tradition of battle in the wake of the Germans superior firepower. Its as plain and unequivocating a condemnation of violence as Spielberg has yet delivered and one of the rare scenes in which this ""War Horse"" fully seems to live and breathe onscreen. Unfortunately the rest of the film amounts to a plodding refrain of the same pacifist theme as Joey is briefly commandeered by two brothers in the German army (Leonhard Carow and ""The Readers"" David Kross) before falling into the care of a French farmer (Niels Arestrup ""A Prophet"") and his spirited granddaughter Emilie (Celine Buckens). All these owners regardless of nationality are portrayed as downtrodden fundamentally decent souls caught up in circumstances beyond their control an honorable notion that plays out with a few lump-in-the-throat moments but little in the way of narrative urgency; one doesnt feel carried along by tides of conflict so much as carefully ushered from one safe house to the next. For all the films efforts to dramatize the senseless arbitrary brutality of war its polished surface rarely allows a gut-level sense of peril to materialize so tidy are the storys dramatic ironies and so transparent the manner in which the characters are made to function along the way. It doesnt help that even the French and Germans speak English here a commercial decision that detracts from the films otherwise faultless verisimilitude and seems uniquely jarring for a story in which specific nationalities play so crucial a role. When a German soldier notes ""I speak English well"" you cant help noting hes hardly alone. Despite these hurdles the actors do much to distinguish themselves in their allotted screentime. Mullan Watson and Irvine give warm expressive life to the hard-luck Narracotts while the excellent Hiddleston and Benedict Cumberbatch as the captains surlier comrade ease the films tricky shift into the war zone. Best of all is Arestrups piercingly reserved performance as the aging Frenchman radiating dignity defensiveness and regret but also a gentle hard-won appreciation for lifes essentials. Predicated largely on the inherent grace and dignity of horses their willingness to bear mens burdens and remind them of their better selves the production brings these high-minded sentiments to stirring cinematic life through a massive four-legged ensemble skillfully wrangled by master/trainer Bobby Lovgren. Lensing fully harnesses the surpassing visual glories of the English countryside an endlessly accommodating backdrop for the farming villages and barbed-wire trenches of Rick Carters production design. Sound work is minutely attuned to hoofbeats as well as gunfire and even when momentum flags Michael Kahns editing maintains a sense of flow.

LLC A grandly made tear-jerking film for all audiences the way Hollywood used to make them. TWITTER Steven Spielbergs movie is based on Michael Morpugos 1982 best-seller which was previously adapted for the stage. An elegant elemental borderline corny boy-and-his horse story magnified in significance by its battleground backdrop War Horse possesses a simplicity that is both its greatest strength and an ultimate liability. As the material has already made forceful impact on the public in print and onstage there is little reason to doubt that the same wont hold true for this film version which Steven Spielberg has skillfully wrought as an atmospheric tear-jerking highly cinematic melodrama. But putting this episodic saga on the big screen accentuates its one-dimensionality more than does the still-running legitimate theater version where its symbolic and allegorical elements can be more easily accommodated in abstract terms. All the same this is a story that people of all ages and from all nations can understand which propelled by Spielbergs name and much undoubted acclaim will translate into major rewards at the box office. PHOTOS The Making of Steven Spielbergs War Horse The idea behind Michael Morpugos 1982 best-seller possesses a fundamental universality and innate elegance that is impossible to refute The title character an innocent blameless farm animal is sent off to war and likely death like so many millions of animals and humans down through the millennia cannon fodder for a conflict that wasnt necessary in the first place. As became clear even as it was being fought World War I was the final war in which horses figured much at all. Tie this to to rural English setting the intense bond between the horse and the youngster who cares for him and the fact that the horse is a fleet runner and you have something not far from National Velvet on the Western Front. From a different realm of the cinematic world emanates the echo of Robert Bressons sublime 1966 Au Hasard Balthazar in which the central figure of a donkey silently endures the abuse doled out by humans and the world at large. So many of Spielbergs interests dovetail here A boy isolated in an adult world who takes to heart a non-human creature; 20th century war and storylines that force humanity to take stock and encourage rising above differences to come together. Some specific stylistic enticements might have drawn him as well The chance to shoot in the fashion of an early 1950s British film shot by F.A. Young Oswald Morris or Jack Cardiff with bold solid hues redolent of I.B. Technicolor changeable weather and no modern technical gimmicks; the opportunity to stage an amazing battle charge beginning with concealment in wheat fields pushing bloodily through an encampment and concluding in a massacre; the excuse to do some long Paths of Glory-style takes moving through trenches and a barbed-wired-strewn battlefield and repeatedly the occasion to design beautiful sequences around one of the most inherently cinematic phenomena the natural world provides a running horse. VIDEO Steven Spielbergs Longtime Below-the-Line Collaborators Talk About the Legendary Director Making War Horse To those who have seen the stage production of War Horse which debuted in 2007 in London and last year in New York the big question is whether or not real horses can match the dramatic power of the fantastic large-scale puppets that have made the play such a triumph of stagecraft. The answer in a word is no. The magnificently designed and manipulated theatrical equines transport the spectator into a realm beyond the drama articulated in the text; theyre creations far more breathtaking than anything similar (as in The Lion King) most audiences have seen before making the stage piece a singular event. No matter how dynamic and dramatic everything that surrounds it may be a horse onscreen is still just a horse. But whats appealing about the way Spielberg has made War Horse is the extent to which it recalls the way Hollywood used to produce movies for everyone. Whatever its missteps this is a film that kids middle-aged adults and grandparents can all see -- together or separately -- and get something out of in their own ways. There are precious few films that fit this description today and hats off to Spielberg for making one. The adept script by Lee Hall (Billy Elliott) and Richard Curtis (Four Weddings and a Funeral et al.) draws upon both the book and Nick Staffords dramatization. Setting the course for the horses life is a rash bid by drunken farmer Ted Narracott (Peter Mullen) to buy the steed at auction just to show up his landlord Lyons (David Thewlis) no matter that this blows through his rent money. The demon-ridden Ted his long-suffering wife Rosie (Emily Watson) and earnestly handsome teenage son Albert (Jeremy Irvine) live in a spacious cottage so attractively appointed in a spare roughhewn way that it comes perilously close to resembling the sort of idyllic rustic farmhouse that now commands hundreds of pounds per night from upscale travelers. PHOTOS Steven Spielberg on Set The countryside is stunning too (locations included Dartmoor in the south of Devon Berkshire Surrey Bedfordshire and Wiltshire) but rocky and tough to plow which is what the thoroughbred will need to be taught to do if the family has any hope of remaining on the land. Albert eagerly takes charge of the training patiently coercing Joey to do a job the locals refuse to believe hes fit for. The 45-minute first act shows hardship and struggle alleviated by the bracing beauty of landscapes and Alberts inspiring bond with Joey setting a firm foundation for whats to come. A skilled and fortuitous combination of horse training camera operating and direction has caught many privileged moments of equine behavior. Spielberg has long expressed enthusiasm for the look of mid-century British films and in this first section he and his longtime cinematographer Janusz Kaminski have taken pains to reproduce that handsome style even down to the noticeable use of artificial light outdoors. What results are richly satisfying visuals that wonderfully capture the rugged locations but also a possess a faintly studied old school feel entirely in line with the period and story values. STORY The Making of Steven Spielbergs WWI Epic War Horse When war is declared reliable old Ted comes through again traumatizing his son by selling Joey to the army. Still too young to sign up himself Albert vows hell somehow make sure his horse gets back home. Joeys odyssey begins in France. In the brilliantly filmed wheat field sequence what looks like an English rout of unsuspecting Germans in camp turns into slaughter when the Brits are mowed down by machine guns from the edge of an adjacent forest. Thus does Joey fall into the hands of a young German who soon thinks as highly of him as Albert does. War then buffets the horse into the care of an old Frenchman (Niels Arestrup) and his teenage granddaughter Emilie (Celine Buckens) whose pristine farmhouse has thus far eluded army ransacking. In Emilie does Joey again find a human ready to love and pamper him but tranquility is fleeting as Joey is hitched to a team of fatigued work horses to pull a mighty German cannon up a steep incline. By the time of the Somme offensive Albert has entered the English army with Joey coincidentally just across No Mans Land with the kaisers men. The horrors of trench warfare have been depicted many times before from The Big Parade and Jaccuse to Gallipoli and A Very Long Engagement most often stressing the same themes very much present here about the absurdity of the conflict and resulting pointlessness of the lives lost. But when Albert and a German youngster recklessly venture out into No Mans Land to try to save Joey who has disentangled himself in barbed wire the essential realism of the cinema begins to show up the symbolic artificiality and essential implausibility of the young mens private detente. Onstage the barbed wire incident is properly appalling emotionally and morally but decidedly abstracted due to the dramatic lighting and virtuoso puppetry; onscreen the reaction is more oh poor horse and why cant warring nations get along just as these two fellows do? What follows next runs even deeper into audience-pleasing wish-fulfillment and sentimentality topped by a grandly phoney ending that will set many tears flowing but feels overweening artificial partly because of the Gone With the Wind-style colored lighting in which its bathed.Along with the universal thematic notes the eager-to-please elements assert themselves increasingly as the film marches forward; neither aspect was necessary to stress. STORY The Complete List of Golden Globe Nominations The cast is exemplary down the line with both names and newcomers delivering expansive emotional and almost entirely sympathetic performances. Neither side in the conflict is ennobled or demonized; like Joey (and a striking black steed whos his companion for a while) the grunts are just pawns in the hands of unseen manipulators of countless fates. Irvine is the very picture of a sturdy well-intentioned ruddy-faced English country lad of a hundred years ago and Mullen and Watson look to have come from the earth they tread. Tom Hiddleston cuts a striking figure as an English officer who understands Joey early on setting an example for the many others who briefly come and go through the horses life as the war grinds on. Unsurprisingly from Spielberg as a production the film is everything one could desire in the design aspects editing and the various sorts of effects needed to make the war look real. Entirely in synch with the aims of the film itself John Williams score pushes too hard never holding back when less might well have been more.
