Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Aug. 20 2010 1043PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Piranha 3D Directed by Alexandre Aja Written by Peter Goldfinger and Josh Stolberg Starring Elizabeth Shue Steven R. McQueen and Jerry OConnell Rating  The oil leak in the Gulf this summer brings an entirely coincidental topicality to new schlock horror movie Piranha 3D. In the fictional version the threat isnt from fossil fuel but the escape of a supposedly extinct fish When an earthquake opens up a chasm in the bottom of a popular resort lake thousands of oversized ravenous piranhas join the hard-partying Spring Break college kids in a wet and wild flesh fest. A brazenly outrageous bit of counter-programming to the summers more polite late August fare the movie could be called Eat Prey Gush. French director Alexandre Aja ( High Tension The Hills Have Eyes) finds the right tongue-in-cheek tone with a self-aware sense of the movies absurdity. Piranha 3D is more funny than disgusting even when screen fills with half-nude swimmers bobbing like human dumplings in a roiling vat of borscht. This isnt just sick its clas-sick The script by Peter Goldfinger and Josh Stolberg ( The Sorority Killings) riffs off the original 1975 summer blockbuster Stephen Spielbergs Jaws and the original Piranha a Roger Corman-produced 1978 mini-Jaws parody. There are even a few actors you might know including Leaving Las Vegas Oscar-winner Elizabeth Shue looking MILF-y (as in Mother Id like to Fish with) in a form-clinging khaki law-enforcement uniform as Sheriff Forester. Along with her deputy (Ving Rhames) shes trying to retain order in the community as hordes of drunken randy college kids on Spring Break descend on the resort town of Lake Victoria Arizona. The single-mom sheriff has a 17-year-old son. Jake ( Vampire Diaries star Steven R. McQueen grandson of the sixties action star of the same name) and a couple of bait-sized little blonde children who Jake is supposed to babysit. Instead Jake decides to go on a yacht trip as a location scout for a sleazeball film director (Jerry OConnell) in a Girls Gone Wild-style video shoot. Jakes joined by his almost girlfriend Kelly (Jessica Szohr) who wants to protect him from the giant-breasted maneater in the films cast including British pin-up Kelly Brooks. Notable cameos include Christopher Lloyd as a wild-eyed ichthyologist (essentially reprising his Doc Brown role from Back to the Future) and in a brief cameo Richard Dreyfuss star of the original Jaws. Adam Scott hiding behind oversized glasses and beard plays the equivalent to Dreyfusss scientist character here offering such insights as ""There are thousands of them and theyre pissed."" The actors except for OConnell play it as a straight thriller though suspense isnt too important here. Neither do the 3D effects feel particularly essential. The piranhas which resemble saw-toothed penises torpedo the camera occasionally but typically the depth effects are used for various body expulsions (barfing into the camera for example) as part of the overall comic gross-out goal. Still director Aja cannot be accused of a complete lack of restraint. Though there are few anatomical parts that escape the teeth of terror I cant recall any moment in the whole swirling red miasma when the 3D piranhas and triple-D breasts meet directly. Some flesh is just too sacred. Report Typo/Error Follow Liam Lacey on Twitter liamlacey Comments AA In the know Life This woman became a middle-age man magnet.

"Piranha 3D | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; piranha-3d ) Piranha 3D (United States 2010) August 30 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Seen in standard (non-IMAX) 3D. A review of Piranha 3D is superfluous - the movie is what it is and does what any good exploitation film should do. Unfortunately thats a lot more than many entries into the crowded genre can claim. 3D aside (more about that later) Piranha 3D delivers the goods - bikinis boobs bodies and blood. Director Alexandre Aja successfully navigates the choppy waters of shifting cinematic tone; he may frequently have his tongue planted in his cheek but that doesnt prevent him from generating intense moments in which the character identification is strong enough for there to be some suspense. A loose remake of the 1978 Joe Dante vehicle Piranha this movie owes as much to Jaws as it does to its forebear. In fact Aja references Spielbergs classic so many times that we expect the shark to make a cameo. Piranha 3D copies some of Jaws underwater shots uses strains of John Williams iconic music in the score and even brings back good old Matt Hooper. Now the name ""Hooper"" isnt used (for legal reasons I assume) but the character is called ""Matt"" hes played by Richard Dreyfuss and has an affinity for ""Show Me the Way to Go Home."" Nuff said. This prologue by the way is presented in such a manner that it works differently for those who have seen Jaws than for those who havent. For most of Piranha 3D Aja skates along the line separating satire/camp from horror without straying into the realm of outright parody. But he clearly enjoys having fun with the conventions of the genre. Theres a naughty skinny dipping scene in which the naked women (Kelly Brook Riley Steele) perform an underwater ballet that is not withouta| ahema| artistic qualities. The gore is excessive and over-the-top as would be expected. And there are appearances of varying length by actors with recognizable names like Elisabeth Shue Ving Rhames Christopher Lloyd and the aforementioned Dreyfuss who has openly chuckled about the size of his paycheck. Most of the heavy lifting at least insofar as the ""acting"" is concerned is performed by Shue Steven R. McQueen and Jerry OConnell. The story is set during Spring Break at Lake Victoria (Arizona). The local sheriff Julie Forester (Shue) has a full plate this year. Not only has her town been overrun by unruly teenagers but theres a mysterious death to be accounted for. She worries that something unsavory is lurking beneath the surface of the lake but not even she suspects the large school of mutant piranhas that are down there waiting to fill up their bellies with oversexed underdressed college kids. Accompanied by her faithful deputy sidekick (Rhames) Julie goes out to keep order commanding her 18-year-old son Jake (Steven R. McQueen) to watch his younger sister and brother. More interested in being a tour guide for Wild Wild Girls empresario Derrick Jones (Jerry OConnell who has boasted hes playing Joe Francis the sleazy Girls Gone Wild honcho) than in experiencing any adventures in babysitting Jake pays his siblings cash to keep quiet and stay out of trouble. He goes out on a boat with Derrick two often-naked women and Kelly (Jessica Szohr) the girl he has a crush on. All of this wet t-shirt contest included occurs as the hungry piranhas get closer. For B-movie exploitation fans theres little (if anything) that Piranha 3D doesnt offer. Those who prefer more straightforward horror/monster movies may at times become irritated by all the winking and nodding done by Aja but the man (whose previous credits include High Tension and the remake of The Hills Have Eyes) understands how to employ shock tactics even in something like this. Piranha 3D isnt played strictly for laughs. In fact significant portions are intended to be taken seriously - at least as seriously as a movie about man-eating killer fish can be taken. Of course theres plenty of humor. One of the best visual gags involves a piranhas reaction to something floating in the water that may or may not be edible. And when a stripper is devoured two parts of her anatomy prove to be indigestible. It wouldnt be Piranha 3D without the ""3D"" but it would be less expensive and more enjoyable. Once again a movie is visually damaged by a shoddy 2D-to-3D conversion. The opening credits are almost unreadable and there are scenes that are blurry and indistinct. To his credit Aja has corrected the brightness problem - the movie does not look like its taking place in a cave. There are also some retro 3D shots like a girl vomiting at the audience that hearken back to ""classic"" 3D when it was an unapologetic gimmick. Most of the time however the 3D is unremarkable and unnecessary - a means of jacking up the ticket price by 40%. For those who think the sight of two naked women cavorting underwater in 3D is worth the extra money let me disabuse you of that notion - the scene will look just as good in 2D. Probably better in fact. Ultimately Piranha 3D is like Sex and the City 2. Those with interest have already seen it; everyone else has given it a wide berth. It will please adherents of the genre and gross-out those with less bloody appetites. Bottom line its good dirty fun and Aja should be applauded for understanding the genre and delivering exactly what the audience wants and expects. Plus the cliffhanger/punch-line ending need not cause even a moments frustration (although its still worth a hearty chuckle) since Piranha 2-3D has already been announced.

Elizabeth Weitzman Friday August 20 2010 345 PM Title Piranha 3D ""Beer sun and naked honeys making out under water"" is what director Alexandra Aja promises and gleefully delivers with ""Piranha 3D."" He doesnt stint on the blood either though if youre looking for signs of intelligent life--well did you really expect to find them in a remake of a Seventies B-movie anyway? Aja sets his rib-nudging tone early sending Richard Dreyfusss fisherman out to the water looking just like his scruffy ""Jaws"" scientist. Its only moments before hes discovered the dangers that lurk beneath the surface of Arizonas Lake Victoria prehistoric piranhas whove been released from their ancient cave by an earthquake. Unfortunately their timing couldnt be worse (or better for them) spring break has just brought thousands of barely-clad bodies ready to be bitten. Among the revelers are several strippers (including ""Playboy"" cover girl Kelly Brook) shooting a movie for Jerry OConnells odious Derrick who runs a ""Girls Gone Wild""-style empire.To guide his crew around the lake Derrick hires local teen Jake (Steven R. McQueen grandson of another Steve McQueen). Jake and his crush Kelly (""Gossip Girl""s Jessica Szohr) board Derricks party boat with equal parts curiosity and nervousness but before long Jakes mom Julie (Elisabeth Shue) calls in a panic. She happens to be the sheriff and its up to her and assistants Adam Scott and Ving Rhames to get every kid--especially Julies--off the lake before its too late. Every remake needs a reason and Ajas seems to be to see how much he can get away with. Those who need to sneak into an R-rated movie to see naked girls will be especially grateful since dropped bikinis propel much of the plot. And as a cameo from ""Hostel"" director Eli Roth (hosting a wet t-shirt contest) suggests there is gore galore amusingly enhanced by appropriately cheesy 3-D effects. There are few real scares though and even fewer actual laughs.  Despite several obvious gags Aja never captures the spoofy fun of the 1978 original which was directed by Joe Dante written by John Sayles and produced by Roger Corman. Their goal was to mock--and capitalize on--the ""Jaws"" phenomenon. Ajas is to make a quick buck using the very same formula that motivates Derrick his shamelessly cynical soft-core king.

Comments (1) Piranha 3D Rated R  88 minutes  2010 Mayhem ensues after a seismic tremor propels thousands of huge repulsive piranhas into a lake occupied by hordes of drunken college students on spring break. This moderately entertaining popcorn thriller recaptures the B-movie spirit of such vintage schlockmeisters as Samuel Z. Arkoff and Roger Corman (the latter of whom produced the original Piranha in 1978) even as it pays tribute to Jaws (Richard Dreyfuss reprises his character from the Spielberg film and Elisabeth Shue takes over for Roy Scheider as the town sheriff). But theres also a thick streak of Girls Gone Wild practically every scene alternates between Tamp;A and graphic computer-generated bloodshed. Alexandre Aja (The Hills Have Eyes) directed; with Ving Rhames Christopher Lloyd and Eli Roth.

A triple whammy of abrupt plot twists (Ill let the movie spring them) has these guys being run ragged by a vengeful posse of blue-painted Picts -- primordial Brits with Scottish accents and Viking faces. Up to now writer-director Neil Marshall has specialized in horror movies but in Centurion he imagines and communicates a remote world with terrific energy and a passion for detail. Michael Fassbender gives a magnetic lead performance here as Quintus the most stubborn and resourceful of the Roman band. Hes backed by a strong ensemble of macho charmers with chiseled faces (Dominic West Liam Cunningham) as well as Imogen Poots as the Druidic lass who lives as an outcast in the forest. Marshalls excellent direction only becomes rushed when the Picts approach Poots hut to search for the Romans. Their supposed fear of this beautys reputation for witchcraft isnt persuasively conveyed so youre obliged to wonder why these otherwise relentless brutes dont just go busting in. In the end though this matters little. Centurion may bring to mind such recent armored entertainments as Pathfinder and the Bruckheimer King Arthur but (and this is no small compliment) its craftsmanship and freedom from pretension suit it more to comparisons with Anthony Manns two classic-pursuit Westerns The Naked Spur and Man of the West. (F.X. Feeney) (Citywide) A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - CHASING 3000 The pitch probably went something like this Its a road-trip/coming-of-age tale based on a true story a tearjerker for manly men told largely in flashback to 1972 in which a surly but good-hearted teen (Trevor Morgan) and his younger brother who has muscular dystrophy (Rory Culkin) attempt to drive -- on a learners permit -- from California to Pittsburgh to see baseball great Roberto Clemente reach his 3000th hit. The sound track is composed of stock nostalgia triggers like the Rascals ""Good Lovin"" Three Dog Nights ""Mama Told Me Not to Come"" and Americas ""Horse With No Name."" Throw in a beleaguered single mom (Lauren Holly) for the two boys a lovable ethnic immigrant grandpa (Seymour Cassel) and a cast of quirky types encountered on the road (including grizzly but kind bikers). Thread it all with broadstroke paeans to old-fashioned heroism and the days before sports heroes became cynical commodities and its a movie. No that probably wasnt the pitch but toss in the visual style and nearly profanity-free language of a Disney Channel movie and youve nut-shelled writer-director Gregory J. Lanesys Chasing 3000 co-written by Bill Mitka whose own family life inspired the movie. Its a tapestry of cinematic cliches in the service of fictionalized memoir pushed just past serviceability by some great old footage of Clemente and affecting performances by Morgan Culkin and Holly. (Ernest Hardy) (Mann Chinese)THE KID CHAMACO In his famous essay on Casablanca Umberto Eco explained that films appeal in terms of the interplay -- the ""conversation"" -- among its numerous platitudes. ""Two cliches make us laugh"" he writes ""a hundred cliches move us."" An apt characterization perhaps of the experience of taking in Michael Curtizs classic but it scarcely speaks to the majority of films composed of hackneyed narrative tropes. It certainly doesnt characterize Miguel Necoecheas The Kid Chamaco a decidedly unmoving boxing picture that gives us for starters such played-out creations as the ghetto kid from an abusive family who sees sports as the way out the washed-up prizefighter looking for one more chance and the do-gooder atoning for a past mistake. Necoecheas film a U.S.-Mexican co-production starring Alex Perea as young would-be boxing champ Abner -- alongside such American stalwarts as Martin Sheen and Michael Madsen -- is so determined to juggle as many narrative elements as possible that it never properly focuses on any single one. Instead were treated to subplots involving Abners meth-addicted girlfriend and a romance between his prostitute sister and his trainer which leads to a scene of such melodramatic absurdity that it negates any remaining shred of narrative credibility the film had managed to retain. (Andrew Schenker) (Mann Chinese)MESRINE This two-part tale of French gangster-showman Jacques Mesrine is as densely packed and serially rambling as a well-trafficked Wikipedia entry. Director Jean-Francois Richet who whipped up not-bad mayhem in his Assault on Precinct 13 remake devotes so much time to tallying his subjects career milestones and highlights -- all of them it seems -- that any insight into the supercriminal falls by the wayside. Mesrines jaw-dropping record of flamboyant crimes and repeat prison breaks would seem to guarantee an exciting portrait but Richet proves maddeningly loath to edit his material and his charismatic star Vincent Cassel does not delve deep. Part One opens with Cassel and film in 70s drag (stache split screens) and previews the gangsters deadly ambush by cops in an unmarked truck before returning to his beginnings. Part One also establishes the directors wearisome approach; his daisy chain of capers and hideouts with no feel for which events to dwell on suggests an impatience with basic storytelling. No small problem too is that the film yields only a rudimentary feel for what it was like to live in France or Canada in the 60s and 70s if you werent a gangster in a movie. How can you get a sense of a folk hero or media obsession without context? Part Two dives into the 70s and sees Mesrine notching up another prison escape cycling through disguises and ratcheting up his media provocations. This is buffet-style biopic about as epic as Cassels dutifully acquired second-half potbelly and no more profound.

Shes gotta have it -- chlamydia that is -- but its an unplanned pregnancy that sets director Quentin Lees self-distributed indie in motion. As it happens Angela keeps homemade collectors cards of her conquests and soliciting the help of Ricky from My So-Called Life she revisits the various caricatures whove strewn seed inside of her in recent memory including a big-schlonged stalker a two-pump chump and a bend-over boyfriend. In hysterics yet? Head and shoulders above this rabble is possible father Jefferson Lee (Archie Kao) whos also in the running for city council. Hes a Republican but totally great at making homemade pizza and tells Angela encouraging things like ""You know you really should show your art"" (she shouldnt). When alls done Angela has learned a challenging moral to pass along to her baby ""The most important thing is You do what you want."" If this advice is followed no one will finish The People Ive Slept With which has notably liberated itself from the fusty tradition that a sex comedy should either titillate or tickle an audience. (Nick Pinkerton) (Sunset 5)GO PIRANHA 3-D An earthquake has opened an undersea chasm unleashing a gazillion piranha near an Arizona resort town that just happens to be jammed with spring-break partiers anxious to frolic in the pretty blue lake. Horny horror-movie revelers tend to deserve whats coming to them a sentiment French-born director Alexandre Aja embraces with maniacal glee in a third-act massacre thats downright ruthless (as were Ajas debut feature High Tension and his remake of The Hills Have Eyes). The human prey get filleted in 3-D no less a technology thats deployed effectively -- as when one piranha or another is plucked from the computer-animated horde and paraded past the moviegoers nose -- but also shamelessly as when a naked woman points her breasts directly at the camera and shimmies. Irredeemable and yet the movie written by Pete Goldfinger and Josh Stolberg is too funny and the filmmaking too self-aware to be truly offensive. Some wonder why the Oscar-nominated Elisabeth Shue agreed to star in such obvious trash but maybe when she read the part in the script where the piranha deliver a riotously gruesome but poetically just comeuppance to the storys most egregious misogynist she laughed her way to saying ""Yes."" (Chuck Wilson) (Citywide)TAKERS ""Come drink with me from the goblet of destruction"" quotes T.I.s bank robber (from Genghis Khan) before Takers big heist kicks off--and hes not joking. Acting as both producer and plot fulcrum T.I. is the big human attraction in Takers possessing the raw energy that charisma vacuums Paul Walker and Hayden Christensen (front and center) lack. Director John Luessenhop works around them in this cheerfully derivative attempt to merge the epically ponderous L.A.-scapes of Michael Manns Heat (criminals versus police with equal screen time for both) with the digital blur of Michael Manns Collateral but with far more firepower. At least a third of the running time is taken up by car and foot chases (Chris Brown still cant act but his parkour is excellent) long Entourage-esque stretches fetishizing expensive clothing and a generous dose of explosions. The editing is Bourne-fast but mostly coherent and the plot reversals (no matter how flatly acted) actually do surprise. Gravel-voiced cop Matt Dillon (evidently aging into his Clint Eastwood years ahead of schedule) in pursuit of T.I.s merry band is the only other person as compelling as the impeccable action. Thats more than enough to entertain; this is the best baseline-competent action movie to come out all summer.

You see an earthquake has opened up a passage beneath the lake to a creepy cave filled with the blighters.Were in Lake Victoria Ariz. a tiny beautiful hamlet of 5000 on an equally lovely lake.Unfortunately for the town and its sheriff Julie Forester (Elisabeth Shue) its spring break and the lake has been besieged by thousands of sex- booze- and beach-jonesing college kids eager to shed their clothes and their inhibitions. Aja slides into serious soft-core porn territory his cameras closely caressing every bikini-clad coed in sight. The crowd gyrates and yelps in some kind of collegiate fertility dance.Things get creepier with the entrance of sleazy porn producer Derrick Jones (Jerry OConnell) and his two-woman harem. In a stroke of cinema synchronicity Derrick hires the sheriffs eldest son Jake (Steven R. McQueen grandson of late great movie star Steve McQueen) to scout locations for his next Girls Gone Wild-esque flick.Thats about as complex as the plot gets.About halfway through the film the loud loutish college kids get their own when the piranhas show up.Sounds awful no? Somehow Aja manages to turn this ugly beast into a beautifully choreographed 3D tone poem about lust sex death and mayhem.The picture owes much of its success to Ajas ruthless editorial scalpel. As in his 2003 breakout hit High Tension he strips away all the inessential prattle that makes most monster flicks such unwatchable dross.There are no attempts to make the story seem more rational or plausible with chin-scratcher monologues by sincerehead scientists.There are no lachrymose backstories about the hero. Sheriff Forester isnt a recovering alcoholic traumatized war vet or disgraced big-city cop trying to redeem herself. Shes not in an abusive relationship.We know nothing about her except the essentials Shes a competent take-charge cop who loves her kids.Most refreshing still theres a conspicuous absence of sentimentality the gooey glue that holds together so many bad films.Ajas film is entirely about bodies in motion. Unhappily this also means it is devoid of the qualities that made Jaws a masterpiece - memorable characters.Aja does manage to sneak in in a gruesome eye-gouging limb-ripping kind of way a social message The same hypersexualized men and women who see each other as nothing but flesh are ripped apart by equally voracious predators. (The film sure gives the phrase ""meat market"" a whole new meaning.)A moral to the story? Then again that could just be another one of the films many in-jokes.Ajas frequent ironic nod to the great gorefests of yore and his insider jokes make you wonder if Piranha 3D isnt some kind of PoMo deconstruction of American genre films - after all thats been a preoccupation of overeducated French visitors since Alexis de Tocqueville.Is it a critique of American hedonism and the films TV shows and music that propagate it?Sure why not.What really matters is that the film works. Its a genuinely suspenseful no-holds-barred masterpiece of sex n horror exploitation.Piranha 3D A1/2 (out of four stars)Directed by Alexandre Aja. With Elisabeth Shue Ving Rhames Christopher Lloyd Jerry OConnell Adam Scott Eli Roth Steven R. McQueen and Richard Dreyfuss.

After shes dragged the first mangled body from filthy Lake Victoria (""Jaws alert Its Richard Dreyfusss) she considers closing the lake. But Deputy Rhames sees revenue. For it is spring break. A team of seismologists is on the scene and a boat crosses the lake while shooting Internet porn. If what youve been craving is two nude women rubbing chests underwater while the lilting opera of Leo Delibess Lakme fills the soundtrack then you are Penthouse magazines most cultured subscriber.The films centerpiece is a massacre at a wet T-shirt contest which the horror director Alexandre Aja has a good time staging (yes Eli Roth we see you with the water gun). But it feels like an imitation of B-movie beach schlock and John Waters. The visual humor lacks wit or nerve. A shot of the floating penis would have been funnier had the movie built a joke around it. Instead its another hovering digital prop. The hateful final shot makes it possible for Aja to strike again perhaps in a new location.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Piranha 3D is the ultimate adolescent fantasy suggesting an unholy marriage between Maxim and Fangoria consummated on the big screen in three dimensions. Like so many contemporary remakes it bears only a passing resemblance to its ostensible inspiration The only things it has in common with the Roger Corman-produced John Sayles-scripted Joe Dante-directed 1978 Jaws homage/parody are a bunch of piranhas with an insatiable hunger for human flesh. Then again Dantes infinitely superior original didnt boast a naked underwater skank ballet or 3-D vomiting so Piranha 3D has got that going for it. Elisabeth Shue leads a large overqualified mostly wasted cast as the tough-as-nails sheriff of a coastal town facing a horrible invasion in the form of a hideous Joe Francis-like parasite (Jerry OConnell well within his wheelhouse of playing overly exuberant frat boys) intent on exploiting the local youth. The town then faces a slightly bigger threat in the form of swarms of rapacious prehistoric piranhas in feeding-frenzy mode. Director Alexandre Aja established himself as a skilled craftsman of gory fare like High Tension and The Hills Have Eyes yet he inexplicably wastes a good hour of the film with extraneous subplots involving OConnells horndog sleaze merchant and a non-starting romance between the incredibly bland male teenage lead and his equally undistinguished female counterpart. Aja seems to have reserved all his energy and enthusiasm for an insanely bloody third act where the action literally devolves into a bloodbath and scores of extras meet unkind fates particularly an unfortunate young woman who loses her bikini top in the most gruesome least erotic fashion imaginable. Piranha 3D boasts at least two killer gross-out gags/deaths although one has been spoiled by its prominent placement in the films commercials and the other by a lawsuit Francis mouthpieces threatened to file against the filmmakers for defaming his character. (What character?) Piranha 3D realizes its guilty-pleasure camp potential for about a minute and a half proving yet again that theres no concept so foolproof filmmakers cant screw it up.

When you go into a movie called Piranha 3D you know just what you want and in this case the movie delivers. Its trash but bloody watchable trash. A girl dangling from a hang-glider dips into the water and emerges all screams as a dripping stump of a torso. Bodies get sucked down into schools of piranha as though they are being lowered into garbage disposals and they come up as half-faceless chunks of human sashimi -- or in the case of one unfortunate guy with his legs nibbled down to the bone and his vital organ missing. (Have no fear it shows up moments later -- theres no body part in this movie too precious to be fish food.) The piranha themselves are enjoyably gnarly little chomp monsters with ancient rusty scaled skin and teeth that look like something out of a museum dinosaur exhibit. Given that the movie is set during spring break with a bounty of topless beauties in full gyrating head-thrashing girl-on-girl glory it might almost have been called Jaws Gone Wild. Piranha 3D was directed by Alexandre Aja who made the dull 2006 remake of The Hills Have Eyes but this much can be said for his direction here Its hard to imagine how scenes of mass dismemberment set during a wet T-shirt contest could be staged any better. The youth-bacchanal setting is part of the movies nostalgic-cheese factor fusing 70s grindhouse fodder (the original Piranha directed by Joe Dante came out in 1978) with 80s party-down fervor. Its like an MTV apocalypse. I call Piranha 3D ""exploitation"" rather than a quality scare movie because it serves up well-timed gross-outs instead of genuine suspense and because the movie has no pretense of providing character plot acting or dialogue thats anything more than boilerplate. Its amusing to see Richard Dreyfuss in an opening cameo wearing his wool cap from Jaws and Christopher Lloyd lends overripe drama to the line ""This particular piranha...vanished off the face of the earth...two million years ago"" Jerry OConnell yuks it up as a soft-core filmmaker obviously meant to evoke the sleazo entrepreneur of a certain nice-girls-are-exhibitionists-too video series and Elisabeth Shue as a cop and worried mother does some vintage furrowed-brow paycheck acting. As for the 3-D its not even mentioned in the films onscreen title perhaps because the movie wasnt even shot with 3-D cameras. No matter.

TWITTER ""Piranha 3D"" is a pitch-perfect guilty-pleasure serving of late-summer schlock that handily nails the tongue-in-cheek spirit of the Roger Corman original. During the past few months we have been bombarded by 3D toys cats and dogs green ogres airbenders and even hip-hop dancers but conspicuously missing from that multidimensional lineup have been totally naked honeys making out in an underwater ballet. Successfully rectifying that situation is ""Piranha 3D"" a pitch-perfect guilty-pleasure serving of late-summer schlock that handily nails the tongue-in-cheek spirit of the Roger Corman original. That 1978 release a goof on Steven Spielbergs ""Jaws"" and its spawn was directed by Joe Dante with a script by John Sayles and would be followed by a lesser James Cameron-directed 1981 sequel of sorts as well as a forgettable 1995 TV redo. But director Alexandre Aja who worked his remake magic with 2006s atmospheric ""The Hills Have Eyes"" gets it mainly right assisted by a lively CG boost and a game cast that really gets into the spirit of things. Boasting a generous R-rated carnal/carnage quotient the movie deemed too hot for Comic-Con -- nice marketing there Dimension -- should handily hit its targeted young-male demo. The requisite tone quickly is established during an opening sequence in which the camera zooms in on a drunk guy fishing on a boat. The presumed first victim turns out to be none other than Richard Dreyfuss in full Matt Hooper ""Jaws"" garb and reprising ""Show Me the Way to Go Home."" Cut to typically boisterous spring-break festivities over on the otherwise-sleepy Lake Victoria (played by Lake Havasu Ariz.) where Jerry OConnell gleefully piles on the depravity as a Joe Francis-esque video chronicler of any activity involving bikini-clad babes and dependable Elisabeth Shue keeps the peace as the towns no-nonsense sheriff. While shes out investigating the cause of the bloody water her teenage son (Steven McQueen grandson of famed tough-guy Steve) is supposed to be keeping an eye on his younger siblings but OConnells offer of a gig as a location scout proves too hard to resist. ""Jaws"" it aint -- Aja exhibits little patience for such stuff as dramatic tension and tautly coiled suspense and there are some undeniable choppy bits -- but he never loses sight of the potential fun factor laid out in Pete Goldfinger and Josh Stolbergs script. Nor does he stint on the gore with a terrific assist by the veteran effects duo of Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger who truly outdo themselves with all those nibbled body parts as well as added bite by creature designer Neville Page. With the key elements in place the 3D conversion though decent really doesnt bring all that much to the party especially one also attended by Ving Rhames Adam Scott pinup Kelly Brook and an irresistibly over-the-top Christopher Lloyd pulling out all the Doc Brown stops as a wall-eyed marine-life expert.

"Movie review Piranha 3D - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Lake VictoriaMovie review Piranha 3DSpring break. A bikini-top-optional attitude. Prehistoric fish with a nasty underbite. The result is meant to be funny. But hey is it too much to ask for a few scares?August 20 2010|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic ""Piranha 3D"" the film that asks the question ""How do you like your humans filleted?"" and answers ""In large numbers please"" is trying so hard for the laughs and the allusions amid all the gore and endless bloodbath of bare naked ladies that it completely forgets to frighten anyone.And seriously though its impossible to be serious about a film like this the top priority for any horror moviemaker even when tongue is planted firmly in cheek should be building a better scare factor rather than figuring out how many 3-D boobs can be captured in a single frame.Ah but bodies and body parts a ripped shredded chewed and in the case of a particularly significant male body part spit out in all its 3-D glory a are really what this ""Jaws"" and ""Piranha"" hard-R parody is all about.The beginning is promising. Richard Dreyfuss has re-donned his Matt Hooper rumpled scientist togs from ""Jaws"" down to the glasses and goes about re-creating the classic moment a in a boat all alone on a vast body of water singing ""Show Me the Way to Go Home.""A seismic rumble cracks open an underground cavern a ""You mean a lake under the lake?"" asks Sheriff Julie Forester (Elisabeth Shue). Why yes my pretty a one that is filled with prehistoric piranhas. Now forgive me if I dont get all the science right but basically these bad boys are the scary dino-version of our modern-day nibblers which essentially means they are even uglier and angrier and remarkably precise. They can for instance remove a bikini top without drawing blood though they do invariably go back for the kill.While the 1975 classic ""Jaws"" had Steven Spielberg at the helm and ""Piranha"" in 1978 had Joe Dante ""Piranha 3D"" has Alexandre Aja. Now Aja is used to having blood on his hands from the open flesh wounds of ""High Tension"" in 2003 to his 2006 remake of Wes Cravens ""The Hills Have Eyes."" But despite showing blood-chilling promise hes still about 20000 leagues under their sea.When it comes to blood screenwriters Pete Goldfinger and Josh Stolberg who last collaborated on the 2009 lowbrow horror of ""Sorority Row"" (with Mark Rosman) have given him a lot to work with. The movie is set during spring break at a mythic Lake Victoria that draws 50000 beer-soaked bodies each year. Just to spice things up theres a thinly disguised ""Girls Gone Wild"" crew helmed by a crazed Jerry OConnell working that Speedo as director Derrick Jones.Our central good kid is Jake the sheriffs oldest son played by Steven McQueen (grandson of the late great). ""Gossip Girls"" Jessica Szohr plays Kelly the hometown girl he pines for. Most of the rest of the cast comes with descriptions rather than names theres drunk kid drunk dumb jock drunk laughing jock girl cut in half and my personal favorite propeller girl.As to the actual story a| well theres a lake packed with drunk (see above) hotties in bikinis theyre forever taking off. There are big piranha packs swarming. A few scientists stop by to throw in lines like ""youre not going to believe this."" A few law enforcements types scream ""Get out of the water now."" Mayhem everywhere enough that the fake-blood and severed-limb budget was probably the films biggest expenditure. Id try describing the gore but words just cant do justice to the damage a massive Mesozoic underbite and the occasional outboard motor can do.Besides Dreyfuss theres a very funny turn by Christopher Lloyd who does piranha risk assessment for the sheriff in his best Doc ""Back to the Future"" style. Though there are many laughs ""Piranha 3D"" never reaches the smart observational satire of say ""Scream"" and it goes seriously overboard on the gore. The upside? Youll never be afraid to go into the water again.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESMovie review Life During WartimeJuly 30 2010MORE STORIES ABOUTLake VictoriaCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-piranha-20100820,0,2911257.story",200,piranha3d11,piranha3d,latimes

With ""Piranha"" the 32-year-old carnivorous fish franchise has lost none of its bite serving up a fresh batch of spring-break revelers for the fearsome creatures to attack. Initially hatched by the Roger Corman camp and now kept alive by the cash-strapped Weinstein brothers the low-risk high-reward series steals yet another page from the ""Jaws"" playbook delivering this its third bigscreen installment in stereoscopic 3D. Gimmick-driven pic takes its ""eye-popping"" selling point so literally peepers are repeatedly shown dislodged from their owners heads; in that spirit the 3D conversion will allow Dimension to collect a premium from August auds followed by robust homevideo business. Gratuitous doesnt begin to describe French director Alexandre Ajas guilty-pleasure aesthetic. Considering an exploitation premise in which villainous fish see humans as so much succulent flesh it comes as no surprise that the sadistic ""High Tension"" helmer thinks little more of his characters. Before long one begins to suspect these piranha were engineered to gnaw through bikini tops with the bloodshed serving as an excuse for a boob show. Unlike the Joe Dante-directed John Sayles-scripted 1978 version this latest ""Piranha"" has no underlying political agenda. Instead ""Sorority Row"" scribes Peter Goldfinger and Josh Stolberg work up a rowdy party premise in which Jerry OConnell plays a Joe Francis-like sleazeball shooting ""Girls Gone Wild""-style videos on fictional Lake Victoria (actually Arizonas Lake Havasu presented with all the booty-popping subtlety of an MTV Spring Break special complete with hip-hop mood setters). The amateur porn impresario enlists local boy Jake Forester (moody ""Vampire Diaries"" star Steven R. McQueen) to help guide his yacht dragging along the teens still-innocent love interest Kelly (Jessica Szohr). Jakes supposed to be babysitting his two young siblings while his mother an unlikely sheriff played by Elisabeth Shue tries to keep all the horny college kids swarming the resort in check --  a job that would be easier if the lake werent also swarming with prehistoric piranha (larger toothier and more vicious than the South American variety). Goldfinger and Stolberg went to considerable trouble devising a pseudo-scientific plot to explain how an earthquake managed to unleash these nasty predators from an immense subterranean lake though its hard to imagine auds taking it seriously enough to alter their swimming habits (the way ""Jaws"" did 35 years earlier). By contrast ""Piranha"" is played for tongue-in-cheek appeal delivering an increasingly outrageous series of ""kills"" kicking off with a wink-wink cameo from Richard Dreyfuss (outfitted as his ""Jaws"" character and singing ""Show Me the Way to Go Home"") playing a drunken fisherman who gets far more than just a nibble. Part of the original ""Piranhas"" charm was its low-budget ingenuity which excused such shortcuts as employing goofy sound effects to make a swarm of fish seem menacing. Three decades later the basic problem still persists where the concept of being eaten alive remains far scarier than the execution. Although Aja effectively used sound design to enhance the suspense in ""High Tension"" here he relies more heavily on digital trickery (the fish themselves are CG) and gonzo 3D effects thrusting everything from projectile vomit to a dismembered member in our faces. The overall tone is fratboy-irreverent showing little respect for life (Eli Roths nasty exit is designed for a laugh) and even less for the ladies. When young female characters arent competing in wet T-shirt contests or staging elaborate lesbian fantasies theyre getting their hair caught in motorboat engines or having their swimwear devoured to offer fleeting glimpses of frontal nudity. All told ""Piranha"" is better made than it had to be more clumsily scripted than the film that inspired it (yet nowhere near as embarrassing as the earlier James Cameron-made flying-fish sequel) and rendered unexpectedly watchable by its cast Kooky scientist Christopher Lloyd makes the most of his cameo while tough-guy deputy Ving Rhames reminds the fish where they belong on the food chain. Although the film is being billed as ""Piranha 3D"" the onscreen title simply reads ""Piranha."" Except during high-concept moments when objects pop into the auditorium the 3D conversion adds little with rippling water and foreground details playing distracting tricks on the eyes.

So here in the best/worst traditions of 70s exploitation cinema are flesh-eating fishy gore lip-smacking nudity and lots of laugh-out-loud silliness. If youre looking for the anti-establishment message found in the John Sayles scripted Roger Corman-produced Jaws rip-off you will be disappointed. However the re-makes cheesy eye-popping 3D effects - flayed bodies naked breasts vomit and a severed penis are all flung out of the screen - are an authentic affectionate throwback to cheapo Cormanesque excess.When an underground earthquake releases shoals of prehistoric piranha into Lake Victoria local sheriff Julie Forester (Elizabeth Shue) tries in vain to persuade several thousand Spring Break revellers to quit their aquatic hedonism before they become fish food. Meanwhile her son Jake (Steven R McQueen) has been lured onto a pleasure boat by slimeball porn director Derrick (Jerry OConnell) and busty bikini-clad star Danni (British glamour model Kelly Brook). Also aboard is nice girl Kelly (Jessica Szohr) on whom Jake has a crush who ends up licking tequila salt and lime off the body and lips of Dannis co-star Crystal (real-life porn star Riley Steele). But once the fishy feeding frenzy starts its human flesh thats on the menu. Aja serves up the tongue-in-cheek thrills CGI-enhanced gore and gratuitous nudity with such unabashed relish that this may prove to be the summers break-out horror hit. There are also nice cameos from Richard Dreyfuss reprising his Jaws role and Hostel director Eli Roth who completely loses his head after hosting a wet T-shirt contest. A guilty pleasure? Guilty as charged.
