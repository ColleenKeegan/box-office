The Globe and Mail Published Monday Sep. 10 2012 1255PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 1255PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by J.A. Bayona Country Spain/U.S.A Language English There are many films to be made about the cataclysmic Indian Ocean tsunami of December 2004 and some viewers may consider it a strike against this one that it focuses on a privileged white family (led by Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor) in Thailand on holiday. But that would be a mistake because this true story is about as visceral immersive terrifying and heart-tugging as a movie can be. The tsunami and flood scenes are a marvel of epic filmmaking (the 3-D sound will make your teeth rattle) and the brave and vulnerable moments that occur as the family members struggle to stay alive and find one another are equally marvellous in their intimacy and humanity.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Dec. 21 2012 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Dec. 28 2012 1048AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Juan Antonio Bayona Written by Sergio G. Sanchez Starring Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor Classification PG Country USA Language English Urgent yet measured like the onrushing tide The Impossible is a real-life disaster flick with a compelling twist. The film doesnt build to the climax the tsunami that ravaged South Asia eight years ago but essentially starts with it. In the long denouement that follows one genre gives way to another the disaster to a survival tale and the suspense mounts over the looming question. In this profiled family of five - mother father and their three young sons - someone must have lived to tell the tale to put the true into the story. But who? And how? Watch The Impossible official trailer Cast members Ewan McGregor (L)  Naomi Watts (C) and Tom Holland pose at the gala presentation for the film ""The Impossible"" at the 37th Toronto International Film Festival September 9 2012. Reuters video Video Ewan McGregor Naomi Watts love The Impossibles true story First the calm before the climax. On a plane packed with tourists Henry (Ewan McGregor) and Maria (Naomi Watts) tend to their boys while preparing for touchdown fastening their seat-belts and their nerves. The Thai resort brand-new and posh welcomes them with a little surprise switching their reserved room on the third floor for another at ground level - the ocean view is better. Yes that detail like others just as neatly planted awaits the approaching menace.Spanish director Juan Antonio Bayona (who toyed with horror in his feature debut The Orphanage) works his lens in close here always controlled and never jumpy - after all this is a warm tightly knit clan off on their December holiday. Christmas Day arrives - presents are exchanged the snorkelling is gorgeous. Then the fateful morning dawns with the family at the pool under a blue sky. Obviously we know the tsunami is coming but the sheer speed of its appearance still takes us by surprise - a brief rumbling mere seconds pass a quick glance out to sea and there it is immense and inescapable.Now Bayona turns the camera loose cutting immediately to an underwater shot of Maria engulfed and violently spinning like the massive debris all around her an explosion of white froth punctuated by a white screen. A beats pause. A gasping Maria surfaces spots her eldest son Lucas gets dragged back under by a second wave surfaces again shouts his name reaches flails... The two are stunned by this eruption of raw power and so are we - the sequence is heart-stopping.The boy is unhurt but Marias leg is badly damaged cut down to the bone. However as Lucas (Tom Holland) boosts her into the relative safety of a trees upper branches its not the mangled limb that troubles him. Its the sight of his mothers breast exposed by her torn blouse and he turns his head away embarrassed even in the midst of horror - thats an exquisitely human moment. Only then does Bayona pull his camera up and out for an overhead shot. The devastation is vast. Where once there was land there is only the seething sea and all that bobs atop it not least the flotilla of mangled bodies.Thai villagers rescue them transporting Maria and Lucas along a road strewn with carnage and on to the local hospital where a different chaos reigns. In the crowded and panicky corridors the injured keep company with the dying survivors frantically seek out the lost communication is hard and misidentification is easy. Prostrate on a cot Maria moves in and out of consciousness leaving us to wonder whether shes thinking what we are Unseen since nature struck what in hell happened to Henry and the other kids?At this point the picture is barely beyond the first act but I should stop now The survival drama which is gripping mustnt be spoiled. Even to comment on the performances would run the risk of giving too much away. Lets just say that the acting is uniformly strong in what is typically not an actors genre. However it must also be said that around the two-thirds mark the film loses much of its suspense and noticeably stalls. And dont expect too many faces that arent white. Unlike in the HBO series Tsunami The Aftermath the Thai people are largely absent from their own tragedy here visible only at the edges of the frame as helpful villagers or overtaxed nurses. This is deliberately one familys perspective but from within that tourists-eye view it resonates - a harrowing account of imperilled strangers in a suddenly strange land.So if the window is narrow the gaze is not. The Impossible looks back at a natural calamity with unflinching honesty. It sees fear and pain it sees fortitude and bravery but mainly it sees this In that raging instant when the sea becomes its own monster theres precious little to separate the devoured from the spared - nothing but the thin wedge of luck.Editors note The headline on the original version of this article incorrectly stated the tsunami in reference occurred in 2006. This version has been corrected.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Its been five years since J.A. Bayona debuted with the terrifying tearjerking ghost story The Orphanage and now he makes a belated return to the directors chair with The Impossible based on the true story of a family that was visiting Thailand in 2004 when the Indian Ocean tsunami hit. The subject matter doesnt immediately seem to have much in common with The Orphanage but both films lean heavily on the bond between parents and children and both elicit sympathy via scenes of mothers and fathers faced with the loss of their kids. And like The Orphanage The Impossible confirms that Bayona is a major talent with a skill for constructing sequences that build tension as masterfully as Steven Spielberg did in his 70s heyday. The problem is that Sergio G. Sanchezs script for The Impossible isnt in the same class as Bayonas direction. The movies dialogue tends to be either functional or corny constraining the characters to one or two levels snippy concerned brave despondent et cetera. Its fortunate for Bayona that so much of The Impossibles action is visually spectacular because prior to the enormous wall of water that hits them the protagonists arent especially good company. In the films middle hour when couple Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor have to discern from moment to moment how best to find each other in a devastated foreign land Bayona smartly cans the chatter and just shows them thinking their way around obstacles telling their story mostly with pictures. Whether its a responsible choice to turn a real-life disaster into a stunning special effect--or to depict the natives of Thailand as ""obstacles"" as opposed to people whove just had their own lives upended--is worth debating further. But The Impossible ultimately isnt about the tsunami and its victims per se; its about this one family and their resourcefulness in the face of disaster. Bayonas tsunami sequence is bound to garner accolades--and rightfully so since its 10 of the most harrowing minutes moviegoers are likely to see this year--but the film is filled with smaller but no less gripping scenes of the characters scrambling toward each other agonizingly slowly amid a landscape of wreckage and strangers. On the whole The Impossible is a superb example of the ""man against the elements"" film driven by the panic that sets in when one family member fears never seeing the others again. With that as his starting point Bayona deftly pushes the audiences buttons.

"In The Impossible one familys tsunami saga - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate In The Impossible one familys tsunami saga Share Tweet This is a test player. Share Tweet By Ty Burr Globe Staff | 01.03.13 | 327 PM The Impossible"" is an earnest extremely grueling prodigiously crafted true-life drama that takes one of the worst natural disasters in recorded history and reduces it to a bad day at Club Med. All right make that a very bad day. When the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami hits without warning in the films opening minutes we see it through the terrified eyes of the films protagonists a British family vacationing at a Thai beach resort. The father Henry (Ewan McGregor) is in the pool with the younger boys Thomas (Samuel Joslin) and Simon (Oaklee Pendergast). Oldest son Lucas (Tom Holland) is off to the side having an adolescent sulk. And mother Maria (Naomi Watts) is crouched before a pool houses glass walls as she looks up to see distant palm trees crashing down and a wall of brown water crest high above the roof of the resort. Related Link Find showtimes and theaters The following 20 minutes put the audience right in the middle of the maelstrom. Swept underwater into a raging current Maria collides with cars and tree branches like pathetically vulnerable flotsam gets reunited in mid-cataract with Lucas and eventually comes to earth far inland grievously wounded. These scenes have an immediacy that obliterates an audiences bearings as easily as it does the familys casual tourist entitlement. Director Juan Antonio Bayona and his production and effects teams want to show us what disaster looks like from the very center and they succeed all too well. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Yet ""The Impossible"" becomes steadily more ordinary as it drags itself from the high-water mark back to safety. Amidst the tinderstick wreckage Maria and Lucas take refuge in a tree with an imperturbable little boy (Johan Sundberg); our one good look at the injury to the mothers leg -- a shocking hole of ragged flesh -- raises the stakes to unbearable levels. Henry meanwhile has found his other two sons and is desperate to locate his wife and Lucas. The film becomes an ""Incredible Journey""-style ordeal that highlights the drama of one family against a backdrop of human chaos. Which has its problems. The actual family to whom these events occurred is Spanish (as are the filmmakers) and the decision to change that family into Nordic-looking English-speaking characters who can be played by globally recognizable movie stars is odd but understandable at least from a commercial standpoint. (In any event the movie was a huge hit in Spain.) And the tragic truth is that of the estimated 5400 dead in Thailand (total fatalities for the region approached a staggering 230000) nearly half were foreigners most of them vacationing Europeans. The 523 Swedish dead alone represented the countrys worst loss since the Battle of Poltava in 1709. So this particular approach has context and plenty of it. Yet ""The Impossible"" still plays unsettlingly like a tragedy visited only on wealthy white folks because the focus is so narrow and because Sergio G. Sanchezs screenplay barely acknowledges other kinds of peoples suffering. There are Thai locals in the movie -- pulling Maria to safety and getting her on a truck to the hospital assisting Lucas when he briefly loses his mother kindly overseeing the necessary surgeries and evacuations. Theyre there. Theyre just the Help. The acting it should be noted is excellent if in extremis. Watts believably travels from stressed competence (Marias a doctor) to a state shockingly near death and McGregor has a scene involving a cellphone where you can see Henrys stoic attempts to hold it together give way completely. The most striking performance in the films most realized role comes from Holland whose character has to grow up in a matter of hours and -- under prodding from Maria -- reach out to assist others. Actually the look on Lucass face as he discovers his own altruism may be the best special effect in the film. ""The Impossible"" is frustratingly myopic but at least one of its protagonists learns to see. Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. Follow him on Twitter tyburr.

Summit Entertainment photo JOSE HARO Ewan McGregor in ""The Impossible."" Summit Entertainment photo JOSE HARO (From left) Samuel Joslin Ewan McGregor and Oaklee Pendergast in ""The Impossible."" Perilous incidents have riveted audiences since Pauline was tied to the railroad tracks but in the hundred-year history of cinema few thrillers have been as emotionally compelling as ""The Impossible.""While this true story about the Asian tsunami of 2004 offers state-of-the-art special effects its built upon the basic unit of drama the family.The Bennetts a British family vacationing on a Thai island are businessman Henry (Ewan McGregor) doctor Maria (Naomi Watts) and their sons Lucas Thomas and Simon (Tom Holland Samuel Joslin and Oaklee Pendergast). Although the family seems affluent and happy as they play with their presents on Christmas Day there is a minimum of backstory before the disaster that will define their characters. On the morning of Dec. 26 the earth shudders the birds scatter and a wall of water sweeps across the island like a bomb blast.That epic scene is breathtaking not only for the human and natural toll it evokes but for the cinematic craft it represents. (Somewhere Cecil B. DeMille is commanding his crew to reimagine the Red Sea.)For most of the film we follow the critically wounded Maria and the overwhelmed Lucas as they slog through the wreckage toward higher ground. In Hollands extraordinary performance we watch a terrified boy become a brave young man jolted into an awareness of death but then moved to help others starting with his own half-naked mother. In the tangle of tree limbs they find an abandoned toddler whose wordless trust inspires them to keep moving toward a village a hospital and a possible reunion with the rest of their family.The subsequent turn of events elicits such at torrent of tears that its easy to overlook the hand of director Juan Antonio Bayona (""The Orphanage"") as hes pulling our strings. This is deft artistry applied to resonant raw material.

The Impossible is inspired by the Alvarez Belons a Spanish family of five who survived the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami that claimed almost 300000 lives; in the film the Iberian quintet has been remade into the more ""relatable"" British clan headed by Ewan McGregor (as businessman Henry) and Naomi Watts (as Maria a physician who left her practice to be a full-time mom). Currently stationed in Japan Henry Maria and their three boys ranging in age from about five to 12 have arrived in Khao Lak Thailand for the Christmas holiday. The enormous waves that battered that country (and many others) on December 26 are staggeringly staged by director J.A. Bayona (2007s The Orphanage)--a feat of dubious distinction. (Does verisimilitude to actual disaster serve any purpose besides as Susan Sontag wrote allowing ""one [to] participate in the fantasy of living through ones own death""?) Separated from Henry and the two younger children Maria--trailing pools of blood from a muscle-deep gash as she deliriously trudges through brackish water--and the oldest son Lucas (Tom Holland) eventually make it to a chaotic hospital. These horrors and the absorbing performances of Watts and McGregor will soon be undermined by a surfeit of sentiment.

Sanchez hits you like a tidal wave By Mary Pols MaryPolsDec. 20 2012 Share Read Later Summit Entertainment The Impossible Year 2012 Director Juan Antonio Bayona Studio Summit Entertainment Actors Naomi Watts Ewan McGregor Tom Holland Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture The Impossible a feature film based on the true account of a Spanish familys experiences during Indonesias devastating 2004 tsunami opens in darkness with a dull roar. A calm blue ocean appears on the screen then a plane screams into the frame as if catapulted from the projection booth. The start-stop motion jolts you into the churning turbulent reality of The Impossible in this cinematically recreated hell youre going to see feel and practically taste everything. The Impossible is technologically a marvel--the tsunami experience is harrowingly believable--but also emotionally rich. I hesitate to use this term since it is so often equated with hokey but The Impossible is life-affirming. The noisy plane swooping over the ocean brings the Belon family to Thailand to spend the Christmas holiday on the beach. Henry Belon (Ewan McGregor) has a big job in Japan while Maria (Naomi Watts) trained as a doctor stays home with their three young sons. Obviously the Belons are no longer Spanish. Maybe Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz werent available? Or maybe if you can get Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor in your movie you just make accommodations to the narrative. But its worth noting that of the estimated 282000 people who died or disappeared in the tsunami only about 1000 were European so the filmmakers were already starting from a point that could be contentious--what about all those dark skinned residents of the Third World who died or lost everything? Turning the Spaniards into blue-eyed blonde Brits only exacerbates the sense that this is a story about a very small well-to-do segment of the victim pool. (READ Times list of 12 disaster movies that top Titanic) However The Impossible moves so fast that theres scarcely any time to catch your breath let alone dwell on such matters. Director Juan Antonio Bayona and writer Sergio G. Sanchez made a name for themselves with 2007s elegant slow-simmering horror film The Orphanage but this time they skip the tantalizing buildup. A typical Hollywood production would require someone to have an argument or misunderstanding prior to the wave hitting just to heighten regrets and increase the sense of calamity. But the loving Belon family celebrates Christmas at their paradisiacal hotel snorkel and dine by candlelight. Then in the morning they hit the pool with books and balls. The first warning they get of the oncoming wave is the clamor of departing birds. Maria is farthest back and so endures the horror of watching her eldest most independent son Lucas (the fiercely good Tom Holland) struck first then her husband and the two younger boys 5 and 7. Watts primal screams as she clings to a tree are eloquent; how could anyone so small survive something so big? When Lucas is swept past her alive she lets go and follows him. Its both a remarkable decision and completely understandable not so much bravery as maternal necessity. When the waves finally subside mother and son are battered and bloody but together. As they wade waist deep through an apocalyptic landscape you feel them forming their own fierce little unit one where all bets are off. ""Is it over?"" Lucas asks her. Its clear that Maria has always had the answers but she responds with terrifying uncertainty ""I dont know."" (READ Remember how the world was supposed to end in 2012? TIMEs Richard Corliss on 2012) There are saving graces a can of Coke plucked intact from the wreckage (its always Coke right? Remember The Road?) and the affections of a blonde boy the pair rescues but Maria is badly wounded--Lucas nearly retches when he sees the flap of flesh hanging off her leg--and the movie doesnt get any easier when the kindness of native strangers deposits them at a hospital. The wounded are zombies coughing up unrecognizable black objects bleeding on the floor too stunned to care. Maria could die of infection or from whatever it was that punched a hole in her chest underwater. ""You see that boy"" Maria tells the doctor attending her. ""Im all hes got in the world."" If youve seen the too-revealing trailer for The Impossible you know this isnt true and may think as I did that you know the whole story already. I was happy to be proved wrong; the entire familys survival--Henry and the boys have their own heartwrenching challenges--provides its fair share of suspense. Tsunamis are so unimaginable that the desire to see to experience a Biblical wall of water for oneself can run very deep (my own was the only reason to see Clint Eastwoods off-key Hereafter). The Impossible slapped some sense into my lust for disaster porn by enlightening me from this safe but still palpable distance on what its like to be keelhauled through populated areas. It left me shaken. But also strangely bolstered ready to go out there and be fiercely strong like Maria. The Impossibles lessons about disorientation and adapting to disaster--its hard not to love Maria when she binds her wound with tree branches--can be applied well beyond the tsunami scenario. As to the question everyone asks--how would I cope?--Watts Maria gives you something to aspire to. Even flat on a cot with an oxygen mask on her face Watts is constantly connecting with Lucas with the injured around her and with the audience. As an actress she gave greatly in Michael Hanekes 2007 Funny Games and in 2009s Mother and Child but in the former her performance was limited by the films single key of sadism and few saw the latter. Shes always superlative but The Impossible is Watts best performance in years. The Impossible is full of great special effects and Im enough of a natural disaster junkie that Id have seen the movie just for them but in the end what Ill remember is Marias face her cries and her determination.

(JOSE HARO/Everett Collection) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS MOVIE CRITIC Updated Thursday December 20 2012 208 PM Title The Impossible Film Info With Naomi Watts Ewan McGregor. Based-in-truth drama about a devastating tsunami. Director Juan Antonio Bayona (147). PG-13 Very disturbing images. Area theaters. As we all know there are some tragedies that are nearly incomprehensible from a distance. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was so devastating in its sudden destruction that no one outside its reach could begin to grasp its enormity. In ""The Impossible"" Spanish director Juan Antonio Bayona (""The Orphanage"") manages to re-create this experience with wrenching power. When its over you will feel enlightened drained and grateful just to walk away. Bayona narrows a potentially overwhelming focus to a single British family on vacation at a resort in Thailand. (The film has generated some controversy by changing the nationality of the Spaniards on which the story is actually based.) Its a shame that he does eventually succumb to movie tricks tying the plot together in ways designed to draw maximum sentiment. Thats an unnecessary choice given the spectacularly brutal force of the catastrophe which he stages with heartstopping strength. When the earth is upended the Bennetts are all at the pool and immediately separated. Maria (Naomi Watts) is horribly hurt but somehow connects with her stunned tween son Lucas (Tom Holland). We follow them through the waters as they try to find lifesaving help. Meanwhile Henry (Ewan McGregor) rescues their two little boys but has no idea if Maria or Lucas are still alive. There is no method of communication no reliable transport and no medical care for anyone who isnt on the edge of death. Watts follows her directors lead and pulls out all the emotional stops for her performance. McGregor is much more low-key a necessary balance to his co-stars intensity. The most memorable turn however comes from young Holland. There is not a moment in which Lucas fear or unexpected courage feels less than real. We all pray we never have to face situations such as this one. But perhaps we re-create them to remind ourselves that miracles are as often as not man-made.

The Impossible (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Impossible (PG-13) A familys courage under fire (and water) Naomi Watts and Tom Holland in The Impossible. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle | cogleMiamiHerald.com1/3/2013 Editor rating 2.5 The jawdropping truth of The Impossible is of course that what happens in the film was possible at least for a Spanish family caught in the South Asia tsunami that killed more than 200000 people a day after Christmas in 2004. In Juan Antonio Bayonas film based on the true story of Maria Balon the familys nationality is shifted to British to account for the casting of Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor as tourists who check into a Thai hotel with their three young sons for a holiday vacation and end up facing an unthinkable disaster. The film doesnt offer much back story; we learn that Henry (McGregor) works in Japan but worries about being laid off and that Maria (Watts) is a doctor whos not practicing at the moment to stay home and raise her boys. Like big brothers everywhere oldest son Lucas (Tom Holland) wants his little brothers to stop pestering him. But we know all we need to know going in. Who they are doesnt matter; what they will endure and how they will behave under unthinkable pressure is what counts. Their first days in Thailand are idyllic the stuff of any vacation beach; pool; dinners under the stars. Then one day with no warning a wall of water crashes down on the resort separating the terrified family. The rest of The Impossible focuses on their efforts to survive get help -- and find each other alive or dead. If youve read about Balon theres no mystery about what will eventually happen but the very nature of the disaster proves impossible to dismiss even when you know the outcome. The film is best in the scenes immediately after the tsunami hits when Maria being swept along by a crushing current of water spots Lucas nearby and the two scream for each other helplessly as theyre dragged past debris dead bodies even a car floating by with a crying child inside. Bayona is restrained here in terms of gore but his landscape is a realistic vision of a hell we never hope to visit. Besides imagination proves capable of conjuring the darker sights survivors probably had to endure in the days after escaping destruction. The Impossibles pace inevitably slows after the initial rush once Maria and Lucas find themselves at a refugee hospital (one powerful shot swings out the doors of the makeshift trauma center to reveal the staggering magnitude of the relief effort). Lucas story in particular is unnerving and young Holland gives an outstanding performance of conveying sheer terror one moment and surprising courage the next. If his childish delight when something good finally happens doesnt bring tears to your eyes you might want to check for a pulse. Once the perspective shifts away from Maria and Lucas though The Impossible starts to feel a bit stretched and ultimately devolves into a series of near misses as one character walks down a hallway seconds before another passes by. Its as if the filmmakers tried to maximize tension to deliver an emotional punch. But there wasnt any need to manufacture drama. While it may have been changed for the screen this story of a familys ordeal is one from which any parent -- any person really -- cant turn away. Cast Naomi Watts Ewan McGregor Tom Holland.

Starring Naomi Watts Tom Holland and Ewan McGregor. Directed by Juan Antonio Bayona. (PG-13. 114 minutes.) Movies about disasters are mostly about the survivors. Holocaust movies are about people who escape the Nazis and 9/11 movies are about people who flee the building in time or are discovered in the rubble. There are demands of history and there are the dramatic demands of popular movie making but sometimes those demands diverge so much that it becomes uncomfortable. If one person survives and 6 million are killed or one person gets out and 3000 are crushed its not really a happy ending - or even an adequate representation of the larger event. This is precisely the challenge that ""The Impossible"" faces and never quite overcomes though it compensates with fine performances chilling effects and director Juan Antonio Bayonas subtle sense of drama. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami is presented through the true story of a family whose Thailand vacation was interrupted by one of the worst natural catastrophes in history. In real life they were Spanish as is the director but their nationality is changed here to British presumably because more international ticket-buyers speak English.

Photo Jose Haro Summit Entertainment The Impossible review Deluge of tragedy 1 / 5 Back to Gallery Bayonas skill is evident from the movies first moments. Obviously we know the tsunami is coming and he knows that we know. But we dont know when and so he teases us particularly with his use of sound. To underlie the dialogue to underscore scenes of vacationers at the beach or lounging at poolside he introduces dissonant notes or just a subtle hum to suggest a discord between what they think is going on and what we know is about to happen. Unexpected calamity The tsunami arises with staggering suddenness. Within no more than 15 seconds an unfamiliar noise is heard in the distance becomes unignorable then alarming and then the ground shakes and everything is swept away. You might remember the tsunami scene in Clint Eastwoods ""Hereafter."" That was impressive too but it ended abruptly when the protagonist lost consciousness. Here we follow Naomi Watts as a wife and mother of three and she stays conscious throughout struggling to stay above the water dodging objects and calling out to her eldest son. Its not just one wave. Its several and so the perches that seem safe at first arent. And when its finally over we hear the silence of devastation. All is transformed and yet all is quiet as if nature itself were saying ""Oh did something happen?"" Obviously ""The Impossible"" cant top this though at this point it still has about 90 minutes left. Mom and her son (Tom Holland) are left alone in a soupy barrenness. She has a horrible leg injury - leg injury is really big among this years Oscar contenders (see ""Rust and Bone"") - and eventually she is brought to a triage center where most of ""The Impossible"" takes place. Son rises to challenge From here the movie switches to the son (Mom is unconscious for half the movie) and Holland rises to the challenge. He has awe-inspiring scenes here that convey the boys isolation terror and innate dignity the experience of getting thrown into manhood from the deep end of the pool. Watts who has some lovely moments is getting all the awards-season attention. In another weak year for womens roles thats understandable. But Hollands is the performance to take from the movie. Ewan McGregor doesnt fare nearly as well. As the husband separated from his wife and searching for her McGregor finds himself in the Oliver Hardy role in which he keeps tripping or falling through floors and screaming (""Errrrrhhhhh""). Even worse its through McGregors role that we meet other people searching for family members and this hint of the broader story makes the movies little story seem trivial. The thought intrudes - ""Who cares about these people? After all theyre fine."" In the movies last 45 minutes ""The Impossible"" takes an essentially undramatic situation and teases out a base level of interest by making the audience look forward to the familys reuniting. But the dead people just outside the edge of the frame or only slightly grieved over within the periphery were just as important every one of them. The longer the movie goes on the harder it gets to push that thought away. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

The story is based on a true one about a Spanish family -- mother father little kids -- vacationing in Thailand in 2004 when a cataclysmic earthquake in the Indian Ocean unleashed what is believed to be the single most destructive tsunami in history. Between then and now under the exquisite care of Spanish director J.A. Bayona and screenwriter Sergio G. Sanchez (who worked together so beautifully five years ago on The Orphanage) the familys impossible-but-true saga has been ethnically morphed into that of a peaches-and-cream British clan with mother and father Maria and Henry played by Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor and eldest 13-year-old son Lucas brought to life with truly outstanding gravitas by then-14-year old Tom Holland. In the deadly wall of water that rises up out of the sea and smashes the land (eyewitness accounts confirm that destruction arrived without warning) Maria and Lucas are separated from Henry and the two younger boys. What happens next is hell on earth. Its agony in a rewarding way to squirm and cringe and groan through an ordeal so realistically re-created. The impressive tsunami in Clint Eastwoods Hereafter looks blatantly CGI-ish by comparison as Bayona and cinematographer Oscar Faura convey the drawn-out physical horror of the devouring water the mud and the debris that became lethal obstructions. But all that blood-soaked horror would mean little without the movies simultaneous acute attention to emotional crisis. Its worth acknowledging the dismay of some that in the midst of the suffering by hundreds of native residents were invited to care about the problems of comfy white visitors. (More attention is paid to how brown-skinned caregivers treat tourists than to their own wounded and dying.) But such UNICEF thinking misses the larger universal story of the kind of superhuman strength that love can inspire. Flinging herself ego-free and vulnerable into the shredded skin and soul of Maria with utter conviction Watts embodies everyday maternal heroism (an overused word that here deserves its place). Hers is a beautiful performance that couldnt exist by the way without young Hollands own impressive access to the emotional truth of being a kid who must become his mothers protector. (McGregor? Equally effective.) While flooding the viewer with nerve-racking anxiety The Impossible is possibly one of the most pro-family-values movies of the year.

By David Denby Meryl Streep plays Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.   Credit Illustration by Gerald Scarfe As Margaret Thatcher in old age--confined to her home and afflicted with dementia--Meryl Streep turns senescence into poetry. Apart from the great Lear interpreters Streep in ""The Iron Lady"" has given us the best impression weve had of a potentate suffering from loss of power and fear of madness. The anxiety of forgetfulness crosses her brow in a flutter; she hesitates before speaking and then gathering her breath pulls an imperative out of the cobwebs. Her eyes darting around corners tell us that Thatcher is still alert to any challenge to her authority. Despite Streeps eloquence and wit however ""The Iron Lady"" is seriously misconceived. It would be hard no doubt for any team of British filmmakers to deal with a figure as masterful virulent and divisive as Thatcher but this bio-pic written by Abi Morgan and directed by Phyllida Lloyd is an oddly unsettled compound of glorification and malice. It whirls around restlessly and winds up nowhere. The movie is framed by--and a good forty per cent of it is taken up with--Thatcher meandering from one thing to another in her house watching family videos talking to her husband Denis (Jim Broadbent) who has been dead for eight years. She is unable to sort out reality from hallucination past from present necessary tasks from unnecessary. Thatcher the only woman to become Prime Minister of Britain is a battler who changed the countrys economy and its culture. She may have been wrong and personally dislikable even insufferable but why undermine her in this way? In part the movie celebrates in brief flashbacks what was remarkable about Margaret Roberts the daughter of a Lincolnshire grocer who entered politics at twenty-four and faced down withering gender and class prejudice from the local Tory nabobs. Alexandra Roach the actress who plays young Margaret has a slight overbite and staring blue eyes that suggest an unnerving singleness of purpose. Even as Margaret accepts a marriage proposal from the charming Denis (Harry Lloyd) shes strenuous and awkward--but also intelligent and forthright. In the nineteen-seventies she becomes a minister in the Cabinet of Edward Heath and Streep takes over turning Thatcher into a ruthless scourge of what she believes to be Conservative weakness. When she runs for Party leader she allows her hair to be teased into a lofty blond arc a sort of cotton-candy diadem. Her speech with training gets heavier and slower the emphasis landing on selected morally instructive syllables like a hammer hitting an anvil. The movie might have been titled ""The Iron Voice."" The clangorous insistence of it drives you crazy. Over and over she says the same things privatize industry bust the trade unions take responsibility for yourself. The filmmakers substitute personal assertion for politics as if Thatchers voice itself had altered the behavior of millions. Its impossible to tell how much of what she says is an accurate reading of the state of affairs and how much of it mere ideology--or how effective any of it was. Did her policies lead to the economic resurgence of the eighties? (No mention is made of North Sea oil.) In a particularly confused bit of sequencing the filmmakers make it seem that Britains enormous economic growth spurt was brought about by victory in the Falklands War in 1982. How? Morgan and Lloyd appear to object to everything about Thatcher except her early determination to stand up to men. But gumption turned into contempt and it would have been interesting to see the stages. The directorial flourishes illustrating Thatchers predominance come off as glibly sarcastic the male ministers are shot from her point of view circling around her and then backing away like livestock or running after her musical-comedy style as she rushes through the halls of Parliament. Near the end Streep pressing even harder underlines Thatchers pleasure in humiliating her Cabinet. Its a tough honest performance yet Streep has lent herself to a project of revenge against the character she plays. When Margaret accepts Deniss proposal she swears that she will not end her life washing a teacup. At the conclusion of the movie she is standing at a sink doing exactly that. This may pass for irony but its an impoverished and low-minded irony. Most of us will end up washing cups. But Margaret Thatcher smashed a lot of china before her piteous final chapter. In Steven Spielbergs ""War Horse"" the British cavalry swords drawn charges out of a hayfield at daybreak gallops across an open plain and overruns a German field camp. It is 1914 in Quievrechain France near the Belgian border. As Spielberg cuts back and forth between the armed British and the terrified Germans we realize that hes re-created a famous scene of Arab legions streaming into a Turkish encampment from his favorite movie ""Lawrence of Arabia."" But then triumph changes to something else--to the horror of a modern ""Charge of the Light Brigade."" German machine guns are waiting in the woods just behind the camp and most of the cavalry including the horses gets cut down. The sequence mixes vainglory and tragedy and it makes us think that Spielberg could have made a great First World War movie. ""War Horse"" has epic scenes of armies marching through damp woods and fighting in mucky trenches yet its essentially an animal story or to be more precise a boy-meets-horse story. In paradisal green Devon a clean-limbed English youth Albert (Jeremy Irvine) raises a bay colt he calls Joey. When his father sells Joey to a British officer Albert enlists and searches for the horse in the slaughterhouse of France. The movie is a series of pictorially splendid set pieces interlarded with broad rural and army comedy. Apart from the battle scenes much of ""War Horse"" has the feeling of nineteen-fifties family entertainment--its leisurely hearty sentimental overexplicit. There are village rowdies and plainspoken women. There is a troublesome goose that nips at mens trousers. German soldiers as well as British try to protect Joey. We get the point the concern for a wonderful animal partly redeems the carnage. But that idea is weakened by a huge literal-minded production. ""War Horse"" began life as Michael Morpurgos young-adult novel written from the point of view of the horse who turns out to have complex feelings and a decent prose style. From there it became a startling and powerful spectacle mounted by the National Theatre of Great Britain the production now being staged at Lincoln Center. Onstage each horse is a large puppet a concatenation of cane silk cables and gears worked by two men beneath the frame and one at the side operating the head and the neck. The audience becomes entranced precisely by the means of making the spectacle an absorption that aided by menacing sound and flashing light focusses attention on the devastation of war and by contrast the horsiness of a horse--the rearing twitching and nuzzling through which its nobility and affection pour out. The purity of intention behind the artifice is intensely moving. We never think to ask why a nineteen-year-old boy is so obsessed with a horse or why the entire production is devoted to an animal while ten million men are dying all around him. But when Spielberg does the story realistically with scenes of butchery and mud it seems trivial even a little daft the war stops the armies and the trenches and the hospitals are stilled so that the boy and the animal can find each other. The horses themselves are magnificent and maybe thats reason enough to see the movie. But ""War Horse"" is a bland bizarrely unimaginative piece of work. ""Mission Impossible--Ghost Protocol"" tries to out-Bond the Bonds and out-Bourne the Bournes. The movie is sheer hurtling mechanism--the entire world in motion--and its great silly fun. Brad Bird who directed the Pixar classics ""The Incredibles"" and ""Ratatouille"" has gone live-action for the first time. Working with the renowned cinematographer Robert Elswit Bird pushes his cast through as many preposterous scrapes as possible and at times he attains the freedom of animation with real flesh and crashing metal. He seems particularly obsessed with falling or the fear of falling Tom Cruise scales the worlds tallest building (the spindly Burj Khalifa in Dubai) gripping with electronic gecko gloves one of which appears to have a dying battery. Cruise runs a lot which is just as well since hes now so tensed and will-driven as an actor that no one can write a real part for him. The plot is trivial the world is in danger of being destroyed by a ""nuclear extremist"" (as opposed to a ""nuclear moderate""?). Cruise has to stop him. See the movie on an IMAX screen if you can--the induced vertigo is exciting though you may feel that youre holding your stomach in your hands.

Comments (6) click to enlarge Mission Impossible--Ghost Protocol Rated PG-13  133 minutes  2011 The Mission Impossible franchise is easy to dismiss as Tom Cruises zillion-dollar plaything but he deserves some credit for handing each installment over to a noted director with a clear stylistic signature (Brian De Palma John Woo J.J. Abrams) instead of the invisible hack you might expect. Number four goes to Brad Bird making his live-action debut after a pair of successful animation features (The Incredibles Ratatouille) and there are some wonderfully cartoonish moments particularly the skyscraper stunts and a Road Runner-worthy sequence involving a giant screen that replicates the vanishing point of an empty hallway even as the secret agents behind it move progressively closer. As usual with the series the movie combines a plot line a toddler could understand with gadgets that would baffle an engineering Ph.D. With Paula Patton Jeremy Renner and Simon Pegg in the comic tech-geek role.

But since Tom Cruise is the producer (and star) of this fourth feature-film spinoff of the 60s TV series we can assume that he wanted to assert his limber muscularity as he approaches 50. So here he is using gluey gloves to climb the glass facade of Dubais Burj Khalifa the worlds tallest building until he is 123 floors above certain death. This reckless bravado which must have tested the nerves of the movies insurers as much as it did Cruises means to demonstrate the macho masochism -- the machochism if you will or masochismo -- of a true action star as if he were the Douglas Fairbanks or Jackie Chan of todays Hollywood. It could also be Cruises way of proving to himself and his audience that he can still scale any heights in an Arab emirate or at the worldwide box office. And this not the live-action directorial debut of Pixars Brad Bird or todays sneaky five-day pre-release on 400 IMAX screens is the real news of MI 4 -- the movies own subtextual cliffhanger. (READ Corliss review of the last Mission Impossible movie) A bright comer in Taps released 30 years ago this month Cruise seized stardom by the cojones with his daredevil smile cool shades and underpants dance in the 1983 Risky Business a savvy proto-John Hughes teen comedy that was made for 6 million and earned 63.5 million in North American theaters -- about 170 million in current dollars. His flyboy film Top Gun grossed the 1986 equivalent of 380 million (about the same as the Harry Potter finale made this year); and in 1988 Rain Man pulled in what would be 340 million today. Behind the Pepsodent grin audiences saw Cruises steely determination to excel that unusual amalgam stoked a quarter-century of star power. By the time of Rain Man the kid was 26 and not cruising but cresting. A Few Good Men Interview With the Vampire Jerry Maguire and the first Mission Impossible propelled him through the 90s; two MI sequels and a couple of Spielberg epics -- Minority Report (probably Cruises smartest action film) and War of the Worlds -- kept his streak alive into this century. Even the lamoid Vanilla Sky earned 100 million a decade ago. Note that many of Cruises films from his prime period were not straightforward action adventures but tough dramas like Oliver Stones Vietnam bio-pic Born on the Fourth of July (70 million then 135 million today) to which Cruise attracted his huge and faithful fan base. (READ Corliss review of Minority Report a TIME 10-Best film of 2002) But gravity and shifting winds exert no less a pull on the loftiest stars than on a dude clinging to a Dubai skyscraper. Cruise took a hit for his public declarations of fealty to the ""Church"" of Scientology (a stigma that John Travolta another Scientology proselytizer somehow avoided). And his love sonnets to Katie Holmes frantically declaimed to an unbelieving Oprah led some people to think he was to use the clinical term nuts. Maybe the public fell out of love with him; a lot of marriages end in the husbands mid-40s. Whatever the reason no movie in which Cruise starred has reached even the devalued 100-million mark at the domestic box office since MI 3 in 2005. After disappointing the American audience with his World War II drama Valkyrie and the spy caper Knight amp; Day (though both films did solid business abroad) he must have figured he needed to return as Ethan Hunt in another episode of the 15-year-old Impossible franchise to be Tom Cruise again. (READ Corliss take on Tom Cruises Oprah meltdown) In the jerry-or-Tom-built script by Josh Appelbaum and Andre Nemec the mad-genius scientist Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist) is bent on acquiring Russian nuclear launch codes and Ethan infiltrates the Kremlin to stop him. Oops it explodes into rubble about 30 years too late to satisfy the Reagan hawks. (""Mr. Gorbachev blow up that building"") ""Ghost protocol"" is invoked meaning the the Mission team is cut off from all U.S. government support. The gang has been reduced possibly by federal cuts during the Recession from the TV shows six members to a bare-bones four Ethan uber-nerd Benji (Simon Pegg) lithe looker Jane (Paula Patton) and mysterious analyst Brandt (Jeremy Renner). But they must have a lavish stash that finances their globe-hopping from Budapest to Moscow to the exotic ""Bai"" twins Du- and Mum-. Maybe this branch of the Impossible Mission Force swung a loan from the International Monetary Fund -- the other IMF. (SEE TIMEs choices for the 10 Best Movies of 2011) Bird who directed the feature cartoon The Iron Giant and helped create the visual style of The Simpsons before making The Incredibles and Ratatouille at Pixar keeps things hopping as energetically as Cruise on Oprahs couch. The opening chase and killing of a U.S. agent Ethans breakout from a Russian prison and the whole Dubai sequence which includes much Cruise dangling a chase in a blinding sandstorm and Pattons nifty girlfight with sexy counterspy Lea Seydoux are expertly choreographed. The director also contributed some clever gadgets which may have ben left over from the accoutrements he devised for the family of superheroes in The Incredibles. But Birds knowing verve cant camouflage the downtime between action scenes. Two Russian characters a prisoner and a cop receive a lot of exposition time considering their minor involvement in the plots payoff. Ethans climactic tussle with Hendricks should be no-contest but the mad scientist apparently had spare time to do a lot of reps hes surprisingly athletic. (Hendricks should have had a goon sidekick to even the odds against our hero.) And even the climbing of the Burj Khalifa isnt quite enthralling enough to distract the viewer from two musings 1. Wouldnt hotel security or ordinary folks photographing this Mideast miracle have noticed that Tom Cruise was crawling up the side? And 2. In a Dubai visit that consumes about a half-hour of screen time couldnt the writers have introduced at least one Arab character? (READ Why Paramount ended its long relationship with Tom Cruise) For his subordinates on the Mission team Cruise has imported actors from Indieland Pegg (Shaun of the Dead) and Philip Seymour Hoffman (Capote) for MI 3 and for this installment Patton and Renner whose respective low-budget films Precious and The Hurt Locker battled for Best Picture two years ago. The smart lithe and sexy Patton should get larger roles in finer movies; audiences would happily dive out of a highrise to see her. Renner though is saddled with the role of a brooding cipher. His big speech carries zero emotional resonance; its dead air stalls the Act Three momentum. Nyqvist is another art-house favorite in the Swedish Girl With the Dragon Tattoo film trilogy he was the crusading journalist to the wily hacker played by Noomi Rapace -- also making her Hollywood-backed action-film debut today in the Sherlock Holmes sequel. Producer Cruise leaves the heavy flexing to leading-man Cruise and he comfortably embodies an action hero who is superefficient but no superman (though at the Burj Khalfia he does a passable Spider-Man impression). Audiences may have forgiven or forgotten the stars transgressions and might be ready to welcome him back in the coin of the realm any movie poobah understands. Its just a shame Cruises comeback vehicle doesnt ride more smoothly over the narrative terrain. And yes Im thinking it so I might as well say it Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol is no Fast Five.

Artificial slope to open at Buck Hill this fall next Movies 135671778 Fourth Mission Impossible folds humor into the action By COLIN COVERT December 15 2011 -- 344pm David James Paramount Pictures Jeremy Renner and Tom Cruise in ""Mission Impossible 4 Ghost Protocol"" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint The fourth ""Mission Impossible"" outing has a much lighter tone thanks to Pixar animation ace Brad Bird the studios first director to tackle live action. His fresh touch gives breathless energy tremendous excitement and above all humor to what could have been a wearying genre exercise. The plot may be perfunctory (again with the stolen nuclear-launch codes?) but Bird has choreographed some of the most remarkable stunt scenes ever committed to film. Hanging Tom Cruise from the towering Burj Khalifa isnt the half of it. Much thought has gone into revitalizing obligatory scenes like car chases with tense witty twists involving Dubai sandstorms and Mumbai gridlock. The acting isnt deep but Cruise regains some of his star luster as superspy Ethan Hunt. His battles unfold with brutal grace and cleverness. Simon Pegg operates an array of wacky gadgets from antigravity underwear to a portable mirage projector that is the best iPad app ever. This film isnt concerned with creating an air of heart- attack urgency -- its opening set piece a prison riot in Moscow is scored to Dean Martins breezy ""Aint That a Kick in the Head?"" -- but for jovial escapism its right on target. The movie opens Friday in limited release at Imax theaters. A full review will run Wednesday on its wide release date. Read an interview with director Bird at startribune.com/movies.

Its a rousing gasp machine that gives the flagging franchise the kick in the pants it sorely needed and it marks the most impressive segue from cartoons to features since ""Pee-Wees Big Adventure."" One of the films first on-screen credits proclaims that were watching ""A TOM CRUISE PRODUCTION"" but Cruise himself seems hip to the fact that audiences these days prefer him (a) in small doses and (b) not trying so damn hard to charm us all the time. Subsequently ""Ghost Protocol"" (written by ""Alias"" vets Josh Appelbaum and Andre Nemec) not only gives us a brooding Agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise) now estranged from his wife under mysterious circumstances but also honors the original ""Mission Impossible"" by letting Hunts teammates share in the heavy lifting. We meet Jane (Paula Patton) in Moscow where she and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg whose IMF technician character from ""MI III"" has been promoted to field agent) are springing Ethan from prison -- hes been there for an unspecified period of time after murdering six Croatian agents. Jane and Benji are still reeling from the death of Hanaway (Josh Holloway) their comrade who was shot by a slinky assassin in the process of intercepting some Russian missile launch codes. Those codes are headed to Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist who played the journalist in the original Swedish ""Millennium Trilogy"" movies) an unhinged diplomat who thinks a little nuclear war is just the thing to send mankind toward the next step in its evolution. Complicating matters is the fact that Hendricks has caused a major international incident -- lets just say he blows up the wrong building -- and made it look it Hunt and his team were responsible. Disavowed by the government the three of them along with IMF desk jockey Brandt (Jeremy Renner) must go on a globetrotting mission to save the world. ""Mission Impossible -- Ghost Protocol"" isnt the kind of movie thats going to inspire a lot of arguments about plot or character obviously but it delivers the jolts and the thrills non-stop. Its become something of a given in this series that were going to see Cruise hanging off some dizzily high structure with one hand -- this time its Dubais Khalifa Tower the tallest building in the world -- but Bird gets to put his own spin on things as well. The directors background in animation matches the material perfectly from a high-tech hallway cloaking device that calls to mind Bugs Bunny painting a fake train tunnel on a wall to the tangibility of the computer-generated effects here. The CG fakery of movies like ""Hugo"" and ""Sherlock Holmes A Game of Shadows"" lacks a certain gravity but when a car plummets to earth two feet behind Ethan I jumped back in my seat. Its Birds skill that makes the difference between perceiving an effect as a real object versus attempting to fake out the audience with what comes off as a mass of ones and zeroes. Perhaps the films greatest accomplishment is making audiences care about the ""Mission Impossible"" franchise again. Between the Bourne movies and the ""Fast and the Furious"" saga not many moviegoers spent the last five years longing for the return of Hunt and the IMF team; with Bird at the helm however this series rockets back into relevance. ""Mission Impossible -- Ghost Protocol"" features at most two or three laggy bits during its running time (along with far too many ""brought to you by BMW"" product placement moments) but it feels like nit-picking even to mention them. Blurb-hungry pundits will unpack their usual adjectives (""Its a pulse-pounding thrill ride that will blow you through the back of the theater until your spine shatters into the popcorn machine with sheer exhilaration"") but for once the hyperbole is earned. Brad Bird could teach Michael Bay and his acolytes a thing or two about telling a narratively and visually cohesive story without sacrificing any excitement. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

The camera moves up and tilts downward in a smooth unbroken shot so that we can all know that the actor is really standing there. By now were more than ready for that shot (its become fairly ho-hum). But theres no way that I was ready for the extraordinary dread-inducing Look Ma no safety net sequence in Mission Impossible -- Ghost Protocol where Tom Cruise makes his way across the surface of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai -- the worlds tallest skyscraper -- while clinging to the buildings glass panels with a pair of electrified adhesive gloves. Cruise as IMF agent Ethan Hunt is trying to break into the suite that houses the skyscrapers computer servers and this is the only way he can do it without being detected from within. Brad Bird the director of Ghost Protocol knows all too well that the audience will be on the lookout for any tell-tale cut any obvious digital image anything at all that reveals that Tom Cruise isnt really on the side of that skyscraper. And damned if we can find one This is a sequence so ingeniously conceived and shot that even the audience doesnt want to look down -- a sequence so death-defying that it gets you laughing at your own susceptibility (especially if like me you happen to have a fear of heights). Shimmying up and down and around the buildings surface with the ground looking as if it must be a mile below Cruise becomes a fearless human bug (think Spider-Man without the superpowers). Then just as were sure that our hearts couldnt dig any deeper into our throats one of his gloves begins to short out and lose adhesive power. Dont you hate when that happens? Ghost Protocol brims with scenes that are exciting and amazing at the same time; theyre brought off with such casual aplomb that theyre funny too. Early on Hunt and a fellow agent the nattering tech nerd Benji (Simon Pegg) have to penetrate the archive room of the Kremlin and they do it in captivating silence by hiding behind a scrim that projects to the security guard an exact image of the hallway theyre in (minus the two of them). Its the spy equivalent of a magic trick and thats the spirit of the whole movie. Ghost Protocol is fast and explosive but its also a supremely clever sleight-of-hand thriller. Brad Bird the animation wizard (The Incredibles The Iron Giant) makes the leap to live action with the kind of skill Paul Greengrass brought to the Bourne films only Bird showing an animators miraculously precise use of visual space has a playful screw-tightening ingenuity all his own. After an epic explosion rocks the Kremlin the entire IMF gets ""disavowed"" and Hunt and his team find themselves cut off without backup. Suddenly theyre rogue agents like an espionage version of the Oceans gang only with far more important priorities. Their mission is to stop Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist dour costar of the Swedish Girl With the Dragon Tattoo films) a lone terrorist who has stolen the Russian nuclear codes from launching a missile and kicking off a nuclear war. All because hes a nihilist nut who really wants to. Hunts team aside from Benji (played by Pegg with impish timing) includes the terrific Paula Patton as the dangerously beautiful and ruthless Jane and Jeremy Renner all moody reticence as a desk jockey named Brandt with a backstory that makes it look for a time like hes Ethans ambiguous adversary. Together these four execute fake seductions and underworld meetings take parking-garage fight scenes to new heights of layer-cake suspense and race against the clock of a nuclear countdown thats just jittery enough to make the unthinkable credible. Its become easy to take Tom Cruises skill for granted (even his fans do) but in Ghost Protocol he has a pulsating presence a dynamic mind-body fusion. From the moment he gets broken out of a Russian prison cell only to argue with Benji via video feed as chaotic violence swirls all around him Cruise energizes the film with his no-sweat bravura. He kicks ass like an Ultimate-Fighting bruiser he races vehicles like a demon -- but more than any of that he invests every line every situation with the cleanly intense fired-up concentration of an actor who means it. Powered by Cruises moxie Mission Impossible -- Ghost Protocol proves that in a Hollywood action-ride culture drenched in fake adrenaline its cathartic to encounter the real thing.

By Peter Rainer Film critic December 16 2011 Save for later Saved Tom Cruise reprises his role as Ethan Hunt in a scene from Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol. Paramount Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of ""Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol"" the latest installment in the 16-year-old series is one of the best. It marks the live-action debut of director Brad Bird the highly imaginative mind behind those animated marvels ""Iron Giant"" ""The Incredibles"" and ""Ratatouille."" He makes the transition smoothly perhaps because so many of the highflying stunts in this film are essentially out of ""The Incredibles"" playbook. The movie although it will be available in standard formats is best enjoyed in IMAX where the big death-defying hijinx and the panoramas of places like Dubai United Arab Emirates are literally eye-popping.Tom Cruise is of course back as Ethan Hunt who we first see breaking out of a Russian prison with the help of Simon Peggs computer whiz Benji Dunn another holdover from the previous escapade. Soon joining in are no-nonsense Jane Carter (Paula Patton) and agent William Brandt (Jeremy Renner). When a secret mission inside the Kremlin goes terribly wrong and part of the edifice is blown away the IMF team is declared ""ghost protocol"" by the US president - i.e. theyre on their own.Even without any official backup the impossibilists have a ready arsenal of space-age hardware at their disposal. Theyll need it. They are attempting after all to bring down a mad genius (Michael Nyqvist) who wants to reboot the world by triggering a nuclear winter. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? The films centerpiece stunt is Ethans clinging with suction gloves to the side of Dubais tallest building 123 stories up. Cruise reportedly did his own stunt work. If so I can only imagine what the insurance on this film cost. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Some of the action gets repetitive and the Mumbai sequences would have been better if Mumbai and not just the interiors of a zillionaires fancy hotel had been utilized. But ""Ghost Protocol"" is a very good thrill ride and Cruise is better than hes been in a long time. Despite all the calisthenics he seems relaxed - even while dangling sky high.

We last saw Impossible Mission Forces agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) all but walking into the sunset with new wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan). Now? Hes locked up in a Russian prison and shes nowhere to be found. In no time Ethan is retrieved by IMF colleagues Jane Carter (Paula Patton) and newly promoted field agent Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg similarly promoted from the ranks of comic relief) and enlisted to help prevent a nuclear physicist code-named Cobalt (Michael Nyqvist of the original Dragon Tattoo films) from launching a couple of warheads in a planet-scorching plot worthy of a Bond film. However things go awry quite quickly for the team as Cobalt frames them for a bombing at the Kremlin and the U.S. government consequently disavows the entire IMF agency -- meaning that our three agents along with intelligence analyst William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) are armed only with limited supplies and no support in their efforts to avert worldwide destruction. But for all the future tech that remains at their disposal the gadgets often proceed to malfunction with the first indication coming as a message that will self-destruct fails to do so. This sets the tone for the just-out-of-reach antics that Alias vets Josh Appelbaum and Andre Nemec have scripted for Hunt and the gang to conquer. The vaguely smirking villain and his devious plot are straight out of the Cold War though divorced from that eras pervasive paranoia (to which this months Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy helped itself) and a sprightlier sense of humor crops up nicely throughout without being doled out exclusively by Pegg as it often was in MI-3. Obstacles aside he Cruise Patton and Renner play off one another well between united feats of aligned purpose and individual prowess; perhaps more than in any other entry no one member of the team feels any less vital than the others. The real accomplishments tend to come from the team behind the camera with Birds boy-and-his-toys ingenuity defining action sequences that are then executed with the confidence of a veteran. Whats more (literally) is the use of IMAX cameras for the action sequences rivaling Christopher Nolans work on The Dark Knight for sheer scope and immersion with the footage smoothly integrated into the film by way of an expanding frame (as opposed to the somewhat jarring shifts of Nolans footage though fitting for that relative bruiser of a blockbuster). The technique really shines in the staggering Dubai-set centerpiece an already breathless union of con game car chases foot chases and good old-fashioned derring-do in outside of and around the towering Burj Khalifa skyscraper that is made all the more vertigo-inducing by the format for a solid 20 minutes. Its an applause-earning show-stopper that outdoes the excellent bridge battle from the previous film and inevitably serves as a peak of sorts the momentum from which carries the rest of this entry through to its hasty conclusion. Every pummeling and pursuit is shot and cut for maximum clarity throughout by Robert Elswit and Paul Hirsch respectively. A common thread between Bird and former series director/current producer J.J. Abrams composer Michael Giacchino delivers another rousing score that leaps forth from the classic themes of the show to define itself in rightfully thrilling ways. Only one scenario involving magnetic levitation tests the tethers of suspended disbelief evoking the first films iconic man-on-a-string antics without any of the string or nearly as much tension. Hunts ultimate showdown with Cobalt echoes that of Goldfinger and while it would appear counterproductive for this franchise to fashion itself after another spy series it happens to be modeling itself on Bond adventures the likes of which arent really made anymore. Just as newly gritty heroes seem to have run their course (fingers crossed) Cruise and Bird are doing their damnedest to maintain the escapist thrills that we as audiences will always choose to accept.

It turns out to be rousing good news that producer-star Tom Cruise has brought on Brad Bird the animator king behind The Incredibles Ratatouille and The Iron Giant to make his live-action directing debut with the fourth Mission Impossible movie. In fact Bird is an ideal fit to follow Brian De Palma in 1996 John Woo in 2000 and J.J. Abrams in 2006. For Bird the impossible is business as usual and his is the best and most spectacular Mission yet. See it in IMAX and youre in for an action adrenaline rush that keeps you on the edge of your seat eager for the next visual astonishment. The IMAX cameras produce the thrilling effect of 3-D without the damn glasses making Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol a genuine marvel of cinema ingenuity. Check the dizzying scene of Cruise scaling Dubais Burj Khalifa the worlds tallest building. You wont believe your eyes. More News Sundance 2015 Stars Answer Peter Travers Burning Question 10 Best Movies of 2014 All Stories >> And Bird turns out to be a natural with flesh-and-blood actors tapping the script by Josh Appelbaum and Andre Nemec for every ounce of humor and suspense. Bird also knows how to build a scene for utmost impact. And he has just the right actors to do him proud. Cruise effortlessly exudes magnetism as Ethan Hunt the IMF (Impossible Mission Force) undercover agent who specializes in getting out of tight fixes. Bird starts things off on a high with Ethan busting out of a Moscow prison with outside tech assistance from Benji Dunn (a wonderfully droll Simon Pegg) and Dean Martin warbling ""Aint That a Kick in the Head"" on the soundtrack. After a bomb blows up the Kremlin (another knockout IMAX sequence) Ethans boss (the great Tom Wilkinson) tells him the President has evoked ""ghost protocol"" to sever the U.S. from the team leaving Ethan Benji Jane Carter (Paula Patton) and new agent William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) out in the cold and without cash for fancy tricks. Unless of course they they can nab nuclear launch codes from a baddie (Michael Nyqvist) and restore order. This will require Ethan to hang by suction gloves from the 123rd floor of the Burj Khalifa in the face of a sandstorm. It also means double teaming two groups of crooks at the same time forcing Jane to duke it out with a hottie French assassin (Lea Seydoux) while Ethan dodges disaster. Its implausible as hell but no less fun for that. As Lalo Schifrins iconic TV theme keeps pumping cinematographer Robert Elswit and editor Paul Hirsch perform kinetic wonders as the film moves to Mumbai for a bruising face-off in a multi-leveled parking lot. Spotting a glammed-up Jane William cant disguise his envy. ""Next time I want to seduce the rich guy"" he says with Renner nailing the smile in the line. Sweet. Still this is Cruises show and the actor pushing 50 brings the role a startling athletic grace and becoming maturity. If someone asks you what a true movie star is point to Cruise. He has it all. And hes found an ideal collaborator in Bird. You leave Mission Impossible-Ghost Protocol thinking that these guys can do anything.

"Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; mission-impossible-ghost-protocol ) Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol (United States 2011) December 16 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Ghost Protocol is the fourth big screen Mission Impossible movie and the closest the 15-year old franchise has gotten to being an unofficial James Bond adventure. Globe-trotting and action-saturated the movie offers everything a good 007 yarn should have - eye-popping stunts explosions to make Michael Bays mouth water high speed chases and a megalomaniac villain with a deadly sidekick - although Tom Cruise exudes grunge more than the suave sophistication one expects from Bond. Ghost Protocol is pretty much wall-to-wall action to the point where it can be argued theres too much of it. At 133 minutes its at least a half-hour too long and the third act (in Mumbai) has an anticlimactic feel after the spectacular segments in Moscow and Dubai. The film reaches its pinnacle (both literally and figuratively) around the 70-minute mark and has trouble maintaining momentum after that. The basic storyline is fairly straightforward; no one is going to confuse this with Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. Veteran IMF agent Ethan Hunt and his team are hunting down the Swedish-born international terrorist Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist) a nutcase with a 190 IQ whos interested in gaining control of a few nuclear weapons. Their mission should they accept it is to keep Hendricks from achieving his goal which would result in MAD becoming real some two decades after the end of the Cold War. Hendricks and his thuggish henchman Wistrom (Samuli Edelmann) are nasty pieces of work who kill without compunction and dont blink at the thought of firing the first shot in a war that will obliterate billions. (Hendricks seems to think that the only way to true peace is through nuclear annihilation.) Hunts team consists of four agents (including himself). Theres Benji (Simon Pegg) the Q-like computer whiz whos returning from installment 3; Brandt (Jeremy Renner) the analyst with some field agent training; and Jane (Paula Patton) who adds a dose of estrogen to an otherwise testosterone-laden production. Of course this is really all about Hunt/Cruise who gets the best lines and the most daring stunts. Once Hendricks blows up the Kremlin and frames IMF the President exercises the ""ghost protocol"" and ""disavows"" the group. They still have their mission but now theyre doing it off the grid without external support. Hendricks trail takes them from Moscow to Dubai to Mumbai where the final confrontation occurs. Ghost Protocol is 90 minutes of a fantastic movie and 45 minutes of an unremarkable one. The problem is one of structure once the filmmakers have blown up the Kremlin and provoked Hunt to scale the worlds tallest building in the advent of an approaching sandstorm whats left? The Mumbai portion of the film as it turns out is less ambitious with a climax in a futuristic parking garage that seems more like a video game level than a motion picture sequence. (Its an exercise in literal platforming.) Still director Brad Bird making his live action debut after helming two of the best mainstream animated films of the last 20 years (The Iron Giant and The Incredibles) buys so much good will during the movies first two-thirds that exhausted though we may be we stick with him to the end. Ghost Protocol is big and brassy doing many of the things its predecessors did but in the words of Nigel Tufnel turning them up to ""11."" It was made with the big-screen format of IMAX in mind (in fact its getting a one-week exclusive run in IMAX venues before its regular opening). Theres nothing understated about any aspect of Ghost Protocol. Exposition and character-building moments are shoehorned in without impacting the pace. The cinematography is bold without becoming confusing or distracting with grand sweeping helicopter shots and rock-steady depictions of ground action. The CGI is seamless - its difficult to intuit whether a computer was involved during the vertiginous Burj Khalifa sequence (the producers say ""no""). And Michael Giacchinos score is one of the best of the year mixing new material with the iconic ""Mission Impossible"" theme. One open question is whether this is Tom Cruises final outing as Hunt. In the past he has never rushed back to play the role (the average gap between movies is about five years) but this has always been a reliable franchise for Cruise to return to. By introducing the Hunt-like character of Brandt the series now has a Cruise replacement in waiting. Should the star curtail his participation in a potential Mission Impossible 5 Jeremy Renner will be ready to step in. Based on his limited action-oriented exposure in Ghost Protocol Renner is ready. Paula Patton provides the requisite sex appeal although her character gets a tragic backstory to accompany the high kicking girlfight in which she displays her athleticism. Simon Pegg one of the few returning cast members from an earlier Mission Impossible film is the comic relief. With its mix of old fashioned action sequences and super-modern technology Ghost Protocol is relentless in its pursuit of high octane thrills and suspense. The movie concentrates so hard on its set pieces that the storyline often feels insignificant and at times is easily forgotten. During the memorable sequence when Hunt is clambering like Spider-Man up glass windows more than 1000 feet from the ground no one is thinking about why hes doing it. It doesnt matter that it takes a ridiculous contrivance to get him out there. Its all about being in the moment and enjoying the rush. Ghost Protocol as a whole is like that - at least until it runs a little too long and we start wondering when its all going to wrap up and whether it will do so with a bang or a whimper.

Starring Tom Cruise and Paula Patton. (PG-13. 131 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) When it comes to ""Mission Impossible"" viewers have certain die-hard expectations. One We must hear a few bars of Lalo Schifrins iconic theme. Two The IMF team must receive orders that self-destruct in five seconds - no longer no less. Three Someone I dont care whom must peel off a stunningly lifelike latex mask from the chin up. And four At some point in the proceedings the audience must be totally and hopelessly confused. Related Stories Review Cruise and company get Mission just right Latest Mission  Impossible lives up to hype Review Mission Impossible -- Ghost Protocol ""Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" succeeds on most counts in this fourth gleeful effort in the franchise. It presses all the right buttons at all the right moments and never forgets its reason for being to shove Tom Cruise - who once again plays Impossible Mission Forces Ethan Hunt - into a goofy Russian generals costume. These movies have always been showcases for Cruises stardom and his ability to outrun special effects but a curious thing happens with ""Ghost Protocol"" It isnt about him or his shirtless vanity shots. Its all about the chase - an enjoyably loopy race against time as an evil ""nuclear extremist"" (Michael Nyqvist) schemes to launch Russian missiles against the United States thus sparking global apocalypse and cleansing the Earth of rot. His first big move is to bomb the crap out of the Kremlin and then pitch blame on the IMF. On the case - but off the books as ""ghosts"" - are Ethan and company who now include Benji (Simon Pegg) Jane (Paula Patton) and Brandt (Jeremy Renner). ""Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" was directed by Brad Bird (""The Incredibles"") whose first stab at a live-action feature preserves the buzzy exhilaration and carefree absurdity of a cartoon. The place where ""Ghost Protocol"" gets truly confusing is back inside the building where our IMF heroes are pulling off a multilayered bit of ""I Spy"" trickery that seems about 19 times more complicated than ""Inception."" But thats OK. Its all an excuse for things to go horribly wrong. If you widen your eyes and turn off your brain it all adds up to cracking good fun. The Imax incarnation blows up the eye candy - the panoramic sweeps of Budapest then Moscow then Dubai - and the volume which youll feel in your teeth. I actually think the vibrations may have dislodged a filling. E-mail Amy Biancolli at datebookletterssfchronicle.com.

(AP Photo/Paramount Pictures Free Tom CruiseThe star of four ""Mission Impossible"" films (and countless variations on the hotshot scenario in ""Top Gun"") is a captive of the new reality that Hollywood makes most of its money overseas. As a producer of the ""MI"" franchise hes heavily invested in an international currency action movies. Character development slows the money machine.In ""Mission Impossible -- Ghost Protocol"" the actors loss is the producers gain. Its an export-quality vehicle with American muscle under the hood. The world-class mechanic is Brad Bird the Oscar-winning director of the animated ""Ratatouille"" and ""The Incredibles"" who applies the pacing and spatial freedom of a toon to a live-action thriller.The race through emerging media markets begins in Moscow where Yankee secret agent Ethan Hunt is in prison for settling a very personal score. Hes sprung by two new members of the Impossible Missions Force -- honeytrap Jane (Paula Patton) and comic-relief Benji (Simon Pegg) -- to infiltrate the Kremlin and stop a mad scientist (Michael Nyqvist) from stealing a nuclear detonator.But after a deadly snafu the entire IMF is disavowed by the feds. Hunts team joined by shadowy tag-along Brandt (Jeremy Renner) has to go rogue to buy the launch codes in Dubai and deactivate a killer satellite in Mumbai. Those are scenic locales and Bird makes the most of them. The high-wire deception in Dubai is enacted at the Burj Khalifa hotel the worlds tallest building and includes a car chase through a sandstorm. The mission in Mumbai involves Jane seducing a media mogul (Anil Kapoor) and Hunt battling a bad guy on the multilevel merry-go-round of a mechanized parking garage.Cruise as usual is unscathed in the middle of some spectacular stunts. He only stumbles near the finish line when he tries to tell the team ""You complete me."" As an actor hes out of practice but as a bulletproof action hero hes impressive on cruise control.

Photo David James IMF has been disbanded by presidential order after being blamed for a terrorist bombing that destroys the Kremlin. So do Ethan Hunt and the remaining members of his now-rogue spy team sit around worrying about their 401(k)s? Possibly they would in real life but not in ""Mission Impossible -- Ghost Protocol a largely successful attempt to reboot the moribund franchise that turns out to be probably the most entertaining installment since Brian De Palmas series opener from 15 years ago. Tom Cruises Ethan agreeably less preening than of yore defies the unseen presidents Ghost Protocol shutdown order launching an impossibly convoluted scheme to recapture stolen Russian nuclear launch codes before San Francisco becomes a pile of cinders. Or something like that. PHOTOS TOM CRUISE CLIMBS THE BURJ KHALIFA IN DUBAI Under the witty direction of animation genius Brad Bird (""The Incredibles) ""Ghost Protocol acknowledges the incomprehensibility of ""MI plots which have always been shaky scaffoldings on which to hang the spectacular action sequences that audiences actually pay to see. Bird has some real doozies up his sleeve but first he disarms the audience with a title sequence -- springing Ethan from a Russian prison -- that affectionately kids the series and even the 60s TV show from whence it sprang. This opening is so thoroughly over-the-top absurd that I wouldnt have been surprised if Val Kilmers character from the spy spoof ""Top Secret turned up as the quickly dispatched chief of IMF (alas its an unbilled Tom Wilkinson). The movies sense of humor extends to casting British funnyman Simon Pegg as the gadget-master of Ethans team whose inventions have a way of failing at the most inopportune moments. Like when Ethan is using his special gloves to climb what amounts to the worlds largest phallic symbol a 160-story hotel in Dubai to get to computer servers that somehow can only be accessed from outside the building. This truly spectacular stunt -- supposedly executed without the use of computer-generated imaging -- is needed as part of a preposterous scheme to obtain those launch codes by having IMF staff simultaneously pose as the purchasers and sellers of said codes. Well I said it was convoluted. Bird has also done a great job of staging an exciting chase in the mother of all Dubai dust storms. When the action moves to Mumbai for reasons I cant begin to explain Ethan and one of the generic bad guys battle for possession of the codes on a series of revolving car elevators. Great fun The director alas cant do much with a soggy coda that reaches for unearned poignancy by asking audiences to actually remember Ethans wife from the unfortunate ""Mission Impossible III. The film also wastes the coiled intensity of Jeremy Renner as the newest member of the IMF team with a none-too-compelling past. Bird does keep audiences guessing whether Renner is the only leading actor in Hollywood whos even shorter than Cruise. The team is rounded out by Paula Patton -- amusingly jumping from her role as a lesbian schoolteacher in the Oscar-winning ""Precious -- whose principal function here is to seduce an Indian mogul in pursuit of you guessed it. Codes. Except for a threat to Dumpster-dive without a shirt Cruise whos pushing 50 plays a more mature iteration of Ethan. But given the actors vanity and limited sense of humor it would probably be expecting too much for him to more directly acknowledge his advancing age the way Sean Connery did in his final James Bond film made when he was not much older than Cruise. Clocking in at well over two hours ""Mission Impossible -- Ghost Protocol overstays its welcome a bit but delivers the goods where it really matters.

Starring Tom Cruise Ving Rhames Jeremy Renner Lea Seydoux Director Brad Bird Running time 213 Release Opened Dec 16 2011  Editorial Review A franchise on Cruise controlBy Ann HornadayFriday Dec. 16 2011Hand it to Tom Cruise Even on the cusp of the creaky age of 50 he still manages to do his own stunts look studly in a suit and maintain perfect hair sweepage. All those talents come into play in ""Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" the fourth installment of Cruises behemoth of a franchise in which his IMF agent Ethan Hunt bears more similarity to a steroid-popping James Bond than the urbane super-spies of the long-lost television series. Having banished forever the reel-to-reel tapes and latex masks that distinguished that cozy Sunday-night ritual Cruise has turned the series over to concussive action and eye-popping set pieces designed to show himself off in the very best most masculine light. Narcissism is nothing new in Hollywood of course and it doesnt necessarily militate against entertainment value. ""Ghost Protocol"" which marks the live-action debut of Pixar director Brad Bird (""The Incredibles"" ""Ratatouille"") possesses the requisite number of expertly choreographed howd-they-do-that scenes as well as some terrific supporting performances from ""Mission Impossible"" veterans and newcomers. Simon Pegg returning from his ""MI"" debut in the last film provides a hugely welcome dose of lightness and comic relief as Benji a meek British computer nerd who in this installment has finally managed to score a gig in the field. Paula Patton and Jeremy Renner as new additions to Ethans team hit their marks with professionalism and physical competence with Renner in particular proving that hes ready to assume the central role in the ""MI"" franchise if and when Mr. Cruise finally hangs up his carabiners. For now though the audience is instructed to sit back and admire Cruises physical prowess which is put most notably on display in ""Ghost Protocols"" spectacular stunt-centerpiece in which Ethan must climb the outside windows of the Burj Khalifa tower in Dubai (the worlds tallest building) smash in a window replace a dingus in a computer server then swing back into his room - all with one hand tied behind his back at least figuratively when he loses one of his gecko-esque suction-cup gloves. (In traditional ""MI"" fashion this scene is set to one of several of the films ticking clocks.) Running jumping scaling glass walls driving random BMWs - Ethan can do it all and by extension so can Cruise a case of self flattery-by-proxy that as both the series and its lead actor ages has begun to take on the whiff of compensatory overkill. (From the looks of a quick Durer-esque sketch he pens on his palm Ethan is even an accomplished artist.) Rather than strain so mightily to remind viewers of his still-rock-hard abs and blue-steel stare Cruise is more than entitled to remind us that he can actually act. If the Burj Khalifa sequence is the showiest bauble in ""Ghost Protocols"" bag of tricks a far craftier and satisfying episode precedes it when Cruise convincingly plays Ethan convincingly playing a Russian general and then engages a Kremlin guard in some absurdly clever misdirection by way of a portable screen and rear projection. That piece of visual legerdemain as well as Ethans quarry - Russian nuclear launch codes - are about as retro as it gets in a movie that never hesitates to fall back on a digital cheat or gimmick. Indeed at the outset of ""Ghost Protocol"" Bird announces his intentions to flout credulity by having a character jump from a tall building into a giant mattress that he has just inflated from a thingamajig he conveniently (and barely perceptibly) tossed a moment before. Bonds own gadget-master Q has nothing on the technology available to Ethan and his team who even when theyre forced to go rogue - after their infiltration of the Kremlin goes wonky - seem to be able to access unlimited funds cool stuff and even a private jet. For a group traveling under the radar theyre awfully over the radar. Then again how better to schlep from Dubai to Mumbai? There Bird once again orchestrates a complicated piece of stagecraft this time a brutalizing showdown set in a moving multi-level parking garage. By now the frenetic action gargantuan scale and furious scurryings to save the world will have begun to take their toll - on the audience if not the protagonists who have managed barely to break a sweat. Theres a place in the movies for wish fulfillment no doubt including the wish for it all to be over.Contains sequences of intense action and violence Want to go? 0 Been there? 0 Rate it 0 Share Recently Reviewed Creative Control Eye in the Sky Hello My Name Is Doris KTown Cowboys Miracles from Heaven Remember The Bronze The Confirmation The Divergent Series Allegiant The Divergent Series Allegiant The IMAX Experience Embrace of The Serpent (El abrazo de la serpiente) Knight of Cups Top Mission Impossible - Ghost...

In his first live-action film Bird helms a powerful thrill ride that is simultaneously gritty and dazzling.The exotic locales lend an invigorating freshness with the most arresting visual sequences taking place in Mumbai Dubai and Moscow.The screenplay by Josh Appelbaum and Andre Nemec is crafted for maximum suspense. About the movieMission Impossible Ghost Protocol 1/2 out of fourStarsTom Cruise Paula Patton Jeremy Renner Simon Pegg Michael Nyqvist Director Brad BirdDistributor Paramount Pictures Rating PG-13 for sequences of intense action and violence Running time 2 hours 13 minutes Opens Friday in IMAX theaters and select citiesTom Cruise is in top form reprising his role as agent Ethan Hunt. The film opens with a well-orchestrated bang as Hunt busts out of a Russian prison to the accompaniment of Dean Martins Aint That a Kick in the Head. Assisting in Hunts breakout are a pair of agents on the outside tough Jane Carter (Paula Patton) and nerdy Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg).But the trio bungles a mission inside the Kremlin. A bomb goes off and their agency the Impossible Mission Force is implicated and shut down. Hunt and his team know the explosion is the work of madman Kurt Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist) whos hellbent on starting a nuclear war. But the U.S. president declares ""ghost protocol"" in which Hunt and his team must remain off the grid operating deeply undercover to clear the organizations name.A latecomer to the team is William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) an analyst with a mysterious past. This film is wisely more of an ensemble than a Cruise vehicle with the lead quartet working believably as a spy team. Pegg offers comic relief as Dunn Renner imbues Brandt with a keen intensity and Patton is terrific as an agent with a personal vendetta.The films power is ratcheted to new heights when Hunt scrambles up Dubais Burj Khalifa -- the worlds tallest tower -- assisted by ingenious suction gloves. This scene like the overall film is at its most thrilling on huge IMAX screens.After a glamorously cleaned-up Hunt and Carter wend their way through a lavish party tension peaks in a high-rise car park in Mumbai as Hunt and Hendricks stage a cat-and-mouse game. Ghost Protocol is the rare spy thriller/action film that employs a perfectly calibrated blend of high-voltage explosions intricate gadgetry and dizzying chases without sacrificing compelling characters.

Im Jumping Into An Oven? Credit Paramount Pictures From Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol - Pulling The Trigger Pulling The Trigger Credit Paramount Pictures As special effects become ever more computer-dependent and as digital animation becomes increasingly photo-realistic it was only a matter of time before a studio embraced the notion that the effects-heavy action flick is really just animation that exists in the real world. To that end the producers of Mission Impossible -- Ghost Protocol hired Brad Bird -- the Pixar director responsible for Ratatouille and The Incredibles -- to take on the fourth installment in the series; its his first attempt at making movies with people rather than pixels and its a gamble that pays off in one of the most expertly constructed and choreographed pure action films in recent memory. Bird is a director used to making movies without the pesky limitations of physics (and other minor annoyances) getting in the way. In animation both his ""camera"" and his characters can move wherever and however he chooses. Thats the philosophy that he brings as much as its possible to MI4 and he announces it early in a brilliantly coordinated sequence in which two operatives of the Impossible Mission Force -- Agents Carter (Paula Patton) and Dunn (Simon Pegg returning from MI3) -- break team leader Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) out of a Russian prison. Its a statement of purpose for the entire film smoothly shot gracefully orchestrated laced with an undercurrent of sly humor. The directors visual command is so expert that it doesnt even make a difference that the plot is a warmed up leftover from the back of the mid-80s fridge Hunt and his team must avert nuclear war between the U.S. and Russia. The threat originates with one man Kurt Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist) a mad and unfortunately one-note evil genius who gets his hands on Russian launch codes and the means to use them. Hendricks is only trying to help nudge the process of natural selection He believes a catastrophic nuclear event would result in a more highly evolved humanity. Once the fallout settles and the world becomes habitable again presumably. The story doesnt rely entirely on Cold War castoffs though as screenwriters Andre Nemec and Josh Appelbaum also fold in references to -- and digs at -- current U.S. anti-terrorism policy. An arms dealer articulates it quite plainly to Hunt midway through the film ""To your government a potential terrorist is a terrorist."" i Brandt (Jeremy Renner) and Jane (Paula Patton) -- both members of Hunts crew -- pull off a grand escape. David James/Paramount Pictures hide caption toggle caption David James/Paramount Pictures Brandt (Jeremy Renner) and Jane (Paula Patton) -- both members of Hunts crew -- pull off a grand escape. David James/Paramount Pictures In the moment the words strike home to our hero Implicated in a messy international incident he and his team have essentially been labeled terrorists and hung out to dry by their government. The titular ""ghost protocol"" cuts the IMF loose disavows their existence and leaves them out in the field without a lifeline. Much of their high-tech gadgetry no longer fully operates without central support which forces them to rely on wit and skill rather than whiz-bang technology. Hunts team expands to four with the addition of an intelligence analyst William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) whos thrust unwittingly into the middle of the fray. The four function well as an ensemble Cruise and Renner maintain a nice tension with their characters alternate strategic approaches; Patton is the all-purpose versatile utility player; and the expansion of Peggs minor role from comic-relief technician to full team member is a welcome one. It keeps the film from ever taking itself too seriously -- a signature pitfall of mediocre action movies. Bird also wisely sidesteps the knee-jerk tendency to make a big event movie in 3-D opting for IMAX as the better vehicle for visual spectacle. He shot about a quarter of the film with IMAX cameras and some of the films signature set pieces -- particularly a vertiginous 130-stories-high climb of the exterior of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai -- make some of the best use of the large format since The Dark Knight. MI4 may not be as smart as Birds Pixar work but thats not a deficiency here. This film exists purely to dazzle and thrill and by that measure it delivers expertly never lagging despite a lengthy 133-minute running time. Almost as exciting as the film itself though is how beautifully it showcases the evidence for a showmans argument that live-action filmmaking can rival animation when it comes to unlimited imagination.

"Mission Impossible-Ghost Protocol review Watch Brad Birds first live-action movie on the biggest screen you can find. Slate Sign In Sign Up Brad Bird Is Such a Great Director That He Even Makes Tom Cruise Non-Irritating Brad Bird Is Such a Great Director That He Even Makes Tom Cruise Non-Irritating Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 15 2011 517 PM Mission Impossible-Ghost Protocol Watch Brad Birds first live-action movie on the biggest screen you can find. By Dan Kois Tom Cruise climbs Dubais Burg Khalifa in in Mission Impossible-Ghost Protocol sTILL (c) 2011 Paramount Pictures. All rights reserved. In talking about this big big movie lets begin with the big big tower. Dubais Burj Khalifa is 160 stories tall and of course youve seen that shot in the trailer for Mission Impossible-Ghost Protocol (Paramount) where the camera flies over the tower its spire narrowing to a point while the city floats by far far below. Well let me just tell you that that shot--which in a 400-pixel window on your computer monitor looks like something youve seen a thousand times before--is awe-inspiring when viewed on a 72-foot-wide IMAX screen. So is the action sequence that follows it wherein Tom Cruise dangles from a 139th-floor window and runs along the side of the building like the Road Runner. Dan Kois Dan Kois is Slates culture editor and co-host of Mom and Dad Are Fighting and a contributing writer to the New York Times Magazine. He is writing a book called How to Be a Family. Along with many other things--a crackerjack action picture a smoothly operating product-endorsement machine a useful guide to the obscuring of Cruises annoying persona via millions of dollars of special effects--the fourth Mission Impossible movie also functions as a primer on how to use IMAX technology to immerse an audience. The scenes on the Burj gave me more vertigo than Vertigo. MI-GP is director Brad Birds first live-action film after a career spent making animation masterpieces (The Iron Giant Ratatouille The Incredibles). MI has always been an auteurist action series--the previous directors were Brian De Palma John Woo and J.J. Abrams--and its easy and fun to pluck out Birds stylistic and thematic obsessions amid the noisy gunplay of this fourth installment. Advertisement An appreciation for unfussy hyper-competence? Check--Ethan Hunts team is made up this time of uncertain newbies (played by Simon Pegg Paula Patton and Jeremy Renner) who draw strength from Hunts instinctive talents and preternatural calm. Theres even a nice gag in which Hunt exasperatedly thumps the device explaining his mission when it doesnt as promised self-destruct in five seconds. He does his job; is it too much to ask that everyone else do theirs? An embrace of the power of the group over the power of the individual? Check--Ethan tries going it alone but the movie is full of dazzling set pieces cutting from team member to team member as they work together to execute fiendishly complicated plans. Most of all though MI-GP is recognizably a Bird picture because it exhibits a control of action imagery--a mastery of bodies moving through space--that rivals any non-animated film Ive ever seen. I worried what would happen when Brad Bird micro-director could no longer control his characters movements and behaviors on a frame-by-frame level. I shouldnt have been concerned. Hes solved that problem by ignoring it treating his actors and stuntmen like so many vectors to be placed perfectly in the frame. To pick just one of a dozen inventive exciting scenes take a fight between Ethan Hunt and the films chief baddie rogue nuclear scientist Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist). The skirmish takes place in an automated parking garage in Mumbai. As the two wrestle for a suitcase containing basically the future of the world they leap from one moving platform to another crash atop sports cars swing from ramps and get caught underneath sedans. Its a balletic battle through vertical and horizontal space with humans as cartoon characters who just happen to bleed and break bones. The plots not that important honestly. The ""Ghost Protocol"" of the title is an official government disavowal of the Impossible Missions Force after theyre framed for a terrorist bombing in Moscow. So Hunt and his team fight evil on their own which makes for a nice trim cast compared to the bloated superteams of previous MI films. Pegg is funny Patton steely Renner funny and steely. The most enjoyable performance in the film is given by filmdoms reigning king of heroic self-regard Anil Kapoor last seen in Slumdog Millionaire--or more accurately last seen rushing the stage upon the occasion of Slumdog Millionaires Oscar win. As for Cruise hes a piece of meat expertly deployed. Only in a misguided coda with the surviving team members laughing around a table like at the end of a sitcom does Cruise manage to irritate. During the rest of the film thank goodness hes too grimly determined to save the world for any of his personality to shine through. Should you see Mission Impossible-Ghost Protocol? By all means and in the big big biggest theater you can find. Dont watch it on TV and for Gods sake dont download it to your phone. I recommend the LG IMAX Theater in Sydney Australia which is eight stories high but your local multiplex will do. Be prepared afterward to feel as if the outside world is just a little bit too small.

"Mission Impossible a Ghost Protocol review Cruise hits highs - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMission Impossible a Ghost Protocol review Cruise hits highsTom Cruises fearless Ethan Hunt continues to propel the Mission Impossible franchise with director Brad Bird doing a stylish job on Ghost Protocol.December 16 2011|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Jeremy Renner top and Tom Cruise star in ""Mission Impossible --... (David James / Paramount...)Theyve done without the number this time but anyone who cares knows that ""Mission Impossible a Ghost Protocol"" is really ""Mission Impossible 4"" the fourth time Tom Cruises intrepid Ethan Hunt has taken on the evildoers of the world. And the fourth time a different adventurous director has orchestrated the action. Brian De Palma John Woo and J.J. Abrams were the choices the first three times around and the selection here is the most unexpected yet Brad Bird making his live-action debut after directing three exceptional animated films ""Ratatouille"" ""The Incredibles"" and ""Iron Giant."" Bird has done a stylish and involving job here turning in an entertaining production thats got considerable visual flair especially in its action-heavy Imax sections. Many of ""Ghost Protocols"" key action sequences were filmed with that 65 mm camera. There are only 27 minutes of Imax footage in the film but every one of those minutes counts which is one reason why Paramount chose to open this film in Imax theaters Friday five days before its general release. For a film with these kinds of visuals it must have been an easy choice. Bird also brought a touch of playfulness to the proceedings in moments like a self-destructing phone booth that refuses to self destruct. If ""Ghost Protocol"" doesnt display as much individualism as Birds animated features that likely wasnt in the cards with a tent-pole series like this. What is in those cards is another unswerving performance by Cruise whose onscreen commitment to the role is key to making these two-fisted tales a not to mention lines like ""nobody leaves this hotel alive"" a believable. If Rhino the hamster in the animated ""Bolt"" ate danger for breakfast Hunt eats it for lunch and dinner too. Before the main course the film opens with an appetizer involving a fellow agent from the Impossible Mission Force organization (Josh Holloway) interacting with a sultry assassin played by Frances Lea Seydoux and a mighty important briefcase that everyone wants to get their hands on. That briefcase turns out to contain Russian nuclear launch codes that are coveted by brilliant madman Kurt Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist) a stone-cold nihilist who believes that the only way to save the world is to destroy it and who will stop at nothing a nothing a to put his plan into action. Hendricks code name Cobalt is so feared that an IMF team is dispatched to liberate Hunt from a Russian prison where undisclosed actions have landed him. Teammates include the tough-as-nails Jane Carter (Paula Patton a long way from ""Precious"") and not-as-funny-as-he-thinks techie Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg). Once out Hunt and his gang make their way into the Kremlin to gather vital information only to have things go horribly wrong. The Kremlin explodes in an excellent effects shot the IMF folks get the blame and the dread Ghost Protocol is invoked The United States government disavows the team (talk about ingratitude) and Hunt and company are left to their own resources to save the world. Those resources still include some nifty gizmos that have the air of James Bond about them. There is a large-scale invisibility shield (which comes in handy in the Kremlin) contact lenses that work like a computer screen and Gecko Gloves suitable for major climbs. As written by Josh Appelbaum and Andre Nemec whose credits include the ""Alias"" TV show ""Mission Impossible"" is essentially a series of elaborate action set pieces. There is exposition thrown in here and there especially after circumstances force policy wonk William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) to join the team but that is not the heart of the matter. All that action benefits greatly not only from Cruises presence but also his willingness and ability to do big chunks of his own stunt work. An action moment in Moscow which has Hunt escape from a fourth-story ledge via some elaborate maneuvers was the press material informs actually performed by the actor himself. And more is yet to come. For ""Missions"" action ends up taking the team to the city of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. Not just anywhere in Dubai but the Burj Khalifa a futuristic glass-walled tower that is currently the tallest building in the world. Naturally the plot calls for Hunt to climb the outside and its really Cruise we see in action in the neighborhood of the 130th floor about a third of a mile off the ground. This is high anxiety with a vengeance. kenneth.turanlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESNew Releases Tribeca makes three titles available early on...April 15 2012Box office Devil Inside bests Ghost ProtocolJanuary 9 2012Movie Projector Devil Inside to challenge Ghost...January 6 2012Movie attendance falls to 16-year lowJanuary 3 2012Its still music to Dan Wallins earsJanuary 1 2012MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesTom CruiseEntertainmentImaxCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/reviews/la-et-mission-impossible-20111216,0,5671807.story?track=rss",200,missionimpossible32,missionimpossible,latimes

More about Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol >> The Tom Cruise franchise about a crack team of special agents who save the world by performing impossibly impossible acts of deception detection and derring-do has become a kind of cartoon anyway. No one really believes that Cruises Ethan Hunt and his gang have inner lives or even outer lives beyond the machinations of the mission at hand. So why not give Cruise a funny mustache and make Simon Pegg (as Benji the goofball Brit) sport a slightly too big hat on his head? The two of them march into the Kremlin disguised as Russian Army brass in order to collect vital files and everything about their gaits their gazes and their gruff Russian accents smacks of Looney Tunes. Hunt is just a couple of brushstrokes away from being a Muscovite Yosemite Sam. So Ghost Protocol which opens Friday only in Imax theaters and then everywhere on Wednesday has a certain cartoonish vibe. Thats OK because Brad Birds brand of toonage (The Iron Giant The Incredibles Ratatouille) owes much to the rigors and traditions of live action not only in the way he references other films but also in his visual approach - sweeping swooping camera pans wide vistas jolting perspective. Though not quite as front-to-finish satisfying as J.J. Abrams Mission Impossible III Birds installment nonetheless rocks. And if you see it in the giant Imax format with the kazillion watts of digital surround sound it literally does so. Watch (and feel) the Kremlin go kaboom - hurling Hunt to the ground and then hurling him and his new IMF squad on a mad run through Dubai and Mumbai trying to thwart a nuclear extremist (Michael Nyqvist - Mikael Blomkvist of the Swedish-made Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and its sequels). (Important note IMF stands for Impossible Missions Force not International Monetary Fund. The special agents of that other IMF really have their work cut out for them.) The centerpiece set-piece of Ghost Protocol involves a complicated swap of launch codes for diamonds a fetching French assassin (Lea Seydoux) a Russian arms dealer (Samuli Edelmann) and tricky parallel meetings on adjoining floors of Burj Khalifa the tallest building in the world. For reasons too absurd to get into (or to understand) Hunt is required to scale multiple stories of the vertiginous glass skyscraper - clambering up the buildings reflective skin using high-tech suction-cup gloves and a look of grim determination. Its an amazing sequence - suspenseful cinematic outlandish hard to top. Which makes Birds mission for what follows - the chase through the sandstorm the vertical parking-lot game of musical cars the fancy hotel seduction scene involving the beautiful Paula Patton and a Mumbai playboy billionaire - rather daunting. Inevitably the pace and purpose flag. But Cruise is never less than game Pegg adds a wonky comic tomfoolery to the proceedings Jeremy Renner comes onboard as a State Department aide with lethal skills and lots of baggage and Patton is striking whether shes pitching woo in a backless gown or kickboxing that French femme fatale. (Yes cat fight) And pay attention to the subtitles in the early going when everybodys running around Moscow and the world looks like its heading for Armageddon. Theres a great and totally cartoon-y moment when Agent Hunt struggles to regain consciousness in a hospital ward. Mission Impossible - Cyrillic Protocol.

Is there a star as determined as Tom Cruise to show how hard he works? Is there one as desperate to show how hard hes working for us?Were now in an age of such control that smoothness and the illusion of ease have taken over the movies. Ryan Goslings performance in ""Drive encapsulates the vogue for a kind of touchless action-hero and all that he does the appeal of his grace and clenched jaw the erasure of sweat and strain. I love Gosling and the less archly styled Jason Statham. But Cruise is laughing at them. Cruise will clench his jaw until his teeth shatter - do you think he cares that he just had his man-braces removed? For a paying audience to watch him save the world hed have his entire mouth reconstructed. Silly me. I almost typed ""pretend to save the world but isnt that the difference between Cruise and everybody else? Theres no ""cut for him.We might have given up on Cruise. The runty cockiness the intense asexuality the general relentlessness the sprinting - lord the sprinting so passe. But Cruise hasnt given up on himself. ""Ghost Protocol is the fourth ""Mission Impossible in 15 years and his decision to keep making these ridiculous movies - this ones ""A Tom Cruise Production - doesnt feel desperate. It feels like a workout. For him. For us. For whoever on the set was responsible for saying ""Tom thats a union job or ""Mr. Cruise we have stuntmen to run along the surface of that skyscraper and fling themselves inside.But Cruise knows weve come to see him accomplish the absurd. Weve come to see him do the mission-impossible. We want to believe that thats him in that sandstorm chasing down a Russian guy with nuclear-bomb codes. Thats him leaping from the ledge of a building and onto a speeding delivery truck. Who else would it be? Cruise of course leaves nothing to chance. The cheap high point of these movies always involves someones false face being ripped off only to reveal another face. Conveniently the machine that molds and paints the masks malfunctions at a crucial point in ""Ghost Protocol meaning Cruise can revel in the glory of seeming to kick and chop his own way through another exercise routine - I mean ""scene.The director is Brad Bird the Pixar writer and director making the sort of blatantly box-office-oriented movie that the characters in his more dignified animated hits - ""The Incredibles and ""Ratatouille - might roll their eyes at. But ""Ghost Protocol is far from a disgrace. He handles his first time with flesh and broken bones with confidence and patience. I havent seen the script which is credited to Andre Nemec and Josh Appelbaum. But it appears that Bird has seen the previous three movies and demanded clarity from Nemec and Appelbaum who both wrote for the old ABC spy series ""Alias. Theyve transferred the absurdity of that show to this movie in a way thats heightened and easy to follow. Its not logic you want in a movie like this - somebody blows up the Kremlin somebodys a ""nuclear extremist somebody hovers above the blade of a giant fan and it takes nearly two hours for a man to notice that Paula Patton is extremely beautiful. What you want is navigability. You just have to understand why Cruises indestructible superagent Ethan Hunt and Hunts new team - Simon Pegg Jeremy Renner and Patton - are hopping from Moscow to Dubai to Mumbai (aside from global commercial domination of course) and we do. Birds guidelines for the plot appear to have been Can the parents who like my other movies stay with this one?In its way the movie has old-Hollywood elegance. The scope and sets are vast tall and cavernous but Bird scales down for spatial intimacy. There are speeding sedans and barreling foot chases but he doesnt rely on them. (The best passage in the movie features two men leaping the shifting levels of a sleek tower full of parked cars.) Bird seems to prefer the challenge of wringing comic suspense from a couple of actors some gadgets and a situation. Theres a lovely stressfully funny sequence in which Cruise and Pegg nudge a projected scrim down a corridor. Theres also a nifty one that requires Renner whos loose self-mocking and not going for too much to do the sort of hovering that Cruise has apparently outsourced to newcomers.Bird also really punches up the ensemble playing. I imagine one of the upsides of being the director of nonhuman beings is that youre trained to respond to characters as much as stars. ""Ghost Protocol is littered with Peggs throwaway lines and facial expressions. Vladimir Mashkov as a Russian intelligence agent has a good time failing to catch Hunt. Lea Seydoux is a killer assassin with a great sense of chic. Michael Nyquist goes from his virtuous part as Mikael Blomkvist in the Swedish version of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo to a charismatic Euro-baddie. And in Mumbai the Bollywood star Anil Kapoor makes a late bid as a randy moneybags to walk off with the film. But who is he kidding? No one steals anything from Tom Cruise.Cruises only true peer is Mel Gibson. But Gibson has always had a kind of terrifying lunacy. Whether hes playing Hamlet or his ""Lethal Weapon psychopath hes ready to die in a way that makes some psychological sense. Cruise never seems crazy. Theres nothing psychological about him. He just seems exasperated to discover that people think they can actually beat him. Villainy is an affront both to mankind and his ego.Over time all his talent has become secondary to his masochistic vanity. Hes the sort of messiah wholl nail himself to the cross. It should be pathetic but after all these years I still wear a Cruisifix close to my heart. This is a man who at this point could be phoning it in selling chocolate ice cream on billboards in a Paris metro station. He could be on QVC. He could be in ""New Years Eve. But watching him appear to risk his life about 25 times (for our salvation) youre forced to concede that the entire point of ""Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol is just how not in ""New Years Eve Tom Cruise is.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Like a Hindus rejuvenating bath in the Ganges a dip in the series serves to wash away perceived doubts about the stars enduring fame and clout.The sustained box office of the MI series must have something to do with its canny balance of the familiar and the new. Cruise is the through-line but each film has introduced its own gadgets feeding off contemporary tech--theres plenty of tablet-device fondling here while the corker is a concealing screen that beams a false image to the eye of the beholder--and a distinct new authorial identity. Brian de Palma set the series template; John Woo put his hysterically baroque signature on the second MI; and J.J. Abrams who helmed the grim bruising third is producer on this fourth directed by Brad Bird. The latest to be called up by Cruise Bird has previously directed hugely successful animated features (The Incredibles Ratatouille) and so freely embraces the ""impossible"" rather than staking his action in a world of physical limitations. (Bird was clearly influenced by de Palma whose passion for the hairs-breadth set piece drives this latest film which throttles from one nick-of-time snatched victory to the next.)As Ghost Protocol begins Cruises agent Ethan Hunt undercover in a Russian jail is busted out by IMF operatives (Simon Pegg and Paula Patton) for another mission. When this a routine Kremlin break-in (routine in MI terms--in the last installment the Vatican got its lock picked) puts the team under suspicion of terrorism the resulting international incident leads the American government to disavow the IMF. Hunt amp; Co. with the addition of a stranded desk-agent Brandt (Jeremy Renner) are forced to go it alone tracking a rogue ""specialist in nuclear end-game theory"" (Michael Nyqvist) whos busily acquiring launch codes with the intention of provoking an atomic apocalypse.About a half-hour of Ghost Protocol is IMAX-shot intended to be projected on screens the size of the USS Nimitz. Among these monumentally inflated scenes is the movies literal and figurative high point which has Cruise in Harold Lloyd fashion scaling the stratospheric upper reaches of the 163-story Burj Khalifa skyscraper over Dubais SimCity skyline. This and its follow-up an expressionistic nightmare of a chase through a malevolent red-hued sandstorm are virtuoso turns though largely the movies action relies on crosscutting between synchronized coordinated team execution.The contemporary action movie on this blockbuster scale more and more resembles the ESPN ""Play of the Week"" countdown one superhuman just-by-the-fingertips circus catch after the next. There is no denying that this can be exhilarating though when Ghost Protocol stoops to deal in emotional rather than physical expression--Brandts guilt about a previous in-the-field failure a mystery surrounding Hunts disappeared wife--the movie goes flaccid as if trapeze artists had paused in mid-air to emote.Inasmuch as Ghost Protocol contains a theme its locker-room stuff Theres no ""I"" in ""team"" etc. But no one is buying tickets for the message. If the MI films are immune to the tarnish on the Cruise brand its precisely because their spectacle requires us to be impressed by Ethan Hunt not to like him.
