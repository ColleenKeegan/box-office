Thurman is 37-year-old Rafi who starts dating 23-year-old David (Bryan Greenberg) without realising he has a connection to her therapist Lisa. The film strings out the build-up to the reveal by following Rafi and Davids unremarkable relationship step-by-step only warming to its comic theme when Lisa cottons on to their mutual connection. Streeps scenes are lightly amusing but the romance is less than compelling and sharp observations about relationships jostle for space with dull exposition. While the trailers push this as an age-gap comedy the 14-year difference between Rafi and David isnt the central theme in fact the problem is there is no central theme. With its diluted Meet The Parents-style strand running alongside the diary of a mundane relationship this is a collection of beefed-up subplots whose believable characters are let down by the narratives lack of direction.

Uma Thurman as the newly divorced Rafi Gardet sports angelic blond tresses that lead a complicated life of their own alternately curly smooth fluffy piled high hanging long intricately twisted or at times strangely droopy as if they could use a snack or a smoke. You wonder how she finds time to come up with all these styling options what with love therapy and a mysteriously glamorous career that involves standing around watching fashion shoots. It would take a strong performer to stand up against that hair and luckily ""Prime"" has one Meryl Streep as Rafis therapist Lisa Metzger. The cute premise here -- and yes it is pretty cute -- is that Rafis new younger boyfriend David (Bryan Greenberg) is actually Lisas son. Mother and son have different last names and Rafi lies about him in therapy (shes worried that Lisa will disapprove of his age -- 23 to her 37 -- so she ups it a few years). It takes much of the movie for everyone to recognize the connection with some funny complications along the way. Movie review Showtimes and trailer""Prime"" with Meryl Streep Uma Thurman Bryan Greenberg Jon Abrahams. Written and directed by Ben Younger. 105 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sexual content including dialogue and for language. Several theaters. Thurman and Greenberg make a likable couple though the real romance in the story seems to be between the camera and Thurmans cheekbones. But the movie really belongs to Streep. This revered dramatic actress is a top-notch comedian and ""Prime"" gives her many (though not nearly enough) moments to shine. When Lisa figures out that her precious son is dating this much-older divorced shiksa her slippery face registers wonderment horror and just a bit of amusement all at once -- the situation however dire is kind of funny. And once shes gotten her bearings her sessions with Rafi take on a new shading. As Rafi gushes about her fabulous new love Lisa interrupts her voice elaborately casual This young man -- does he pick up after himself? Is he polite? Younger who made the 2000 Ben Affleck drama ""Boiler Room"" keeps the story appealingly light though occasionally slipping into rom-com blandness. But Streep beaming in her horn-rimmed glasses and spouting platitudes like ""Focus on the now for now"" makes it all a treat. Watch ""Prime"" and see a classic comic performance -- and a few new hairstyle ideas for good measure.

A May-December affair ... but hes May 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Prime Romance Starring Uma Thurman Meryl Streep and Bryan Greenberg. Directed by Ben Younger. (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters) Arriving unheralded and saddled with a title that sounds like its set in a butcher shop ""Prime"" is at risk of being overlooked in the crush of fall movies. That would be unfortunate because it is a cut above the formulaic romances Hollywood typically grinds out. ""Prime"" explores the pitfalls of a relationship when theres a pronounced age gap between lovers. Its different from most films on the subject -- including ""Shopgirl"" also opening today -- because the woman Rafi (Uma Thurman) is the one whos older. Shes 37 with an established career and posh Manhattan digs while her 23-year-old suitor David (Bryan Greenberg) has yet to declare an occupation. Hes moved in with his grandparents in Brooklyn to sort things out. Greenberg shares star billing with Thurman and Meryl Streep as Rafis sympathetic shrink. At the first sight of their names above the title you think ""Pick the one that doesnt belong?"" But Greenberg whos worked mostly in TV earns his spot. He brings a boyish charm and cuddly sex appeal to David; you get what Rafi sees in him. Still smarting from her recent divorce and insecure despite her dazzling looks Rafi is hurt and vulnerable qualities that Thurman is particularly good at conveying. I much preferred her as another of the walking wounded in ""Mad Dog and Glory"" than all buffed up killing Bill. David and Rafi meet impossibly cute at an Antonioni retrospective when both come back from a toilet break and find themselves locked out of ""Blowup."" Most movies dont take the time to show the process of falling in love. But here were privy to moments -- Davids eagerness to please Rafi in bed; her longing to be accepted by his family -- when an affair evolves into something deeper. ""Primes"" singular voice belongs to writer-director Ben Younger who made the compelling ""Boiler Room"" so long ago that it starred a still red hot Ben Affleck. Like other first-time filmmakers Younger promptly vanished into Hollywoods equivalent of the Bermuda Triangle. Hes finally re-emerged with a romantic saga that dares to ask realistic questions What happens when one person has all the power in a relationship? Is it better or worse if the mightier partner is female? Does a significant age difference matter if two people love each other? Much of this gets hashed out in the cozy office of Rafis therapist Lisa whose motherly approach owes more to Dr. Ruth than Dr. Freud. She encourages her client to luxuriate in her new lover until Lisa realizes that the young stud is none other than her own son. Streep who doesnt get to do nearly enough comedy is endearingly funny uncomfortably shifting in her seat and tightening her stylish wrap around her as Lisa is forced to listen to detailed descriptions of her sons private parts. There are ethical concerns about her decision to continue to treat Rafi that the script deals with only marginally. And Lisas character doesnt quite ring true. Shes supposed to be a sophisticated New Yorker yet she rushes to put a bottle of red wine in the freezer before serving it. Streep usually so pitch perfect overdoes the Jewish mother thing. But she makes believable Lisas change of heart about a May to December affair when her son is involved. For all the questions ""Prime"" raises the movie is smart enough not to offer definitive answers. But it sure does get you thinking. -- Advisory This film contains sexual content.

"A goy a guy and a cliche - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Prime A goy a guy and a clichemovies - reviewThis films `Prime directive is recycling plot pointsOctober 28 2005|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie CriticPrime mercifully is not about higher-level mathematics. But it has everything to do with numbers and chemistry and formula.This featherweight comedy is about how one woman plus one guy plus his mother doesnt make a happy couple. Its about a couple whose primary chemical sparks come from the requirements of the script not anything they or to be precise he generate on the screen.Its a TV dramedy a Sex in the City or to cite the exact source plagiarized that 80s classic thirtysomething -- with a dash of Seinfeld Mad About You and every Woody Allen comedy about Jewish men dating shiksas.But since todays kids dont know from Woody Allen or thirtysomething lets run through that Jewish boy/Jewish mom shtick again for good measure. And Prime does have its moments.Uma Thurman is Rafi fresh off a divorce and just now realizing at 37 that she wants a baby. The only person she can talk to about this is her therapist played by Meryl Streep. But the ticking clock is not Rafis prime directive. Its barely in the plot at the films beginning and end a minor sin in writer-director Ben Youngers (Boiler Room) derivative script.Bryan Greenberg of The Perfect Score is Dave a swinging callow hipster about town. At 23 he wants to be an artist but isnt hasnt figured out women bonds most closely with a George Costanza-ish jerk (Jon Abrahams) who thinks hitting failed dates with a cream pie is ""cute"" and lives with his grandparents.Oy.He meets rebounding Rafi while shes with mutual friends and hes actually on a date with another woman whom he insults out of his life.Naturally Dave and Rafi ""have a moment."" Naturally they go out after he hems and haws high-school fashion over whether to call her. Naturally she figures hes 29 because well he seems so mature.Yeah the ways they hook up are arbitrary and all wrong. The kicker is that she bares her soul about this new infatuation sex and all with her shrink. And the shrink made effortlessly funny by Streep realizes that the boy Jew dating her blond client is her own son. She being the classic cliche of the Jewish mama (Manischewitz in the fridge corned-beef-on-rye deli sandwiches) doesnt approve.Oy again.Skip past the ethical implications of who should be counseling whom; the tired extended-family haggling over Friday-night Shabbat dinner with its implied ""Why cant you meet a nice Jewish girl?"" vibe the way people keep calling ""the child"" ""the boy"" etc. ""so funny"" when he really isnt and Prime still manages a number of decent PG-13 laughs.Theres a scene where the women figure out whos related to whom that is a model of great comic acting -- Streep only has to say ""Hes my son"" and then she and Thurman react mostly without words to the shock and embarrassment of it all. Prime stuff. Thurman has never looked more ravishing. Streep is so good that she overcomes a wardrobe that seems almost a modern-Jewish-mama cliche. You half expect her to burst into ""Sunrise Sunset.""As for the rest well if youre old enough to remember Jewish biologically clocked photographer Melissas fling with that hunky goy-boy/would-be artist on thirtysomething youve seen it youve heard it and youve felt it all before.In prime time no less.

""Prime"" - what the heck does that mean? Fast on the heels of ""Proof"" it seemed unlikely that this could be the seasons second movie about numbers prime or otherwise. After seeing the movie starring Uma Thurman and Meryl Streep as client and psychoanalyst and Bryan Greenberg as the young man who comes between them its clear theres more amiss than a title. Though it turns out ""Prime"" does have something to do with a number 14 to be exact. Outside of a movie theater 37-year-old Rafi (Thurman) meets 23-year-old David (Greenberg). Shes with her friends. Hes waiting for his date. The look that passes between them stands as cinemas shorthand for ""love at first sight"" though mature moviegoers might recognize it as ""attraction at first glimpse."" Of course there wouldnt be much of a movie if we didnt go with Youngers premise that these two different people dont just crave each other they grow to love each other. Thurmans fine performance gives Rafi a kind of awareness that makes it difficult to believe shed bother with David. When the freshly divorced Rafi tells her therapist that shes met someone much younger (27 she lies) Metzger (Streep) tells her to go with it not realizing the man in question is her only son David. Not quite a romantic comedy ""Prime"" is a hybrid of conflicting tones. Much of its comedy - some of it funny too much of it obvious - rides on the revelation that David is Metzgers son. Thats uncomfortable enough news for Metzger to immediately consult her own shrink. But theres a bigger wrinkle than Metzgers ethical concerns. As compassionate and warm as Metzger the analyst is Metzger the mother is another story. Jewish she wants David to marry within the faith. Streep was wise to underplay Metzgers first inkling of trouble. Her hysteria is an implosion. Yet theres something very authentic and deeply uncomfortable about Metzgers cultural bigotry. ""Primes"" drama comes from tensions a couple with such different life experience between them might stumble on. Davids best friend Morris (Jon Abrahams) is a shamefully appealing fool who never makes it to a second date. Rafis dearest friends are gainfully employed and summer in the Hamptons. His day-job wage affords him an apartment with much older roommates - his grandparents. Her high-fashion gig sends her to Europe and brings her home to a comfortably swank abode. Only Davids aspirations as a painter make their relationship vaguely believable. Remember that scene where Rafi and David first meet? After the movie Rafi and her pals and David and his date go out. Asked how long theyve been dating David says too quickly ""Were not dating."" Its a cutting moment. And while it may be honest it left us wondering for the rest of the film what Rafi would ever see in him.  | ""Prime"" PG-13 for sexual content including dialogue and for language|1 hour 45 minutes|COMEDY|Written and directed by Ben Younger; photography by William Rexer;starring Uma Thurman Meryl Streep Bryan Greenberg Jon Abrahams |Opens today at area theaters.

FACT BOXPrime Starring Meryl Streep Uma Thurman Bryan Greenberg Written and directed by Ben Younger Studio Universal YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Uma Thurman Meryl Streep or Create Your Own Manage Alerts | What Is This? (CNN) -- Theres a bright new talent in town and his name is Ben Younger.The 32-year-old Younger made an impressive writing and directing debut in 2000 with the intense drama ""Boiler Room."" Now hes switching gears -- and showing exceptional range -- with an extremely well-written adult romantic comedy ""Prime"" starring Meryl Streep and Uma Thurman.Thurman stars as Rafi a 37-year-old recent divorcee who -- against her better judgment -- becomes involved in a relationship with a 23-year-old painter named David played by Bryan Greenberg.The complications of her love at first sight May-December affair become the main topic of conversation in free-wheeling therapy sessions with Dr. Lisa Metzger played delightfully by Streep.Rafi is worried. She and David a few differences she tells Dr. Metzger and then theres that 14-year age gap and Davids demanding relationship with his overly protective Jewish mother. But shes obviously happy and Metzger encourages her to enjoy the young mans youthful attentions.So Rafi does and in a series of increasing funny scenes Rafi describes in graphic detail all the ins and outs of their sexual encounters with Metzger egging her on from the sidelines.And then it dawns on Metzger that the young man in question is actually her own son. Suddenly shes hearing all the gory details of her darling little boys sexual proclivities. Watching Thurman gush and Streep blush is truly hilarious.Refreshingly brightIt all makes for great comedy -- and also some thoughtful insights. Younger layers and builds the story taking advantage of every opportunity for humor while also creating a very candid portrait of a modern adult relationship.A character-based adult comedy has become a rare item in Hollywood. ""Prime"" is refreshingly bright unpredictable and intelligent while still offering moments of giddy humor that take you totally by surprise.Streep is without doubt one of the worlds greatest dramatic actresses but she can also let it rip when it comes to comedy. Her timing is impeccable. Its also nice to see Thurman in a light-hearted role after all the blood and guts of the two ""Kill Bill"" movies.Youngers insight into the female psyche is remarkable and his characters are wonderfully complex.The title of the film refers to the fact that the two lovers are both in their sexual prime. But fortunately it also describes the quality of the film. ""Prime"" is the best comedy Ive seen this year.

This romantic comedys predictability and rather dull love story make it the cinematic equivalent of a slightly stale hamburger. Opening up Meryl Streep left is a therapist helping Uma Thurman and her -- oops cant tell you that. Universal Studios Meryl Streeps character -- a humorous blend of open-minded therapist and neurotic Jewish mother -- makes the movie worth watching. Though drama has always been her strong suit its a joy to watch her increasingly explore the comedic realm and be just as compelling in funny roles as she is in serious ones. (She was hilarious in Adaptation Lemony Snicket and Stuck on You.) The movies weakest moments center on the romance between Uma Thurman a recently divorced 37-year-old photographer and Bryan Greenberg an artsy 23-year-old living with his grandparents. Their chemistry is spotty at best. About the movie Prime   1/2 (out of four) Stars Meryl Streep Uma Thurman Bryan Greenberg Director Ben Younger Distributor Universal Pictures Rating PG-13 for sexual content including dialogue and for language Running time 1 hour 45 minutes Opens Friday nationwide Thurman is a bit low-key in the role. Prime might have been more charming had someone such as Reese Witherspoon or Jennifer Garner been cast. Greenberg is affable and effective as a young painter feeling familial pressure to choose a more conventional path. There is a key secret to the movie that gives it its oomph and we wont spoil the surprise though the trailer may have already dropped a ton of hints. Unfortunately the surprise is revealed about halfway through the movie. And once the secret is out the movie begins to lose steam. Streep plays Thurmans therapist and the films best moments are during their sessions. There is a particularly funny scene where Streep knows more than she lets on during one of their appointments. Her physical reactions and facial expressions are a hoot. An offbeat and funny bit involving a departed grandmother ends up a bit jarring its eccentric style feeling as if it belongs in another more quirky film. Contemporary dating certainly lends itself to humor and romantic comedies have milked to death some of the more obvious jokey aspects surrounding relationships. Prime does its share of milking often coming up sour. Several of the jokes and scenarios feel as if weve seen them before. Theres even a gag involving an immature and misogynistic fellow whose retaliation against women who dump him is to throw a pie in their faces. That might be pretty hilarious if it occurred at a clowns convention but its not funny here.

Save for later Saved Meryl Streep mines unexpected pathos in a comedic role as an overbearing mother. By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor October 28 2005 Save for later Saved This must be the season for older-meets-younger romances. Last week we had ""Shopgirl"" where Steve Martin woefully wooed Claire Danes. Now we have ""Prime"" a comedy written and directed by the aptly named Ben Younger which has Uma Thurmans Rafi 37 and recently divorced lusting after Bryan Greenbergs David 23 and living with his grandparents. Its a relief having the woman be the older one for a change but theres an even bigger twist Rafis therapist Lisa played by Meryl Streep in beads and bangs is unknown to her patient Davids mother.Youngers first feature was the bracingly acerbic ""Boiler Room"" about sub-Wall Street scroungers that looked like it was fueled by 90-proof testosterone. ""Prime"" is a much lighter and more farcical affair.Just in case we didnt think that the age differences here were enough of a roadblock Younger also plays up another angle Rafi is Catholic and David is Jewish. His family especially his mother are dead set against his dating anyone outside the faith. But since neither Rafi nor David are particularly religious this conflict doesnt really add much to the mix. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Its just an excuse for a lot of Yiddish-mama shtick although Streep who seems to have found a new lease on life as a loosey-goosey comedienne does more with it than might have seemed possible. The scene where she guesses the identity of Rafis lover is a classic - alone in her office horrified she reverts to deep breathing exercises and yoga and makes it look like heavy calisthenics. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Lisas attempts to control her son are really expressions of love. (This is what gives Streeps performance its dollop of depth). The love that builds between Rafi and David is a bit more complicated. Because he doesnt fully characterize either of them Younger makes us see their relationship as doomed by age and circumstance.David for example is a talented artist but we never really hear him talk about what inspires him. And Rafi whose desire for a baby is ticking away doesnt talk to him very often about her deepest concerns. There are a few moments when their age difference is tartly summarized She is stunned that he had never heard of John Coltrane; he would rather play Nintendo than have sex. But not much is made of the allure of those differences. Most of the time were left with the usual wink-wink stuff about a younger mans prowess.Frankly the most disturbing thing about ""Prime"" is that Uma Thurman is now officially an Older Woman.

"Prime | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; prime ) Prime (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Consider a movie that takes place in the Big Apple and features a heterosexual romance with an age gap a dose of ""Jewishness"" a psychoanalyst and an ending that doesnt pander to all the usual clichA(c)s. This may sound like Woody Allen - in fact it often feels like Woody Allen (minus the expected helpings of angst) - but its not. Prime is from writer/director Ben Younger and while its not up to the level of Allens great romantic comedies (Annie Hall Manhattan) its better than anything the acclaimed New York auteur has brought to the screen in recent years. Prime accedes to a number of the romantic comedy formulas to keep aficionados of the genre happy while at the same time flouting enough of them to remain fresh and engaging. It also manages the difficult task of making the material funny without turning in into a sit-com. (Although there are a few times when it threatens to cross the line - consider the grandmother with the frying pan.) Prime is amusing and romantic and offers a few intelligent opinions about the difficulties of bridging cultural and generational gaps in dating. Movies often treat these issues as either inconsequential or insurmountable. Prime falls more realistically in the middle ground; the keys to success are not love and passion but commitment and maturity. Rafi Gardet (Uma Thurman) is a 37-year old woman who on the rebound from a messy divorce finds herself head-over-heels in love with Dave Bloomberg (Bryan Greenberg) a man 14 years her junior. And as if the age gap is not enough Dave is Jewish while Rafi is not. This doesnt mean much to Dave but its an issue for his mother Lisa (Meryl Streep) who cant bear to think about her son in love with someone who isnt Jewish. Rafi confides all the intimate details of her new love affair with her therapist - the same Lisa Metzger who is Daves mother. Both women are unaware of their non-professional connection until Lisa figures it out. At that point she has a dilemma terminate her sessions with Rafi or do her best to keep her composure and continue the therapy. While she is wrestling with this decision Rafi and Dave encounter the first rough patches of their new relationship. Prime treads carefully around the issue of ethics. For us to accept Lisa as more than an interfering mother we have to believe she has Rafis best interests at heart and we do. Although Lisas sessions with Rafi are laced with comedic moments (such as one in which Rafi confesses ""[Daves] penis is so beautiful I just want to knit it a hat"" - something Im sure no mother wants to hear about her son no matter how flattering the revelation may be) theres an undercurrent of seriousness. Give at least partial credit to Meryl Streep who refuses to allow Lisa to sink to the level of a caricature. By keeping her real the film avoids a significant misstep. Having finished attempting to kill Bill Uma Thurman gets a chance to relax in a less physical role. She outshines her younger and less experienced co-star Bryan Greenberg but the two display enough chemistry to keep the film from stalling. Its easier to see what Dave sees in Rafi than the other way around. I suppose the allure of youth physical attractiveness and innocence is enough to blind Rafi to her lovers shortcomings - including a preference for playing video games over frolicking in the bedroom. Although Rafi and Daves relationship faces hurdles the film does not throw the obligatory ""romantic complications"" subplot at us - at least not in the expected fashion. Prime is smarter and more sophisticated than that. And the resolution takes viewers in a different direction than that of most romantic comedies. We get to see what happens after the main story is over. Is the epilogue necessary? Probably not but it adds another dimension to the movie and makes me wish more romantic comedies would go this route. The writer/director is Ben Younger who is making his first feature since 2000s The Boiler Room. Prime is a different kind of project but the screenplay shows evidence that Younger is a keen observer of human interaction and there are enough small touches to indicate that he understands a little about the difficulties inherent in a coupling where one participant is significantly older than the other. Unlike many movies reaching theaters at this time of the year Prime is not an Oscar contender but its a satisfying romantic comedy and a worthwhile diversion.

Plus David wants to be an artist and what kind of career is that for a princeling? By the end everyones okay with everything because -- well because the therapist in this brazenly preposterous romantic comedy is Meryl Streep whipping up shameless fun by miming what verklemmt looks like among a certain population of middle-aged public-radio tote-bag carriers. Not one bit of the story tracks. But with these women in these roles youre asking for truth? Prime (written and directed by Boiler Rooms Ben Younger) is much more interested in the interpretation of dreams than how a hottie like Thurman could be interested in a blandy like Greenberg.

Despite a comic Yiddishe mama turn by Meryl Streep and a sensitively nuanced perf by Uma Thurman in a convincing changeup from her recent kickass action roles ""Prime"" remains an oddly juiceless older woman-younger man romance with a Freudian twist. Lead actresses acquit themselves swimmingly generating believable chemistry and plenty of estrogen with boychik Bryan Greenberg also passing muster. But secondary characters drearily one-dimensional die on the vine in a slick but cliche script by writer-director Ben Younger (""Boiler Room"") that narratively hedges its bets. Even for femme auds ""Prime"" skedded to open Oct. 28 rates a cut below grade A. Rafi (Thurman) has just terminated a loveless nine-year marriage and is dependent on her shrink Lisa Metzger (Streep) for friendship and support. That support is seriously threatened when Rafi starts dating and sleeping with David (Greenberg) who happens to be Metzgers son (a fact Metzger discovers but which is unknown to everyone else). Rafi wrestles with the problems inherent in a relationship with a much younger man from his adolescent reluctance to clean the apartment when he moves in to his occasional preference for Nintendo over sex. Meanwhile would-be artist David who lived with his grandparents and was discouraged from taking his painting seriously strives to hide the full extent of his immaturity from his stylish sophisticated paramour. Metzger the most conflicted character finds her genuine affection for Rafi to be jeopardized -- Metzgers liberal laissez-faire acceptance of her patients sexuality turns out to be at odds with her motherly fear of shiksas and need to control her son. The Modern Romantic Comedy has become more elusive than the Great American Novel these days and in his updated spin helmer-scribe Younger has baited viewers with one too many hooks. The course of true love is doubly roughed by the fact that the lovers are not only separated by age (she is a gorgeous-looking 37 he a hunky-but-sensitive 23) but religion as well. Streeps rather broad interpretation of the ""Jewish mother"" with its fine comic flourishes would play beautifully except for the fact that shes surrounded by a family of flat joyless caricatures that sap the ethnic juices out of the whole religious ""dilemma."" Thurman on her side exists in an equally one-note milieu of rich gay men friends snooty in-people and sterile open spaces (stark vast art galleries or studio haute couture shoots) that generally signal WASPdom as the absence of local color. Only Annie Parisse as one of Thurmans svelte fashion industry friends manages to breathe life into her severely limited sidekick role. The same cannot be said of Davids boyhood chum Morris (John Abrahams) who in lieu of a personality is granted a propensity to anoint ex-girlfriends with custard pies in a running gag that gets less and less funny. Greenberg a relative unknown actually succeeds in essaying the difficult seemingly oxymoronic role of sexy mamas boy David. But films main focus is the relationship between the two gals as Streep and Thurmans obvious enjoyment in playing off each other enhances their double entendre-laden psychiatric sessions. Rafis ingenuous wonderfully delivered concerns about robbing the cradle and confidences about her young lovers sexual prowess are received by Dr. Metzger with nicely mingled therapeutic encouragement and maternal horror. At the same time the frumpified Joy Behar-esque Streep and the blond willowy va-va-voom-y Thurman rep two separate aspects of the same woman the matriarchal and sexual sides comically dialoguing at cross-purposes.
