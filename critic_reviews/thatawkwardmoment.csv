Comments click to enlarge That Awkward Moment Video Rated R  94 minutes  2014 Mainstream comedy directors have come to value one-liners as ends in themselves which is why their movies have cobbled-together quips instead of dialogue. The refreshing thing about this otherwise formulaic romantic comedy is that writer-director Tom Gormican gives the verbal humor some rhythm shooting many of the dialogue-driven scenes in long takes so they develop a pleasing ebb and flow. Two single upwardly mobile New Yorkers (Zac Efron Miles Teller) promise to help their recently divorced best friend (Michael B. Jordan) navigate the dating scene but renege on their offer when each meets the girl of his dreams. With Imogen Poots.

"Dumpuary Movie Report The Naked Awfulness of That Awkward Moment Ride Along and Labor Day << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Dumpuary Movie Report The Naked Awfulness of That Awkward Moment Ride Along and Labor Day Movies January 31 2014 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print When bad movies end with a blooper reel youre supposed to think This is how much worse it could have been But really blooper reels add insult to injury. Youre forced to acknowledge that someone actually was in charge of the dull moronic mess you just watched. Remaining seated becomes a forensic opportunity So this is how this was so bad. That Awkward Moment is bad but its scarcely the worst. It wants to be one of those we-had-a-deal comedies in which the characters agree to participate in or abstain from some sexual or romantic rite with Seinfelds ""master of your domain"" masturbation pact being the landmark of the genre. At some point someone says ""I thought we had a deal"" The friendships fracture for a couple of scenes (or one long montage). Then coincidence or a ""one year later"" tag heals all. A moderately smart movie would have pushed back against the formula. That Awkward Moment simply mistakes being obnoxious for being clever. Here three Manhattan friends (played by Michael B. Jordan Zac Efron and Miles Teller) mutually agree to stay single but just wind up closeting their romantic commitments. Even by the loose standards of bromantic comedy these are outrageously low stakes. Jordans doctor comes home one day to a request for divorce. He wants to fight for the marriage but his two buddies -- they design ""chick lit"" book covers -- want him to give up so he can seduce and carouse with them. Whats the price for violating the pact? Whats its point? Its that dudes have to be dudes and being a dude means going home with a girl you meet at a bar -- as Ephron does with Imogen Poots -- and trying to sneak out of her apartment because the thigh-high boots envelopes of cash and copy of Story of O in her bedroom spell prostitute. (Not only does Pootss character show up a scene or two later as a prospective author in need of book-jacket design shes also the sort of character who when Efron explains why he left still continues to date him. Id love to see the movie in which she sits down for brunch and tries explaining that to her girlfriends.) The movie is going for a kind of Taming of the Douche. But none of the three stars is really up to the task. To Jordans credit hes playing the one least interested in being a jerk. Hes got a swaggering sweetness that makes the characters refusal to give up interesting. You just dont believe the movies version of the situation. Its as if writer-director Tom Gormican heard that people get divorced and sleep around but has no idea what making either funny entails. Anyway when he gets to play confident Jordan seems unstoppable. All the sexiness Efron keeps trying for Jordan has coming out of his eyelashes. Efron has become a pleasure to watch. Hes Shia LaBeouf without the hot air and fifth shot of espresso. He just lacks the threat that can turn his hotness into danger. He might never get to Christian Bale in American Psycho or Leonardo DiCaprio in The Wolf of Wall Street. In this movie he gets to be profane and pump his front into a womans rear. But as an immoral star hes still only a Disney Family-level asshole. Teller plays the most maladroit of the three. He softens the misogyny by treating it as something less galling. When a gentleman comes on to the friend (Mackenzie Davis) his character will spend the rest of the movie secretly sleeping with he says ""You can tame her with tequila and compliments."" The insults gush from him as they do from Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill. Teller is also unusual looking yet happens to be a better handsomer actor who can give the offensiveness a psychological changeup. Rogen and Hill project. Teller performs. As actors these three have little to do with each other. I was curious to see a movie attempt to harmonize them. To some extent Gormican manages it but the result just ends up being New Girl but limp. That Awkward Moment plays with the cliche of pricks being princes in need of a princess. But Im not sure the movie even believes that to be true. Its both too cynical and too cute. One scene sees Efron and Teller present a new book design explaining that women will buy any book with shoes on the cover and one of the women in the room blurts out ""I love it."" Only in this fantasy would a woman say that. Only in this fantasy would bromance skip romantic comedy and shoot straight for dick lit.  Ride Along doesnt end with a blooper reel -- just more movie. Its like an overflowing toilet. But for two weeks its been at the top of the American box office. This means there will really be no living with Kevin Hart who was last seen being swatted away by the stars of Grudge Match. Even though this time its Ice Cube doing the swatting the movie is all Harts. He squeaks and screams and talks the way Usain Bolt runs. In a big ensemble comedy -- Think Like a Man for instance or BETs Real Husbands of Hollywood -- his humiliated mock outrage works because youre not stuck with him. Given how big a hit Ride Along appears to be we all are now. Hart plays a do-nothing whos been accepted into Atlantas police academy and needs the approval of his fiancees brother before they can get married. The brother happens to be Ice Cube a detective who cant stand him and drags Hart to work to scare him out of both police work and marriage. Needless to say the plot twists and Hart proves accidentally invaluable. The movies lousiness comes directly from its slap-together laziness (Tim Story directed; four credited writers typed). It could have been the farce of Training Day. Instead the whole thing leans on Ice Cubes scowl and Harts eagerness to please. Meanwhile as Harts girlfriend Tika Sumpter is meant to be a vision of tolerance and well just a vision. She spends the climax as a damsel in workout shorts and a top and seems -- here anyway -- to have arrived from the Kerry Washington-Zoe Saldana-Gabrielle Union bougie-beauty factory. Also here thanklessly are John Leguizamo Bryan Callen and Laurence Fishburne who actually bothers trying to give a performance. Its bad but its something. All the while Hart is jumping up and down not listening causing trouble. You dont know whether to put him in another movie or a timeout. He and Ice Cube bring nothing out of each other. The movie is one of those Coors Light ads in which Ice Cube gets frosted by an inanimate can of sassy beer. Now the beer is Hart who as a comedian has been begging for Hollywoods attention for five years. He has it now but youve got to believe he can do better than this.  I walked by posters for That Awkward Moment and Ride Along and looked around the theater lobby waiting for someone to say ""Just kidding"" Jason Reitmans Labor Day is 111 minutes of a ""just kidding"" that never arrives. I saw the movie first last fall (and wrote about it then) and remain astonished by its earnestness and ludicrousness. Josh Brolin escapes from prison and holds Kate Winslet and her teenage son (Gattlin Griffith) hostage in her stately New England home. Were meant to find this scenario mysterious but it turns laughable fast. At some point Winslet complains about her bowl of spoiled peaches and Brolin suggests making dessert. And so these two and the boy stand together mixing peach filling their hands sloshing in the same bowl. You can believe Reitman was drawn to the colors of Joyce Maynards 2009 novel especially all the purple prose and the opportunity to toy with flashbacks. But the information in the flashbacks is so obvious that they turn the movie into camp. But Labor Day is too dreary for camp. Its dramp. The whole film operates on a level of foolishness thats impossible to sit through with a straight face. Some of the embarrassment arises from terrible performances. Winslet can play confused. But she spends the film in a coma of bewilderment. Its probably easier to pretend youre asleep than to be tied to a chair or doing that pie sequence. This is no part for a good actor. This is no part for anybody. It barely works on the page. The rest of the embarrassment comes from how peculiarly personal this movie feels. Reitman adapted Maynards book himself and whatever he saw in it never materializes on the screen. The result is a gauzy almost unreleasable movie thats detached from its warmth. Its as if Reitman identified with every ounce of florid nonsense in the novel and arrived to the set with no idea of how to film any of it. He goes for art but its not art this material needs. Its a lit match. Filed Under Movies that awkward moment ride along Labor Day Zac Efron MICHAEL B.

Jordan Miles Teller; Director Tom Gormicon; Release Date Wide 01/31/2014; Runtime (in minutes) 94; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Focus Features Posted February 12 2014 -- 1200 AM EST Ever watched Sex and the City and thought ""Wouldnt this be better if they were guys?"" Probably not. But That Awkward Moment a new bromantic comedy gives us a glimpse at what that would be like -- and the result is a decidedly mixed (though well-dressed) bag. The plot centers on three hot-blooded twentysomethings Studly book cover designer Jason (Zac Efron) his snarky pal Daniel (Miles Teller) and their doctor buddy Mikey (Michael B. Jordan). When Mikeys marriage sours the friends make a pact to steer clear of relationships despite the throngs of lovely-and-willing young ladies threatening to snag their hearts. Romantic entanglements follow but the story is just an excuse for a bit of anthropological espionage a supposed peek at the secret life of the urban American heterosexual male. But on that level That Awkward Moment underperforms. The movies ideas about relationships wouldve felt middle-of-the-road in the 80s and its big epiphany moments (Guys can fall in love too) are shallow enough to make you long for the comparatively profound rom-com oeuvre of Kate Hudson. Luckily the three lead actors are plenty charismatic -- so much so that you wish they werent stuck in such a conventional unambitious movie. But sit tight through the end credits and youll be treated to a few off-the-cuff outtakes of the guys doing things much funnier than anything in the film itself.

"That Awkward Moment 2 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article That Awkward Moment 2 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments By Randy Cordova The Republic | azcentral.com Fri Jan 31 2014 512 PM ""That Awkward Moment"" deals with the sexual adventures of three guys in their 20s in Manhattan. Were told they were pals in college which comes in handy There is no chemistry between the actors so you wonder how they wound up as friends. The groups unofficial ringleader is Jason (Zac Efron) who designs book jackets and shuns commitment. He is the kind of guy who keeps a roster of women he sleeps with. Things start to change when he spends the night with Ellie (Imogen Poots) whom he mistakes for a prostitute. Let the knee-slapping commence. Daniel (Miles Teller aggressively unfunny) finds himself attracted to the female pal (Mackenzie Davis) who normally serves as his ""wing-woman."" Daniel has a habit of smelling up the bathroom a running gag that doesnt get funnier with repeated use. Rounding out the trio is Mikey (Michael B. Jordan from ""Fruitvale Station"") a doctor who pines for the wife who cheated on him. He is also the only one of the three who remotely resembles an adult so by default he is the most sympathetic of the trio. First-time writer-director Tom Gormican keeps the dialogue moving at a rapid pace which doesnt obscure the fact that most of what is said is dopey and witless. Tossing around obscure Morris Chestnut references may seem terribly clever but its not funny at least not here. Gormican creates wildly contrived situations that force the characters to behave like idiots. A couple has sex in a bathroom at a large family party but no one bothers to lock the door. In another scene Ellie invites Jason to a party with ""dress-up"" clothes. She means cocktail attire; he shows up in costume with a giant sex toy attached to his waist. The movie ends with a series of outtakes that features the actors flubbing their lines improvising and laughing as if this were a Burt Reynolds comedy from the late 70s. Those movies were hardly gold but they are better than whats on display here. Reach the reporter at randy.cordovaarizonarepublic.com 602-444-8849. Twitter.com/randy_cordova.

Jordan. 253 Shares Share 174 Tweet 79 Share 0 Share Email Print Share Photo Focus Features In the new psychological thriller That Awkward Moment Zac Efron gives an uncannily cool performance as a sociopath whose promiscuous ways are interrupted by the arrival of a particularly adorable new prey played by Imogen Poots. The film largely centered around this vapid monsters insincere but tragically effective wooing of his sassy yet vulnerable female victim could have easily been mistaken for a romantic comedy. But writer-director Tom Gormican and Efron clearly signal to us what kind of film it is by making sure the actor never emotes -- that the icky shadow of human feeling and passion never passes across his immobile dreamy face. The film follows three young men -- hunky player Jason (Efron) nebbishy player Daniel (Miles Teller) and responsible family man Mikey (Michael B. Jordan) -- who were best friends in college and are now making their lives in New York. As a paramour tearfully breaks up with him in one of the films opening scenes Jason confides to us in voice-over ""I wasnt confused that she was breaking up with me. I was confused that she thought we were even dating."" Efron conveys the characters insincerity well in these opening scenes and -- again -- were this film to be a romantic comedy it would have been interesting to see how the story took this soulless calculating figure and turned him into something resembling an actual person. But Efrons complete refusal (or perhaps inability) to convey anything resembling emotion or tenderness doesnt seem particularly suited to romantic comedy. And That Awkward Moment seems to understand that. How else to explain for instance a late scene where Jason refuses to attend a funeral important to Ellie because it would somehow make them officially an ""item""? Only a sociopath would behave this carelessly and as such That Awkward Moment makes for an interesting study in abnormal criminal behavior. The somewhat more sarcastic Daniel is kind of a Jason-in-training He too goes around bedding random women he meets in bars but instead of playing the emotionless jerk card like Jason does he pretends to be the young innocent virgin. Mikey on the other hand is the responsible one the one who ""checked all the boxes"" after college -- going to med school getting married getting a job. Unfortunately for him his wife wants a divorce after bedding down with a strapping Morris Chestnut type. So in solidarity with the newly single Mikey Jason and Daniel vow to each other that theyll remain single -- which seems an innocuous enough promise since theyre committed singles to begin with. Alas these plans are soon upended by the arrival in Jasons life of Ellie (Poots) a young publishing assistant and by Daniels realization that he is actually quite attracted to his very close friend Chelsea (Mackenzie Davis). But because these characters have a pact -- and not just a pact but a Movie Pact which means that it must not be broken except in the most ridiculously inane way possible -- they keep their burgeoning long-lasting relationships from each other. If the film did want to be a romantic comedy -- and again believe me this is purely hypothetical -- it would have most likely put the storys focus on Daniel who is funnier or Mikey who seems to be more romantic as opposed to Jason who is cool and calculating and quite possibly not even human. The actors would certainly be better suited to the genre Teller brings a jokey energy to the immature Daniel and Jordans puppy-dog woundedness as Mikey is touching. A The women are excellent as well The broad-featured Poots does a fine balancing act between confident NYC dreamer and needy young thing and Mackenzie Davis as Daniels gal pal cum paramour is something of a revelation with her irresistible casualness and strangely refined sexiness -- at times I wanted the entire movie to be about her. In such a scenario Efrons Jason could have made for interesting supporting comic relief and the actor might have been allowed a certain amount of devilish charisma; think back for example to Vince Vaughns motor-mouth lady-killer Trent in Swingers. As a leading man however Efron has never been good at conveying depth and the siren song of his looks has shattered its share of films on the treacherous reefs of emotional vapidity. In The Lucky One he did okay making doe eyes with Taylor Schilling but he couldnt do the tormented veteran thing. In That Awkward Moment he starts off as a craven soulless dirtbag and he seems very adept at conveying disingenuousness. But the emotional arc hes been outfitted with is betrayed by the actors inability to transform in any meaningful way. The effect is downright chilling. And might I add again neither romantic nor funny. A This post has been corrected as it initially confused The Lucky One with The Brave One.

That Awkward Moment By Peter Travers January 31 2014 More News 2013s Best Movies All Stories >> More News 2013s Best Movies All Stories >> Take three horny guys all twentysomethings mix with a plot that was old last century and serve to an audience so desperate for dick jokes and toilet gags they might forgive a movie wired only with cliches. The compensation comes in the three lead actors all way too good for the material dished out by writer-director Tom Gormican. Michael B. Jordan so memorable in Fruitvale Station plays Mickey a Manhattan doctor whose wife dumps him. In crisis he turns to his buds book-cover designers Jason (Zac Efron) and Daniel (Miles Teller). The guys decide a marathon of one-night stands is the answer. No commitments. Thats the ideal way to avoid - wait for it - that awkward moment when a babe decides she wants to get serious. Efron is the alleged sex god--in one scene he even sports a dildo--who breaks the rules by falling for Ellie (Imogen Poots). And for symmetry Daniel realizes that his non-sex buddy Chelsea (the appealing Mackenzie Davis) is turning him on. Kudos to Teller (The Spectacular Now) for generating whatever laughs manage to poke their heads above this sea of misogyny and missed opportunities.

(Focus Features) Imogen Poots and Zac Efron in That Awkward Moment.(Focus Features) That Awkward Moment A comedy with commitment issues Add to ... Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jan. 31 2014 1201AM EST Last updated Friday Jan. 31 2014 1201AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Tom Gormican Written by Tom Gormican Starring Zac Efron Michael B. Jordan Miles Teller Classification 14A Year 2014 Country USA Language English Three male friends make a pact to stay single and play the field in That Awkward Moment a first-time feature from Tom Gormican that tries to mix Hangover raunch with a heartfelt Jerry Maguire-style romance in what might be more aptly titled Those Awkward 94 Minutes.Zac Efron stars as Jason the swaggering narrator of the story. Along with his sardonic buddy Daniel (Miles Teller) he works in one of those quaint romcom-type artisanal careers designing book covers for a boutique Manhattan publishing house. The gig is improbably lucrative enough to keep him living in a chic brick-walled loft with enough money left over for hair gel and a nightly bar tab. Their other friend Mikey (Michael B. Jordan) has a real job as a workaholic ER doctor. When Mikey gets dumped by his wife Vera (Jessica Lucas) for another guy Jason and Daniel make a vow to help him play the field. In one of those pals-before-gals pacts (which date back to Shakespeares Loves Labours Lost) they agree that none of them can fall in love. In a contemporary update theyll work to expand their ""rosters"" of booty calls. The ""awkward moment"" of the movies title refers to the supposed occasion when a female friend with benefits decides to call in her debts and demands to know where the relationship is headed.Predictably the best-laid plans and best-planned lays go awry. Soon all three men are seeing someone special while trying to keep it from their bros. Jason meets and beds a smart-talking young woman at a bar Ellie (Imogen Poots of A Late Quartet) whom he initially mistakes for a hooker before he falls in love with her when he discovers shes a patrician type who runs a literary lecture series. At the same time Daniel starts noticing his gorgeous gangly wise-cracking girl buddy Chelsea (Vancouver native Mackenzie Davis whos terrific) because hed be crazy not to. Meanwhile Mikey is secretly trying to patch things up with his unfaithful wife. Jessica Lucass Vera in a handful of scenes is never more than a vain cheat while both Poots and Davis in their brief underwritten roles register as considerably more interesting than their emotionally stunted male counterparts.Efron though consistently looking overstyled is decent enough as a redeemable jerk within the limitations of the script. After letting Ellie down at a critical moment he makes up for it with one of those heart-felt public speeches that seems less poetic than trite.The films more irksome offence is the waste of Teller and Jordan who starred in two of the best American independent features last year. Teller who did a superb turn as a teen-aged alcoholic in The Spectacular Now here offers a junior version of that sleepy-eyed sarcastic Bill Murray/Vince Vaughn shtick He coasts at being a coaster. In Fruitvale Station Jordan played a young African-American man killed on New Years Eve by transit police. Jordan who was loose and charismatic in that film is straitjacketed here as a vulnerable nerd with a woeful lack of spontaneity.In one of the movies numbingly dumb series of penis and toilet jokes Mikey pleasures himself using some of Daniels tanning cream leading to selective discolouration. In the hands (and minds) of Judd Apatow or the Farrelly brothers this sort of line-walking gross-out might have pushed some interesting buttons - but here nothing. Like its characters That Awkward Moment has commitment issues It lacks the courage of its bad taste.

Jordan Directed by Tom Gormican Rated R for sexual content and language throughout Running time 1 hour 34 minutes Playing Throughout Orange County (See theaters and movie times)The quick hitManhattan Peter Pans fly away from adulthood in this clunky sappy big-screen sitcom. Grade D+ The title of this strained sentimental ensemble dramedy refers to that instant when a bedmate asks ""So ... where is this going?"" Apply that question to the movie and the answer is a cul-de-sac or maybe a blind alley. Part of its problem is infantilism. Neuropsychiatrist Daniel Siegel says that adolescence extends through age 24. He might want to push that to 26 after watching writer-director Tom Gormicans group portrait of frat-boy-like New Yorkers and the women who service or love them. Gormican sets himself the impossible task of asking us to care for semi-grown men who fool themselves into thinking that nirvana consists of emotion-free hookups interspersed with ecstatic nights of video games. The plot kicks in when Michael B. Jordan playing a doctor who married a lawyer (Jessica Lucas) is told that his wife wants a divorce and is sleeping with her lawyer. His two best college pals played by Zac Efron and Miles Teller coerce him into a pact that theyll stay unattached and just hang out and bar-hop until they reach their 30s. Its easy for that duo to make this vow - they lead one of those fantasy Gotham lives best left to sitcoms as a team that designs book covers. (Efron does the concepts and drawing; Teller appears to provide comical moral support.) The doctor cant shake off his feelings for his wife. And immediately Efron connects with a funny gal who works in publishing (Imogen Poots) and Teller with a sharp sardonic musician (MacKenzie Davis); both test the guys commitment to their buddy-buddy-buddy covenant. The movie means to show that its time for them to put aside childish things which includes Jordan accepting that his once-""perfect"" marriage has died. The movies comedy (involving for example the poor choice of an X-rated party suit) and drama (building to a heartfelt public recitation of pickup lines) are wobbly and gimmicky. Gormican may be so caught up in his own fantasies that he doesnt realize how intolerable hes made his characters. One decides not to attend the funeral of his lovers father because that would mean admitting shes his girlfriend. Efron starts snappy then overdoes the dewy-eyed regret. He and Jordan mostly play straight men to Teller who at least communicates what its like to have fun. Poots and Davis pull off the films major performing feat. They convince us that two capable talented women can see real emotion inside a couple of frivolous fratties.

Zach Efron in ""That Awkward Moment."" Photo Focus Features That Awkward Moment review Flawed but entertaining 1 / 5 Back to Gallery ""That Awkward Moment"" gets off to an unpromising start when Zac Efron in voiceover tells us that he has been sitting on a park bench for two hours that its February and hes freezing. Meanwhile he is dressed like its April and registering no distress at all no shivering no red nose no miserable expression. And so the questions arise Has anyone involved in the production ever visited New York in February? Will the whole movie be like this - unobservant full of empty gestures and pointless narration? And the answer is no. ""That Awkward Moment"" is an entertaining movie that despite some big flaws - especially near the finish - does the hard work of showing two relationships originating and growing. Its an attempt to tell a modern story about how love is done in 2014 and though it ultimately leans too much on genre cliche it reveals some of the tensions that todays young adults experience in their romantic lives - the impersonality of hook-up culture in collision with the human desire and need for intimacy. The movie revolves around three friends all in their late 20s and the ""awkward moment"" of the title refers to the one that inevitably happens after several weeks of dating One lover says to the other ""So ... "" - followed by a question such as ""Where are we heading?"" or ""What are we doing?"" The two single guys in the triumvirate of buddies Jason (Zac Efron) and Daniel (Miles Teller) want to avoid romantic entanglements and just have fun. On the periphery theres a married pal (Michael B. Jordan) who has just found out that his wife is unfaithful and wants a divorce. Both Teller and Efron play breezy guys who are very good at funny banter. Actually its possible that writer-director Tom Gormican has made their dialogue interchangeable and its only because Efron and Teller are so different in style that we dont hear the similarities. Efron is an old-time leading man an updated Tyrone Power while Teller is a sly comedian. As it is in the nature of romantic comedies that love must be affirmed both men start dating women that they care about and the saving virtue of the movie is that the audience also cares and is made to understand the mutual attractions. Easily ""That Awkward Moment"" could have been annoying. Its another movie that makes picking up beautiful women in bars look as easy as picking lint off upholstery and there are so many references to Facebook that it seems like a product placement. But the two young women in the film Imogen Poots and Mackenzie Davis are very good and Gormican directs and cuts the film so that they hold their own. Poots has some particularly strong moments as Ellie a young publisher who thinks she might be in love with Jason. You might remember Poots an English actress for her remarkable scene in ""A Late Quartet"" in which she explodes with pent-up rage. Here she keeps her powder dry but has many close-ups in which she looks at Efron as if thinking ""Are you the man I thought you were or are you turning out to be something else something a lot worse?"" Its a look that men will recognize. In its last 20 minutes ""That Awkward Moment"" falls off a bit by doing two things romantic comedies often do no matter how much we might wish they wouldnt (1) There are unnecessary complications with people misbehaving in unexpected ways just to stretch out the action; and (2) We get one of those public confessions of love of a kind that no one has done well since ""Jerry Maguire."" The reversion to formula takes a pleasing comedy and drops it down a notch but ""That Awkward Moment"" is still very easy to like. That Awkward Moment Romantic comedy. Starring Zac Efron Miles Teller Michael B. Jordan Mackenzie Davis and Imogen Poots. Directed by Tom Gormican. (R. 94 minutes.) Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

"Review That Awkward Moment proves that Michael B. Jordan is a star - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview That Awkward Moment proves that Michael B. Jordan is a starBy Randy MyersSan Jose Mercury News CorrespondentPosted 01/30/2014 030000 PM PSTUpdated 01/30/2014 031118 PM PST Despite one charmer of a performance and one particularly hilarious party scene ""That Awkward Moment"" is forgettable a so-so time-filler youd discover on late-night cable and later have a dickens of a time remembering the title even the next day.The Zac Efron Michael B. Jordan and Miles Teller comedy manages to distinguish itself by taking the well-traveled rom-com out for some off-road riding. Instead of focusing on the hookups and hang-ups of women -- the usual offerings in this genre -- ""Awkward"" focuses on the dating predicaments of a trio of New York guys in their 20s. Sounds like the flip side to HBOs ""Girls""? Not a chance. Despite being a little raunchy this film plays it too safe. What buoys ""Awkward"" are the performances of two of its rising stars ""Fruitvale Stations"" Jordan -- who gives the film its heart and steals every scene hes in -- and ""The Spectacular Nows"" Teller who earns decent laughs. Theyre better than the hit-and-miss script especially the charismatic Jordan. The same cant be said of Efron who pulls off a few comic moments but still remains so overearnest in the dramatic parts you cant help but wince. The ultimate failing though is the films premise which forces characters to act ridiculously just because of the inane plot device. As the production notes reveal director and screenwriter Tom Gormican drew inspiration from Shakespeares ""Loves Labours Lost."" However his belabored contrivance just isnt credible that three best buds would make a pact to not take their relationships from casual dating to the next level after one of them (Jordan) finds himself newly single -- his wife is having an affair and wants a divorce. Advertisement Naturally the stereotypical dudes -- studly player Jason (Efron) uncouth funny guy Daniel (Teller) and sensitive sweetheart Mikey (Jordan) -- struggle to keep the bet. Jason the least interesting of the three and the central character meets his ""match"" in Ellie (a sexy Imogen Poots) at a bar. Meanwhile Daniel connects with an opposites-attract friend Chelsea (Mackenzie Davis) and Mikey well lets avoid any spoilers here since there are few to be had.Despite the noble intentions to make a rom-com from the mans perspective ""That Awkward Moment"" winds up feeling old-school. The quality and standards of cable TV shows such as ""Girls"" have upped the game for movies like this. And even though ""Awkward"" has its moments it winds up lagging behind more daring endeavors on TV right now. The film industry had better keep up.That Awkward MomentH  Rating R (for sexual content and language throughout)Cast Zac Efron Michael B.

"Review That Awkward Moment is uncomfortable for many reasons - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review That Awkward Moment is uncomfortable for many reasons That Awkward Moment Movie review by Betsy Sharkey Betsy Sharkey reviews That Awkward Moment Starring Zac Efron Miles Teller Imogen Poots Michael B. Jordan. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Betsy Sharkey reviews That Awkward Moment Starring Zac Efron Miles Teller Imogen Poots Michael B. Jordan. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic ""That Awkward Moment"" starring Zac Efron Michael B. Jordan Miles Teller and many beddable beauties is technically about the moment when a woman wants the relationship to be something more and the guy walks away.What ""Awkward"" is theoretically about are the ways that moment gets dicey when guys figure out they actually care about the females in question. But what ""Awkward"" is actually about albeit unintentionally is how passing off misogyny for comedy has gotten so terribly passe as insulting to the guys as to the young women. Including the actors. Jordan is currently up for an Independent Spirit Award for his excellent performance in ""Fruitvale Station"" so please remember him for that. Teller had a tart cheeky turn opposite Shailene Woodley earlier this year in ""The Spectacular Now"" with some of the sensibility of a young John Cusack. And Efron well the ""High School Musical"" star keeps landing roles that represent near-misses at establishing him as something other than a hunky lightweight. Last year it was ""Parkland"" the year before ""The Paperboy.""PHOTOS Biggest Box Office Flops of 2013 The issue is not with the premise per se. A great deal of fun even R-rated fun can be had at the expense of commitment phobia or the way libidos can short-circuit the young adult male brain. But even cheesy romantic comedies need to raise the bar a bit these days to be relevant.Hanging the humor on the quest for endless hookups the color size and proclivities of individual private parts and patterns in bowel movements -- well its asking a lot. Particularly when Lena Dunhams current HBO hit ""Girls"" is as smart as it is brash and years earlier Candace Bushnells ""Sex and the City"" did the New York yuppie entanglement thing so deliciously.Tom Gormican in his first feature as writer-director has cited his own experiences as a young single in New York and the fun of sampling the bar scene for ""That Awkwards"" tone. He also points to Shakespeares ""Loves Labours Lost"" as inspiration for the vow the guys make to stay single and spend their dating time sampling the wares. Shakespeare must be so proud.The catalyst for all the serial romancing is the news that Mikeys (Jordan) wife Vera (Jessica Lucas) is leaving him for her lawyer. Mikeys a pretty straight arrow; he wants stability. It triggers a buddy bonding moment with best friends Jason (Efron) and Daniel (Teller) all three pledging to forswear love for the foreseeable future. PHOTOS Box office top 10 of 2013Since the future is in fact un-foreseeable temptation soon arrives. For Mikey its Vera and a chance to try to work things out. For Jason its a hot new author named Ellie (Imogen Poots) whom he first mistakes for a hooker -- its a long story.And for Daniel its the very chill Chelsea (Mackenzie Davis) the girl/friend whos content to serve as Daniels wingman on the pickup scene.The film is concerned with the lifestyle of a certain class of New York single -- the promising the well-educated the upwardly mobile the attractive. Mikeys a doctor. Jason designs book covers for publishers. Daniel seems to be Jasons creative partner but its never clear what he does beyond deliver sharp verbal jabs most of them aimed at the offices aging loser (Josh Pais).When the guys are around the women of their dreams they turn sentimental. They tear up they speak from the heart they care. And they lie -- to the women to each other to themselves. Its a constant case of covering up -- except when there is sex.As base as Gormican has made the guys hes come up with a better class of female at least in a couple of cases. Ellie is by far the role model. Poots makes her sassy enough and smart enough to handle virtually any situation especially a guy. Chelsea is a pragmatist liking Daniel enough to play by his rules. Until the rules change and so do her expectations. Vera on the other hand is more naughty than nice.BEST MOVIES OF 2013 Turan | Sharkey | OlsenAll the couples spend a great deal of time in bed. And for those who are interested nearly all of Efron is on display. Same goes for Jordan and Teller but lets face it on the disrobing front Efron is the top-liner.What makes this film particularly bedeviling is that you get the sense there is a nice guy behind this mess one not so callous about matters of the heart. If anything the raunch seems forced. The closer the film gets to real emotions the more authentic it feels. Gormicans New York is inviting right on the cusp of prosperity. With the help of director of photography Brandon Trost and production designer Ethan Tobman he achieves a kind of cluttered contemporary cool for the twentysomethings and a polished elegance for their parents.

"That Awkward Moment | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; that-awkward-moment ) That Awkward Moment (United States 2014) January 30 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli That Awkward Moment exudes an ""old school"" romantic comedy vibe. (Since it borrows from Shakespeares Loves Labours Lost the ""old"" really applies here.) The script has an 80s/90s sensibility wrapped in a layer of lewd crude rude packaging. So although writer/director Tom Gormican wants his movie to hearken back to a series of films he has an affinity for (he calls out Jerry Maguire by name) hes aware that the genre has evolved to where copious amounts of profanity and frank sexual talk are expected. Its the Judd Apatow syndrome and there are times when the blend of romance and raunchiness threatens to curdle. In the end however the ""love conquers all"" mentality wins out. In the fine tradition of most ""classic"" rom-coms of decades gone by the ""romance"" element is considerably stronger than the ""comedy"" one. Thats not to say That Awkward Moment is never funny but the screenplay is stingy with moments that inspire unbridled laughter. This approach serves the storyline well; the more low-key comedic style allows the characters and their interactions to unfold gradually rather than in a flurry of punch-lines. One could argue that the central relationship in That Awkward Moment is platonic not romantic. Its the guy-bonding that occurs between best friends Jason (Zac Efron) Daniel (Miles Teller) and Mikey (Michael B. Jordan). These 20-something buddies make a pact to remain single and unattached. In the romance department its all hook-ups and one-night stands. This suits Jason fine because its how he operates. Ditto for Daniel a bar lizard whose gal pal Chelsea (Mackenzie Davis) rides shotgun and helps him pick up women. Mikey having been dumped by his wife Vera (Jessica Lucas) in a move that blindsides him is reluctant to get back into the dating scene but eventually relents. In due course these three men end up cheating on their pact. Mikey falls back into Veras orbit. Daniel discovers that Chelsea merits romantic consideration. And Jason falls for Ellie (Imogen Poots) a sweet sassy woman he initially mistakes for a hooker. Theres nothing terribly original to be found in That Awkward Moment but the genre isnt known for breaking new ground. The average romantic comedy succeeds based not on narrative innovation but on two simple factors chemistry between the characters and the ability of the filmmakers to convince the audience to root for the happily-ever-after ending. That Awkward Moment does an adequate job in both areas. The most fleshed-out of the characters Jason traverses the familiar road from ""self-centered jerk"" to ""reformed rogue willing to commit"" in a way that gets the viewer on his side. Daniel and Mikey have more perfunctory arcs and as a result their storylines are less satisfying. Zac Efron who has moved far from his Disney roots (in the 2012 film The Paperboy he had the distinction of being urinated on by Nicole Kidman) makes an appealing cad. More importantly he and Imogen Poots exhibit the mix of sugar and sparks necessary to keep That Awkward Moment rolling along. Miles Teller whose John Cusack-like persona leant an offbeat charm to last summers The Spectacular Now has some nice moments with Mackenzie Davis. Admittedly its a little disappointing to see up-and-coming actor Michael B. Jordan slide from Fruitvale Station to this where his character suffers from a chronic case of underdevelopment. Gormican uses Manhattan as more than a setting. The location is woven into the fabric of the film. This was made on location not in a Toronto neighborhood dressed up to look like Gramercy Park. Of course this isnt the real-world New York; its the romanticized movie version that tourists look for but never quite find. Similarities to Woody Allens catalog are probably not coincidental since no filmmaker has so effectively translated his affection for The Big Apple to the screen as Allen. However while That Awkward Moment falls considerably short of the heights achieved by the likes of Annie Hall and Manhattan it also avoids the potholes of some of Allens less successful New York-based productions. The salty language naked (male) buttocks and frank sexual dialogue are meant to give That Awkward Moment a more mature appeal but the movie feels like those elements were incorporated to avoid a PG-13 rating. Those hoping for a male version of Bridesmaids will be disappointed; the dirty gross material in That Awkward Moment is more superficial. Instead this will appeal primarily to those who crave the familiarity of traditional romantic comedies but arent put off by a constant barrage of f-bombs. And although the ending lacks the near perfection of ""You had me at hello"" it gets the job done. That Awkward Moment is a Valentines Day movie that arrives two weeks early.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Ann Hornaday January 30 2014 Follow AnnHornaday ""That Awkward Moment"" turns out to be unfortunately aptly named not for mining a rich vein of social and romantic anthropology as the filmmakers obviously intended to do but for so clunkily stringing together callow predictable scenes from rom-coms past. Actually make that brom-coms In this male-centric version of glossy wish fulfillment Zac Efron Miles Teller and Michael B. Jordan take center stage as three 20-ish Manhattan professionals who early in the film vow to stay single and bro-out together while they still can. The ringleader a serial one-night-stander named Jason (Efron) explains to the far more domesticated Michael (Jordan) that he needs to build a ""roster."" That is a list of women who can be called texted or sexted at any hour for a late-night booty call or other form of adult sleepover. What passes for frank and timely social observation in ""That Awkward Moment"" has less to do with edgy honesty (e.g. Adam on ""Girls"") than a shallow derivative retread (er ""Sexism in the City""?). Trying to fuse the raunch and ribaldry of Judd Apatow with the aspirational feel-goodism of the movies Matthew McConaughey no longer makes first-time writer-director Tom Gormican succeeds only in delivering a long-form sit-com of verbal and behavioral cliches from a running scatological joke featuring Tellers character to a duo of unsavory sight gags involving Efrons anatomy both real and outlandishly artificial. All is supposed to be forgiven in the course of an anticlimactic come-to-Cupid speech in which his caddish protagonist (please dont call him a hero) realizes What Relationships Are All About. With their chirpy pseudo-hip banter and super-designed faux-downscale apartments the men of ""That Awkward Moment"" rarely convince viewers that theyre more than obnoxious entitled brats running amok in the big city with way too much disposable time income and healthy liver enzymes at their disposal. Admittedly Michael proves a sensitive soft-spoken exception in a group that includes a female wingman (Mackenzie Davis) who can drink and swear and sweet-talk ladies with the best -- or worst -- of the laddies. The chief frustration of ""That Awkward Moment"" is that everyone in it is so much better than the material Efron an acting singing and dancing triple threat here squanders his charm evoking fond memories of the ""High School Musical"" movies and ""17 Again."" Teller and Jordan may not be as well known (yet) but to get a sense of the prodigious gifts they possess check out their astonishingly good performances in last years ""The Spectacular Now"" and ""Fruitvale Station"" respectively. For their part Davis and Imogen Poots -- who plays a woman so ideal that shes smart and pretty and likes Scotch and Xbox -- clearly have promising careers ahead of them after this coarse contemptuous digression. The best thing about awkward moments after all is that they usually pass quickly. And blessedly just as swiftly forgotten.  1/2 That Awkward Moment At area theaters.

MCT AP AP Focus Features That Awkward Moment    Director Tom Gormican Cast Zac Efron Michael B. Jordan Miles Teller Rated R (sexual content strong language) Running time 94 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 434pm on Thursday Jan. 30 2014 Thursday Jan. 30 2014 Thursday Jan. 30 2014 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram No doubt Tom Gormican writer/director of the rom-com That Awkward Moment would be pleased if viewers lumped his feature debut with the likes of say 500 Days of Summer an exuberant sweet 20-something love story with real heart beating beneath its humor.He certainly gets an ""A"" for effort. Gornican has corralled two of the seasons brightest up-and-coming male stars -- Michael B. Jordan ( Fruitvale Station the next Fantastic Four movie) and Miles Teller ( The Spectacular Now and this years much-admired Sundance favorite Whiplash) -- and paired them with Zac Efron a former teen heartthrob who has been trying to broaden his thespian horizons. He has put them in a story that while making a nod toward youthful raunch and bro-code bonhomie is generally a genial look at three guys dealing with issues of commitment fidelity and trust. On top of that he had the good sense to hire the underrated guitarist/composer David Torn (who has played with the likes of David Bowie John Legend Ryuichi Sakamoto and Sting) to write the shimmering electro-pop score.Not bad for a guy whose only previous film credit was as co-producer on the generally despised comedy Movie 43.Still Gormicans reach exceeds his grasp. That Awkward Moment is pleasant enough and it has some inspired moments but they dont add up to anything that pushes the boundaries of the genre.Efron and Teller are Jason and Daniel best pals and jokey co-workers at a graphic design firm specializing in book jackets. The third person in their guy trinity is Mikey (Jordan) a level-headed ER doctor.When Mikeys wife Vera (Jessica Lucas) tells him shes having an affair and wants a divorce these three decide theyve had enough of relationships and arent going to commit to one woman. But theres a catch Jason is getting serious with a girl he meets in a bar Ellie (Imogen Poots) while Daniel is starting to fall for Chelsea (Mackenzie Davis) a good friend and wingwoman whos turning into something more. As for Mikey things may not be over with his wife after all.Yes some hilarity ensues with their amorous adventures whether its dealing with the after-effects of Viagra or showing up at a ""dress-up"" party wearing the wrong thing.The cast is generally strong. Teller and Davis possess a confidence and screen presence that make you want to see what theyll do next while its good to see Jordan a mainstay in dramas get to smile occasionally. Efron is better here as the cocky but cool pretty boy than in the JFK-themed Parkland where he seemed out of his depth.What doesnt work as well is when Gormican tries to go for touching and transcendent and ends up with trite. These may be the most awkward moments of all. Cary Darling cdarlingdfw.com Twitter carydar Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

To read the whole story subscribe to BostonGlobe.com That Awkward Moment Share Comment To its credit Tom Gormicans ""That Awkward Moment"" does invert one of Hollywoods more tiresome cliches - the one where the distraught woman consoles herself by eating a pint of Ben and Jerrys ice cream. In this movie its the guy who does that. Cinema doesnt get much more groundbreaking. The unfortunate ice cream-eating male is Mikey (Michael B. Jordan) a doctor whose wife a college sweetheart has confessed to cheating on him. His freewheeling buddies Jason (Zac Efron) and Daniel (Miles Teller) see this as an opportunity to reunite the old night-prowling love-them-and-leave wolf pack. They make a pact that none of them will ever get in a relationship again. Full story for BostonGlobe.com subscribers.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""That Awkward Moment"" is a film pitched at young men hungering for a romantic comedy. Anyone still reading? The movie is a bungled mass of relationship gab and frat-friendly gross-out gags with the latter and most of the laughs front-loaded into the first few reels. Writer/director Tom Gormican who has the comedic timing of a stepped-on Swatch has crafted a ""Sex and the City""-style story of three pals in pursuit of no-commitment snogging. Jason (Zac Efron) is a rake with Gumby hair and a sensitive side. He designs book jackets with his best bud Daniel (Miles Teller) a smug ego-strutting joker. When divorce looms for their college pal Mikey (Michael B. Jordan) the trio vow to canoodle with as many ladies as possible while evading emotional entanglement. Then they meet their prospective dream girls. Theres no reason it couldnt work. The premise clicked in ""Loves Labors Lost."" But this movie is a veritable bonfire of comic possibilities all sketch-pad characters and pop-culture quips. Its approach to crafting jokes is even more casual than the three amigos approach to sex. Efron does nothing to challenge the perception that hes a handsome vacuum. You could wheel a mannequin from an American Apparel shop through his scenes with about as much effect. Teller and Jordan with outstanding earlier work on their resumes wash out as well. Gormican gives them dithering dialogue that falls far short of witty riffing. Everyone blurts as quick as they can in vain hopes that entertainment will occur. The women of the cast fare better. Imogen Poots likably plays Efrons opposite number a guys gal who drinks whiskey plays Xbox and shares his literary goals. He treats her so badly -- mistaking her for a hooker is the least of it -- you pray they wont wind up together. Mackenzie Davis exudes charisma in a misbegotten role as the boys hot-girl wingman who steers likely lookers into their clutches. When the self-amused Teller snuggling her in bed declares hes ""slumming"" you cringe rather than laugh. THAT AWKWARD MOMENT  out of 4 stars Rating R for sexual content and language throughout. The men in the cast seem aware theyre in a bad movie but soldier on regardless; the women seem determined to rescue it. The title refers to nothing particular in the story but aptly describes the conversations the actors will have with their agents this weekend. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Rated R (language sexuality) BOTTOM LINE In a textbook on romantic comedies a still from this movie could be included with the caption ""Figure 1 Wrong."" CAST Zac Efron Miles Teller Michael B. Jordan LENGTH 145 In the romantic comedy ""That Awkward Moment"" Michael B. Jordan plays Mikey a young resident at a hospital whose wife is a successful lawyer. Unfortunately theyre divorcing. ""I did what I was supposed to do"" says the shell-shocked Mikey. ""I checked the boxes."" You know this character Hes the one who did everything right yet somehow got everything wrong. As it happens thats exactly the problem with ""That Awkward Moment"" a movie that checks absolutely every box and still utterly fails the test. Mikey may be only a peripheral figure here but he turns out to be the sorry heart of this unimaginative self-limiting imitation of a Hollywood rom-com. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Who was the Sons of Anarchy Homeless Woman? Jordan a soulful presence in the hard-hitting indie film ""Fruitvale Station"" is one of several likable and talented actors in ""That Awkward Moment"" who should be grateful that audiences have seen their better work. Others include Zac Efron (""Parkland"") as Jason a supremely confident ladies man with a rotating stable of fillies and Miles Teller (""The Spectacular Now"") as Daniel the hard-partying id with no verbal filter and a high alcohol tolerance. Of the films three leads only the fast-talking Teller wrings a little humor and charm from his tiresome role. The plot hinges on the trios pact to stay single which of course doesnt last. Mikey crawls back to his adulterous wife (Jessica Lucas) Daniel crosses the friendship line with Chelsea (an appealing Mackenzie Davis) and Jason a book-cover designer quickly falls for aspiring author Ellie (Imogen Poots). The movies title which refers to the serious tipping point in every casual relationship has a snappy ring to it but bears little relation to the story lines. ""That Awkward Moment"" written and directed by Tom Gormican tries to borrow some wit and charm from its Manhattan backdrop but the more its characters talk about how special the place is the more ordinary and irritating they sound. When a brokenhearted Jason cries into his beer the obligatory barroom philosopher tells him ""Sometimes you win sometimes New York wins."" It sounds just like a line in a movie and thats the only reason its here. 228 MoviesThat Awkward Moment trailer PLOT Three men make a pact to stay single in New York City. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING R (language sexuality) CAST Zac Efron Miles Teller Michael B.

"Getting romantic with Three Night Stand and That Awkward Moment Reviews | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesGetting romantic with Three Night Stand and That Awkward Moment ReviewsCanuck indie Three Night Stand shows That Awkward Moment how to make an engaging and entertaining romcom with edge.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Jan. 30 2014Three Night StandStarring Sam Huntington Emmanuelle Chriqui Meaghan Rath and Jonathan Cherry. Directed by Pat Kiely. 92 minutes. Opens Jan. 31 at the Royal. 14AStarring Zac Efron Michael B. Jordan Miles Teller Imogen Poots and Mackenzie Davis. Directed by Tom Gormican. 94 minutes. Opening Jan. 31 at major theatres. 14A Smart and sharp-tongued homegrown indie romance Three Night Stand may be responsible for presenting the quintessential Canuck love scene.Article Continued BelowThings start out surprisingly sensual but ultimately get played for laughs with a touch of pathos as a bundled-up pair fumble through an illicit romp aboard a snowmobile.Written and directed by Pat Kiely this bedroom farce with a side of snark is fresh off screenings at the Sundance indie sidebar festival Slamdance.The action primarily takes place at a cosy bed and breakfast in the snowy Laurentians mixing it up among exes singles and marrieds.Goofily nice guy Carl (Being Humans Sam Huntington) hopes a weekend at a cosy inn will help him get back on track with Sue (stunning Meaghan Rath also of Being Human) his wife of five years. Their union is showing signs of strain.""Sex has become such a production"" Sue complains of Carls elaborate role-playing demands. ""I feel like Im in a Broadway play thats been running for three years.""Clearly they need some couple time and the snowbound forest retreat is just the ticket with a weekend of wine tastings and snuggling by the fire. Its a hot idea that cools down considerably when a shocked Carl discovers the new owner of the lodge is sexy Robyn (Entourages Emmanuelle Chriqui) his former flame.Not only is Robyn the one that got away she made off with Carls heart in the process.After clumsy attempts to keep Sue from putting two and two together fall flat Carl hopes persuading friends Stacey (Reagan Pasternak) and over-sharing husband Doug (Jonathan Cherry making the most of a comic smallish role) to drop by the inn will help deflect the potential for trouble.Things only get worse. And then there are the other guests. Ultrasmooth and boyishly handsome art-house movie actor Anatolii (Aliocha Schneider of Maman est chez le coiffeur) starts making eyes at Sue. That is when he isnt acting overly affectionate with his attractive mom Lise (The Trotskys Anne-Marie Cadieux).The cast is consistent and well up to the job of selling both the romance and the pain especially the charmingly quick Rath while Chriqui shows theres more to her than the girlfriend-of role that made her famous in Entourage.The arguments are realistic and the chemistry among the cast feels sincere even if the set-ups are occasionally contrived and the late arrival of a character doesnt work as well as hoped. What makes Three Night Stand work is Kielys willingness to occasionally let things get dark a welcome change from the constant chirpiness of typical American romantic comedies.Thats certainly evident with That Awkward Moment also opening Jan. 31 as neophyte writer-director Tom Gormican (only previous credit co-producer on Movie 43) drags the most ridiculous and cliched elements of the worst of female-centred romcoms into a male arena and calls it entertainment.Given the cast the disappointment in this ill-formed flick is made even sharper. It stars Michael B. Jordan (Fruitvale Station) as Mikey and Fruitvale Stations Miles Teller (who just wowed crowed at Sundance in Whiplash which took both jury and audience awards) as Daniel. Theyre two of the most talented young actors of the decade with long and impressive careers ahead and are desperately ill-used here.Meanwhile the best to be said of Zac Efron who plays Jason the commitment-shy lead fellow in this three-hander bromantic comedy is that he sports an ever-changing crop of facial hair.The three guys who spend an inordinate amount of time walking around Manhattans SoHo nabe drinking coffee and talking trash about women decide to form a pact to support recently separated doc Mikey. If he cant have a relationship none of them will.Enter lovely and lively Ellie (Imogen Poots) who soon tests Jasons resolve to fly solo while Daniel finds there may be more to his pal Chelsea (Mackenzie Davis) than her assigned role as his bar stool wing-woman. Mikey too has trouble keeping the hearts-on-lockdown pledge.Amid their secret struggles with temptation the guys can do no better than parrot the confessional tone of weak romcoms right down to powering through a half-litre of Haagen-Dazs and the wholly unrealistic jobs two of them have (Daniel and Jason design book jackets) while managing to support hip NYC lifestyles.Its the kind of lifestyle that only happens in the movies -- the biggest stretch since Sex and the City freelance writer Carrie Bradshaw paid for a closetful of Manolos and an endless supply of Cosmos with a weekly newspaper column.

Photo Focus Features MORE FROM Kyle Smith Indignation is an important devastating look at 50s youth Thrilling Nerve never takes its foot off the pedal Bad Moms good laughs The worst Bourne movie is still pretty good Trumps RNC speech wasnt just a success -- it was a smash hit MOVIE REVIEW That Awkward Moment Running time 94 minutes. Rated R (profanity crude humor sex scenes). At the Empire the Kips Bay the Union Square others. ""That Awkward Moment"" is a rom-com for dudes that seeks to outdo the ladies by being even more insipid formulaic and contrived than anything Katherine Heigl has ever done. Its style is equal parts lactational and locker room the only conceivable point of debate being whether its the weepy displays of affection or the witless talk of ca-ca and pee-pees that is more excruciating. As a young Manhattan book designer Zac Efron defines the films title as that point in the relationship when the girl asks ""So . . . ?"" As in ""So where is this heading?"" This is the Bat signal that supposedly tells a guy to flee because it means shes getting all icky and lovey and stuff. Jason (Efron) and his besties Daniel (Miles Teller) and Mikey (Michael B. Jordan of ""Fruitvale Station"") resolve to seize the opportunity yielded by Mikeys breakup with his wife (Jessica Lucas) to hold the ladies at bay and ""stay single"" meaning its OK to maintain a ""roster"" of women to sleep with but not to get too close to them. Immediately though both Jason and Daniel get attached to their current bonk buddies Ellie and Chelsea (Imogen Poots Mackenzie Davis). Meanwhile Mikey rekindles the flames with his own wife who required only a bit of spontaneous non-bedroom sex to smooth out their problems. This is one of those movies where the only way you can tell ""witty banter"" is meant to be taking place is that couples are smiling a lot and telling each other how funny they are while pushing banalities at each other. Only those banalities come with a side of Tourettes No one ever says ""Whats that?"" if they could be saying ""What the f - - - is that?"" And yet people keep having sex with most of their clothes on. For a self-consciously R-rated movie the love scenes could almost be rated A for ""Amish."" One couple discovers they have this charming detail in common They both like parks. Does that really narrow down the dating possibilities? Its like ""Hey you have two legs also. Were meant for each other"" And if a guy proved he was a jerk by skipping your dads funeral would you forgive him because he targeted you with a big pouffy display of embarrassing public affection? Jason -- who is shirtless an awful lot considering hes in a movie thats supposed to be for straight men -- attends a dress-up party wearing a foot-long rubber ding-dong dangling out of his crotch. The guys keep bursting in on each other during sex (then lingering for weirdly long periods) and when they get depressed they break out the Ben amp; Jerrys and wash it down with whiskey. Otherwise they pass the time gazing at one anothers naked man-parts ogling each others shoes designing chick-lit book covers or shopping for sex toys. Then they ask each other questions like ""If you were gay would you date me?"" Maybe theres a reason these guys keep coming up with silly rules designed to keep scary women at arms length and it isnt fear of commitment.

"That Awkward Moment movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies REVIEW That Awkward Moment  That Awkward Moment Nicole Rivelli/Focus Features Scene from ""That Awkward Moment."" Scene from ""That Awkward Moment."" (Nicole Rivelli/Focus Features) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune More grating than peppy the Manhattan-set romantic comedy ""That Awkward Moment"" proceeds as a series of awkward moments in search of a premise and a protagonist a little less stupid.Zac Efron bed-hops around as writer-director Tom Gormicans narrator/hero. Hes a graphic designer whose life is one long hookup interrupted by beers and shots and trash-talk and Xbox with guy friends. This lady-killer meant to be fetchingly blase on the surface and a fine fellow underneath comes off like such a pluperfect egotist you find yourself rooting for everyone but him. The casting exacerbates matters. The film stars Efron and co-stars several other youngish performers more interesting and wittier than Efron. We could start that list with Mackenzie Davis a genuine talent with unpredictable comic timing and a self-effacing quality. We could move on to Miles Teller (demeanor of a Cusack voice like Jonah Hill but with his own thing) lately of ""The Spectacular Now."" Or to Michael B. Jordan of ""The Wire"" and ""Fruitvale Station"" stuck playing a neutered tag-along to his horn-dog pals. Or to Imogen Poots the woman who shakes Efrons character out of his arrested adolescence.Gormicans gimmick goes like this. When Mikey the Jordan character gets dumped by his wife Jason (Efron) and Daniel (Teller) make a vow with Mikey to stay single and horn-doggy forever. No serious relationships But they all start falling for their respective special someones and then go to aggravating lengths to hide the fact theyre falling. The women are doormats waiting for the men to grow up or not. Its nice to see a movie in love with New York City but ""That Awkward Moment"" sets such a low bar for Jasons redemption it becomes a drag. When Jason hits rock bottom emotionally speaking he fails to show up at his sort-of-girlfriends fathers funeral. Efron does his limited earnest best to activate the drama inside the comedy while everybody else practices their throwaway technique. The best scenes belong to Davis and Teller; theyre loose and truthfully awkward as opposed to artificially so.mjphillipstribune.com""That Awkward Moment"" - 2 starsMPAA rating R (for sexual content and language throughout)Running time 134Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Entertainment Movies Jonah Hill The Spectacular Now (movie) Fruitvale Station The Wire Latest movie reviews REVIEW At Middleton  REVIEW Labor Day  Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising70deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-that-awkward-moment-0131-20140130,0,3006462.column",200,thatawkwardmoment22,thatawkwardmoment,chicagotribune

Share Tweet That Awkward Moment desperately wants to speak to a new generation of romantic-comedy devotees without proving it has the authority to do so. Its not as laboriously dumb as the overloaded ensemble rom-coms of Garry Marshall (Valentines Day New Years Eve) or the similarly star-studded Hes Just Not That Into You. But Tom Gormicans debut yearns to stand out as a benchmark for what dating is like at this moment in time all the while working with the same basic toolkit as every other film in the genre.Mikey (Michael B. Jordan) a doctor who ""checked all the boxes"" and got married at 23 comes home one day to find his wife is not only having an affair but also wants a divorce. In an effort to console their friend book-cover designers Jason (Zac Efron) and Daniel (Miles Teller) hatch a pact--one that somehow transmutes into a bet--to remain single together in solidarity. They cultivate their ""rosters"" women they hook up with but never date because dating is when the fun ends. But Jason begins to fall for Ellie (Imogen Poots) an author and Daniel starts becoming more than friends with longtime wing-woman Chelsea (Mackenzie Davis).The first sign of trouble is that Jordans plot feels airlifted in from an entirely different film more adult melodrama than goofy R-rated romantic comedy. Mikeys attempts to win back his ex-wife come off as a transparent bid for a serious subplot designed to suggest that everything might not work out in the end. Mostly though the plot hits all the expected beats. The other guys arent even close to operating on Mikeys level of commitment; theyre still worried about dating to say nothing of everlasting love or marriage. That Awkward Moment has only light whiffs of modern romance like Facebook stalking along with bizarre factual errors (like everyone calling a clearly labeled bottle of Bulleit Rye whiskey ""Scotch."")Yet Jordan Teller and occasionally Efron are beguilingly committed saving scene after scene in a movie that doesnt deserve them. They have great comedic chemistry and make limp sophomoric humor sound like believable banter among a group of 26-year-old friends. Jordan and Teller even infuse the emotional moments with the right poignancy though the script provides no assistance in laying the groundwork for those scenes. (Efron places a distant third but hes got undeniable charisma and clearly gives everything hes got.)What all three plot strands have in common is a lazy adherence to the standard movie-romance playbook--the moment someone realizes its really over this time a big redemptive speech that should never make up for an irrevocably callous and selfish act a hospital-bed reunion after an accident. That Awkward Moment gives in to them all. It squanders the rapport among three of the best young actors working today in order to follow the formula of countless genre predecessors.

While kitted out with an impressively charming cast Tom Gormicans cliched ""That Awkward Moment"" suffers from the kind of overly snippy editing that doesnt tighten up sequences or streamline character traits but the type that renders whole sequences confusing and entire characters the victim of chopped up narrative aims. Simply put - the most awkward thing about ""That Awkward Moment"" is that the majority of it just doesnt make much sense and as a relatively light-hearted spin on the romantic comedy genre it absolutely should. Gormicans feature debut (the writer and director has one other credit to his name - as a co-producer for ""Movie 43"") centers on three best friends who are all in various states of disarray over their romantic lives. The trio have been friends since college but Michael B. Jordans Mikey apparently tapped out on their running game early marrying his school sweetheart at the tender age of twenty-three. Zac Efrons Jason and Miles Tellers Daniel have run wild ever since and while the news that Mikeys marriage is ostensibly over seems vaguely upsetting to them theyre mainly just jazzed that they can pull Mikey back into their search for fresh meat. The guys come up with a plan - they will all stay single together - thats only brought back up when absolutely necessary which means that its frequently forgotten and then reclassified to meet needs. (Later in the film the pact is referred to as a bet though there are never any stakes or set time limits and theres certainly no one vying to win anything from it.) Despite the slack nature of said plan (pact bet whatever) it coyly triggers opposite responses - Jason begins falling for the wily and carefree Ellie (Imogen Poots) while Daniel and best gal pal/former wingman Chelsea (Mackenzie Davis) start up their own clandestine affair and even Mikey gets cozy with the last person he should feel endeared to. Of course all of the guys lie to each other everyone sneaks around and the outing of secrets is both wholly inevitable and oddly without tension. Choppily put together the film frequently feels as if its missing key bits of exposition and character-building and its often-jumpy transitions keep things confusing instead of allowing it to be amusing or entertaining.  A hefty number of the films characters simply dont react to things with expected or even average emotional responses - one characters wife cheats on him and he never exhibits believable signs of either anger or sadness another character allows the douchebag who skipped out on her fathers Thanksgiving Day funeral to still post cute cat videos on her Facebook page (anyone else would have unfriended the bastard) - robbing the film of even the most tenuous grasp on reality. And tenuous it is as ""That Awkward Moment"" like plenty of films of its kind doesnt adhere too closely to reality in even broad details. Jason and Daniel are book cover designers - a career path that apparently affords them spacious New York City apartments and an entirely drinkable income though their works of art dont seem especially unique or interesting. While nearly everyones apartment is far bigger than it should believably be (though Mikey and Veras place looks about right for a young career couple) it seems as if the set design team at least got a banger of a deal on ikat textiles (everyones sheets and curtains look oddly similar). Rom-coms dont generally seem to exist in ""the real world"" but ""That Awkward Moment"" willfully bucks details both big and small and the result is something oddly fake and emotionally empty. The film is laden (and leaden) with romantic comedy tropes from another eras - hooky coincidences woodenly delivered lines minor misunderstandings played for big laughs and even a final act ""big spectacle"" to show emotion - that dont rile nearly as much as the films other elements simply because theyre comforting amidst all the mish-mash. What the film does have is three highly likable male leads who have all proven their worth in other outings along with a pair of leading ladies (Poots and Davis) who have charm to spare. But the messy final product never allows things to click together even with such a talented and young cast ready to deliver what could have been an at least passable attempt at revitalizing the rom-com.

Jordan Miles Teller Imogen Poots Mackenzie DavisRated R; runtime 1 hour 34 minutes; opens Friday nationwide 13 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREThe easy camaraderie among the trio of male leads lessens the clumsiness of That Awkward Moment.The title refers to the point at which a casual hook-up may become a more serious romance. The story ( 1/2 out of four; rated R; opens Friday nationwide) is meant to venture beyond the limitations of the predictable rom-com told as it is from a slightly raunchier twentysomething male perspective. However it still adheres to most of the conventions of the genre. While it has the requisite amounts of comedy and romance its actually more of a buddy movie. Think Sex in the City bro-style.From a more cynical perspective its a Valentines Day date movie that guys wont mind seeing and women will find amusing enough and easy on the eyes.Likable lead actors Zac Efron Michael B. Jordan and Miles Teller have an appealing chemistry though the material theyre given lacks cleverness.REVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersThe alpha dog in this lovable wolf pack is Jason (Efron) who opens the film wincing as he describes the awkwardness of the moment when a woman opens a line of conversation with ""So..."" as in ""So where is this relationship going?""His buddy Daniel (Teller) agrees in theory if not in practice. He doesnt score nearly as often with the ladies or as successfully. In fact he tends to use the assistance of his female buddy Chelsea (Mackenzie Davis) to pick up girls in bars. Not surprisingly its not the most effective of tactics.Rounding out the trio is Mikey (Jordan) their more grounded pal. Hes a successful doctor whose marriage to successful lawyer Vera (Jessica Lucas) is more than on the rocks. Its hit a boulder.Some of the jokes fall flat such as a recurring gag about Daniels bathroom habit and a costume party mix-up (lifted from Bridget Jones Diary and Legally Blonde). The formulaic concept at the core of the film -- they all agree to lead unencumbered lives and enjoy a friendship like they had back in college -- feels like the sort of rom-com contrivance rife for spoofing (a la How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days or Failure to Launch).One by one they upend their vow. Even though Jason is a guy with a girl in every fashionable New York City neighborhood hes smitten by manic pixie dream girl Ellie (Imogen Poots). Daniel may seem a goofy non-starter but his friendship with Chelsea is veering into romantic territory. Michaels arc with his estranged wife is a jot less predictable.Jordan plays the most admirable character. Teller with his puppy dog affability has a natural gift for humor that rises above the limitations of the script. He deftly conveys his characters lovable vulnerability making him the one we root for most to find happiness. Efron has an easy way of making his jerky charmer more engaging than he should be.The balance between ribald comedy and sweet romance is not perfectly calibrated -- the film leans too heavily on bathroom humor -- but the guys seem to be having fun together.That Awkward Moment is featherweight fare made worth watching because of the charm of the talented leads. 13 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1eh6lyS",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/01/29/awkward-moment-review/5019543/,200,thatawkwardmoment26,thatawkwardmoment,usatoday

Or at least nowhere in particular. And finally the other person takes a breath and starts The Conversation. The conversation that almost always begins ""So..."" ""That Awkward Moment"" is what it might be called and its the name of a movie about three not-quite-30 guys who are trying to postpone that chat indefinitely. Keep it light keep it moving keep their options open. Its the movie though thats not ready to commit. It has some good actors and some quick dialogue which also has the feel of real-life. But the plot forces things a bit and the direction is uncertain; just when it seems willing to take some risks it retreats. The first problem is with the films central situation which has Michael B. Jordans wife walk out on him. So to get him back into the dating pool his buddies Zac Efron and Miles Teller swear theyre going to take things strictly casual too -- each guy will develop a ""roster"" of lovers but not one will be allowed to become a regular girlfriend. This is both a little smarmily arrogant and not quite believable -- particularly when Efron and Teller find themselves falling for their beautiful hookups. Compounding the problem is the film doesnt knit the multiple ongoing deceptions into the door-slamming farce they should become; like these guys affairs things just amble along aimlessly. Teller who was so charming in the far better romance ""The Spectacular Now"" is terrific here (although he doesnt seem old enough for the part or these friendships). Newarks Jordan so impressive in ""Fruitvale Station"" is good too as the most serious pal of the three. And while its still a little hard to take Efron too seriously in anything the female roles are particularly well cast with Imogen Poots (who has the name of a Roald Dahl heroine) a truly fresh choice as Efrons lover Ellie a gal with a bad haircut too much eyeshadow and a certain spark. The movies at its best when it just lets her be or sits back and listens as Teller -- who seems to be happily riffing on his lines -- bounces half-muttered insults and oddball jokes off his friends. But what should be the movies big setpieces -- a surprise birthday party a formal Thanksgiving feast -- never develop any layers or interesting sideshows. (Big party scenes are notoriously difficult to direct as first-time filmmaker Tom Gormican may know by now.) And for an R-rated romantic comedy theres not a lot of sex. The three men talk about it a lot (although not quite as much as they talk about masturbation or bowel movements). But nobody seems to spend much time actually doing it and when they do its under carefully draped sheets and without much humor. Thats another missed opportunity because sex is funny (or to repurpose an old Woody Allen punchline it is if youre doing it right). And although some movies (like the Justin Timberlake/Mila Kunis rom-com ""Friends With Benefits"") understood that the actual act seems to make this movie -- like its heroes -- a little uncomfortable. There are some good things here but maybe in development this movie needed an awkward moment of its own -- one where the filmmaker was taken aside by one or more older preferably female studio executives whod read him some of his script out loud. Look at him. And then say ""So..."" Ratings note The film contains sexual situations and strong language. That Awkward Moment (R) Focus (94 min.) Directed by Tom Gormican. With Zac Efron Michael B. Jordan Miles Teller.

Zac Efron wants to put his teen-idol past behind him in the most aggressive way possible. He tried fightin drinkin drivin and lovin as an unconvincing Midwestern farm boy in ""At Any Price"" and he let Nicole Kidman empty her bladder on him in ""The Paperboy."" Efron tries to up the R-rated stakes in ""That Awkward Moment"" a supposedly raunchy comedy about dudes and babes and relationships but despite his frequent near-nudity hes saddled with a particularly bland and butterscotch-hearted tale about guys who boast about being single and care-free but who deep down want to find the right girl. I was reminded of 1986s ""About Last Night"" for more than one reason this new movie borrows that earlier films observations about male-female sexual power plays yes but it also has Jim Belushi telling Rob Lowe that hes too damn pretty which is also Efrons cross to bear. (We should all have such problems.) No matter how much scruff Efron grows how much scotch he swills or how many F-bombs he drops hes still got a face like a basket of kittens. Also read That Awkward Moment Zac Efron Michael B. Jordan Miles Teller Talk Characters (Videos) And ""That Awkward Moment"" has a script like a basket of cliches hauling out the hoariest insights about romance and relationships alongside gags so shopworn (I thought you said it was a costume party) you cant believe they still exist outside of family-hour sitcoms. When young physician Mikey (Michael B. Jordan) learns that his wife has been having an affair and wants a divorce the suddenly-single MD finds himself back on the New York City prowl with his best pals from college Jason (Efron) and Daniel (Miles Teller) who work together as illustrators for chick-lit book covers. The three pledge to stay single which naturally leads to all of them finding love Jason with wide-eyed publisher Ellie (Imogen Poots whose American accent is only a tiny bit more convincing than Keira Knightleys in ""Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit"") Daniel with his longtime wing-person Chelsea (Mackenzie Davis ""Smashed"") and Mikey with his estranged wife Vera (Jessica Lucas) who seems to be perhaps warming up to her man now that hes moved out. Also read Jeff Sneider If I Had an Oscar Ballot Joaquin Phoenix Michael B. Jordan Would Be On It Had first-time writer-director Tom Gormican established that pledge as a bigger deal it would help explain why the guys jump through such hoops and act like such jerks to keep their new loves secret. But since its an agreement made in passing their vow doesnt have enough heft to excuse some really awful behavior particularly on Jason and Daniels part. The plotting issues would matter less if ""That Awkward Moment"" actually delivered on the laughs but there are few to be found. Gormicans idea of a punch line is to have a character end a scene by telling another one ""Youre an idiot"" (or ""Youre an a?hole"") which isnt just feeble writing its also not even a joke because its true. The films most distinguished feature is the cinematography by Brandon Trost (""This Is the End"" ""Crank High Voltage"") who apparently loves New York City more than the filmmaker does his characters. Also read Shirtless Zac Efron Seth Rogen Tease Bound 4 Parody (Photo) Teller (coming off of ""The Spectacular Now"" and Sundance hit ""Whiplash"") and Jordan (whose turn in last year?s ""Fruitvale Station"" put him on everyones radar) will soon be leaving this one off their distinguished resumes but if anyone comes out of ""That Awkward Moment"" unscathed its the island of Manhattan. As for Efron I remain confident that his careers current awkward moment can still give way to the movie that will make him a full-grown man on the big screen. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

TWITTER Boys will be boys as Zac Efron Miles Teller and Michael B. Jordan take on sex and the city. Resolved to remain unattached players a trio of Manhattan buddies stumble into -- gasp -- serious feelings in That Awkward Moment. Itself an awkward mix of sentiment and post-Hangover raunch the glossy rom-com retrofits the Apatovian template of emotionally stunted guydom for the twentysomething set. The wide release is primed for box-office love from younger audiences who will flock to see topliner Zac Efron and his costars both hot off breakout roles Miles Teller (The Spectacular Now) and Michael B. Jordan (Fruitvale Station). The title of writer-director Tom Gormicans debut feature refers to the point in a ""casual"" relationship when female expectations (time to step it up a notch on the commitment meter) intrude on boyish expectations (let the good times roll). But it also applies to the life stage that its bromantic characters find themselves in moving toward 30 and running scared. STORY That Awkward Moment Screening Stars Talk Challenges of Raunchy Comedy A sitcom-y pact among the three amigos forms the flimsy premise. Jason (Efron) and Daniel (Teller) who work together designing book covers in the loft offices of a downtown-chic company rally to support their doctor friend Mikey (Jordan) whos blindsided when his wife (Jessica Lucas in a woefully underwritten role) wants a divorce. In an act of solidarity with their wounded bro Jason and Daniel pledge to avoid relationship entanglements while building their ""rosters"" with one-night stands. How this is a change from their normal behavior is unclear. But what matters is that eventually theyre lying to one another about their freewheeling status and hiding deepening romantic involvements. Gormican (who has a producing credit on the gross-fest Movie 43) leans too heavily on dick jokes and the bathroom routine thats an unfortunate defining element of Tellers character instantly grows tired. In smaller sharper doses the frenetic testosterone shtick of these baby-faced blusterers might have worked better. The director handles his screenplays shifting tones in clunky fashion although a few jolts of absurdity courtesy of Josh Pais as a workplace colleague of Jasons hit the mark. VIDEO That Awkward Moment Trailer Zac Efron Strips Down Struggles to Stay Single But even when Gormicans material tries too hard to be wackily crude and not hard enough to make dramatic sense the actors suggest layers of experience that help to fill in the gaps. The central characters contradictions resonate These guys are trying to figure themselves out though their chosen method is often avoidance. Among the thin setups and the gags that fall flat there are well-played laughs and exchanges that capture something true about youthful ambition and the distancing strategy of self-irony. A standout among these exchanges is the one that brings together Jason and Ellie (Imogen Poots) at a packed bar when the wrong guy offers to buy her a drink. Although shes smart sexy and down with Scotch and Xbox Jason still retreats to booty calls with Alana (Addison Timlin) a sort-of-friend with benefits. Jason and motormouth Daniel are of the goofy immature type that prevails in contemporary American romantic comedies. And like their movie brethren they attract smart self-possessed women who arent necessarily three-dimensional. The movies two female leads Poots and Mackenzie Davis have been handed under-conceived idealized constructions; their characters purpose is to understand the misbehaving boys and to help them grow up. Yet theyre intriguing if not entirely believable. Davis is especially captivating as Chelsea whose teasing friendship with Daniel morphs into something else. Avoiding movie-girlfriend default settings she holds her own whether trading putdowns with the guys or performing a soulful number at the piano. The actors chemistry is crucial to making often idiotic behavior at least somewhat palatable. But unlike Judd Apatow Gormican doesnt insist that these boys and their growing pains are adorable. Jordans Mikey fares best sympathy-wise -- hes the most sensible of the three and the most openly vulnerable -- while Teller and Efron offer more fleeting glimpses of their characters sensitive sides. As he did in At Any Price Efron uses callowness to good effect giving his performance a conflicted edge. Jasons a good guy who can be more than a bit of a jerk and there are no excuses when he badly fumbles in another characters hour of need. Whether the characters are hanging out in their apartments crowded nightspots or bustling daytime coffee shops big-city aspiration is a key element of the story. In a production thats solid and good-looking if not distinctive Gormican DP Brandon Trost and production designer Ethan Tobman use the New York locations from trendy Lower Manhattan to upper-crust Gramercy Park to emphasize the sense of energy and possibility.

Those wondering how the newly reshuffled Focus Features will differentiate itself from its arty Oscar-garlanded predecessor need look no further than ""That Awkward Moment"" in which a couple of twentysomething dudes jacked up on Viagra school each other in the acrobatic art of urinating ""horizontally."" ""Brokeback Mountain"" its not though that is one of the better gags in tyro scribe-helmer Tom Gormicans familiar tale of three commitment-phobic New Yorkers forced to re-examine their philosophy of ""bros before hos"" when Ms. Right walks into each of their lives. The pic falls well short of its efforts to combine the raucous vulgarity of the ""Hangover"" movies with Cameron Crowe-ish depth of feeling but Gormican had the good fortune to cast one of the most interesting young actors in movies today Miles Teller and to surround him with an able-bodied cast that deserves better than most of what theyve been given. That plus the heavily advertised promise of Zac Efron in various states of undress and coitus should give ""Awkward"" a sizable moment at the February box office. Gormican begins and ends ""That Awkward Moment"" with Efrons Jason sitting alone and forlorn on a bench in Gramercy Park on a chilly winters night and in between flashes back to show us how he got there. Its a story that involves so many staggeringly selfish and stupid decisions (even by romantic-comedy standards) that at a certain point it becomes impossible to muster the slightest concern for the character and whether hell ever find true love or simply keep chasing tail all the way into the nursing home. (The ""moment"" of the title is said to be the one where a relationship either falls apart or advances to the next more serious level -- which is precisely when Jason tends to call it quits.) In one of those fantasy movie jobs that seems to provide for unusually spacious Manhattan apartments and reams of J. Crew couture Jason works together with best bud Daniel (Teller) as in-demand book-jacket designers while third musketeer Mikey (Michael B. Jordan) inhabits a slightly realer world as a doctor who as the movie opens has just been dumped by his wife (Jessica Lucas) for another man. Taking a page from those bromantic horndogs of Shakespeares ""Loves Labours Lost"" the three friends swear off any serious entanglements with the fairer sex for the foreseeable future heeding Jasons advice of keeping a ""roster"" of friends with benefits to be called upon for guilt-free hookups. All of which is well and good until Jason meets his Princess of Aquitaine in the form of Ellie (Imogen Poots) a lit-world fellow traveler whom he initially mistakes for a high-class hooker. (No satire on the cutthroat machinations of the publishing industry seems intended.) Around the same time Daniel starts to feel something like love for his longtime platonic gal-pal Chelsea (Mackenzie Davis) while Mikey tries to patch things up with his ex -- all in secret of course lest ""the guys"" find out about it. The three leads have an affable easygoing chemistry. Efron isnt asked to do much more here than prance around in his skivvies and when his insensitive-jerk behavior catches up to him look like a doleful puppy dog whos been left out in the rain; but as skivvy-prancing rain-soaked puppy dogs go one could certainly do worse. Jordan who made such a forceful impression in ""Chronicle"" and last years ""Fruitvale Station"" has the least developed role complete with an unfunny running gag about his discolored penis. But its Teller who really kicks things up a notch whenever hes onscreen especially in his scenes together with newcomer Davis whos very good at playing the kind of self-deprecating girl-next-door whos always been better at hanging out with guys than cozying up to them. Teller (""Project X"" ""The Spectacular Now"") may be the least ironic or postmodern actor under 30 in movies today and even though hes cultivated a persona of the fast-talking joke-telling wiseass who never takes things seriously theres an underlying sweetness and sincerity to his work that shows us how all that bluster is just his characters defense against a profound fear of getting too close. As director Gormican has a decent sense of visual storytelling and a good feel for New York locations but he doesnt really know how to build a scene rhythmically and the movies third-act attempt at a big farcical Thanksgiving Day setpiece falls desperately flat. As a writer hes loaded up his debut script with dated pop-culture references (Bridget Jones really?) and strains repeatedly for those Crowe/James L. Brooks moments in which a character seemingly ad-libs some poetic monologue rife with insights about life and love. Only when Gormicans characters do this what they have to say wouldnt make the cut at American Greetings. Teens and twentysomethings who possess even less life experience and emotional maturity than these characters may find profundity in some of this. All others need not apply.

Not all of them have risen to the challenge. For instance it would take an overnight search party to find a decent gag in That Awkward Moment in which Zac Efron Michael B Jordan and Miles Teller star as back-slappin bromancin buddies who make a pact to stay single. Under their new rules its strictly verboten to see the same girl more than twice a week. The actors - who seem to have been involved in a hideous industrial accident thats left them with the superpower of repelling all comic timing - are spectacularly unfunny. Not realising it poor lambs they look pretty pleased with themselves all doing their best Vince Vaughn smirks. Smuggest and smirkiest is Efron who - and the literary greats will kick themselves for missing this diamond of a comedy-of-errors plot - mistakes his date for a hooker. Later in the film Efron wonders if he should go to the funeral of the same girls dad but worries If I do then were dating. The script tries very hard with boys-on-the-toilet gags while awkwardly and half-heartedly trying to bolt on a romcom for wives and girlfriends. But never mind the bathroom jokes this ones a stinker through and through.

Imogen Poots is an absolute star her deep voice imperfect smile and ocean blue eyes make her irresistible. Finally as a girl whos only friends with gay men or girls it was useful to get an insight on mens reactions when they first start dating.

Its a dire feeble attempt at a film about an annoying ahole who happens to have a stupid haircut and no redeeming features. As he is played by a Producer of the film and the main star we are encouraged to try to like him. He sleeps with a number of women while trying to stay aloof and away from relationships. All of the women in real life would have far too much common sense to have anything to do with him. A film about guys in their late 20s acting like they are still teenagers. It ends with a trite annoying scene where the lead comes to the conclusion that he has been a fool and that he does love the woman he let down badly and seeks to regain her trust and love. A scene done much better in most other films.
