An animated combo of the old Bob Hope-Bing Crosby ""Road"" pictures and ""The Man Who Would Be King"" DreamWorks third major feature cartoon ""The Road to El Dorado"" is a strained and pallid concoction that wont fire the collective imaginations of modern children. The automatic kidpic audience will turn out for this high-pedigree production but lack of a story that pre-teens will find involving and six of the least memorable songs Elton John and Tim Rice have written will make this only a moderate earner one certainly destined for lower B.O. than the studios ""Antz"" and ""The Prince of Egypt"" and more likely to reach the numbers of ""Anastasia"" or less. Five years in production epic buddy picture went through two sets of directors and numerous evolving concepts arriving finally at a middle ground between outright romp and a serious take on the arrival of the conquistadors in the New World. Subject matter is rife with possibilities even for a moppet-oriented effort that obviously isnt going to grapple with such heavy themes as conquest and subjugation. ""Pocahontas"" showed that it is possible to tread this sensitive terrain with a degree of balance and sensitivity in terms that kids can grasp. But whenever ""El Dorado"" threatens to get serious it backs off retreating into loud shenanigans between its two mischievous heroes complete with annoyingly anachronistic mannerisms such as high-fiving and shouts of ""Yes""; vampy scheming on the part of its heroine who looks and sounds like a Las Vegas tart; rambunctious action sequences and montage-oriented musical numbers that tend to center on general concepts (""The Trail We Blaze"" ""Its Tough to Be a God"") rather than on immediate emotions. First quarter-hour introduces dark-haired Tulio (voiced by Kevin Kline) and blond-maned Miguel (Kenneth Branagh) as Spanish rascals who delight in creating scrapes and extricating themselves with devilish aplomb. After one prank too many however they find themselves trapped in barrels and placed aboard one of Cortes ships headed across the Atlantic in 1519. With Cortes noble horse they escape in a lifeboat and finally wash up on a beautiful beach bordered by jungle. Quickly captured by imposing bronze-skinned natives the boys think their goose is cooked upon arrival at the fabled city of gold El Dorado. But the coming of such ""gods"" as they are perceived to be has been prophesied and after a bit of lucky shuffling and hocus-pocus Tulio and Miguel are installed in exclusive quarters atop one of the citys many pyramids. Local babe Chel (Rosie Perez) is on to their game and blackmails the flummoxed pair into including her in their plan to escape El Dorado with a bounty of gold courtesy of a large boat to be built especially for them. Although there is a local chief (Edward James Olmos) he along with the rest of the community is dominated by high priest Tzekel-Kan (Armand Assante) a commanding figure who pays elaborate homage to the white strangers at first but gradually becomes skeptical of their presumed divinity. The severe holy man is especially offended by the newcomers oh-so-sensitive objections to human sacrifice first when they prevent an execution and later after the ""gods"" manage to win a furious ball game and then insist that the losers contrary to custom be spared. In a direct lift from the film ""The Man Who Would Be King"" Tzekel-Kan realizes that the visitors are just human beings after all when Miguel bleeds from a cut. Far too much time is devoted to the two charlatans silly arguments about if and how theyre going to pull off their charade and to contretemps concerning Chel whom they declare to be off-limits romantically but who manages to come between them nevertheless. By contrast one of the scripts more promising elements -- Miguels sudden surge of feeling for the local citizens and their gentle lifestyle when he mingles with them to the consternation of his anxious partner -- is given unduly short shrift. Even if ""the allure of the primitive"" reps a cliche in the adventure/exploration genre a bit more time devoted to it would have brought the setting and its inhabitants more to the foreground; as it is there is no individuation among the native people. Kline and Branagh (last paired in ""Wild Wild West"") give boisterous spirited readings to their characters even if Ted Elliott and Terry Rossios script provides them with few shadings or interesting traits. Assante registers strongly as the powerful priest. But the Chel character is so contemporary and in a vulgar way to boot as to be incredible and off-putting and Perezs urbanite voicing doesnt help. Even Chels motivation is unbelievable El Dorado is presented as a Shangri-La-like paradise and no one in this sealed-off city would even know about another place to which he or she would want to flee. Visual design as overseen by directors Eric ""Bibo"" Bergeron and Don Paul is colorful sometimes attractive but never breathtaking. Animation compositions and editing favor dramatic angles and fluidly changing perspectives that keep things interesting while the characters are more commonly conceived; a few elements notably the gold are rendered with near-photographic realism. The animals on view comprehendingly participate in human endeavors but arent anthropomorphized in traditional Disney fashion while the tunes are vigorous and well sung but at least at first listen not catchy or distinctive.

Voices of Kevin Kline Kenneth Branagh Rosie Perez Armand Assante Edward James Olmos. Music by Elton John lyrics by Tim Rice. Directed by Eric ""Bibo"" Bergeron and Don Paul. (PG. 83 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Theres a certain mechanical lets-be-witty-as-all-heck feeling to the new animated feature ""The Road to El Dorado"" opening today. Contrived songs by Elton John and lyricist Tim Rice add little magic. Still this film loaded with repartee and an appealing mythical tone is colorful and pleasing to the eye. Most of the stunts are aimed at entertaining children but a centerpiece romance is surprisingly suggestive for family cartoon fare. That and an oversized monster accounts for the PG rating. In the buddy-style adventure two con men stumble upon the New World with treasure map in hand and wend their way to the legendary city of gold sought by Cortez. They get caught up in political intrigues there and one buddy finds romance with a seductive young woman. Half of the film is brisk and fun but the remainder seems muddled and predictable as a Saturday morning cartoon. Taking a page from ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" the lead characters are funny swashbucklers Tulio (voice of Kevin Kline) and Miguel (Kenneth Branagh) specialists in impromptu but elaborate con games. They wind up as stowaways aboard Cortezs brig but with help -- from a horse Altivo make a daring escape and wash up on New World shores. Finding the city of gold theyre proclaimed to be gods by the high priest Tzekel-Kan (Armand Assante) who is plotting to grab power from the kindly tribal chief (Edward James Olmos). The flirty Chel (Rosie Perez) seems equally interested in riches and sex and she seduces Tulio leaving Miguel to mingle with the natives fall in love with the culture and discover how the peasants are being manipulated. The film written by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio makes a valiant attempt to keep the white-men-as-gods theme politically correct and amusing. The animation is handsome but hardly stirring. The dense rain forests are painted in often gorgeous tones and the city of gold is made of carved-rock temples set in lush jungle. But it all comes across as disconcertingly inorganic. ..

Theyre also a little like Mel Gibson and Danny Glover on a ""Lethal Weapon"" outing Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid Timon and Pumbaa or countless other second-banana comedy duos who work the crowd before and after the hero sings a tenor aria in Disney musicals. Theyre Everybuddies. Only this time theyre the main attraction theyre DreamWorks creations - and theyre nobuddy special just a couple of talkative guys with modern never-grow-up sensibilities mildly embarrassed by the old-fashioned swashbuckling required of them. Taking off from the classic legend of a lost South American city of gold populated with gentle natives uncorrupted by their own wealth this ""Road"" is a path never meant to be traveled by a couple of harmless Spanish con men - con boys really - for whom nothing matters much besides their pleasure in each others company. Theres also a cupcake of course who comes between the two amigos as women often try to do in this formula Chel (Rosie Perez) in the Dorothy Lamour role (and for emphasis in a sarong) is wise to the newcomers scam but willing to help them provided theyll take her too. Personal growth takes place - as Chief could probably explain - when each man recognizes and accepts his individual destiny within a larger society. Songs are slotted in - as Jeffrey Katzenberg could probably explain - to describe otherwise inexpressible inner feelings in this case in wash-and-wear music by Elton John and Tim Rice the ""Lion King"" dream team. The road song is called ""The Trail We Blaze."" The joke song is ""Its Tough to Be a God."" The boy-boy love song is ""Friends Never Say Goodbye."" The tunes are interchangeable. Tulio and Miguel have been given the faces and physiques of traditional animated heroes then stretched and exaggerated - Tulio with a long Ben Affleck head and a soul patch Miguel with hints of Jesus (in the hair) Peter Gallagher (in the eyebrows) and Maynard G. Krebs (in the bebop goatee). The two enjoy roughhousing and bathing together as well as provoking each other with limp taunts (""You fight like my sister"") that cry out for exquisite delivery from stars Kline and Branagh something summoning up the abandon of Robin Williams or Nathan Lane. Over-the-edge Kline in ""A Fish Called Wanda"" and beyond-the-pale Branagh in ""Wild Wild West"" would do well too. But this trip down ""The Road to El Dorado"" proceeds under the speed limit all the way. Our Tulio and Miguel arent big enough nor strong enough nor funny enough to buckle any swashes. Theyre as lost to us as the lost city into which they stumble.
