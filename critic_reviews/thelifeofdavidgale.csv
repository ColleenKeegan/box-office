"The cruel and unusual Life of David Gale. Slate Sign In Sign Up The cruel and unusual Life of David Gale. The cruel and unusual Life of David Gale. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.March 3 2003 926 AM Flip the Switch The Life of David Gale makes the electric chair seem humane. By David Edelstein Which one is the victim here? Maybe neither Its often said of movie critics that were jaded creatures calloused from all the cinematic assaults that were forced to endure. But in fact were not much good unless we manage to stay open and receptive to what we see--to all of it from the high crap to the low art. I cry all the time at bad soap operas. I laugh like a baboon at puerile slapstick. I put my hands over my face during acts of screen violence--or whenever someone sticks a needle in someones arm even. I am a very very sensitive soul. Im rationalizing like mad to excuse having chickened out of seeing The Life of David Gale (Universal) the Alan Parker anti-death penalty movie that opened last week. I just couldnt bear to put myself through it. Parker has been responsible for some of the worst cinematic battering-rams of our time After Oliver Stones Natural Born Killers (1994) which belongs in some special circle of hell I can think of no more contemptible piece of filmmaking than Parkers self-proclaimed tribute to the Civil Rights movement Mississippi Burning (1988). Forget--if you can--that the African-Americans were pushed off to the sidelines to make way for the white FBI heroes. The more philosophical outrage was that Parker took the most successful non-violent resistance movement since Gandhi and made it fodder for a vigilante movie--a coarse thumping melodrama about the ways in which noble ends justify barbaric means. There were actors I wanted to see in The Life of David Gale but the mere prospect of more liberal politics wedded to more fascist film techniques was a threat to my fragile constitution. Advertisement This week was a slow one for openings however and I got a very flattering e-mail from a reader named Elizabeth Chadwick who had seen David Gale and asked if I could apply my ""superior intellect"" to the question of ""why the film got made."" She added that all she got from the movie was that there are ""crazy mixed-up people on both sides of the death penalty question."" I havent read a lot of the negative reviews but its rare to find the normally judicious lucid and indefatigably liberal Roger Ebert in a semi-coherent froth. Maybe it was time to see The Life of David Gale. Id just seen Gaspar Noes Irreversible a film already notorious for its protracted scenes of rape and murder. Id had a beer and a shot of whiskey. I figured I could handle Alan Parker whatever he threw at me. The verdict? Sorry Elizabeth it would take an intellect far superior to mine to explain the rationale--or for that matter the release--of David Gale. But it certainly wasnt as torturous as Id feared. In fact I hooted all the way through it. All that was missing was the little Mystery Science Theater silhouettes under the screen making cracks about the heroines car--one of those junk-heaps engineered to break down only in the event of a last-second rush to the scene of an execution with a piece of exonerating evidence--or the ominous shots of barbed-wire fences and heavy locks meant to make you cringe at the horror of a maximum-security prison having er security. Kate Winslet plays one of those reporters who only has conversations while hurtling down corridors. Her name is Bitsy. Three days before his scheduled execution she is summoned to the cell of David Gale one of those tenured philosophy professors and outspoken critics of capital punishment who always manage to land on Death Row in Texas (which the governor points out helpfully is not France or Germany). When I heard the title of the movie it hit me that David Gale was the name of the late actor who in the great 1985 splatter flick Re-Animator played a mad scientist who did X-rated things with his own severed head. Kevin Spaceys character enthused over Re-Animator in American Beauty (1999) Was this the life of that David Gale? Alas its not. This David Gale plans to tell Bitsy his life story and in so doing break through her much-ballyhooed ""journalistic objectivity."" Hes the nice Hannibal Lecter. Gale knows shes in for a wild ride ""This is not going to be easy Bitsy."" Sure enough she is soon being followed by a man in a 10-gallon hat who listens to Puccini in his pickup. Who knows what madness lurks in the minds of opera-crazed cowboys? There is really no way to address the larger insanity of The Life of David Gale without giving away the surprise ending--a surprise only by virtue of its idiocy. Fair warning? Here goes The nerdy professor (Laura Linney) was dying of leukemia anyway so she and the Cowboy and David Gale rigged her kinky rape and murder to make Gale into a death-penalty martyr. When the truth is revealed to her Bitsy does not say ""What a bunch of fruitcakes."" Her eyes fill with tears at the noble logic of it all. As Ive implied this is a great midnight movie I enjoyed every patchily edited ham-fisted scene. But I dont like seeing the wonderful Kate Winslet look stupid or the wonderful Laura Linney abase herself. And I was depressed to realize once again that the greatest danger to liberalism isnt the likes of Rush Limbaugh or Andrew Sullivan but blowhards like Alan Parker and Michael Moore--the thugs of humanism. Given the way in which its administered I dont support the death penalty for people. But I emphatically support it for certain careers. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

HANDOUT PHOTO/VERIFY RIGHTS AND ... more Photo HANDOUT Lack of mystery undermines David Gale / Muddled treatise on death penalty 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Life of David Gale Drama. Starring Kevin Spacey Kate Winslet and Laura Linney. Directed by Alan Parker. (R. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) We experience movies in the moment but a thriller can be judged only in retrospect. ""The Life of David Gale"" Alan Parkers thriller that takes on the death penalty strings an audience along and holds reasonable interest for the length of its running time. But by the end it reveals itself as too pat too absurd and -- as a polemic against capital punishment -- philosophically self- defeating. So what we have here isnt so much an intelligent movie as an intelligent effort with talented actors gamely trying in what must have seemed like a worthy project. The casting is a little odd but interesting Kate Winslet as an American journalist Laura Linney as a schoolmarmish activist and Kevin Spacey definitely reaching beyond his sardonic controlled persona as a philosopher with a reckless drunken streak. When we meet Spacey hes on the other side of a bulletproof window in one of Texas maximum-security prisons awaiting execution in 72 hours for the rape and murder of a colleague. Is he a mild fellow or is he Keyser Soze? With Spacey one can never be too sure. So it seems a waste of Spaceys delightfully unreadable passivity that Parker and screenwriter Charles Randolph dissipate any mystery about the protagonists guilt or innocence in the movies first minutes. ""The Life of David Gale"" is told in flashback as the condemned man recites his life story to Bitsy (Winslet) a hard-driving reporter for a major East Coast newsmagazine. Winslets way of playing an American is to act very alert and very angry a sort of Bette Davis on amphetamines. Her approach is hardly accurate but its fun to watch rather like Kenneth Branaghs flamboyant flings at American roles. In flashback we see Gale in his earlier life as a philosophy professor at a Texas university and as an anti-death penalty activist working side by side with Constance (Linney) the earnest young woman hed eventually be convicted of killing. Gale is popular and gifted but hes also an out-of-control drinker in a loveless marriage. And after an incident with a seductive female student his life begins to unravel. The unraveling might have been a lot more compelling if the audience were wondering ""Did he or didnt he?"" But with that question answered from the beginning theres nothing to watch but the slowly unfolding spectacle of a mans downfall -- when were much more interested in the murder mystery. No one is better than Spacey at playing cold disdain or beleaguered resentment but ""The Life of David Gale"" takes him out of his familiar modes and not always with success. A scene in which he staggers drunk along the street spouting facts and anecdotes about the ancient Greeks feels like an actorly turn not an authentic moment. And theres something positively weird about the way Spacey plays the father of a small child. Spacey doesnt act familiar around the boy but manically cheerful as though he just met the kid doesnt like him and wants to conceal that fact from the parents. Throughout ""The Life of David Gale"" the audience is starved for information about the murder and hungers for it but when we ultimately see where the movie is heading its a disappointment -- a violation of what weve come to know about the characters. As the investigative journalist Winslet is the vehicle through which the story unfolds but she cant make sense of it. Its too ridiculous. Indeed so is Winslets forced transition from hard-as-nails to sensitive-as-nails When she suddenly starts weeping or shrieking every other scene it becomes funny. Linney manages not to be cloying as the noble Constance but the movie leaves a crucial gap in the delineation of her character. By the end everything is meticulously explained and accounted for but nothing makes emotional sense. Worst of all a movie that promised to make a cogent statement about capital punishment ends up delivering a muddled and even contradictory message. - This film contains nudity strong language sexual situations and one gruesome death scene.

"CNN.com - Review A deadly Life of David Gale - Feb. 21 2003 The Web CNN.com Home Page World U.S. Weather Business Sports Politics Law Technology Science amp; Space Health Entertainment Travel Education Special Reports SERVICES Video E-mail Newsletters CNNtoGO SEARCH Web CNN.com Review A deadly Life of David Gale Overwrought drama from Spacey Parker By Paul ClintonCNN Reviewer Kevin Spacey plays a college professor and anti-death penalty activist on death row in ""The Life of David Gale."" Story Tools VIDEO CNNs David Matthews talks to Kevin Spacey and Laura Linney about The Life of David Gale a film that deals with the politically explosive issue of the death penalty. (February 20) PLAY VIDEO RELATED  David Gale cast on life and death  EW.COM Review Life of David Gale self-righteous (CNN) -- Alan Parkers turgid new drama ""The Life Of David Gale"" leaks cynicism like acid rain. Kevin Spacey plays the title character an anti-death penalty advocate who -- when we first meet him -- is on Texas death row after being found guilty of raping and murdering a fellow activist Constance Hallaway played by Laura Linney. Kate Winslet plays a magazine reporter with the unfortunate name of Bitsey Bloom who has been assigned to interview Gale in the days leading up to his execution. The film flashes back and forth between the present and the time when the murder actually took place. All of Spaceys and Winslets scenes take place behind thick glass in the prisons visiting room a la ""Silence of the Lambs."" All of Spaceys scenes with Linney take place in the past when he was a part-time activist and a full-time hard-drinking philosophy professor at an Austin university. In one scene we find Gale on television debating with the governor of Texas over the issue of the death penalty. This ""fictional"" governor who is ""in touch with in inner frat boy"" is such a parody of a certain resident of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. that Parker might as well have tattooed ""George W"" on the actors (Michael Crabtree) forehead. Message no message Slowly we find out that Gales life unraveled after he was falsely accused of raping a grad student. His wife and child left him and he was laid off from his job. Even his fellow activists found him too hot to handle and cut him loose. Kate Winslet is a reporter pursuing Gales story. At this point his only friend is Hallaway -- who is suddenly diagnosed with cancer. What else can happen? How about Hallaway is found dead and Gale is accused and convicted of her murder. Next stop death row. Oh the irony. Texas top protester against the death penalty is now a ""dead man walking."" Is he innocent? Is he guilty? Was he framed? As Gale himself says in the film ""Oh its more than that."" And it is. Its also a whole lot less. Alan Parker cant make up his mind for or against left or right. Hes made a message movie with no message. The film does make the point that innocent people are sent to death; unfortunately that point is muted when ""The Life of David Gale"" turns into a snuff video. Wherever you stand on the death penalty issue you wont find a leg to stand on in this film. Parker and screenwriter Charles Randolph throw plausibility to the wind at every turn and every emotional moment feels contrived. Ultimately it all feels like a self-righteous diatribe signifying nothing. Whats with Kevin Spacey? Which brings us to Spacey. There is no doubt this man is one of Americas finest actors just look at ""The Usual Suspects"" (1995) ""L.A. Confidential"" (1997) or ""American Beauty"" (1999). But lately his choices have been bizarre to say the least. ""Pay It Forward"" (2000) and ""K-PAX"" (2002) were dreadful emotionally manipulative films. Now hes once again chosen a seemingly ambivalent central character at the gooey center of a gooey movie with a gooey premise. Where is that towel when you need it? Linney and Winslet are also truly gifted actors and you can see how their characters may have looked good on paper. Sadly the transition from page to screen isnt pretty. ""The Life of David Gale"" aspires to be Greek tragedy but ends up as a soap opera with no soap. ""The Life of David Gale"" opens nationwide on Friday February 21.

But his life as depicted on film feels virtually endless. The makers of The Life of David Gale work hard to convince the audience of Gales idealistic nature as well as his human frailties. In fact they work too hard. The emphasis on his weaknesses becomes melodramatic and maudlin. The simple lesson imparted here is that capital punishment is wrong Innocent people can be executed. But the movie is far more compelling when its in thriller mode than when it attempts to be a morality play. David Gale (Kevin Spacey) a popular philosophy professor at a Texas college belongs to an organization that opposes the death penalty. Hes joined in the cause by friend and fellow academic Constance Harraway (Laura Linney). Review of the movie The Life of David Gale ( out of four) Stars Kevin Spacey Kate Winslet Laura Linney Gabriel Mann Director Alan Parker Rating R for violent images nudity language and sexuality Opens Friday nationwide Gale has a young son whom his estranged wife whisks away to Spain after the professor succumbs to the sultry charms of a student and is charged with rape. Charges are dropped but he falls into alcoholic debauchery and loses his job. Then it gets worse Hes convicted of Constances rape and murder and ends up on death row. He grants a jailhouse interview three days before his scheduled execution to a tough reporter (Kate Winslet) who dedicates herself to figuring out who really killed Constance. Those twists and turns are the films best scenes. Director Alan Parker uses the same overbearing touch in David Gale that he did in Angelas Ashes and Mississippi Burning He over-accentuates the pathos. Whenever a revelation is made or the suspense peaks the music swells to a deafening pitch. Parker also makes an annoying stylistic choice Before each thematic segment emotions to be tackled are introduced in title form with words such as ""lust"" and ""desire"" accompanied by a booming drumbeat. Although the main performances have moments of subtle ferocity each also plummets into melodrama. Winslet emits wracking sobs which are supposed to be all the more moving given her reporters usual reserve. But they feel contrived. Linney makes an impassioned speech that seems like overkill She already had convinced viewers of her commitment to the cause. But the most over-the-top moments are reserved for Spacey. In one particularly cliched scene the brilliant Harvard grad and Rhodes scholar who engages in televised debates with the governor of Texas careens drunkenly around the city babbling stentoriously and shouting epithets about Plato. We get it He has hit rock bottom. Unfortunately he hits rock bottom several times throughout the movie. Soon the audience feels its own sense of despair -- for a movie that might have worked but didnt.

A generation or two ago pictures like ""Z"" ""All the Presidents Men"" and ""The China Syndrome"" hit a populist nerve. They came at you with a muckraking urgency that felt as timely - as vital to the cultural dialogue - as the issues they raised. No longer. Youd have to go back a dozen years to Oliver Stones ""JFK"" to find a movie that exerted that kind of raw topical impact. Theres an explanation for the decline - apart that is from the sheer pompous and trivializing demagoguery of potboilers like ""The Siege"" or last years evil-HMOs-made-easy expose ""John Q."" In a reality-based infotainment culture where even the most pivotal news events are hyped into a kind of nightly hot-button theater it can seem cornier and more false than ever to stuff a meaty political issue into the sausage casing of Hollywood melodrama. The Life of David Gale is a fictional tale that purports to be an impassioned howl of protest against the death penalty. From the outset you can see that director Alan Parker and screenwriter Charles Randolph think theyre on to something major by the way they inflate even the most minute aspects of their story into pointed ""statements."" When Bitsey Bloom (Kate Winslet) a crusading reporter for News magazine is assigned to interview David Gale (Kevin Spacey) a defrocked college professor who has three days left on death row before his scheduled execution she can hardly get out of the office without taking a gratuitous poke at sexism in the media. In prison she meets Gale who is introduced as if he were Kevin Spaceys bid to take over the role of Hannibal Lecter. In extended flashback Gale relates how he was a charismatic hard-drinking philosophy scholar at a university in Austin whose career was derailed by a brief debauched dalliance with a femme fatale grad student. For a while we think were watching a parable of the age of sexual correctness a campus-set ""Disclosure."" But Gale it turns out was also one of the leaders of a local anti-death-penalty group and so was Constance (Laura Linney) the dowdy leukemia-stricken militant hes accused of raping and killing. Spacey who seems to have entered a new era of bad hair is the right actor to play a tormented academic star; he makes the most of Gales haughty idealism as well as his drunken descent. I wont give away the big twists which grow more ludicrous by the minute but I will reveal that ""The Life of David Gale"" is a self-righteous mishmash that cant decide whether to be a tribute to the fanatical leftist passion that thrives in college towns an indictment of that very same fanaticism or a ghoulishly didactic snuff-video thriller. To its credit the film roots its case in the compelling and timely argument that an unacknowledged percentage of death-row inmates are in fact innocent. Its particular scenario of injustice however signifies little beyond a readiness to tie plausibility into the most tangled of knots. Wherever you stand on the death penalty there ought to be a law against a message movie this contrived.

Alan Parkers passionate adaptation of first-time screenwriter Charles Randolphs yarn about a young reporters relationship with a death row inmate in Texas punches the expected buttons without being entirely convincing. A heart-on-its-sleeve anti-capital punishment pic ""The Life of David Gale"" espouses the kind of liberal sentiments once the trademark of Stanley Kramer. Alan Parkers passionate adaptation of first-time screenwriter Charles Randolphs yarn about a young reporters relationship with a death row inmate in Texas punches the expected buttons without being entirely convincing. Convoluted plotting some of it seemingly inspired by Fritz Langs noirish 1956 ""Beyond a Reasonable Doubt"" is likely to underwhelm mainstream audiences especially domestically. Pic could open decently thanks to strong performances by Kevin Spacey and a dramatically slimmed-down Kate Winslet but word-of-mouth will probably be as lethal as the doses Texas gives condemned murderers. Abroad and especially in Europe prospects will be distinctly better making the decision to launch the film at the Berlin Film Festival a wise one. Parker a strong anti-capital punishment advocate has explored hot-button American justice issues before notably with ""Mississippi Burning"" (1988) about the Civil Rights movement and ""Come See the Paradise"" (1989) about the incarceration of Japanese-Americans during WWII. Despite his anger and commitment however Parker fails to come up with a pic as strong as films like ""I Want to Live"" and ""Dead Man Walking."" Parker opens with a striking and at first puzzling scene set in barren farming countryside. In the distance a car grinds to a halt on a road and a young woman gets out and starts running very fast. The meaning of this sequence isnt revealed until near the end of the film. The woman turns out to be Bitsey Bloom (Winslet) top reporter for the NYC-based magazine ""News"" and described by one character as ""Mike Wallace with PMS."" Bloom has just served seven days behind bars for contempt of court after refusing to reveal her sources for a story on kid porn. Now shes been asked to interview an Austin prisoner David Gale (Spacey) the former head of philosophy at Austin U. and a prominent member of Deathwatch a non-profit anti-death penalty group. Gales about to be executed for the 1994 rape and murder of Constance Harraway (Laura Linney) who had been the local leader of Deathwatch. Blooms interviews are to be conducted Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday; Gale is to die at 6 p.m. on Friday. Her magazine has agreed to pay half a million dollars in cash to Gales attorney for the interviews. Bloom and intern Zack Stemmons (Gabriel Mann in the sort of thankless sidekick role usually given to young actresses) head for Huntsville Texas in a rented car that seems to be overheating. (Screenwriter memo Wouldnt they get a replacement car at the first opportunity? They dont of course because the overheating auto will play a key role later in the movie.) After the usual preliminaries with the seen-it-all prison warden and with Gales avuncular but none-too-bright pony-tailed attorney Braxton Belyeu (Leon Rippy) Bitsey is introduced to the condemned man. Gale it turns out is a Rhodes scholar author of two books on philosophy son of a former ambassador to Spain. Bulk of the pic is divided into three sets of lengthy flashbacks which cover the three interviews; these interviews are bookended by some flashy but rather pointless mini-montages involving wildly tilted camera angles and quick shots of ""significant"" words like Pain Honor Self-Sacrifice. At the start of the flashbacks Gale is seen teaching a class and afterward fending off the advances of pert student Berlin (Rhona Mitra) who clearly has the hots for him. Since his wife Sharon (Elizabeth Gast) is frequently visiting Barcelona where she appears to have a lover the lonely Gale gets to spend plenty of time with Constance with whom he plans political strategies. But one night at a party the drunken Gale is trapped in a bathroom by Berlin and succumbs to her not inconsiderable charms; afterward she cries rape and though the charges are later dropped his career is ruined. Gale takes to the bottle. Meanwhile in the present Bloom and Zack are followed by a mysterious guy in a cowboy hat and discover a vidcassette left in Blooms motel room which leads her to believe someone else killed Constance. Pic becomes a race against time to save the condemned man once Bloom and Zack come across startling new evidence but a climactic series of revelations are not only unconvincing but confusing. Parker takes his time to tell the crusading story. Though he never passes up an opportunity to reveal figures about crime and punishment in America (were told 73% of serial killers vote Republican) his attempts to fashion Randolphs screenplay into a nail-biting thriller dont succeed. And no opportunity is passed up by composers Alex and Jake Parker (the directors sons) to add to the mood with less-than-subtle music effects; indeed the music score is one of the films major failures. Spacey effectively portrays the decline and fall of a caustic intellectual while Winslet acquits herself nobly as the cynical newspaperwoman who comes to believe the condemned man is innocent. In flashback Linney gives the films strongest performance as the activist whose own demons come to haunt her. Many of Parkers long-time collaborators including d.p. Michael Seresin editor Gerry Hambling and production designer Geoffrey Kirkland provide sterling contributions to the technically proficient pic.
