"London Has Fallen - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire London Has Fallen Posted by Christy Lemire on March 14 2016 32 Comments Gramercy Pictures Rated R for strong violence and language throughout. Running time 99 minutes. One star out of four. ""London Has Fallen"" is Donald Trump in film form. And not even in the funny Funny-or-Die film form which knowingly luxuriates in the ludicrousness of his bombastic persona. ""London Has Fallen"" is a shot of Trumps jingoistic viciousness straight to the veins. In this numbingly violent over-the-top sequel to 2013s ""Olympus Has Fallen"" all Westerners are innocent targets of terrorism. All Muslims are single-minded extremists. And only one man -- Gerard Butler once again swallowing his Scottish accent to play the nations most indestructible Secret Service agent -- can stop them. Its ""America Fuck Yeah"" with zero irony. But lets try to set aside the fear-based philosophical and political underpinnings for a moment and just focus on ""London Has Fallen"" for its entertainment value as an action flick Its actually kind of dull in its monotony. Director Babak Najafi whips up a couple of cool sequences that stand out amid the relentless gunfire and cacophonous destruction. One takes place inside a spinning helicopter as its under attack; the camera spins too from inside the chopper and then outside as it slams into the side of a building before crashing to the ground. In the other he creates the sensation of a lengthy unbroken take as Butlers outnumbered but undaunted Mike Banning tries to hold off a barrage of enemy gunfire down a long narrow street in the black of night. And thatll just about do it for the complimentary portion of this review. Najafi by the way was born in Iran and makes his English-language directing debut with ""London Has Fallen."" Helming a massive action picture with a cast featuring Butler Aaron Eckhart Morgan Freeman Angela Bassett Jackie Earle Haley Melissa Leo and Robert Forster probably sounded like an attractive challenge but I cant help but wonder what he thought of the films ideology. (The screenplay is credited to four people including the husband-and-wife team of Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt who also wrote ""Olympus Has Fallen."") The premise this time is that the British prime minister has died suddenly which means all the worlds leaders must convene in London for his funeral. That includes Eckharts president of the United States Benjamin Asher with the ever-reliable and wisecracking head of his detail Banning as well as Bassetts Lynne Jacobs the Secret Service chief. Also arriving to pay their respects are the leaders of Germany Italy France Japan and Canada. Despite insistence from the local authorities that security is super tight Banning has a bad feeling about this -- and as it turns out hes right. Plus at the films start hes about to quit his job to spend more time with his pregnant wife (Radha Mitchell) whos on the verge of giving birth at any moment. Of course something terrible was going to happen. Middle Eastern Evil Guy Amir Barkawi (Alon Aboutboul) an internationally wanted arms dealer takes the opportunity not only to assassinate all these heads of state but decimate Londons centuries-old landmarks in the process. He does this to avenge the killing of his daughter two years earlier on her wedding day in a drone strike that was meant for him. And he does it by infiltrating the police force and through general high-tech omnipotence. From there Bannings main assignment is to get the president out of London but first he must stop the evildoers whove taken over the city making movement and communication nearly impossible. Back home the vice president (Freeman) and various cabinet members and security chiefs wait and worry as they watch the devastating images from London and receive threats from Barkawi who promises hell kill President Asher at 8 p.m. Gunfire gunfire and more gunfire ensue. But sometimes Banning also gets to stab someone as he protects the president and he literally twists the knife with glee as he does it. Superficially their adrenalized adventures are meant to be thrilling. But fundamental to the duos quest to survive is an us-vs.-them mentality thats offensive in the overly simplistic way it panders to fears of terrorism in general and Muslims in particular. They cant stand us and our way of life the film seems to be saying. These villains dont even get the benefit of characterization beyond hatred and mastery of high-tech weaponry. They will kill as many people as they must to get to the leader of the free world. And when they do get their hands on him they will beat and torture him cruelly. Nearly as obnoxious is the flippant way Banning and Asher share a jovial quip each time they get out of a jam. At one point Banning makes a joke about Asher coming out of the closet after Asher literally has stepped out of a closet. This is the level of repartee you can expect from ""London Has Fallen."" Ostensibly this brand of humor is meant to provide comic relief; instead its cringe-inducing. I hated ""London Has Fallen"" so much that as soon as I got out of the screening I changed the Waze voice on my phone from the smooth comforting tones of Freeman back to Thomas the British guy who mispronounces major Los Angeles streets like La Cienega and Sepulveda. Hopefully no more cities have to fall.

Reply June 24 2016  by  Vegas Gypsy     I immediately knew this ""top reviewer"" was a left-wing liberal who shutters at the thought of Donald Trump becoming the president. She would rather have the queen liar corrupt criminal Hillary Clinton especially because she has the same body parts. Not me...as a woman Im ashamed of those women who are supporting the conniving greedy witch solely because she has a vagina. Shame on all of you. Reply March 20 2016  by  Larry Flennerman     This review just screams ""Im a bleeding heart liberal"". A few middle eastern men are portrayed as villains and that makes the movie jingoistic? Im sure its also by pure happenstance that you forgot to mention that in both this movie and its prequel the ""traitor"" who allowed these attacks to occur because of their own greed and personal grudges turned out to be a white man. And for the record I am absolutely NOT a Trump supporter but this is a violent action movie not a liberal utopian ""safe zone"".

I dont think anyone intelligent liked this film so your review stands as accurate. Truly a horrendous film with fear mongering propaganda. Comments here are suggesting you have a ""biased and liberal"" mentality when its nothing but common sense rather than a political agenda. ""People like you have been trying to destroy us for a hundred years and well be here for another thousand"". That was pretty much the quote in the film. Appeals to racist and xenophobic Americans and thats about it. Saw this with a buddy from France and he couldnt believe what he saw. He actually said ""your country is just as bad as North Korea in terms of propaganda"". Great review Reply March 24 2016  by  Eric Callamezzo     yeah youre right man we should totally not change anything and let muslims come to America with no regulations. Its not like they murder innocent people in terrorists attacks all over the world every day. You are totally right dude. Youre so right man gosh wish i was I was as smart as you SARCASM Reply March 30 2016  by  Skott     You misspelled ""bigotry"" as ""sarcasm"". Reply March 27 2016  by  Ryumoau     Youre pretty stupid arent you? / Reply March 24 2016  by  Eric Callamezzo     yeah this review screams Im so PC i get offended by everything Its an action movie not a political statement. if you watch this without bias its actually entertaining. christy not everything has to not offend everyone. you are a push over in every way. Yeah we get it not every Muslim is a terrorist but some of them are and they continue to murder and slaughter innocent americans. Where does it stop? You cant let this continue theyre trying to wipe America off the earth. We have to destroy ISIS we have to. Reply March 24 2016  by  Person With Common Sense     ""Donald Trump in movie form"" You just said that this movie is actually good and stupid people hate it not because theyve actually seen it but because of what they heard on social media.

LETS GUESS YOUR LIBERAL HILLARY SUPPORTER  Reply March 28 2016  by  Anon     Guys shes just bleeding from her whatever. Reply March 28 2016  by  William Waller     Im not amazed sadly when I read the above review. Ask the people in Brussels or Paris if we should open our doors to Syrian men of military age. The pseudo intellectual reviewer obviously has not read the Quaran or the Hadifs. We as westerners and (God forbid) Christians are AT WAR with radical Islam and although the bleeding heart ""Coexist"" liberals who have never been to a Muslim country may not acknowledge that fact the Jihadists know it and are organizing their efforts accordingly. The movie was a classic shootem up good guys vs bad guys and the good guys win. There is no moral equivalency Only in this movie the bad guys are not red neck fascist like the first movie but radical Muslim fascists. JUST LIKE the creeps that attacked in Belgium Paris Ft Hood etc. The action was nonstop the cinematography and special effects were excellent. The score was moving and exciting. It was a wonderful film with a ""Rocky Balboa"" ending. If Trump represents the US this movie portrays Im gonna vote for him. And I thank God for our constitution that gives us the freedom to say what we think....even the useless drivel this reviewer writes. Go see the film and make up your own mind dont believe Hollywood propaganda Reply June 19 2016  by  Brian     I did see the film. It was awful. Reply April 4 2016  by  Susie Queue     GREAT Review. I too hated this movie and figured it would appeal to Trump voters. It was like watching an extremely long and trite video game Reply June 3 2016  by  Enrico Mezzatesta     Anti trump anti video game... You truly are a boring person Reply April 10 2016  by  Solarized22     Jeez lady. Reply Pingback Londres Bajo Llamas (London has Fallen) - raulachos May 8 2016  by  anon     Saw this movie a while back. I disagree with your review primarily because of the political affiliation coming from an educational element. Wars are waged through all forms of extremism. Trump? Trump has a wide ranged portfolio of facts experience and accomplishments same as Bernie Hillary Carson and Kasich just to name a few candidates. I recommend those reading this to rent first and buy if you like. Reply May 31 2016  by  Kenneth OBrien     Um. Its a movie. An action movie. Its not based on ANY facts and movies are designed to provide escapism. I dont think anyone with any intelligence watched this movie and thought of the Donald. Watch a movie so you can turn off CNN for one and escape your normal boring life. Reply June 17 2016  by  Jimmy Russles     Wahhhhh Donald Trump Maybe you should stick to writing to the garbage heap known as Huffington Post. Reply June 20 2016  by  TeaRunner     Whats worse than injecting politics into a movie? Doing the same in a review. Need to make up your mind are you a reviewer or a political pundit? Reply June 28 2016  by  John J     All hail the GOD EMPEROR TRUMP may be bathe in the blood of all non believers Reply July 3 2016  by  BANE     To be honest the movie didnt specifically state the enemies in this film were Muslim though. I mean they seemed like Muslims. Violent psychopathic stupid unskilled. All inherently Muslim qualities. Either way the film wasnt quite as good as Olympus but it was still awesome to see Gerard Butler kill a ton of Muslim characters(assuming any way). Hopefully more films follow suit. Muslims make for the best bullet sponges. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Photo Gramercy Pictures MOVIE REVIEW London Has Fallen Running time 99 minutes. Rated R (unremitting violence). Racist stupid and boasting cheesy effects that wouldnt pass muster on basic cable the sequel to the surprise hit ""Olympus Has Fallen is a cautionary tale about what could happen if an off-target US drone strike ruins the wedding of a Pakistani arms dealers daughter. Two years later the surviving father and his son have concocted a preposterous revenge plot to kidnap the president of the United States (Aaron Eckhart) so he can be executed on YouTube. As the title hints this involves laying waste to much of the British capital as well as impersonating half the London police force and incidentally killing a number of world leaders assembled for the funeral of the prime minister who died under suspicious circumstances. If you are wondering why the bad guys would fire endless rounds of ammunition at -- as well as downing a helicopter and wrecking two vehicles carrying -- a president they are trying to capture this probably isnt the movie for you. Of course POTUS emerges without a scratch thanks to Secret Service hero Mike (Gerard Butler) who never misses when firing endless rounds at the terrorists even if they are riding on motorcycles. ""Its one thing to plan for this says the head of the Secret Service (Angela Bassett). ""Its another thing to live through it. Not for long though. Iranian-born Swedish director Babak Najafi (who replaces the more accomplished Antoine Fuqua of ""Olympus) gleefully serves up anti-Muslim xenophobia while Butler emits a stream of witless quips (""I was waiting for you to come out of the closet he says when POTUS emerges from a closet to pump some lead into his would-be captors). A mortified Morgan Freeman as the vice president heads an array of character actors (Melissa Leo Robert Forster and Jackie Earle Haley) doing reaction shots while pretending to watch the action unfold on video screens in a situation room built on a soundstage in Bulgaria. Unlike them youd actually have to watch the idiocy of ""London Has Fallen -- and wont get paid for it either.

Whether audiences really need or want or deserve two new Butler offerings in consecutive weeks is a question that must go unanswered until the opening weekend numbers are in. Perhaps there are moviegoers who simply cant get enough of him but for some of us -- by which of course I mean me -- enough is already too much. 2013s ""Olympus Has Fallen"" featured terrorists taking over the White House and destroying much of Washington D.C. with Secret Service agent Mike Banning (Butler) having to rescue President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart) while preventing nuclear catastrophe. Some days are just like that. In the new sequel ""London Has Fallen"" terrorists destroy much of London and Banning has to rescue the Prez while preventing nuclear catastrophe. Hmm. See Video Gerard Butler Aaron Eckhart Run for Their Lives in First London Has Fallen Trailer Yes this is one of those sequels that is essentially a remake with various details changed to give the illusion of freshness. Instead of Korean terrorists we get a family of Pakistani arms dealers who just moonlight as terrorists. Once again events are set up with an opening sequence set a year or two before the rest of the film as a U.S. drone targeting weapons magnate Aamir Barkawi (Alon Aboutboul) manages to miss both him and his sons. Unfortunately the drones human controllers have neglected to ascertain if the target might instead be say Barkawis daughters wedding. Most of the other celebrants are wiped out in a plot development presumably inspired by a 2008 incident in Afghanistan or perhaps a""Homeland"" plot twist from two seasons ago. See Photos Gerard Butler Shows Off His British Pride at London Has Fallen Hollywood Premiere The patriarch has taught his sons that ""vengeance must always be profound and absolute"" and now he can show them how in a real live field operation. This setup suggests a very different political position from ""Olympus"" The Korean terrorists were portrayed as merely mean and crazy but these Pakistanis have an undeniable grievance. Still an argument can be made that they overreact a bit as they cook up a fantastically complicated series of actions that both destroy most of modern civilization and drum up a little business. The plot kicks in when the British Prime Minister dies -- not we later learn a coincidence -- so nearly all world leaders have to show up for the funeral. With such short notice of course their security people cant be as thorough as they would like. Not only do the bad guys attack the funeral; they also destroy most of Londons iconic structures including London Bridge Westminster Abbey the Tower of London and other old favorites. Suddenly chaos looms as nearly all the major nations are suddenly without their leaders. Except for President Asher of course who has Mike Banning looking after him. Much of the film involves Banning and Asher on the run from what appears to be a terrorist force of seemingly thousands; Banning alone appears to dispatch hundreds of them. Agent Banning is the latest in a long line of heroes whose every bullet kills someone -- even as he spins leaps or shoots in two directions at once -- while the bad guys constantly spray him with hundreds of bullets from machine guns none of which seem to hit the target. If you cant suspend that level of disbelief for an hour and a half ""London Has Fallen"" will not be your cup of Earl Grey. Youll also have to suppress any curiosity about how the bad guys have planned and mounted an operation of this size in the middle of London without a single intelligence leak.

And then theres the Gerard Butler problem. Hes in full-on Growl Mode here as he has been in almost everything else hes done even the occasional romantic comedy. The very sight of him triggers memories of ""300"" and expectations that at any minute he may yell ""This is Sparta"" He forever owns the role of Leonidas but not as much as Leonidas owns him.

Its the sequel to 2013s Olympus Has Fallen which was itself a spiritual sequel to Die Hard one building one terrorist group too many hostages and one walkie-talkie-taunting badass who can save the day. As the queasily exhilarating propaganda piece retraced Bruce Williss bare footsteps it was so bloodthirsty that it couldnt resist extra neck stabs (and gut stabs and head stabs and that dude who got his skull bashed in with a bust of Abraham Lincoln). Like most sequel cash grabs London Has Fallen is even bigger and dumber. Our battleground has expanded to Englands capital city recently destroyed in Thor The Dark World Star Trek Into Darkness and G.I. Joe Retaliation. (Sorry guys Were just sick of blowing up New York) Our enemies have also expanded from the hermit army of North Korea to a network of terrorists who hop from Pakistan to Yemen enlisting others in a sneak attack to assassinate every Western head of state. As a British MI-6 agent (Elsa Mollien) attests this new enemy is ""the United Nations of every-fucking-body who hates us."" Lets be real. The original film directed by Antoine Fuqua was pretty racist against North Koreans. Like a Trump speech that was part of its uncomfortable thrall -- how crude would it get? New director Babak Najafi who was born in Iran and fled to Sweden is more cautious. He doesnt want to slander all Middle Easterners even though every bad guy who gets a close-up is brown. His villains he insists can blend in with good old British bobbies even those guys in the fur beehives. Londons racial profiling is coy. When a group of terrorists disguise themselves as American soldiers Gerard Butlers superhero bodyguard Banning figures out their identities with a glance -- but not because of their skin color (olive) or beard (bushy). No no the script swears -- its because if these ""soldiers"" had run from the U.S. drop spot they should be sweatier. Yeah yeah. London Has Fallen is still obsessed with stereotypes. Even Americas allies are punch lines. Early on Banning and his charge President Asher (Aaron Eckhart thankfully a POTUS in good enough shape to run) roll up to the prime ministers funeral -- the bait that lures 40 leaders into a death trap. Najafi cuts to the other countries rulers and each is as predictable as an old stand-up routine -- Germany is early France is snottily late and the Italian is on the rooftop of Westminster Abbey romancing a much-younger mistress -- and right away the terrorists find and kill them. While people will no doubt attack London for its Arab villains spare a thought for their victims. Caricatures not characters murdered just to make the Americans look comparatively professional. I wouldnt blame Italians for throwing popcorn at the screen. Focus FeaturesHead villain and arms dealer Aamir Barkawi (Alon Aboutboul) has a special plan for President Asher execute him live on YouTube. Barkawi also has a motive. Two years before American forces tried to kill him in a drone strike in Pakistan but the U.S. missiles wiped out his daughters wedding. Najafi is willing to humanize Barkawi -- a little. In an opening flashback we see him as dignified and proud as Marlon Brandos Vito Corleone surrounded by the lovely bride and a dance floor of grinning aunts. The womens doomed faces haunt us through the carnage to come. And President Ashers excuse that he didnt know about the bash sounds weak -- especially when the U.S. drones prove to be so sensitive that they can spot Banning sending a silent message by holding his rifle in a different hand. But Najafi doesnt want us to think too hard about the complexities of modern war. He wants to dwell on the last thing Barkawi said before his family was destroyed ""Vengeance must be profound and absolute."" Which means Look out Gerard Butler. Shits about to go down. If only that shit were more fun. Najafi can shoot a car chase -- a great one in fact -- but the second half of the film is all murky gunfights that make you squint to see who was shot and where. Instead of cutting to just one nervous Washington war room of advisers he adds a second English headquarters which gives us only half as much time with good actors like Morgan Freeman and Melissa Leo. (Leo who had such powerful scenes in Olympus is now treated like an extra.) Worse Najafi cant give London a personality. He tries limply. Banning is a father-to-be for no other reason than the contrast of seeing Butler a stone slab who smiles fret over how many security cameras to install in the nursery. Butler has stopped channeling Bruce Willis but hes still not his own man. He doesnt even have his own catchphrase. He just poaches two of Schwarzeneggers bellowing both ""Get to the chopper"" and ""Ill be back"" Butler seems like hed be great to pound beers with offscreen. I bet he comes to life in a bar. Here however hes a steel exoskeleton made of ego and expletives. When President Asher mid-shootout asks Banning what to do if his personal T-800 doesnt return Butler grins and says ""Youre fucked."" Like a kid smoking cigarettes behind the gym the movie is delighted to swear. And like that twerpy kid the behavior can make the film seem silly like when a sweet deathbed speech suddenly ends with ""Make those fuckers pay"" Butler cant even drink a glass of water without blustering ""Im thirsty as fuck"" That line made my theater snort. Najafi would be relieved. Like its predecessor London Has Fallen doesnt want to be taken totally seriously -- if audiences did that theyd find it repugnant. (And the audiences who will treat it seriously are people Id rather not meet.) As an action flick its mediocre. As War on Terror agitprop it hurts us as much as it hurts our enemies. The movie is so thrilled to prove our might -- even at the cost of innocent lives - that America looks like a meathead aching for an excuse to brawl. When Banning twists a knife in a killers spine just so his friends can hear him scream the president gasps ""Was that really necessary?"" ""No"" shrugs Banning. And the fight rages on.

Look how many times Liam Neeson profited by misplacing his daughter in the Taken franchise. But really all other paycheck sellouts should bow to the crass exploitation at work in London Has Fallen. Iranian-born director  Babak Najafi who not surprisingly staged something called Easy Money II botches the action sequences so crudely consistently and cynically that he makes Michael Bay look like Kurosawa. As White House muscle Banning Butler squints and flexes to ab-shame his enemies from a country this USA jingoist calls ""Fuckheadistan."" Who can resist this stuff? Sadly not Morgan Freeman who signed on to play the American Veep. Freeman basically stands around in D.C. staring blankly at a video screen along with staffers played by Melissa Leo Robert Forster and Jackie Earle Haley -- good actors who should know better. And oh the Islamaphobic dialogue from ugly Americans. ""You have to take out their families when you get these terrorists you have to take out their families. When they say they dont care about their lives you have to take out their families."" Oh wait apologies to screenwriters Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt Donald Trump said that. Theyd never have the nerve. But you get my point.

Its more than the one-man-army absurdity of aging security chief Gerard Butler as he winningly fights the war on terrorists. Its more than the starry-eyed devotion of his pregnant wife as she tells him ""You go and do what you have to do and we will be right here when you get back."" All that might be satire by exaggeration or it might just be thuddingly sincere. But there are little things like a man explaining his superhuman stamina by saying hes made of ""bourbon and bad choices."" Or lecturing a bad guy on how America is an idea and not a man even as hes trying to rescue the president. And there are bigger things like a bad guy who is basically a good American capitalist (except hes from somewhere else) agitating the market in order to create demand for his product. Granted his product is arms and agitating the market means fostering political instability. But hey business is business. And as he notes hes never come after America -- at least not until America killed his daughter on her wedding day via drone strike. He may plan to chop off the presidents head with a sword but hes no religious extremist. Hes a grieving father. In any other story hed be the hero possibly played by Liam Neeson. But since hes coming after us well...America heck yeah.

And Banning is there to protect him as seemingly all of London is in on the plot to kidnap Asher and stream his execution on the Internet.In service to his boss Banning kills with impunity stabbing and shooting his way through Londons streets and alleyways while the body count rises to that of a 1980s action movie.But its rarely exciting or suspenseful and some of the digital effects are also reminiscent of a 1980s action movie level. A too-good-for-this-movie supporting cast including Morgan Freeman Angela Bassett Melissa Leo and Jackie Earle Haley is mostly stuck sitting around a large conference room table reacting to images on a video screen.Director Antoine Fuqua at least gave ""Olympus Has Fallen"" a disquieting feel like it was something that could really happen.

"Review London Has Fallen is for angry conspiracy theorists not so much for others - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review London Has Fallen is for angry conspiracy theorists not so much for others London Has Fallen Review David Appleby / Gramercy Pictures Gerard Butler in ""London Has Fallen. Gerard Butler in ""London Has Fallen. (David Appleby / Gramercy Pictures) Robert Abele For those who like their terrorism-fighting extra Trump-y the extended macho grunt called ""London Has Fallen"" might be required viewing for a portion of the blustery candidates followers. Ostensibly a sequel to ""Olympus Has Fallen"" the White House siege movie of three years ago this by-the-numbers slog which returns stars Gerard Butler as Secret Service bad-ass Mike Banning and Aaron Eckhart as kidnap-prone U.S. President Asher more accurately represents a geopolitical obliteration fantasy flushed from the mind of the angriest and dumbest and most conspiracy-minded among us.When a drone strike wipes out an entire wedding party outside of Lahore Pakistan the world mourns. Just kidding The idea was to take out notorious arms dealer Aamir Barkawi (Alon Moni Aboutboul) a gray-suited villain who says lines like ""Vengeance must always be profound and absolute"" as if he were selling imported vodka. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story Barkawi survived though and two years later the payback is well elaborate. When the British prime minister croaks dozens of world honchos descend on Englands capital for the funeral leading to a montage roll call of visiting dignitaries and British and American characters so chunky you want to issue a congestion charge.Bannings shrewd decision to show up early though saves President Asher when coordinated bombs and guns go off across London killing a handful of leaders -- sorry Japan Canada Germany and France -- and turning the city into a terrorist stronghold with their sights on the U.S. leader. After a car chase and a copter crash Banning and the president are on their own while the war room gang back home -- including the vice president (Morgan Freeman) and Defense secretary (Melissa Leo) -- watch monitors in terror as they realize Barkawi is still alive. ""London Has Fallen"" credited to four screenwriters hews to a reactionary playbook in which warriors with weapons win while those in power are stupid. Freemans veep ""Hes probably been planning this for years"" (Duh Do you not follow up on the ramifications of killing bad guys families?) President Asher stating the obvious about the massive breach in U.K. security ""Theres got to be somebody on the inside"" Read more movie reviews gt;gt;Open link As for the action director Babak Najafi shows voguish impatience with such details as shootout coherence and clean-looking CGI explosions but loves some close-up stabbing. (The killings sound like a game of Clue ""Butler with the knife in [any room]."") The star meanwhile relishes his protect-and-shiv duties playing Banning like a foul-mouthed trainer on a roid bender.Its not unamusing but the emotional padding -- the pregnant worried wife (Radha Mitchell) back home wondering if he should retire -- is patently superfluous. So too sadly is Angela Bassett as Butlers boss as underused as an Academy Award-nominated actor has ever been. (Never mind the Oscar-winning window dressing of Freeman and Leo.) Even Eckharts granite jaw is better served in this movie than Bassett.As long as there are enemies in Islamic lands well probably have to endure risible time-wasters like ""London Has Fallen"" designed to justify blinkered foreign policy attitudes and stoke jokey hatred. Its notable that the montage of visiting leaders doesnt include one from a Middle Eastern country.

Credit Focus Features President Benjamin Asher needs two things better security personnel and better scriptwriters.The first time the president (Aaron Eckhart) was snatched by terrorists in the 2013 thriller ""Olympus Has Fallen"" watching his favorite Secret Service agent Mike Banning rescue him was at least somewhat fun in a mindless sort of way. Now incredibly the same president has been snatched by terrorists again in the new ""London Has Fallen"" and this time the rescue is an unimaginative repetitive slog.The president along with practically every other significant world leader travels to London for a state funeral and a preposterous number of terrorists with an equally preposterous supply of guns and explosives are waiting for him. They blow up a good portion of the city in the process of taking him captive planning to execute him live on the Internet. Only one man can save him.In the first movie Gerard Butler who plays Banning came close to the likably taciturn effect he was going for but here hes just boring and annoying. Over and over this written-by-committee movie (Babak Najafi directed) tries to give him and Mr. Eckhart the kind of clipped one- and two-liners that aspire to be the next ""Ill be back"" but all of them fall flat. The gun battles are incoherently filmed and the flag-waving is embarrassing. Will this hard-luck president again defy death while his stoic sidekick vanquishes the nasty uncivilized terrorists? Its hard to care when a movie is this formulaic and moronic.""London Has Fallen"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) because blood is shed and unprintable words are uttered.

Well maybe not YOU specifically -- but because moviegoers around the world contributed to the 2013 ""Die Hard"" ripoff ""Olympus Has Fallen"" earning more than 160 million at the box office we now get a sequel which as you might have surmised from the title is set mostly in London. Like the original ""London Has Fallen"" features a top-notch cast and some crackling good action sequences. And alas like the original this is a cliche-riddled aggressively violent laughably plotted exploitation flick that leaves few stereotypes unturned. Its slick trash. You wonder how the likes of Academy Award winners Morgan Freeman and Melissa Leo as well as reliable veterans Gerard Butler Aaron Eckhart Angela Bassett Robert Forster and Radha Mitchell were able to maintain straight faces while reciting some of their lines. As you might recall if youve seen the original Butler plays Mike Banning the Secret Service agent who came to the aid of President Benjamin Asher (Eckhart) after North Korean terrorists mounted a full assault on the White House. Cut to present day. President Asher is still in office with Mike leading his Secret Service detail. Mikes wife Leah is pregnant and worried sick about Mike. Thats the entirety of the role Shes pregnant and worried sick about Mike. When the British prime minister dies unexpectedly leaders from around the world travel to London for the funeral with security at peak levels. Mike accompanies the president to the service and lets just say it doesnt go off without a hitch. Cue the painfully realistic CGI shots of famous London landmarks exploding and burning to the ground British citizens running for their lives bodies flying through the air in slow motion soldiers and security details exchanging gunfire with terrorists -- and Mike outwitting and outshooting everyone as he narrowly escapes with the president. Cut to the obligatory war room scene in Washington where Vice President Allan Trumbull (Morgan Freeman) Secretary of Defense Ruth McMillan (Melissa Leo) Gen. Edward Clegg (Robert Forster) and Chief of Staff DC Mason (Jackie Earle Haley) among others have gathered to say things like ""Oh my God"" as they watch events unfurl. When the terrorist Aamir Barkawi (Alon Moni Aboutboul) appears on the monitor in the war room and starts talking trash Defense Secretary McMillan helpfully informs the room Barkawi is ""No. 6 on the list"" of the FBIs 10 Most Wanted. (Wonder how they came up with that number. Did No. 1 seem too cliched while No. 9 didnt seem evil enough?) Barkawi tells the Americans his group is going to strike cities around the nation -- and torture and execute the president live on the Internet. ""Just imagine every major city descending into chaos"" he snarls. ""Your president dies tonight."" Meanwhile Mike and President Asher are isolated and on the run unable to communicate with allies and barely a step ahead of the swarms of terrorists closing in on them. It seems only a matter of time before theyre captured. ""I will not be executed as propaganda"" Asher tells Mike. ""You dont let that happen If it comes to it I want you to kill me. Thats an order."" Eckhart delivers a one-note performance as the noble but soft President Asher who once again has to put his life in the hands of the grizzled world-weary but resourceful Mike a one-man wrecking machine who continues along the ""Die Hard"" John McClain path. In a telephone exchange with Barkawi in which Barkawi announces his intentions to capture and execute the president Mike growls ""Yeah? You shoulda brought more men"" Gerard Butler can do this kind of role in his sleep and at times he seems to be going through the motions even during the action sequences. Its difficult to imagine anyone appearing in this film thought of it as more than a payday. 1/2 Gramercy Pictures presents a film directed by Babak Najafi and written by Creighton Rothenberger Katrin Benedikt Christian Gudegast and Chad St. John. Running time 99 minutes. Rated R (for strong violence and language throughout). Opens Friday at local theaters.

"London Has Fallen | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; london-has-fallen ) London Has Fallen (United States 2016) March 03 2016 A movie review by James Berardinelli 2013s Olympus Has Fallen was a surprisingly entertaining Die Hard knock-off set in Washington D.C. with intrepid Secret Service Agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) out to rescue President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart) from the hands of terrorists. The films successful box office run resulted in Butler and many of his co-stars being brought back three years later for a return engagement. And Banning like Bruce Willis John McClane might easily wonder how the ""same [stuff] could happen to the same guy twice."" This time the stakes are higher but the terrain is different. One wonders whether the producers of London Has Fallen had any qualms about releasing the film so soon after the terrorist attacks in Paris. Admittedly similarities are superficial (a coordinated attack on a major European city) but its becoming increasingly more difficult to equate this sort of story with ""entertainment"" as the grim reality of mass murder converges with Hollywoods action-thriller variety. At what point does a movie like London Has Fallen cross the line between escapism and exploitation? After opening with a few scenes of setup detailing how the characters have evolved since Olympus Has Fallen London Has Fallen sends President Asher and Banning off to London to attend the funeral of a recently departed Prime Minister. Vice President Trumbull (Morgan Freeman) remains behind to run the country. The funeral is actually an elaborate trap orchestrated by arms dealer/terrorist Barkawi (Alon Aboutboul) and his sadistic son Kamran (Waleed Zuaiter). One-by-one world leaders are gunned down blown up or crushed by debris until the Last Man Standing is Asher. He and Banning go on the run and with the help of a British agent (Charlotte Riley a.k.a. Mrs. Tom Hardy) seek safety while awaiting the cavalry which is disappointingly tardy. London Has Fallen is competently made and offers what any viewer would reasonably expect. Theres plenty of action a fair amount of wide-scale destruction and a rousing climax. The denouement is disappointing but I suppose thats to be expected considering how many diverse threads have to be tied off in a short time. Still the scene in the parking garage feels awkward and extraneous - something shoehorned in to plug a plot hole. Overall London Has Fallen is neither as effective nor as rousing as Olympus Has Fallen mainly because of the ""been there done that"" factor. Action sequels often suffer from this problem and neither director Babak Najafi nor his small army of screenwriters find a way to make installment 2 sufficiently different from installment 1 to merit the same degree of interest. Gerard Butler probably needs to play Banning again more than audiences need to see the performance. Butlers once-promising career has foundered and hes in need of a hit to re-establish himself (Gods of Egypt wont be it). With more of Jack Bauers intensity and less of John McClanes wisecracking Banning is almost too serious for a would-be popcorn film. Aaron Eckhart gets to be more of an active participant than a male ""damsel in distress."" Pretty much everyone else returning from the first film - Morgan Freeman Angela Bassett Radha Mitchell - is given little or nothing to do. (Then again one could argue that Mitchell didnt have anything in the first film either.) The new bad guys are cookie-cutter terrorists although its interesting to note that they are represented as illegal arms dealers and no mention is made of an extremist religious ideology. The attack in London Has Fallen is ludicrous in its complexity and scope but action films arent meant to be representations of reality. To the extent that the movies primary purpose is to elevate the pulse and provide 90 minutes of ""sound and fury signifying nothing"" London Has Fallen accomplishes its goal. As action-thrillers go this one provides what the previews tease. Maybe thats enough for an evenings mindless throw-away entertainment but I cant help but be disappointed that the filmmakers couldnt have brought something more inventive to a genre that too often relies on worn-out tropes.

"London Has Fallen and so will your brain cells review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesLondon Has Fallen and so will your brain cells reviewSequel is a sick macho fantasy for Donald Trump times. Gerard Butler and Aaron Eckhart race through London in London Has Fallen. (David Appleby / TNS)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. March 3 2016London Has FallenStarring Gerard Butler Aaron Eckhart Angela Bassett Morgan Freeman and Radha Mitchell. Diirected by Babak Najafi. At GTA theatres. 99 minutes. 14AA sick macho fantasy for Donald Trump times London Has Fallen has just one unique feature about it.It makes the 2013 original Olympus Has Fallen -- loglined as ""Die Hard in the White House"" - seem in nostalgic comparison like quality entertainment and a model of logic and good taste. No small feat for a blood-soaked Antoine Fuqua actioner where the vile foreign invaders did everything short of drop-kicking the presidential puppy off the West Wing balcony.Article Continued BelowBrainless sequel London Has Fallen a real No. 2 returns flailing Scotsman Gerard Butler as Secret Service killing machine Mike Banning whos fuelled by ""bourbon and bad choices."" Hes soon to be a daddy with his reconciled wife (Radha Mitchell). Retirement from White House stress beckons.But duty calls again as the other principal stereotypes resume their positions Aaron Eckhart as endangered U.S. President Benjamin Asher Angela Bassett as Bannings beleaguered boss and Morgan Freeman as the House Speaker who talks and acts like a real Commander in Chief. The action moves to Blighty where London and multiple world leaders are threatened and the exotic peril is Pakistani rather than North Korean but no less barbaric. Terrorist leader Aamir Barkawi (Alon Aboutboul) is out for both vengeance and mass destruction for the hell of it as he targets foreign dignitaries attending the funeral of the British Prime Minister among them Canadas mild-mannered PM (no relation to Justin Trudeau).So far so predictable but franchise newcomer Babak Najafi (Easy Money II Hard to Kill) falls prey to the scariest threat of all sequel bloat. He and his screenwriters up the ante so much the movie turns into a giant video game where bullets and offensive ethnic cliches abound.Any semblance to reality is accidental. The absurd number of murderous turncoat cops approaches the zombie horde levels of World War Z. This gives free reign to Banning to shoot stab and/or maim anyone in his path as he and President Asher tear through the streets of a bombed-out London looking for safe haven ""Every single one of these guys is a terrorist a--hole until proven otherwise"" Banning barks.He actually seems to enjoy killing. So much so that after one particularly brutal slaying Asher asks him ""Was that really necessary?""Its a rare moment of reflection in a movie that otherwise hammers home the jingoistic message that no world problem is too big for Uncle Sam if you give him enough muscle guns and ammo.

Comments (2) click to enlarge London Has Fallen Video Rated R  100 minutes  2016 This sequel to the action blockbuster Olympus Has Fallen (2013) is even more brutally violent and jingoistic than its predecessor. Most of the principal cast are back including Aaron Eckhart as the U.S. president and Gerard Butler as a terrorist-leveling secret service agent yet the earlier movies premise of a North Korean-led attack on the White House has been topped with an even more crass paranoia-feeding scenario an ISIS-like group targets world leaders gathered to attend a funeral in downtown London. This deserves some credit for making the terrorists motive clear--""You murder our families from the sky"" says one in reference to U.S. drone strikes--but the American characters are quick to excuse the killing of innocent civilians as ""unintentional"" (before hitting them again). Butler is in his action-hero element and Eckhart nails his comic-relief moments (""I havent driven a car in six years"") but their mildly diverting performances arent enough to dislodge the films troubling pro-engagement message.

In the dark of night theres nothing left for Mike to do but kill everyone they come across at which point watching London Has Fallen is like watching someone else play Call of Duty. The enemy in all this is a Pakistani arms dealer named Aamir Barkawi (Alon Aboutboul) whose family has been decimated by the Americans. He plans the attacks on London in revenge but is especially keen on killing the U.S. president filming that killing and posting it online for all the world to see. The story plays on a current and deeply unpleasant Us vs. Them paranoia rampant in America making London Has Fallen a must-see for Donald Trump and his ilk. Anyway poor old Banning really has his work cut out for him. Besides protecting the president he also has to get safely back to America himself because his wife is having their first baby. Because who wouldnt want to live happily ever after with a jingoistic stone cold racist killer with anger issues. So this is a touching emotional element. Meanwhile theres lots more going on in the way of killing and subterfuge but youll just have to go and see it for yourself. Against all odds the movie has a great cast that includes among others Morgan Freeman Angela Bassett Melissa Leo and Radha Mitchell. Go figure.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint London Has Fallen 1/2 out of four stars Rated R for strong violence and language throughout. Pursuing next years Razzies worst film award at a mad gallop Gerard Butler gives us his second torturously bad film in a week. Popular opinion has declared the intolerable ""Gods of Egypt"" DOA. ""London Has Fallen"" will trigger a dissenting opinion. It is far worse. Butler plays a Secret Service bodyguard a tough-as-testosterone he-man whom President Aaron Eckhart can barely resist clasping in a long bro hug. When the death of Britains prime minister draws Air Force One to the state funeral Middle Eastern assassination squads rapidly take out a vast list of world leaders. Earlier in the film a drone strike in Pakistan blew up the marriage of an arms dealers daughter. Because ""vengeance must always be profound and absolute"" he has filled the English capital with an army of terrorists to get revenge on the worlds leaders. Cue a long montage of cars falling from exploded bridges killers in impossibly effective disguises and exploding landmarks. Butler strikes back with the kind of two-fisted ferocity that a chest-pounding mountain gorilla would envy. Eckharts president is identical to most adventure films damsel in distress; theres even a gag about him coming out of the closet when he hides in there from the big bad villains. Aiming to trigger a spontaneous chant of ""USA USA"" after every bloodbath this is a xenophobic pile of dead body parts in search of a movie. I dont know the best way to deal with Americas enemies but I suspect a jingoistic macho-porn slaughterfest is not likely to win hearts and minds. Morgan Freeman makes an appearance as the vice president looking extremely troubled. I think he was realizing what sort of a movie he had signed on to. COLIN COVERT The Wave [?][?] out of four stars Rated R for some language and disaster elements. Theater Uptown. Nestled in western Norways Sunnmore region the Geirangerfjord is so scenically spectacular its a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Its a magnetic tourist draw with towering waterfalls and sky-high mountains where shifting tectonic plates continually threaten to crumble into the water throwing a Godzilla-sized tsunami over residents and visitors alike. The great vistas get wasted in this underwhelming Nordic disaster movie which I would give 1.5 on the Richter scale. Kristian is a geologist finishing up his last day at the local warning center. You know what happens next As fast as you can say unstable substrata a collapsing mountain sends a giant wall of water toward town and his family with just 10 minutes to escape. Borrowing heavily from ""Titanic"" and lesser catastrophe films character development plummets and dialogue is reduced to the usual run of ""Save my babies"" and ""No save me first"" debates. His wife swims like a Navy SEAL and plays a part in the movies biggest conflict as she deals with a quarrelsome cowardly Danish tourist. What becomes of him will surely move Norwegians and Swedes to applause cheers and whistles. COLIN COVERT Rabin the Last Day [?][?]1/2 out of four stars Unrated In Hebrew with English subtitles. Theater St. Anthony Main. On Nov. 4 1995 after addressing a peace rally in a Tel Aviv Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel was assassinated. The following year a commission of inquiry documented lapses in security on that night. Amos Gitais film attempts to measure the lingering effects of Rabins death. It is a somewhat ungainly blend of documentary and historical re-enactments. Apart from archival news clips and retrospective interviews with Shimon Peres the former Israeli prime minister and Rabins wife Leah the film often feels more like theater than cinema. It is a series of speeches and depositions a whirlwind of discourse surrounding a terrible and confounding act of violence. A.O. SCOTT New York Times The Boy and the Beast [?][?]1/2 out of four stars Rating PG-13 for some violence and language. Theater Lagoon. In this new Japanese animated feature a street urchin is taken in and raised by anthropomorphic animals. But it is the world of man not beast that makes this coming-of-age movie most touching. The son of divorced parents 9-year-old Ren takes to the streets after his mother dies in an accident. He stumbles onto a parallel world where hes taught discipline by Kumatetsu a volatile bearlike creature who wears clothing and speaks. Think ""The Karate Kid."" Unfortunately the character design of the animals is underdeveloped. As Ren grows he must ultimately choose between living in the world of beasts or humans while learning to navigate rivalries between and within those worlds. Despite the films fantastical elements his choice is easy The human conflicts are more resonant. PAT PADUA Washington Post Rams [?][?][?]1/2 out of four stars Rating R for language and brief graphic nudity. Theater Edina. ""Rams"" is named not only in honor of the sheep that are central to its story but also because of two hardheaded men who are devoted to the sheep but cant stand each other. It is the latest in a series of excellent films to come out of Iceland. Serious and moving but also with a bleaker than bleak Scandinavian sense of humor ""Rams"" is so much its own film that figuring out where its unusual unpredictable plot will end up is difficult if not impossible. The two men in question are bearded bachelor brothers who havent spoken to each other in 40 years even though theyve spent all that time living on adjoining sheep farms. It is a severe shock to the entire area when an affliction known as scrapie is discovered in the herds. Scrapie is an incurable infectious disease that attacks an animals brain and spinal cord and the only way it can be controlled is to kill every sheep in the vicinity. The story of rivalry and hostility in ""Rams"" is not without its moments of bizarre humor such as the way the brothers communicate by using a message-carrying dog named Sami. Its a cold world up there and the absurd is never very far away.

More about London Has Fallen >> You dont say. In London Has Fallen the rip-roaring sequel to 2013s White House-under-siege hit Olympus Has Fallen Secret Service agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) looks around at the terrorists disguised as police the terrorists disguised as Buckingham Palace guards the terrorists aiming shoulder-launched rockets at the president of the United States and decides there has been a security lapse. No kidding. Five world leaders have just been assassinated. Bridges buildings and monuments have been blown to smithereens. And President Benjamin Asher (a somewhat Bush-ian Aaron Eckhart) is on the run chased by squads of armed extremists. Written by husband-and-wife team (and former Philadelphians) Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt (with some added screenplay assists) and directed by Babak Najafi London Has Fallen is an impossibly enjoyable live-action cartoon that plays on our real-life anxieties about vengeful cadres of foreign radicals blowing up people - and places. The British prime minister has died of an apparent heart attack so a memorial service has been arranged with dignitaries from around the world descending on London for the event. ""Its a logistical nightmare"" worries Lynn Jacobs (Angela Bassett) the director of the Secret Service. Shes Mikes boss and she has also just agreed to be godmother to Mike and his wifes (Radha Mitchell) baby expected to pop in a matter of weeks. With dadhood looming Mike has been busy composing his resignation letter but before he can hit ""send"" on his laptop a call comes in from the White House. The prime minister is dead and Mike is needed to head the team to protect the prez. The duo are jogging partners. They bonded after the bloody showdown with the North Koreans who stormed 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in Olympus Has Fallen. In the wake of the elaborately planned attacks - the years-in-the-making orchestrations of an arms dealer by the name of Aamir Barkawi (Alon Aboutboul) - Mike and Mr. President are gunning an armor-plated Range Rover up and down London side streets. Its not long before Eckharts commander in chief is firing back at the waves of pursuing bad guys too. Its like Harrison Ford in Air Force One the president as action hero. If theres a third Fallen movie they can stop with the protector/protectee stuff and just show Mike and the president patrolling the District of Columbia in a limo looking out for trouble. And if theres a sequel to this sequel they should also do something about the comically stymied supporting cast watching the horrific events unfold from the Situation Room. Vice President Trumbull (Morgan Freeman) is in command as cool and calm as someone who keeps exclaiming ""Oh my God"" can be. But Melissa Leo (the secretary of Defense) Jackie Earle Haley (the chief of staff) and Robert Forster (the top military man at the table) bring new meaning to the word ineffectual. Sure theyre sitting there watching live drone shots of the London conflagration and theres not much they really can do - but theyre behaving more like sedated patients in a psych ward than presidential advisers. As soon as he dusts himself off and returns to the Oval Office President Asher needs to shuffle his Cabinet. New secretary of Defense? Mike Banning who else? He knows how to bring it on.

Caption A sampling of recent movies that received one star or less from Washington Post film critics. One star Sid (John Leguizamo) meets a female sloth (Jessie J) in ""Ice Age Collision Course."" Stephanie Merry writes ""Ice Age Collision Course"" the fifth installment in the 14-year-long saga of animated prehistoric animals will with any luck also be the last. Lazy scattershot and excruciatingly unfunny the movie is a hazard to the very young who might come away with the erroneous impression that movies dont get any better than this."" Read the full review. Blue Sky Studios/Twentieth Century Fox Film Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. So far 2016 hasnt been the best year for Gerard Butler. Just a week after the outrageously awful ""Gods of Egypt"" tanked at the box office the Scottish actor is in yet another clunky superfluous action movie. ""London Has Fallen"" is remarkable only because of how much worse it is than its inane predecessor 2013s ""Olympus Has Fallen."" Once again Butler plays Secret Service agent Mike Banning whos all brawn when hes protecting President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart) but gets all googly-eyed when hes with his pregnant wife Leah (Radha Mitchell). Shes two weeks away from giving birth to their first child and Mikes pained expression shows how badly he wants to stay home. But he has a job to do by god so off he goes to London with the president for the funeral of the British prime minister who has died unexpectedly. You can see where this is going A head of state suddenly expires but before anyone finds out whether the death is you know part of a terrorist plot every leader imaginable from around the globe flocks to Britain. They end up as sitting ducks in a painstakingly orchestrated attack. We meet them all -- the Canadian prime minister the French president Italys head of state (whos with a much younger woman naturally) -- just in time to see them all get blown to smithereens in various fiery blasts. Just about every London landmark also falls victim to the attacks except for the London Eye so tourists can still spend way too much to see the skyline. When the British prime minister dies under mysterious circumstances world leaders flock to London for the funeral. But a deadly plot ultimately takes hold to kill the powerful leaders including the U.S. president. (  / Gramercy Pictures) Of course because of Mikes clever last-minute schedule switch one man will not fall prey to these radicals the president of the United States. The terrorist behind the massacre is Barkawi (Alon Aboutboul) No. 6 on the FBIs most wanted list. We know this because the secretary of defense (Melissa Leo) informs the Situation Room of his identity right before the vice president (Morgan Freeman) launches into an awkward summary of Barkawis misdeeds. Lets all hope that the officials in the real Situation Room are more tuned in. Here we get a bunch of clowns who do little beyond gasp and cover their mouths every time some new horror pops up on the television screens. Back in London Mike and the president are on the run trying to evade teams of terrorists on motorcycles. The terrorists want to capture the president in order to decapitate him on live television streamed around the globe. You wont have to contemplate this grisly scenario too deeply because the assault on your senses never stops bad guys getting stabbed in the eye the stomach the neck; good guys getting peppered with machine-gun spray. And all the while its impossible to comprehend whats happening because of the ham-fisted editing. Maybe director Babak Najafi realized a movie needs more than nonstop havoc. So he inserted a bizarre quiet interlude in the middle of the action so that Mike and the president can bond over fatherhood. Its an artless grab for our heartstrings. At least unlike the rest of this loud dumb bloodbath its good for a laugh. R. At area theaters.

""London Has Fallen"" is dumb as a rock. I was thinking about ""Die Hard"" which I watched the other day in tribute to the late Alan Rickman.This thing is a mess.

Thats not a spoiler really because ... well the title for one thing. For another these types of movies depend on blowing things up early often and loudly. Its a convenient substitute for plausible stories.It has been three years since the events of ""Olympus Has Fallen."" Secret Service agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) is still protecting President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart) with whom he is close. (At times the film is practically a bromance). Banning and his wife Leah (Radha Mitchell) are expecting a child any day now which is movie code for imminent danger.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Gerard Butler and Morgan Freeman try to stop a plot to assassinate several world leaders in this action-packed sequel. VPCIt arrives quickly. The movie starts with international bad-guy arms dealer Aamir Barkawi (Alon Aboutboul) hosting his daughters wedding. A drone strike doesnt kill him but does kill his daughter. Revenge is afoot.A couple of years later Great Britains prime minister dies and the mourning country arranges a state funeral that will include all of the worlds leaders. Lynne Jacobs (Angela Bassett) the Secret Service director warns the president she hates things like this which allow for little planning. (This is as much movie code for imminent danger as a pregnant wife.)Sure enough despite the obvious security concerns the worlds leaders arrive in London in as implausibly complicated ways as possible by land air and water. Italys prime minister and his just-turned-30 wife sneak off for a private tour of Westminster Abbey and hugs on the roof evidently without security because of course thats what one does in a high-terror-threat situation.Secret Service agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler left) protects the president (Aaron Eckhart) in ""London Has Fallen."" (Photo Millennium Films)Japans prime minister gets stuck in traffic on a bridge. And so forth and so on. President Asher arrives early because Banning likes to keep everyone guessing. Najafi does not. Its all predictable action fare.Despite the funeral being what a news report calls the most secure spot in the world everything goes south in a hurry. Apparently every cop and soldier in England is on the plot to kill as many leaders as possible and to kidnap one in particular.Guess who.After a series of spectacular chases and crashes Banning and Asher wind up on the run together a kind of buddy team. Never mind that one of them is the president.Back on the home front Vice President Trumbull (Morgan Freeman) back from a fishing trip holds down the fort in the Situation Room a task that consists mostly of looking really concerned and occasionally saying things that sound more meaningful than they are because theyre said in Morgan Freemans voice.Gerard Butler (left) and Aaron Eckhart try to survive in ""London Has Fallen."" (Photo Gramercy Pictures)The ultimate plan of Kamran Barkawi (Waleed Zuaiter) who is Aamirs son is to abduct Asher and execute him on YouTube. Banning of course has other plans. Its all silly and meant to be fun except when Najafi tries to throw in some serious bits which wind up being sillier still. (Asher apparently inherited his administrations foreign policy from a Trump-Cruz administration.)But if youre a fan who knows? Maybe there will be a third installment.

Its happening all over again in ""London Has Fallen"" the ridiculously improbable and breathtakingly shameless sequel to the 2013 action hit ""Olympus Has Fallen."" Shameless because -- come on -- if ever there was a picture that did not lend itself to sequelization it was ""Olympus."" It was barely possible to buy the feverish Hollywood fantasy about a terrorist smackdown of the super-duper highest-tech protective cocoon surrounding the leader of the free world. When its near-clone came out mere months later in the form of ""White House Down"" the bloom was already well off that particular rose of a plot. However ""Olympus"" was a big fat hit so a sequel was ordered up. Improbability be damned. How to top ""Olympus""? Well director Babak Najafi (succeeding ""Olympus"" director Antoine Fuqua) and a platoon of credited screenwriters came up with the concept of putting not only the president in peril but slaughtering a whole bunch of world leaders gathered in London for the funeral of the British prime minister. Somehow the entire security apparatus in Britain has been thoroughly compromised by an evil (but very well-tailored) genius terrorist leader (Alon Moni Aboutboul). Uniformed gunmen are running wild in the streets and Butlers character has his hands full trying to keep the president alive. Breaking necks sticking knives in people and shooting and shooting and shooting (sometimes the president gets in on the gunplay action) he cuts a swath. The action is pumped up. The destruction is extreme. The whole thing is absurd. Soren Andersen 206-464-2358 or sandersenseattletimes.com Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights delivered weekday mornings.

(Grammercy Pictures/Focus Features via AP) Share Photo""London Has Fallen"" never pretends to be anything its not. The sequel to Antoine Fuquas big dumb and kind of fun ""Olympus Has Fallen"" is bigger dumber jaw-droppingly shameless and also kind of a riot. It is just so spectacularly cliched and over-the-top that all you can do is laugh.The craziest thing is how they convinced everyone to reprise their roles. A dare? Fond memories? Or perhaps the 161 million worldwide box office receipts didnt hurt either. In any event Aaron Eckhart is back as U.S. President Benjamin Asher Angela Bassett as Lynne the Secret Service Director Morgan Freeman as the Vice President and of course Gerard Butler as Secret Service Agent Mike Banning -- the guy who saved the country from an improbably big assault on the White House just three years ago.The only one missing is director Antoine Fuqua and you feel it. Hes been replaced with Swedish director Babak Najafi in his English-language debut. Fuqua might not have been at his best with ""Olympus Has Fallen"" but hes still a skilled director. ""London Has Fallen"" is a lot more cartoony.This time the president Mike and Lynn head off to London for the funeral of the British prime minister where 40 other heads of state are expected. And as is wont for the unluckiest administration in history theres a large-scale hyper-coordinated attack in the moments before the funeral as the terrorists pick off world leaders in various comical locations around the city. The French PM is on a luxury motor boat with champagne the Japanese PM is stuck in traffic on a bridge and the older Italian PM is up on the rooftop of Westminster Abbey with his young girlfriend because ""you only turn 30 once.""One of the only ones to get out alive is the U.S. president and he and Mike begin an unbelievable run around the city to try to find safety. All thats missing was a montage of them trying on some civilian clothes so that they arent running around the desolate streets in their ""hey Im the president and his protector three-piece navy suits."" That sadly does not happen.Anyone who saw the first one knows that this is not an action movie thats based in any sort of reality. Its an action movie based on other action movies. The lines are big the jokes are dumb the through-the-temple shots and ensuing blood splatter gratuitous the logic infuriating and the gunfire relentless. At one point when Mike and the President are in relative safety Mike confirms to a terrorist via intercom that yes he is the one with the president.Mike also might be a murderous sociopath. When President Ben asks what hes made of he says ""bourbon and bad decisions."" He also prefers the close contact knife kill to simple gun shots and makes jokes like ""I knew youd come out of the closet sometime"" when the president emerges to save him from a terrorist.The terrorists by the way are led by a powerful international arms dealer (Alon Moni Aboutboul) who is out for vengeance after a drone strike targeting him ended up killing his daughter at her wedding. For such an epic and comprehensive operation his goals are fuzzy at best. Its a wonder how he was able to turn all those British police and royal guards into his own personal army with a vague ""change the world"" message.But thats too much thinking for a movie that is ultimately just mindless bluster. It remains so-bad-its-good fun too until the final third which devolves into some troubling Middle Eastern stereotypes and rah-rah American patriotic posturing as contrast.This sort of movie was made for television viewing. You could tune in or out at any moment and really not miss anything. Or just have a drink beforehand and bring your rowdiest friends to the theater.""London Has Fallen"" a Gramercy Pictures release is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""strong violence and language throughout.""

"London Has Fallen Taking another stab at this premise was a mistake - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies London Has Fallen review Taking another stab at this premise was a mistake London Has Fallen trailer Watch the official trailer for ""London Has Fallen."" Watch the official trailer for ""London Has Fallen."" Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune After the fake (and occasionally authentic) cultural import of the annual Academy Awards it should be refreshing to watch Gerard Butler shoot stab and wisecrack a slew of anonymous Middle Eastern terrorists to death in ""London Has Fallen."" But the frenzied sequel to 2013s ""Olympus Has Fallen"" returning Butler to his security detail in the role of the U.S. presidents infallible protector works on a very low level of bloodthirsty escapism. Around the midpoint long after London had fallen and couldnt get up without Butlers help I was ready to escape the escapism.Butler seems to love pretend-stabbing people. Per the script he does it constantly in ""London Has Fallen"" squish squish to the eyeball Splurch splurch over and over into the nearest terrorist thigh or gut The way he performs these acts of violence Butlers Mike Banning is not just a man of Special Forces killing skills; hes one step this side of sociopath and the occasional wisecracks (""Things are gonna get sporty"" he says I think at one point though the Scottish natives Yank dialect has its muddy patches) only make him less relatable as an action hero. London Has Fallen Focus Features Gerard Butler and Aaron Eckhart in ""London Has Fallen."" Gerard Butler and Aaron Eckhart in ""London Has Fallen."" (Focus Features) When the president (Aaron Eckhart once again) attends the funeral of the British prime minister he and a collection of world leaders come under siege in an astonishingly well-coordinated act of terrorism masterminded by a Pakistani arms dealer (Alon Aboutboul). This is inconvenient for Banning whose pregnant wife (Radha Mitchell) just wants her man back safely.Along with Butler Eckhart and Mitchell the returning ""Olympus"" alums include Morgan Freeman now bumped up to vice president though we all know he should be playing God at the very least; Angela Bassett as Bannings security colleague; Melissa Leo who ekes out a few lines as the defense secretary; and Robert Forster as a general with similarly criminally little to do except stare at video monitors of digital carnage. The Iranian-born director of ""London Has Fallen"" Babak Najafi was a late addition to the project. The film with its wearying gamer-style rounds of death is routine at best. This ones strictly for Butler fans and for R-rated action audiences hungry for a scenario in which the good and mostly white people pick off the brown completely inhumanly bad people by the dozen. Check out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune. One topic of potential future study ""London Has Fallen"" might set the record for the most on-screen location and character identifiers in a single film.

Gerard Butler returns as Mike Banning who true to the cliche is on the verge of retiring from the Secret Service when terrorists strike in ""London Has Fallen."" Photo Courtesy Of Gramercy Pictures London Has Fallen and fallen and fallen 1 / 1 Back to Gallery When viewing the action thriller ""London Has Fallen"" theres no escaping the reality that youve seen everything on the screen before -- many many times. For every bullet and you will lose count there is a cliche. Its not that the by-the-numbers film is unwatchable and all movies borrow from the past but ""London"" sets the bar low for creative inspiration. This lack of originality should come as no surprise given that ""London"" is the sequel to ""Olympus Has Fallen"" which was already tired when it came out three years ago. Where ""Olympus"" laid siege to Washington D.C. the latest adventure leaves the British capital in ruins thanks to terrorists who can kill heads of state and blow up well-guarded landmarks with the flick of a wrist. The considerable wreckage makes the work of the aliens in ""Independence Day"" look amateurish. There to save the day though is Secret Service agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) whose default personality trait is kick-ass. Before being dispatched to London Banning is on the verge of hanging up his Secret Service boots as is required in worn-out screenplays. Naturally an attack of global proportions occurs and Banning cant reunite with his expectant wife because he must protect endangered U.S. President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart) whom the terrorists want as the star in their new beheading video. The film hopes to woo us with its CGI effects of bombarded London and Bannings gunbattles with an army of terrorists but they come off as perfunctory. As usual in American action films these days its hard to decipher whats going on during the ferocious firefights; we just watch and wait patiently (or impatiently) as the body count piles up. Director Babak Najafi tries to whip up some fun banter between Banning and the president but most of the time Butler and Eckhart cant pull it off. These actors look physically similar and when theyre together they cancel each other out. Most of their problem is bad chemistry Eckharts temperament seems more suited for a football coach than a head of state and Butler consistently falls flat when he tries to deliver a droll line. It makes you appreciate the skills of Bruce Willis in ""Die Hard"" or Kiefer Sutherland in ""24."" There will be few films this year that squander such a formidable supporting cast. Morgan Freeman who has portrayed convincing leaders in the past seems to be channeling his chauffeur from ""Driving Miss Daisy"" instead of a resolute vice president. Hes the last to arrive in the situation room and apparently missed all the awful developments on the TV news. The performances of Melissa Leo and Robert Forster appear to have ended up on the editing floor with a total of about three unmemorable lines between them. Another great actor Angela Bassett (slumming it) is a nonfactor too. But thats probably a good thing for these thespians because the more screen time actors get in this film the worse impression they make. The briskly paced ""London"" has one thing going for it or against it depending on your point of view. It feeds on the nations current fears about Middle Eastern people and about the level of terrorism threat within our borders.

Share Tweet ""Go back to Fuckheadistan"" growls Neanderthal Secret Service agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) as he knifes a faceless goon about halfway through the grab bag of dog-whistles and dog-shit filmmaking that is London Has Fallen. One of the cheapest looking 100 million movies ever made this sequel to the 2013 sort-of-hit Olympus Has Fallen ditches the originals ""Die Hard in the White House"" premise in favor of sub-Death Wish 3 sadism and Red Dawn-esque survivalism but without the notes of camp or jingoist pulp that could make either watchable. Instead Swedish director Babak Najafi (Easy Money Hard To Kill) has thrown together one of the worst action movies in recent memory its signal achievement being a firefight thats presented in a single take but which still manages to be incomprehensible. Perhaps the movies politics--which range from tone deaf to irredeemable--would be more of an issue if it werent so inept.London Has Fallen finds Banning and his best bro President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart) flying out to the British capital for a state funeral soon revealed to be a set-up for a very poorly explained terrorist invasion. Indeterminably Arab evildoers appear to have infiltrated Londons police and emergency services in order to kill world leaders in ludicrous ways like blowing up Westminster Abbey while the Italian prime minister is sightseeing or trying to shoot Marine One out of the air with a rocket launcher. (This may sound like the stuff of an over-the-top action movie but London Has Fallen has a way of turning gonzo set pieces into listless patience-testers.) The bad guys motive To avenge bystanders killed by a drone strike. At this point the reader is invited to take some time to fully take in this dumpster of xenophobia in which the bugaboo of immigrants ""taking"" jobs is explicitly conflated with terrorism and brown people are scary enough to turn humanitarian issues into threats to international safety.Najafi is himself a former refugee from the Middle East--a fact that might qualify as a fascinating contradiction if anything about the movie suggested awareness self- or otherwise. A murky brain-dead stab-a-thon packed with so many inane chases laughable special effects and mismatched stock footage shots that it begs to be made into a drinking game London Has Fallen is one of those rare films that is good at absolutely nothing. Its aesthetic is cut-rate anonymity of the kind sometimes associated with direct-to-video movies (it was partly shot in Sofia which is the capital of both Bulgaria and the low-budget action industry) and crappy TV. The Oval Office looks like a business tycoons mansion in a soap opera and every shot of a building exterior or rushing ambulance appears to have been bought from Getty or Shutterstock. The surreal side effect of the wall-to-wall use of licensed stock footage--much of it featuring passersby--is that it makes it seem as though no one cares that half of Londons landmarks have been blown up and all of Europes heads of state are dead.While our intrepid heroes head down a succession of dim corridors and narrow streets the movie periodically cuts to overqualified supporting actors--including Morgan Freeman Melissa Leo and Robert Forster--so they can stare at a screen and say the plot out loud. (As it turns out its possible to write something that will sound like garbage even when spoken in Freemans sonorous voice.) Its difficult to imagine that even an ideal audience--i.e. people who harbor fantasies of being best friends with a president whos willing to kick some ass and also believe that todays action movies dont feature enough knife fighting--would find much to get excited about in London Has Fallen. For a movie that is so fixated on letting Banning inflict pain on the enemies of the West its surprisingly squeamish about gore qualifying for an R rating only on account of a few too many stilted fucks. What viewers get instead is an ersatz approximation of a violent power fantasy Banning glowering uncontrollably as masked thugs of implied Middle Eastern origin lunge at him and are killed just out of frame leading President Asher to yelp out some variation on ""Jesus Mike Did you have to kill that guy?"" before being reminded that yes he did. And so they trudge on indifferently framed by Najafis camera which serves only to prove that a truly bad director doesnt need shaky handheld or rapid cuts to make incoherent action.

As Secret Service agent Mike Banning Gerard Butler played the Bruce Willis role rescuing captive President Mike Asher (Aaron Eckhart) from a gang of terrorists. The new sequel London Has Fallen implausibly ups its predecessors stakes to Die Hard in the City of London. Unfortunately widening the scope this dramatically causes the entire fragile action-movie axis to spin wildly out of control. When the movie begins Banning is thinking of quitting the Secret Service to spend more time with his wife (Radha Mitchell) and their expected baby. But naturally disaster strikes. The English Prime Ministers death requires all world leaders to assemble in London for a state funeral. Incredibly London streets are not shut down or so much as cordoned off leaving global dignitaries (accompanied by perhaps one security guard each) stuck in traffic. This makes them vulnerable to a sudden attack by a terrorist network that has somehow managed to infiltrate the London police force. These terrorists assassinate most of these world leaders and also blow up a bunch of monuments for some reason. Asher and Banning escape but just barely. They then have to make their way through the streets of London (which went from overcrowded to wasteland empty in about five minutes) to the safety of the U.S. embassy all while dodging the remaining terrorists. They finally find a helpful MI6 agent (Charlotte Riley) and occasionally receive dispatches from Vice President Allan Trumbull which doesnt seem to help anyone very much but is a good excuse to get Morgan Freeman in the movie. By casting its villain as a suspiciously ISIS-like Middle Eastern terrorist network London Has Fallen makes itself into a political movie--but its politics are heinous. The whole global conflict is set in motion by an opening sequence in which the U.S. military authorized by Asher drone-strikes a Pakistani wedding in hopes of killing international arms dealer Aamir Barkawi (Alon Moni Aboutboul). This blatant war crime is not only completely unsuccessful at killing Barkawi (instead inspiring his wide-scale revenge attack) its also never criticized or questioned. When the terrorists mention it Asher derides their justified anger as ""insanity."" At one point Banning even tells one of the terrorists to ""head back to F--headistan or wherever youre from."" (Incidentally this racism extends to the terrorists speaking accented English the whole movie where the European leaders are given the luxury of subtitles). There is not a single reference to ""radical Islam"" but the way Barkawi and Trumbull talk London Has Fallens plot is unmistakably meant to simulate a ""clash of civilizations."" But even beyond the politics London Has Fallens action doesnt make sense. At one point Banning takes out a whole heavily armed Delta-Force squad of terrorists with nothing but a knife. None of these commandos so much as shoot at him and in fact seem quite content to let him take them out one by one. Some of these action sequences are shot so confusingly that Banning appears to be multiple people. The movie asks for too much suspension of disbelief. A trained violence-prone cop like John McClane taking out an unprepared goon squad is one thing; one raging idiot with a knife massacring a city-wide army of terrorists is quite another. Banning even tries McClanes tactic of radioing the terrorist leader to mock him but in this case it serves absolutely no strategic purpose. It does give Butler the chance to say ""f--"" a lot though which the film seems to think is quite funny. London Has Fallens main characters have a strange disregard for technology. They scoff at YouTube and undefined ""social media"" although maybe if they had paid more attention to Twitter they would have known that terrorists were planning a massive attack on a global metropolis. Instead the movie posits that the solution to every problem is the classic heroic daydream that a bad guy with a gun can be stopped by a good guy with a gun. Only in a movie whose characters manage to walk away from helicopter crashes grenade launchers fiery explosions and near-decapitations with nary a scratch is that fantasy a remote possibility.

TWITTER 3/4/2016 Many of those who enjoyed Gerard Butlers disgraced Secret Service agent single-handedly saving president Aaron Eckharts butt the first time will likely turn up to see him do it all over again. Far more than London Bridge falls down in London Has Fallen the latest entry in the major world capitals destruction porn sub-genre. Arriving roughly three years after its progenitor Olympus Has Fallen surprised everyone and particularly the makers of White House Down by grossing 161 million worldwide this budget-conscious high-octane action piece verily zips along at such a fierce clip that its over practically before you know it. Many of those who enjoyed Gerard Butlers disgraced secret service agent single-handedly saving president Aaron Eckharts butt the first time will likely turn up to see him do it all over again. As is their wont the terrorists have become more sophisticated and ambitious this time bringing one world capital and many world leaders to their knees with a long-aborning plot. In Olympus it was the North Koreans who were up to no good but here its a wealthy Eastern arms merchant out to avenge and humble the West. In this the bad guys are initially successful in a way that for anyone who knows and loves London is distressing and depressing to behold. To be sure the visual effects here are nowhere near the level of something like Inception or Dawn of the Planet of the Apes but they are just good enough to present a realistic idea of what it would be like to see Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament blown to smithereens. And thats just for starters. Of course everyone has their reasons and the motive of the main heavy a drippingly rich and malevolent Pakistani Aamir Barkawi (Alon Moni Aboutboul) is to exact revenge for the West having killed his daughter and many others at her lavish wedding where he was the main target. The trigger he devises is to use the death of the British Prime Minister which he has secretly arranged to bring all the top Western leaders to one place for the funeral and drop the hammer on them all there. As he declares ""Vengeance must always be profound and absolute."" Not that the occupants of the White House are oblivious to the possible danger. Eckharts President Benjamin Asher and his staff which includes not only Butlers Secret Service agent Mike Banning but also the returning Angela Bassetts Secret Service Director Robert Forsters top general Melissa Leos Secretary of Defense and Morgan Freemans vice president (promoted from Speaker of the House in the wake of the former veeps death) are supremely wary of the trip but the Western leaders must show up to honor a close ally. Despite every imaginable precaution however things begin going boom on the afternoon of the funeral; the only thing that emerges clearly from the hell storm is that there had to have been significant enemy infiltration of Britains security forces. As the world television audience witnesses the mayhem several heads of state are killed while Benning tries to spirit the President by chopper back to the waiting Air Force One. They dont make it instead landing on foot somewhere on the outskirts of London with no choice but to battle their way back into the city block by block and reach the American Embassy. The bad guys led locally by Barkawis son (Waleed F. Zuaiter) have a different idea which is to kidnap the President and get the highest ratings in history by executing him on television. Its all high-concept pulp but unfortunately not an inconceivable stretch in theory given the kinds of previously unimaginable barbarities that have recently taken place and been broadcast to an insatiable online public. While not nearly as elaborate nor as visually sophisticated as the last Mission Impossible outing or the most recent Bonds London Has Fallen is actually more plausible at its core if not in its details which is partly why it succeeds in laying claim to an audiences attention for the entirety of its swift running time. Iranian-born Swedish director Babak Najafi who previously did Easy Money II and here took over the franchise reins from Antoine Fuqua maintains a hard-driving pace without descending into frantic narrative illogic and hits the right tone that allows Butler to get off a load of rude reassuring one-liners. The originals writers Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt were aided and abetted here by Christian Gudegast and Chad St. John. Butler manfully dispenses justice here many times over and even if the other main actors are in it strictly for the paycheck theyve all been in a whole lot worse in their time.

""By seeing London I have seen as much of life as the world can show"" said Samuel Johnson in 1773 as quoted by biographer James Boswell. By seeing ""London Has Fallen"" on the other hand Johnson may conversely have marveled at a veritable cornucopia of death -- the grisly indiscriminate slaying of world leaders and common men the swift pulverization of city infrastructure and the slower decimation of any unsuspecting viewers brain cells. Aiming low and still managing to limbo its way under that bar Babak Najafis cement-headed sequel to 2013s POTUS-in-peril thriller ""Olympus Has Fallen"" shifts and expands the battleground from the White House to the Big Smoke while maintaining a cozily American jingoism in its narrative scope and stakes. Cruddily crafted grimacingly performed and effortlessly racist this sloppy dish of Gruel Britannia may just go down well enough to green-light a continuing franchise of global destruction. World capitals quiver. Three years ago to the month action journeyman Antoine Fuquas ""Olympus Has Fallen"" reaped the benefits of a modest budget and minimal expectations. Released months ahead of Roland Emmerichs far wittier more accomplished but near-identically plotted ""White House Down"" ""Olympus"" was pegged as the cheapjack warm-up act for a predicted summer smash -- only to wind up outgrossing Emmerichs superior slab of cheese by nearly 30 million. Even within the exclusive realm of bad taste theres no accounting for it. Now with Iranian-born Swede Najafi (""Easy Money II ""Hard to Kill"") filling in for Fuqua ""London Has Fallen"" arrives with only the unimposing memory of its predecessor to compete against. Somehow it falls short. Where ""Olympus"" was at least cloddishly good-humored in its ""Die Hard"" stylings theres something coldly snarling and vindictive about its sequels flag-waving -- not to mention a presumptuousness that global auds will invest equally in its on-screen fight for American leaders and freedoms at any cost to those of other nations. London certainly provides an attractive backdrop to the carnage If youre going to blow up any thoroughfare after all it may as well be one as storied and scenic as Chelsea Bridge while the Houses of Parliament look smashing even when smashed to suboptimal CG smithereens. In no other sense is Blighty flattered here however as the pics story (by returning scribes Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt) hinges on the countrys government police force and intelligence service being unreservedly inept corrupt or some combination of the two. No wonder Secret Service director Lynne Jacobs (Angela Bassett thanklessly stentorian as ever) discourages Aaron Eckharts President Benjamin Asher from leaving the eternally secure confines of the U.S. when Britains Prime Minister unexpectedly drops dead. Must he really attend the poor Limeys funeral? Wont a nice wreath from Interflora do? Bloody-minded diplomat that he is Asher insists on showing his transatlantic solidarity in person -- with his trusty venison-bodied protection agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) in tow to guard him against bumbling British incompetence and devious terrorist machinations of farther-flung origin. While North Korea was the enemy in ""Olympus"" ""London"" predictably reverts to familiar Islamophobia as infamous Pakistani arms dealer Aamir Barkawi (Alon Moni Aboutboul) vows vengeance on the West for a drone strike that -- as depicted in a sun-scorched pre-credit sequence -- fatally ruined his daughters wedding. A solemn gathering of world leaders at St. Pauls Cathedral provides the perfect opportunity; in short order terrorist minions in bobby-on-the-beat disguise are gunning down civilians in the street revered London landmarks are crumbling to dubiously digitized dust and the German French Italian and Japanese heads of state have all joined their British counterpart at the great global summit in the sky. (Dont mourn the Italian though -- were shown he was a total lech.) As London goes into lockdown the citys darkening streets effectively become an ever-less-distinct obstacle course for Asher and Banning breathlessly dodging Barkawis clutches as Vice-President Morgan Freeman and senior staff Melissa Leo Robert Forster and Jackie Earle Haley twiddle their white-knuckled thumbs back in D.C. (One would complain that theyre underused though perhaps the greater offense is that such fine actors are being used for this tripe at all.) For all the slicing and dicing of the editing narrative momentum grinds to a trudge after the synthetic spectacle of the capitals undoing. Bar one careering helicopter chase Najafi and his quartet of screenwriters havent drawn up many action set pieces that extend beyond Butler lustily cracking skulls and hawking in a semi-Scots brogue as American as apple pie such apparently cheer-worthy lines as ""Get back to F--kheadistan or wherever it is youre from."" There may well be viewers receptive to this ugly brand of reactionary fear-mongering which -- thanks to a release date postponed from last October -- can claim accidental topicality in the wake of Novembers horrific Paris attacks. But thats not to credit a scrap of cultural or political perspicacity to a film in which seasoned White House advisors observe with wonder that a massive terrorist strike on the U.K. is ""all over social media too."" A film this incurious about the world it demolishes is perhaps smarter when it plays dumb though even at its most purely physical ""London Has Fallen"" remains short on style rhythm or even tacky formal bravado Ed Wilds widescreen lensing often swamped in all that translucent-looking effects work trades in smeary shades of steel while the marching-band thrum of Trevor Morriss score steers sternly clear of memorable riffs. For better or worse it says much about the remit of ""London Has Fallen"" that a film starring such potentially fascinating thesps as Freeman Eckhart and Leo permits its most fully realized performance to be given by Butler -- nothing if not a committed kicker of ass even as his 2016 filmography still sweat-drenched from the debatable exertions of ""Gods of Egypt"" perversely races itself to the bottom. What moments of conviction this silly-yet-cynical pic has belong to him albeit usually in service of its most vacantly chest-beating sentiments. ""Assholes like you have been trying to kill us for a long time"" he growls to one villain-by-numbers ""but in a thousand years well still be here."" With any luck this franchise will not.

I will admit without feeling bad about it that I have never seen this film. But I can probably say I would enjoy it a little bit at least. I swear that anytime I read a ""critics"" review on a movie and it gets horrible ratings I end up LOVING the movie. And the movies these so called ""critics"" give the thumbs up to usually either put me to sleep or make me want to vomit the same vile way that they do on a daily basis towards good films. If you truly LOVE film TV Broadway or anything of the sort then learn to NEVER listen to a critic. Their uppity false sense of self is sickening. The only good thing I have found about critics like this ""critic"" is that whatever they say....take it as wrong. I have learned through life and listening to these so called critics who are supposed to be professional and relate to the populace with their expertise that 99.9% of the time they get it wrong. My rule as far as critics and movies go is this and its very simple....critic gives a thumbs up....the movie is usually horribly boring and I cant make it through the entire movie in the theatre or at home. If a critic gives a horrible review then most likely its a GREAT movie that many people will love. TO DUMB UP MY COMMENT....oops worry I meant...to sum up my comments and opinions.....these critics are ridiculous have no true soul and should NOT be paid for their lame reviews. If society leaned on critics soley for their opinions on what to watch we would have a society of half witted Neanderthals watching movies. Reply Victoria says April 28 2016 at 244 pm Just saw it today knowing nothing about it beforehand. THOROUGHLY enjoyed it. So tired of snotty critics. Would definitely recommend this movie Reply Todd Everett says April 23 2016 at 529 pm Just saw it at a second-run theater and had a terrific time. -- the picture was over-the-top in (as I saw it) a knowing way like Roadrunner cartoons and my favorite not-quite Dirty Harry Clint Eastwood film ""The Gauntlet."" Sometimes a movie is just a movie... Reply Michael James Cobb says April 18 2016 at 433 pm It was a pretty good film. Be cautious if you see the word ""racist"" in a review. It generally means that the reviewers political sensibilities have outweighed his or her professionalism. In the present case it the movie is about a terrorist act. In Europe. With wanton murder and destruction. Who do you think was responsible? The Baptists? Reply Amir mohammed says April 17 2016 at 914 am I thought it was a good film.if you wanted cinderella then watch that instead. Its a action film expect action . Reply Jenna Stewart says April 15 2016 at 217 pm Another words the author made a pass at Butler and he rebuked him. Reply scarygamecocks says April 15 2016 at 203 am Are you a film critic or the P.C. police? Reply Greg Price says April 12 2016 at 1021 am This film is ""racist"" because Islamic terrorists dont exist...riiiight...Islamics NEVER do this sort of thing... Someone needs to get out more if they fall for that. Reply Kellen says March 29 2016 at 124 am Well thats definitely going to send several people I know to the theatre to watch it. I think youre taking this movie far too seriously accidental topicality? Heaven save us it could only be topical if anyone assumed it had anything whatever to do with reality. Its an action movie wherein as apparently everyone but you knows the bad guys are invariably criminal or insane or both since remotely normal people dont resolve their personal issues by blowing complete strangers noted or otherwise into the sweet by-and-byand couldnt afford an army of suicidal/homicidal henchmen to carry out their megalomaniacal plans anyway. The politicians/police/civil servants are all corrupt or clueless except one maverick who believes/helps out the hero -- because if they were as competent as they are in RL youd have a four-minute movie which isnt likely to be profitable. The good guys -- unless we lose one to provide a tug at the heartstrings -- manage to survive everything short of a direct hit with an atomic bomb dispose of the henchmen with an efficiency and insouciance most of us secretly wish we could find in ourselves when dealing with in-laws who came from hell in a first class compartment and go home to live happily ever after. The villain very much unlike RL comes to a very definite end -- unless theres the possibility of a sequel of course. The language is usually risque at best -- but the plots of action movies are unlikely enough without the hero (or heroes) declaiming ""Bird thou never wert"" or snippets from Shakespeare and a blunt if crude hero is infinitely to be preferred to the politically correct version who witters on about her/his distaste for violence -- despite using it with an effortlessness that would leave Hannibal Lecter in need of smelling salts -- until you long to send her/him the e-mail address of New Careers. Incidentally I found the beginning awkward for the same reason you found it reprehensible if putting his family at risk wasnt on the villains preferred options list he could have considered a somewhat less dangerous career choice. But as I say -- its an action movie. I expect sense out of fact-based outings like Selma not updated versions of the John Wayne western. Reply Harvey davidson says March 27 2016 at 1253 pm Us ordinary inert hillbilly hicks rednecks etc reject critics views and the lower their rating the more we like them has nothing to do with whether its racist or not we figure the higher the rating the more mind numbing BORING it will be because it is not for the common person but for the sophisticated we like more action and less drama and less music and dialogue we like what you probably call crap Reply syzito says March 23 2016 at 914 am Hey Islam isnt a raceits a religious belief system based on the ancient Arabic moon god thats why the Muslim flag has a crescent moon on it. Reply Responsible Critic says March 13 2016 at 546 pm Yes -- too much swearing. For Guy Lodge to consider this movie racist leads one to believe that he hates America or is uneducated as a critic. From the looks of him on the web he looks just like the British traitor in the movie. For him to hate America so much he must be mad at his mom or dad and needs something to vent on. One may also think he would dodge his responsibility to serve his country. Strap hangar critics come a dime a dozen. Reply kp (kushka53) says March 12 2016 at 755 pm ""Cruddily crafted?"" and in bold face no less. Anyone actually check this copy? Try CRUDELY Reply guylodge says March 13 2016 at 340 pm Per Oxford Reference cruddy adj. [crud n. + sfx -y] 1 (also crud crudding) useless no good second-rate. ""Crudely"" would also have been an appropriate choice of adverb but was not the one intended. . Reply steven ramos says April 20 2016 at 1107 pm Let me guess. You were pretty harsh on die hard too? Internet critics are on war paths to try and kill action movies. They want everything to be ""the Danish girl"" or ""the Kings speech"". Wake up. My generation has a respect for both. They both have a place. Fortunately enough only senior citizens seem to be affected by reviews. patrick king says March 11 2016 at 1108 pm If everything in the movie was the same but the terrorists were actually white Christian fundamentalists you would be talking about how great the movie is and it would probably win an Oscar for best picture. Reply Chris Luke says March 11 2016 at 932 am The movie may stink but not for its alleged racism or xenophobia. This reviewer lives in a reality-free zone like most leftists. Last time I checked Muslims are the only real plausible villains these days for a movie like this. ""Islamaphobia is a myth. That I reality. Reply Lady Grantham Downton Abbey says March 10 2016 at 438 am I suppose a film reviewer who decries racism whilst simultaneously describing my compatriots as Limeys could be termed a drivelling turd-brained hypocrite - but that would be impolite. Reply Caitlin says March 7 2016 at 916 pm Um you might want to spell capitol right in the headline. Not capital. Just saying Reply guylodge says March 7 2016 at 935 pm capitol a building in which a state legislative body meets capital a city serving as a seat of government Per Merriam-Webster and I intend the latter but thanks for checking. Reply Al stone says March 6 2016 at 1116 am I hope the reviewer and editors read these comments and takes to heart the message; people are tired of liberal pc nonsense infecting every review. It has to stop. Reply Alex Interian says March 6 2016 at 1210 am The critic is of course just another stupid liberal. This movie is great fun. Cheesy yes but hardly racist. It is reflective of the world we live in today. Islamic extremists are the enemy... and to portray otherwise is truly stupid and inaccurate. Reply Greg Karraker says March 5 2016 at 958 pm This review would be better suited for AlJazeeraUSA than Variety. As an action film it had quality stunts CGI and pacing. It lacked credibility as many action films do but the film actually showed considerable PC restraint in depicting the perps as greedy arms dealers rather than genuine jihad monkeys who embody this centurys Pareto principle for evil. Reply Richard A Hill says March 5 2016 at 234 pm Mr. Lodge This is the WORST Freaking review I have EVER READ. Your pacifistic snot is all over the page. How about acting? or How GOOD were the special effects?and How believable were the characters? Islamaphobia ??? Did this film ALL Muslims as the enemy? (NO it did not) Was all of the stupidity in the film restricted to Muslim characters ? NO it was not Another joke to ""Lodge"" at your expense. Get a new job. As a film reviewer youre the joke. and PS - BOTH ""Olympus has fallen"" and White house down"" were excellent films One for fans that like to listen a lot and one for fans that like to watch things happening. You .. I neither wish to listen to or read. I will learn to forgo and ignore any more Variety Mistakes e.g. allowing you to review films. Reply Jim Sunye says March 3 2016 at 946 pm Guy- Its so great to see filmakers dispencing with this insane political correctness that requires all bad guys to either be N Korean or white and from an unamed eastern European country. We all know who the terrorists are. No harm comes from saying it out loud. Calling things as they are and not how we would prefer them to be is realism. Anytime I read a review like yours that tags a movie as having a racist perspective my PC radar goes up and I become more interested in seeing the movie. 300 was attacked mercilessly and for what? Look how great it did. Nobody wants a racist movie or one that perpetuates stereotypes. But enough with the PC garbage. Let the movie suck on its own merits. Reply Tim says March 2 2016 at 754 pm Absolutely unbelievable review Variety should can this writers ___ Reply Greg (mypalfish) says March 2 2016 at 416 pm Its always funny when lefty critics spend more of the review discussing politics than the actual film itself. And btw what exactly does ""islamophobia"" mean? Is it knowing the simple fact that most of the terrorism around the world is committed by Radical Islamic extremists? Reply stevenkovacs says March 2 2016 at 1255 pm Looks like fun Reply Fluff says March 2 2016 at 1013 am The reviewers use of the non word Islamophobia discredits him entirely and reveals his leftist lemming leanings. Im all the more eager to see the film. Reply Lawrence says March 2 2016 at 945 am Saw it last night and thought it was better than the first one. Mindless action sure but thats what i wanted and thats what I got. This review seems a little pompous. Reply ;lk says March 2 2016 at 944 am White House Down was boring garbage... but it did feature white villains. Therefore its awesome according to the reviewer. Muslims as villains is ""xenophobic"". Movie criticism has completely collapsed. Now nothing more than leftwing politicking... Reply rider2016 says March 2 2016 at 941 am Why does Lodge feel the need to tell us the director is ""Iranian-born"" Do you point out the birthplace of every director you review or are you making a political point of it? Reply Bill says March 2 2016 at 915 am Why would anyone want to pay for what is basically the same bad film again? Reply Greg Price says April 12 2016 at 1034 am Same could be said of Transformers Die Hard Mission Impossible etc etc etc. Reply Clint Bronson says March 2 2016 at 835 am Sorry for typo - it should have read thinkers Reply Clint Bronson says March 2 2016 at 833 am We dont need reactionary fear-mongering film makers to make the tinkers among us aware that Islam poses the greatest threat to western civilisation in its entire history. The Muslim crazies do a perfectly good job. I am SICK of politically-correct idiots bleating about xenophobia and Islamophobia. Reply Jeffo says March 2 2016 at 818 am Hey Guy Lodgedont sugarcoat it -- tell us how you really feel about. Reply Paul says March 2 2016 at 814 am ""effortlessly racist""... ""While North Korea was the enemy in ""Olympus"" ""London"" predictably reverts to familiar Islamophobia as infamous Pakistani arms dealer Aamir Barkawi (Alon Moni Aboutboul) vows vengeance on the West for a drone strike that -- as depicted in a sun-scorched pre-credit sequence -- fatally ruined his daughters wedding"" Is the writer able to explain how the film is racist or Islamophobic? Your article reads as trying to make such links because the terrorists in the film according to this article come from Pakistan. The film hasnt been released yet so I dont know if that is so nor if the terrorists are identified as Islamic but Im bemused by your objecting to the idea Islamic terrorists might just attack the West or that it is Islamophobic to portray that if that is your objection. Presumably it was equally unrealistic and racist to have North Korean terrorists in Olympus Has Fallen. Because like ISIS or Al-Qaeda theyve never made such threats. Reply jsm1963 says March 2 2016 at 1148 am Its lazy and simpleminded. And its been done before. They could have been more creative.

In one ""White House Down"" Channing Tatum did a kind of ""Die Hard in D.C."" saving President Jamie Foxx from an all-out attack. It was dumb but it knew it and that made it kind of smart. In the other ""Olympus Has Fallen"" Gerard Butler was another lone operative saving President Aaron Eckhart from an all-out attack. It was stupid but proud of it - jingoistic and sadistic. Guess which one was successful enough to spawn a sequel? You got that right. And now weve got ""London Has Fallen"" in which Eckhart is again the president and again in trouble and the studly Butler is on hand to happily slaughter all the bad guys. Imagine if hed been around 40 years ago to take out that rabid rabbit. Jimmy Carter might have even won a second term. In the sequel were out of Washington and on to Great Britain where the president has to attend a sudden state funeral. What he doesnt realize though is that the survivor of a recent drone attack is waiting for him. And so are hundreds of the mans fanatical operatives. Like the first film it plays into - and frankly exploits - a lot of lingering 9/11 anguish. You know those terrorists who attacked us? Well here they are again. And this time were going to kill them slowly. The movie unapologetically embraces its own sadism too with Butler not only killing the attackers but relishing it. In one scene he slowly grinds a knife into a mans back - after first holding a phone up to his mouth so the mans brother can hear his screams. The first film was vicious too but at least it had the competent Antoine Fuqua at the helm. For this even crasser sequel hes been replaced by director Babak Najafi who thinks that if four people with assault weapons are good than 40 are even better. And lets add some grenade-launchers too. Nothing succeeds like excess. Well he succeeds in filling the screen with noise and fire all right but the action is indistinguishable; we cant even see whos shooting too particularly when everything moves to a dark alley. (All the better to conceal that most of this isnt London at all but Sofia Bulgaria.) Gerard Butler fresh from ""Gods of Egypt"" is once again running around and sweating and grimacing and good at it although to call him a comic-book hero is to insult comic books. As the president all the chiseled-chin Eckhart does is make you marvel at how well Harvey Dents last campaign must have gone. But the film cheaps out on the rest of the cast using a lot of economically unfamiliar people to play the English good guys and Middle Eastern bad guys. The supporting American stars - Morgan Freeman and Melissa Leo among them - are all stuck back on a single set in D.C. in pointless hastily shot scenes of them watching it all unfold on a giant video screen. Im surprised none of them thought of changing to a different channel. I sure did. Ratings note The film contains gory violence and strong language. London Has Fallen (R) Focus (99 min.) Directed by Babak Najafi. With Gerard Butler Morgan Freeman. Now playing in New Jersey.  1/2 Stephen Whitty may be reached at stephenjwhittygmail.com. Follow him on Twitter stephenwhitty.

In the case of London Has Fallen not really mainly because this sequel to Olympus Has Fallen is so joyously ridiculous. This time the US President (Aaron Eckhart) is travelling to London with secret agent and ultimate bro Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) for the state funeral of the British Prime Minister. Soon after they land the city is ablaze with bombs. It turns out terrorists have manipulated the event as an opportunity to assassinate every single world leader in the least subtle way imaginable. Time to get the President outta there. London Has Fallen is laced with as many cliches as the original the President mainly speaks in heartfelt speeches about looking out for the citizens of the United States and Butler more a likeable lad-on-tour than a stern secret agent has lines that span from Nothings wrong it bugs the hell out of me to Make those fuckers pay. Dishearteningly there are very few female characters beyond Angela Bassetts powerful secret-service director and Charlotte Rileys flirty MI6 agent. Still if you embrace the movies GI Joe-style fun swagger theres novelty value in seeing London through the lens of a global action movie. The story takes in the Queens Guard the London Underground and pretty much every stop on a tourist-bus tour. It feels like the writers worked their way through a guidebook ticking off which landmarks to blow up. Sweeping aerial views give the city an air of bombastic grandeur and the likes of St Pauls Cathedral are decimated with the same vigour as was applied to the White House in Independence Day. Its all so overly macho that it plays like a camp pleasure-cruise.

But you can tell something sinister is simmering. The first 10 to 15 minutes or so is just a normal intro to a film background stories etc. However things take a sharp turn for the worst and London begins to fall (pun intended.) The next 70 minutes or so is pretty much filled with shootings stabbings grenades and bombs; with some super fast driving lots of killings and some screaming from Angela Bassett. I liked this film because it was almost surreal to see our famous and well loved monuments falling so rapidly and so destructively. It almost felt too real at some points But dont get me wrong this film was HIGHLY predictable and if youve seen the first one you knew just what to expect. Gerrard Butler and Aaron Eckhart display the warm dependable relationship we came to love in the first film (Olympus Has Fallen) and the bromance is carried through to this film. Gerard has rather filled out and that neck alone was a weapon in itself Something I thought was boring and typical was the usual East are the villains and West are the heroes. Wouldnt it be more realistic if they showed some homegrown terrorists as seems to be more the case these days? Just my thoughts.

This film is nothing special but is entertaining enough and if youve seen Olympus is fallen you should know what to expect.  My main criticism is that there are too many baddies in it - I felt a bit offended that they could suggest MY London could have so many people happy to take part in the destruction without MI5 being in any way aware of it  It also left several key questions - Why did the presidents car go left out of Somerset House to get to St Pauls???  Cunning ploy to put off any attackers or blooper??Where is that entrance to Charing Cross station??Saturday afternoon (before the attacks started)  why was there only about 30 people in Trafalgar Square??What on earth does Im thirsty as f mean???New British Prime Minister Clarkson??? Jeremy??Would even the Italian Prime Minister stop off on the way to a funeral to have a quick tour up the top of Westminster Abbey with a woman half his age (OK maybe Ill let them have this one but I dont think the French president would fancy a random chill out on a boat just before the funeral)The special effects arent particularly good but if you like action and it doesnt bother you that they are good shots until it comes to shooting at the main characters then I think you would enjoy this film.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMar 5 2016GeorgeXTastemakerFeaturedWhat a disappointment..I cant believe how Gerard Butler agreed on playing on this film. Extremely bad special effects - you could easily make something better on your laptop .The whole footage seems to have been made in a big green room - It is clear that production didnt have any money to do a proper movie. Such a shame - they had made great marketing and I was waiting to see Londons landmarks in danger - instead of that I couldnt wait to leave the cinema...Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMar 3 2016MikeTFeaturedThe trailers a good advert for this movie - it contains all the best bits (as I suppose most trailers do).
