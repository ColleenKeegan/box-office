Barry Wetcher/Warner Bros. Pictures hide caption toggle caption Barry Wetcher/Warner Bros. Pictures Apocalyse soon Will Smith and friend in a post-plague New York. Barry Wetcher/Warner Bros. Pictures Director Francis LawrenceGenre Action/DramaRunning Time 100 minutes Will Smith races around an eerily vacant New York City in this latest Hollywood adaptation of Richard Mathesons novella. A virus modified to cure cancer has mutated into a deadly strain that kills most victims and turns the rest into zombies -- who as zombies generally do seem to like to slam their heads into plate glass when theyre not slaughtering innocents. The isle of Manhattan -- Ground Zero for the plague -- has been quarantined with all its bridges and tunnels dynamited and Smith a virologist searching for a cure is its last uninfected resident. He wanders a New York where he can hunt wild deer grazing on weeds growing in the middle of 5th Avenue during the day but where by night hes forced to hole up with his dog in a barricaded apartment to avoid the citys light-phobic blood-thirsty infected residents. Filmmaker Francis Lawrence and an army of digitizers have stripped New York of its inhabitants to pretty breathtaking effect -- the opening sequence is a wow -- and Smith is terrific at conveying what it might be like to be deprived of human contact for three years while constantly fearing for your life. The scares are effective for a good long while and theres an intriguing terrorism subtext for anyone who wants to read a little real-world relevance into the story.

Hes got a high-powered rifle by his side his German shepherd Sam in the front seat and hes out hunting galloping herds of deer which bounce through the midtown streets now overgrown with weeds and cluttered with deserted cars frozen in permanent gridlock. Smith is playing Robert Neville the last man alive in New York--and perhaps on the planet. A deadly virus the fatally ironic result of a ""cure"" for cancer that backfired has wiped out all but those few who like Neville are immune to the virus.Neville has the run of the city during the day but at night he boards himself up in his Washington Square townhouse. For at night the Infected come out--contaminated humans who have mutated into raging flesh-eating zombie vampires who cannot tolerate daylight. Neville an army scientist praying that there are still other humans out there somewhere is obsessed with finding a cure for the virus. But he needs to capture these vicious mutants to serve as his guinea pigs--a dangerous game to say the least.Directed by Francis (""Constantine"") Lawrence from a screenplay by Mark Protosevich and Akiva Goldsman this is the third attempt to put Richard Mathesons classic 1954 science-fiction novel on the screen. (Neither ""The Last Man on Earth"" in 1964 nor ""The Omega Man"" in 71 was up to the job.) Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Technically ""I Am Legend"" is a mighty impressive achievement. The transformation of New York into a postapocalyptic landscape masterminded by production designer Naomi Shohan and vividly shot by Andrew Lesnie has a haunting desolate plausible beauty. And the screenwriters relying on only a few crucial flashbacks to the last time Neville saw his wife and child as they were evacuated from the quarantined city find clever ways to sustain what is for more than half the movie a one-man (plus dog and zombies) show. It helps of course that Smith is that one man; there are few movie stars who can hold the screen with such effortless charisma. When you have to deliver most of your lines to a dog thats no mean feat. He throws himself into this physically demanding role with great conviction.The trouble is those damn white-skinned vampire zombies who bring the movie down to cheap-horror-movie level. I wont say theyre not scary especially when we first see them but when they start clambering up the sides of buildings with implausible superhuman agility they begin to look exactly like what they are herky-jerky computerized effects. Lawrence as he showed in the flashy but out of control ""Constantine"" can stage knock-your-socks-off set pieces but hes willing to settle for cheap thrills at the expense of coherence. That exciting opening with Neville tearing through Manhattan is a case in point. The only reason for him to be driving so recklessly is to kick-start the movie with an adrenaline rush.""I Am Legend"" cant seem to make up its mind just what kind of movie it wants to be. Its visionary depiction of a postplague world where a solitary man tries to hold on to his sanity gives way to an intense but quite conventional night-of-the-living-dead remix and then in its third act when Neville finally makes contact with other human beings (a young Brazilian nurse played by Alice Braga with young boy in tow) introduces the notion of the Almighty--a curious spiritual turn that comes from God knows where. I wouldnt dream of giving away the ending but its not likely to satisfy either the action crowd or Matheson fans. More than a few times Lawrences movie evoked memories of last years ""Children of Men"" another dystopian vision of our imperiled planet. The comparison does not work in ""I Am Legends"" favor.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

"Review I Am Legend a taut thriller - CNN.com Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon Review I Am Legend a taut thrillerStory Highlights Three years after a medical breakthrough something is wrong in New York Will Smith is cool and unflappable as he takes on flesh-eating mutants Version of Richard Mathesons sci-fi novel flags at the end but mostly good Next Article in Entertainment >> By Tom Charity Special to CNN (CNN) -- If anyones going to be the last man on Earth then Will Smith seems like an ideal candidate. Will Smith plays the survivor of a plague in ""I Am Legend."" Cool and athletic focused and unflappable hes not someone whos going to give up on humanity just because the odds are stacked against him. Even at several billion to one hes still adamant he can fix this thing. A third movie version of Richard Mathesons classic sci-fi novel ""I Am Legend"" has been on the table at Warner Bros. for a long time. In the 90s Arnold Schwarzenegger talked about following in the footsteps of Vincent Price and Charlton Heston (remember ""The Omega Man""?). Smith is such a different type its odd to think that hes taken over this mantle. In fact hes scored consistently well in sci-fi from ""Independence Day"" through ""Men in Black"" and ""I Robot"" and theres no reason to suppose the tense scary ""I Am Legend"" wont continue that impressive box office run even if the movie itself flags on the last lap. The opening couldnt be sharper. A television news report hails a medical breakthrough -- a viral cure for cancer no less. Cut to New York three years later abandoned cars no one in sight grass growing waist-high around Times Square. Something has gone very very wrong. Smith is Robert Neville. The cover of Time on his fridge door pictures a ""Soldier. Scientist. Savior?"" but that hanging question mark is well chosen and we divine that his immunity is pure chance. Hes not quite alone. Neville patrols Fifth Avenue in his Mustang with Sam a German Shepherd (also immune to the airborne virus) broadcasting into the void then returning home to his Washington Square townhouse to put up the shutters before nightfall. Thats when the ""Dark Seekers"" venture out feral contaminated people with a rabid appetite for flesh but no pupil dilation reflex to protect them against sunlight. By now anyone who caught ""28 Days Later"" or last years sequel ""28 Weeks Later"" may be experiencing deja vu -- in fact if they called this movie ""2.8 Years Later"" it could pass as the third installment in the series with very little tweaking. Which is not to downplay the special frisson of seeing the Brooklyn Bridge ripped across the middle for example. Wisely dispensing with the Luddite rhetoric that bogged down ""The Omega Man"" ""I Am Legend"" doesnt have much time for Neville the soldier. While Chuck Heston dedicated himself to exterminating the albino hordes Will Smith starts out firmly on the other end of the kill-or-cure scale. At the same time the film suggests his self-sufficient scientific rationalism is not enough. By day 1001 hes on the point of suicide -- which is when the movie gets God in the comely intervention of born-again Alice Braga. If the last half-hour feels thrown together ""Constantine"" director Francis Lawrence mostly makes a virtue of the lean script getting in and out quick suppressing those inevitable nagging questions (are cockroaches immune?) always stressing Nevilles solitary isolation. So often sci-fi is overproduced but ""I Am Legend"" doesnt look like a CGI extravaganza. It looks like an edgy suspense movie shot on the fly in New York City after the fall. And because of that its all the more effective. ""I Am Legend"" is rated PG-13 and runs 100 minutes. For Entertainment Weeklys take click here.

After all it worked with I Robot and Men in Black. The first half of Constantine director Francis Lawrences re-imagining suggests that the darker themes of Richard Mathesons 1954 novel might survive. Then the redundant flashbacks kick in the mutant albino monsters appear and youre left gawping at 100 million-worth of eye-popping futuristic B-movie.Kudos to Smith for taking on the Charlton Heston role of Richard Neville a military virologist who miraculously survives a pandemic that wiped out most of Manhattans citizens and transformed the rest into flesh-craving nocturnal zombies. But he is such a likeable actor that he fails to take us with him when he changes from a kooky Bob Marley-loving guy who talks to his dog into an embittered faithless cynic. And God knows he has reason to doubt his wife and daughter were killed during the evacuation and he spends his days scavenging for supplies and searching for an antidote. His nights are spent barricaded inside a brownstone while the creatures of the night howl for blood outside.Despite the striking post-apocalyptic images of nature returning to the city this is an oddly benign world. Like the herd of deer that Neville encounters Lawrences vision is timid and evasive. The film falls apart when the appearance of Anna (Alice Braga) restores Nevilles faith and lays the groundwork for an absurd religious happy ending.

I hate reading but i loved the book. you will find that even though the film is taken from the book they are two completely different thing. The book does contain good action however it is actually about how a person deals with isolation and dealing with it mentally and sexually. The book focuses more on the feelings and thoughts and actions of isolation and how it can turn you to suicide. But in the book Robert Neville eventually loses to the vampires and kills himself before e is executed by the new vampire race who are able to walk around in day light. The title "" I AM LEGEND"" is known because to the vampires he is the ""day walker"" the human version of dracula. Dracula would go into peoples rooms when they were sleeping. Robert Neville would do the same when they were sleeping during the day.As you know Dracula is the vampire legend in the human world. So Robert Nevlle is the human legend in the vampire world. Will Smith done a extremely good job of potraying the protagonist but the book is a bit depressing with acions scenes flung in. But after all it is hollywood and they wouldnt do that. In my opinion read the book then see the film or see the fil then read the book. if u do this u will appreciate the film more. even if u hate reading like me u wll enjoy the book. it isnt a long book so it shouldnt take u long.

Thats not good since youre a social animal and you can hardly hang out with the hordes of murderous zombies who emerge from their tenebrous hives every night. On the other hand youve got the city to yourself in the daytime -- no gridlock no pickpockets no bicycle messengers to dodge. Such is the plight of Will Smith in ""I Am Legend"" just as it was essentially the situation that confronted Charlton Heston and Vincent Price in earlier thrillers adapted from the same sci-fi novel by Richard Matheson. But the plight of the audience is this. The star as solo practitioner does a terrific job of holding our attention when were not taking in surreal vistas of a deserted Manhattan that are fascinating in their own right. Still zombies are zombies and this nasty lot mostly digital creations of variable quality keep draining the distinction that the movie seeks and occasionally finds. The cause of humanitys downfall was we are told a virus created by genetic tinkering in the course of cancer research. (In the Price film the 1964 ""The Last Man on Earth"" it was plain old plague while Mr. Hestons 1971 vehicle ""The Omega Man"" blamed it on a world-wide biological war. Times change and movies scramble to keep up with them.) Will Smiths character a military virologist named Robert Neville has an immunity to the lethal virus which has left the worlds few survivors zombified and for much of the movie Mr. Smith himself seems immune to the formula encroachments of the horror genre. He certainly makes the most of what the basic plot device gives him a dog to talk to and to succor (far better an empathic pooch than Tom Hankss volleyball in ""Cast Away""); exercise equipment to work out on (the actor is in impressive shape) an assault rifle to shoot with (the targets of choice being wild deer and wilder zombies) the city as a theme park to explore at ones peril after the crowds have left. (In one of the most memorable vignettes Neville drives golf balls onto city streets while standing atop one wing of the Blackbird spy plane thats parked on the towering flight deck of the aircraft carrier-become-museum Intrepid.) ENLARGE ""I Am Legend"" which was directed by Francis Lawrence is more than a plot device. The story begins on a note of hope and ends with a surprise. When the film flashes back to New Yorks last days and hours as a populated city Andrew Lesnies camera finds awful grandeur in the rising chaos. (The production designer was Naomi Shohan.) Neville believes plausibly enough that he can find a cure for the worlds viral ill. As solitude and desperation take their toll on him though he takes on the demeanor of an archetypal mad scientist and the film becomes a showcase for its stars dramatic gifts. (Mr. Smith also gets to do a charming imitation of Bob Marley -- the movie desperately needs his sense of fun -- in an eloquent scene about Marley as an artist with a virologists approach to using art.) But the herky-jerky script by Mark Protosevich and Akiva Goldsman favors vignettes and set pieces over dramatic development and those damned zombies are everywhere overwhelming the proceedings with their slobbering and howling. Its the end of civilization as seen by Edvard Munch. The Kite Runner When filmmakers decide to adapt a widely admired book they assume a heavy debt load. Marc Forster and David Benioff the director and script writer of ""The Kite Runner"" have discharged their debt dutifully but without daring or passion. The film set mainly in Afghanistan makes a workmanlike stab at evoking that nations recent turbulent history -- from the last peaceful days of the monarchy through the Soviet invasion to the Talibans malefic reign. (The Afghan sequences were actually shot in China.) And the boys at the core of Khaled Hosseinis first novel wealthy Amir and his friend Hassan the son of a servant in Amirs house are touching at the outset playing together heedlessly and flying their fighter kites. Yet their story of childhood devotion and betrayal never catches fire for theyre played by non-professional youngsters who act as if theyd been directed to concentrate on one emotional state at a time -- happiness willfulness devotion submissiveness -- and had done their work all too earnestly. ENLARGE Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada and Zekeria Ebrahimi in The Kite Runner In a movie about a storyteller (Amir as an adult in America is played by Khalid Abdalla) the storytelling pace moves between deliberate and sluggish. Even the crucial scene an instant of betrayal that leads to the heros decades-long quest for expiation and redemption proves perfunctory though its tasteful enough if thats what you want from a depiction of ghastly predation. The only reliable source of energy is Homayoun Ershadi a powerful actor who plays Baba Amirs Westernized father. Indeed Baba provides the films first moment of genuine drama when he decides to defend a woman he doesnt know from a Soviet soldier who may well kill him. By that time though almost an hour has drifted by. Youth Without Youth Youth Without Youth"" Francis Ford Coppolas first film in a decade starts with a literal coup de foudre -- a lightning bolt that strikes the hero an aging professor of linguistics named Dominic Matei and rejuvenates him after nearly killing him. Dominic who is played by Tim Roth finds himself beset by an anguishing paradox. Hes now a young man with old memories and unquenchable longings -- to find his lost love Laura to finish the book that constitutes his lifes work. What passes for a plot has the professor pursued by Nazis; his apparent immortality has intrigued Hitlers eugenicists. But the essence of ""Youth Without Youth"" which was shot -- luminously -- in Romania lies in its solemn speculations about aging time and consciousness. Mr. Coppola is one of the cinemas peerless masters and I would have enjoyed nothing more than a chance to celebrate his new film. Im truly sorry to say then that I found it impenetrable. DVD TIP The sine qua non of zombiedom remains ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968) the low-budget horror flick that George A. Romero unleashed on an unsuspecting world almost four decades ago. Radiation from outer space is the reason given for a sudden wave of zombie attacks but the main reason for the films enduring popularity is its claustrophobic intensity -- two groups of people board themselves up in a small farmhouse to defend themselves against the slavering flesh-eaters.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Sports Authority plans to pay top executives 2.85 million in bankruptcy bonuses Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie ""I Am Legend"" poses a problem of pop-culture math Can a B movie plus a B movie ever equal an A flick? Will Smith does everything to answer that in the affirmative. His effort is valiant as valiant as that of his character Robert Neville in trying to find a cure for a man-engineered virus once heralded as a cure for cancer.  RATING | Apocalypse Soon In three years the virus wiped out billions 12 million survived. They like Neville were immune to the virus which resembles rabies and the rage virus in the emotionally superior ""28 Days Later."" But then those survivors were killed by those who were infected. The original source material for this film Richard Mathesons 1954 novel about the sole survivor of a viral pandemic who becomes the persistent focus of vampires is a well-crafted study of a character under existential duress. Yet something is missing in this interpretation. And we dont just mean the entirety of Earths population. What should be shattering is often merely intriguing. Once the last great hope of humankind Neville now roams the streets of New York during the day. His only companions are a retrofitted rifle and Sam a glorious German shepherd who got his close-up in Entertainment Weekly. Wowing us early with a desolate New York City director Francis Lawrence and cinematographer Andrew Lesnie follow the last man and last mans best friend as they race through Manhattan streets in a candy-red racing-striped Mustang of recent vintage although the year is 2012. Three years earlier the worldwide catastrophe struck and military virologist Neville put his wife (Salli Richardson) and child (Smiths daughter Willow) on a helicopter out of New York before the bridges were destroyed for quarantine. Now a herd of deer romps and grazes on the avenues leaping over abandoned cars and diving through shoulder-high overgrowth. The special effects have them move too fast to feel quite true. But the filmmakers tempered use of music allows other sounds to infuse the city with a melancholy naturalism. Birdsong insect whines and after the sun wanes more guttural noises provide much of the films soundtrack. Its an eerie spectacle. When Neville and Sams chase after the deer is trumped by an escapee from the Central Park Zoo the movie asserts an ""Animal Planet"" edge. Neville is not the only one in search of prey. He continues to work on a serum in his basement laboratory in hopes of returning the creatures he captures for his vampire trials to human form. Mathesons novel has been given the close-up treatment twice once in 1964 as ""The Last Man on Earth"" starring Vincent Price; then in 1971 when Charlton Heston stepped into Nevilles sorry boots as the titular Omega Man. Holed up in vacant Los Angeles he was the collaterally damaged survivor of germ warfare between Russia and China. Smith represents a radical ratcheting up of star power. And he is is utterly watchable -- a good thing. Hes in nearly every scene talking to himself or Sam yammering at store mannequins singing along to Bob Marley the movies patron saint. Each day he promises on an AM frequency to be at South Street Seaport. Hes there. Just in case. As with last years ""Pursuit of Happyness"" Smith acts his belief in the meaningful pleasures of mass entertainment. His performance embodies loss and hope vigilant awareness and the creeping madness of a wide-open version of solitary confinement. ""I Am Legend"" was adapted by Mark Protosevich and Akiva Goldsman from ""The Omega Man"" screenplay (written by John William amp; Joyce H. Corrington). Protosevich most recently penned ""Poseidon"" the sinker remake of the Shelley Winters classic. Goldsman won an Oscar for the psychologically rich ""A Beautiful Mind."" The tension shows. Grief is entirely too muted here. And while this may be good for the films PG-13 rating it makes ""I Am Legend"" a muted undertaking with a suspect resolution.

Will Smith stars as Robert Neville the lone person unaffected by a mutation-causing plague in the sci-fi thriller I Am Legend. Photo AP I Am Legend 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Ive lost count but I Am Legend is roughly the zillionth horror film to feature bloodsucking mutants -- vampires zombies zampires what have you -- and the bajillionth sci-fi morality tale set in a grimy apocalyptic landscape. The film might look like a latecomer but it is in fact loosely based on the grandpappy of vampiric-disease-survivor fiction Richard Mathesons 1954 novel of the same name. In it a lone man immune to a rogue germ that decimated humanity copes with tedium and fights off a population of transformed cannibalistic ghouls. Mathesons book has been reworked a few times before most famously in 1971s literally defanged thoroughly Charlton Hestonized The Omega Man. But even this smart new 21st-century update -- from Constantine director Francis Lawrence and screenwriters Mark Protosevich and Akiva Goldsman -- has the feel of old-fangled loner heroism weighty and proud. Man in basement struggles to restore the human race. The man in this go-round is Will Smith -- the anti-Heston. As Dr. Robert Neville he wears both his chesty heroism and his suffering lightly even in tearful flashbacks to his separation from wife and child. During I Am Legends terrific first hour he and his faithful canine sidekick roam the weedy streets of a New York City now emptied of people but rioting with crickets mourning doves thundering herds of deer a family of lions and -- after the sun sets -- vampires. They are the movies sticking point and Im not referring to their teeth. Not much is seen of these bloodthirsty creatures in the films first half which dwells on the humdrum details and accumulated sadness of Nevilles daily routine. He wakes he chats with mannequins he dons a white lab coat and works on a serum to cure the plague. At midday he tees off from an aircraft carrier and scans for other survivors. Sometimes he hunts. At night he seals up his home and huddles in the bathtub with his dog Sam as bloodsuckers enter the night howling. Neville has a few genuinely freaky encounters with these pasty-faced post-humans including a long-faced big-armed wide-mouthed alpha male played by Dash Mihok -- whom you wont recognize from an episode of Cavemen. But then three things happen. The vampires appear in droves. They cease to be terrifying. And the film loses its grip on the audience. The ""dark seekers"" when they arrive en masse look too much like video-game combatants; theyre computerized out the wazoo wherever that might be on their heavily muscled CG anatomy. They are no longer recognizable as flesh-and-blood men and women and they are no longer frightening as a result. I had high hopes for them too. When Lawrence first showed his protagonist watching perky old tapes of the Today show I half-expected to see Matt and Meredith a few scenes later looking anemic and sucking down deer blood. Now that would have been scary. I Am Legend leaves a few other avenues unexplored a few of Mathesons darker realms untouched and a few gaping plot holes unfilled. In the end it does nothing too original with its (by-now) hoary premise. But Lawrences direction is patient solid and suspenseful and his vision of a lone fellow wandering through the atavistic hulk of Manhattan yields an indelible portrait of post-cataclysmic solitude. I Am Legend is best when its exploring New York along with Nevilles humanity -- where those bloodsucking mutants are nowhere to be found. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals KitchenAid Small Kitchen Appliances at eBay Up to 51% off +...

BY Jack Mathews Tuesday June 3 2008 338 PM I Am Legend. Sci-fi thriller about a scientist living among zombies in an abandoned Manhattan in 2012. With Will Smith Alice Braga. Director Francis Lawrence (140). PG-13 Violence. At area theaters.The Manhattan movie of the year Francis Lawrences ""I Am Legend"" offers a stunning glimpse into how the city - as we know it today - might look in 2012 if it were abandoned in 2009.This is the third adaptation of Richard Mathesons 1954 novel one of those sci-fi horror stories inspired by our fears of outer space and the strange diseases and plagues it might rain down on us. Specifically it tells the story of a scientist who because of his immunity is the only New Yorker to survive a virus that turns humans into flesh-eating zombies. Vincent Price first played the role in 1964s ""The Last Man on Earth"" and Charlton Heston took it on in 1971s ""The Omega Man."" Will Smith does the honors in the new improved version demonstrating his charismatic presence in a film that rests almost solely on his shoulders. The only other humans we see other than his family in flashbacks of the evacuation are a mother (Alice Braga) and her son (Charlie Tahan) whove driven up from Maryland with god as their co-pilot. Mom and boy arrive late and serve only as a sop to the End Times evangelical audience. In fact as terrific as Smith is in the role of Dr. Robert Neville the art director and set dressers are the behind-the-scenes stars of this movie. With familiar chunks of Manhattan blocked off during weekend mornings over a period of months those cinematic miracle workers turned Times Square Fifth Ave. Tribeca the Meatpacking District and docks on the East and West Sides of the city into canyons of foul decay a landscape overrun with weeds and rust and roaming descendants of Central Park Zoo denizens. In this environment Neville - accompanied by his savvy German shepherd Sam - splits his time hunting elk on the streets during the day researching a cure for the anti-cancer virus that mutated into the killer and insulating himself against attacks from the monsters prowling the night. Smith has a tough task making himself interesting while relating only to his dog and to mannequins that his lonely paranoid mind takes for real friends. But he and those street magicians who dressed Manhattan pull it off. jmathewsnydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

The island is overrun by hordes of frighteningly malformed brain-damaged mouth-breathers (though unlike todays crowds they are not carrying maps and asking directions to Applebees). On the plus side of 2012 According to ""I Am Legend"" it will then be OK to shoot these people with high-powered rifles. Will Smith stars as the Last Man on Earth in a scary inventive exciting and breathless adventure that combines the best elements of ""Children of Men"" ""Escape from New York"" and ""The Road Warrior"" but leaves out the worst stuff - such as the story-clogging despair and political allegory in ""Children"" a movie that made apocalypse look like kind of a downer. ""I Am Legend"" is also a re-remake of 1964s Vincent Price film ""The Last Man on Earth"" and ""The Omega Man"" the 1971 Charlton Heston flick shot in an LA empty of all intelligent life. (Just crack your own joke here.) In a prologue we learn that in 2009 there will be a cure for cancer. One or two unintended consequences later a virus as noxious as the Knicks front office hangs in the air while everyone in Manhattan desperately tries to flee. Soldiers stop people at checkpoints in a nightmarish vision of hell that if you added about 12000 spaghetti straps and some 350 bottles of vodka would closely resemble the Meatpacking District on a Friday night. After all of this Smiths Lt. Col. Neville an expert in viruses weaponry and survival skills who has also found time to memorize large portions of ""Shrek"" is alone in the city immune to the retrovirus. Every day he leaves his Washington Square digs (decorated in a sort of House and Fortress scheme that involves retractable barricades and van Goghs liberated from museums) to forage for supplies with his German shepherd Sam racing his Mustang around spectacular vistas of a New York overgrown by weeds and ravaged by flooding. Herds of wildlife run free and tanks and cars are jammed together in phalanxes of steel. At night Neville must take cover Thats when the zombies or ""Night Seekers"" come out to moan more loudly than striking screenwriters - and theyre hungry for more than just residuals. In other words Nevilles life though lonely is also kind of fun. Who wouldnt enjoy limitless time to bathe his dog watch every DVD in the video store and hit golf balls off an aircraft carrier in the Hudson River as though acting out the apocalypse according to Kramer? I personally could use six to nine months of post-human void just to catch up on old copies of The New Yorker and contemplate eternal mysteries of human existence such as why everyone thought ""Babel"" was so great. Cmon how can you beat deer hunting on Central Park South from the window of a speeding Mustang especially when youve got an assault rifle and every PETA activist has long since been devoured by carnivores? This movie is going to be bigger than crucifix sales on Judgment Day and the main lesson Hollywood should learn from it is that if youre going to show the end of the world try to look on the bright side. Neville isnt just wandering around playing kill-or-be-killed with the zombies or worse stomping on the allegory pedal so well be sure to walk away thinking someone like Dick Cheney was behind all this. Neville is trying to develop an antidote to the virus one that could re verse the effects of the disease and turn these ag gressively hos tile semi- human shriek ers into de cent human beings or at least some thing that screams no more than the average celebrity publicist. He needs to get out and interact with the zombies (and even zombie rats) injecting them with compounds derived from his own immune blood. Which certainly ensures he gets plenty of exercise The zombies are clever enough to imitate his own methods for capturing them and if he lingers outdoors for one second past dusk theyll be on him like telemarketers at dinner time. The allegory that does come into play meanwhile is so unexpected for this era that its refreshing (although 50 years ago the same idea would have been cliche). ""I Am Legend"" says that when it comes to seeking scientific solutions for the worlds self-inflicted miseries it wouldnt hurt to ask God for a clue. kyle.smithnypost.com I AM LEGENDGood Will hunting.Running time 100 minutes.

Picture Review I human - Will Smith plays last man standing in I Am Legend 1 / 2 Back to Gallery I Am Legend Science fiction. Starring Will Smith Salli Richardson Alice Braga Charlie Tahan and Willow Smith. Directed by Francis Lawrence. (PG-13. 114 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""I Am Legend"" the third major film made from Richard Mathesons 1954 sci-fi novel gives us lots of Will Smith and lots of industrial-strength special effects and if thats what you want the movie delivers. Smith does battle against virus-crazed ex-human monsters in a post-apocalyptic New York City rendered with all the loving detail that todays CGI can muster. Smith of course has a track record of popular filmic battles against horrible (and comic) menaces to mankind (""Independence Day"" ""Men in Black""). This time he plays Robert Neville a military scientist who is as far as he knows the last living human. He hides out in a brownstone in Manhattan (nice digs on Washington Square) the ground zero of a man-made disease thats ravaged the planet. Aside from his dog and various wild beasts the only other beings on the island are hairless bloodthirsty infected mutants who emerge at night (like vampires theyre allergic to sunlight) to try to kill Neville whos immune to the virus. In his basement lab he struggles to find a cure by conducting experiments on mutants hes trapped like animals. Otherwise Neville spends his time talking to Sam (his dog) knocking golf balls from an abandoned battleship hunting for meat with a high-powered rifle sending is-there-anybody-out-there messages and doing a few things that recall his old life like visiting the video store. In his best moments Neville is good old Will Smith (his appealing traits include a love for Bob Marley and we hear snippets of Marley songs) but hes slowly going crazy. In flashbacks we see the origins of the virus and Nevilles desperate attempt to get his wife (Salli Richardson) and daughter (Willow Smith Wills real-life child) out of the city before its quarantined. The film offers great images of New York in ruins - grass growing in the streets cornfields in Central Park and lots of surprises that I wont spoil - which must have consumed a good part of its reported 150 million budget. The mutants arrival onscreen ought to be the big payoff but they are curiously unsatisfying mostly CGI images that look like they came from the standard movie and video game monster factory - basic uglies that howl incessantly and move with ungodly speed and agility. Eventually Neville encounters a pair of healthy humans (Alice Braga Charlie Tahan) brought in mainly to set up the films ending and to demonstrate by contrast just how dingy Neville has become. The conclusion is a big problem. The previous adaptations - the engagingly crummy ""Last Man on Earth"" (1964) starring Vincent Price and the painfully dated ""Omega Man"" (1971) featuring Charlton Heston - also ended differently from the novel (and each other). But this latest wrap-up is an out-of-the-blue affair unconvincingly optimistic and perhaps the least satisfying of the three which has to be laid at the feet of screenwriters Mark Protosevich and Akiva Goldsman. The director Francis Lawrence has made music videos (Britney J-Lo Green Day) and in 2005 a Keanu Reeves supernatural thriller ""Constantine."" Lawrence is pretty good at the spectacular stuff like the big nighttime evacuation scene which is the kind of set piece these movies exist for. And hes smart enough to let Smith be Smith. But theres only so much you can do with CGI monsters that dont seem right for this kind of sci-fi scenario. Maybe they threw too much money at this one. In the 64 version Price drives around town in a station wagon to perform various odd and sometimes gruesome tasks and the movie quietly manages to make this a parody of a typical suburban shopping trip. You can actually do a lot with a 2.98 budget. -- Advisory Rated R for language.

Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME Correction appended on January 2 2008. Will Smith used to be able to crack a smile and to crack up the audience with a joke a silly song or his elastic eloquent body English. Lately though the most reliable box-office magnet in Hollywood hasnt given himself or his fans much to laugh at. He was a tough emotionally constipated cop chasing androids in I Robot and an ambitious man who loses his job his home and his wife -- everything but his young son -- in The Pursuit of Happyness. Except for a romantic holiday in Hitch the one-time Fresh Prince has become a stolid solitary warrior in a gulag of gloom. Now for Christmas he has another one-man dystopia drama. Its I Am Legend directed by Francis Lawrence the Viennese director of music videos who made his feature debut with a good science-fiction film Constantine and written by Akiva Goldsman based on Mark Protosevichs script for a 1999 I Am Legend project that was to be directed by Ridley Scott and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. As in I Robot Smith has seen the future -- and it sucks. September 2012 three years after the onset of a virus with catastrophic consequences. Weeds have sprouted and flourished in Times Square. Tattered billboards for Broadway shows mock the desolation of the place which is now ugly cratered and overrun by wildlife -- kind of what it was like in the 1970s. Except that now Times Square is empty of all human life except for Robert Neville (Smith) who patrols the streets with his rifle and his faithful dog Samantha. He spots a deer and is ready to gun it down when a lioness leaps on her prey and begins devouring it as her mate and cub watch. As we used to say about New York 30 years ago its a jungle out there. I Am Legend is the third major movie adaptation of the 1954 novel by Richard Matheson; the others were the The Last Man on Earth with Vincent Price in 1964 and The Omega Man with Charlton Heston seven years later. Matheson is a prolific influential writer of horror and sci-fi novels short stories and films from Roger Cormans Edgar Allan Poe movies of the 60s to the seminal 70s TV films Duel (Steven Spielbergs first feature) and The Night Stalker and the 90s films What Dreams May Come and Stir of Echoes based on his novels. Some of Mathesons TV fables -- the Twilight Zone story about the gremlin on the airplane wing the Trilogy of Terror jape about a Zuni fetish doll chasing Karen Black around her apartment -- linger at the base of many a viewers spine three or four decades after they were first aired. Credit those residual shivers to a nonchalant nonpareil master of the creep-out. Early in his career (hes still going at age 81) Matheson was fascinated with mans isolation in the post-nuclear world -- Robinson Crusoe or Natty Bumppo after the H-bomb or an epidemic. The Shrinking Man published in 1956 and immediately filmed as The Incredible Shrinking Man considered the effects of radiation on an ordinary fellow who grows smaller and smaller to infinitesimal size. In I Am Legend Neville seemingly the only person not killed or infected by a plague fends for himself searches desperately for other survivors and hunts down the bands of infected mutants who come out at night looking for people like him -- if there are any people like him left. Both novels take a science-fiction premise and ask What practical skills what inner resources can a man bring to battling life-ending odds? The Shrinking Man and I Am Legend are how-to books about coping with the unthinkable. Its funny how filmmakers are drawn to Mathesons subject of post-apocalyptic annihilation yet feel the need to ""fix"" the story and welsh out on its conclusions. Each of the I Am Legend adaptations embroiders or softens the original offering a vision its makers see as more pertinent to their time. Not that theres anything morally pernicious about changing a book when it becomes a movie. The only question that matters Does the new thing work? For this I Am Legend a qualified maybe. The word ""mixed"" isnt mixed enough to fit my response to this film. I like its fancifully ghostly ghastly look the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges missing their center sections (they were bombed to keep people from getting out or in) the whole idea of the most congested U.S. city utterly abandoned as if everyone had finally moved to the Sunbelt or the Hamptons. I admire and share the movies extended interest in Nevilles daily ritual as cop (hunting down the vampire-like infectees) woodsman (looking for animals that will put fresh meat on his table) and lonely guy (setting up a table each day at noon in case any undead survivor has heard his signal). Smith whatever mood hes inhabiting is a watchable actor and he and the dog (who gives him an audience surrogate to explain things to) have a lovely close rapport. I go for the scary scenes too. The lions arent the big problem here; its the mutants whom exposure to the virus has made gaunt pretrenaturally athletic (they can climb tall buildings at several bounds) and as ravenous as any killer carnivore for human flesh. One sequence in which Neville follows the dog into a dark building and is confronted by the creatures worked on my nerves with a superior technical and artistic skill set -- a mixture of computer beasties and old-fashioned suspense. The new movie has turned Neville into a soldier-scientist (and former TIME cover boy) seeking a cure for the virus in the basement of the lavish Washington Square townhouse he has turned into a fortress (and where dont ask me why he sleeps in the bathtub with his dog). So now hes Jonas Salk and Jesus too ready to give his life so that others may live again. Its in the last half-hour that I Am Legend imports new elements that both propel the story to its explosive climax and just arent as compelling as the day-in-the-life story that preceded it. The notion the movie floats of an uninfected colony north of the city is literally too Utopian to seem either plausible or attractive to a hardened case like Neville. Smith has inhabited the character so fully and let moviegoers inside with him that they may prefer going down with him than escaping to some fantasyland that looks like the one in M. Night Shyamalans The Village. And even if the world is saved in September 2012 dont these people know the deductions made from the Mayan calendar -- that the world will end on Dec. 21 of that year? They have only three months to live Somebody in Hollywood has to be thinking about a movie on that subject. Heres hoping it will have a smarter ending -- and be more legendary -- than this one.

A gifted physical actor with charisma to burn hes one of the very few actors who can star essentially solo in a feature-length film and keep us riveted. CLIP See the Legend drama unfold MORE How does Legend stack up against other last-man flicks? So on the strength of his performance and an intriguing apocalyptic story the first half of I Am Legend is fascinating and fun to watch. But a little more than halfway in Legend based on the book by Richard Matheson (which also spawned 1971s Omega Man and 1964s TheLast Man on Earth) deteriorates into a schlocky zombie horror flick and loses its steam. Smith plays Robert Neville a scientist still working to reverse the incurable man-made virus that wiped out the population. Because he is immune to the virus he becomes the last man standing in New York. Seeing such a vibrant city become a ghost town is almost worth the price of admission. After the outbreak Neville is left with only the company of his beloved German shepherd and sad memories of his wife and child. But even in this seemingly deserted metropolis hes not truly alone. Undead mutant creatures are lurking nearby. Though he outwits them for a while they eventually come to torment Neville and try to devour him. But because of the been-there done-that quality of zombie movies and the poor quality of the computer-generated imagery his faceoffs with them are not scary or suspenseful. The rampaging zombies dont look at all convincing. Instead they look like escapees from a second-rate video game. Smiths physical transformation is awe-inspiring. He got in peak shape and lost 20 pounds for the role. And in the midst of the grim reality of his isolation he makes desperate efforts to tap into his humanity. His strong comic sense is well used here. The close relationship with his dog is altogether believable and touching. Smith is one of the few actors who can seem personable while muttering to himself or talking to his dog. But his powerful performance is not enough to save the movie -- initially a potent meditation on loneliness and an absorbing doomsday action movie -- from taking a wrong turn and never getting back on track.

At major theatres. 14A""Nothing worked the way it was supposed to work"" Will Smith rages from his solitary hell in I Am Legend yet this remarkable sci-fi thriller works a lot better than anyone could have expected.Long considered a lost cause owing to its neglected-child status in Hollywood where rising costs and personnel changes kept it on Warner Bros. back burner for years this third major adaptation of novelist Richard Mathesons 1954 future shocker scores in almost every department.The genial Smith was far from the obvious choice to play muscular egghead Robert Neville the military virologist whose immunity to a lethal global virus has left him marooned amidst a New York filled with vampire zombies. The original candidate was Arnold Schwarzenegger who decamped to become the Governator of California. Smith pumps iron and put his poker face on for the demanding role which requires him to be onscreen solo for most of the picture talking either to himself his dog or the shop mannequins that are his hallucinatory pals.Article Continued BelowHe does so with conviction exceeding the drama he brought to last years Oscar-nominated role as a downtrodden dad in The Pursuit of Happyness. Yet Smiths good humour isnt entirely lost as witnessed in Nevilles ironic choice of motivational music Bob Marleys hopeful refrain about how ""everythings gonna be all right."" Smith also exhibits marvellous rapport in exchanges with Nevilles canine companion Sam a brainy German shepherd that frequently steals the show.Smiths performance bears comparison to Charlton Hestons streetwise warrior in The Omega Man the 1971 cult film that I Am Legend director Francis Lawrence (Constantine) and producer/co-writer Akiva Goldsman (writing with Mark Protosevich) credit as their major inspiration along with Mathesons original story. (Less obvious is any ties to 1964 original movie The Last Man on Earth which starred Vincent Price as the cheesiest of zombie slayers.)The biggest change to the original concept is the shift from the relative sprawl of Los Angeles to the island of New York a move that capitalizes on the tales essential claustrophobia and paranoia. Its far easier to fear the undead lurking in the nooks and crannies of an abandoned Manhattan a place made all the eerier by the first-rate CGI horror show. Denuded of humanity by a cancer cure that morphed into a killer virus the city is a no-go zone of bombed-out bridges and streets overgrown with vegetation and free-foraging wild life.Flashbacks with an uncredited Emma Thompson as a misguided cancer cure hero and Smiths daughter Willow as his daughter Marley establish the grim back-story without delaying the action.The vision of the walking undead is also an improvement over previous tellings of the tale even if the ravenous zombies - who walk only at night - do bear a distracting resemblance to a certain faceless Harry Potter villain. Most chilling is the lead zombie played by Dash Mihok who utters not a word yet howls like the darkest of nightmares.I Am Legend works so well for its first two acts its disappointing when the third yields to typical thriller conventions replete with implausible coincidences and dubious science.The fact that it succeeds at all is largely due to a stellar performance by Smith who in an alternative universe would be a serious candidate for a dramatic actor prize.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor December 14 2007 Save for later Saved What would you do if you were the last human survivor of an unstoppable man-made virus in New York City? Star in your own one-person Broadway show? Smoke in restaurants? Walk blindfolded through Central Park at midnight?If youre Will Smiths Robert Neville a miraculously immune military virologist who was researching a cure when panic broke out the choices are grimmer. He speeds down Fifth Avenue in his Ford Mustang while taking aim at wild deer with his high-powered rifle. He saunters into video stores and has pretend conversations with the nonexistent help. Most important he tries to find a cure for the virus.""I Am Legend"" is based on the famous Richard Matheson novel that has twice before been adapted for the screen the 1964 Vincent Price film ""The Last Man on Earth"" and 1971s ""The Omega Man"" with Charlton Heston. Mathesons core idea is so powerful that it consistently canceled out the clunkiness of those adaptations. The new one is no exception. You may want to laugh at it but the laughter catches in your throat because the films centerpiece - a humanless New York City - is so magisterially eerie. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Neville has only his German shepherd Sam for company during the day at least. At night the virally mutated zombies come out to play. For my taste they show up too early and when they do ""I Am Legend"" turns into a megabudget version of ""Night of the Living Dead."" Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 We dont get enough of how Neville copes with his crushing loneliness or what it would be like to truly inhabit a humanless city and thats a double loss since Smith seems up to the task. Hes such a physically adroit actor that he can go for long stretches without dialogue and yet always key us into his thoughts. Director Francis Lawrence and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman had a chance to give this material a decidedly psychological spin but they opted for something more conventional and action-oriented. Films like ""28 Days Later"" for a fraction of this films budget already beat them to the punch.Neville is all too obviously intended as an Everyman. His desire to reach out and touch someone - anyone - is freighted with apocalyptic meaning. He represents mankinds inherent desire for connection in a world that has lost its (fill in the blank). Since the killer virus came about as the result of a botched cancer cure were meant to think that man should not play God. Except in a way thats just what Neville is doing.Smith it should be noted has compared Neville in interviews to Job. Tone down the highfalutin references. In the end this is a sci-fi zombie movie folks.

Deer run the avenues hopscotching around abandoned cars. Mass graves fill Central Park. Manhattan in the year 2012 is a ghost town. Not even Rudy Giuliani could save the place. But maybe Will Smith can. In I Am Legend a big-budget adaptation of Richard Mathesons 1954 sci-fi novel (and two film versions the 1964 Last Man on Earth and the 1971 Charlton Heston-starring Omega Man) Smith plays Robert Neville a military scientist who seems to be the last man in Manhattan. Each day Neville will wake up do his pull-ups feed himself and his dog and then take his gun and go a-huntin - tooling around the empty streets in a red Mustang. Neville even stops at the video store chats up a foxy mannequin. Hes working his way through the Gs. But come sunset its back to his townhouse where he yanks closed the steel shutters tightly turns the locks and curls up with his big German shepherd in the tub - hoping that they make it through the night. A virus that killed pretty much everyone turning all but the fewest of the few survivors into rabid night-crawling zombies (""dark seekers"" theyre called) hit the city and then the world in 2009. Neville a crack microbiologist who luckily is immune to the deadly strain has vowed to stay behind find a cure. (In the kitchen of his lovely home attached to the fridge is a Time magazine cover with his face on it; the headline reads ""Savior Soldier Scientist."") Directed by Francis Lawrence a music video guy (Britney J.Lo) who made his 2005 feature debut with Constantine a dark dopey comic book adaptation starring Keanu Reeves I Am Legend is essentially 28 Days Later . . . or 28 Weeks Later . . . only with millions more for special effects and with nothing approaching the heart-pounding bloodcurdling power and smarts of the two British-made yarns. What is good about I Am Legend - until it starts shooting itself in the proverbial foot leaving plot holes the size of New York potholes across the screen - is Smith alone or with his trusty pooch. There are long stretches of the film that are wonderfully quiet as Neville and Sam (short for Samantha) prowl around or sit by the South Street Seaport hoping a sane healthy human will drop by for a chat. Its almost as if the filmmakers wanted to say something about isolation and loneliness in the urban environment. Almost. And Smith is a true movie star He could stand alone before the camera reciting those page-long drug ad disclaimers and still command our attention. But then the explanatory flashbacks start coming and the viral dogs or Neville and Sam will stumble on a ""hive"" of crazed rabid flesh-chomping creepazoids. I Am Legend starts feeling like a high-end video game with very cool but not quite real digital effects with those endless troops of wild-eyed slimy all-sinew villains emerging into the dark banging their snarly heads against Nevilles door. And not that I want to reveal any SPOILERS but whos the knucklehead who signed off on a script that has helicopters destroying the bridges leading into and out of Manhattan - to isolate the infected - but forgot about the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels? How else do the woman and the kid who - oh never mind not going to go there. If youve got a logical explanation after youve seen I Am Legend let me know. I Am Legend 1/2 (Out of four stars) Directed by Francis Lawrence. With Will Smith Alice Braga Charlie Tahan Salli Richardson and Willow Smith. Distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures.

"Not Quite A Living Legend washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Not Quite A Living Legend Network News X Profile View More Activity Play Video TRAILER | I Am Legend TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 14 2007 When it comes to playing the hero in computer-generated sci-fi movies -- good medium or hokey -- Will Smith is our designated human. He has always seemed uncannily comfortable in any artificial realm. Who else conveys such goodwill and swagger as he stands up to hostile aliens (""Men in Black"" ""Independence Day"") or weathers a world of automated beings (""I Robot"")? And now in ""I Am Legend"" who else do we want as our last man standing in a futuristic Manhattan as the post-apocalyptic island becomes the hunting ground of flesh-eating mutants? They are remnants of humankind ghoulish beings who succumbed to a global virus. Somehow we figure Smith will find a cure for the race -- or what may or may not be left of it. And if he had surviving kids in this adaptation of Richard Mathesons dark 1954 novel we just know hed find time to pick them up at day care. He has a dog too by the way as if we couldnt have already guessed. The joy of the movie is watching the slow unfolding of a world circa 2012 in disaster. And theres a kick-back-and-enjoy-the-spectacle pleasure to watching Smith adapt. (Smith the actor and ""Robert Neville"" the character are pretty much the same presence but thats part of the celebrity-conscious fun.) Food gathering consists of taking out the sports utility vehicle and hunting deer (computer generated natch) as they leap and bound through the leafily overgrown cityscape. And for fun hell tee up on the wing of an abandoned fighter jet and send a golf ball arcing into the river. But at night its time to batten the hatches. Thats when the creatures of the night go marauding. And that alas is when ""I Am Legend"" starts its slow foundering. Although these creatures are compelling for their warp speed and aggression they are quite simply too superhuman. They move too fast and perfectly. They belong in a video game but not a big movie. And instead of keeping its edgy sense of constant discomfort which permeates the gripping first half of the movie the filmmakers seem compelled to make Smiths character as fuzzily adorable as possible. A little Smith already goes a long way and its hard to stay in like with him as he lapses into complete Teddy Bear messiah mode. He tells his pooch to eat her vegetables for goodness sake; and his race to cure those mutants becomes too precious too cheesy too zealous. At this point in our pop-cultural lives we are more than slightly savvy about CGI movies. The smallest flaw can irritate or detract from our pleasure. And its hard to hold on to our willful suspension of disbelief even with Smith to reassure us. Wheres the fleshy decayed post-sepulchral feeling of a vampire drama -- which was part of the original book? We are watching mutants assembled from binary zeroes and ones not creatures of the night. And they make us pull away from our enjoyable embrace of the movie. I Am Legend (114 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for violence and profanity.

"I Am Legend reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up I Am Legend reviewed. I Am Legend reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 13 2007 155 PM I Am Legend Will Smith roams a post-apocalyptic New York City. By Dana Stevens Will Smith is all alone in I Am Legend Note to human race Never try to cure cancer. Youll only end up with a faux-humble doctor (an uncredited Emma Thompson) bragging on cable news that a supervaccine is well on its way to eradicating the disease worldwide. Three years later in 2012 that vaccine will have morphed into a population-destroying superbug and youll be alone on the planet with Will Smith and a German shepherd. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. But there are worse people to be stranded with than Smith the star (and nearly the sole human presence) of Francis Lawrences I Am Legend (Warner Bros.) based on the 1954 sci-fi novel by Richard Matheson. Smith brings his customary what-doesnt-kill-me-makes-me-stronger pluck to the role of Robert Neville the military scientist who led the unsuccessful early fight against the virus and is conveniently immune to it as well. Smiths jaunty resilience helped him triumph over homelessness last year in The Pursuit of Happyness; whos to say it cant help him fight off the Infected i.e. the bald blood-drinking nocturnal mutants who have had the misfortune of surviving the plague? Advertisement For the first hour or more the film rides a surprisingly long way on a single ""Whoa dude"" visual idea What would Manhattan look like if all the human inhabitants died and nature began to take over? Washington Square Park choked with weeds Times Square overrun with deer all of midtown silent but for the cries of birds? These early lonely scenes shot on location at Manhattan landmarks that were incredibly emptied of humanity for at least a few hours filming have a haunting power. In an unusual departure from standard action-movie pacing the opening is unrushed and nearly dialogue-free (though the presence of Nevilles dog Sam does provide an excuse for some plot exposition as he drives around town confiding in the pup). Looking at a (digitally) collapsed Brooklyn Bridge you really do find yourself thinking about history the passage of time the decline of empires Sept. 11 ... and then night falls the Infected show up to storm Nevilles barricaded (but still covetable) West Village townhouse and youre safely back in Hollywood. A big part of the reason for this movies nose dive around the one-hour mark is that seen up close the Infected just arent that scary. Sure theyre startling when they pop out at you unexpectedly from the shadows but so is my building superintendent. As rendered by a combination of CGI and motion capture these beings--speeded-up zombies on the 28 Weeks Later model wearing only torn trousers a la Incredible Hulk--are too familiar to elicit more than a mild ""eww""; and the movie trots them out so often that they start to become almost cute. Nevilles most compelling struggles have little to do with his nightly battles with the Infected or his race to invent a vaccine in his basement lab. Its the mechanics of his day-to-day survival that are most fascinating for anyone whos imagined surviving doomsday. Its fun to watch him pump gas at an abandoned station or loot a Tribeca apartment for canned fish but Id like to know more about the crumbling infrastructure in which Neville lives. For example hes repeatedly frustrated in his attempts to shoot a deer and mentions at one point that hes been saving up a package of bacon--but why? If the city is his for the raiding and all the utilities appear (inexplicably but thats another story) to be operational wouldnt he have access to enough frozen meat for a lifetime? The logic of Nevilles post-apocalyptic world gets even fuzzier when a fellow survivor a devout Brazilian woman named Anna (Alice Braga) shows up with Ethan (Charlie Tahan) a silent prop who may or may not be her son; hes given nary a line of dialogue to establish his character. Having been reduced to flirting with store mannequins youd think Neville who lost a wife and daughter in the evacuation of Manhattan would weep with joy at the sight of a fellow human much less a hot-looking one. Instead hes suspicious of Annas motives and contemptuous of her claims about a survivors colony in Vermont (in his defense the only evidence she offers is ""God told me""). In a rushed and overheated final action sequence Neville does something thats either brave or stupid Anna says several things that are just stupid humanity is either saved or not (no spoilers here) and music swells. Mathesons novel has been adapted for the screen twice before with Vincent Price as The Last Man on Earth and Charlton Heston as The Omega Man but its hard to imagine either of those guys comforting their frightened dog by singing a Bob Marley song in its ear. Smith does so twice in I Am Legend and theyre two of the movies most touching moments. He may be a little perky to play Earths loneliest man but hes more than convincing as Hollywoods nicest guy.

That would be toward the end when the film starts taking leaps in plot development that feel out of character. Its as if director Francis Lawrence suddenly felt he was running out of time and needed to resolve things before the audience lost interest - something that until that point was in no danger of happening. The film based on the novel by Richard Matheson stars a buff Will Smith as soldier and scientist Robert Neville. He is as far as he knows the lone survivor of the outbreak of a virus that was originally engineered to cure cancer (Emma Thompson appears briefly as the doctor whose experiment goes so horribly awry). When we first meet Neville hes speeding through a barren broken New York in a sports car his German Shepherd Sam at his side and a high-powered rifle in his lap. Hes hunting - wild animals are the only living things left. Unless you classify as living the creatures the virus has turned the humans into. Not as explicitly vampirelike as in the novel - though they cant survive in the sunlight - theyre more like superquick zombies (evidently you lose your hair and a lot of weight while acquiring an appetite for human flesh). I Am Legend is fascinating and moving as we follow Neville through his day. He has all of New York to explore after all - as long as he gets home by dark. Rigidly disciplined he also has set up a lab in his well-stocked well-fortified home where he conducts experiments on animals and the occasional captured zombie creature in hopes of finding a cure that will restore victims to some semblance of normalcy. We learn through flashbacks what happened to Nevilles family along with the rest of the civilized world as the virus raged out of control. Now Neville is reduced to setting up mannequins in video stores so hell have someone - something - to flirt with some semblance of (mostly) human interaction. Lawrence is adept at creating suspense and as in a scene in which Neville stumbles upon a nest of the zombielike monsters out-and-out terror. If its a horror-movie cliche to make people jump at the possibility of whatevers around the corner its one that Lawrence pulls off with style. Smith has practically the whole movie to himself; luckily his presence is commanding enough to carry it off. His performance is assured and occasionally moving. Nothing if not a confident actor Smith still at times relies on goofy mannerisms and hokey behavior. Yet hes also capable of great emotion. Without giving too much away his heartbreak and desperation when hes forced to take matters into his own hands literally is one of the strongest moments in the film. Then things change. Its difficult to pinpoint when that change happens without giving away plot twists but the whole tenor of the film shifts. No longer a study in creepy isolation Legend becomes an action film with the central problem solved in an instant leading to a resolution that seems to belong in another film (or more likely a bad TV show). Its not a cop-out exactly just weirdly out of place. No one wants to hear that the books better but. . . . At least the considerable power of its ending is harder-won and thus feels more legitimate. As for the film I Am Legend is carried for a long while on the strength of Smiths performance but even he can carry it only so far.

"Movie review Will Smith makes I Am Legend tolerable - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeMovie review Will Smith makes I Am Legend tolerableBy Bruce NewmanMercury NewsPosted 12/12/2007 121320 PM PSTUpdated 12/13/2007 053601 AM PSTClick photo to enlargeWill Smith stars as Robert Neville in the new sci-fi action thriller ""I Am Legend.""<<123>>Lieutenant Colonel Savior Doctor Robert Neville is not what youd call a people person. But lets face it when youre The Last Man On Earth your people skills are bound to get a little rusty. Thats why it helps that Will Smith the peoples movie star plays Neville in ""I Am Legend"" Hollywoods third attempt to get the classic 1954 science fiction novel by Richard Matheson right. But even with Smith acting up a storm what starts out as a potentially fascinating picture about an apocalyptic plague soon devolves into yet another special-effects laden zombie movie. Smith manages to make this long lonely stretch tolerable keeping the movies tone light even when Neville starts to act a little creepy implying hed like to get jiggy with a mannequin he ""meets"" at the video store. (If he didnt put her there who did?) Smith also wrings considerable emotion from Nevilles relationship with his dog and carries the pictures action scenes with the same abundant swagger that has been his trademark since ""Independence Day"" his first spin through the sci-fi apocalypse. The movie begins with a research scientist explaining that she has bio-engineered a super-virus to reverse the effects of what is then the worlds greatest health scourge. ""So you have actually cured cancer?"" asks a television interviewer. ""Yes. Yes we have"" she replies. This claim appears to be true as far as it goes but overlooks a nasty side-effect of the super-virus which is superbad.Advertisement The next - and for a long time the last - person we see is Neville roaring around the eerily deserted streets of Manhattan in a bright red sports car. As director Francis Lawrence pulls back we see Times Square is covered in weeds and that all of New York has been transformed into a ghost town. When the sun goes down and the shrieking night sounds begin the ghosts are no longer metaphorical theyre real. Several flashbacks reveal what brought all this about not only to New York in general but to Neville - an officer in the military when the outbreak occurs - specifically. However the explanation for Nevilles immunity to a virus that has eradicated most of the worlds population seems to be ""just because."" Hes one crazy-courageous epidemiologist who insists on staying behind after New York is evacuated because dammit ""This is ground zero"" Its a jarring proclamation for a post-9/11 film set in New York and he makes it several times. Neville has a bit of a Christ complex - he keeps an old Time magazine cover with his picture and the headline ""Savior Doctor?"" on his refrigerator door - so it helps to have an actor with Smiths mix of personality and ego to hold the screen alone for more than an hour. But after its promising setup ""I Am Legend"" misses opportunity after opportunity to be more than a monster movie. With the very real threat of a global pandemic so recently in the air the movie has no apparent interest in either infection or panic. Or for that matter in the idea of closing borders to ward off undesirables; the movie uses this only as an opening for a computer-generated shot of the Brooklyn Bridge being blown apart to keep the ""infecteds"" in. ""Legend"" is full of incident but nothing much ever really happens. Smith tries to dig deeper than hes gone before to locate the psychological complexity of being so totally alone. But hes a naturally gregarious personality so every time he enters a room you can see him looking for a way to improvise a party. This meets with mixed results. You never sense the soul-crushing loneliness in him that the performance calls for but hes so good at humanizing his relationship with Nevilles dog that his fear of the dog becoming infected is palpable. The plagues infected survivors - both animal and human - come out only at night and are referred to at one point as ""dark seekers."" But again the movie has no interest in how this army of darkness was formed only in subjecting Smiths character to the customary array of zombie shock effects. Even the pictures most undeniably powerful visual - an uninhabited Manhattan at midday - finally gets so over-used that you may find yourself wondering as I did how the production really got all that traffic to stop.

Posted January 4 2008 -- 1200 AM EST In I Am Legend Will Smith as a U.S. Army officer who may be the last man on earth drives at top speeds through the concrete valleys of Manhattan which have been deserted for so long that the cracks in the roads now sprout scruffy green weeds. For sheer eeriness that effect -- the metropolis as vacant lot -- far outdoes the desolate Times Square of Vanilla Sky and Smith is the perfect actor (maybe almost too perfect) to play a survivor who has no one to talk to but his dog and himself. Smith has always worn his self-sufficiency like a suit of armor often treating costars as sounding boards; he brings that jaunty insularity to the abandoned canyons of a trashed Twilight Zone New York. Here though he also draws on the vulnerability he showed last year in The Pursuit of Happyness suggesting a man whose sanity is beginning to fray. Based on Richard Mathesons 1954 novel I Am Legend is a spooky-hokey postapocalyptic thriller built around our fear of contagion (the premise is that a ""miracle"" cancer cure has wiped out the earths population). Its a movie that might have fit snugly into the zeitgeist had it been made in the early 90s or maybe 1971 -- when in fact it was made as The Omega Man a somber but colossally silly Charlton Heston thriller. Lets be honest The peril of infectious disease while quite real is hardly the anxiety of the moment. In spirit I Am Legend is caught in some abstractly doom-laden sci-fi past. For what it is though the film is well-done a case of suspenseful competence trumping questionable relevance. Theres one scary sequence in which Smith follows his dog into a warehouse but as soon as you see the prancing gnashing veiny mutant humanoids who have taken up refuge there you think ""Okay its a fake-demon CGI movie."" And so it is though at least it never becomes a soulless monster-hunt videogame like Resident Evil. Smith who keeps the movie grounded isnt just surviving -- hes on a mission. In The Omega Man Heston faced a cult of white-faced hippie mutants in sunglasses and medieval monks robes. Sometimes CGI really is an advance. B Want more?

"I Am Legend | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; i-am-legend ) I Am Legend (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli I Am Legend the third cinematic adaptation of Richard Mathesons novel has been in development for a very long time. Originally slated to star Arnold Schwarzenegger and be directed by Ridley Scott this movie has kicked around for so long that by the time it has finally reached the screen Schwarzenegger is out of the business altogether and the director is someone whose career in music videos hadnt even started when Michael Bay was being touted as possible replacement for Scott. Nevertheless all these years later we finally have this new version of I Am Legend starring Will Smith as the Last Man on Earth and directed by Francis Lawrence (Constantine). I suppose its a common fantasy - believing that youre alone on the planet. The reality if it ever happened would be more the stuff of nightmares. When Matheson wrote I Am Legend; from which this movie takes its name its main character and certain events and themes; he was interested in exploring the hard aspects of what this kind of existence might really mean. Loneliness can drive a person slowly insane even if they guard against it. That lies at the core of I Am Legend - the psychological torment endured by the protagonist. That and the vampires. Mathesons book has often been credited as the ""inspiration"" for many of the modern-day zombie movies; his ""vampires"" have a kinship with George A. Romeros dead. Cinematically the creatures of this film most evidently echo (perhaps because of the circumstances) those in Danny Boyles 28 Days Later. In fact there are numerous similarities between that movie and I Am Legend not the least of which is that both feature a scenario in which an apocalypse occurs because of a disease and those who dont die turn into slavering raving monsters. I Am Legend opens in 2012 New York City - the most deserted place on Earth. Kudos to the special effects wizards for using computers to so effectively depopulate the city. Its eerie watching such emptiness. New York has a human population of one Dr. Robert Neville (Will Smith) an ex-military scientist who was to some degree culpable for what happened to his race. The disease was initially hyped as a cure for cancer (by Emma Thompson in an unbilled cameo) but it mutated and became a killer. The creatures it transforms cant emerge in the sunlight so they stay hidden during the day only to come out and seek fresh blood between dusk and dawn. In that period Robert and his faithful dog Sam are padlocked within his apartment. They hunt by day and hide by night. Robert is lonely and his loneliness is eroding his sanity. He talks to Sam as if she was a human. He speaks to department store mannequins he has dressed in clothing. He rents DVDs of old news shows not so much so he can revisit the past but so he can hear human voices and pretend hes not alone. In many ways its how Tom Hanks survived in Cast Away - by making a volleyball Wilson his best friend. Robert has set a broadcast to shout out his location on every station on the AM dial but so far no one has come looking. He uses a private lab in his apartment to continue research on the disease always searching for the elusive cure. If he could save one vampire - turn it back into a human - he would no longer be alone. Ghosts of his past haunt his dreams and its through those tortured flashbacks that we gain some knowledge of what the last hours were like for our kind. The first two-thirds of I Am Legend are superior to the fast-paced action-oriented final 35 minutes. Theres a key event that occurs just past the hour mark and after that the movie feels more like a typical Hollywood adventure than the introspective thought-provoking production that graces the screens for the first 65 minutes. The ending while not a complete cop-out diverges from that of Mathesons book and feels a little too convenient and facile. For most of the movie character drives plot. The closer we get to the conclusion the more plot drives character. There are some top-notch action sequences such as one in which vampires and vampire dogs attack Sam and an injured Robert. Theres also another scene in which Robert tries to take out an entire cell of vampires with nothing more than a speeding vehicle. There are some missteps - the deer chase is dumb and marred by CGI deer that look CGI. And the climactic struggle is less exciting than it should be. Theres a sense that some of the action was inserted into the movie to keep from losing the attention of younger viewers. Its okay for the movie to deal with intelligent ideas as long as there are enough bangs to enliven the proceedings. As Tom Hanks did in Cast Away Will Smith pulls off this half-insane role perfectly. Of course in addition to being alone Robert has other crosses to bear. He is hunted by the living dead. He carries a weight of guilt. And he knows on one level or another that he is responsible for what happened to his wife and daughter. Smith nails the portrayal. Its not the kind of work that will earn him an Oscar nomination but audiences usually dont see better than this in genre films. Science fiction fans hoping for a faithful adaptation of Mathesons novel will be disappointed. This is no more a visitation of the source material than its predecessors The Last Man on Earth or The Omega Man were. The updates are timely - the movie makes the suspension of disbelief curve as easy to ascend as it was in Children of Men. For me the most engaging aspects of the movie are connecting with Robert and understanding how he uses routine to survive each day. Its seeing the empty New York and understanding how its desolation offers both solace and pain. For the most part the action sequences work - and they are directed in a straightforward manner that thankfully does not rely on fast cuts and shaky camera movement - but they are not the real reason to see this movie. Cautionary tale though it might be I Am Legend offers a window into a future that probably wont be but that is easily believed within the context of this workmanlike motion picture.

(For a few weeks every New York traffic report seemed to end And Fifth Avenue/lower Manhattan/Times Square is closed off for the Will Smith movie.) The director Francis Lawrence clearly grooves on the visual gimmickwide-open spaces alternating with claustrophobic dens as Smith closes himself up in his Washington Square brownstone while the ghouls howl and moan outside. Then some boring characters show up and a dangling cross on a rearview mirror signals faith and hope are about to make a dispiriting comeback. The finale is swift and senseless. So far no one has gotten the ending of this story right.

Remarkably eerie yet annoyingly larded with cheap horror-film shock effects ""I Am Legend"" stands as an effective but also irksome adaptation of Richard Mathesons classic 1954 sci-fi novel. In what is to a considerable extent a solo turn as the last healthy human on a post-plague planet Earth Will Smith strongly holds the screen in a one-man Alamo besieged by marauding cannibals. Potent B.O. looms worldwide. Mathesons pioneering novel which worked a lot of science into a story populated by vampiric predators hasnt fared too well on the bigscreen thus far. First adaptation the 1964 Vincent Price starrer ""The Last Man on Earth"" lensed in Italy by helmer Sidney Salkow was a cheesy affair while the 1971 ""The Omega Man"" toplining Charlton Heston under Boris Sagals direction murkily altered the story to put the leading man up against an albino cult called ""the Family."" A direct-to-vid item called ""I Am Omega"" (from the Asylum specialists in parasitic low-budget versions of big-budget studio fare) has just been produced. The scripters of ""The Omega Man"" get credit on this new version (curiously given the many differences between the two films) initially penned by Mark Protosevich when Warner Bros. first announced a remake a decade ago. That pic was to have toplined Arnold Schwarzenegger with Ridley Scott directing; at various points in the interim Tom Cruise and Michael Douglas have been attached as stars as was Michael Bay as director. Akiva Goldsman subsequently came aboard to help produce and give the script a final go. Following a brief prologue (featuring a TV clip of an uncredited Emma Thompson as a doctor announcing a cure for cancer) the opening minutes are breathtaking in their haunting imagery. The setting is a desolate Manhattan parts of it unchanged but others in ruins upholstered in part by grass and weeds and with abandoned vehicles jammed together. Billboards for ""Hairspray"" ""Rent"" and ""Wicked"" still adorn Times Square but the only living beings in evidence are some flying birds a herd of stampeding deer and a family of lions stealthily hunting its dinner. And then there is one man Robert Neville (Smith) first seen racing a red-and-white Shelby Mustang GT 500 through the canyons of midtown in the company of his German shepherd. Neville carries a high-powered rifle and tries to get off a shot at a deer but returns empty-handed to his Washington Square apartment which appears well stocked with food and other goods. Although he holds back from embracing the genuinely surreal director Francis Lawrence (""Constantine"") displays a strong sensitivity to the majesty of desolation (he was reportedly inspired by John Fords Western landscapes). Setup also creates a genuine sense of curiosity and fear about what else might lurk out there something shortly indicated when Neville battens down the hatches for the night and curls up with his dog in an empty bathtub while dreadful howls and screams surround them from outside. Doled out in flashbacks are glimpses of how three years earlier Manhattan was quarantined due to the outbreak of a devastating man-made virus. A military scientist Neville proved to be uniquely immune and so remained on the island after seeing his wife and daughter off in a spectacular nocturnal evacuation scene staged with hordes of extras near the Brooklyn Bridge. Convinced hes the last normal man alive Neville retains his sanity by following a rigorous routine and spends his days roving around Manhattan hunting for other survivors -- humans who due to infection have turned into zombie-like cannibals who normally venture out only at night. When he captures any -- a very dangerous business -- hes able to continue his desperate experiments at finding a cure his one hope for perpetuating recognizable human life. Unfortunately the more the film dwells in -- for lack of a better term -- zombie territory the more director Lawrence resorts to stock-in-trade shock cuts designed expressly to rattle the viewer. Sometimes theres a payoff sometimes not but the tenor of the picture steadily declines the more this sort of thing is indulged in. On top of that no matter how skillfully the CGI creatures have been rendered theyre also tiresome (all they do is run and roar) familiar (in their hairless hideousness they resemble Ralph Fiennes Voldemort in the ""Harry Potter"" series) and implausible (their inhuman speed strength and agility are unbelievable even in context). Bad villains bring any genre film down several notches. Eventually Neville encounters two more uncontaminated humans the young Brazilian Anna (Alice Braga ""City of God"") and Ethan (Charlie Tahan) a boy shes minding giving rise to the hope there may be more like them out there somewhere. Although Smiths role may not be as difficult in certain ways as Tom Hanks was in ""Cast Away"" -- Smith gets to move around a lot indulge in eye-catching action scenes and interrelate with a wonderful dog rather than a volleyball -- they are comparable in that both parts required the actors to carry their films virtually singlehandedly with long silent passages. Smith manages it very well showboating only briefly to show off his newly trim physique and intermittently displaying the incipient madness that would surely come from being alone against an unrelenting threat. Thesps greatest scene which reps an inspired staging choice on the directors part consists of a prolonged agonizing closeup of Neville dealing with his dog after its been contaminated; youre thankful not to have to watch what hes doing and the powerful emotions Smith expresses are riveting to behold. Casting of the little-known Braga and the spectacular gravity and calm she brings to the surrounding chaos reps another major plus even if the immediately ensuing zombie attack returns things to a B-picture level. What remain most memorable about the picture are the images of a stark uninhabited New York City; to this end production designer Naomi Shohan the large art department and visual effects teams and lenser Andrew Lesnie contributed much imagination and expertise.
