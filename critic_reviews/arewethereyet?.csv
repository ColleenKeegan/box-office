Film Add review 0 Love It Save it 0 Add review 0 Love It Save it Time Out says Details Users say Time Out says No were not. Were here watching Ice Cube in full-on family entertainment mode as he plays Nick a smooth bachelor who has amorous designs on sexy divorcee Suzanne (Nia Long) a local woman who he spies one day through the window of the distinctly macho sports goods emporium that he runs (successfully we assume considering the jewellery around his neck and the shiny SUV parked outside) in a quiet affluent corner of suburban America. Unfortunately for him Nicks devotion to Suzanne is tested when she suggests he drives her two pre-teen kids to Vancouver where she is stuck on business. Of course the silly man nods like a puppy so initiating a tiresome road trip with little Lindsey (Aleisha Allen) and Kevin (Philip Bolden) who are (quite rightly) suspicious of this strangers motives. Their real dad is currently neglecting them for a new woman; its up to Nick to prove to these kids and their mum that not all men are bad.The rest is all about mining comedy from the road crashes delays creepy strangers exploding cars... Brain food it aint.

Scott Foundas Chief Film Critic foundasonfilm 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr January 17 2005 | 0900PM PT A joyless road-trip comedy thats about as pleasant as a bad case of car sickness ""Are We There Yet?"" traps the affable Ice Cube in a dismal kiddy slapstick saga that even his considerable charisma can do little to enhance. Pic offers past-their-prime sight gags and (literal) toilet humor marked by a sadistic edge that may give parents pause. A joyless road-trip comedy thats about as pleasant as a bad case of car sickness (which happens to be one of pics prominent gags) ""Are We There Yet?"" traps the affable Ice Cube in a dismal kiddy slapstick saga that even his considerable charisma can do little to enhance. Seemingly greenlit in the wake of last years sleeper hit ""Johnson Family Vacation"" pic offers past-their-prime sight gags and (literal) toilet humor marked by a sadistic edge that may give parents pause. Bigscreen biz should be but a rest stop before this rickety vehicle parks itself in video and cable outlets. The owner of a Portland sports memorabilia store and a reputed ladies man Nick Persons (Ice Cube) treats his pimped-out Lincoln Navigator like a newborn infant. As far as real children go though Nick considers them ""like cockroaches except you cant squish em."" But thats before Nicks eye is caught by sexy divorcee Suzanne (Nia Long) who runs the party planning business across the street. Soon Nicks in hot pursuit no matter that Suzanne is a ""breeder"" with two young tykes Lindsey (Aleisha Allen) and Kevin (Philip Daniel Bolden). The kids meanwhile caught up in the fantasy that their mom is still in love with their deadbeat dad are willing to do whatever it takes to prevent Suzanne from dating any other men. When Suzanne is called away to Vancouver to plan a major New Years Eve party her ex feigning sickness bows out of baby-sitting duties. So Nick despite every bone in his body (and the talking Satchel Paige bobblehead that serves as his Jiminy Cricketlike conscience) telling him not to volunteers to take care of Suzannes kids. Thus the stage is set for a series of would-be comic mishaps in which Nick attempts by plane train and automobile to take Suzannes children to her in Vancouver in time for New Years. Of course Lindsey and Kevin have other ideas -- specifically to get to their dads house while making every minute as miserable as possible for chauffeur Nick. Helmer Brian Levant previously supervised similar mischief-making on such pics as ""Beethoven"" ""Jingle All the Way"" and ""Snow Dogs."" But even the titular devil-child of his ""Problem Child 2"" seems oddly angelic when compared to Lindsey and Kevin who engage in a series of dangerous and/or unsavory antics including convincing a kindly trucker (M.C. Gainey) that Nick is a kidnapper. That last gag (which recurs throughout pic) seems particularly ill-conceived in light of recent high-profile child abductions but its of a piece with a film in which Nick Lindsey and Kevin are frequently placed in peril. Of course comic violence is nothing new -- the ""Home Alone"" franchise thrived on it -- but theres something more violent than comic about the way Levant executes sequences here. More problematic is the fact that Lindsey and Kevin are so shrill self-righteous and flat-out mean that its tough to care about them. Even the youngest members of pics audience may be put off by the tykes bad behavior. (At the screening reviewed during one scene in which Nick calmly reassures the kids that the utter destruction of his car isnt really their fault one audience member felt compelled to shout out ""Yes it is"") When pic tries to turn sentimental in its final stretch suggesting that Lindsey and Kevin are the victims of conflicting emotions stemming from their parents separation it seems particularly unbelievable. Shot entirely in Vancouver pics tech aspects are strictly serviceable with lots of the driving scenes clearly done on a soundstage. But considerable time and CGI attention does seem to have been lavished on the talking Paige doll which ranks with the sea creatures of ""The Life Aquatic"" among recent movies most unnecessary special effects.

(AP Photo/Columbia Pictures/ Rob McEwan) In this photo provided by Columbia Pictures (l to r) Aleisha Allen Philip Daniel Bolden and Ice Cube star in Revolution Studios family comedy ""Are We There Yet?"" (AP Photo/Columbia Pictures/ Rob McEwan) Photo ROB MCEWAN Cool customer Ice Cube tormented by nasty kids in unpleasant road comedy 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Are We There Yet? Comedy. Starring Ice Cube Nia Long Philip Bolden and Aleisha Allen. Directed by Brian Levant. (PG. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Ice Cube has made a slew of funny comedies in recent years playing impassive straight men in films populated by zany lewd or crazy characters. ""Are We There Yet?"" takes the somber Cube persona and puts him on a road trip with two horribly bratty children with the idea that watching Cube cope with kids will be funny. But the film suffers from a fundamental miscalculation Theres nothing fun about watching a nice guy get tortured by a pair of little monsters. The picture was directed by Brian Levant who in 1991 directed something called ""Problem Child 2"" which no one remembers except film critics still dealing with the trauma. Like the earlier film ""Are We There Yet?"" shows children behaving in ways that go right to the edge of absolute evil and who are snotty and charmless besides. At the same time the movie demands that we should feel warm toward those kids after all. What makes ""Are We There Yet?"" even harder to take is that it places Cube in a position in which he cant discipline the kids. He plays Nick a friend of the childrens mother (Nia Long). Hoping to move the relationship from a friendship to a romance he volunteers to fly with the kids from Portland Ore.  to Vancouver where shes stuck on a business trip. The kids take an instant dislike to Nick whom they see as an obstacle to their parents getting back together. They dont seem to grasp that their father is happily remarried has a new baby and wants nothing to do with them. The movie tries to make this negligent dad into an offscreen villain but after 15 minutes with his kids anyone could appreciate his point of view. Laughter is often a response to suddenly apprehending the truth. ""Are We There Yet?"" which provokes no laughs trades mainly in falsehoods -- about people about emotions even about how things work. Nick and the kids (Aleisha Allen and Philip Bolden) are all set to get on a plane when young Kevin slips a corkscrew into Nicks jacket setting alarms off at the metal detector. In real life that would result in confiscation of the corkscrew. In the movie it gets them banned from the flight. This is followed by a train station fiasco which in turn introduces the main section of the story -- the road trip in which the three set out to make the trip by car in our heros brand-new Navigator. Hes very proud of that Navigator. So what do you think they do to his car? Long is a radiant sensitive actress and shes very good in an early scene as a career woman trying to be a good mother and struggling with an ex- husband who has essentially abandoned the family. But the character she plays falls victim to the screenplays adherence to formula which requires that she become angry with Nick at a certain point even if she has no reason. Four screenwriters are credited with this sloppy piece of work. Divide the embarrassment into quarters. At least Cube doesnt embarrass himself. Cube is always Cube. Hes not exactly an actor with a range but he always seems true. Here thats almost a problem. We see him truly in love truly trying truly tormented truly abused and truly misunderstood. Its not a pleasant spectacle. -- Advisory This film contains rude talk and has scenes of children behaving disrespectfully.

Never mind his fruitful forays both in front of and behind the camera. Ice Cube -- born OShea Jackson -- always takes us back head nodding fingers snapping exclaiming ""No he didnt say that."" (Yes he did.) Ice Cube right with Jerry Hardin in the would-be family picture ""Are We There Yet?"" (Rob Mcewan -- Revolution Studios) _____More in Movies_____  Are We There Yet? National Showtimes  Watch the Trailer  Movie Trailer Library  Profile Ice Cube  Current Movie Openings  Arts amp; Living Movies Free E-mail Newsletters Washington Entertainment GuideSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now MoviesSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now TravelSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now At HomeSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now So were having trouble reconciling our ""AmeriKKKas Most Wanted"" image of Ice Cube with the Cube found in ""Are We There Yet?"" his latest and most unfortunate cinematic endeavor. True his PG-rated evolution was gradual from ""Boyz n the Hood"" to ""Three Kings"" to the ""Barbershop"" franchise. And hes not the only bad boy to go the family film route. (Think Eddie Murphy.) Fatherhood suburban living -- not to mention a nice fat paycheck -- have a funny way of changing even the most reprobate of entertainers. It would help if ""Are We There Yet?"" was any good. We were disabused of this notion very early on right about the time the Satchel Paige bobblehead on the dashboard of Cubes Lincoln Navigator started dispensing love advice. Perhaps talking bobbleheads are the new red flag for filmmakers desperately trying to milk laughs. Directed by Brian Levant (""Jingle All the Way"" ""The Flintstones"") ""Are We There Yet?"" is your standard road movie sprinkled with a little hip-hop flava Nick (Cube) runs a sports collectibles shop (ergo the animated Satchel Paige voiced by ""SNL"" alum Tracy Morgan). Nick loves his ""blingage"" the platinum chains bouncing on his chest; he loves his spanking-new Navigator with the spinning rims; and he loves the ladies. He does not however love kids ""Kids are like cockroaches"" he opines. ""Except that you cant squish them."" Nice. Of course he soon falls in love with a lady with kids Suzanne (Nia Long). They meet contrived-cute do the ""just friends"" courtship dance and then for reasons too implausible to get into (something about a deadbeat ex and Nicks urge to get Suzanne in the sack) hes on the road with her two young kids Lindsey and Kevin driving from Portland Ore. to Vancouver Canada rushing to get there before New Years Eve. Her kids of course hate Nick as much as he hates them. ""Youre just a dirty horny sex man like all the rest"" Lindsey tells him. The kids do everything they can to derail Nick including framing him with a corkscrew at airport security -- high jinks that force them onto the open road. (Its one of the movies few laugh-aloud moments along with the kickboxing deer.) Its a sure bet that everything will be tied up in a neat little Whos Your Daddy moment. Just as its a sure bet that somewhere along the way one of the kids is going to hurl all over Nicks new Navigator. The script seems to be coming at you straight outta development hell. The film credits four writers Maybe one for the ""urban"" references. One for the sports references. One to throw in the road movie cliches. Were still figuring out what the fourth was for to impose narrative structure? Nah. Instead weve got stereotypes-a-go-go Raging redneck truckers. Accented Asians. Country bumpkins. Black fathers missing in action. The humors a tad too raunchy for the kids and the predictable plot wont win over any of the parents. Were not mad at Cube who also served as co-producer for trying to make a flick that his kids could see. We are mad at him though for wasting Long (and for putting her in a really bad wig). Hes wasting his own time too Cube has talent and charm to spare. Get them both some decent material. (And get those kids Aleisha Allen and Philip Bolden out of acting class Theyre too cute and too choreographed.) And whats with the title? Its too easy but we cant resist and so we wont Were not there yet. God no. Not by a long shot. Are We There Yet? (91 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for profanity and rude humor much of it provided by a rather unfortunate animated bobblehead.

"Ice Cubes Rocky Road Trip washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids Ice Cubes Rocky Road Trip Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday January 21 2005 UNLIKE ICE CUBES character Nick in ""Are We There Yet?"" -- a child-hating ""playah"" who learns to love his lady friends (Nia Long) two bratty kids while trapped in a car with them during a long road trip -- I started out this journey actually liking children. By the end of the movie I wasnt so sure. Phony and formulaic from start to finish the movie may make some viewers feel as if theyre trapped in a car themselves with a driver who wont pull over. Instead of two ill-mannered crumb-snatchers however we in the audience have to deal with three since Nick himself often behaves with as much insufferable immaturity as his juvenile companions (Philip Daniel Bolden a product of the extruded-plastic child-actor factory and the somewhat more lifelike Aleisha Allen). Make that four. I forgot for a second the talking Satchel Paige bobblehead doll sitting on the dashboard which provides courtesy of Tracy Morgans voice and some digital animation a running commentary on the proceedings which can be boiled down to this the exploitation of children for sexual opportunism. In other words as the voluble six-inch piece of sports memorabilia points out over and over again Nick has taken on this chauffeuring gig simply to get into his womans pants. More bizarre than funny the wisecracking Greek chorus of one is an idea that never should have made it past the second draft of the screenplay. Oh wait there was no second draft. At least there doesnt appear to have been despite or perhaps because of the four (count em four) credited screenwriters whom I will spare the indignity of mentioning. Oh what the heck Steven Gary Banks Claudia Grazioso J. David Stem and David N. Weiss. Look they didnt spare me the projectile vomiting scene. You knew that was coming didnt you? That and the urinary incontinence not to mention all the other things that can go wrong while traveling with children. But what you really knew was coming as anyone who has ever sat through a road movie like this ought to know is the bogus script-induced epiphany during which our beleaguered travelers bond over -- well frankly I have no idea. If you buy it when Nick says suddenly and for no apparent reason after all his charges have subjected him to ""You guys are some cool kids"" I can only admire your um refreshing lack of cynicism. By the end of the film when Nick is shown giving the kids some of his gem-encrusted jewelry as a token of his affection I had given up expecting anything let alone real emotion from a movie in which bling equals love. ARE WE THERE YET? (PG 91 minutes) -- Contains brief mild vulgarity mild sexual humor ethnic and bathroom jokes and child endangerment for comedic purposes. Area theaters.

"Foul There is not a place you want to go - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Foul There is not a place you want to go By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  January 21 2005 In the decade since he arrived in Hollywood Ice Cube has played all kinds of cops thugs soldiers and barbers. He even directed a movie about a strip club thats fondly thought of as the black Showgirls."" But perhaps sensing that it might be time to do a movie he could watch with his own children the rapper finally made himself a nice family comedy.Whether Are We There Yet?"" which he produced will melt the lil Cubes remains to be seen but this gnarly and illogical little sitcom is bound to make any adult reconsider that next outing with the kids.Cube plays Nick Parsons the owner of a sports memorabilia store in Portland Ore. and he cant stand children especially the ones that come attached to cute bachelorettes. But he battles his disdain when he meets a single mother of two named Suzanne; since shes played by Nia Long you can understand his willingness to compromise. But you cant entirely grasp how this levelheaded woman could produce a pair of children as super-obnoxious as Lindsey and Kevin (the dangerously spunky Aleisha Allen and Philip Bolden) whom Nick not inaccurately calls gremlins.""Suzannes kids are so convinced that their father will rejoin their big happy home that they turn terrorist on their mothers new prospects subjecting them to bruising contraptions thatwouldnt be out of place in Home Alone 12.""I feel sorry for the next sucker that tries to put the moves on her"" says Kevins big sister. So do we Lindsey so do we -- though not as sorry as anyone who sticks around for the ensuing kicks to the crotch projectile vomit feigned asthma attacks faked kidnappings gassy old ladies and a belligerent computer-enhanced deer.Theres also a terrifying scene in which Kevin urinates on a woman in a ladies public restroom and one scarier in which Lindsey gets her hands on a live microphone and belts out a version of Respect"" that could be sold as a car alarm.All this foulness arises after Suzannes ex-husband cancels their arrangement for him to bring the kids to Vancouver. Shes an events coordinator and has to be there for New Years. Dad is out but St. Nick is in.Of course getting Lindsey and Kevin north of the border proves a nightmare. After being evicted from the airport (Kevin slips a pocket knife into Nicks coat) then missing the train (Kevin hops off to fetch a missing cape for his superhero toy) Nick dares drive them in his brand new Lincoln Navigator. Lining the interior with plastic and barking commandments -- dont touch the SUV dont eat in the SUV and so on -- is merely an invitation to destroy it.It took four writers and director Brian Levant who also made Jingle All the Way"" The Flintstones"" and Snow Dogs"" to come up with this cartoon. Yet despite its faults Are We There Yet?"" is the rare movie to acknowledge the vast bandwidth of African-American identity which extends out of the ghetto and into the suburbs and the middle class. Both kids have an allergic reaction to the music of hip-hop roughneck 50 Cent. Id give him a dollar to shut up"" Lindsey snipes. Kevin prefers Clay Aiken and Nick bemoans that both children are ethnically challenged.""The film also has an asset in Ice Cube. Hes so genuinely good with the effortless Long that you wish the two would just run off and make a real adult romantic comedy. Then again -- if youve been waiting to see the ex-NWA rapper throw tantrums and stick his tongue out at small children -- run dont walk.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Well not quite thereBy Claudia Puig USA TODAY Are We There Yet? is not worth the ride. Nick (Ice Cube) has his hands full with Philip Bolden who plays his girlfriends son. Columbia Pictures Thats too bad because moviegoers could use a good family comedy now that many of the holiday movies have played out. But one that simply is going through the motions is hardly worth making. There are several feeble efforts to make us chuckle gross us out with the obligatory bodily function gags and tug on our heartstrings. Theres even a harrowing car chase and an explosion. Because of the non-stop cinematic cliches most moviegoers will be itching to take a detour. Too bad for Ice Cube. Hes a winning presence with an appealing deadpan comic shtick in the Barbershop movies as well as here. But hes hampered by the subpar work of the four writers responsible for the story. About the movie Are We There Yet?  1/2 (out of four) Stars Ice Cube Nia Long Aleisha Allen Philip Bolden Jay Mohr Director Brian Levant Distributor Revolution Studios Rated PG for language and rude humor Opens Friday nationwide Ice Cube plays Nick a slick bachelor with a tricked-out ride that he uses to help out an attractive single mom Suzanne (Nia Long) whos stranded. Though were supposed to like her and appreciate her concern for her children she comes across as arch and a bit of a user. She makes it clear that shes dismayed by Nicks lack of interest in her children so he calculatedly offers to ferry them on a 300-mile trip from Portland Ore. to Vancouver to meet her on a business trip. It turns out the kids are just as calculated. They want their divorced parents to reunite and do everything they can to thwart Nick. Seven-year-old son Kevin (Philip Bolden who has one of the cutest grins imaginable) spills juice urinates vomits and sets Nick up for arrest at an airport. Eleven-year-old Lindsey (Aleisha Allen) is a snitch and a scold who grabs the wheel of Nicks beloved Lincoln Navigator and is responsible for its eventual destruction. She also pretends Nick has kidnapped them which results in bedlam and another arrest. Somehow despite all their efforts to evade and humiliate him and all the mayhem they cause Nick cant help falling in love with the tykes. He goes from lack of interest to disgust to devoted parental love in only 12 hours when hes reminded of the pain inflicted on children of divorce. Would that every hurt child could be granted such a fairy-tale ending. The suffering of children whose parents divorce is a serious and difficult subject and its laudable that a comedy tries to address it even clumsily and superficially. Still its a shame Ice Cube chose this clunker of a vehicle for his first family film. As it meanders in predictable circles Are We There Yet? never arrives at any entertaining destination.

Rob Mcewan) C Are We There Yet? Starring Ice Cube; Starring Aleisha Allen Philip Daniel Bolden Nia Long; Director Brian Levant; Release Date Wide 01/21/2005; Runtime (in minutes) 94; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor Sony Pictures Entertainment Posted January 19 2005 -- 1200 AM EST Its been a while since we saw a bad John Hughes comedy and Are We There Yet? more than fits the bill (even though Hughes had absolutely nothing to do with it). The movie was developed and co-produced by its star Ice Cube and it represents a clear attempt after the friendly and mildly provocative folkloric raunch of the Friday and Barbershop series to mainstream his image even further -- to prove he can be a PG player in a Hollywood increasingly devoted to family-friendly high jinks. Are We There Yet? opens on a snowy tree-lined residential block at Christmastime then kicks off with two incorrigible children 11-year-old Lindsey (Aleisha Allen) and 7-year-old Kevin (Philip Daniel Bolden who has a great baby-rascal face) subjecting their divorced mothers latest suitor to a mini-version of a Home Alone slapstick spillathon. Welcome to Cubes version of Hughesville. Smiling more often than he has in all of his previous films and music videos combined he plays Nick the owner of a sports-collectibles store and an unapologetic bachelor. Nick has just purchased a spiffy new babe-mobile SUV complete with spinning hubcaps when he spies and falls for Suzanne (Nia Long) an elite party planner and the aforementioned single mom. The feeling is mutual or at least could be but her attitude is Love me love my kids. Its up to Nick to prove his fealty by shepherding the two junior monsters on a voyage to Vancouver. At this point Are We There Yet? becomes Planes Trains and Automobiles with one gruff straight man in medallions and oversize sports jerseys facing off against a couple of cute brats who are too precocious for the room. It is of course no contest. After Kevin plants a corkscrew on Nick at airport security the three have to travel by car and Nicks exasperation only mounts as hes forced to listen to plastic dance pop then hold Kevin aloft as he pees in the sink then watch as his shiny new Navigator gets punctured vomited on and generally trashed mile by mile. At the end of 94 minutes you can bet hes been converted into a faithful surrogate daddy. But will the audience follow Ice Cube on this road trip to benign banality? Heres hoping he books a nonstop return ticket.
