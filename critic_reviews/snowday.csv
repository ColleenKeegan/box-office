A snowfall results in school being closed down but the tepid preteen John Hughes imitation that follows might as well have taken place during normal class hours. Theres an insipid romance and four cardboard villains to hiss at notably the dentally challenged Snowplowman (Chris Elliott) who likes to -- yes -- crush things under his snowplow. As the towns paternal weatherman Chevy Chase who looks more defanged with each movie must at least have earned a mansion payment or two.

The story of a mystical snow days transformative effects on one family pic isnt likely to take the country by storm but with separate storylines calculated to target kids adolescents and young adults it should do respectable numbers. A family film thats about as fluffy as fresh powder ""Snow Day"" mixes a cast of familiar faces with bright new talent in an unremarkable innocuous package. The story of a mystical snow days transformative effects on one family pic isnt likely to take the country by storm but with separate storylines calculated to target kids adolescents and young adults it should do respectable numbers. The Brandstons are a comically dysfunctional family Dad Tom (Chevy Chase) a down-and-out meteorologist is forced by his producer (Pam Grier) to don wacky costumes in an effort to improve his ratings. Toms wife Laura (Jean Smart) works so much that she barely has time to notice that their youngest child (Connor Matheus) has a hyperactivity disorder. Ten-year-old daughter Natalie (Zena Grey) passes the time playing with her pals and her brothers action figures. And teenage son Hal (Mark Webber) pines after brown-eyed beauty Claire (Emmanuelle Chriqui) unaware that his best friend Lane (Schuyler Fisk) is in love with him. Amid one of the warmest Syracuse winters on record Natalie prays desperately for snow. Though Tom spots a low pressure zone heading east the sudden miraculous snowfall takes everyone by surprise. To the childrens delight school is canceled but soon an unwanted intruder threatens to ruin their fun Its the nefarious Snowplowman (Chris Elliott) the local ""snow day assassin."" Driving a smoke-spewing black big rig Snowplowman is feared by children all over the region; folklore has it that he cloaks his tires with chains made from the braces of dead kids. Determined to stop Snowplowman in his tracks Natalie tries to ensure an unprecedented second snow day. Meanwhile Hal finds innovative ways to tell Claire hes crazy for her but soon finds his efforts thwarted by her furious ex-boyfriend Chuck (David Paetkau). Tom tries to prove himself the regions best weatherman going head-to-head with his better-looking rival local favorite Chad Symmonz (John Schneider). Each tale divides almost too neatly into a dichotomous framework of good opposing bad Natalie vs. Snowplowman Hal vs. Chuck Tom vs. Chad Mom vs. her busy schedule. This being a family film its not hard to guess which side wins but there are obstacles aplenty on the path to victory including a snowmobile chase that has Hal trying to outrun Chuck a showdown between courageous young Natalie and the evil Snowplowman and a couple of surprises for Tom and Laura. Helmer Chris Koch a veteran of Nickelodeon TV series makes a commendable feature debut inserting enough PG-rated scatological humor to win over the preteen set. Likewise teens may respond to the Hal-Claire storyline and fans of Chase and Elliott should appreciate the good nature with which they endure various indignities. Tech elements are fine and thesping particularly notable by the casts distaff side Young Grey is a firecracker of talent; Fisk (whose parents are Jack Fisk and Sissy Spacek) delivers a lovely unaffected performance and Chriqui is a sparkling doe-eyed beauty.

Starring Mark Webber Zena Grey Schuyler Fisk Emmanuelle Chriqui Chevy Chase Chris Elliott Jean Smart Pam Grier. Directed by Chris Koch. (PG. 89 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) It may be impossible for Californians to truly appreciate the sense of liberation -- or for parents the dread -- that attends the phenomenon known in the Northeast and Midwest as ""snow day"" when schools are forced to close because of weather. The new film ""Snow Day"" catches snippets of the flavor of such an event. But mere flavors arent enough to sustain this mechanical rollout of dopey gags. A Nickelodeon production aimed at preteens ""Snow Day"" is lame comedy that might have trouble prompting even chuckles from its target audience. But theres a sprinkle of sweetness in the core story of a high school boy named Hal (Mark Webber) who cant muster the courage to approach the girl of his dreams Claire (Emmanuelle Chriqui) while his little sister Natalie (Zena Gray) dreams and schemes to turn one beautiful snow day into two. The film knots too many half-baked plot lines into its 89 minutes (which seems more like two hours). Plot fragments collide with inane desperate gags -- a fat kid is predictably flatulent not just once but over and over -- and the film becomes a sprawling mess. Its lifeless too. Unable to meld hokey comedy elements into the wistful romance first-time director Chris Koch has turned ""Snow Day"" into a dull disjointed affair. Even its veteran players -- Chevy Chase Jean Smart and Pam Grier -- add little energy. Too bad. The concept has wonderful possibilities. The film gets the ball rolling with its suburban Syracuse N.Y. setting sweltering under an unseasonable warm spell. Local TV weatherman Tom Brandston (Chase) wears tropical outfits on air in a spoof of TV weathermen that may fly right over the audiences heads. But his oldest kids Hal and Natalie hope against hope for a break from school that a snow day would bring. When a sudden storm bears down from Canada the suburb is smothered by heavy snow. ""Snow Day"" looks promising for a moment. The kids are free; the parents are thrown into a dither by unexpectedly having them at home. The weather also means that the feared weirdo snowplow driver (Chris Elliott) who scrapes roads with a devilish grin is back in action. To kids who might get in his way while sledding hes a fiendish monster aiming to mow them down. Chase is so dull in this film he looks as if hes sleepwalking. Smart plays his wife Laura a workaholic sales exec stuck at home with their youngest kid 6-year-old Randy (Connor Matheus) who requires a lot of attention. The main focus is on teenager Hal and his inept pursuit of dream-girl Claire. This strand of plot actually engenders some interest as Hal schemes to make contact with the pretty girl who doesnt notice him while his best friend Lane (Schuyler Fisk) tries her best to get him to notice her. Wait for the video. ..

"Snow Day | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; snow-day ) Snow Day (United States 2000) A movie review by James Berardinelli No matter how old you grow you never forget the rare and special magic associated with a snow day. Theres nothing quite like the experience of waking up to a virgin blanket of white and realizing that at least for one day the normal drudgery of lectures quizzes and homework has been suspended in favor of building snow forts and snowmen and engaging in snowball fights. Of course theres no such thing as a free lunch and a day off now has to be made up later. But somehow going one extra day in June seems to be a bargain for an unexpected vacation in the heart of winter. Chris Kochs feature debut Snow Day (not to be confused with Snow Days an indie romantic comedy that played at the 2000 Sundance Film Festival) uses the concept of a snow day as the backdrop for a fantasy/comedy that at its best is cute and at its worst is uninspired. This is one of those low-intelligence pictures aimed squarely at the under-11 crowd that doesnt do much to endear itself to older viewers (unless youre one of the nine active members of the Chevy Chase fan club or the five active members of the Chris Elliot fan club). The biggest laughs are reserved for the flatulence jokes and the scenes in which the school principal is pelted with snowballs. The action takes place in Syracuse New York on the day when a record snowfall paralyzes the community shutting schools and businesses and keeping nearly everyone stranded at home. In the Branston household this means that workaholic mom Laura (Jean Smart) has to telecommute while taking care of her toddler son Randy. Tom (Chevy Chase) the only weather man in town who predicted the storm is out doing on-the-spot weather feeds for Channel 6 while trying to win a ratings battle with his vacuous-but-charismatic rival. (Unanswered question how does Tom manage to get to work when Laura is snowed in?) The oldest son Hal (Mark Webber) pursues Claire (Emmanuelle Chriqui) the most unattainable girl in school while remaining oblivious to the romantic feelings harbored for him by his best friend tomboy Lane (Schuyler Fisk). And Natalie (Zena Grey) conspires with her friends to highjack the snowplow driven by the dreaded Snow Plow Man (Chris Elliott) and bring a mythical second consecutive snow day to Syracuse. Of the four distinct plots laid out over the course of Snow Day the ones with the kids are the most enjoyable. Hals romance although entirely by-the-numbers works to a limited degree because the characters (and the actors playing them) are appealing. Likewise the fantasy elements associated with Natalies quest to stop Snow Plow Man give those sequences a certain entertainment value. On the other hand I found the mother/toddler bonding scenes to be lackluster although not as tedious as Chevy Chases screen appearances. Chase is a comedian who hasnt done anything vaguely amusing in over a decade but still thinks his every move will cause uncontrollable fits of laughter. If he gets a chuckle from a lone member of the audience during the course of this movie hes lucky. The only time that Snow Day approaches a level of inventiveness is during the Natalie/Snow Plow Man battles. Elliott plays the films villain as an unfriendly antisocial party pooper with bad teeth and a pet crow. Hes the kind of guy who will plow in a driveway just to force someone to dig out. (Then again dont all snow plows do that?) And for Natalie he represents malevolence personified because his clearing of the streets is the reason the kids only get one day off. This year with a little help from her friends and some inspiration from a cartoon fantasy action hero shes determined to end Snow Plow Mans reign of terror. Snow Day appears designed to fill the family film vacancy found inside multiplexes at this time of year. Its one of those movies that doesnt try to please adults as well as kids which can make it a little bit of a trial to sit through for anyone trapped into chaperoning a group of youngsters. The best family films are those that find something to captivate everyone regardless of age. Snow Day neither aspires to nor attains that category.
