I know where theyre coming from. Who wants to have to sit up all night because someone saw The Wizard of Oz before she was ready? Who wants to have that argument with a spouse who told you 60 times The Birds was a bad idea? But theres often no good answer for that question. You might as well pick up a shirt off the rack at Gymboree and ask me if that will fit your daughter. With all due respect How would I know? Youll just have to take it home and hope for the best. In my experience different films and television shows freak out different children differently. Most standards of appropriateness are a joke I found Jim Henson movies scary. Ask concerned parents what they watched when they were kids and when did they watch it. Thats a more useful bar. The experience of fear is an important cultural rite. The dread that knots your stomach is an amazing feeling that as an adult you neither forget nor top. Mommie Dearest was the first movie that completely scared me. Brian De Palmas Carrie was the second. I was too young for both which means I was the perfect age. Parental betrayal fuels the great horror tales -- even the camp ones. The horrors of Mommie Dearest lasted long enough to find them laughable. They could be conquered through performance and quoted at recess. Carrie was less theatrical. It used cinema to cast its pall. One night I found it on television and watched the whole thing. Watched the whole thing appalled. At 8 all you know is what you see buckets of blood hurtling knives an imploding house. But the movie also proffers for your nightmares greater horrors shots of a hideous-looking crucified Jesus a hand shooting from a grave the heart-attack sound cues that eerie Vaseline glow Sissy Spacek. That last one sounds mean. But it gives the film half its power. Spacek had cartoon-big eyes and jungle-cat freckles. Her hair was limp straw. Her smile sagged. Her Southern accent was soft and beguiling. No one I knew said ""mama"" with such sadness disappointment and ambivalence. Id seen The Wizard of Oz at least five times by then. I knew This girl would have made an amazing Scarecrow. But instead of Oz she was in a kind of zoo. Life at home with her crazy mother (Piper Laurie) was hell. So was life at school among a chorus of bullies. Yet she was treated as if she were velvet. She looked like she was scared of everything including herself -- her body her feelings her telekinetic powers. You knew why not even her mother liked her She gave everybody the creeps. De Palmas style gave the movie the rest of its strength. The camera floated. It swung. It swerved. It jumped from long shots to close-ups. Behavior as banal as group laughter was rendered in motion so slow that it was like watching something be born and die at the same time. Carrie of course was alive and the terror in all that energy was exhilarating. An 8-year-old couldnt have known the source of that slowed-down sped-up moviemaking was Brian De Palma. OK the movie was based on Stephen Kings first published novel which was adapted by Lawrence D. Cohen. But the delivery mechanism for its scariness comes from a director with distinct purely visual sensibility. As a movie it lingers and looms. Carrie is so distinctively a De Palma movie that surely most people who see it think afterward of him before thinking of King. (Theyre coauthors now.) How do you make an audience forget the original film? Either you hope your audience sees no films (thats how you wind up with 1988s Carrie the musical) or you hope it wasnt around in 1976 to see De Palmas movie. Thats how you wind up with the remake that opens today. Carrie 2013 gets into territory that feels modern. Its still set in a suburban town ruled by beautiful people. But when this Carrie (Chloe Grace Moretz) has her period and freaks out after phys-ed and the other girls pelt her with tampons as she pleads for help its like an episode from Emily Bazelons recent book on bullying. One girl Chris (Portia Doubleday) whips out her phone makes a video and posts it online. Thats one source of the remakes horror mortification. Revenge is another. The taunting gets Chris banned from the prom another mortifying punishment. To get her back she her boyfriend (Alex Russell) and their friends decide to ruin Carries night which is possible only because a guilt-stricken classmate Sue (Gabriella Wilde) renounces bullying and loans Carrie her boyfriend (Ansel Elgort). The result is what most people going to this movie will want to see Carries telekinetic retribution. Its the one sequence of the movie thats worthy of De Palma and King. The director Kimberly Peirce treats it like the catastrophe it is. Part of the improvement is a matter of better effects. Carrie can raise her arm and send a hundred bodies flying across an auditorium. She flings people into glass and electrocutes them. This goes on for what feels like a long time. For most of it Peirce keeps the character conducting the mayhem from the stage covered in blood her eyes wild with a kind of arousal. Thats the big difference between the first movie and this one Now Carrie gesticulates her rage. She leans forward and bends back. Shes Celine Dion wailing in Vegas. Shes Gustavo Dudamel snake-charming the L.A. Philharmonic. Shes a mutant in the X-Men offshoot of your choice. This Carrie isnt just striking back shes performing. Peirce even has her float up and sail above her victims. Her power display produces a scene of spectacular destruction. And in addition to all else that sequence evokes youre free to associate it with modern terrors. Youre free to think about the spate of massacres that were less common in 1976. Carrie is victim first and her revenge ought to feel good. But Peirce complicates the exhilaration. She glorifies her heroine without overdoing the slaughter. Its as if she has anticipated the evocation of various shootings and in showing all the people whom Carrie doesnt kill spares her from seeming like the dangerous young men in the news. But that makes for an interesting movie as opposed to one that frightens you. The film cant maintain its strong disturbing opening. ""What is this cancer?"" moans Carries mother Margaret White (Julianne Moore) writhing on the bed while the camera fixes on the sight of something wriggling out from under her nightgown. That introduction is Gothic and lyrical and trashy and even though Moore doesnt tear up the movie the way Piper Laurie did (Laurie didnt seem to know her character had no powers) she gives the role what it needs deranged fever. Margaret tortures the adolescent Carrie with her paranoid evangelism and the adolescent tortures her with her telekinesis and need for friendship and normalcy. It occurs to me that Lee Danielss Precious was actually based on a novel by Stephen King -- halfway at least. But this movie has a tougher time connecting what goes on in the White household with what goes on at Carries school. You watch this movie involving as it is with the sinking feeling that De Palmas Carrie would never happen in 2013. You can tell because for one thing Carrie doesnt look like Sissy Spacek. She looks like Moretz a pert fit blonde. Moretz is still a teenager but she might be the wrong teen for this part. With Moore she can do needy and reluctantly spiteful. Shes actually pretty good. Yet what youre missing is the hook for the bullying the reason. (Lindsay Lohan was rumored to be Kings choice for a remake he reportedly found redundant.) With Spacek it was obvious. She had a secret beauty that stuck out against all the mocking confidence and hotness. (Nancy Allen Amy Irving William Katt and John Travolta played the other kids.) Spacek was instant weirdo while Moretz easily could have played one of Carries assailants. If De Palmas Carrie is at all funny now its because the actors seem older than their parts. Theyre reliving youth. For a kid seeing adults act like adolescents must have added to the scariness High school will never be over. De Palma made his movie seem like a gauzy bad dream reaching out to pull you in. Thats what terrifies a child -- that a movie is coming for you. Peirce isnt that kind of visual artist. Her movies include Boys Dont Cry and Stop-Loss and you can feel her caught in the awkward position of wanting to challenge the material to open it up further rather than furnishing the film with as much vaginal imagery as she does. You can also sense her not wanting to alienate the audience or the studio. Some of what happens here is accessorized with the possessed-mommy horror that has been big at the box office this year. But with Moore the possession feels entirely psychological. Peirce wants to make a hit and even with source material this strange it feels as though she has. But if so thats all she has made. Theres another sort of horror the sort thats all too real. On May 13 1985 the city of Philadelphia dropped a bomb on the roof of 6221 Osage Avenue in West Philadelphia. Its stated goal was to flush out the residents members of a prickly black liberation group called MOVE. The explosion caused a fire that was permitted to grow into an inferno that destroyed 60 additional homes and killed 11 men women and children. (The city urged the evacuation of the surrounding homes in eerie anticipation of the days events.) Local news followed the police standoff the helicoptering in of the bomb the conflagration and the bittersweet conclusion many many hours later. A year after seeing Carrie I watched the MOVE disaster on television from my school all day in a state of bewildered fascination. My grandmother lived five blocks away from the building. A searing new documentary by Jason Osder called Let the Fire Burn opening this week in select cities recalls the event with sharp dismay. It is composed primarily of old footage a news feature on Philadelphias Channel 6 (the ABC affiliate) about the MOVE organization video from previous confrontations between the group and the police news reports from the scene of the standoff home-video images and the deposition of little Michael Moses Ward who died last month. In a little more than an hour and a half Osder lays out the fundamental conflicts -- between both the organization and the police and the organization and its black neighbors. MOVE viewed itself as a religion and you can see why people called the outfit a cult. Its members followed the teaching of a man who named himself John Africa. Everyone in his small mostly black flock took the surname Africa and lived in arguable squalor. They said they wanted to abolish the boundaries of race and class. They were loosely vegan and defended the rights of animals. They harbored distrust of authority. They kept their dreadlocks short and unruly. (My grandmothers friend Irma called them Raggedy Africa.) The police kept its eye on them. In a decade MOVE members were arrested almost 200 times and nine of them were imprisoned after a 1978 police standoff. The police assaulted Delbert Africa when he emerged unarmed from a house. Officer James Ramp died after a MOVE shootout. Something was ripe to happen and the move to Osage Avenue appeared to be it. The neighbors were forced to file complaints. The rest is grim history. The films eloquent structure lets every side speak (two affronted former MOVE members the police and fire commissioners city councilmen) and lets you see that the police used poor judgement and excessive force. But that you-are-there style gives you only an impressionistic sense of what life was like inside that organization. Youd like to hear from Michael Moses Ward now. Youd like some present-day recall. This is a rigorously passive feat of journalism. In that absence of clarification a kind of mystery grows about whether MOVE was a truth-to-power group a terrorist organization or just a nightmarish neighborhood nuisance. It really depends on whom you ask. Even so this is a stunning film that gets at that primal need to experience fear. Its scary as both a movie and a still-reverberating moment in time.

Teenage girls can still be pure evil. And now they come with iPhones. So that plug it up tampon scene - when Carrie gets her first period - ends up on YouTube in this remake starring Chloe Moretz and Julianne Moore as her God-bothering mum. As remakes go it isnt as lame as it could be. Director Kimberly Peirce (who made Boys Dont Cry another film about an outcast trapped by smalltown bullies) gets inside the psychology of her characters more than Brian De Palma did in 1976. But her Carrie is no match for the spooks and shocks of the original - which still gives The Shining a run for its money as the best film of a Stephen King novel. Moretz is unnervingly talented but Carrie is not a role she was born to play. She hasnt a victims bone in her body and fluffs the early scenes when the mean girls pick on her. Moretzs Carrie comes into her own when she wreaks havoc at the prom and in the afterparty rampage scene. Its only in the final 20 minutes after the pigs blood scene (nothing new there) that Carrie grabs you by the throat with a fireworks display of Carries telekinetic freakouts. Too little a little too late.

Only a few superficial changes - mainly brief scenes of Carrie researching and learning to control her newfound power - save this film from being a scene for scene remake of De Palmas version. Pierce even rehashes De Palmas ending which is nothing like Kings. Moretz and Moore are both prodigiously talented and both do their best but have little to work with here. The rest of the cast with the exception of Judy Greer is instantly forgettable. Pierces Carrie is a mediocre effort that doesnt really do justice to its source material but so in my humble but honest opinion was the original. Despite its iconic status among horror fans De Palmas Carrie like Pierces is a superficial telling of the tale that fails to capture the atmosphere of the novel.

"Carrie - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Carrie Posted by Christy Lemire on October 22 2013 5 Comments Sony Screen Gems Rated R for bloody violence disturbing images language and some sexual content. Running time 99 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four. Dont call it a remake. Kimberly Peirces version of ""Carrie"" dubs itself as a ""reimagining"" of the high-school horror classic. Certainly the director of ""Boys Dont Cry"" would seem an inspired intriguing choice to bring this famous story of a frightened (and frightening) bullied girl to a whole new generation. But beat for beat and moment for moment Peirces ""Carrie"" remains safely faithful to the narrative and the images that Brian DePalma so indelibly etched in our minds when he adapted Stephen Kings novel in 1976. Working from a script by Robert Aguirre-Sacasa (although original ""Carrie"" screenwriter Lawrence D. Cohen tellingly shares credit) Peirce stages all the key scenes vividly and efficiently the gym shower humiliation the claustrophobia of the prayer closet the unlikely prom date the bucket of pigs blood and ultimately the unleashing of Carries fearsome telekinetic powers. If this were the only ""Carrie"" that ever existed we probably would all view it as a sturdy and startling example of the genre. But comparisons are inevitable especially given the stature the original ""Carrie"" retains within pop culture. There was something shockingly raw about DePalmas direction; the performances and the very presence of Sissy Spacek as the skittish title character and Piper Laurie as her smothering mother seemed almost animalistic in their purity. Chloe Grace Moretz meanwhile internalizes her anxiety early on but then wholeheartedly embraces the full force of her new-found abilities in the films wildly bloody crescendo. (After all Moretz did make her name as the petite and potent Hit Girl in the ""Kick-Ass"" movies; here she turns the films climax into something resembling performance art.) And Julianne Moore seems more ethereally creepy whereas Laurie was downright demonic in her rage. Again these are both hugely talented and versatile actresses whose work wed all probably be completely satisfied with if a practically identical film hadnt already moved us nearly four decades earlier. Peirce one of the most prominent queer directors working in film today (and the recent recipient of Outfests Achievement Award) theoretically would bring a unique insight a personal perspective to this well-known tale of an abused damaged teenager who finds her strength and exacts her revenge on the popular kids who ostracized her. And she does offer the same sort of heartbreaking nugget at the core of ""Carrie"" the one that makes the story unsettling in its sadness and not just in its frights. Carrie White (Moretz) whos been taught to doubt and hate herself by her doom-and-gloom religious-zealot mom (Moore) is far more of a fragile wounded creature than the average awkward teen. As if adolescence werent difficult enough Carrie fears the wrath of God at every turn at the violent urging of her cruel mother. (The films opening scene in which Margaret White gives birth to Carrie alone in her bedroom and then immediately tries to stab the newborn in the face with a pair of scissors is deeply chilling to watch whether youre a parent or not.) The fact that Carrie finally reaches a place where she feels comfortable opening up and enjoying her youth and femininity -- only to be humiliated sadistically by the same classmates to whom she dared make herself vulnerable -- is and always has been the most powerful part of ""Carrie."" The hurt she experiences is far more devastating than the pain she inflicts on her peers in retribution. Peirce definitely grasps that the place of loneliness from which Carries anger springs. Hunched over in the back of the classroom uncomfortable showering with the mean girls -- led by Gabriella Wilde as the pretty popular Sue Snell and an awesomely wicked Portia Doubleday as the rich shit-stirrer Chris Hargensen -- Carrie simply wants to disappear. The combination of discovering her telekinetic powers and receiving an invitation to the prom from superstar jock Tommy Ross (Ansel Elgort) inspires her to emerge from her shell slowly but surely. Judy Greer brings some much-needed dry wit to the role of Ms. Desjardin the schools P.E. teacher and the de facto parental figure who provides Carrie with encouragement. The fact that we know that her tentative happiness will come crashing down all around her -- literally -- doesnt make it any less agonizing to watch. It is a timeless thing for all of us the ritual of high-school expectation and heartache. Once again as it did nearly 40 years ago ""Carrie"" turns it into an experience of biblical proportions. Tweet Category Reviews Tags Chloe Grace Moretz Julianne Moore Kimberly Peirce Piper Laurie Sissy Spacek Stephen King 5 Comments on ""Carrie"" October 22 2013  by  JozieLee     As I read your review Christy I was reminded of how relevant ""Carrie"" is today because of the school shooting in Sparks School Nevada. A bullied 12-year-old wounded 2 fellow students killed his math teacher then turned the gun on himself. The original ""Carrie"" was made almost 40 years ago. The story is essentially the same which means bullying isnt a new problem. Every generation experiences the pain of ridicule and ostracism. Bullying is almost part of human DNA. For me thats the message of this retelling. Bullying is part of growing up. It matters that we take it seriously. Instead of ignoring or belittling its effects maybe we need to give our kids tools . . . not guns . . . to face it when they see it. Instead of surrounding the victim after he/shes dead or jailed maybe society needs to surround and protect the victim when its happening. How often do we see one person standing alone then watch the crowd step away leaving them alone and vulnerable. Todays generation would never reach back into the vault to retrieve the original movie. They have no connection with Sissy Spacek or Piper Laurie. But they do connect with Chloe Grace Moretz. In your WTF review you noted the new ""Carrie"" includes social media texting the internet. Major relevance to todays audience. However does technology add to or solve Carries problem? I suspect the internet intensifies her pain because her taunters have increased access to her. ""Carrie"" may not offer solutions and the story will always end the same but maybe awareness . . . that bullying is not unique . . . could stop the next school shooting or suicide. Reply October 23 2013  by  Aaron Lewis     Christy I understand how it is nearly impossible for us to erase something as iconic as De Palmas horror classic from our minds before watching Pierces version. Even though this is a near impossible thing to do I think it is necessary. Just as I believe books-to-film do not need to be compared with one another I dont think it is right to compare ""remakes"" to one another either. I struggled with this when I watched The Amazing Spider-Man. I thought it was fresh fun and original but any originality or freshness it brought to the table was lost because of how recent of a new adaptation it was. I dont think its a fair question to ask ""Is it better than the original?"" I think that does both De Palmas and Pierces film a disservice. I particularly liked Pierces feminist perspective and the lens in which she wanted to view her characters. A lot was fascinating and much of this version works for me. At the same time much doesnt work. I felt like since they ""modernized"" the story and this included the modernizing of the bullying (cyber-bullying) the modern punishments for that kind of bullying didnt match up. I know our schools have a problem with this. I just found it incredibly false that the girls in gym class didnt suffer some harsher punishment than they did. Maybe thats an issue to take up with King. What I loved about Ebert was how he taught us to be optimistic and open-minded when watching movies. I think too many critics went into this with the desire to compare and not the desire to observe and understand Pierces Carrie. Im not saying you did that. Im just expressing my feelings towards this film. I like what you said a lot. Im just a college student who writes reviews for fun...like seriously. Im such a nerd. You should check out my measly review of Carrie. Heres the link http//aaronreviews.weebly.com/1/post/2013/10/carrie.html Reply Pingback Carrie gets spooked...twice | Warning No Spoilers November 2 2013  by  Russell Dee     Lots of people are saying there was no reason to make this movie because the original suffices but when I watch a movie like this I try to pretend the original doesnt exist and ponder if the new version would have been a big hit if not for the fact that there is a beloved original. I didnt really like the original Carrie but I like this remake. The acting was great the story was fine and everything came together just right. This movie would have been a bigger hit if the original did not exist and the original is nowhere near as good as this movie. This movie does everything right. Reply July 9 2014  by  Normandy     Unfortunately as most attest Chloe was miscast. She isnt a victim. She is too pretty. It seems that she is losing her acting ability as she ages. I fear she peaked in Kick Ass... Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Its unfortunate because the movie is very good both as a first-order viewing experience and as a contemporary gloss on Brian De Palmas classic 1976 adaptation of Stephen Kings novel. Peirces version is good-with-an-asterisk as are ""Boys Dont Cry"" and her second feature ""Stop-Loss."" She creates a closed-in world of characters whose tendrils intertwine in emotionally complex ways; shes a filmmaker of community and family--of bonds their pathologies and their violent breaking. She has themes concerns tones and moods but doesnt have a distinctive cinematic imagination for it; her symbolic realm is naturalistic not pictorial. Peirce does bring thoughtful and engaging twists on De Palmas version--not least in the simple yet obvious integration of social media into the story (an iPhone video of Carries shower-room freakout is a humiliating natural for Facebook). More important is a short and violent bit of backstory that sets up both the primordial source of Carries telekinetic powers and a quiet sting of an ending that reprises the opening. The suggestion is that Carries abilities may not be a freakish miracle but a replicable event--in effect a metaphysical result of a social problem. Unlike De Palma Peirce is no Hitchcockian where De Palma builds an element of guilt and consequence into Carries deadly outburst Peirce expressly removes it. As she strips out the erotic frisson from the prom dance she also strips out the sublime one-take choreography the exquisite exchanges of glances--and happily the presumptuous and irritating music cues from ""Psycho"" that De Palma fills the movie with. (For that matter the town in which its set is no longer called Bates as it is in De Palmas film.) Peirce intelligently and gleefully makes much more of telekinesis than De Palma did. Carrie tests her skills more often and more vigorously than in the original and puts them to even more horrifically and thrillingly destructive uses in the apocalyptic climax. The director takes the practicality of these powers a little more seriously than De Palma does and the energized action sequences that result have an empathetic basis. For Peirce Carrie is more than a symbol more than a suffering cipher and her identity seems denser her intelligence surer her sensibility more nuanced than in the earlier film--therefore her telekinetic powers are more of a surprise to her and her discovery of them has the feel of a strange and ambiguous awakening. The largest and most important shift is a tonal one which results not from the drama but from Peirces approach to it for all the agony of dogma and bullying the film is imbued with a surprising sweetness to set off the cruelty. Peirces non-Manichean view of high-school society reflects her nuanced conception of group life and also reflects the times--our era is one of heightened conscience to go along with the heightened vulnerability of private lives made public online. The dramatic effect is to render both the bullying that launches the plot and the violence that resolves it all the more shocking. The sympathetic warmth that underlies the jangling violence is the movies most original and engaging quality. If only Peirces shots had the resonance and the intricacy of her world view--she conjures the spaces between characters with her script even with the acting but not with the images. Peirce is a filmmaker who thinks the world who imagines the world but who doesnt seem to see it--and thats what hollows out the experience of her ""Carrie"" renders the viewing slack and sluggish in between the brief but formidably propulsive jolts of action. Yet even though the images are often bland the movies sense of natural symbol leaves an enduring and complex aftertaste. One of the things that Carrie does with her telekinetic powers is to express her displeasure with people by suspending them in the air just above the ground. Their dangling feet toes pointed downward and straining to touch down were the first giveaway. I had just seen another movie also opening today in which a shot of feet dangling just above the ground and getting a bare toehold of support is both horrific to observe and crucial to the plot--""12 Years a Slave."" Although Steve McQueens movie renders historical crimes in their horrific intimacy while ""Carrie"" deals with relatively trivial adolescent pranks these cognate images suggest that the connections between them are non-trivial and go surprisingly far. The teen-ager is a recent creation resulting from the rise of mandatory universal education and laws regarding truancy which exert control over the students body even as the enforced discipline of gym class (one of the crucial scenes in ""Carrie"") entails the threat of physical punishment. For every grateful and enthusiastic student theres one (or more) whos marking time as if school days were a sentence. These pseudo-oppressed youths took up the music of Americas authentically oppressed group blacks--hence rock and roll. High-school movies such as ""Carrie"" tell stories of force and authority--governmental academic parental--and the fundamental trope of these stories is liberation. In Carries case school ought to have been a liberation in itself by contrast with the repressive religious practice imposed on her by her mother. But when the forces of order dictate civility and comity the anarchy of cruelty is experienced as an act of self-liberation (as in the racism implicit in antebellum nostalgia for the ""rebel"" South). Like her mothers religion Carries violence comes off not as evil but as virtue gone mad. De Palmas ""Carrie"" is a forebear of ""Django Unchained""; Peirces ""Carrie"" isnt as daring or as significant as ""12 Years a Slave"" but it tells a familiar story with new sympathies and taps a vein of Americana that--perhaps to Peirces surprise but doubtless not to McQueens--turns out also to be inextricable from Africana.

"Carrie (2013) | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; carrie-2013 ) Carrie (2013) (United States 2013) October 18 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Welcome to ""Spoilerville."" Brian De Palmas 1976 adaptation of Stephen Kings Carrie trod a precarious line between exploitative horror and serious social commentary. On the one hand the movie represented the ultimate revenge fantasy for bullied and abused children a way to strike back lethally at those who torment and marginalize them. On the other hand by not dwelling on the carnage it asked questions about the role society plays when one of its own snaps and turns into a twisted killing machine. There are problems with De Palmas version especially in its portrayal of the key relationship between Carrie and her mother but its a more engaging and insightful portrayal than Kimberly Peirces too-slick remake. Rather than fixing some of the problems with De Palmas approach and trying something fresh Peirce compounds them. Especially in the wake of a made-for-TV iteration and a retread sequel this defines ""unnecessary."" For those unaware of the trajectory of the narrative it tells of the events leading up to a catastrophic prom night for the seniors at Ewen High a public school in Maine. The title character Carrie White (Chloe Grace Moretz) is about as shy and withdrawn as a girl can be. She has no friends and when she experiences her first menstrual period after gym class and believes shes bleeding to death she earns the derision of the girls who witness her panic attack in the locker room. Her most ardent detractor is the cruel Queen Bee Chris Hargensen (Portia Doubleday). Another girl Sue Snell (Gabriella Wilde) suffers a change of heart in the wake of the incident. In conjunction with a twisted home life where she is dominated by her fanatically religious mother Margaret (Julianne Moore) this event triggers the awakening of strong telekinetic powers within Carrie and as events propel her toward the fateful night she begins to learn how to control them to manipulate items. The biggest loss in the 2013 Carrie is ambiguity. In De Palmas interpretation Carrie is a tragic figure but the films attitude toward her is nebulous. The film doesnt glory in Carries revenge. In fact the death of the antagonist occurs in a brief brutal burst that denies the audience the momentary satisfaction that can result from a sustained confrontation. Peirce working from a screenplay co-credited to Lawrence D. Cohen and Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa wants the viewer to identify with Carrie. She spends more time than De Palma making the character sympathetic (including a prologue in which Carries mother nearly murders the newborn with a pair of scissors) and when it comes to the infamous prom sequence she makes us complicit in Carries violence. The demise of the villain that was presented in such a matter-of-fact fashion in the 1976 film is instead depicted in long grotesque detail. Technically Peirces production is superior but considering the increase in budget and advances in special effects during the nearly 40 years since De Palma visited Carries twisted world thats unsurprising. There are also some odd choices in shot selection. The most obvious occurs early in the film during the gym shower scene when Carrie experiences her first period. In the De Palma version this was as uncomfortable a movie moment as a viewer is likely to encounter with a naked and bloody Sissy Spacek pleading for help from her scornful classmates. Peirce out of deference to her stars modesty elides the nudity. Instead we have a panic-stricken girl trying to keep a towel wrapped around her as she freaks out. The scene is oddly filmed and not only is it less effective but it borders on camp. Chloe Grace Moretzs performance is for the most part credible. The young actress who has turned in stand-out work in the likes of Let Me In and Hugo has nothing to be ashamed of here. She presents Carrie as a deeply troubled individual unhealthily attached to her mother and with no self-esteem. Its a fascinating portrayal that is matched by Julianne Moore. As Margaret Moores representation of a soul tortured by a warped theology is infinitely more credible than Piper Lauries over-the-top interpretation in the earlier movie. The supporting actors playing the teens in Carries immediate orbit - Gabriella Wilde as Sue Portia Doubleday as Chris and Ansel Elgort as the dreamy Tommy Ross - are instantly forgettable. Perhaps the biggest thing working against Carrie is that since De Palma tackled this story there has been a marked uptick in school violence. Events like Columbine and Sandy Hill have put a greater weight of responsibility on a director who wants to be taken seriously when working with this kind of narrative. Theres nothing of the sort evident here and because the film glories in Carries orgy of supernatural terror (which at least according to Kings book resulted in greater than 400 deaths including more than 50% of the graduating class) the result feels exploitative and ugly. Carrie isnt much fun but neither does it exist as a serious piece of filmmaking. Its just another inferior remake.

Raised by a Christian fundamentalist single mother played by Piper Laurie Carries initiation into womanhood and sexuality turns into a literal bloodbath on prom night.Peirce doesnt have DePalmas dirty-minded adolescent temperament or his voluptuous sense of dread. Her film starring Chloe Grace Moretz as Carrie and Julianne Moore as her mother is more straightforward in its shocks. Although bullying in schools is a more pronounced issue now than it was back in the 70s DePalmas film certainly didnt play down its ""Mean Girls"" aspect. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time By focusing on Carries rabid desire for vengeance in the wake of the prom Peirce has made a girl-power version of the King material. But the finale is truncated and the final image is a tired frisson promising a sequel. Peirce is gifted but she lacks the ability of directors like DePalma to transform schlock into something deeply personal.

(I could go on and on about Amy Irving Nancy Allen darling P.J. Soles John Travolta etc.) Above all its a movie that takes no prisoners. The well-meaning die as gruesomely as the malevolent. The one character left alive is probably too damaged to recover. As much of a hot dog as De Palma is (few directors are as gleefully virtuosic) he rarely takes off into a solipsistic sphere Every trick both delights him and heightens his characters emotions. I wont pretend I wasnt incensed when I heard about a Carrie remake in the works but I went in with an open mind and heart. The director Kimberly Peirce could in theory provide the one thing De Palma couldnt -- a female gaze -- and the ideas she explored in Boys Dont Cry about gender and female self-image made it likely shed at least bring something new to the party. Based on the finished movie though Im wondering if she had any say in what finally hit the screen. The new Carrie isnt atrocious -- just flat and uninspired and compromised by the kind of mindless teen-movie ""humanism"" that De Palma so punkishly spat on. (Its atrocious by comparison.) A TV hack from Glee came in to cross the ts and dot the is in Lawrence D. Cohens original screenplay (based on Stephen Kings novel). He makes Carries religious wackadoodle mom (Julianne Moore) a self-cutter and he has the girls who jeer and throw tampons at Carrie in the girls locker room take video of her cowering sobbing form and post it online. (But -- implausibly -- theres no fallout from this.) The rest of his work consists of having Carrie (Chloe Grace Moretz) distinguish between the mean girls whove taunted her and those whove tried to help her. She lets the former go and serves up protracted vigilante justice (probably more satisfying to bloodthirsty modern audiences) to the bad-uns. Whats lost is the primal inexplicable truly demonic power. As the stunted Carrie Moretz has a heart-shaped face -- shes all cheekbones and pillowy lips and is more conventionally attractive than the pale freckled otherworldly Spacek. A higher percentage of the target demographic will relate to her better. To convey Carries alienation Moretz hunches her shoulders and tilts her head down so that her hair hangs in her face. Shes like Ally Sheedy from The Breakfast Club in desperate need of a scholarship to Professor Xaviers school for mutants. The most haunting thing about Carries powers in the original -- that they erupt from her as a consequence of trauma plus adolescent hormones that theyre more unconscious than not -- has been domesticated. Now she plays around with controlling her telekinesis orchestrating objects and conducting the climactic destruction number as if its a Mahler symphony. Her pleas to her mother have nowhere near enough urgency They dont come from the depths of a soul in torment but a conventional sad adolescent in need of a bestie and a hairdresser. Moore meanwhile makes Margaret White a more realistic -- and tedious -- sniveler. The characters riotous punch line -- that she has her first orgasm as shes crucified -- has no place in so dull a conception. I imagine kids will line up for Carrie though -- it panders to their sense of entitlement and it ends with a tidy anti-bullying message. (Theres no female pubic hair on display either as in the original which means no cluck-clucks from the bluestockings.) Maybe the Glee generation will even prefer this version. But no one who loves De Palmas landmark will be able to endure it. And Kimberly Peirce should hang her head in shame.

Trying to squeeze a couple of more dollars out of the property isnt one of them. So why cant folks let ""Carrie"" rest in peace? Since Brian De Palmas 1976 adaptation Stephen Kings telekinetic heroine has appeared in a sequel a TV remake and a legendarily horrific Broadway musical. Why dig her up again? Still I had some hopes going in. Kimberly Peirce is a talented director who made the great ""Boys Dont Cry"" and the sadly ignored ""Stop-Loss."" She seemed likely to give the film a more feminist touch. The new Carrie meanwhile was the talented Chloe Grace Moretz who was at least the right age for the part. And Julianne Moore had signed on to play her fervently religious sexually twisted mother. It seemed as if there might be more at work here than someone trying to sell more tickets to something wed already seen. But although Peirce does add a few references to cyberbullying -- and her camera doesnt prowl the girls showers as creepily as De Palmas did -- theres nothing particularly new or stylish here. A couple of sweet shots of the kids getting prom-ready and some sleek special effects dont exactly constitute an original vision. Nor does Moretz fit the role. Yes Sissy Spacek was technically too old in the first film but she had an ageless spooky quality; she seemed to be listening to things you couldnt hear. What this film really needed was someone like Saoirse Ronan (but not Saoirse Ronan -- shes done far too many parts like this as it is.) Moretz though is too clearly acting rather than feeling; she hunches her shoulders and looks at the floor but theres nothing in her quiet moments that makes you believe this is a traumatized oddball outcast -- or one capable of bloody revenge. Much better is Julianne Moore who completely fully commits -- talking in a self-effacing mumble jabbing herself with a seam ripper and yes warning her daughter about letting boys see her ""dirty pillows."" Wild as Piper Laurie was in the first ""Carrie"" Moores more contained more realistic -- and therefore more frightening. The film isnt unwatchable. The Bad Girls are cliched Bad Girls (and the actor playing the Indulgent Dad is terrible) but the always-terrific Judy Greer makes a good sympathetic gym teacher. And anyone whos ever had a bad school day -- which means everyone -- will guiltily identify with Carries ultimate incendiary justice. But in the end this is nothing but a fancy bit of corporate Hollywood graverobbing -- slipping into the copyright cemetery digging up a generous loved one and calmly stripping her of every bit of gold and silver they can pawn.

"Carrie (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Carrie (R) Kimberly Peirces new adaptation of the classic Stephen King novel is a grave but listless thriller. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com10/17/2013 Editor rating 2 When Brian De Palma adapted Stephen Kings novel Carrie for film in 1976 he turned the simple story of a bullied teenage girl with telekinetic powers into a dreamy pop-horror fantasia -- a lush operatic fright show that grooved on its excesses. De Palma threw everything into the movie split screens; slow motion; cartoonish humor; shameless sentimentality; a merciless sense of justice. The film made you laugh as much as it scared you. Often it did both at the same time. De Palmas Carrie became so iconic that it remains fresh and vital 37 years later -- practically an eternity in Hollywood time -- and casts an imposing shadow over the new version by director Kimberly Peirce (Boys Dont Cry Stop-Loss). Instead of trying to outdo the grandness of the original Peirce takes a more grounded approach treating the characters of Carrie White (Chloe Grace Moretz) and her religious-fanatic mother Margaret (Julianne Moore) with more emotional gravity and empathy. Although the beautiful Moretz looks nothing like the ""chunky girl with pimples on her neck and back and buttocks"" King described in his book the actress invests the character with a fragile vulnerability that runs deeper than her unkempt hair and shabby clothes. She looks like she wishes she could shrink away into herself and disappear. When she gets her first period while taking a shower at school after P.E. class she howls with terror and panic -- she doesnt understand whats happening to her -- and the other girls in the locker room descend on her like a mob mocking and taunting and taking delight in her hysteria. But menstruation also awakens something in Carrie -- the ability to move objects with her mind. The power emboldens the timid girl even though she must keep it hidden from her mom who would undoubtedly consider telekinesis the devils work. Moore plays Carries monstrous mama as a tragic figure a sheltered and awkward woman who is as confused and befuddled as her daughter. Margaret is constantly cutting and scratching herself -- flagellation as a form of worship -- and although her parenting skills are misguided to the point of abuse Moore makes us understand why she does the things she does. The world betrayed her and shes not going to let the same thing happen to Carrie. She will fail of course in a most spectacular fashion. Carrie is going to suffer and thats where the movie starts running into problems. Peirce is good at illustrating the complexities and contradictions inherent in all her characters The repentant Sue (Gabriella Wilde) who feels bad about having participated in the locker room debacle and asks her boyfriend (Ansel Elgort) to take Carrie to the prom; the mean girl Chris (Portia Doubleday) who plots bloody revenge after being barred from attending the prom; and Coach Desjardin (Judi Greer) the teacher who takes a motherly interest in Carrie. Peirce fares much worse with the horror elements in the film relying too heavily on cheap-looking CGI for ineffective shocks -- she totally flubs the movies Big Moment -- and turning her heroine into a kind of demonic superhero who uses her hands like Magneto to manipulate objects (this Carrie looks like she should have been part of X-Men First Class). The beauty of De Palmas movie is that the crazier the story became the scarier and more unnerving the film got building to an enormous ""Gotcha"" scare in its final scene. This Carrie becomes less involving as it goes along ceding its emotional power to special effects and unconvincing gore and culminating with a closing shot so lame and uninspired its as if the filmmakers just gave up and called it a day.

However among its few changes is an added prologue that sees bastard child Carrie nearly killed at birth by an ashamed Margaret White (Julianne Moore). Margaret spares her life though and as we work our way to a familiar grave its firmly established that the eponymous telekinetic teen was damned since the day she was born. We then join Carrie (Chloe Grace Moretz) as she meekly endures her senior year of high school making a scene in the gym showers when her panicked response to her first period earns the mockery of peers now armed with camera phones. One classmate Sue (Gabriella Wilde) regrets her part in the matter and insists that hunky boyfriend Tommy (Ansel Elgort) take Carrie to prom instead while another Chris (Portia Doubleday) resents gym teacher Ms. Desjardin (Judy Greer) and Carrie by extension for her actions incurring actual administrative consequences. While one plots her redemption another plans her revenge although Carrie wouldnt know it consumed with fending off her mothers domineering ways and testing the limits of her newfound psychic powers. Its fair to assume that anyone reading this knows that these characters are due for a fiery reckoning at and after the big school dance and in keeping with a pronounced emphasis on special effects along the way the third act is orchestrated with a ""Final Destination""-like glee for teen-targeted torment rather than the cathartic blend of madness and sadness that made De Palmas take on the material so iconic. In a misguided bid for modern appeal everything besides the shower scene has been wrought in a bloodier -- though not necessarily bolder -- fashion. Little of the carnage calls to mind Peirces last two films ""Boys Dont Cry"" and ""Stop-Loss"" (a.k.a. ""Soldier Boys Dont Cry"") and whats more frustrating is that little of what precedes the climax does either. When Carrie is nearly caught playing with her powers in her bedroom its a coy familiar metaphor for pubescent antics skewed by Margarets impulsive need to wield a knife as she makes her way upstairs. Despite Moores relatively internalized zealotry Peirce often treats her as a hallway-haunting boogeyman who emerges from a suggestive mid-door split in a desperate effort to save her daughters soul but who merely mutters scripture to her neighbors rather than thumping Bibles at their very doorstep. Moretz delivers a viably anguished performance as one might have come to expect from the young actress. Though not as supposedly homely as Sissy Spacek seemed to be she navigates the everyday fear tentative promise and eventual fury of the part well. For all the high-flying antics to come Moretz most powerful moment comes when she delivers a withering glance unto her mother while voicing long-dormant concerns about ""not becoming a whole person."" Alas despite the timeless concerns of adolescent bullying and burgeoning sexuality ""Carrie"" as a film fails to become its own satisfyingly whole interpretation of coming-of-age horrors both literal and figurative. Its bloodshed may be all dressed up but it ultimately has nowhere to go.

Grade C Kimberly Peirces remake of Brian De Palmas ""Carrie"" isnt a total fiasco like Gus Van Sants remake of Alfred Hitchcocks ""Psycho"" but its equally gratuitous. It introduces several contemporary elements - smartphones YouTube videos a background of home schooling - and a couple of up-to-date references to Tim Tebow and ""Dancing With the Stars."" Otherwise it mixes and matches master strokes from the classic 1976 horror movie with material De Palma chose not to use from Stephen Kings 1974 book. The result is an ordinary exceptionally gory high-school vengeance thriller mixed with a heavy-handed message movie about the destructive effects of ""in crowd"" conformity and religious zealotry. This director doesnt have a twinkle in her eye - the film has very few laughs - and her dead-on approach makes the suspense elements and the solemn themes equally bludgeoning. How grave is this movie? It starts with the title characters mother Margaret White (Julianne Moore) alone in her house hollering that shes dying when shes actually giving birth to her daughter. (She thought she was carrying a tumor.) Kings book discusses Carries birth but making it the movies prologue both gives the film an unshakable sobriety and takes the edge off Carries own famous primal scene. By the time she reaches high school Carrie has been so cloistered by this crazed fundamentalist mom - Margaret considers all sex mortally sinful - that when she menstruates for the first time she thinks shes fatally wounded. Unfortunately she undergoes this trauma in the shower after gym class. She screams for help from girls who cant comprehend her panic. They make her suffer the worst taunts of her long-bullied life. In his first published novel King creates an archetypal adolescent nightmare about the ultimate outsider and what happens when shes pushed to fury. Kings plot remains compelling because of its warped Cinderella twist. Sue Snell (Gabriella Wilde) a nice girl regrets having pelted Carrie with tampons and sanitary napkins with the other girls in the shower room. She assuages her guilt by pushing her good-guy beau Tommy Ross (Ansel Elgort) to take Carrie to the prom. Chris Hargensen (Portia Doubleday) the baddest of the mean girls plots with her numbskull tough-guy boyfriend Billy (Alex Russell) to sabotage Carries one special night. Sues good deed wont go unpunished. De Palma stylized Kings fiction - exultantly beautifully -- and infused it with his feeling for the giddiness of youth. De Palma staged the menstruation revelation as his opening sequence choreographing the teenage bodies moving through the shower like a languorous comic ballet. And De Palmas cunning editing made Carries first telekinetic power surge - it burst an overhead light bulb - register with a pop inside every viewers head. In Kings book after tragedy strikes Sue Snell pleads for grownups to remember that she and her classmates were kids. De Palma never forgets. From his films sensual beginning to its harrowing end its gleeful artifice keeps audiences open to unexpected humor and emotion. Hes often been seen as a cold director because he takes characters to extremes. But hes passionately committed to moviemaking itself. His love of craft gives his films their seductive sheen and allows you to see surprising sides to their characters. Peirce captured emotions in the raw in ""Boys Dont Cry"" (2000) and she wants to be a magical moviemaker too. But she doesnt carry the horror gene in her directorial DNA. Her terror is punishing not thrilling and her recreations of De Palmas inventions fall flapjack-flat. The quiet interludes lack rhythm and texture. Telling details from the book like Carries mother listening to Tennessee Ernie Ford sing ""Let the Lower Lights Be Burning"" dont resonate in this films thin atmosphere. Whats worse the key casting is way off. Moretz may be the same age as 16-year-old Carrie but she conveys less vulnerability sensitivity and innocence than Sissy Spacek did at 26. She doesnt have the changeling quality the role requires - she looks as pretty at the start as she does in her prom gown. And she suggests an innate strength that makes her seem at the end a self-conscious monster not a young woman possessed. She doesnt match up well with Moore who plays the mother urgently and intelligently as a hysterical ascetic who mortifies her own flesh. (Moore was wise not to compete with Piper Lauries brilliant all-stops-out portrait of the mother as a religion-ravaged sensualist.) As the ""bad"" couple Doubleday and Russell are like refugees from an awful after-school special. (Nancy Allen and John Travolta romped through these parts in the original.) Peirce fares better with her most conventional characters. As the ""good"" couple Wilde expresses a touching confusion and Elgort conjures a throwback gallantry - hes like a 1950s teen idol who can act. (Tommy is now a lacrosse star not a baseball hero.) Judy Greer brings freshness and verve to Carries sympathetic gym teacher. Midway through these actors help Peirce find a mildly entertaining groove. But the climactic action is a shambles graphic without being really frightening. In the end this ""Carrie"" is not-so-grand Guignol.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A remake of the 1976 horror classic about a bullied girl who gets her revenge. BOTTOM LINE No improvement over Brian De Palmas stylish original merely a surface update. CAST Chloe Grace Moretz Julianne Moore LENGTH 150 Brian De Palmas 1976 horror classic ""Carrie"" which starred Sissy Spacek as a mistreated high school girl who uses her supernatural powers to exact fiery vengeance may look a little dated and campy in hindsight. Its story however adapted from Stephen Kings 1974 novel is as fresh as ever. Pressing such hot-button topics as mean girls bullying and school shootings ""Carrie"" feels not just modern but almost prescient. The time might seem right for a revisit and female director Kimberly Peirce (""Boys Dont Cry"") seems like the right choice. So does Chloe Grace Moretz as Carrie; shes an intriguing young actress with a history of playing violent misfits in ""Let Me In"" ""Dark Shadows"" and the ""Kick-Ass"" franchise. Its also hard to think of a better pick than Julianne Moore (replacing Piper Laurie) as Carries morbidly religious and abusive mother. All three promise great things for a new fresh approach to ""Carrie."" Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Who was the Sons of Anarchy Homeless Woman? Instead ""Carrie"" completely squanders its potential. For the most part the new movie merely imitates the old one sometimes shot for shot and word for word. It makes superficial updates -- modern hair modern clothes a viral video of Carrie being humiliated in the gymnasium shower -- without adding any original spin or thematic embellishment. And aside from Judy Greer as Carries well-meaning gym teacher the movies supporting cast is unmemorable. Portia Doubleday and Alex Russell are no replacements for Nancy Allen and John Travolta as Carries main tormentors. With nothing new to offer ""Carrie"" is reduced to attempting the impossible repeating De Palmas long tense buildup to Carries prom one of the most stylishly executed horror-film sequences in history. Peirce doesnt dare rip off De Palmas famous split screen -- no director would -- so the disappointment is inevitable. Peirce has already made a better version of this story anyway her phenomenal 1999 film ""Boys Dont Cry"" about a small-town transgender girl who learns just how far a herd mentality can go. Its far more effective and far more horrifying than ""Carrie."" 058 MoviesCarrie trailer PLOT A remake of the 1976 horror classic about a bullied girl who gets her revenge. advertisement | advertise on newsday LENGTH 150 BOTTOM LINE No improvement over Brian De Palmas stylish original merely a surface update.

The remake of the 1976 original was filmed in the Toronto area.  (Michael Gibson / Sony Pictures)  By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentThu. Oct. 17 2013CarrieStarring Chloe Grace Moretz Julianne Moore. Directed by Kimberly Peirce. Opening Oct. 18 at major theatres. 99 minutes. 14A.The new Carrie remake is literally a pallid imitation of the original.Comparisons to the 1976 film by Brian De Palma are inevitable -- lets pretend the 2002 TV version never happened -- and by virtually every measure the latest is a kinder gentler version. Thats surely not what the good people at MGM and Screen Gems were aiming for.Article Continued BelowBased on the novel by Stephen King the plot is now familiar territory for expectant audiences. Carrie White a shy awkward teenager has a burgeoning gift telekinesis the ability to move objects with her mind.Unfortunately Carrie also has a fanatically religious mother at home who never bothered to explain certain rites of womanhood including the onset of menstruation.So when Carrie begins bleeding in the gym shower at school and fears the worst she gets the opposite of support from her peers who chant cruelly and pelt her with tampons. In the digital media age her chief tormentor Chris Hargensen records the event on her iPhone for posterity a move shell come to regret.Remorseful classmate Sue Snell persuades her boyfriend Tommy Ross to ask Carrie as his date to the upcoming prom. After Miss Desjardin the sympathetic gym teacher bans Chris from said social event Chris plots revenge with her boyfriend Billy involving a bucket of pigs blood. And when Carrie is humiliated at the prom she wreaks a terrible vengeance on those present.Director Kimberly Peirce (Boys Dont Cry) does make one improvement over the original casting actors who actually look like teenagers rather than young adults well into their college years.And while Sissy Spacek as Carrie and Piper Laurie as her mother both earned Oscar nominations for their performances in the original no one is holding out any hope that history will repeat itself here.Chloe Grace Moretz portrays Carrie with the requisite doe-eyed innocence and awkwardness of adolescence and the stellar Julianne Moore presents us with a compelling portrait of evil -- a tormented self-mutilating woman whose good intentions are so clearly out of step with reality.But the relationship -- so central to the story -- between mother and daughter simply doesnt gel here robbing the film of one of its essential pillars.Ansel Elgort who bears a passable resemblance of hockey superstar Sidney Crosby (only taller) does fine work as doomed golden boy Tommy Ross and Judy Greer is a feisty and compassionate Miss Desjardin. But Gabriella Wilde as good girl Sue Snell is too tentative and easily outshone by Portia Doubleday as Chris her deliciously wicked counterpart.But Peirces biggest misstep is in the climactic scene that everyone is so eagerly anticipating the carnage unleashed by Carries telekinetic fury. Bless DePalmas blood-soaked sensibility he presented a climax -- employing split-screens for greater effect -- that generated waves of cathartic pleasure. By comparison Pierces is restrained in all the wrong ways. Surely the CGI/ VFX capabilities of 2013 compared to the paltry bag of tricks available in the mid-1970s could have been better employed to give the audience spectacle on a grander scale. Even the showdown scene between Carrie and her mother feels disappointing. Only in delivering well-deserved retribution to the evil Chris and Billy does Peirce outshine her predecessor. Carrie 2013 filmed in the Toronto area provides another cautionary lesson to studio decision-makers about the wisdom of remakes. If youre going to do it do it bigger better and -- in the case of horror films -- bloodier. If not dont bother.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    23degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

(Michael Gibson) B- Carrie Genre Horror; Starring Judy Greer Julianne Moore Chloe Grace Moretz; Director Kimberly Peirce; Release Date Wide 10/18/2013; Runtime (in minutes) 92; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Sony Pictures Entertainment Posted October 31 2013 -- 1200 AM EDT Remaking a landmark film ought to be a perfectly respectable proposition. After all we see new versions of Shakespeare or Tennessee Williams all the time (whether on stage or screen). Whats wrong with doing an updated version of a beloved Hollywood movie? In theory nothing yet in practice it seldom works out well. Theres something about how movies with their singularity of mood and density of detail imprint themselves on our imaginations that places the prospect of a remake somewhere between a rock and a hard place. Think about it If you follow the original too closely duplicating signature shots or lines of dialogue or acting flourishes then youre stuck in a mode of mindless imitation -- and whats the point of that? People might as well just watch the great version they already know (or for new generations have yet to discover). But if you seriously update the movie in question making a lot of eyebrow-raising changes then you risk violating the essence of the original -- or leaving out too much of what everyone loved about it in the first place. When you get down to it a ""new"" version of a classic is a contradiction in terms. Carrie the rapturous and terrifying 1976 Brian De Palma thriller based on Stephen Kings first novel is a movie that has earned its place as a quirky horror milestone without perhaps ever having quite attained the status of a masterpiece. Yet I personally think its a great film. Theres nothing that compares to its glittery fusion of dreaminess and dread -- of Cinderella-at-the-prom fantasy and blood-bucket horror all mixed up with elements of ?70s teensploitation comedy and primally entangled mother-daughter tragedy. And what acting Sissy Spacek as the squashed-nerd telekinetic high school wallflower Carrie and Piper Laurie as her ragingly repressed Evangelical mom achieved a tremulous power together. And De Palma a prankish virtuoso perched the whole thing on the knifes edge between sincerity and satire. Carrie is a timeless movie because its both one of the most passionate and most scandalously funny horror films ever made. So what does one do for a remake encore? Kimberly Peirce the gifted director of the new Carrie has gone down what seems on the surface to be a savvy road. She follows De Palmas version quite faithfully evoking everything from his camera angles to his lighting to his flying-object F/X to his gleeful staging of mean-girl antics. At the same time she offers just enough tweaks and updated details to present the material in a new way. The fabled shower-room scene in which the naive sheltered Carrie White (Chloe Grace Moretz) gets her first period and is shocked into thinking that shes dying now has an added fillip of cruelty Chris the most hateful of the girls doesnt just pelt Carrie with tampons and shout ""Plug it up"" She records the whole ordeal on her smartphone and then posts the video. In a neat reversal Chris and her best friend the popular but far more empathetic Sue (who feels so guilty about what happened that she gets her boyfriend to take Carrie to the prom) are both portrayed against type Nice-girl Sue is played by Gabriella Wilde who looks like a vintage snooty princess whereas the awful Chris is made into a pensive bohemian punk by Portia Doubleday. And Carries mother (Julianne Moore) a fundamentalist fanatic who tries to cut Carrie off from the world is now herself a cutter who pinpricks her own flesh in secret. Moore makes her fierce guilt-tripping and scary -- but not in the way that Laurie did almost religiously possessed. Despite being 40 years old now the Carrie story lives quite comfortably in the 21st century. Heres the problem though. The original film had Kings ingenious plot with its fusion of innocence and cruelty and that subliminal wink of demonic takeover but it also had De Palmas voluptuous operatic style which gave the story the quality of a daydream-turned-nightmare. When you take away that style and serve up the plot fairly straight as Peirce does here we seem to be watching a Carrie thats been flattened robbed of its over-the-top emotional extravagance. Given the challenge of revamping Spaceks brilliant shivery-nerd-turned-avenger performance Chloe Grace Moretz does a creditable job. In stiff hair and lumpish clothing shes very much the geek outsider (though today theres a much greater context for geeks as heroines) and the emotions seem to bleed through her ghostly lunar-pale skin. Yet the way Peirce has updated Carrie White without making any overt changes to the character is to portray her as a little less clueless a little less pathetic a little more defiant. Shes now a cute bright painfully shy girl who sees herself (wrongly) as a loser. Before she was a total walking blob of misery and dysfunction. That slight tonal shift robs the story of its masochistic edge. Of course Carrie isnt merely a fable of adolescent agony. Its all about Carries revenge once shes subjected to the most diabolical practical ""joke"" in movie history. Carries telekinetic powers driven by the rage she represses allowed De Palma to orchestrate a senior-prom apocalypse that was pure filmmaking mastery. Peirce stages the prom as a prosaic rerun without a lot of gaudy inspiration. And its here that the real problem with redoing a classic reveals itself. Sure a lot of famous movies are timeless yet theyre also rooted in their time. In the original Carrie Spaceks character seemed to be channeling something creepy and larger-than-life -- maybe it was even the underworld. But now were a lot more accustomed to seeing movie characters mold their destiny through special effects and since Peirce films the climax in a rather depersonalized shoot-the-works way Carrie comes close to seeming like an especially alienated member of the X-Men team. She blows stuff up real good in a way that would make the devil -- or Bruce Willis -- proud. B?

Kimberly Peirce changes almost nothing in her rallying remake of Brian De Palmas classic about a troubled telekinetic teenager. She doesnt have to. Yes now the mean girls who pelt Carrie with tampons upload a cell phone video of the attack and the well-meaning jock who squires the school outcast to prom compares himself to Tim Tebow. But the big difference is the culture around Carrie. In 2013 bullying is the hot-topic high school problem--even Justin Bieber bravely called it ""a terrible thing""--which gives Peirce the empathetic director of Boys Dont Cry the audiences blessing to make Carries anguished vengeance extra gory. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Star Chloe Grace Moretz doesnt have the alien eeriness of young Sissy Spacek who was 26 and married when she played the doomed virgin. A beautiful broad-shouldered blonde whos already slain 80 dudes onscreen in Kick-Ass and Kick-Ass 2 Moretz has to work harder to sell Carries victim status hunching herself in half crossing her elbows tight across her chest and frizzing her hair into a poof. It doesnt quite work so its a relief to see her smile when her gym teacher (Judy Greer) convinces her shed be gorgeous with a little blush. We all know whats coming which makes Moretzs tentative fantasies of acceptance as gutting as the indiscriminate massacre that follows. After the betrayed girl slams shut the gymnasium doors we cant help but think of the elaborate kill lists that school shooters leave behind before they give up and just start spraying everyone.When De Palma shot the original in 1976 the sexual revolution had trickled down to the suburbs. Today a new puritanism is trickling back up with politicians and religious leaders trying to keep a new generation of young women from learning how their bodies work.Film Details Carrie RatingR GenreHorror Running Time92 min. More Info Trailer Sure among her senior class Carries a weirdo but her modest homemade clothes wouldnt be that out of place on an episode of 19 and Counting and her moms moral code would fit right in with the Westboro Baptist Church (who like Julianne Moores character also believe in home-schooling). Which means whats scariest about Carrie in 2013 isnt that this wounded teenage girl has the power to kill--its that there are thousands of girls like her with no power at all.Subscribe to the Voice Film Club podcast2 Chloe Grace Moretz in Carrie.Photo by Michael Gibson.

Photo AP Photo MOVIE REVIEW Carrie Tired blood. Running time 99 minutes. Rated R (bloody violence and ostensibly frightening images). At the E-Walk the Chelsea the Lincoln Square others. Hollywoods ongoing campaign to remake every horror movie of the 1970s and 80s has finally caught up with the Stephen King-Brian De Palma classic ""Carrie and the results are distressingly anemic pig blood and all. Though it follows the original practically scene by scene and has two quite capable actresses -- Chloe Grace Moretz and Julianne Moore -- in the parts that snagged Oscar nominations for Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie youre more likely to snooze than be shocked this time around. I blame director Kimberly Peirce whose vaguely feminist take defangs the cruelty that drove the original and who apparently advised the cast to avoid the sort of borderline-camp performances that made De Palmas film such a treat (and his first big hit). After prefacing the famous opening scene with a prologue in which Margaret White (Moore) contemplates killing newborn daughter Carrie (Moretz) with her sewing scissors Peirce considerably tones down our heroines discovery of menstrual blood and her humiliation at the hands of the cruel girls (none nude this time around) in the locker room. Portia Doubledays Chris is a pale whiny carbon of the gleefully malicious character played in 1976 by Nancy Allen while Gabriella Wilde is far nicer as the chastened Sue than Amy Irving ever was. Ansel Elgort makes his predecessor the not-great William Katt look good as Sues boyfriend Tommy whom she talks into becoming Carries ill-fated prom date. (He compares his charitable act to those of Tim Tebow in one of several half-hearted attempts at updating the story to the 21st century.) And Alex Russell as Chris boyfriend? Lets just say hes no John Travolta. Unlike De Palma Peirce refuses -- or possibly doesnt have the technical skill -- to milk the famous blood-dousing scene at the prom and without the suspenseful buildup it just doesnt have all that much impact. The special effects depicting Carries revenge against her tormentors (and her mom) may be superior to 1976 but nowhere near as much of an improvement as youd expect after 37 years. And her telekinesis is deployed way too frequently early on. The new version of the endlessly imitated final scene? So utterly lame youll want to go out and watch the original on Netflix. Save yourself some time and money and bypass this new ""Carrie altogether.

Photo Michael Gibson Sony Pictures Carrie review less searing than the original 1 / 4 Back to Gallery Carrie Thriller. Starring Chloe Grace Moretz and Julianne Moore. Directed by Kimberly Peirce. (R. 99 minutes.) In a way the new ""Carrie"" is almost too easy to enjoy. Everything discordant and all the nagging weirdness and strange feelings surrounding the original have been smoothed down and what were left with is a well-made highly satisfying and not particularly deep high school revenge movie. Perhaps the difference between this ""Carrie"" and the 1976 version can best be summarized as the difference between Chloe Grace Moretz and Sissy Spacek. Moretz is a teenager playing a teenager a pretty girl who just needs to get away from her crazy mother and shell probably be fine. By contrast Spaceks ""Carrie"" was a social freak damaged almost beyond the reach of therapy and she was played by a 26-year-old actress which made her seem even more weird. There was a feeling in the original of something unanswered something that could not be explained or redressed by any human action and the result is that audiences in 1976 walked out with the creeps. No one will get the creeps from the new ""Carrie."" Instead people will walk to their cars saying ""That was fun"" and not give it another thought - not that thats such a bad thing. The tone is set early to the sound of a womans groaning and a jittery cameras making its way slowly into a house and finally into a room where a woman writhes on bloody sheets in pain. She is praying. She is screaming. She thinks she has some awful disease and that shes about to die but instead she gives birth - to a daughter Carrie meet Mom; Mom meet Carrie. Needless to say Mom is played by Julianne Moore because if youre going to have a scary mommy in a movie why not the best? The opening in which complete sexual ignorance causes horror and distress is paralleled in a scene taking place years later when Carrie (Moretz) showering in the high school locker room notices that she is bleeding and panics. She soon finds out that this is her first period but not before being pelted with tampons by her scornful classmates and having her humiliation caught on a cell-phone camera. Oh yes whatever they could do to Carrie in 1976 the Internet has made even worse. Director Kimberly Peirce (""Boys Dont Cry"") brings nuance to the mother who is monstrous but no longer a monster in this telling. Peirce makes use of Moores force her capacity for irrationality and her eerie ability to scare an audience just by raising one eyebrow. At the same time Moore suggests a history - one never told just hinted at - of serious damage in her own past. By the way the mothers variety of Catholicism is her own invention. ""Intercourse was the first sin"" she raves a supposedly biblical quote that she makes up. She also has a nutty idea which she repeats with great intensity that men can ""smell the blood"" on Carrie and that now theyll be circling her like lust-ridden sharks. Almost 40 years later ""Carrie"" is still irresistible as a formula. It takes something that everyone knows - that high school can be socially difficult - and links that to something wonderfully flashy a seemingly defenseless girl whose emerging telekinetic power is directly connected to emotional agitation. You could be a saint watching this and still look forward to whats going to happen when she gets really mad. Judy Greer is a warm presence as a sympathetic though limited gym teacher and Portia Doubleday does not hold back as Carries nemesis Chris. Her attack is direct with no moral shadings to spoil the pleasure. Chris is just evil. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Theres no reason an old horror movie cant claw its way out of the grave with a great remake. David Cronenbergs ""The Fly"" and John Carpenters ""The Thing"" topped the films that inspired them. Such thrilling reincarnations are possible but rare. The second go-round for ""Carrie"" doesnt intoxicate you with the strange brew of sleaze satire sensuality and shock that made Brian De Palmas 1976 adaptation a high-style pulp classic. Its like going to prom with somebody you like not somebody you love. The material of Stephen Kings high school horror novel has perennial appeal. If anything its story of a scorned telekinetic girl striking back against her cruel classmate is even more resonant now. With Chloe Grace Moretz as the abused wallflower Carrie White Julianne Moore as her unhinged fundamentalist mama and Kimberly Peirce (""Boys Dont Cry"") in the directors chair theres talent to spare. Yet the fever-pitch grotesquerie of the original eludes them. ""Carrie"" redux often replicates the De Palma version sometimes with verbatim quotes of shots and lines of dialogue. Its not a beat-for-beat copy however. Peirces film is a more feminine take on the material. Its intensely attuned to the gossipy hive mind of bitchy girls cliques and the way womens self-loathing can turn to self-mutilation. It serves up baroque images of female sexuality and adds a prologue about Margarets pregnancy that demonstrates Carrie was cursed from her first breath. CARRIE  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for bloody violence disturbing images language and some sexual content. Moaning in agony in her bedroom Margaret delivers the child the spawn of a ""sinful"" tryst in a spasm of shame and disgust. For a long horrific moment she considers killing the newborn before her maternal instincts kick in. Overprotective yet monstrous Moores Bible-thumping religious zealot makes Nurse Ratched look like a Candy Striper. When repressed Carrie enters late-blooming puberty her first menstrual blood staining the floor of her high school shower the cool girls cruelly humiliate her flinging tampons. Through some psychosexual link Carries supernatural power well flows like a surge of PMS wrath shattering water coolers and breaking mirrors. The resentful girls orchestrate a vicious retaliation. Dousing Carrie with a bucket of blood at the prom is vicious but doing it at the moment a rigged election crowns her queen exalting her with feelings of euphoria and popularity -- thats sadistic genius. Peirces staging of the attack and Carries vengeful psychic outburst lacks the anxiety-provoking slow motion and sinuous split-screen suspense of the original. And this time her apocalyptic rage is tempered. She lashes out in large part out of grief that her prom date is killed by the falling bucket and when she goes on the attack she does not slaughter foes and friends alike. By keeping the focus on punishing her predators the scene undercuts the full horror of Carries murderous uncontrollable backlash. Moretz a confident actress doesnt project the vulnerability that made Sissy Spacek at once sympathetic and pathetic. We feel sorry for Moretz but its hard to see why shes singled out as an object of torment by her peers. Spacek was geekier more awkward with a wounded stare the sort of ugly duckling that teenage swans would understandably attack. No matter how she hunches her shoulders and drops her eyes Moretz doesnt have that invisible ""Kick Me"" sign on her back. When her Carrie snaps shes less an innocent turned monster than an X-Men character having a really bad day. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

VPC Claudia Puig USA TODAY 654 p.m. EDT October 17 2013The remake of the 1976 Stephen King shocker misses a chance to take the story in new directions.Chloe Moretz left and Julianne Moore star in the remake of the Stephen King classic Carrie.(Photo Michael Gibson Sony Pictures)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review  out of fourStars Chloe Grace Moretz Julianne Moore Portia Doubleday Gabriella WildeRated R; Runtime 1 hour 40 minutes; opens Friday nationwide 165 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 5 COMMENTEMAILMORERather than offering new blood Carrie is a purely cosmetic revamp.Theres nothing inventive in the retelling of this American horror story based on Stephen Kings best-selling 1974 novel.If director Kimberly Peirce had brought a measure of the intriguing sensibility she demonstrated in 1999s Boys Dont Cry this reboot ( out of four; rated R; opens Friday nationwide) might have been worth seeing. But Peirces version lacks the immediacy of Brian De Palmas original. The result feels like a pale imitation.The story centers on Carrie White (Chloe Grace Moretz) a bullied teen misfit who wreaks vengeance on her high school classmates.STORY Carrie reborn for a new generationMORE What spooks Julianne Moore? (Hint Not Freddy Krueger)REVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersIn repurposing it Peirce could have gone for all-out over-the-top camp. Or she could have made a more serious film closer to Kings original text about a lonely outcast tormented by her holy roller mother and mistreated by her peers.Instead Peirce spends too much time on an entitled one-note Queen Bee (Portia Doubleday) who fires f-bombs at teachers humiliates Carrie and posts a video of the degradation and plots more malicious deeds.Carrie is an intriguingly woebegone character and the focus should have stayed on her.Painfully shy and endlessly mocked -- even by one of her teachers for her selection of poetry -- Carrie has no refuge. At home her domineering religious zealot mom (Julianne Moore) alternates between babying Carrie and believing that the devil has overtaken her for wearing a sleeveless dress. When Carrie discovers she has telekinetic powers the audience is rooting for her.The audience is still on her side when she uses the powers to mildly punish a bratty kid who calls her crazy and to keep her mom from preventing her from going out. But then Carrie goes too far.When she wields her telekinesis for vengeful destruction -- during a climactic scene at the prom that anyone who has seen the 1976 De Palma version with Sissy Spacek will never forget -- the hell she unleashes is excessive. But in this version its more tedious than terrifying.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Julianne Moore talks about going grey for her role in the forthcoming Carrie remake while Chloe Grace Moretz who takes on the title role reveals why it was important to act without makeup. (Oct. 15) APPerhaps its because weve seen so much cinematic gore in the 37 years since the original hit screens. Thats all the more reason why this film should have taken a different tack. Its not enough to merely update the era and add smartphones into the mix. Peirce should have taken either a more comic tone (as in Moretzs Kick-Ass movies) or a more somber one exploring social isolation and assessing the damaging influences of school bullies and a mother who locks her daughter in a closet to repent.Moretz and Moore do their best with the one-dimensional material but they deserve better.The movie also suffers from not knowing when to end. The havoc Carrie unleashes grows numbing as it drags on.""You can only push someone so far before they break"" sums up a classmate.If only those pushing the buttons on this movie had gone farther and provided audiences with something more than a bland retread. 165 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 5 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1aSOavaFall Movies Calendar OctoberTake a look at the films heading to the box office this October.

"Review Carrie hasnt evolved much since 1976 - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Carrie hasnt evolved much since 1976 A behind-the-scenes look at filming around the world for television and movies as seen from the streets. | Full coverage | Behind the scenes Classic Hollywood Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic ""Carrie"" the horror cult classic based on novelist Stephen Kings great girl roar against bullies body religion and mom is back on the big screen with more teen trauma than ever and a new party dress for the prom.And yet.... Directed by ""Boys Dont Crys"" Kimberly Peirce and starring an excellent Chloe Grace Moretz with a truly troubling Julianne Moore as Mama ""Carrie"" should have delivered more with the material in the filmmakers feminist hands.Instead Peirce has done a remaking rather than a reimagining. Echoes of the 1976 original the Brian De Palma-Sissy Spacek-Piper Laurie tirade that first rocked the cradle abound. PHOTOS Hollywood backlot momentsThis is not to dismiss ""Carrie"" as a bad movie; it is not. Peirce has made good use of all the new-age technology at her disposal -- more ways to exploit and expose the storys central image of blood and show off Carries telekinetic powers. Screenwriters Lawrence D. Cohen and Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa have added a prominent spot for those modern-day cyber-bully buddies -- cellphones and social networks -- with the widespread public humiliation they afford never more relevant.But still....King came up with such a compelling and provocative conceit in addressing the difficulties of adolescent girls particularly ones who feel like freaks already and are ill-equipped to contend with massive changes in a body they dont yet understand. I had hoped that Peirce -- whose cut on transgender teens in 1999s ""Boys"" was so incisively and inventively rendered winning an Oscar for Hilary Swank -- would find something more to say about the way gender politics have changed since the 1970s. PHOTOS Billion-dollar movie clubThe current ""Carrie"" however is never able to get past De Palmas singular imprint to make a distinctive statement of its own.The film opens with a real sense of possibility. Peirce offers up a tragic and terrifying piece of the Carrie puzzle thats not made it to screen before -- a genesis moment if you will. But then the movie settles into the now-familiar tale of Carries high school terrors.A girl from a strange family with a dead father and a weird mother Carrie White has been the butt of jokes from the day she set foot in school. Sheltered repressed and hovered over by a mother who thinks sex is a sin and menstruation Gods curse Carrie is completely unaware of the physical changes that are coming. So when she gets her first period in first period -- in the communal showers after gym class -- the mean girls turn on her with a vengeance pelting her with tampons and taunts.SNEAKS Movie trailers full coverageIt is a powerful image one that De Palma made iconic. The steam of the shower Carrie naked the hysteria at seeing the blood the rain of sanitary napkins all work to put everyone on notice that the film intends to make you as uncomfortable as possible.Peirce has shot it with a great deal of conviction the kind that will shake anyone who has never seen the moment before. Whats interesting is that it carries relevance today in a time when ads for ""feminine protection"" products fill the TV screen and teen magazines. But break new ground? It does not.From there the film starts its steady deadly march toward that devastating prom and that other iconic image of newly crowned prom queen Carrie drenched in a bucket of blood the full force of her telekinetic rage unleashed against her tormentors.PHOTOS Celebrities by The TimesAll the players and the plays are basically as King envisioned them. Miss Desjardin (Judy Greer) is the gym teacher who tries to salvage a bit of Carries pride. Chris (Portia Doubleday) is the main meanie who works overtime to make Carries life a living hell with the help of her bad-boy boyfriend Billy (Alex Russell). Sue (Gabriella Wilde) is the popular good girl who decides to pay penance for Carries locker-room humiliation by pressing her boyfriend the dreamy jock Tommy Ross (Ansel Elgort) to take Carrie to the prom.Meanwhile Carries on her own journey of empowerment. She starts warming up for the big event by facing off against Mama at home. Lots of anger and flying objects. The insane proselytizing to which the girl is subjected plus the closet her mother reserves for punishment and praying somehow seem terrifyingly possible still.As good as Moretz has been in the literary high of ""Hugo"" and the bruising fun of ""Kick-Ass"" Peirce pulls out a sensitivity and depth in the young actress that brings her performance to a new level. And Moore has never had a better handle on demented.But except for a ridiculously sanitized new ending new ""Carrie"" is not that different from old ""Carrie.""

To read the whole story subscribe to BostonGlobe.com CARRIE Share Comment The news that ""Carrie"" a remake of the classic Brian De Palma shriekfest would be directed by Kimberly Peirce (""Boys Dont Cry"") and star Chloe Grace Moretz and Julianne Moore raised hopes of a re-do with added layers of empathy thwarted empowerment teen-grrl retribution. Man what a disappointment. The new ""Carrie"" is a thoroughly dispiriting retread that could have directed by any proficient Hollywood hack. It steps carefully in the footprints of De Palmas film sometimes down to the shot language and retells this story without ever giving us a reason to watch it again. Theres something to be said for having an actual teenager play the title role -- but theres more to be said for the stunned almost childlike performance of the 27-year-old Sissy Spacek in the original.

(AP) By Michael OSullivan October 17 2013 I always thought that ""Carrie"" -- the 1976 horror film based on novelist Stephen Kings debut about a telekinetic teenage misfit whose self-loathing turns outward when she is the victim of bullying -- was more sad than scary. It was disturbing to be sure and almost operatic in the climactic crescendo of violence that Brian De Palma depicted the title character wreaking havoc on her tormentors in a high-school gymnasium on prom night. But despite (or perhaps because of) seeing acne-prone evildoers punished with a mythic and indiscriminate fury it felt more like Greek tragedy than horror. Director Kimberly Peirce has called her sturdy remake starring Chloe Grace Moretz in the role made famous by Sissy Spacek a ""superhero origin story."" And there are some moments when the new film feels a bit like the next ""X-Men"" installment. One scene in particular when Carrie is just learning how to control her new powers and a pile of telekinesis reference books is floating around her bedroom is just this side of cheesy. For the most part though ""Carrie"" holds its power to rattle thanks to a sympathetic performance by Moretz and an icky one by Julianne Moore as Carries religiously wackadoodle mother who regularly locks her daughter in a closet and in Peirces re-telling mutilates herself with sewing tools. Superhero or supervillain Carrie is enormously relatable with Peirce bringing to bear the full force of the directors affinity -- nay advocacy -- for outsiders so evident in her transgender-themed first film ""Boys Dont Cry."" ""Carrie"" the tale of a gawky teen who is led to believe that the class hunk (Ansel Elgort) likes her but who is then humiliated by a mean girl on steroids (Portia Doubleday) is heartbreaking. That story is also strengthened by the passage of time. The original ""Carrie"" could be read as a universal allegory of adolescence. Who hasnt felt like a freak in high school or fantasized about lashing out -- or more often inward -- after being hurt or rejected? But more recent events -- the Columbine massacre and the news just this week that a young Florida girl killed herself after being taunted by bullies who allegedly boasted about it online -- have added resonance to the source material. Peirce takes full advantage of this zeitgeist updating the story for the Facebook and YouTube age with the assistance of screenwriters Lawrence D. Cohen who wrote the original ""Carrie"" adaptation and Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa perhaps best known as the script-doctor hired to fix the Broadway musical ""Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark"" after Julie Taymor was fired. Early in the film in the famous shower scene when Carrie gets her period without knowing what it is a classmate immediately whips out her cellphone and then posts the video of a bloody bawling Carrie online. The casual cruelty feels frighteningly real. Is ""Carrie"" a massive improvement over the original? No. De Palmas film is a classic and its theme of the bullied becoming the bully still resonates. But the new film which includes some of the same lines from the original plus an even bigger bloodbath at the end works for a new audience. Its as affecting as drama as it is effective as horror. It wrenches even as it unnerves. Cinematically it may be unnecessary. But from a sociological standpoint perhaps we need ""Carrie"" now more than ever.    R. At area theaters.

Michael Gibson Chloe Moretz (left) and Judy Greer in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures and Screen Gems ""Carrie."" MGM/Screen Gems ""Carrie"" Remaking a movie like Brian DePalmas creepy 1976 classic ""Carrie"" is as terrifying a proposition as taking its title character to the prom.Horror-movie remakes are a dime a dozen. Just look at the string of B-movies like ""Friday the 13th"" ""Prom Night"" and ""My Bloody Valentine"" which have been updated into modern-day B-movies with slightly bigger budgets.Duplication is even tougher when a gold-standard horror flick is involved as the producers of the 1998 ""Psycho"" remake found. Fittingly ""The Exorcist"" and ""Rosemarys Baby"" are remake-free. A new ""Carrie"" comes to the big screen after a substantial buildup which included a release date delay to take advantage of a ""Paranormal Activity""-free Halloween season.Director Kimberly Peirce (""Boys Dont Cry"") and stars Chloe Grace Moretz and Julianne Moore have a big bloody prom dress to fill in reimagining the terror DePalma Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie had previously brought forth.And long before the blood starts spilling its clear the new team has mostly nailed it.The reboot is as good a ""Carrie"" remake as possible though its not truly a scary movie; the film takes its time living up to its R rating.This update which uses Stephen Kings novel as source material opens with a religious Margaret White giving birth to a child she resentfully views as the result of sin.The child grows up to be mousy misfit Carrie (Moretz) who is dumbfounded by the flow of menstrual blood in the shower. The mean girls in her class respond by pummeling her with tampons and taunts of ""plug it up"" led by hateful Chris (Portia Doubleday). The bullies also film the ordeal with their phones for uploading later one of the films modern updates.Carrie slowly discovers she has telekinetic powers which she uses to make a water cooler explode knock a boy off his bicycle and levitate books and her own bed.Its not long before shes flinging her mother around the room not undeservedly. Margaret has a thing for keeping Carrie locked up in a prayer closet. Good-girl classmate Sue (a stunning Gabriella Wilde) guilted by her participation in the assault of Carrie persuades her jock boyfriend Tommy (Ansel Elgort no William Katt) to escort Carrie to the prom. Carries desire to blend in with the ""normal"" kids upsets Margaret.You know the rest -- Chris need for revenge after shes banned from the prom the pig-slaughter scene the reference to ""dirty pillows"" and the promise that ""theyre all going to laugh at you"" all re-created here leading up to the prom.Ahhh the prom. Any adaptation of ""Carrie"" regardless of A-list stars or a critically acclaimed director is ultimately only as good as its prom. And this one delivers with a longer sequence and a better car scene with Chris and her awful boyfriend Billy (Alex Russell). Chris enhanced fate will delight the most jaded of horror fans. ""Carrie"" is in expert hands with director Peirce. Moretz displays just the right amount of sweet innocence and evokes a certain amount of sympathy even when shes doing her worst. And Moore is wonderful in full-throttle loony mode allowed to go over the top without being campy.The new movie wont overshadow the superior original but that was never the point.

Share Tweet In Carrie the latest ""reimagining"" of Stephen Kings career-launching revenge fable Chloe Grace Moretz slips into the blood-soaked prom dress of the title telepath transported out of the 70s and into a new era of Internet-abetted cruelty. On paper the casting makes sense Moretz of Let Me In and the Kick-Ass movies has the proper temperament--an ability to turn on a dime from adolescent innocence to volcanic rage. (Plus she looks great drenched in viscera.) What the young starlet lacks--and this was the crucial quality that Sissy Spacek brought to the role in 1976--is a credible otherness. In previous incarnations Carrie White was a real odd duck so improperly socialized that she almost seemed to have been raised on a different planet. Moretz with her soft cherubic features and flowing locks isnt just too conventionally pretty for the part. Shes too adjusted coming across less like the ""very peculiar girl"" King described in his novel and more like the stealth babe of some nottie-to-hottie teen romance. Buying that this girl would have trouble making friends or snagging a genuine date to the dance is even harder than pretending that a pair of glasses makes Rachael Leigh Cook look undesirable. In ways that extend far beyond Spaceks authentically awkward performance Brian De Palmas Carrie was something of an odd duck too. It swapped tones and perspectives constantly nodding to the epistolary nature of its source material by spending as much time with the supporting characters as with Carrie herself. Were it possible to forget that genre milestone for even a second the remake could be judged on its own merits. But this new Carrie is like the recent Straw Dogs a faded Xerox. Director Kimberly Peirce (Boys Dont Cry) has replicated the De Palma film scene for scene but also drained every drop of camp humor and crazed craftsmanship as one might remove the blood from a sow. Once again the late onset of puberty jolts the plot into motion Poor Carrie learns of both her monthly burden and her special powers in the locker room while her classmates pelt her with tampons. A sympathetic gym teacher (Judy Greer) intervenes inciting the wrath of the queen bitch (Portia Doubleday). To amend for her role in the torment another of the mean girls (Gabriella Wilde) talks her good-natured boyfriend (Ansel Elgort) into asking Carrie to prom. The dance and the pigs the bucket and the blood the fire and the knives--all are trotted out anew for an audience presumably too young to have even absorbed these iconic images through cultural osmosis. Depressing as it is to see a classic cannibalized Carrie actually fares even worse when it deviates. As the heroines mother a role previously and masterly occupied by Piper Laurie Julianne Moore cranks the crazy to 11. Her Mrs. White is truly loony tunes banging her head against the wall cutting herself under her dress and--in a needless prologue--stopping just short of gouging out her newborn babys eyes with a pair of rusty scissors. (Moore doesnt so much chew the scenery as bleed all over it.) Where the movie really errs though is in the fateful finale--and not just because Peirce stages it without a fraction of the verve De Palma brought to his split-screen climax. Perhaps its impossible in a post-Columbine world to fully groove on the apocalyptic retaliation of a class misfit. But by making Carries rampage subjective with her wrath reserved almost exclusively for those who ""deserve"" it Peirce dilutes the ghastly power--the full insane horror--of her big setpiece. Its a strange thing to say about a movie so obsessed with the red stuff but this Carrie is bloodless.

TWITTER Chloe Grace Moretz and Julianne Moore star in Kimberly Peirces remake of the 1976 horror classic based on the novel by Stephen King. While 1970s horror is a long way from 1950s romantic comedy Sissy Spaceks performance in Brian De Palmas Carrie left no less indelible an imprint on the role than say Audrey Hepburn in Sabrina or Judy Holliday in Born Yesterday. And as the folks behind the lifeless 90s remakes of those films learned the hard way messing with a classic -- particularly one with such an iconic lead -- is a losing proposition. So its surprising that Kimberly Peirces respectful Carrie overhaul is as entertaining as it is even if the prom-night bloodbath never escapes the long shadow of its predecessor. Pauline Kael summed up the singular pleasures of the De Palma film calling it ""a terrifyingly lyrical thriller."" She went on to describe its ""perverse mixture of comedy and horror and tension like that of Hitchcock or Polanski but with a lulling sensuousness."" The lyricism and playfulness are both in shorter supply here. But while the remake is at times too self-serious its never boring or dumb which is often the case with horror updates. Whats more it captures the tender tortured mother-daughter conflict at the center of Stephen Kings indestructibly compelling story in vivid performances from Chloe Grace Moretz and Julianne Moore as the title character and her nut-job religious-fanatic parent Margaret White. Having made only three features over 14 years Peirce remains best known for the searing sensitivity of her 1999 breakout drama Boys Dont Cry which like Carrie is a story of outsider hostility taken to extremes. The pairing of a director new to the genre and the promise of a return to Kings source novel made it natural to expect a fresh stamp on the material. However the remake is less faithful to the book than was the 2002 television version with Angela Bettis and Patricia Clarkson. In fact it frequently seems like a slavish homage to De Palmas film recycling much of the same dialogue. Both adaptations share a screenwriter Lawrence D. Cohen working here with Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa. Perhaps the most startling departure is the prologue. In a scene lifted from the novel Moores Bible-thumping Margaret wails her way through unassisted childbirth alone in a clapboard suburban house that creaks and groans throughout the entire movie. She resists the urge to kill the consequence of her sin and the baby of course grows up to be Moretzs painfully shy telekinetic teen Carrie. Gym class becomes pool volleyball teasing us with the queasy expectation that Carries traumatic first experience of menstruation might happen right there in the shallow end. But Peirce sticks to the original model ushering Carrie off to the showers minus De Palmas displays of slow-mo nudity. The big difference this time around is that when Carries terrified response to her first period makes her an instant laughing stock one of the mean girls participating in her humiliation films the incident on her smartphone. When that video is posted online Carries mortification unleashes the full force of her telekinetic powers. She understands and masters those gifts far more intuitively than in previous versions a choice that robs Moretzs performance of some vulnerability. Like last years off-Broadway attempt to salvage the legendary flop 1988 musical adaptation this update again uses bullying in the age of social media to heighten Carries victimization. But Peirce and her screenwriters mercifully refrain from hammering the contemporary relevance keeping the influence of technology on the story to a minimum. The basic plot points remain the same. Remorseful over her involvement in Carries ordeal willowy blonde Sue Snell (Gabriella Wilde) persuades her jock dreamboat boyfriend Tommy Ross (Ansel Elgort) to take the lonely misfit to the prom. But what should be a glorious night for a girl finally given a taste of social acceptance and liberated from her abusive overprotective mother instead goes horribly wrong. Thats thanks to the hateful scheme of class bitch Chris Hargensen (Portia Doubleday) and her vicious boyfriend Billy Nolan (Alex Russell). Making Chris the spoilt daddys girl of a slick bullying lawyer (an uncredited Hart Bochner) was a nice touch. But the high-school populace here is a colorless bunch lacking the personality of their counterparts in the De Palma movie. The exception is Judy Greer who brings warmth female solidarity and smarts to her scenes as the concerned gym teacher (Betty Buckley in the original). The films nods to De Palma are often amusing. Peirce also slips in a wink to another 70s genre landmark The Exorcist as Carrie sharpens her telekinesis skills with some bedroom levitation. In general the director goes for intensity grounded in reality eschewing the usual fallback of jump scares and cheap shocks. The character-driven human story that interests her is that of a frightened outcast confused by whats happening to her body torn in her loyalty to a dangerously unhinged mother and jolted by peer cruelty into violence. Some of the most effective scenes are those in which Carrie takes charge at home stopping her mother in her tracks with some unholy tricks that feed Margarets escalating hysteria. In a role that calls for over-the-top Moore is terrific bringing just the right hint of restraint. Shes less of a fire-and-brimstone loon than Piper Laurie in the 1976 film but still plenty crazy shuffling around the shadows like a J-horror ghoul. With her long witchy hair and dowdy sack-dresses Margaret is an unnerving figure railing against a godless world in a quiet mutter rather than a thunderous roar. Giving her a self-mutilation habit seems a bit much but her troubled relationship with Carrie is deftly drawn revealing the love and pain beneath the warped bid for salvation. Moretz is an imperfect fit for the role but as always a captivating presence -- hunched over and folded in on herself in an effort to be invisible at school or trembling at the damnation hurled by her mother until she summons the strength to fight back. Shes at her loveliest in the calm before the storm at the prom when she finally trusts Tommy enough to relax and enjoy the magically unfamiliar sensation of being a normal teenager. She doesnt come close to the heartbreaking fragility and ethereality of Spacek in the part but who could? Some will see it as an interesting choice and others a banal one that the filmmakers have rendered Carrie a more modern girl. When her moment of radiance at the prom was shattered Spacek shifted into catatonic trance mode virtually sleepwalking through Carries trail of pitiless vengeance. Moretz puts the character in control of the paranormal hellfire shes unleashing twisting her head and arms in angular movements that are part alien part Balinese dancer part Norma Desmond. Advancements in digital effects technology since prior versions mean the climactic mayhem predictably gets kicked up a few notches. Familiar as the developments inevitably are at this point the prom scene is still suspenseful and horrifying even if the action becomes too chaotic to catch everything thats going on. The aftermath is more uneven. Peirce indulges in silly excess in stretching out the payback dealt to vile Chris and Billy. Sometimes less is more. The fate of Margaret is better handled with the director wisely borrowing from De Palma who borrowed from Saint Sebastian imagery. However a perfunctory snippet of Sue being questioned at the subsequent inquiry adds nothing and a reference to the originals closing scare is cheesy. The movie looks polished and is well paced though less sparing use of Marco Beltramis lush score might not have been a bad idea. If De Palmas version was one part adolescent dream three parts nightmare with a sly streak of satire running through it Peirces is a more earnest yet still engrossing take on the story that should connect with contemporary teens. At the very least it might send fledgling horror buffs scurrying to their Netflix queues to watch a vintage masterpiece of the genre.

Like the Passion Play and ""A Christmas Carol"" this is the kind of engrained fable that gets told over and over again even when almost everyone in the audience knows every beat of the plot. The story has become a touchstone to generations of misfits and outsiders; in between its two big-screen versions it spawned a movie sequel (""The Rage Carrie 2"") a small-screen adaptation written by Bryan Fuller (""Hannibal"") and even an infamous Broadway musical. There will be more versions of ""Carrie"" in the years to come and perhaps one of them will rival Brian De Palmas 1976 film as a portrait of adolescent outsider-dom and as a purely terrifying piece of horror cinema. This new one is neither; it doesnt do anything strikingly wrong its just unnecessary. See video Carrie Cafe Viral Video Scares the Coffee Out of Patrons Any hope that director Kimberly Peirce might inflect the material with the gender insight of ""Boys Dont Cry"" or the working-class ethos of ""Stop-Loss"" is quickly dispelled. Its one thing to respect the source material but something else entirely to waver from it so little. De Palmas screenwriter Lawrence D. Cohen shares credit here with Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa a scribe whose teen angst bona fides have been established everywhere from ""Glee"" to Archie Comics but apart from some references to YouTube and home-schooling youd be hard-pressed to find much difference between the two scripts. So its a story you already know told in a way youll recognize Sweet shy Carrie (Chloe Grace Moretz) is tormented by the popular girls at school and abused at home by her unhinged evangelist mother (Julianne Moore). Prom date pigs blood dirty pillows second verse same as the first. Also read 5 Breakout Movie Stars of Fall Its up to the actors to try to make this their own but none of them fill the shoes of their Me Decade predecessors. Moretz probably comes closest to capturing Sissy Spaceks blossoming into womanhood although Moretz is less convincing as a misunderstood wallflower. Unlike Spacek she has been directed to find excitement and possibilities in her newly manifesting telekinetic powers resulting in a Carrie who feels at least a little more in control of her destiny. Moore as talented is she is cant rival Piper Lauries Bible-thumping gorgon in either terror or ecstasy although her version of the character provides more opportunities for bloody self-mortification. Judy Greer is as always a standout as the sympathetic gym teacher.

Audiences seeing the De Palma version were generally speaking seeing Amy Irving William Katt Nancy Allen P.J. Soles and John Travolta for the first time and those actors immediately registered in the public consciousness. I would have a hard time picking their modern counterparts out of a police lineup; they all have the bland interchangeable attractiveness of stars from the CW network. Its not that this 2013 ""Carrie"" embarrasses itself -- theyre not all going to laugh at you -- but its destined to be at best a footnote to its forebears. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday October 17 2013 221 PM Title Carrie Film Info R Violence blood language sexual content. Area theaters. The female-centric energy in the new version of ""Carrie"" stands apart from so many other entries in the horror genre. But whats most surprising in Kimberly Peirces slight unessential but still effective remake is that the psychic explosion still burns. This is not an update that layers new meaning onto the original material. As in Stephen Kings career-making 1974 novel and the still-creepy 1976 Brian De Palma screamer it spawned little is explained about the telekinesis that affects young Carrie White (Chloe Grace Moretz). She lives alone in the bad end of town with her religious fanatic mother (Julianne Moore) whose oppressively prudish ways force her teenage daughter to dress in old-lady frocks and avoid boys. Carries (Chloe Grace Moretz) episode in the girls shower at school really sets things in motion. When Carrie has a bloody episode in the girls shower at school its one more indignity her cruel classmates tease her about. What they dont know is the girl they call ""Creepy Carrie"" has by becoming a woman come into her own as a telepath. She can move objects shatter glass and control things with her mind. Mama (Julianne Moore) is not thrilled with Carries (Chloe Grace Moretz) slinky gown. One of her nemeses Sue (Gabriella Wilde) hopes to make amends by having her dull but benign boyfriend (Ansel Elgort) whom Carrie is crushing on take lonely Carrie to the prom. But mean girl Chris (Portia Doubleday) spoils it all by planting a bucket of pigs blood above the stage. And what happens next is one of those pop-culture moments that really is hard to do wrong. Carrie (Chloe Grace Moretz) heads to the prom with Tommy (Ansel Elgort) in ""Carrie."" With the exception of some appearances by social media ""Carrie"" doesnt try to hip up Kings basic often slow story. And while De Palmas version is fondly recalled as a high-blood-mark of the 1970s this new take seems to linger a bit more on the bugaboos of overparenting and bullying while underplaying Mamas fanaticism. Peirce (""Boys Dont Cry"") only glancingly lets her heroine have a mild discovery-of-powers moment that feels ""X-Men""-ish. Seeing red Carrie (Chloe Grace Moretz) sets out for revenge on her tormenters in ""Carrie."" Where Sissy Spacek seemed otherworldly and haunted in De Palmas film Moretz (""Hugo"" ""Kick-Ass"") is sadder. Shes a terrific young actress. If she isnt quite as deep here as she was in the vampire coming-of-age drama ""Let Me In"" shes able to do more than prowl about as she did in ""Dark Shadows."" As for Moore she uses her angular severity well and shes a good fiend to have around. If Carries sympathetic gym teacher (here played by Judy Greer) gets a reprieve her 1976 counterpart didnt have during the final massacre its the one concession Peirce makes to modern sensibilities. Luckily the film doesnt pig out on PC-ness. jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"Carrie 2 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article Carrie 2 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED NEWS Interview Director Kimberly Peirce By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Oct 17 2013 1019 AM Whats the point? Thats the question youll most likely ask after watching ""Carrie"" a wholly unnecessary remake of Brian De Palmas great 1976 film based on the Stephen King novel. A lot of talented people got together to remake the movie including director Kimberly Peirce (""Boys Dont Cry"") Chloe Grace Moretz in the title role and Julianne Moore as her religious-fanatic mother. Yet aside from some viral video and a small tweak here and there this is basically the same movie as De Palmas. Just not as good. Granted not everyone who sees this film will have seen the original. Too bad. Because although it is indeed a scary horror movie it also gets at the non-supernatural horrors of high school like bullying jealousy and burgeoning sexuality. The remake is mostly concerned with pigs blood. Carrie White (Moretz) is a social outcast in the extreme the type of kid the other students make fun of especially the sadistic Chris (Portia Doubleday believably reprehensible). As in the original film Carrie begins to menstruate in the shower and doesnt know what is happening to her; she thinks she is bleeding to death. Chris and the other girls tease her and begin throwing tampons at her. Chris never one to miss a chance to further humiliate someone captures the event on her iPhone later uploading it to a YouTube-like site. Its the only update in the movie that resonates. Carries mother Margaret uses the occasion to further rail against the evil nature of man -- or men more specifically. She locks Carrie in a ""prayer closet."" The whole experience awakens in Carrie a power she didnt realize she had telekinesis with which she begins to experiment. Meanwhile Sue Snell (Gabriella Wilde) one of Chris running mates starts to feel guilty. She convinces her boyfriend Tommy (Ansel Elgort) the resident hot guy to ask Carrie to prom. He reluctantly goes along with it. If you saw the first movie you know whats coming next. If you didnt you wont have to wait long to find out; the remake spends a large chunk of time setting it up to the detriment of other story lines that could have been developed more fully. Without giving away too much this is worth noting In the original film when Carrie played by Sissy Spacek is pushed too far it is like an explosion of pent-up abuse and emotion finally unleashed. In the remake Carrie has far greater control over her actions. What once was an act of uncontrollable passion has now become premeditated. The original cast included John Travolta Nancy Allen and Piper Laurie (who like Spacek was nominated for an Oscar). Moore is certainly their equal but isnt as invested as Laurie who also played Margaret. Moretz is also quite talented but we never quite get the sense of alienation Spacek brought to the role. Comparisons are unfair and inevitable. But even when taken on its own terms the new ""Carrie"" rings hollow a horror movie that is unsure of itself with little to offer the uninitiated and less to offer fans of the first film.

""You will know her name"" scream the posters for the new bigscreen version of ""Carrie"" as if anyone could forget it after seeing Brian De Palmas brilliant 1976 movie or reading the original Stephen King novel. Aimed at captivating a new generation of viewers unfamiliar with the tale of a cruelly unloved high schooler who unleashes telekinetic revenge on her classmates director Kimberly Peirces intermittently effective third feature eschews De Palmas diabolical wit and voluptuous style in favor of a somber straight-faced retelling steeped in a now-familiar horror-movie idiom of sharp objects shuddering sound effects and dark rivulets of blood.This story first appeared in the October 22 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. The Sony/Screen Gems release will likely conjure a decent B.O. opening before dipping steadily thereafter following the commercial pattern of the many slasher movies and supernatural thrillers it rather too closely resembles especially in the sadistically overwrought f/x-heavy closing reel. But while it cant hope to match the galvanizing impact of its predecessors (not counting the ill-fated 1999 sequel ""The Rage Carrie 2"" or the notorious 1988 Broadway musical flop) Peirces film works for a considerable stretch as a derivative but impressively coherent vision. Certainly theres a case to be made for revisiting ""Carrie"" now given the alarming prevalence of teenage bullying public cyber-humiliation and fatal acts of retaliation in the post-Columbine era. Chief among the films selling points are an intensely committed Chloe Grace Moretz and Julianne Moore enacting a subtler more psychologically insidious take on the mother-daughter relationship immortalized by Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie. That twisted character dynamic looms over the proceedings from the opening childbirth scene which quickly familiarizes the viewer with the films menstrual color scheme and establishes Margaret White (Moore) as a dangerous religious fanatic who receives her infant daughter as divine punishment for her sexual sins. Years later the girl has grown up to be the painfully shy and awkward Carrie (Moretz) whose crucible of suffering onscreen begins and ends with an outpouring of blood. In one of a handful of shrewd 21st-century innovations devised by screenwriters Lawrence D. Cohen and Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa Carries locker-room humiliation at the hands of her female classmates is captured on video and quickly goes viral setting off a chain of events that will ultimately bring about the storys fiery prom-night climax. Up until that epic conflagration -- which seems to play out at twice the length it did in the first film and with far more Grand Guignol overkill -- ""Carrie"" sustains interest as a moody psychological/paranormal drama with a melancholy undertow that at times tilts into genuine pathos. If the film never quite shakes off the feeling of having been constructed from a well-worn blueprint it has a sensitive interpreter in Peirce who so powerfully evoked the inner world of another tortured misunderstood individual in 1999s ""Boys Dont Cry"" and who here offers a fresh intelligent spin on certain key aspects of a largely familiar tale. Notably De Palmas luridly funny sensibility is little in evidence; Peirce has excised every dirty chuckle and whisper of camp from the material nudging the story in a more textured realistic direction. Both the hateful Chris Hargensen (Portia Doubleday) and conflicted good girl Sue Snell (Gabriella Wilde) are fleshed out with a touch more nuance than usual. And Carrie begins to experience a flicker of self-worth as she spends time cultivating her telekinetic powers in ""Exorcist""-style levitation scenes that suggest the origin story of a comicbook superheroine or a more adult version of Roald Dahls ""Matilda."" Perhaps Peirces shrewdest calculation is to play the Carrie-Margaret relationship almost completely straight (though ""I can see your dirty pillows"" still gets a laugh). Crucially the characters arguments are not just shrill screaming matches but careful negotiations of power and control (complicated at one point by Carries own impressive command of Scripture) which can suddenly give way to moments of striking tenderness. One senses that the love between mother and daughter twisted beyond recognition though it may be is chillingly genuine; they truly have no one else but each other. Between this and ""What Maisie Knew"" Moore is on a bit of a bad-mama roll and rather than trying to compete with Piper Lauries fire-and-brimstone bellow she acts with a hushed feverish intensity. Given to not just banging her head against walls but also quietly mortifying her flesh in private this Margaret is no towering Gorgon but a desperately damaged woman capable of terrorizing her daughter with no more than a gentle caress or a single piercing stare. For her part Moretz can scarcely be blamed for falling short of one of the most iconic performances in horror cinema; Spacek may have given the remake her blessing (as has De Palma) but no other actress could capture that hauntingly lost quality she brought to the role of Carrie White making her not just a shy misunderstood waif but a mesmerizingly alien presence. By contrast Moretz though superficially deglammed with a strawberry-blonde mop is still rather too comely to resemble the pimply slightly overweight figure described in Kings novel and her efforts to look downcast and withdrawn strain credulity at first. Still the actress is canny and sympathetic enough that she eventually slips under Carries skin (in a way the high-school mini-revenge drama she enacted in ""Kick-Ass 2"" was excellent training). And when she puts on that dress and strolls into the prom on the arm of handsome Tommy Ross (Ansel Elgort) its hard not to feel a rush of bittersweet emotion as well as anticipatory dread as this Cinderella story proceeds to go terribly wrong. What happens next is a letdown The prom fiasco feels less like an explosion of teenage id than a snazzy visual-effects showreel; the climactic setpieces are borrowed directly from the 1976 version; and the denouement is pretty limp especially when compared with De Palmas literally groundbreaking kicker. Its a disappointing wrap-up to a movie that at its infrequent best suggests theres more than one way to adapt a classic. The supporting-cast standout is Judy Greer putting a nicely down-to-earth spin on the part of the gym teacher who takes a friendly interest in Carrie. Tech package is fine but undistinguished; Steve Yedlins underlit widescreen images serves the pictures attempt to conjure a mundane present-day reality but still feel a bit too nondescript but the film would have benefited from much bolder more extreme musical treatment than is supplied by Marco Beltramis score.

Kaye Dunglison says October 19 2013 at 315 pm I saw Carrie grabbing Sue in her nightmare as the price Sue would pay for her part in initial torment of Carrie. True justice....... living with your own guilt Reply Stephanie Stephens says October 19 2013 at 304 pm Look Stephen King is always underdone on film. And as for your referring to Carries hand bursting through the grave to grab Sue as ""De Palmas literally groundbreaking kicker""... It was the most irritating part of the original film having nothing to do with the novel and purely for shock value. I for one look forward to this version as well as any translation of Stephen Kings works. Reply LOL says October 18 2013 at 1053 am Bro this movie is crap. Shouldve got a man to direct it. Reply halloween Queen says October 19 2013 at 118 pm Men are OVERRATED Reply Mrs. Horror Boom (HorrorBoom.com) says October 18 2013 at 606 am Reblogged this on HORROR BOOM and commented Sounds like they did the best they could... but the original is a very very tough act to follow. Reply The Other ""Other"" Steve McQueen... Steve McQueeney says October 17 2013 at 348 pm http//www.lennonmurdertruth.com/ Carrie didnt know what Steve L. knows... But Steven K. should write a story about himself is it fiction or is it FACT? Or does someone walk around on a Lightfoot?... Carrie Carrie quite Contrary in a work of fiction. From Sissy Spacek to Chloe Moretz writing is Mr. Kings addiction Reply cadavra says October 17 2013 at 341 pm FYI there was also a made-for-TV remake in 2002 so this is technically the third filmed version of the story. Reply Cherie says October 19 2013 at 1238 pm Yes there was another remake I was wondering why they left that out. I bought it by mistake. Wasnt happy didnt watch. The Rage really wasnt a horrible movie. It wasnt a remake. I refuse to watch either of the 2 ""Carrie"" remakes. Original is best Reply pagetflorence says October 17 2013 at 324 pm Reblogged this on My Blog. Reply Brad Barnes (BradBarnes17) says October 17 2013 at 145 pm Judy Greer was also excellent in THE DESCENDENTS as the betrayed wife railing over George Clooneys comatose spouse bringing pathos to a story that had been running on ennui up till then.
