Directed by Phillip Noyce from a screenplay by Christopher Hampton and Robert Schenkkan based on the novel by Graham Greene. 100 minutes. Rated R for images of violence and some language. Metro and Uptown. Phillip Noyces ""The Quiet American"" glides along exquisitely like a boat in the indigo twilight of a Saigon river. Set in a 1950s Vietnam that is in turn dreamily nostalgic and hellishly violent its both a quiet little story about a love triangle and an eerily prescient metaphor for subsequent American involvement in Vietnam. You can watch it on either of those levels or you can simply get caught in the moody elegant lighting of Christopher Doyles masterful cinematography (those boats on the river glow like pearls). Noyce whose equally lovely ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" was released last month has suddenly emerged from a string of big-budget Hollywood movies (""Clear and Present Danger"" ""The Saint"" ""The Bone Collector"") as an artist on top of his game. Graham Greenes 1955 novel (previously made into a movie in 1958) is both romance and thriller thick with lush humid atmosphere. Thomas Fowler (Michael Caine) is a British foreign correspondent comfortably settled in Vietnam with a beautiful young mistress Phuong (Do Hai Yen) and a devil-may-care attitude toward work. (In the movie we see him enjoying a leisurely cup of tea outside the Continental Hotel at 11 a.m. -- before visiting the office.) The novel and the movie are both told in flashbacks; we watch Fowler as he learns of the death of ""the quiet American"" -- his friend and romantic rival Alden Pyle (Brendan Fraser) -- and listen as he retells the story of their acquaintance. Pyle a young idealist from Boston -- he wears his Red Sox cap in a North Vietnamese war zone -- has an aw-shucks demeanor. In the country to help launch an economic-aid program hes one of those Americans who are ""causing a lot of trouble"" as a French police inspector (Rade Sherbedgia) darkly notes. (Vietnam was then a French colony though the country fought for independence in the north.) Fowler at first befriends the eager young man then is dismayed when Pyle falls in love with Phuong. In a telling scene Pyle compares Phuong to Vietnam itself -- a beauty yet the helpless mistress of an older European man. Its a political story -- and an uncannily timely one -- yet the politics fade into the background in the wake of Caines complex and splendid performance. Hes a quiet Englishman a contented man who eyes the lovely Phuong with a mixture of pride condescension and mute adoration. ""I just got her started on Bach"" Fowler tells Pyle retelling his own Pygmalion story as he flashes a quick almost embarrassed smile. Fowler is no hero yet the basic decency that Caine has made a hallmark of his career shines through his impassive face. To lose Phuong he says with a quiet aching sincerity would be ""the beginning of death."" The often-underrated Fraser contributes a deceptively simple skillful characterization; hes perfectly cast with his big American face looming above his broad shoulders. And Do Hai Yen does what she can with a role as reed-slim as she is; its no easy trick playing a metaphor but she has a lovely presence. As sentimental 50s cafe music plays in the nightclubs of Saigon Caines eyes meet hers from across the room and its electric in a quiet way. So is this movie.

Michael Caine in Phillip Noyces ""The Quiet American."" Photo Phil Bray Quiet not quite an epic / But sharp direction acting boost film 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Quiet American Drama. Starring Michael Caine Brendan Fraser and Do Thi Hai Yen. Directed by Phillip Noyce. (R. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Michael Caines understated performance is the highlight of this adaptation of Graham Greene s novel about a cynical British journalist and an idealistic American who meet in 1950s Vietnam then known as French Indochina. Caine is the cynical Brit of course and his face in close-up tells his story alone Hes seen a lot of human nature in action enough to make anyone want to ""hide behind a typewriter."" The movie itself is a more mixed affair. There are ambitious ideas about the ambiguity of morals and the ease with which decent people can be corrupted. But in fact right and wrong still look pretty obvious here and the characters seem eminently corruptible. Phillip Noyce directs the film with the gravity and sprawl of an epic and the setting and the subject deserve that. But the story comes up thin and in the end seems more like an anecdote. Still this is a smart and literate effort that despite some weaknesses in overall conception has one undeniable virtue Theres not a single weak scene. The pace may seem dreamy and the plot may seem elliptical but thats a clever illusion. In fact Noyce and screenwriters Christopher Hampton and Robert Schenkkhan are constantly pushing the story forward point by point moment by moment. Related Stories Quiet American not quite an epic / But sharp direction acting boost film There are two distinct visual worlds in ""The Quiet American"" a Saigon depicted in fuzzy burnt amber tones and the hyperreal blue and green battlefields of the North. As the film begins Fowler (Caine) is a Saigon creature an older European with a young Vietnamese mistress who spends part of each day in a cafe and does amazingly little work in his job as a London Times correspondent. In his jaded but amiable way Fowler becomes intrigued by Pyle (Brendan Fraser) an American physician who has come to Vietnam to save its people from a curable but dangerous eye disease. Pyle in turn becomes intrigued by Fowlers mistress Phuong (Do Thi Hai Yen). Because hes young and single while Fowler is old and married Pyle becomes convinced that he has more to offer her. The love triangle is played for a bit more than its worth in terms of its larger implications about Vietnam Europe and America. Part of the problem may be the casting of Fraser. The role seems to call for a dangerously idealistic fellow whose can-do spirit and good intentions are ultimately a menace but Frasers presence suggests an awareness of darker motives and impulses. Hes the 21st century quiet American not the quiet American circa 1950. At the center of the triangle Do Thi Hai Yen wisely doesnt play Phuong as an abstraction. Working with very little dialogue -- most of which is merely mild or obsequious -- she yet manages to lend Phuong a watchful subtle insolence. She has no power; her fate is not her own but shes smarter than both these guys and she knows it. Noyces low-key approach has its drawbacks. When Fowler says that losing Phuong would be to him ""the beginning of death"" it comes as a surprise. Conversely anyone who wants to see a demonstration of the virtues of subtlety need only watch the remarkable scene in which Fowler sits in the cafe watching the street in the seconds leading up to an act of terrorist sabotage. Somehow Noyce lets us know that something is amiss but how? We know it even before Fowler becomes uneasy. Then -- out of nowhere -- disaster Explosions rock the fuzzy amber square and Saigon suddenly has the blue-death look of the North. The war has moved south. This is a sequence to play over and over in film classes. Ultimately the war becomes a force that cant be denied the big evil fact that all the characters must accommodate. Theyre presented with choices that leave them damned if they do and damned if they dont -- or at least thats what the movie would have us believe. Yet for all its elegance ""The Quiet American"" isnt convincing on that one crucial moral point. The right choices remain clear cut and the man who ultimately chooses wrong is no victim of circumstance but the victim of his own smallness. This film contains sexual situations and graphic violence.

The Quiet American is fast mythically uneasy and brilliantly acted. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Jan. 31 2003 123 PM The Sweaty Englishman The Quiet American is fast mythically uneasy and brilliantly acted. By David Edelstein Fraser and Caine in the murk of Vietnam Its hard to imagine a tighter more gripping adaptation of Graham Greenes 1955 novel The Quiet American than Philip Noyces new movie (Miramax) from a screenplay by Christopher Hampton. The story of Fowler (Michael Caine) an aging English foreign correspondent in Saigon who develops a strangely affectionate enmity for an idealistic young American named Pyle (Brendan Fraser) the film is a classical piece of work swiftly and evocatively told with a fair amount of narration in the first half but mounting dramatic concision (and dread) thereafter. Sans credits it runs less than 90 minutes and Noyce doesnt waste a frame. Thats what makes the movie a grabber and thats what slightly diminishes its impact There isnt a lot of time for Greenes worldview to sink in. Greene didnt have an ideological ax to grind when he wrote the book between 1952 and 1955--which might be why he made the case against American intervention in Vietnam with such amazing prescience. He had no love for the homegrown Communist forces--the Viet Minh--amassing in the North but he saw them (wrongly but understandably) as the least of evils more in touch with the needs of the people than the brutally inept French colonialists and less likely to commit atrocities than the megalomaniacal and anti-democratic military leaders with whom the Americans managed with the best of intentions to ally themselves. Advertisement As was Greenes bent he told the story through the prism of a love triangle. The cynical reporter and the romantic American compete for Fowlers mistress a silken Vietnamese beauty named Phuong (played onscreen--somewhat inertly--by Do Thi Hai Yen); and the struggle over the woman is meant to echo the struggle for Vietnam. Although the parallel somewhat objectifies both Phuong and her country Greene was aware of his restricted vantage. Representing old Europe (with a Catholic wife back home who wont divorce him) Greenes alter ego is honest about his sexual and emotional selfishness and Phuongs limited options and just as blunt in his assessment of her people ""They want enough rice. They dont want to be shot at. They want one day to be much the same as another. They dont want our white skins around telling them what they want."" What troubles Fowler (and Greene) is Pyles view of himself as a savior--a view thats rooted not in knowledge of Phuong or Vietnam but in post-World War II chivalric egoism and the writings of a (fictional) author called York Harding who calls for a ""Third Force"" to counter both colonialism and communism. The quiet American who seems to be behind the supply of plastic explosives to a despotic general named The is the most ingratiating villain imaginable ""He was as incapable of imagining pain or danger to himself as he was incapable of conceiving the pain he might cause others."" Both the novel and the film open with the discovery of Pyles murdered body then flash back to the events that led to his killing. Its no mystery given its modulated but firm anti-Americanism why The Quiet American went unreleased for a year after Sept. 11. If anything the movies launch on the eve of an invasion with Iraq could be even touchier--or would be if its political dimension were allowed to breathe. As it stands we dont hear enough about Pyles passionate belief in the Third Force and a lot of the Gen. The material simply whizzes by. Youd need to have read the novel to understand whats happening when Fowler watches two American women hurriedly leave a public square before an explosion set by Thes men. And Hampton and Noyce barrel through the books most gripping chapter in which Fowler and Pyle find themselves out of gas and trapped in one of the hideously vulnerable watchtowers on the road between the north and Saigon opposite two young and scared recruits. That said whats in the film is well-nigh perfect. That watchtower looks haunted in the fading light and the shots of Saigon at night with its sampans drifting lyrically in the foreground and the mortar flashes on the horizon have a mythic beauty and unease. The scenes of carnage are staged and shot--in agonized slow motion--to register the obscenity of ""collateral damage"" of ends valued over means when the means are the ravaged limbless bodies of men women and children. As conceived by Greene and Hampton Pyle is dramatically uninteresting and probably unplayable. Someone like a young Sean Penn might have found a creative back door to the characters shallowness--but it beats me where it would be. Fraser is good though--better than youve heard. Hes a buoyant actor who cant help stylizing Pyles sincerity (think Christopher Reeves Clark Kent) but he doesnt condescend to the character. His Pyle is a man with enormous sympathy and zero empathy He wanders through the landscape like a man (in Greenes words) ""impregnably armored by his good intentions and his ignorance."" Michael Caine was the right age for Fowler when he played a version of the same part in the much underrated 1983 adaptation of Greenes The Honorary Consul senselessly retitled Beyond the Limit. But it scarcely matters that hes a few years too old for the role He has grown into one of the finest film actors of all time and his Fowler is an understated masterpiece. No one sweats through a role the way Caine does You can see his characters simultaneous terror of losing Phuong and his struggle to remain aloof in Caines pores in the position of his head in the light or the dimness of his eyes. Caine makes Hamptons too-literary narration work by playing it as an inner dialogue Its the best performance of narration Ive ever heard. It makes you want to hear Caine read the whole book--or read anything. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Credit Michael Caine for Miramaxs decision to open the second screen version of Graham Greenes 1955 novella in New York; Washington D.C.; Salt Lake City; and Denver today before the films general release in February. Its an odd geographical mix for standard late-year Oscar consideration but at least moviegoers in those cities will be impressed by Caines subtle performance as a British journalist who has both personal and political interest in a metaphoric American meddler into 1952 Vietnamese politics (Brendan Fraser). Review of the movie The Quiet American Though several plot specifics coincide this rendering is far superior to the 1958 predecessor by Joseph L. Mankiewicz occasionally shown on Turner Classic Movies. It was the first serious stumble for a director who had won back-to-back Oscars in 49 and 50 (A Letter to Three Wives and All About Eve). Fraser has it all over the originals Audie Murphy as a Saigon-based American helping to prop up a military leader who may offer an alternative to French and Ho Chi Minh forces in their Indo-Chinese standoffs. Fraser makes his character appropriately callow but not (like Murphy) dully so. Whats more this version can be far more upfront (as no watered-down 58 movie could) about the Fraser characters CIA connections. This is intelligent grown-up entertainment on both a political and a humanistic level though its convoluted November-vs.-February release pattern probably wont matter much at the box office. Had this movie been released in the late 60s or early 70s it would have been a factor with anti-war cutting-edge audiences. Today it will likely disappear though Caines sympathetic characterization (jaded but not overly judgmental) may keep limited video copies on shelves for a while at least in upscale markets.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

Just as Graham Greenes characters usually manage to drag themselves (by the chin if necessary and often contrary to everything they refuse to believe) over the threshold of the sanctuary into a state of real or partial -- and usually highly compromised -- redemption so filmmakers are returning to Greene himself and trying to do right by him the better to redeem the perceived sins of their cinematic forebears. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Greene was probably right to feel hed been hard done by on film. When he himself was behind the typewriter things usually went smoothly and the results -- Carol Reeds The Third Man and The Fallen Idol and Alberto Cavalcantis anti-Mrs. Miniver home-front melodrama Went the Day Well? -- are easily the most memorable films taken from his work. However the list of inadequate bad or even treacherous adaptations of his novels is a long and depressing one. Perhaps most famously there is the movie that really soured Greenes view of Hollywood Joseph Mankiewiczs 1958 adaptation of his novel of the early years of the Vietnam conflict The Quiet American whose ending was re-jigged in such a way as to betray utterly Greenes ideas about the geopolitical morass of Southeast Asia. Filmmakers today knowing the hash their predecessors often made of Greene the first time out approach his work clad in the penitents sackcloth the scourge ever at hand lest they feel tempted to mess with the Word. In remaking The End of the Affair a couple of years ago Neil Jordan devoutly abased himself before Greenes shrine yet wound up with exactly the same problems as Edward Dmytryks 1955 version Jordans movie is finally a superior Cliffs Notes to a probably unfilmable novel. Now Phillip Noyce returning to his left-wing political roots and a tight budget after a decade of expensive right-wingish Tom Clancy adaptations has attempted to make up for what Mankiewicz wrought. Greene wrote the novel after spending four winters in Vietnam between 1951 and 1954 as a correspondent for Life and Londons Sunday Times. Famous for its local accuracy and political prescience the novel became an essential component of 1960s journalists education in the roots of the Vietnam conflict. Its central character an aging cynical English journalist named Thomas Fowler (Michael Caine) becomes friendly with the uncharacteristically quiet American Alden Pyle (Brendan Fraser) a well-scrubbed innocent supposedly in the employ of the American Legation but actually a CIA operative. Then Pyle lays eyes on Fowlers Vietnamese mistress Phuong (beautiful newcomer Do Thi Hai Yen) and soon announces quite baldly that he intends to remove her from the care of her unworthy protector and steer her toward a richer freer life as the future Mrs. Pyle in some small New England town where ""even the celery comes wrapped in cellophane.""

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm Fowler in fact is a kind of enhanced stand-in for the famously disreputable and libidinous Greene He drinks smokes opium daily keeps a pliable mistress and knows the names of all the French porno mags. Pyle though Greene always denied it is derived from the famous OSS/CIA operative Colonel Edward Lansdale who like Pyle was responsible for backing a violent ""third force"" neither colonialist nor communist in the emerging conflict. When we first encounter Pyle hes dead of stab wounds and the movie like the novel circles back to the first encounter between the two men. It witnesses the decline of their unlikely friendship into a sexual rivalry for the passive (""Sometimes she seemed invisible like peace"") but pragmatic Phuong which mirrors the three-way struggle for the soul of the country. When Fowler finally accepts a measure of political involvement and betrays Pyle to the communists -- outwardly at least in disgust at the bloodshed Pyle has caused in his role as a terrorist for Democracy -- his motives are powerfully adulterated by sexual jealousy. Its an archetypal Greene construction -- the rack on which he breaks his luckless creations a delicate cats cradle of interlocking hostilities and mixed motives filled with mirror images and polar opposites. Fowler is a man detached a nonbeliever Pyle a Christian a committed innocent a virgin at 32 -- ""an unmistakably young and unused face flung at us"" writes Greene ""like a dart."" Caine is about 15 years too old to play Fowler but his weary disdainful performance (loosely modeled says the actor on Greene himself) amply anchors the movie. Frasers Pyle is less successful though this has much to do with Greenes flawed and stereotypical characterization (for Greenes generation of Englishmen whether on the left or the right the adjective ""American"" was less spoken than expectorated). Looking oddly like his frozen-in-time character in Blast From the Past Fraser in his boxy best-and-brightest suit his sleeves-up can-do Walt Rostow fanaticism and especially his buzzcut and spectacles seems to be modeled after 60s U.S. Defense Secretary Robert McNamara. Fraser makes a brave attempt at a character played weighed down by political/symbolic freight and by Greenes evident distaste for American culture and influence but finally he is a Canadian in a role that absolutely demands an American. For all his limitations as an actor Audie Murphy Mankiewiczs Pyle brought with him an immensely evocative set of associations -- he was a war hero then a star of Westerns -- and his earnest face was a tabula rasa on which anything could be read. Shot in Saigon by Hong Kong-based Australian cinematographer Chris Doyle Noyces remake certainly looks beautiful although Mankiewicz had the undoubted advantage of filming there before the Vietnamese phoenix (""phuong"") had fallen into the furnace or risen from the rubble. Any Australian of Noyces age has friends who died in Vietnam (because unlike Britain Australia allowed itself to be browbeaten by LBJ into sending troops) so there is no doubting his commitment to the material and to preserving Greenes baleful vision. He has made a good-looking intelligent stab at the novel mildly undermined by a tendency to seek contemporary relevance including a redundant montage of Fowlers supposed dispatches between 1952 when the novel ends and 1965 when the U.S. Marines arrived. No doubt the American right will have a field day disinterring then re-burying Greene and his powerful demolition of American adventurism but if The Quiet American stirs fresh debate about the unintended consequences of intervention abroad it will have served its purpose admirably. Pierce Brosnan as James Bond IF WE DEMANDED FROM FILMMAKERS THE SAME fidelity to Ian Flemings novels that we ask of those tackling Greenes the results might really depress us. First up the booze. Just count the snifters James Bond chugs in chapter one of Goldfinger four double bourbons two double martinis and a foaming pint of pink champagne. License To Kill? They wouldnt give this guy a License To Piss Unassisted. As for knocking combat boots with mocha-licious Halle Berry in the new Bond a.k.a. Die Another Day well try this from Live and Let Die ""The Chigroes have all the venality of the Chinaman and all the brutishness of the Negro."" Guess that puts paid to Michelle Yeoh as well. A revisionist Bond movie then might imagine him at age 55 in about 1975 empurpled by strong drink given to frequent and splenetic fulminations against the unions the Labour Party the Jews and the wogs and involved in one of those semi-clandestine and wholly ridiculous private armies of ex-spies and SAS officers that briefly flourished in paranoid mid-70s England. Director Lee Tamahori (Once Were Warriors Along Came a Spider) hasnt gone that far (or that crazy) though in Die Another Day he does fill the screen with witty nods to 40 years of Bond movies Berrys Jinx emerges from the Cuban surf in an orange version of Ursula Andress famous bikini-and-fish-knife combo in Dr. No and later undergoes a little old-school (well Gold-school) laser surgery. The Aston Martin is back (that Beamer was a sacrilege) and its invisible which is pretty neat. Et cetera. All thats missing are a piranha pool and blokes with lethal hats and golden guns. The result is the niftiest Bond movie in years -- fresh funny and jammed to the rafters with demented stunts Boys-Own gadgetry and brazen promiscuity. Tamahori shoots and cuts action like a pro but he also has a surprisingly lyrical eye and sees to it that his actors are fully developed characters not just insertable-subtractible ciphers to fill villain- and babe-shaped holes on the screen. Purists and Bond-bores may bemoan the occasional computer-generated effects but the rest of us will be glad to see the Bond-wagon trouncing its many action-movie imitators for the first time in years.

The country looks timelessly serene and sensual but its all about to blow of course and everything duplicitous and naive is contained within the hooded personal agendas of a tired British journalist a fresh-faced American on a mission and a graceful young Vietnamese woman loved by both men. The story belongs to Thomas Fowler (Michael Caine) a calloused veteran London Times correspondent and the exhausted opposite of a hungry newshound Happy to be away from his unsatisfying marriage to a woman back in England who wont divorce him (this is Greene country after all) Fowler relishes his routines of leisure and most of all enjoys the company of his young Vietnamese mistress Phuong (Do Thi Hai Yen). But the arrival of Alden Pyle (Brendan Fraser) a hearty handshake of a fellow ostensibly on the scene to run a medical aid program changes all that. While the can-do gung ho American establishes a friendship with the end-of-the-empire Brit he also falls in love with Phuong and makes a play for her. (Also hes not quite the administrative envoy he appears.) Geopolitical history is thus enveloped in a love story a murder mystery and a spy story about something big. The actors know it too. Caine makes his towering performance look casual; Fraser gets to exercise the strong serious chops he hasnt had call to display since ""Gods and Monsters."" ""The Quiet American"" is a disquieting story intently critical not only of the United States involvement in Vietnam but also of aggressive forward-thrusting U.S.-ness in general; for this reason theres been studio hemming and hawing about when to release the picture. Well nows fine thanks. Surely audiences for a serious literary thriller are able to appreciate superior filmmaking and are unthreatened by psychological discomfort (or indeed by the weight of sorrow that lingers decades after U.S. troops left Vietnam). Besides the blame is pretty well distributed all around. Noyces movie works because the director (who previously juggled thrills and political intrigue in ""Patriot Games"" and ""Clear and Present Danger"") trusts himself and his audience to understand that catastrophe isnt always a matter of loud ideology. Rather its the result of age-old human weakness. And sometimes its quiet.
