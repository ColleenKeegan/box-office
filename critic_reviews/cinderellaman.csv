Its not that everyones heard of James J. Braddock (Russell Crowe) the scrappy heavyweight from New Jersey whose rise and fall and rise made him a working-class hero in the depths of the Depression--the symbolic equivalent of a two-legged Seabiscuit. What we do all know is that Hollywoods not about to make a sports movie with this title that doesnt have a happy ending.Ultimately it doesnt matter that we can see the third act coming or that ""Cinderella Man"" doesnt have an original bone in its well-oiled body or even that the first logy hour feels dangerously generic. Once Braddock--the rundown wreck of a boxer whos reduced to begging to support his family--begins his astonishingly unlikely comeback Howards movie skillfully delivers that primal heart-pounding satisfaction that is the promise of all boxing tales.Howard directs this rousing saga with an admirable sense of restraint taking his cue from Braddock himself a decent conscientious family man who wasnt given to histrionic display. Even when provoked in public by his rival the heavyweight champ Max Baer (Craig Bierko) Braddock doesnt take the macho bait but defuses the situation with humor. Crowe sporting an altered nose and crinkly eyes that call to mind the young Ronald Reagan develops a quiet instantaneous rapport with both the audience and with Renee Zellweger who plays his devoted wife Mae. If Cliff Hollingsworth and Akiva Goldsmans screenplay idealizes their marriage Zellweger has an uncanny ability to make us swallow even the most movie-ish moments. A delightfully scene-stealing Paul Giamatti plays Braddocks wily manager Joe Gould who stuck by him even after Braddock had his fighters license revoked. Funny and touching Giamatti shows us the raw excitable emotions that keep breaking the surface of Goulds fast-talking tough-guy facade. These were all real people but the movie invents Braddocks dockworker pal Mike (Paddy Considine) a poverty-stricken stockbroker turned bitter political activist and he seems like a well-intended but awkward afterthought. As a history lesson (Depression 101) ""Cinderella Man"" feels a bit secondhand. As a true-grit tale of redemption however it lands one solid body punch after another.

Offered a second chance as the pugilistic patsy in a no-win fight against an up-and-comer Braddock chose to rewrite the script his against-the-odds comeback culminating with his winning the world heavyweight crown in 1935. Reteaming with his A Beautiful Mind star Ron Howard pumps the too-good-to-be-true narrative for all its triumphant emotional worth scoring a points victory despite the heavy emphasis on family values and easy mythologising - in contrast to Raging Bulls Jake La Motta for instance Braddock has no dark side; a demon in the ring hes a virtual saint outside it. Yet Crowe in a wonderfully measured performance that flexes both his muscles and acting chops plays him determined and resilient tempering the heroics with an earnestness that keeps Braddock halfway human. Renee Zellweger lends fine support as his plucky wife Mae standing by her man (but never ringside) and the marvellous Paul Giamatti brings zip to his role as Braddocks coach. Howard meanwhile curtails his melodramatic tendencies enough to fashion a handsomely crafted piece of old-school entertainment that his DoP bathes throughout in a rich poetic light. The fight scenes have a stinging authenticity and although at 144 minutes it outstays its welcome this is Howards best film since Apollo 13.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Credit George Kraychyk 2005 Universal Studios less CINDERELLA03 RUSSELL CROWE portrays Jim Braddock who entered the boxing ring to provide for his family during the Great Depressionand became a national hero along the wayin Cinderella Man. PAUL GIAMATTI ... more Howards knockout film is no Cinderella fairy tale 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Cinderella Man Drama. Starring Russell Crowe Paul Giamatti and Renee Zellweger. Directed by Ron Howard. (PG-13. 144 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Cinderella Man"" should settle any lingering perception of Ron Howard as a sentimental director. From its opening scenes he gets into the ring with this film about heavyweight boxer James J. Braddock and starts throwing punches. His movie full of Great Depression grit and harsh boxing sequences is an unflinching and historically rich rendering of an amazing story. He has made what is easily the best American film so far this year. He could have told the story of Braddock dubbed the ""Cinderella Man"" by Damon Runyon as the usual inspirational saga. Howard chooses instead to tell it more as a tale of poverty embarrassment and deep life disappointment -- except he doesnt quite do that either. Mainly Howard approaches the film as the story of a husband and wife struggling day by day to keep three children clothed and fed during the Depression. Everything flows from that. The movie documents individual triumphs but the triumphs are not presented as personal triumphs of self-realization and ego -- the usual movie thing -- but as monumental tasks achieved in the service of humble necessity. Has there ever been a boxing movie that did more to remind people that boxing can lead to permanent injury or death? Noses shatter and blood flows as though this were a Scorsese movie. Likewise ""Cinderella Man"" never stops warning of the consequences of poverty Broken families criminal activity hunger unheated apartments colds that can turn into pneumonia. ""Cinderella Man"" is no Pollyanna piece but a film in which the potential for disaster is real and ever present. As in life success is experienced not so much as victory but as blessed relief. And to think things start out so well for these people. Its 1928 when we first meet Braddock (Russell Crowe) a heavyweight contender known as the ""Bulldog of Bergen."" He has a settled middle-class life in New Jersey a clever wife (Renee Zellweger) and the likelihood of a title shot in the near future. Hes an emerging star in an era in which everybody looks like a million bucks -- and then in the blink of an eye its 1933 and everybody looks hung over. Braddock has lost his house and his money in the stock market crash of 1929. He and his family are living in a cellar apartment -- practically a shack -- and hes working as a day laborer on the docks. His heavyweight career is over. Hes just another boxer who almost happened but didnt. Boxing movies are almost always about men striving to prove their mettle ostensibly to the world but really to themselves. But Crowe gives us something different. In one of the first scenes Braddock returns home after winning a fight and hes not hyper not wound up just relaxed. It hardly seems possible but as we soon see this equanimity is the key to his character. Its what allows him to face lifes reversals without surrendering to despair or wildly insisting on his own self-worth. For Braddock his self-worth is never in question but neither is it an issue of any special significance. Thus a seemingly simple guy emerges as an intriguing character the rare case of a man who knows who he is and whats important. Crowes understanding of this character is complete and his performance outstanding. Zellweger makes someone quirky and specific of Mrs. Braddock and even the minor players are presented in psychological detail. Craig Bierko appears in only a handful of scenes as heavyweight champion Max Baer but we get a complicated impression of him. In a sense hes the movies villain a ladies man a braggart a bully and a show-off whose qualities are in stark contrast to those of Braddock. But theres a look in his eyes He comes from Braddocks world another poor kid who made good. Best of all theres Paul Giamatti as Joe Gould Braddocks manager and trainer a yapping ankle-biter with a soul and the one man youd want in your corner if you were fighting for the title. The humor and the humanity of Giamattis performance cant be parsed. Its just a beautiful thing. In look ""Cinderella Man"" provides a one-way ticket to the early 1930s. Its not just a matter of getting the cars and the clothes right but of putting people in exactly the right cars and the right clothes and of making the settings grubby and lived-in so that it looks like hard times and not a theme park. The home interiors are Victorian -- of course they would be. It takes money to stay up to date. Its only when the Braddocks step into a nightclub does it look like the glamorous 1930s of a ""Thin Man"" movie and even then theres still a whiff of the outside. And when people talk their New York and New Jersey accents are of a kind we dont quite hear anymore. Such a detailed effort goes above and beyond whats necessary. Love went into this. -- Advisory This film contains boxing violence.

Directed by Ron Howard from a screenplay by Cliff Hollingsworth and Akiva Goldsman. 138 minutes. Rated PG-13 for intense boxing violence and some language. Several theaters. Theres a faint film of dust over Ron Howards boxing drama ""Cinderella Man"" just enough to show us that what we have here is an antique and a rather lovely one at that. Howard that most old-fashioned of contemporary Hollywood filmmakers has settled into a style that suits him noble characters sweeping music stories of good folk triumphing in the dusty light. And here hes found a story (scripted by Cliff Hollingsworth and Akiva Goldsman) that perfectly fits that style. Depression-era boxer Jim Braddock it turns out had a life that sounds exactly like a Ron Howard movie. A working-class family man from New Jersey Braddock had some success as a pro boxer in the 1920s but his career faltered with the arrival of the Depression. Impoverished and desperate to support his family of five Braddock began to box again despite a badly injured hand and his worried wifes disapproval. One bout led to another a folk-hero image was formed and in 1935 Braddock -- now known as Cinderella Man for his fairy-tale return to the spotlight -- found himself facing heavyweight champion Max Baer for the title at a packed Madison Square Garden with millions of fans listening on their radios. Cant you see the movie already with Russell Crowe as the noble boxer and Renee Zellweger as his beloved wife Mae and Thomas Newmans music welling up in the background like aggressively pretty wallpaper? Howards version will surprise nobody; its almost like watching an old movie that you vaguely remember seeing before. But its beautifully acted and skillfully made and even skeptics may find themselves getting caught up in the action in spite of themselves. Crowe in particular has rarely been more appealing; taking a too-good-to-be-true scripted character and creating a breathing laughing real man. He looks thinner than usual here (as befits a Depression character who gives the extra food to his children) but has a playful sparkle; he knows who he is. Crowe always looks like the biggest man on screen even when he isnt; hes got a big presence and a charm that he easily flicks on and off. Braddock is motivated by pride and Crowe conveys that without ever going too far. In one scene the boxer desperate to pay bills passes his hat among the men of the boxing commission. Crowes body is tense and he never makes eye contact with the men who toss in coins; his jaw is set tight and he doesnt thank them. Because of the actors toughness the moment escapes sentimentality. Later when Braddock is offered a chance to earn 250 in a questionable bout the tightness suddenly eases. ""For 250 Id fight your wife"" he cheerfully tells his manager. And because that manager Joe Gould is played by Paul Giamatti (the wine-loving writer in ""Sideways"") the two emerge as the movies key relationship. Theres nothing whatsoever wrong with Zellwegers performance; shes all glowing sweetness and believably so. But Mae is one of those big-movie noble-wife roles that gives Zellweger virtually nothing to do (except for a pre-fight pep talk in which she manages to make the line ""You are the champion of my heart"" not sound cloying) and we tend to forget about her when shes off-screen. Giamatti as Joe is the wild card in this otherwise by-the-book boxing drama; his character is the only one that we cant quite get an instant read on. With dark circles under his eyes he always looks like hes holding something back. If the strapping Braddock is an open book Joe is a locked drawer. (The Depression affected these men in different ways; in a startling scene in an elegant apartment we learn a bit of what Joe is hiding.) But the men spark off each other; not really friends but partners in an endeavor that both desperately need. The boxing scenes with Giamatti fluttering around Crowe like a nervous moth are staged economically and effectively with sickening crunches and blurry shots that convey Braddocks disorientation. ""Cinderella Man"" is made with confidence and sincerity; its a good movie about good people viewed through a sepia kaleidoscope of sweet-natured nostalgia. (This Depression is just a bit picturesque with Zellweger often looking like she just emerged from some tenement beauty salon.) Pardon its dust and youll be rewarded with a moving story of a time gone by and of an unexpected hero.

For the second time in two years in back-to-back releases the Aussie actor has lent heavyweight heft to a movie making it more interesting than it otherwise would be. Crowe accomplished this feat in 2003 with Peter Weirs ""Master and Commander The Far Side of the World"" when he played Capt. Jack Aubrey. Now he steps into the ring to punch up with captivating finesse director Ron Howards sepia-tinted valentine to boxer James Braddock dubbed the ""Cinderella Man"" when he began a slow steady climb back into the ring. He faced the heavyweight champion Max Baer on June 13 1935. Braddocks success roared in the early 1920s then collapsed as stunningly as the stock market in 1929. He couldnt overcome a broken right hand lost a bout to light heavyweight Tommy Loughran and had his license yanked by the boxing commission. Promoter Jimmy Johnston (Bruce McGill) treats Braddock as a joke one no longer compelling enough to put fannies in seats. In the same way that ""Million Dollar Baby"" was far more than a boxing movie ""Cinderella Man"" also uses the ring and its brutal dance to ponder grander themes. Pummelled by bad luck and a national economic catastrophe the New Jersey pugilist once nicknamed ""The Bulldog of Bergen"" never forgot what mattered family. Its a boxing flick because boxing was the only skill he had to provide for his wife Mae and children. Renee Zellweger plays Mae. This isnt Zellwegers meatiest role. While she may not be long-suffering (Mae and Jims relationship is more generous than that) her stoicism reminds us of Zellweggers chatty gift. Crowes performance finds a better helpmate in Paul Giamatti who captures the smarm as well as the hidden decency of manager Joe Gould. One of the films finer scenes comes when Mae visits Joe whom she never quite liked at his swank address. As Howard states in the films production notes ""The story of Jim Braddock continues to be so incredibly stirring because its a tale that reminds us of just how remarkable human endurance and the power of love can be."" Howards version of poverty could have done with a bit more grit and grime if only to give contemporary relevancy to Braddocks endurance. Instead the films somber hues make desperation if not quite quaint a thing encased in amber. In ""Cinderella Man"" (written by Cliff Hollingworth and Akiva Goldsman) men abandon their responsibilities leaving wives yelling after them in the street. Jims dockworking friend Mike (Paddy Considine) slips into the bottle. Mae and the kids strip wood off the base of a billboard for kindling. But these moments meant to be edgy have the weirdly comfy feel of a parent or grandparents recollections. This sentimentality is the movies fundamental weakness - albeit one Crowe powers through. Deathly allergic to false notes Crowe doesnt overact. He brings an intensity that resembles something closer to underplaying. When Braddock stands in a restive crowd hoping to be picked for a dock job his eyes speak of the tipping point between pride and need. Once Braddock is offered a fight - mostly as a stunt gig - ""Cinderella Man"" finds a driving rhythm it maintains throughout the rest of the film. B-movie actor Craig Bierko gives a nasty edge to playboy boxer Max Baer. By the time Braddock and Baer met in the ring Baer had killed two opponents. For the role Bierko thickened his body nearly as much as Crowe solidified his. If you dont know the bouts outcome resist the urge to look it up. Madison Garden was packed that June night. Like the race of a certain underdog horse three years later the match captured the imagination of a nation of underdogs. Crowes performance as this Seabiscuit of the sweet science will no doubt make the middleweight ""Cinderella Man"" a contender - an Oscar contender.

YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Renee Zellweger Ron Howard Russell Crowe or Create your own Manage alerts | What is this? (CNN) -- From ""Apollo 13"" to ""A Beautiful Mind"" Ron Howard has been drawn to stories exploring heroism family fidelity and the strength of the human spirit.He continues in that vein with ""Cinderella Man"" the Depression-era story of boxer James J. Braddock called ""The Cinderella Man."" Braddock fueled by love for his family goes from abject poverty to achieving an impossible dream. Along the way he becomes an unlikely folk hero.The movie begins in 1928 when Braddock (Russell Crowe) a promising young New Jersey boxer is making a name for himself with the help of his trusted friend and manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti). Life is good Braddock brings in several hundred dollars with each win -- a fortune in those days -- and his family lives well.Then Braddock suffers a badly broken right hand and his world begins to fall apart. After a crushing defeat at the hands of light heavyweight champ Tommy Loughran the local boxing commission revokes his license.At the same time America is sliding into the Great Depression. Braddock his wife Mae (Renee Zellweger) and their three small children -- along with millions of other people -- suddenly found themselves barely able to survive.Now ""Cinderella Man"" becomes a story less about boxing but about the strength of the bonds between Mae and James. Her emotional support was his anchor.Comeback timeBraddock finds sporadic work in New Yorks shipyards but is unable to provide even the bare necessities -- milk gas or electricity -- for his family. Faced with the possibility that his children will be forced to live with relatives he applies for relief. This delivers a greater blow to Braddock then any punch he ever received in the ring.Then in 1934 Gould -- whos also stuck by Braddock -- begins to lay the groundwork for a great comeback. He arranges for Braddock to fight in a one-time-only match at Madison Square Garden. Old out of shape and hungry Braddock -- and the rest of the world -- thinks hes destined to go down. Instead he wins stunning everybody.Despite Maes pleas for him to stop he continues to fight and continues to win. His amazing re-emergence from underdog to contender captures the hearts and minds of millions of Americans. Sportswriter Damon Runyon gives Braddock the moniker of Cinderella Man.Finally Braddock faces off with Max Baer (Craig Bierko) the flamboyant heavyweight champion of the world. Baer packs a literally lethal punch -- the force of his blows has killed two other boxers.Heroic work Braddocks wife Mae (Renee Zellweger) is his rock during his fall and rise.In many ways youve seen ""Cinderella Man"" before. The boxing movie is a Hollywood mainstay; so is the comeback story. ""Rocky"" (1976) combined both to Oscar-winning glory and just two years ago ""Seabiscuit"" mined much of the same underdog territory on the horse tracks.But Howards keen eye for production design his skill at exposing raw emotion and the terrific acting abilities of Crowe and Zellweger put this movie way above most films of the genre. The casting is perfect. Everyone in supporting roles gives outstanding performances particulary Giamatti.The boxing scenes are so realistic theyre hard to watch. Using multiple cameras -- some hand-held -- Howard captures the sport in all its gory glory. Here again Crowes dedication to his art is truly remarkable. You can almost feel his pain.The script by Academy Award winner Akiva Goldsman -- based on a story by newcomer Cliff Hollingsworth who received a screenwriting credit -- is beautifully crafted. Hollingsworth had the cooperation of Braddocks two sons and the result is a glowing tribute to this forgotten hero.Some critics may knock this film for being overly sentimental and Howards no novice at pulling heartstrings. But I felt the director stopped just short of falling over the edge.

Knockout Russell Crowe is boxer Jimmy Braddock; Paul Giamatti is his manager. Universal Studios Ron Howards biopic of world heavyweight champ James J. Braddock like its 30s brother Seabiscuit from 2003 is a test case to see whether a prestige picture can be sold in the summer. (Cinderella surpasses Seabiscuit in every way.) Sparked by some of the most excitingly staged bouts and resonant ringside ""business"" ever it also fills a gap. (Related video Watch the Cinderella Man trailer) Everyone knows about Joe Louis and his famed 30s bouts with Max Schmeling. We know Primo Carnera because his fictionalized story became The Harder They Fall Humphrey Bogarts swan song. We know Max Baer because he acted in many films (including his unforgettable turn in Fall) and because Max Jr. played Jethro on The Beverly Hillbillies. About the movie Cinderella Man     (out of four) Stars Russell Crowe Renee Zellweger Paul Giamatti Craig Bierko Paddy Considine Bruce McGill Director Ron Howard Distributor Universal Running time 2 hours 24 minutes Rated PG-13 for intense boxing violence and some language Opens Friday nationwide But who was this Jimmy Braddock who intertwined with so many of these figures? A 1920s fighter of promising merit -- his fall in fortunes is conveyed in a brilliant transition -- he was a dock laborer by 1933 on the rare days he could find work. Renee Zellweger plays Braddocks wife trying to feed three kids in basically one room with no place to cry (except outside in the snow; that was the Depression for you). She has several strong scenes that the amazing Crowe also makes special. Let Crowe enter a nightspot in real life and the thoughts of many bartenders turn to bubble-wrapping the glassware. But on screen this master and commander projects sensitivity like no one else around. Paul Giamatti has a likable turn as Braddocks manager and Craig Bierko puts a superbly idiosyncratic spin on Baer a fatal puncher whose butchering of Carnera in a pre-Braddock bout still chills 70 years later. Champ Baer was a 20-to-1 favorite despite sweating booze during limited training. Mans climactic matchup which is far from the only long shot we see Braddock face during a miracle run for title contention works splendidly for two reasons. Theres so much on the line -- Braddocks mortality for one thing -- and the staging is breathtaking. Ive never seen a boxing movie that has so convinced me I was seeing a pro bout both real and sustained. Unlike many ex-champs Cinderella Braddocks stagecoach never changed into a pumpkin. And his movie is a Rolls.

"Cinderella Man All Bout Crowe washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On On Screen Cinderella Man All Bout Crowe Russell Crowe left utterly believable as the legendary boxer Jim Braddock faces a pounding from opponent Corn Griffin portrayed by heavyweight fighter Art Binkowski a current boxing star. (By George Kraychyk -- Universal Studios) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 3 2005 MAYBE ITS the claustrophobic intensity of the ring. Or possibly its the way a boxer has to pummel his (or her) way to glory in 12 puffy-eyed rounds. Maybe its the lore of the musty dressing room the prizefighter with down-turned head and the hard-bitten trainer. Whatever the reasons boxing lends itself spectacularly to watchable touching movies from John Garfields 1947 ""Body and Soul"" to last years ""Million Dollar Baby."" ""Cinderella Man"" doesnt sit on the ropes though. It re-earns glory in its own right. Ron Howards fable about Depression-era boxer Jim Braddock (played by Russell Crowe) is a powerful piece of Americana about a come-from-behind winner who makes a perfect metaphor for Americas down-but-not-out spirit of the times. Yes in a sense ""Cinderella"" is ""Seabiscuit"" in boxing gloves. But theres more to it than that a Runyonesque glow. And Crowes burly poignancy hits you foursquare in the ribs -- right above the ticker. This feels old-fashioned pure and meat-and-potatoes simple. Its an Irish stew movie. Jim J. Braddock a light heavyweight fighter boxes so his family can eat. Its that clear to him. His wife Mae (Renee Zellweger) cant stand watching him fight but she knows the money puts food on the table for her and the three children. So when Jim breaks his right hand in a fight taking time to heal is not an option. Not surprisingly he loses his next bout and begins a downward slide. Before long the Depression really hits and hes forced to scrounge work as a longshoreman jostling with other hungry desperate souls for a days gig. Loading freight isnt easy with a broken hand especially with a foreman keeping watch for slackers. But thanks to support from newfound workmate Mike (Paddy Considine) Jim manages to get by. But its not enough. Jim faces the shame of having his children sent to relatives because theres no electricity in the house. Jim has virtually no choice when his former manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti) offers 250 for a death-or-glory bout with a heavyweight whos sure to beat him. But if Jim wins he would suddenly find himself facing off with world champ Max Baer (Craig Bierko) who doesnt just win fights he kills people. Two fighters have already died in the ring under his vicious attacks. Howard and scriptwriters Cliff Hollingsworth and Akiva Goldsman work the story inch by human inch making you deeply aware of Jims agonizing progress -- not just in the ring but in a cold dark house with a hungry family. This is the creative team that gave you ""A Beautiful Mind"" and its clear they havent forgotten the one-two combinations to reprise that power again. What keeps ""Cinderella"" from complete hokiness is Crowes utterly believable performance. As Jim he measures his worth in simple terms making money for his own keeping his word and taking punishment without flinching. This is about manhood in the oldest and finest sense. And that makes things especially affecting when Jim listens to Max Baer insult him and his wife in a public place on the eve of the big fight. Everything Jim stands for is being insulted. But he knows the odds are against him and also that a scuffle would bring everything tumbling down. Crowe knows how to use his physique like Spencer Tracy Gerard Depardieu or Jean Gabin. Its there but its held back in favor of the more muscular sensitivity inside him. That abstract dance between his softness and power is the heartbeat of the movie and it takes you through financial hardship terrible times and some bloody battles with special grace. CINDERELLA MAN (PG-13 144 minutes) -- Contains boxing violence. Area theaters.

"Cinderella Man inspired schmaltz. Slate Sign In Sign Up Cinderella Man inspired schmaltz. Cinderella Man inspired schmaltz. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 2 2005 530 PM Kid Gloves A boxing movie that goes straight for the heart Cinderella Man. By David Edelstein High-grade schmaltz One of the dangers of being a movie critic is losing touch with the part of you that is not too jaded to cry buckets at a tear-jerker--i.e. your inner sap. Or maybe thats one of the benefits--it depends. In any event my inner sap was rising as I watched Cinderella Man (Universal). Its schmaltzy--but its schmaltz veined with foie gras. Its directed by Ron Howard produced by Brian Grazer and co-written by Akiva Goldsman (with Cliff Hollingsworth) the team that brought you A Beautiful Mind. In that blockbuster Oscar-grabber Howard and Goldsman shamelessly distorted the facts of their subjects life and charted a schizophrenia that exists only in movies with tidy borders between fantasy and reality and a recurring cast of Imaginary Friends. But the film was structured so ingeniously and Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly were so vivid that it would have taken a stronger man than me to keep the sap down. My disgust was retroactive. Incredibly Cinderella Man is even more manipulative. Its a three-hankie weeper You need two for your eyes and one to stanch your sympathetic nosebleed. Its the story of James J. Braddock the lovable hangdog heavyweight boxer and his mousy but rock-hard-when-it-matters wife Mae. As in life his family goes from comfort in the 20s when Braddock is winning to near-bottom at the peak of the Depression. Braddock is washed up as a fighter he cant get even day-labor jobs his kids are starving and sick and then the electricity gets shut off. Down down down Its laid on so thick it should be laughed off the screen. Advertisement But as in A Beautiful Mind there is Russell Crowe and what a mesmerizing dude he has become. In every performance his physique posture and rhythms change. His Braddock is tender with a lopsided grin appraising eyes and a head with a slight bobble--from dodging punches maybe but also suggestive of a Haymakers Jig. Theres something of the archetypal happy-go-lucky (cinematic) Irishman about him--and thats fine The way he stylizes the performance lightens the bathos. Renee Zellwegers Mae is less inventive. She has a twittery-trembly voice a primly set mouth and eyes so squinched they almost vanish into her dumpling cheeks. But if shes not a knockout she wins on points. Her sincerity shines through. As Braddocks manager Joe Gould Paul Giamatti is a knockout with a wonderful jabbering attack that lets him weave in and out of Crowes more delicate cadences. Its a great matchup and both actors triumph. This Depression-era fable has the plush design that only an A-list cast and director can justify but once you get past the lack of grit in Howards technique the zillion-dollar antique cars and the shadowy deep-toned palette of cinematographer Salvatore Totino the scariness of life in 30s America does take hold. You watch the day laborers begging for work and feel their constant nagging fear--not of what FDR called ""fear itself"" but of the literal shortage of milk for kids. After his miracle comeback--and by the way ""Cinderella Man"" was a moniker actually bestowed on him by Damon Runyon--Braddock tells reporters ""Im fighting for milk."" Thats a man acting on an instinct more primal than the one that impels him to fight. And those fights? Stunning. No theyre not Expressionist ballets as in Raging Bull. You see them largely from Braddocks point of view (and Goulds and Maes--even though shes never there) with white flashes of pain (sometimes intercut with fast images of his kids) and cunning shifts in speed. Every blow makes you cringe Crowes Braddock seems so breakable that when he comes up with the quick combinations that lay his opponents flat youre amazed even if you know the story going in. Cinderella Man builds to Braddocks title bout with blowhard champ Max Baer (Craig Bierko) who had already beaten two boxers to death. According to Jeremy Schaaps biography Baer--while clownish in the ring--was conflicted about fighting and feared killing more men. In the film hes a pretty conventional (if entertaining) windup preen-and-sneer machine who delivers low blows and even purrs to Mae that if Braddock dies she can always visit him. And theres an eerier antagonist boxing kingpin Jimmy Johnston (Bruce McGill) a chill immaculately tailored capitalist pig who casts Braddock out of boxing and only lets him back in when Gould convinces him its good for the bottom line. Does McGill play more loathsome parts than any man alive? Id love to see him in a few more sympathetic roles like the one he played in The Legend of Bagger Vance. Advertisement If the movie has no use for fat cats it also comes with a weird anti-welfare tinge. The real Braddock was ashamed of accepting charity and Howard and Goldsman seem to endorse his view. Or perhaps theyre too opportunistic to let another chance to humiliate their protagonist pass. Desperate to reclaim his kids from better-off relatives (he promised his son that he wouldnt send the kid away) Braddock gets in line for government relief and the woman at the window says sickened ""I never thought Id see you here Jim."" Who the hell is she? And why does she express contempt for the people she gives aid to--in the middle of the Great Depression? A Communist-organizer friend (Paddy Considine) meanwhile is an angry doomed figure--in contrast to Braddock who regards attempts to change the system as like ""punching stuff you cant see."" What saves Braddock is his preference for actual fisticuffs--along with ironically his hard labor in docks and freight yards which helped him build up his weaker left hand. For all I know Ron Howard is a nasty S.O.B. but its doubtful. In public hes still Opie and his films are conservative in ways that would gladden Sheriff Andys heart. (Too bad theres no Barney Fife to undercut the sanctimony.) Howard manipulates audiences without guile jerking tears piling on catastrophes smoothing out dissonances making bad characters badder and good ones gooder--and clearly believing that this is wholesome or movies like Cocoon A Beautiful Mind and Cinderella Man wouldnt work. At what he does hes peerless. I wish I had more respect for what he does--and for myself the next morning for surrendering. Update Im indebted to Alan Yudman for suggesting an alternate reading of the woman-in-the-window line that for her seeing Braddock on the dole was the ultimate proof of the tragedy of the Depression. Maybe hes right--it makes more sense than my interpretation. But because of Braddocks own self-disgust at having to ask for help from the government I heard the line as a rebuke--as I think Braddock does. The larger point is that in Cinderella Man no one has any expectations of a safety net--not even as the Roosevelt administration is crafting the New Deal to protect the have-nots from the ultimate degradation of poverty and starvation. The Commie who wants to change society in more fundamental ways is ineffectual. Its the apolitical Braddock and his improbable second chance at fame and fortune the movie says that is the brightest beacon of hope for the downtrodden. Go celebrity I submit that the New Deal had more than Braddock to do with lifting the nations spirit. Braddock might have decided to pay back the government (and make a public show of it) but his shame was misplaced. After all Rush Limbaugh lived on welfare too. (Did he pay it back?) Thanks also to those who reminded me of Bruce McGills rousing good-guy turn in The Insider in which he rips some tobacco executives a new one. Hes an extremely compelling actor and it seems that many of us would love to see him in other kinds of roles (and even more often).

In real life the organ in question belonged to New Jersey boxer James J. Braddock an Irish-American comeback kid who triumphed over poverty and an injured right hand to defeat killer heavyweight Max Baer in 15 rounds at Madison Square Garden in 1935 to the unrestrained joy of a New York proletariat reeling from the Depression. According to Cliff Hollingsworth who wrote the script for Cinderella Man with Goldsman Braddock was indeed a standup guy a devoted friend and family man known to his fans as Gentleman Jim who was shamed by having to go on public relief returned the dole money in person when his luck turned and gracefully retired while he was still on top. Even Damon Runyon pronounced Braddocks life a tale worth telling though I suspect he would have winced at the populist pudding Howard has made of it. Howard is known as one of the film industrys genuinely nice people and I suspect he made this great big Opie of a movie more in a spirit of sincerity than of patronage toward his subject or his audience. But there is no underestimating the remote-control condescension Hollywood high-ups are capable of when it comes to picturing the lives of ordinary folk. Nothing daunted by charges that they cleaned up schizophrenic mathematician John Nashs character in A Beautiful Mind for purposes of inspirational uplift Howard and Goldsman have folded this boxers colorful life into an instance of that hoary old canard about the meek inheriting the Earth. Braddock may well have been a hell of a fellow but it strains belief that a born fighter with sufficient guts and stamina to prevail in a business not known for its moral purity would also possess the simple-minded saintliness ascribed to him in Cinderella Man. The movie is calamitously miscast beginning with Russell Crowe who for all his pumped-up pectorals gives a stupefyingly docile performance as the boxer mumbling and shuffling and ducking his head even when off duty and deploying an unflaggingly high mind in the face of adversity. No opportunity for sentimental editorializing goes unseized. When chronic unemployment reduces Braddock and his family to penury we see him surrounded by raggedy extras who look like refugees from a stage production of Oliver marching his little boy down to the butchers to return a stolen salami then swallowing his working-class pride by accepting public relief and begging at a bar frequented by indifferent sports honchos. When his luck changes and he gets his big chance we are given to understand in flashback cutaways that what spurs him on is never a drive to win but past images of his starving kids. By the grace of God and of Braddocks trainer (Paul Giamatti growling valiantly but clearly at a loss) and of course of the spunky little missus played by Renee Zellweger in a flurry of coy simpers and the usual squeezed-lemons grimace he becomes a star. Cinderella Man isnt much more of a fight movie either. The lead-up to Braddocks big night is interminable and suspense-free and as Crowe slogs through his 15 rounds he is slyly upstaged by Craig Bierko who brings a brutish flash -- a relief after all that rampant sanctity -- to the role of the hard-partying dirty fighter Max Baer. Even when playing noble types Crowe is an actor who thrives on contradiction. He was at his best as the brooding tobacco-industry whistleblower in Michael Manns The Insider an uptight functionary who couldnt stand seeing the rules bent and became a hero in spite of himself. Stripped of all complexity not to say the naked ambition that drives most sporting idols his Jim Braddock is little more than a well-mannered ever-so-umble model. As it happens there is a plausible hero tucked away in the background. Braddocks friend Mike Wilson (Paddy Considine) is a hotheaded activist who far from being cowed by the Depression is enraged by the big-business greed that brought it on and tries to organize the demoralized masses. Mike unlike Braddock is the sort of man who would know that not everyone can be a star and that in times like these government assistance so far from being a source of shame is a workers right. Which may be why this smugly individualistic movie casts him as a bit of a pinko know what I mean and a drunk to boot.

"Cinderella Man | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; cinderella-man ) Cinderella Man (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Consider Cinderella Man to be a Depression era Rocky. While that may at first seem like a glib way to describe Ron Howards rags-to-riches boxing drama a careful examination of the storyline reveals numerous similarities between this drama and Sylvester Stallones Oscar winner. Perhaps thats because the formula associated with boxing movies demands a sameness. Whatever the reason the specter of Rocky hovers over Cinderella Man like a restless thing. During the concluding moments if you close your eyes you can almost hear Apollo Creed gasping ""No rematch"" This is based on a true story although thankfully Howard doesnt come right out and say it. The opening caption references a quote by Damon Runyon but thats as close as the director comes to saying that the movie is a bio-pic. From the accounts of Jim J. Braddocks career I can find Cinderella Man offers a reasonably accurate portrayal of what happened in the ring. I cant speak to how correct the depictions of Braddocks home life are. Although the movie is entertaining and succeeds in its goal as a feel-good experience it does not rank in the top echelon of Howards films. Overlong and unevenly paced Cinderella Man hits stretches (especially between bouts) when it threatens to lose its audience. The movie opens in November 1928. The ""Bulldog of Bergen"" Jim J. Braddock (Russell Crowe) is an up-and-coming light heavyweight fighter who is on his way to becoming a challenger for the championship. After every fight his loving wife Mae (RenA(c)e Zellweger) waits for him at the front door to their house since she cant bear to watch him in the ring. Following this brief introductory section Cinderella Man jumps ahead five years. The country is mired in the Great Depression and Jims fortunes havent been better than those of the country in general. He is a has-been who only gets a few dollars a night for participating in second-rate bouts. When he breaks his hand his career appears to be over and he goes to work as a longshoreman. However with day jobs being unreliable and low-paying he and Mae soon lose the electricity in their apartment a situation that endangers the health of their children. A chance at redemption occurs when his former manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti) offers him 250 to fight on short notice with a heavyweight contender. Jim is expected to lose and lose badly but he confounds the experts and his June victory over Corn Griffith propels him on the fast lane to a shot at the title against a ferocious and heavily-favored opponent Max Baer (who has previously killed two inferior boxers). Borrowing liberally from Martin Scorsese (Raging Bull) Howard creates boxing sequences that are as brutal as they are compelling. When Jim is in the ring Cinderella Man is never boring. Unfortunately the same cannot be said of all the connective material which is intended to form the movies backbone. The scenes that show Jim as a loving husband and father and depict him as a good friend to his equally down-on-his-luck pal Mike (Paddy Considine) are trite. Instead of developing the main character into a fully three-dimensional individual they serve only to drag out the running time. Cinderella Man is a decent 105-minute movie that has been stretched to fill nearly 2 1/2 hours. One non-boxing scene stands out as being worth the celluloid it was printed on. When he reaches rock bottom Jim faces the possibility of having to send his children to stay with relatives. Yet he has promised his oldest son Jay (Connor Price) that he would not do this. So in order to raise the money to re-connect the electricity he goes to a club frequented by his old boxing confederates many of whom are high-rollers. With hat in hand (literally) he asks for donations. Its a moving sequence that brings home some of the hard reality of life in the 1930s. Theres nothing wrong with the acting although most of the participants have done more impressive work in the past. Russell Crowe working with the director for the first time since A Beautiful Mind is effective as Jim both inside and out of the ring. RenA(c)e Zellweger who has already looked ""frumpy"" as Bridget Jones tries on ""mousy"" for this role. A spark of energy comes from Paul Giamatti who has a solid chance of being nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of Joe Gould (if only because the Academy will feel that they owe him for 2004s Sideways snubbing). The period details are impeccable. Howard goes to great pains to convince us that were back in the Depression. From his re-creation of the old Madison Square Garden to the infamous ""Hooverville"" this feels like the 1930s. Unfortunately the by-the-numbers script which hits every boxing clichA(c) with far less effectiveness than other contenders (such as the aforementioned Rocky) doesnt do the other aspects of the production justice. True story or not Cinderella Man seems like the uncomplicated fairy tale its title hints at. This is 2005s Seabiscuit an inspirational ""adult"" drama thrown into theaters in the midst of the summers blockbusters. As counter-programming it may be successful but as entertainment its on the bubble. To use a boxing metaphor it lands a few solid punches but never achieves anything close to a knock-out.

An exquisite ode to a working-class hero ""Cinderella Man"" takes the almost impossibly perfect elements of the saga of underdog boxer James J. Braddock and fills it with emotional gravitas wrenching danger and a panoramic sense of American life during the Great Depression. Oscar winner ""A Beautiful Mind"" seems a warmup to this main event in which helmer Ron Howard grasps the full measure of artistry hes often reached for and gifted thesp Russell Crowe limns a role he seems born to play. Universals summer release strategy seems riskier than Braddocks final bout but solid sustained B.O. boosted by glowing critical response -- with a late-round re-release during awards season -- could deliver winning results. Its unavoidable to compare Braddocks arc of triumph -- from contender to washed-up club fighter to heavyweight championship challenger -- with the story of Seabiscuit. But ""Cinderella Man"" far outpaces that pic thanks to an exceptionally developed story a roster of career-worthy performances and a hero who can speak. Despite its seemingly simplistic outline of a can-do spirit triumphing during the Depression the film plumbs the angry depths Howard sounded in his tough underappreciated Western ""The Missing"" and only hinted at before that. Howard with screenwriters Cliff Hollingsworth and Akiva Goldsman exhibits a loving understanding of Warners raw 1930s films of desperate working-class lives and hard-scrabble heroes and of the boxing genre from ""Champion"" to ""Raging Bull."" Crowes Braddock is a good family man of stalwart but never self-destructive pride who explains his reason for boxing is to put milk on his kids table. Making the connection between Braddocks career trajectory and the nations fortunes the film somewhat excessively superimposes dates and locations to briefly chronicle his ring successes of the 20s and his losses just as the Depression hit. By 1932 Braddock was broke. Pic is divided between Braddocks struggles at home and his unprecedented comeback. Both aspects are brilliantly supported -- the first by Renee Zellweger as Braddocks plucky wife Mae the second by Paul Giamatti as his trusty trainer/manager Joe Gould. A gentle pan shot shifts from the Braddocks comfy home during the good times to a bleak one-room cold-water flat four years later in New Jersey where Braddock Mae and kids Jay Rosemarie and Howard scrape by. When Jay (Connor Price) is caught stealing a sausage from a meat store Braddock treats him with understanding and assures the boy he wont be sent to live with richer relatives. Things get worse. Braddock is so inept in a 1933 bout that his boxing license is revoked. He winds up looking for work on the Hoboken loading docks (the location of ""On the Waterfront""). He finds an ally in co-worker Mike Wilson (Paddy Considine) a former Wall Street broker-turned-radical and the films most significant fictional creation. A measure of the scripts craft is how well Mike is integrated with the reality-based characters serving as a way for the pic to comment on the politics of the times. Braddock reaches bottom in a sequence that a more insistent director might have pushed over the top when Mae sends the kidsoff to relatives while Braddock is away at work. Pale and drawn Crowe looks like the life is being sucked out of him as he realizes Maes well-intentioned action means his promise to Jay has been broken. Begging for change from his former boxing associates at a Madison Square Garden hangout Braddock is reunited with Joe on the offer of a one-time match. Gradually the workings of the sweet science and the business behind it take the forefront somewhat backgrounding Mae (who makes a point of never attending a bout). Yet Zellwegers side of the story continues to provide surprising moments as when she discovers Joe and wife Lucille (Linda Kash in an aces cameo) are so determined to maintain appearances that they live in their gorgeous apartment sans furniture. Final hour ratchets up the tension as Braddock counters skeptics and wins matches ultimately earning a bout with ferocious heavyweight champ Max Baer (Craig Bierko). Pic shows the magnitude of the mountain Braddock must climb when a promoter shows Braddock film of Baers roundhouse punches killing opponents. If theres any complaint in the finely judged lead-up to the climax its in the easy way the pic paints Baer as the bad guy. Result is a far less dimensional Baer than in Jeremy Schaaps new Braddock biography (also ""Cinderella Man"" both borrowed their titles from colorful scribe Damon Runyon). As the grueling match develops and Baers seeming supremacy is challenged by Braddocks wiliness the champs emerging desperation suddenly makes Bierkos cocky superstar human. Fight scenes are consistently well-drawn and balanced (by editors Mike Hill and Dan Hanley) between close-ups long shots and reaction shots around the ring with a deliberate lack of filmic fanciness. The structural mastery of the Baer fight results in a marvelously tense movie-within-a-movie that raises the bar for the fight genre. Pre-credit notes about Braddocks and Maes life afterward feel anticlimactic but provide a moment to consider the actual pummeling Crowe and Bierko went through for the cameras. Taking this performance alongside his work on ""Master and Commander"" its reasonable to place Crowe in the company of the leading men who brought great humanity to classical roles from Spencer Tracy to James Stewart. As Braddock Crowes eyes have never seemed so full of unspoken sadness and ferocity with his body language ranging from spent hopelessness to a single coiled muscle preparing to strike. Interplay with Zellweger is electric with both matched step for step by Giamatti in a performance that many will far prefer to his turn in ""Sideways."" Indeed Giamatti is the films onscreen audience showing his pain at Braddocks flubs and amazement by his turnaround. Overall casting by Howard Jane Jenkins and Janet Hirshenson is inspired. Lenser Salvatore Totino who did excellent work in ""The Missing"" has a more ambitious range of images and moods here and creates a virtual gallery of Depression life from the most intimate to the most cosmopolitan. Wynn Thomas sensitive production design is remarkably human-scale for this kind of pic.Thomas Newmans score blessedly short on Irish motifs is the only element a bit too in love with its own sense of grandness.
