Throwing out a net to everyone from back-row teenage saliva-swappers to seasoned seniors the film feels like it has been coldly calculated to hoover up demographics. How? Marshall gives his rom-com the Robert Altman Short Cuts treatment an enormous megawatt ensemble cast appear in a dozen or so interlocking lurve stories that play out on Valentines Day in Los Angeles. Its supremely efficient and utterly ruthless.There are 19 all-star names above the title (in alphabetical order naturally) but the lead belongs to Ashton Kutcher . A nice-guy florist he proposes to his work-addict girlfriend ( Jessica Alba ) but is obviously much better suited to his teacher best friend ( Jennifer Garner ). Jessica Biel (is it me or are the Jessicas interchangeable?) plays a neurotically single sports publicist. Anne Hathaway  an office temp who moonlights as a phone sex operator (little nod to Short Cuts there) hasnt told her new boyfriend about the sideline. Shirley MacLaine  happily married for 50 years is keeping an old secret from her husband. In what reeks of final-draft add-on country star Taylor Swift and Taylor Lautner from The Twilight Saga pair up as school sweethearts no actual storyline here but they tick the pre-teen box big time.These are sassily-scripted but glossy vacuous fantasies - with the exception of Julia Roberts s army captain whos on short leave from Iraq and meets a guy ( Bradley Cooper ) on a plane after some sparky but non-committal flight banter they go their separate ways and both their tales resolve with unexpectedly lovely flourishes. Their stories make the rest of the film look like its got a cold shiny cash register right where its heart should be.

So much love so little cinematic sense Add to ... Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Feb. 12 2010 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 313PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Valentines Day Directed by Garry Marshall Written by Katherine Fugate Starring most everybody except Hugh Grant and Jennifer Aniston Classification PG In your typical subpar Hollywood romcom theres only one tedious love story to put up with. Well Valentines Day (such a clever title) does a whole lot better than that It offers 10 tedious love stories to put up with. Now dont hold me to that exact head count. Never much on estimating crowd sizes I could be off by an amorous couple or three. Which reminds me. Since 10 yarns necessitates 20 performers pretty much every romantic lead in the biz appears in this flick. So for purposes of identification it might be easier simply to mention who isnt in it. Far as I can tell Hugh Grant isnt. Neither I think is Jennifer Aniston. The crowd gathers in Los Angeles on a single Feb. 14 and the daisy-chain plot unfolds from sunup to sundown. First then the couples awaken in their various beds. When they do Ashton Kutcher slips an engagement ring around the finger of Jessica Alba but she doesnt seemed too thrilled about it so that aint going anywhere. Meanwhile Patrick Dempsey hides his wedding ring from Jennifer Garner which says it all about the lying two-timer. Then Anne Hathaway bolts out of the sack and leaves Topher Grace in a state less than graceful. Forgive her haste though cause shes in the communication industry and has work to do ""Valentines is the busiest day of the year for phone sex."" I didnt know that. How many couples is that? Damn only three. Okay bear with me. Shirley MacLaine and Hector Elizondo are a pair of long-married geezers sitting on an undisclosed secret; Jamie Foxx seems to be cruising in the general direction of Jessica Biel; Julia Roberts is an army captain flying home on a commercial plane and keeping close aeronautic company with Bradley Cooper; Emma Roberts and Carter Jenkins are hormonal high-schoolers keen to lose their virginity but this being a family picture dont bet on it; ditto for Taylor Swift and Taylor Lautner since a movie just cant have too many horny teens (or apparently actors named Taylor). I know I know Im still missing a few couples but higher math was never my strong suit and unaccountably I attended the screening without a slide rule and calculator. So sue me if you must for neglecting my plot-summary duties. I can only plead nolo contendere. Of course the above-mentioned thespians all play characters who as the interminable day wears on interconnect in different and occasionally surprising ways. Kind of like Crash yet without the cars and the pretentious social conscience. Now some might find a little mild amusement in discovering exactly how they connect. But not me. I was too busy feeling sorry for veteran director Garry Marshall saddled with the unenviable task of ensuring that every crowd member gets his or her face time onscreen. His solution is forthright enough The film may be set in L.A. but no scene lasts longer than a New York minute. From airplane to high school to bedroom and back again Marshall is always cutting away from somebody or something. But its what he often cuts to that initially had me baffled. Why is his camera so fond of soliciting reaction shots from dogs - big dogs small dogs yappy ones mute ones? Hmm. Anyway by the end we do learn a thing or two about the holy subject of amour. MacLaine tells us ""When you love someone you love all of them"" but you know that could just be Shirley talking that reincarnation jive again. Then another wise voice asserts ""You dont step into love you fall."" Thats when it hit me my epiphany. You dont fall for a movie like Valentines Day but its just the sort of squishy thing you might accidentally step into. So hey maybe that explains all those damn dogs. Just a guess.

Or do you think ""What is this crap? It tastes like cardboard and the idiot spelled yours truley wrong on the card. Im outta here"" If youre with the first group youre in luck Valentines Day assembles a bouquet of blooming celebrity movie stars including Julia Roberts Ashton Kutcher Jessica Alba Taylor Swift Taylor Lautner and Jamie Foxx shuffles them in skits about love gone right and wrong and hopes you wont notice that every skit is lame every line of dialogue is stale every joke falls flat and every performance has been phoned in between text messages to agents blinking ""SOS"" Durable shlockmaster director Garry Marshall (Pretty Woman Runaway Bride) and the industrial team that welded the interlocking story pieces into a screenplay that could be translated into NaVi without losing nuance have done the impossible Theyve made attractive stars boring and reduced love relationships to the weight of a box of Altoids. (Word is there are already studio plans to make a variation of this big-screen entertainment product on a theme of New Years Eve. Think of the calendar possibilities.) If youre with the second group those of us who like romance in our romance movies then follow me while we search for the emergency exits together. Theres a point in the movie where Anne Hathaway as an otherwise adorable personable eager office temp tries to hide her student loan-paying job as a phone sex worker from her corn-(and corny) fed Midwestern beau (Topher Grace) but is caught talking naughty to a client in a funny accent.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post In ""Valentines Day"" Reed Bennett tracks down best friend Julia at the airport to warn her about a romantic blunder. On the florists busiest day he learns something about Julias new beau (played by Patrick Dempsey). And after no small amount of struggle he decides to be a good friend and tell her. Reed (Ashton Kutcher) only wishes someone had done him such a favor. Charmingly cast and phenomenally so-so ""Valentines Day"" begins with Reed proposing to girlfriend Morley. ""She said yes? "" his friends reply when he tells his news. Not a good sign. But then ""Valentines Day"" is about the good bad and sad of romantic expectations. Or so it pretends. In a movie rife with emotional shorthand Kutcher seems to be working in a better film than this roundelay. In the airport scene hes sincerity itself. In fact most of the performers bring at least their B-plus game as Los Angelenos trying to dodge or embrace Valentines Day. The movie is like a box of chocolates. Dont care for the confection with caramel? How about this one with nuts? As in Anne Hathaway who plays Liz a freelancing phone- sex worker. Jennifer Garner portrays Julia. Julia Roberts does quiet duty as Army Capt. Kate Hazeltine headed home from an overseas tour for a rendezvous. Jessica Biel is a publicist who throws an annual party to prove just how much she detests the day. Jessica Albas character loves her BlackBerry most. There are a lot of pretty women in this Garry Marshall-directed comedy written by Katherine Fugate (creator of Lifetimes hit series ""Army Wives""). The guys arent half bad either. Sitting next to soldier Kate on the 14-hour flight is Holden a businessman played by Bradley Cooper. Eric Dane portrays NFL quarterback Sean Jackson whos considering retirement and hankering for a fuller life. Jamie Foxx is Kelvin another V-Day hater and a TV sportscaster assigned man-on-thestreet duty by his producer (Kathy Bates). Its a worn device -- characters improbably overlapping -- that we love when it works. Heartsick kid Edison is going through the throes of first love. Babysitter Grace and her fella are going through with preparations for their ""first time."" Taylor Swift makes a credible bubble-gum debut as Felicia Graces best friend and the girlfriend to another Taylor -- Lautner of ""Twilight"" fame. Edison used to make hand- crafted Valentines with his mom on the big day but now hes watched over by his grandparents played by Shirley MacLaine and Marshall go- to guy Hector Elizondo (""Pretty Woman""). Sounds crammed? It is. Its the type of all-star cast reminiscent of  70s disaster flicks. And with too much duddy dialog ""Valentines Day"" teeters on the minor disaster. The ensemble setup and greeting-card-holiday timing evoke last years ""Hes Just Not That Into You."" Writers for that sleeper Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein helped develop this story. ""Valentines Day"" belittles the forced sentiment of the holiday then reinforces it. It wants to trample on its heart- shaped cake but eat it too. For a really clever date flick that skewers romantic hokum even as it celebrates it consider renting ""(500) Days of Summer."" But if you cant help yourself stay through the credits of ""Valentines Day."" Amid the outtakes youll find a wonderfully blown kiss to a Garry Marshall classic.

"Movie review Valentines Day with Julia Roberts pretty far-fetched washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On >> This StoryRead +|Watch +| Comments Valentines Day Movie review Valentines Day with Julia Roberts pretty far-fetched Jennifer Garner and Ashton Kutcher in the star-studded ""Valentines Day."" (Ron Batzdorff) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Jen Chaney Washington Post Staff Writer Friday February 12 2010 For almost all of its 124 minutes ""Valentines Day"" delivers exactly what anyone with remedial knowledge of the romantic comedy genre would expect marriage proposals and mad dashes through airports; climactic kisses and sudden realizations of love; hot inexplicably lonely women who mainline chocolate; and men who callously dismiss all this Cupid business as nothing more than a ""made-up holiday"" until of course they fall for those hot lonely women who mainline chocolate. This StoryValentines Day Nice to look at hard to watchWatch Valentines Day trailerFind showtimes To be fair ""Valentines Day"" does surprise once or twice as it unspools its multiple vaguely connected L.A. lovey-dovey stories. Those unexpected moments just arent enough to compensate for the fact that this feels less like a movie and more like a strategically programmed effort to turn as many demographic groups as possible into mooshy gooshy candy-heart-munching morons. A key part of that strategic effort is the massive ensemble cast which includes two Oscar nominees (Anne Hathaway and Queen Latifah) four Oscar winners (Shirley MacLaine Jamie Foxx Kathy Bates and Julia Roberts) the niece of an Oscar winner (Emma Roberts) two guys from ""That 70s Show"" (Topher Grace and Ashton Kutcher) two former ""Alias"" stars (Jennifer Garner and Bradley Cooper) McSteamy and McDreamy from ""Greys Anatomy"" (Eric Dane and Patrick Dempsey) a pair of tween sensations named Taylor (Lautner and Swift) and a couple of Jessicas (Biel and Alba). Oh and George Lopez. And Hector Elizondo. And in a brief cameo the kitchen sink. Director Garry Marshall throws in so much -- pretty faces plotlines scenes in which Swift makes out with Lautner while one of her songs plays -- that breaking down the whole heart-shaped mess into a succinct plot summary is a bit of a challenge. But heres my best shot. Reed Bennett (Kutcher) is a florist who wakes up bright early and besotted on Valentines Day and proposes to his career-oriented girlfriend (Alba). She says yes but its clear to everyone -- except of course Reed -- that Flower Guy really belongs with Julia (Garner) the dimple-cheeked sweetie-pie teacher with the doctor boyfriend (Dempsey duh) and the pal in the P.R. business (Biel) who throws an annual anti-Valentines Day bash to mourn her manlessness but just might connect with a local sportscaster (Foxx). I could keep going on like this but you get the picture. Plus it would be hard to continue with a straight face after describing Biel as a neurotic chocolate-pounding Bridget Jones type. This chick is honestly bitter on Valentines Day? Please. Cry me a river. ""Valentines Day"" largely relies on stale gender stereotypes and tired comedy routines that dont elicit much laughter. Still a couple of performers manage to achieve moments of genuine humanity amid the scented-candle haze. Emma Roberts handles her role as a teen grappling with her sexuality with mostly convincing understated grace. And her auntie Julia pops off some palpable sparks with Cooper. In fact its their flirtation that proves most interesting here not only because they make such a fine flirty match but because the movie has the guts to take each of their characters in completely unexpected directions. (Hence the surprises I mentioned earlier.) The rest of ""Valentines Day"" however just runs around the same old romantic-comedy bases never daring to truly change the game.  1/2 PG-13. At area theaters. Contains sexual material and brief partial nudity. 124 minutes. >> This StoryRead +|Watch +| Comments (c) 2010 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  Nice to look at hard to watch Find showtimes Watch Valentines Day trailer",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/11/AR2010021101576.html,200,valentine'sday6,valentine'sday,washingtonpost

Sitting through the all-star fiasco ""Valentines Day"" is like consuming a 5-pound box of cheap chocolates at a single sitting. Less funny or romantic than your average colonoscopy this cringe-inducing bore provides dubious employment for four Oscar winners two nominees and a raft of TV performers such as George Lopez all of whom have been seen to far better advantage elsewhere. Directed by Garry Marshall with absolutely none of the expertise he brought to ""Pretty Woman"" (let alone TVs ""Love American Style"") ""Valentines Day"" is basically a cross between ""Crash"" and an infomercial for the Society of American Florists -- a meandering corny rom-com with a series of loosely connected tales of Los Angelenos on the titular holiday. PHOTOS ""VALENTINES DAY"" RED CARPET If this black hole of a movie can be said to have a center its the reliably awful Ashton Kutcher as a florist who proposes to his girlfriend (Jessica Alba) in the morning and is dumped by lunch. He spends the rest of the day trying to save his best friend (Jennifer Garner) from her secretly married doctor boyfriend (Patrick Dempsey). Another running story involves a TV reporter (Jamie Foxx) who is annoyed to be doing a story on the holiday assigned by his boss (Kathy Bates) when hed rather pursue an NFL player (Eric Dane) with a not-so-big secret by way of the players lovelorn press agent (Jessica Biel). Among the others wasting their time are the Pretty Woman herself Julia Roberts as an Army captain traveling from halfway around the world for a brief Valentines Day rendezvous; Bradley Cooper as the wiseguy in the next airplane seat; Roberts niece Emma as a high schooler plotting to lose her virginity on lunch break; and as her classmates in blink-and-youll-miss-em roles Taylor Lautner and singer Taylor Swift. Another Marshall alumna Anne Hathaway squeezes out most of the movies extremely scarce laughs as a phone sex worker. The same cannot be said for Topher Grace as her dull romantic interest or Queen Latifah as her boss. Like last months equally egregious ""When in Rome"" this is a sloppy mess that cant even be bothered to light and photograph its gorgeous cast properly. The felony is compounded in the case of Shirley MacLaine who is forced to stand in front of a clip from ""Hot Spell"" a movie she made more than half a century ago. In a cemetery Warner Bros. has already announced the same team will be making a follow-up called ""New Years Day."" Government intervention may become necessary. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next London couples Happy medium Read Next London couples Happy medium Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 44370 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 27055 College student kills 3 in house party shooting cops 16318 Braves Brian McCann interest may pave way for Gary Sanchez Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Media San Francisco Chronicle Valentines Day Romantic comedy. Starring Jennifer Garner Ashton Kutcher Patrick Dempsey Jessica Biel Taylor Swift and Shirley MacLaine. Directed by Garry Marshall. (PG-13. 125 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Like most Garry Marshall films ""Valentines Day"" is warm and pleasant and full of nice people. Also like a lot of Garry Marshall films this warm pleasantness occasionally feels forced. In Marshalls movies people are nicer than people are in real life - and less complicated and less interesting. Ever so faintly everyone in a Marshall movie whether were talking about ""Beaches"" or ""Pretty Woman"" ""Georgia Rule"" or ""Valentines Day"" acts like a small child. Behind this I suspect is a genuinely benign vision of life one that has its appeal and speaks well of Marshall the man even if it doesnt always do Marshall the artist any favors. To put it simply this is a filmmaker who is always going to present the world as an essentially kind place populated by hapless well-meaning people. And hes going to do that no matter what the subject is short of the Nuremberg trials. So the whole key with Marshall is in finding material suited to this inevitable message. The good news is that with ""Valentines Day"" he finds a pretty good match. Photo Ron Batzdorff Warner Bros.

TAYLOR SWIFT as Felicia in New Line CinemaOs romantic comedy OValentineOs DayO a Warner Bros. Pictures release. Photo Ron Phillips New Line Cinema Review Happy Valentines Day 1 / 5 Back to Gallery At its worst - fortunately the movie is not often at its worst - there are moments of fake sincerity and even flat-out dishonesty Sometimes characters do things they would not do and neglect to say things that they absolutely would say. But these flaws are more than balanced by an appealing atmosphere that pervades the whole movie an almost holiday feeling. The running time is 125 minutes a lot for a romantic comedy but the minutes fly by. The cast includes many famous names and faces so many that if the movie were a drama they would intrude on the films illusion of reality. In a way they intrude on the reality here as well but in a welcome way contributing a sense of something just a bit fantastic an imaginary pageant of life in contemporary Los Angeles. Here youre asked to believe in Julia Roberts as an American soldier and in Ashton Kutcher as a scruffy florist and in Jessica Biel and Jennifer Garner as two women who cant find a decent guy. But youre not really asked to believe it but rather to enjoy the spectacle and accept the ride. At the center of the movie are two relationships neither perfect. As the sun rises on Valentines Day the florist - a young heart-on-his-sleeve kind of fellow - surprises his girlfriend (Jessica Alba) with a wedding ring. The girl says yes. Meanwhile in another part of town Julia (Garner) is waking up with her new boyfriend a surgeon and shes bemoaning that they wont be able to spend the evening together. He has to go to San Francisco to perform an operation ... or so he says. The cardiologist is played by Patrick Dempsey. Would you believe him? All ages are represented. There are a pair of 18-year-old lovers planning to have sex for the first time. (They dont in an example of movie squeamishness not in keeping with the Valentines Day spirit.) And there is a couple in their 70s played by Hector Elizondo and Shirley MacLaine. Apparently MacLaine plays an actress in the movie because at one point theres an outdoor screening of a MacLaine film from the 1950s. In an affecting shot worthy of G.W. Pabst Marshall puts both MacLaines - old and young both enacting a love scene - in the same frame. Just lovely. There are lots of cameos as well too many to count. However it is worth mentioning that singer Taylor Swift shows up in a couple of scenes playing a vapid Valley girl and shes very funny. -- Advisory This film contains sexual situations.

(SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterFri. Feb. 12 2010 (out of 4)Starring Ashton Kutcher Jennifer Garner Patrick Dempsey Julia Roberts and 15 other big stars. Directed by Garry Marshall. 123 minutes. At major theatres. PG Like a tiny car that putters into the centre ring at the circus and starts disgorging clown after clown Valentines Day has crammed 19 stars into one vehicle.The difference? Clowns are entertaining.Article Continued BelowAshton Kutcher stars as Reed Bennett in this tangled mess of interconnecting stories all of which involve his small Los Angeles flower shop in some way.The sheer size of the star power cast - from Oscar winners Kathy Bates Jamie Foxx and Shirley MacLaine to Americas sweetheart Julia Roberts and Greys Anatomy docs McDreamy (Patrick Dempsey) and McSteamy (Eric Dane) and nearly a dozen more - makes you feel like youll never get to the end of this sappily romantic daisy chain that all takes place on one fateful Feb. 14.Reed has proposed to Morley (Jessica Alba). Meanwhile his best pal teacher Julia (Jennifer Garner) has a hunky new man thing (Dempsey) - and hes a doctor TV sports reporter Kelvin (Foxx) hates Valentines Day (""It gives me acid reflux"" he tells his boss Kathy Bates) and resents being sent out to cover what Angelenos are up to as they mark the day. The poor deluded soul thinks he can get a scoop at a press conference with a football star (Dane) and that will save his career. Yeah him and 30 other hacks with a mic.Heres cute-as-a-bugs ear Anne Hathaway. Shes just started dating Topher Grace but she has a secret - shes a phone sex operator. Didnt that career go out with tissue box-sized cellphones?Meanwhile Jessica Biel who despises Valentines Day so much she hosts an annual dinner at a local restaurant with all the other V-Day haters composes herself by gobbling boxes of chocolates. Sure you do Jessica. If only they made clothes smaller than size 0.And Julia Roberts shows her perfect teeth as an American soldier flying home on leave with a solicitous seatmate (Bradley Cooper).Who did we forget? Theres a lovesick kid a pair of horny teens (one of whom is Emma Roberts niece of Julia) Hector Elizondo because they need an old dude a Bollywood dance number Queen Latifah being Queen Latifah and George Lopez dispensing all kinds of Latino advice.Oh yes and songbird Taylor Swift (who repeatedly plays tonsil hockey with her ex Taylor Lautner) proves in her onscreen debut that as an actress shes a pretty good singer Grammy duets with Stevie Nicks aside.The massive cast is a diversionary tactic to draw eyes away from the predictable story which tosses a few surprises our way none of which will actually come as a surprise.Director Garry Marshall (Happy Days) whose last movie was the equally awkward Georgia Rules is saddled with a limp script peppered with horrible dialogue from a trio of writers including the team behind Hes Just Not That Into You.But while Marshall has a proven track record as a rom-com director - Julia Robertss 1990 star-maker Pretty Woman was his work - its been a while since hes had a hit. And this doesnt break that streak.Its not that a romantic comedy with a packed cast is doomed to fail out of the gate. Love Actually with eight star couples was a delightful funny flick that had several terrific performances most notably Bill Nighy as aging rocker Billy Mack.Motto of the story dont use stars to stack the deck when the script is built like a house of cards.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Movie Information Valentines DayRatingShowtimes | Official site | TrailerDirector Garry MarshallActors Julia Roberts Bradley Cooper Topher Grace Queen Latifah and Jessica BielRun time 124 minutesMPAA rating PG-13 (sexual material brief partial nudity)Synopsis Julia Roberts and Jamie Foxx are just two of the actors in this star-studded movie about intersecting LA love stories on the titular day.More movies from GuideLive.comThe appeal is obvious for both producers (the actors can be hired on the cheap because theyre only needed for a few days of shooting) and for audiences (if you cant stomach Julia Roberts giant teeth and braying laugh worry not - shell be off the screen in approximately 30 seconds).High art? Maybe not. But Valentines Day certainly goes down easy - provided youre willing to accept that someone who looks like Anne Hathaway would be employed as an overbooked phone sex operator who conducts her business on a cellphone in public.Hathaway is the struggling actress who on the morning of Valentines Day falls out of the bed of a talent agency assistant (Topher Grace) a conventional guy yearning to settle down. Meanwhile at his workplace one of the agents (Queen Latifah) is dealing with an important client (Eric Dane) an athlete whos just been cut from his team.The athletes publicist (Jessica Biel) is a neurotic mess who holds an annual Valentines Day party for bitter singles including her schoolteacher friend (Jennifer Garner) who wont be able to attend this year. She happens to be dating a doctor (Patrick Dempsey) whos so perfect and charming that her best friend (Ashton Kutcher) wonders if hes too good to be true.Round and round it goes with new characters popping up every few minutes. Blink and youll miss Jamie Foxx as an ambitious sportscaster Kathy Bates as his hard-nosed producer and George Lopez as Kutchers co-worker. Some of the romantic stories are barely stories at all just excuses to reach another demographic. (Anyone hoping to discover a pair of brave and original new acting talents in Taylor Swift and Taylor Lautner playing dopey teens head over heels will probably be disappointed.)Other plotlines seem intended to place cute young actors in various states of PG-13 rated undress. Witness Carter Jenkins and Emma Roberts as high school seniors deciding whether to have sex for the first time.But there are also moments of surprising warmth courtesy of actors lending the screenplay by Katherine Fugate far more credibility than it deserves. Shirley MacLaine and Hector Elizondo play a long-married couple with a secret that threatens to drive them apart. Kutcher is surprisingly palatable as a guy who pops the question to his girlfriend (Jessica Alba) only to have his heart broken.The storyline that looks like its going to be the most annoying - Julia Roberts as an army captain who meets a handsome lonely guy played by Bradley Cooper on an airplane - takes a pleasingly mysterious turn.Valentines Day is directed by Garry Marshall (Pretty Woman) a Hollywood pro whose idea of knee-slapping hilarity tends to be having secondary Hispanic and Indian players do quirky things.The plot generally restricts itself to the notion of love as its experienced by well-educated mostly white mostly heterosexual people an awfully narrow sample set. For all the talk of sex and hooking up no one gets much play in this movie. As in most of Marshalls pictures (even the Samp;M comedy Exit to Eden) this is finally a deeply conservative vision that stresses the importance of monogamy and the sanctity of marriage.Then again if its radical filmmaking youre after youre probably not going to see a movie that periodically resorts to shots of 3-year-olds kissing to make the audience sigh with happiness. And credit where credit is due in the handling of the films two gay characters Marshall and Fugate prove exceedingly sly.They at once exploit the ""is-he-or-isnt-he-gay?"" speculation that fuels so much of our collective conversation - and then turn around and say ""Who really cares?"" In Valentines Day being gay doesnt make you different at all. It merely earns you an invitation to participate in an overpopulated Hollywood rom-com. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

(Ron Batzdorff) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday February 11 2010 417 PM Title Valentines Day The cinematic equivalent of a box of chocolates and a Hallmark card Garry Marshalls ""Valentines Day"" is sugary sappy and totally predictable. Its also what a whole lot of women are likely to want.As the success of ""Dear John"" proves a date movie doesnt have to be great. It just has to be familiar and reliable. Which is why Marshall also comes armed with a truckload of red roses.In fact his hero is a busy florist named Reed (Ashton Kutcher). Since the movie takes place on Feb. 14 the ultra-romantic Reed gets to interact with almost everyone in his L.A. neighborhood. Before making his first delivery he proposes to Morley (Jessica Alba) then shares the news with his best friend Julia (Jennifer Garner). Julia is dating Harrison (Patrick Dempsey) much to the resentment of bitterly single Kara (Jessica Biel) publicist for football star Sean (Eric Dane). Queen Latifah plays Seans agent whose secretary (Anne Hathaway) is hiding a secret from her new boyfriend (Topher Grace). Yes thats a lot of bold-faced names. But were only halfway through this celestial cast. One minute its ""How cute Taylor Lautner and Taylor Swift play high school sweethearts"" Then its ""Who knew Bradley Cooper and Julia Roberts had such good chemistry?"" Jamie Foxx is the rising sportscaster; Emma Roberts a baby-sitter working for grandparents Hector Elizondo and Shirley MacLaine. And dont blink or you might miss Kathy Bates and George Lopez.Talk about a sweet gig Most of these folks must have pocketed a pretty decent paycheck for what appears to be a few days work each. (Though Swift making a painfully clunky film debut may have ended her big-screen career right here.)Marshall is as savvy as he is unsubtle; he knows that a few laughs some sentimental romance and a zillion celebrities are a nearly surefire recipe for success. So its no surprise hes already planning a sequel called ""New Years Eve."" After all if youre looking for people to spend a holiday with you could do worse than this crowd.

"Valentines Day | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; valentine-s-day ) Valentines Day (United States 2010) February 12 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli It is possible to gather a star-studded ensemble cast and make a frothy delightful movie about love in its many guises. Richard Curtis did it with Love Actually and a parcel of international directors accomplished something similar with the duet of Paris Je taime and New York I Love You. The strengths of those films however - the ability to tell interesting stories and generate substantive characters despite limited screen time - are absent here. Valentines Days greatest strength - its cast - becomes its most obvious weakness. With so many actors fighting for a few extra minutes in front of the camera this feels like a parade of famous faces not a motion picture. And while a few of the skits show glimmers of promise many are time wasters. Valentines Day is essentially a collection of vignettes connected by a common place (Los Angeles) and day (February 14). Some of the characters know each other or are connected in one way or another. Paths occasionally intersect and stories sometimes cross but no one will mistake this for Robert Altman (or for that matter Paul Haggis). The director is Garry Marshall whose sparkling resume is crowned by the chick flick extraordinary Pretty Woman but whose recent output includes Raising Helen and Georgia Rules. Marshall likes romantic fluff which is okay as long as theres an emotional component. In this case too many characters result in a complete inability to relate to anyone on screen. This in turn leads to a creeping sense of boredom. Valentines Days ""through story"" (the one that gets the most time and which is visited the most frequently) stars Ashton Kutcher as Reed Bennett a pink-garbed florist. Reed is caught between two women his commitment-phobic girlfriend Morley (Jessica Alba) and his best buddy Julia (Jennifer Garner). Julia has buried her romantic feelings for Reed and is pursuing a relationship with a philandering doctor Harrison Copeland (Patrick Dempsey). Meanwhile TV sports reporter Kelvin Moore (Jamie Foxx) has been sent out to do a piece about modern love. He surprises himself by finding romance with Kara Monahan (Jessica Biel) the agent for a popular free agent quarterback (Eric Dane). There are other stories too a phone sex worker (Anne Hathaway) who finds her ""night job"" interfering with her less salacious career and her budding relationship with a boyfriend (Topher Grace); two strangers (Bradley Cooper and Julia Roberts) who connect on a 14-hour flight; an old couple (Shirley MacLaine Hector Elizondo) who discover their fifty-plus year marriage wasnt as perfect as one of them thought; two teen couples (Taylor Lautner amp; Taylor Swift; Carter Jenkins amp; Emma Roberts) who contemplate the benefits and pitfalls of sex before high school graduation; and a kid (Bryce Robinson) coping with his first crush. The films main problems are script-related. Most of the stories arent merely perfunctory; theyre superficial. There are a few exceptions. The strangers-on-a-plane idea has promise as does the relationship between the nice guy and the phone sex woman although the latter is more formulaic than the former. As presented here however these are skeletons of the movies they might have developed into. We see a few key scenes a Cliffs Notes version of stories with the potential to be more than what they are allowed to be. Valentines Days central romance - the quadrangle with Reed Morley Julia and Harrison - is so uninspired that the movie falls into a black hole every time Marshall returns to these characters which is too often. Its tough to complain overmuch about acting since no one has enough screen time to leave an impression positive or negative. The possible exception is Ashton Kutcher who rarely ceases smirking and fails to generate a credible character. His scenes with Jennifer Garner hold together with more stability than those he shares with Jessica Alba probably because Garner is a better actor than Alba whose chief asset has always been her looks. Jamie Foxx Jessica Biel Anne Hathaway and Topher Grace show flashes. On the other hand the two Taylors (Swift and Lautner) are unbelievably bad. Even playing an airheaded blonde bimbo Swift is laughable. Lautner at least shows hes a good sport by poking fun at his image. (He has the following line ""I dont feel comfortable about taking off my shirt in public."") Notable actors George Lopez Queen Latifa and Kathy Bates make appearances but they have almost nothing to do and its easy to forget their participation. Joe Mantegna in a cameo makes a bigger impression. Valentines Day will undoubtedly draw a large crowd. Its the only romantic comedy opening over the long Valentines Day weekend the PG-13 rating makes it teen-friendly and the vast sea of familiar names in the cast guarantees a favorite face or two for most movie-goers. The film is keenly aware of these things and feels more like a slickly packaged product than a fully realized motion picture. This is last years offering Hes Just Not that into You with the problems amplified and the positive qualities diminished. If you want to see a bunch of famous people falling in love rent Love Actually instead. Unlike Valentines Day that movie doesnt just talk about hearts; it has one.

Pictures Will romance blossom between best buds Jennifer Garner and Ashton Kutcher? Valentines Day 1/2 (out of four)Stars Julia Roberts Ashton Kutcher Jennifer Garner Shirley MacLaine George Lopez Jessica Biel Jamie FoxxDirector Garry MarshallDistributorWarner Bros. PicturesRating PG-13 for some sexual material and brief partial nudityRunning time 2 hours 5 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Valentines Day has all the awkward tedium of a bad first date without the promise or excitement of a good one. LOVE LESSONS Valentines Day stars share what theyve learned As is often the case with an ensemble romantic comedy centered on a theme some story lines have more oomph than others. But the interconnected tales are overwhelmingly predictable. The overall effect is like a glossy box of candy filled with overly sweet and insipid confections. Like Love Actually its all about relationships -- good ones new ones flagging ones and would-be ones. But unlike Love Actually it doesnt even attempt to present any truths or substantive observations about romance. Where Love Actually was charming and touching Valentines Day is forced and formulaic. Garry Marshall director of Pretty Woman and The Runaway Bride oversees the affections of 21 people on Valentines Day creating a web of subplots that overlap in contrived and superficial ways. Perhaps if hed divided the number of cast members by three it might have been easier to care about the characters. Its an odd movie when Ashton Kutcher is the most dimensional and convincing of a diverse cast that includes four Oscar winners (Kathy Bates Jamie Foxx Shirley MacLaine and Julia Roberts) two Oscar nominees (Queen Latifah Anne Hathaway) an Emmy winner (Hector Elizondo) two Emmy nominees (Patrick Dempsey and Jennifer Garner) and a Grammy-winning pop star (Taylor Swift). Kutcher runs a flower store the hub around which the stories revolve. Its Los Angeles and apparently the citys entire population shops at one florist. At best this little shop of florals is a blandly unoriginal conceit by screenwriter Katherine Fugate (The Prince and Me). Kutcher plays the affable Reed who just popped the question to his cipher of a girlfriend Morley (Jessica Alba). His best friend Julia (Garner) is besotted with her cipher of a boyfriend Harrison (Dempsey in a variation on his McDreamy Greys Anatomy role). Within minutes we know who really should be with whom. Reeds colleague is Alphonso (George Lopez) seemingly on hand to dispense hackneyed advice. He also appears to be the only one with a thriving relationship. Bradley Cooper plays a paper-thin character even in a movie that is essentially a string of cameos. Hes a passenger on a plane next to Roberts an Army officer on leave. Both are friendly but mysterious. The big reveal comes at the end taking shape as another ho-hum contrivance. Roberts has teamed with Marshall before and breaking character slightly she alludes to her Pretty Woman role. But New Moons werewolf hottie Taylor Lautner playing the vapid athlete beau of a ditzy cheerleader played by Swift unintentionally spoofs himself when he insists hes uncomfortable taking off his shirt in public. Roberts niece Emma plays a high school senior assiduously plotting to lose her virginity. Her plan -- with its advance precision and intricate maneuvers -- has all the romance of a bank heist. The film feels as calculatedly sentimental as one of those bland pink candy hearts. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Standards Editor Brent Jones.

He takes a deep breath. It turns out to be his last. Yes that furry face seen in an almost subliminal flash was the feral beast lurking within ""The Wolfman"" a film that begins in an eerie gothic mist of suggestion--and turns into a toothless exercise in the obvious. Watch a clip from ""The Wolfman"" about a man who is cursed starring Benicio Del Toro Emily Blunt and Anthony Hopkins. Video courtesy of Universal Pictures. This updating of the old Universal horror franchise is among the more visually beautiful fright films ever photographed and all the more disappointing for it. Directed by Joe Johnston (""Hidalgo"" ""October Sky"" ""The Rocketeer"") the movie is scary only as regards all its wasted potential--the color-drained unnerving look; the inky black accents; the deliberate pacing; the occasional hint that the director understands the potency of implication. Its all here in grains and drams. So is an accelerating sense of inanity as all the movies elements are reduced to a gruesome fondue accessorized by actorly ham and studio cheese. It may be that this ""Wolfman""--which revives a storyline based more on Hollywood mythology than any particular ethnic fable--was misshapen from the cradle. The usually admirable Benicio Del Toro portraying Victorian stage actor/lycanthrope-to-be Lawrence Talbot is the worst casting choice in recent memory Too old and plush to play the Byronic hero hes also burdened with a modified Moe Howard haircut and a voice that loses us at ""Hello""--a greeting that Mr. Del Toro delivers with all the authority and resonance of the Kim Jong Il marionette in the South Park teams ""Team America."" (Im sorry; I cant get him out of my mind). Mr. Del Toros Talbot returning to his familys ancestral mansion in 1891 Blackmoor finds that his missing brothers shredded corpse has been discovered in a drainage ditch and that his father (Anthony Hopkins) has apparently been dipping into the laudanum cabinet. As his fellow Blackmoorites fueled by vigilante instincts and invective from the pulpit pursue the ""local lunatic"" Lawrence transitions from hunter to hunted A bite from the marauding creature dooms him to a future as a hairy homicidal maniac one who can remove the limbs heads and even hearts of his pursuers so quickly he can barely be seen. ENLARGE Benicio Del Toro as The Wolfman. Universal Pictures Eventually the Wolfman like his movie slows down--what good is state-of-the-art makeup and effects if no one gets to study them? Unlike the succession of glass plates used in 1941s ""The Wolf Man"" through which we viewed the moon-induced metamorphosis of Lon Chaney Jr. it is computerized orthopaedics that accomplish Lawrences transition from man to wolf His limbs contort his face is twisted into a befanged grimace his fingers sprout claws the size of fish knives. In keeping with wolfish tradition its an agonizing process which may account for the creatures ill temper upon becoming fully lupine He doesnt kill to feed any need besides bloodlust and his eviscerations are graphic grotesque and largely unnecessary--although when Mr. Del Toro is seen chowing down on some villagers liver it may be intended as an homage to his somnambulistic co-star Mr. Hopkins (hold the fava beans). There are other allusions--to waterboarding during a scene in which Lawrence is subjected to the primitive therapies of an asylum quack; to religious extremism when the local preacher ascribes the crimes of the Wolfman to divine retribution for unspecified sins. Emily Blunt who ought to be perplexed finding herself in a movie so unhinged is the only human element here thats remotely convincing plausible or attractive; shes sexier than ever as the dead brothers fiancee and gives a subtle performance amid a din of dramatic braying. Ultimately though ""The Wolfman"" is a horror thriller that couldnt have been made any worse by the addition of Abbott amp; Costello. ""Sometimes the way of fate is a cruel one"" mutters ""The Wolfmans"" standard-issue Maria Ouspenskaya-inspired creepy gypsy woman (a befossiled Geraldine Chaplin). No kidding lady. Despite a solid conceit a rather Bronte-esque Ms. Blunt and sufficient computer effects to amuse James Cameron this ""Wolfman"" is enough to make your hair fall out. Valentines Day Speaking of horror director Garry Marshalls latest atrocity ""Valentines Day"" might be described as a Repression-Era Special--an econo-pak of Hollywood second- and third-stringers a couple of genuine stars (Anne Hathaway Julia Roberts) and a couple of annoying movie kids brought together by a poverty of ideas and a director whose only apparent instruction to his cast was ""Act like the people in TV commercials."" With enough sticky sweetness to make your teeth ache ""Valentines Day"" deploys every rom-com cliche minus the com--theres isnt a laugh in the movie unless you count a fleeting sequence featuring comedian Larry Miller whos also probably the least prominent member of the cast (which includes Bradley Cooper Emma Roberts Jessica Alba Patrick Dempsey Shirley MacLaine Hector Elizondo Queen Latifah and George Lopez). ENLARGE Jennifer Garner plays Julia Fitzpatrick in Valentines Day. Warner Bros. Pictures If that lineup wasnt frightening enough Ashton Kutcher and Jennifer Garner are the ostensible leads she a schoolteacher blissfully unaware that her boyfriend (Mr. Dempsey) is married; he a flower-shop owner who has just proposed bedside to his girlfriend (Ms. Alba) who apparently has someone do her hair while she sleeps. The foreshadowings are like billboards When a movie woman looks thoughtful rather than delirious at the sight of an engagement ring things dont bode well for the match. Neither does an affiancing that arrives so early in the story. As each character negotiates his/her own rocky road to romance each of the interlocking episodes inflicts its own particular kind of pain on the viewer who will wonder how any of this happened. So might the performers who will have a few questions for the gods and their agents Taylor Swift the multiple-Grammy-winning singer is nothing short of mortifying as a ditzy high-school student in love with another Taylor (""Twilights"" Mr. Lautner). Jamie Foxx continues his post-""Ray"" slide into self-parody. Topher Grace makes the world safe for innocuous ingenues. Director Marshall grand poobah of the puerile and pandering creates a shameless movie world for which no actor had to travel too far from home in Beverly Hills/Brentwood no one seemed to have worked more than a day to complete his or her abbreviated role and where Jessica Biel cant get a date. Right. Red the hue that dominates this movies palette is the color associated with both Valentines Day and the devil. And theres something vaguely satanic about ""Valentines Day."" Ajami ENLARGE Fouad Habash as Nasri in Ajami. coming If a movie can ever be perfect it may be so only in its particular moment. This is ""Ajami""s moment. An Oscar nominee for Best Foreign Language Film this Arab-Israeli drama set on the mean streets of Jaffa is an urgent immediate jarring-but-fluid multicharacter portrayal of Arab life in an Israel ghetto (the hood of the title) where a drive-by killing provides the overture to a city-wide opera of revenge death drugs and star-crossed love. The co-directors/co-writers Palestinian Scandar Copti and Israeli Yaron Shani possess a Tarantino-esque blitheness about startling violence and employ a ""Pulp Fiction"" approach to narrative-as-mosaic. But they also advance the technique of fracturing time using the backward glances into their sad sad stories as a way of revealing details that enrich and alter the viewers perspective on whats happening among the movies largely Arabic population. While the disposability of life on screen mirrors the disposability of life on the Ajami streets ones immediate impulse is to describe the film as apolitical Its conflicts after all are largely tribal insular and produced by the Arabs own pressure-cooker mentality. But of course nothing could be more political. Red Riding Trilogy It may lack vampires and blue people but the already much-discussed ""Red Riding Trilogy"" is perhaps the moviegoing event of the year. Adapted by Tony Grisoni from David Peaces four novels based on the 70s-80s Yorkshire Ripper murders its an all-star showcase for contemporary British/Irish acting and the gifts of Julian Jarrold James Marsh and Anand Tucker who directed parts one two and three respectively. Terrific performances are turned in by leads Paddy Considine (part 2) and David Morrissey (part 3) but it is Andrew Garfield--as the young reporter who suspects that the Ripper case is being used as a cover for a child-sex ring involving the entirety of a sordid Yorkshire constabulary--who establishes himself as one of the more gifted young actors around. Reminiscent of the best British TV crime series (""Prime Suspect"" to name one) ""RRT"" delves far deeper into the heart of darkness than its predecessors have ventured or where most contemporary filmmakers dare to go. Produced by and aired last year on the U.K.s Channel Four it is taut disturbing wonderfully awful and at 307 minutes epic. ""Red Riding"" will eventually wend its way back to the small screen but can continue to be seen in the proportions it deserves at the IFC Center in Manhattan or beginning today at the Nuart in West Los Angeles. --John Anderson contributes film criticism and coverage to a variety of publications. Joe Morgenstern is on vacation. DVD Focus ENLARGE The Wolf Man (1941) The first in Lon Chaney Jr.s string of Wolf Man appearances features the formidable cast of Claude Rains Ralph Bellamy Bela Lugosi and of course Maria Ouspenskaya who basically tells Chaneys Larry Talbot that hes doomed. The story is by the German-born Curt Siodmak several of whose novels (""Donovans Brain"" ""The Beast With Five Fingers"") were turned into movies and whose ""Wolf Man"" script extrapolated from a number of legends and employed the famous verse ""Even a man who is pure in heart / And says his prayers by night / May become a Wolf when the Wolfbane blooms / And the Moon is full and bright."" ENLARGE An American Werewolf in London (1981) Among the many werewolf knockoffs (""I Was a Teenage Werewolf"" ""The Werewolf"" ""Werewolf Woman"") is this quasicomic take from John (""Animal House"") Landis in which a backpacking American tourist (David Naughton) is bitten by a creature that none of the locals will admit exists. All the songs titles by the way contain the word ""moon"" (""Bad Moon Rising"" ""Moondance"" ""Blue Moon"" etc). ENLARGE Wolf (1994) Casting Jack Nicholson as a wolfish man doesnt seem much of a stretch but director Mike Nichols working from a script by Jim Harrison and Wesley Strick created an extended metaphor for American business and American manhood by moving the werewolf legend into the publishing world. There traditionalist book publisher Will Randall (Nicholson) is under siege by a ruthless media mogul (Christopher Plummer) and an underhanded rival (James Spader). Under siege that is until a werewolf bite turns Will into a corporate cutthroat sexual beast and type AAA personality. --John Anderson Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Anne Hathaway and Topher Grace in ""Valentines Day."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Valentines Day"" is an ensemble romantic comedy designed along the lines of a pinball machine. The play field includes multiple targets and scoring objectives and the characters are like silver spheres being flipped against one brightly lit obstacle after another. Their narrative arcs collide often and the filmmakers regularly cheat by giving the rig a strong nudge of coincidence. The contraption is designed to be as eye-catching as possible; every available space is filled with pretty people tasteful homes great clothes and glittering jewels. The cast is such a sprawling cross-section of romcom vets (Roberts Hathaway Biel Garner Latifah Alba) that you worry about the ones who arent on board Are Katherine Heigl and Amy Adams sick or something? Most of the connections come through Reed (Ashton Kutcher) a busy romantic florist. He spends the day shuttling across Los Angeles delivering bouquets advice and the occasional bit of bad news. Since the course of true love never runs smoothly there are traffic accidents fumbled deliveries and awkward revelations. In quick-hit vignettes we follow the players through every permutation from preadolescent puppy love to hormonal teen crush to career-girl dejection to heartbreak to makeup sex to geriatric bliss all en route to a dozen Hollywood endings. None of these story threads is especially insightful or deeply rooted in reality but they are categorically cute. Jessica Biel plays a chocoholic PR agent who stays svelte by pounding a treadmill as she gorges on Peppermint Patties. Her key client an NFL star played by Eric Dane is at a career crossroads. His manager Queen Latifah arranges a press conference attended by TV sports reporter Jamie Foxx. Each one of them has ample reason to attend the I Hate Valentines Day party that Biel is organizing for that evening. Her best pal Jennifer Garner is nutty for smugly handsome surgeon Patrick Dempsey who juggles fruit when women make him nervous (he has reason to be nervous). Julia Roberts is an Army captain on a commercial flight to LAX; Bradley Cooper is her agreeable seatmate. The film seems like a package deal arranged by a talent agency that found half its stars were idle for a day or two over a three-week period. The freshest pairing is Taylor Lautner as a shy high school hunk (""Im not comfortable taking my shirt off in public"" protests the ""Twilight"" beefcake) and Taylor Swift as his ditsy horndog girlfriend. The country star who clearly enjoys performing reveals a ticklish gift for screwball comedy. The film hints at public anxiety over the fragility of love and matrimony but comes down strongly for the ideal of love for loves sake. The most interesting twist is its endorsement of a double standard Philandering men richly deserve public exposure and disgrace while straying women need to be loved and cherished despite their transgressions. Presumably director Garry Marshall (""Pretty Woman"") considers this a feminist reversal for the era of John Edwards Mark Sanford and Tiger Woods. VALENTINES DAY  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for some sexual material and brief partial nudity. ""Valentines Day"" has no higher agenda than keeping you in a good mood for two hours and like a skilled pinball designer Marshall assembles his mechanical contrivances to entertaining effect. When its over youre giddy and dazed and amazed at where the time went.

As sweets go its not dense and complex like a truffle rather its light and modest like a chocolate kiss. Its not art; its a pick-me-up.The script from Katherine Fugate sprawls as wide as Greater Los Angeles and goes about as deep as well a Hallmark card.No matter. It is a pleasant undemanding movie that takes place over 18 hours on V-Day and considers Very Attractive People whose romantic destinies converge diverge and cloverleaf like the interstates threading through Californias Southland.They include Jessica Biel Bradley Cooper Patrick Dempsey Hector Elizondo Jamie Foxx Jennifer Garner Topher Grace Anne Hathaway Ashton Kutcher Taylor Lautner George Lopez Queen Latifah Shirley MacLaine Julia Roberts and Taylor Swift as a cross-section of the citys population.Given veteran MacLaine and newbie Swift (Grammy-winning pop powerhouse) the actor demographics make this a movie that appeals equally to grandparents and grandchildren - not to mention the sandwich generation in between.And given its 57 varieties of love - spousal maternal puppy straight gay faithful and adulterous - it appeals to a wide range of romantic proclivities.The films narrative engine is the affable Kutcher as Reed a florist whose shop delivers roses - and not a few thorns - to other characters. A romantic who proposes to his girlfriend (Jessica Alba) on Valentines Day Reed believes love is a truly radical act. This is one of the many homilies purveyed by Fugates script based on a story by Hes Just Not That Into You scribes Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein.With its FTD-arranged flowers and chocolate-box accents this valentine betrays a manufactured rather than handcrafted quality but is redeemed by its actors. Apart from Kutcher Marshall elicits the best performances from Hathaway (his Princess Diaries protegee) as an aspiring actress with a curious sideline and Foxx unusually loose as a television sportscaster assigned a Valentines Day fluff piece. (Note to parents There is a subplot about teenagers planning to relieve themselves of their virginity.)Students of pop culture will appreciate that Lautner who runs through most of New Moon with torso bared makes a joke about not liking to be seen shirtless. And that Roberts who in Marshalls Pretty Woman takes a famous shopping trip down Rodeo Drive makes a joke about Beverly Hills retail during the films credit sequence. Thats not art folks.

"Valentines Day reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Valentines Day reviewed. Valentines Day reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Feb. 11 2010 541 PM Valentines Day Fine mush your boring faces together already. By Dana Stevens After youve seen Valentines Day cuddle up with your beloved and indulge in our Spoiler Special discussion You can also download the program here or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed via iTunes or directly with our RSS feed. Valentines Day The best part of Valentines Day (Warner Bros.) is when Taylor Swift locks Taylor Lautner in her basement in order to fatten him up and feed him to Jessica Biel but then George Lopez breaks in and rescues him and the two of them fall in love. No wait that didnt happen. It must have been the bit when Ashton Kutcher and Jennifer Garner met cute at Home Depot--they were both buying sandpaper but they didnt know what gauge they needed so they tested the grit level by sanding each others forearms raw. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Honestly theres no way a reasonable viewer should be expected to keep straight the plot of a movie with 23 significant characters and (allowing for overlap) somewhere between 10 and a dozen independent storylines. Just know this Over the course of one Valentines Day in Los Angeles--a holiday that in this movies universe holds the sacramental significance of its ancient Roman ancestor Lupercalia--a whole bunch of name-brand movie stars and some other people who closely resemble them cavort make mistakes and eventually fall--or fall back or confirm that they have always been--in love. Advertisement To the extent there is a main story here its probably that of Ashton Kutcher who plays Reed Bennett a florist who as the movie begins proposes to his girlfriend Morley (Jessica Alba). She accepts and Reed begins his busiest day of the year on cloud nine. But as the flower-delivery orders start pouring in problems accrue. Reeds best friend Julia (Jennifer Garner) comes in to sigh over the dreaminess of her new love Harrison (Patrick Dempsey). But Reed knows from a flower order that Harrison has just placed that Julias boyfriend already has a wife and child. Should he tell her the truth and risk ruining her Valentines Day? Then Jessica Alba shows up sans engagement ring and complaining of cold feet. A little boy (Bryce Robinson) rides his bike to the flower shop to order flowers for a mystery woman; that little boys nanny (Emma Roberts) is a high-schooler planning to lose her virginity at lunch hour to her boyfriend (Carter Jenkins) and the boys grandparents (Shirley MacLaine and Hector Elizondo) are a devoted couple about to face a revelation that will test their relationship. A separate set of subplots revolve around a football player (Eric Dane) rumored to be on the verge of retirement. Hes pursued by a local TV sportscaster (Jamie Foxx) gets in a fender-bender with the florists deliveryman (George Lopez) and is hovered over by his breezily self-confident manager (Queen Latifah) and his shrill neurotic publicist (Jessica Biel). In whats probably the movies least awful storyline Anne Hathaway as an aspiring actress who secretly moonlights as a phone-sex operator tentatively plans to celebrate V-Day with her boyfriend of two weeks a straight-laced transplant from Indiana (Topher Grace). Exhausted from trying to follow all that? Cry me a river. Try realizing a half-hour into this 126-minute movie that all those narratives (plus at least three more) have just been set in place and that youre responsible for accompanying and eventually summarizing all 12 story arcs from buildup to crisis to resolution. Its like operating an air-traffic control tower Whoa Shirley MacLaine incoming Landing gear deployed ... take er to the gate boys. George Lopez you keep circling up there while Jessica Alba refuels. Perhaps fittingly there is a literal air-travel theme in Valentines Day with Julia Roberts and Bradley Cooper flirting at 35000 feet and Ashton Kutcher running barefoot through an airport. (What if all of the people who raced through airports on-screen--Kutcher George Clooney in Up in the Air O.J. in that car-rental ad--collided in a giant heap and just lay there cursing and writhing?) Hathaway and Grace do at least have some physical chemistry and her phone-sex scenes are the only hint in this hearts-and-flowers universe that someone somewhere is thinking about getting it on. Contemplating the romantic prospects of Ashton Kutcher and Jennifer Garner its hard to summon up a sentiment beyond the one muttered by my viewing companion ""Fine mush your boring faces together already."" Advertisement Valentines Day directed by the romantic-comedy veteran Garry Marshall ( Pretty Woman Runaway Bride) and written by Katherine Fugate is firmly committed to the notion of economy of scale. What it lacks in charm humor and intelligence it makes up for in sheer volume. Why settle for one high-schoolers-in-love subplot when you can cram in a second starring Taylor Swift and Taylor Lautner as adorable airheads who serve no apparent narrative function? Why rely on one female character to provide the klutzy physical comedy when you can have three (the highly capable Anne Hathaway the just-competent Jennifer Garner and the intolerable Jessica Biel)? Marshalls attempt to please every conceivable audience is like a 200-piece Whitmans sampler. Whats the point of getting that much candy if you want to discard every piece after the first bite?

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Love weve been told means never having to say youre sorry. So please dont ask Garry Marshall to apologize for the two-hour traffic jam that calls itself ""Valentines Day. Thank him instead for getting together so many performers in the name of epic cuteness. There are tabloid fixtures (Jessica Alba Jessica Biel The teen wolf from ""New Moon) TV people (George Lopez Patrick Dempsey Eric Dane) talented actors (Anne Hathaway Hector Elizondo) a talented songwriter (Taylor Swift) and Oscar winners (Julia Roberts Jamie Foxx Kathy Bates and Shirley MacLaine).There are about five shots of dogs at least 20 times as many shots of flowers and some of the worst acting by a child youll see. All the pink on screen will inspire thoughts of carnations or Pepto Bismol. Greeting cards belch Percy Sledge songs and Swift drags a giant stuffed bear through all her scenes.For those who prefer their romantic comedy in bulk this is a steal. But attention Costco shoppers Quantity here runs a distant second to quality. Which is not to say theres no savings. This is many lousy movies for the price of one.You might not volunteer to see a film in which Ashton Kutcher as the owner of a flower-delivery company pops the question to Albas careerist. But perhaps youd endure it if it came with a side story about say how well the likable Taylor Lautner can tolerate the adorably gawky Swift or how desperate Jennifer Garner is to surprise her lover (Dempsey) only to be surprised herself.Who ends up with whom tends to be telegraphed from the first scene of Katherine Fugates uninspired screenplay. Loosely tying it together is Foxx as a love-phobic TV sports reporter whose boss (Bates) wants him to hit the streets to cover Valentines Day. Will he get roped into the drama involving a washed-up quarterback (Dane) his jaded publicist (Biel) and even more jaded manager (Queen Latifah)? Of course he will.Garner is Biels buddy. Hathaway is Latifahs assistant. And Topher Grace is the man Hathaways been sleeping with for the past two weeks and no he isnt aware that she works as a phone sex operator.Bradley Cooper and Roberts are seatmates on a flight to Los Angeles. She wears a military uniform but he doesnt seem interested in her service. Were meant to believe hes trying to pick her up and shes with someone. But the movie withholds the sort of defining details that would normally pass between two strangers because it would ruin the twist in store for later. In any case the movie cuts away from their conversations so fast and so frequently that its hard to know what theyve discussed. A bored audience might be inspired to notice that ""Valentines Day is like a science experiment combining the antic assortment of Angelenos in Robert Altmans ""Short Cuts with the high-fructose corn syrup of Richard Curtiss ""Love Actually. The resulting entity is less than the sum of the movies it evokes. And those aching to see Angelenos of color and with body fat might find themselves longing for ""Crash even against their better judgment. (The ethnics here have all the body fat but very little of the romance.)Standing in for the natural disaster that concludes ""Short Cuts are epiphanies that measure 9.5 on the I Think I Love You scale.At 75 Marshall is still hooked on a blend of broad comedy and big schmaltz. Anyone born after 1970 could be forgiven for assuming he invented it. On television he created ""Happy Days ""Laverne amp; Shirley and ""Mork amp; Mindy. As a director hes given us ""The Flamingo Kid ""Nothing in Common ""Overboard ""Beaches ""Pretty Woman ""Frankie and Johnny ""Dear God ""The Other Sister ""Runaway Bride ""The Princess Diaries ""Raising Helen and ""Georgia Rule.He uses cheap sight gags crummy jokes and unnecessary reaction shots to make programmatic writing seem more obvious than it already is. But often his schmaltz sells. This is partly because Marshall is an endearing softie and one of the very last men in Hollywood who believes women are funny too. His lack of cynicism allows him to feed us bromides sentimentality and happy endings not so much because its what he thinks we want but because its what he believes. He enjoys a big laugh. But like some of the women who adore his movies he loves a good cry even more.""Valentines Day is unruly but oddly juvenile. Like the substitute-teacher version of Altman Marshall lets everybody go wild in the absence of authority. This cheeky uncle vibe can work for him as it does in part of ""The Princess Diaries. But in lieu of real affection Marshall has pumped the movie full of shameless symbols (an adulterer who juggles a heart-shaped pinata) bad puns and inside-showbiz connections. Kutcher has punked a few of his costars. Roberts and Cooper did a Broadway play together the title of which the captain of their flight announces. Lautner whose shirtless ""Twilight work has made people gasp winkingly tells Swift hed like to keep his clothes on. Foxx has worked with Garner (in ""The Kingdom) and with Biel (in ""Stealth). And the majestic MacLaine stands before a projection of herself in 1958s ""Hot Spell.Some might see movie love in all this trivial interconnection.

Correction Because of a reporting error this review of ""Valentines Day"" in the Feb. 12 ""g"" section named the wrong singer whose voice is heard from a greeting card. Percy Sledge is the singer. (c) Copyright 2010 Globe Newspaper Company. Correction An earlier version of this review of the film ""Valentines Day"" misstated the singer of ""When a Man Loves a Woman."" It is Percy Sledge.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Garry Marshalls star-studded new romantic comedy Valentines Day explores love in all its myriad forms from the sickeningly sappy to the cornball to the groaningly precious and obnoxiously cute. The veteran filmmaker and television guru previously transformed subject matter like Samp;M pleasure islands (Exit To Eden) and prostitution (Pretty Woman) into goofy crowd-pleasing pabulum. So when Marshall is given a big Sweetest Day Hallmark card of a screenplay like Katherine Fugates overstuffed aggregation of saccharine rom-com cliches theres no chance audiences will leave the film with their heartstrings unplucked. Ashton Kutcher leads a sprawling wildly overqualified cast as the worlds nicest most romantic man a successful florist/real-life Cupid whose job lets him interact with a wide variety of broadly drawn types throughout the greater Los Angeles area. The films roster of lovestruck and lovelorn goofs include a daffy young woman (Anne Hathaway) who tries to keep her job as a phone-sex operator a secret from her unsuspecting boyfriend (Topher Grace). (No small feat when she has to sneak out and service her clients during their dates) Then theres luckless single gal Jennifer Garner a middle-school teacher with a very married boyfriend (Patrick Dempsey extending his range by playing a handsome doctor) and Jessica Biel who devolves into a nightmare spiral of chocoholism because she cant lure a fellow into her mantrap on Valentines Day. Haphazardly toss in 15 more subplots half a dozen wacky canine-reaction shots a wall-to-wall soundtrack of romantic golden oldies and an adorable young moppet who just wants to have flowers delivered to the girl of his dreams and you have a fluffy souffle of shameless sentiment and sitcom wackiness executed with the kind of flailing desperation thats generally accompanied by an overactive laugh track. Valentines Day looks like Marshalls directors magnum opus of pandering schlock. Decades into his career hes finally achieved his lifelong dream of roping half of Hollywood into helping him make an unofficial cinematic adaptation of Love American Style.

Valentines Day Director Garry Marshall. Cast Julia Roberts Ashton Kutcher Jessica Alba. Rating Rated PG-13 for some sexual material and brief partial nudity. Chick flicks Movies with more than one hot chick Spotlight Jessica Alba Spotlight Jessica Biel Spotlight Jamie Foxx Spotlight Kathy Bates After seeing the film youll still think so - but for a thank-you call for not getting them involved in such a silly disorganized mess. The movie is set in a Los Angeles where Feb. 14 exists as a sort of undeclared national holiday touching everyone in some meaningful way. It brings happiness to those in love and misery to those who arent (though the status of several characters will go back and forth throughout). ""Its Valentines Day"" one character says. ""You dont think. You act."" Alas director Garry Marshall seems to have taken that advice to heart. Especially the dont-think part. The film is an interlocking series of set pieces some more entertaining than others but only a couple come close to being memorable. Flower-shop owner Reed (Ashton Kutcher) uses the day to propose to his career-obsessed girlfriend Morley (Alba). Reeds friend Julia (Jennifer Garner) is in love with a divorced doctor (Patrick Dempsey). Reed and Julias friendship anchors the story to the extent that anything does. Also in the works A football player (Eric Dane) who has been released from his team calls a major press conference complicating the traditional Valentines Day misery fest his publicist (Jessica Biel) always puts on but offering a lower-rung sports reporter (Foxx) his big chance. Meanwhile a wife (MacLaine) chooses the day to let her husband (Hector Elizondo) in on a secret better kept quiet. Grace (Emma Roberts) and her boyfriend (Carter Jenkins) plan to lose their virginity during lunch break at school while their best friends (Swift and Lautner) make out and cavort for the local TV station doing a story on . . . Valentines Day. Am I forgetting anything? Probably as most of what goes on here is forgettable. The two most intriguing stories relatively speaking involve a recent transplant from Indiana (Topher Grace) who overhears his new girlfriend (Anne Hathaway) at work - as a phone-sex operator. And theres a genuinely nice payoff to the story of a man (Cooper) recently single on a long plane flight with an Army captain (Julia Roberts). But as you might guess by now theres far too much going on in ""Valentines Day"" and far too little of it is worth the trouble. Grace and Hathaway are charming as are Kutcher and Garner. Everyone else is just going through the motions. Theyre given little to do and they make the least of it. Marshall working from a script by Katherine Fugate probably would have done better to pare some of the elements to concentrate more fully on . . . something. His golf game maybe. Better yet Marshall should have just settled for roses and chocolates and called it a day. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter goodyk.

As gooey and lacking in protein as a chocolate holiday bonbon ""Valentines Day"" plays like a feature-length commercial produced by the Friends of the Valentine Promotional Society. Almost every scene is larded by talk of flowers gifts cards restaurants and other ways to spend gobs of money on a single day all delivered by a raft of attractive stars or semi-stars rotated on and off by director Garry Marshall. Never was there a film more release date-targeted than this one which only means that once opening weekend is gone so will be the audience. A compendium of lovers found lost and avenged on a day designed to make you feel bad if you dont have anyone this would rate high on any list of pictures featuring the greatest number of talented actors given the least interesting things to do as well as the most gaping differential between the beauty of many of the performers and the way theyre made to look. It would be interesting to know why the New Line Cinema titles now released by Warner Bros. invariably look worse than actual Warner Bros. productions; the sets seem cheaper the lighting gaudier the color processing worse the soundtrack compendiums patchier. All this does no favors to the parade of beauties here as Jessica Alba Jessica Biel Jennifer Garner Anne Hathaway Emma and Julia Roberts and Taylor Swift on the female side and Bradley Cooper Eric Dane Patrick Dempsey Jamie Foxx Topher Grace Ashton Kutcher and Taylor Lautner among the guys have all been seen to better advantage elsewhere. And thats before they even open their mouths. Screenwriter Katherine Fugate had to have spent more time figuring out how to shuffle all the characters on and offscreen with a measure of balance and coherence than giving them anything amusing to say. Virtually all the women speak with the same snippy frayed-nerves cadence which most of the guys respond to with more bland agreeability -- or in a couple of cases evasiveness -- than imagination. Only Hathaway gets a reprieve from the norm playing a young woman who earns extra money providing ""adult phone entertainment"" in different accents. Tiresomely however her would-be b.f. (the underused Grace) is a Midwestern hick offended by the source of her needed income; the relationship could have been much funnier if upon overhearing her lurid monologues he got excited and aided and abetted her or perhaps signed up for her services. As it is there is perhaps one surprise embedded in the extended romantic roundelay Finding out her lover (Dempsey) is married a betrayed woman (Garner) plots her revenge; a florist (Kutcher) through whose shop several of the characters pass proposes to his g.f. (Alba) who may have mixed feelings; a neurotic publicist (Biel who seems the least neurotic of actresses) guides her free-agent football star client (Dane) through a momentous press conference at which a TV reporter (Foxx) plays a key role; a high school couple (Emma Roberts Carter Jenkins) plot to lose their virginity over the lunch hour while their classmates (Lautner Swift) cavort on the playground; a fellow (Cooper) becomes intrigued by the identity of the person his airplane seatmate (an Army captain played by Julia Roberts) is traveling halfway around the world to see for one day; and a woman (Shirley MacLaine) ill-advisedly lets a long-hidden cat out of the bag as a Valentines Day gift to her husband. Some teen viewers may be drawn by the lure of the two Taylors but their time onscreen together arguably reps the films low point; Swift especially seems entirely undirected as she jumps around makes faces and jabbers on inanely. If shes to have a film career she needs to find a skilled director to tamp her down and channel her obviously abundant energy. Marshall functions more as a benign host than as a disciplined director here inviting his thesps to spend some profitable time at such scenic L.A. spots as the Beverly Wilshire Hotel the Bistro Gardens Disney Hall the Flower Mart the dog park under the Hollywood sign the Venice canals Bobs Big Boy and the Hollywood Forever Cemetery where (as in real life) old movies are shown at night. The one in question here is the 1958 ""Hot Spell"" in which the very young MacLaine is seen being romanced while the more mature version tries to reconcile with her hurt husband.
