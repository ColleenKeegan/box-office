And the witch in ""Season of the Witch spends her time in a rolling 14th-century jail. Nicolas Cage plays a holy knight who after one chuckling montage of slow-motion Crusade battles has decided that hes tired of all the knighting. He and a wise-cracking co-worker (Ron Perlman) find themselves conscripted to take the town witch (Claire Foy) to a far away abbey in order to rid the kingdom of the plague.The movie doesnt come with 3-D glasses a control pad or much in the way of a screenplay (by Bragi F. Schut) or direction (from Dominic Sena). It is however loud and full of damp fabric and damper hair. We are not the only ones who go without. Cage spends most of the film without the products and appliances that give his hair that Nickleback quality of both the early scenes and a few of his recent movies. His character here accidentally kills a woman turning him off to killing altogether even as were told for Christ. This is presumably why he puts up with the caged womans taunts guilt.His remorse doesnt extend to the filmmakers. The men credited for typing the movie up supply Foy a young Englishwoman with a part she cant seem to figure out. The credits refer to her character as ""The Girl which is nicer than shes called by a few of the men hauling her around. One minute The Girl is superhumanly strong. The other shes superhumanly meek pleading to be released from her cage-cart. ""Some good deeds can be done she tells Sir Nicolas. ""Even from behind bars. A line like that might give even some strippers pause.After a while the movie tires of the witch business and trots out a plot twist that permits the effects department to spend money. Some moviegoers might find the bait-and-switch funny. Some might wish the studio had been a little more upfront.

Wait for it. You know its coming. In every Nicolas Cage movie theres going to be the moment when he starts screaming when he loses it when rage and despair engulf him. This has become so much his trademark probably unintentionally that a compilation of those moments went viral a couple months ago. (It has been watched by nearly 1.8 million viewers on YouTube.) Cage who turns 47 Friday has been making movies for three decades. It has been a checkered career though he has had his share of box-office hits and deservedly earned a Best Oscar win for 1995s ""Leaving Las Vegas."" Of late there havent been a lot of high points. The nephew of Francis Ford Coppola Cage got into the business early showing up in ""Fast Times in Ridgemont High"" in 1982. From the start with his pinched nasal voice and sharp-featured countenance he was an odd presence on screen and not it would seem a natural leading man. I remember the movie in which he won me over 1986s ""Peggy Sue Got Married."" In this time-travel comedy directed from his uncle Cage was Kathleen Turner doofus of a high school boyfriend and later husband. He played the role with fierce abandon glorying in the characters stubborn-headed dumbness. As both Turners character and audiences discovered there was no point resisting him because he was never ever going to give up. I think to some extent that explains Cages long-lasting appeal even in the hoariest of programmers. Hes never gonna give up hell scream if he has to and hes always going to be a hero in his own mind. He is going to keep coming at you and at the role until he wears you down.  Hes going to be as weird as he wants to be. Its as if he is Chris Walken but reborn as a leading man rather than a character actor. ""Peggy Sue"" marked the beginning of the golden period in Cages career when he starred in quirky comedy after quirky comedy including ""Raising Arizona"" and ""Moonstruck."" Then he turned into an action hero first in a series of popular albeit preposterous Jerry Bruckheimer-produced films such as 1996s ""The Rock"" and 1997s ""Con Air"" and more recently in the ""National Treasure"" series and ""Ghost Rider."" Along the way there have been fascinating more complex performances in smaller darker films such as ""Leaving Las Vegas"" in which he played a man intent on drinking himself to death. Also worth seeing are 2002s ""Adaptation"" 2005s ""Lord of War"" and 2009s remake of ""The Bad Lieutenant Port of Call -- New Orleans."" But at least half his output these days is in lousy cookie-cutter films. (News accounts of his financial troubles would seem possibly to explain his willingness to sign on for such projects all of which offer a higher pay day than an indie film.) The new silly ""Season of the Witch"" is another forgettable trifle from Cage. In it he plays a knight in the 14th century whos weary after years of fighting in the Crusades. Hes fed up with being asked to slaughter in Gods name. He and a fellow knight (Ron Perlman whos amusing) are given one last mission to escort a teenage girl accused of being a witch to a remote monastery. Shes to be tried there as the monasterys monks possess the last copy of an ancient book containing a spell capable of overcoming the demon possibly possessing the girl. All of which means an arduous journey during which Cage and his companions encounger various mysterious deaths the black plague multiple sword fights rampaging wolves (all thats missing is ""Twilights"" Taylor Lautner) and lots of special effects-created demons. Theres also plenty of anachronistic tough guy joking and dialogue (""S--"" Cage exclaims at one point) gloomy castle and village sets that look like they are left over from ""Van Helsing"" and -- you knew it was coming -- Cage losing it. He does so several times but my favorite comes when enraged he un-Cages his fury and yells at a lecturing priest ""No man has spilled more blood in Gods name than I"" Someone needs to add that clip to Cages losing-it video montage.

( Egon Endrenyi / Lionsgate ) ltc only one pix available for now Photo Credit LIONSGATE/Egon Endrenyi advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A 14th century knight encounters a young girl who may be a witch. BOTTOM LINE Goofy gooey fun with Cage and Perlman making a surprisingly good team. CAST Nicolas Cage Ron Perlman Claire Foy WHEN/WHERE ""Season of the Witch"" showtimes and tickets LENGTH 131 Reason meets superstition in ""Season of the Witch"" starring Nicolas Cage as a 14th-century knight who encounters a young girl possessed by evil. Or is she? Yes she is which would be a spoiler if it werent revealed so early in the movie. But even lacking that suspense ""Season of the Witch"" still offers spooky forests rabid hellhounds zombie-monks and the sight of Cage emoting through 50 pounds of chain-mail. In other words not the worst way to spend 91 minutes during a slow movie month. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Cage and Ron Perlman (""Hellboy"") play Behmen and Felson rough-riding mead-quaffing Crusaders known for slaughtering infidels and closing down taverns in hot spots like Smyrna and Edremidt. But after taking part in a kind of Middle Ages My Lai massacre they desert their outfit in search of more peaceable pastures. Instead they stumble into a village cursed by plague apparently the work of a nameless young witch (Claire Foy). After some strong-arming from a dying cardinal (Christopher Lee under layers of latex pustules) the renegade knights agree to transport her to a far-off abbey to stand trial. Theyre accompanied by a young priest (Stephen Campbell Moore) a shady guide (Stephen Graham) a grieving father (Ulrich Thomsen) and an altar boy (Robert Sheehan). Not all will survive but you knew that. Director Dominic Sena (""Gone in 60 Seconds"") sets a quick pace; the dull moments are brightened by the unexpectedly likable team of Cage and Perlman. As for the ending its ridiculous. Perhaps you can find forgiveness in your heart. VideoTrailer Season of the Witch His kingdom for a horse (and sword) advertisement | advertise on newsday ""Season of the Witch"" presented actor Nicolas Cage with an opportunity to learn new skills. ""I wanted to learn sword fighting; I wanted to learn how to ride a horse - all those things I had not done before"" he says. Cage spent weeks training in England with Camilla Naprous and her team of horse trainers. He practiced weaving around poles and riding quietly through forests for up to seven hours a day. He also worked with a fight choreographer to perfect his swordsmanship. The swords used in the film are based on European arms of the period. Cages decorative weapon was called a ""one-and-a-half-hand"" sword because it was wielded with one hand and supported with the other. ""I worked quite a bit on the swording and the riding because I felt it was the only real way people would believe it"" he says. ""Thats what knights do They ride horses and swing swords."" Newsday Tweets from Newsday/newsday-staff He says his horse Dali - named for Salvador Dali - is owed some of the credit for making him look good. ""Dali was always very secure and confident so we had a good connection"" he says. - Entertainment News Wire Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

"Season of the Witch | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; season-of-the-witch ) Season of the Witch (United States 2011) January 08 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Its the 14th century somewhere in the middle of Europe. In the name of verisimilitude the filmmakers of Season of the Witch have covered everyone with dirt and filmed only at night and on cloudy days. At times it looks like Monty Python and the Holy Grail only the Knights Who Say ""Ni"" are nowhere to be found. Oh and one other thing Everyone speaks vaguely Shakespearean-sounding English with an American accent just as Chaucer always intended. Meanwhile method actor that he is Nicolas Cage has eschewed the use of a razor and possibly decided to avoid baths and showers during the course of the Hungary/Austria shoot. His dedication to his craft shines through as is evident in the occasional wrinkling of Ron Perlmans nose. There are positives and negatives to hiring Nicolas Cage. On the one hand hes a recognizable name with an Oscar on his resume and a proven (albeit uneven) box office draw. On the other hand when hes on autopilot - which has been most of the time in recent years - he can be awful. He also has a severely limited range that does not include traipsing around Europe with a witch in tow during the Crusades. Cage is effective as a falling down drunk in Las Vegas or a treasure hunter navigating goofy road trips but not as a disillusioned champion of the Church going one-on-one with a demon. Steven Seagal would have been more believable. When it comes to acting Cage is by far the worst offender in this endeavor but hes not the only one. With the exception of Ron Perlman who often looks to be searching for a cigar to chomp on the performances are uniformly lifeless. The mood is so solemn and serious that when a character cracks a joke (including one appropriated from Jaws) it feels awkward and out-of-place. Only Perlman seems to recognize that the only way Season of the Witch can work is to treat the material as parody Monty Python and the Season of the Witch. Unfortunately hes the only one on that page and not even director Dominic Sena has joined him. The result most of the cast is exuding gloom and doom Perlman is off doing Python-inspired shtick and Cage is trying to figure out if his bank account has enough zeroes in front of the decimal point for him to begin doing good movies again. As Season of the Witch begins Behmen (Nicolas Cage) and Felson (Ron Perlman) are two of Gods most reliable warriors in the Crusades - until they experience an epiphany and recognize that all of the killing is pointless. They desert and head home but along the way they are pressed into service by the decrepit Cardinal DAmbroise (Christopher Lee rightfully hoping no one will recognize him) who wants them to join a group of four others to transport a suspected witch (Claire Foy) to a nearby city where she can be tried for heresy. DAmbroise suspects she may be responsible for the Black Plague and with her death its ravages can be stopped. The trip is arduous with various obstacles presenting themselves including a none-too-stable rope bridge across a canyon a huge pack of wolves and an end game that doesnt go as planned. It all comes down to a battle against a demon who talks like a New Yawk City beat cop with a megaphone. Underneath the underwhelming production design and the aimless narrative a couple of intriguing ideas are disposed of with little fanfare. The conceit that a knight might recognize the underlying corruption of the Crusades - it was a power-play by a racist and dictatorial Church - is not without merit; unfortunately it becomes a secondary plot point serving little purpose beyond explaining how Behmen and Felson end up on witch escort duty. The second potentially intriguing concept relates to the initial ambiguity surrounding the supposed witch who is comely and terrified. Does she truly possess supernatural powers or is she an innocent caught up in a literal witch hunt? And if she is a witch does that necessarily mean she is touched by the Devil? Sadly Season of the Witch barely has time to ask these questions before it answers them in a predictable unsatisfactory manner. What Season of the Witch essentially tries to do is graft a road trip onto a medieval setting with standard fantasy adventure types. If not for the ripe dialogue the lack of interesting occurrences and the blandness of the characters it might have worked. Instead we get a journey in which the most momentous and exciting event is when the witchs mobile jail has trouble making it across a rope bridge. The climactic ten minutes represent a spiral into absurdity and self-parody that isnt helped by some cheesy special effects and a complete lack of originality. Season of the Witch teeters on the edge of slipping into the ""so bad its good"" camp but ultimately ends up being merely bad and an early contender for a place on the 2011 Bottom 10 list.

Comments (1) click to enlarge Season of the Witch Video Rated PG-13  95 minutes  2011 Nicolas Cage stars as a 14th-century knight who along with brother-in-arms Ron Perlman goes AWOL from the Crusades after too much senseless carnage. After the deserters are apprehended their only way out of prison is to escort a young woman accused of witchcraft (Claire Foy) to trial at a distant monastery. From that potentially interesting premise director Dominic Sena (Gone in 60 Seconds Whiteout) concocts a lifeless action-cum-horror film as the travelers face the Plague ferocious wolves and demons both spectral and internal--all to sadly predictable outcomes. As usual Cage alternates between leaden line readings and thunderous outbursts making his accomplished costars Ulrich Thomsen and Stephen Campbell Moore look even better. But the movies worst aspect is the CGI which packs no scares whatsoever.

Cage just isnt very fun when hes this subdued and archly serious - even the risible and ill-conceived 2006 remake of The Wicker Man managed to prove that an over-the-top Cage is better than one who seems bored by his own movie.Cage stars as Behman a disillusioned 14th-century knight who along with his friend and fellow warrior Felson (Ron Perlman) has abandoned the Crusades and the church after 10 years of warfare and slaughter. While making their way back to their homeland they are arrested as deserters and pressed into a mission by a dying Cardinal (Christopher Lee unrecognizable under some nasty prosthetics).The land has been ravaged by the Black Death and the masses believe it to be the work of witchcraft. Behman and Felson are given the task of transporting the accused witch - a frightened young girl named Anna (Claire Foy) - to a remote monastery for trial and punishment.For Behman the opportunity to protect an innocent is a chance for redemption for the atrocities he committed in the name of God. He and Felson are accompanied by the standard ragtag band of heroes specifically an idealistic young priest (Stephen Campbell Moore) a noble knight (Ulrich Thomsen) a shifty guide (Stephen Graham) and an altar boy (Robert Sheehan) who yearns to be knighted. It quickly becomes apparent that there might be more to the girl than meets the eye. Disappointingly it turns out to be less since there is a distinct lack of suspense and ambiguity in the goings-on.The pulpy plot sounds good on paper and could have made for a great slice of B-grade action-fantasy fun but it is so blandly executed that neither the story nor the characters ever come fully to life. Its populated by the dullest group of questing heroes this side of amateur night at a Dungeons amp; Dragons tournament.The actors are outperformed by the scenery (which is impressively beautiful or vile as needed) thanks to underwritten characters and shockingly inconsistent accents (Englishman Grahams vaguely New York inflection is the most puzzling) that drop viewers out of the fantasy. Its not a good sign when even the CGI demon featured in the climax seems to stumble over its lines.Despite sporadic fun Season of the Witch ultimately is so remote and uninvolving that it feels as if one is watching the story unfold from a distance. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

(AP) Ron Perlman left and Nicolas Cage in a scene from ""Season of the Witch.""(AP) Movie review Season of the Witch As if you havent had enough turkey lately Add to ... Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jan. 07 2011 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 241PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Not to be confused with the Donovan song or a history of the Thatcher years Season of the Witch ventures all the way back to the 14th century when the Ages were middling the Plague was deadly black and Crusaders were still slaughtering in the name of the risen Christ. Among the latter are a pair of good old boys a mangy-haired Nicolas Cage as Behmen (rhymes with demon) and a close-cropped Ron Perlman as his comrade-in-poleaxing. Together they battle hordes of CGI infidels taking an occasional break from the hand-to-hand combat for a hand-to-breast orgy. Its a pretty good life until it isnt. The same might be said of this movie. Movies Season of the Witch The official trailer The pretty good stuff comes early when Nic and Ron weary of wasting women and children suffer an attack of conscience and desert the Crusades punctuating the rift with a secular vow ""I serve the Church no more."" Well this is a useful reminder of a religions terrorist past and were definitely curious to see where the plot will take the two heretics and their freshly minted scruples. Initially they head back home to a Europe so devastated by the plague that it looks like a George Romero set - pustulating corpses mad dogs everywhere the living dead. On the bright side the Church has a ready explanation for the scourge ""Its a curse called up from Hell brought against us by the Black Witch."" Unaware of this keen medical insight and unwisely wandering into an Abbey our erstwhile warriors are captured by the Cardinals henchmen then offered a choice instant death or the job of transporting said Witch (Claire Foy) to a distant city for a trial by those fairest of jurors a conclave of tonsured monks. Hey cue the road movie. So off the group treks across craggy mountain passes and through wolf-ridden forests with the accused girl in a caged wagon and the boys riding shotgun. En route director Dominic Sena actually generates some classic suspense by dusting off and rejuvenating a familiar trope - the ol rickety swing bridge strung over a perilous gorge. His camera work is uncluttered his cutting is clean and for a few delightful minutes darned if we arent kids again watching a Saturday serial with our hearts in our throats. Suspenseful too at least temporarily is the ambiguity over the true nature of the comely prisoner behind those wooden bars. Is the gal a wronged innocent a designing woman or a supernatural force? When she accuses a young priest of sexual abuse the answer points in the modern direction of victimhood. When she beckons Nic over to her cage and seductively purrs ""Allow me to ease your pain"" the pendulum swings to the femme fatale part of the spectrum. The audience is tossed about on this shifting psychological ground and had the script stayed there the film might have fulfilled its potential. Instead the third act takes a commercial turn and goes all horror-flick on us. Nice try but this formulaic decision comes with four consequences (1) to reposition us from the edge of our seats to a slumbering posture; (2) to essentially undermine the logic of everything that came before; (3) to completely invalidate the humanist stance of the two protagonists; and (4) to inadvertently recast the Church from terrorizing villain into de facto hero. No matter. To hell with logic damn the theme - the action quota must be filled. And so it is right up to the mark where in the throes of devilish combat someone is made to yell ""We are going to need more holy water"" By then the writing is on the monastery wall and Hollywoods miracle of transubstantiation gets repeated yet again Another movie is turned into a turkey.

By Peter Rainer Film critic January 7 2011 Save for later Saved From left Stephen Campbell Moore Nicolas Cage and Ron Perlman are shown in a scene from Season of the Witch. Egon Endrenyi/Relativity Media/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Nicolas Cage is one of those actors who is fun to watch even in a dreadful movie. Hes made his fair share.I was looking forward to ""Season of the Witch"" because it featured Cage as a lapsed 13th-century Crusader in a Black Death-ridden world infested with demons. Sounded promisingly awful.As it turns out the film is not altogether dreadful although its far from good. And thats not good. Classic stinkeroos are rarer than masterpieces and we all need a laugh now and then even if the laughs are inadvertent. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? But dont worry. Theres plenty of badness to go around in ""Season of the Witch."" Its just that Cage despite being encased in armor and hides and grime and burlap with hair that looks as if it hasnt been shorn since the 12th century is surprisingly - disappointingly - restrained. Despite his intonations which at times as usual seem to echo Elvis hes even halfway believable. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Cages Behmen and his longtime fighting buddy Felson (Ron Perlman) have gone AWOL from the Crusades because after decades its finally dawned on them that women and children are also being massacred in the name of God. Returning to their homeland they discover it has become a wasteland of plague and pestilence. And just in case we didnt get the point director Dominic Sena and his creative team never pass up the opportunity to showcase close-ups of corpses that might have been hauled in from ""Saw 3.""While searching for food the two knights are reeled in by the local cardinal played by Christopher Lee no less and given a choice Go to jail for desertion or escort a local girl (Claire Foy) accused of being a witch to stand trial in a distant abbey. To get there accompanied by several expendable stalwarts the men must traverse sheer-walled gorges and ravines and forests where wolves are so plentiful that youd think the knights stumbled into a ""Twilight"" convention. They must also traverse acres and acres of very bad dialogue.My favorite line delivered with a straight face comes when a demon proves to be more formidable than anticipated. ""Were going to need more holy water.""It would take a lot more than holy water to rescue ""Season of the Witch"" from mediocrity.

Photo Lions Gate/courtesy Everett Col In 1332 it is the Age of the Crusades. The doughty pair of knights played by Nicolas Cage and Ron Perlman in ""Season of the Witch"" -- a movie that appears to have been shot entirely on leftover sets from ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" -- regard the infidel hordes before them and snicker. ""You take the 300 on the left Ill take the 300 on the right."" Obviously but whoever kills fewer Muslims has to buy the drinks at the crucial apres-massacre quaffing. Never mind. ""Ill kill them all myself"" says Cage. So The Middle Ages were ""Lethal Weapon"" with crossbows. Fine. But dont expect us to be too scared when the knights disillusioned by excessive killing in Gods name are assigned to deal with an accused young witch (Claire Foy who looks about as dangerous as the bass player in a Courtney Love band). They must transport her to an abbey that is home to a book of spells that will unplug her evil as shes executed. The charges against the witch seem sketchy. She appeared in the village muttering to herself -- after which came the plague. The knights point out that other villages were beset by plague even though no punky bass players showed up. So there will be no judgment without a fair trial Behmen (Cage) keeps telling the girl. Because there were so many of those in witchcraft prosecutions. In the 14th century. Despite her apparent innocence spooky stuff keeps happening. One knight goes nuts looking for his departed daughter. Also as the gang its horses its cart and its prisoner rumble over a rickety rope bridge spanning a bottomless chasm (straight out of ""Holy Grail"") the captive girl seems to have superhuman strength. Sorcery? Pilates? Stay tuned. This is one of those movies in which subsidiary characters of no interest to anyone especially the screenwriter exist entirely to get killed one by one as we tramp our way through various unimaginative scenes of peril. The rope bridge leads to nothing except a dull restaging of an event from 100 other movies. Its a rotting string of planks that looks as if it couldnt hold a squirrel yet Cage and Perlman bring a couple thousand pounds of men beasts and equipment over it only to have it snap one second after everyone is safely over. Wheres the skill? When the dialogue isnt abysmally jokey (""Did you see that priest? He looked like someone pissed in his holy water"") it clangs like chain mail on an anvil ""We have come a long way seeing things few men have seen"" says Perlman referring perhaps to Cages ""The Sorcerers Apprentice."" Director Dominic Sena (""Gone in Sixty Seconds"" ""Whiteout"") saves up most of his effects budget for the final scene which contains a little twist and delivers the only semi-scary stuff in the movie. Finally confronted with the real malefactor which is much cooler than anything we saw in the first hour and 20 minutes a priest says ""Were going to need more holy water."" Nice update on the famous line in ""Jaws."" Except if youre a priest you can create all the holy water you want. Audiences considering ""Season of the Witch"" should heed the timeless advice of its ancestor ""Holy Grail"" -- run away As for Cages career tumbling down the cinematic gorge from ""Ghost Rider"" to ""Bangkok Dangerous"" to ""National Treasure 2"" the brave knight Behmen sums it up perfectly ""There is no hope here only the plague.""

Stephen Campbell Moore Nicolas Cage and Ron Perlman. (Endrenyi/AP) Joe Neumaier Friday January 7 2011 400 AM Title Season of the Witch Two knights must deliver a witch to a monastery for de-possession. With Nicolas Cage Ron Perlman. Director Dominic Sena. (138). PG-13 Violence. At area theaters.This is getting embarrassing.We all know what Nicolas Cage has become onscreen -- wild-haired out-there middle-aged crazy 98% of the time; murky mysterious weird-but-watchable the other 2%.Why? Some fans claim his off-screen tax troubles have forced the oddball Oscar-winner (""Leaving Las Vegas"" remember?) into new levels of uh Caginess. But many think this was where the man was headed anyway.Still ... ""Season of the Witch""? Really?Its likely Cage wanted to wear a tunic and read incantations from dusty books and fight demons with swords and thats in here; it is January after all and Hollywoods plumb out of true grit and kings speeches. Time for dumb fun.Except that rather than elevating this wanna-be Hammer horror flick Cage somehow lowers its quality.As youd expect in a movie called ""Season of the Witch"" -- except of course for ""Halloween III Season of the Witch"" -- theres a witch. Unnamed but plug-ugly the enchantress is hung for her ways in the year 1235. She apparently returns as a young girl a century later just as wisecracking best-bud Crusaders Behmen (Cage) and Felson (Ron Perlman) find a Plague-plagued village.The local priest blames the girl for bringing the Black Death to their town so Behmen and Felson deserters from the churchs army take the job of getting her to a monastery. There an ancient tome known only to a handful of monks can de-witchify her and save humanity from bulbous-faced destruction and a bad hacking cough.There are fellow travelers including a merchant-turned-guide and a sneaky priest but theyre really just bodies to sacrifice to the winged devil that is the storys big prize. Director Dominic Sena (""Gone in Sixty Seconds"" -- which is sadly a movie title not the running time here) makes sure the path to that monastery is filled with howls and fog and inane episodic distractions.At least ""Witch"" offers Perlmans easy early-hominid charm and a semi-suspenseful rickety-bridge scene.The real cliff-hanger though remains Cages career. How much indignity can it take? Surely he can find ""Matchstick Men""-like scripts with more trickery than this or ""Adaptation""-ish roles that require comic edge. You dont need an eye of newt and toe of frog to see that the paycheck roles arent paying off the way they should. (Next up Februarys ""Drive Angry."")That is unless filling a filmography with this kind of hell-broth is the ultimate goal.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Good question Updated  | Comment  | Recommend E-mail | Print | Enlarge By Egon Endrenyi Relativity Media Stephen Campbell Moore left Nicolas Cage and Ron Perlman play ex-Crusaders who must deliver a young woman accused of witchcraft to trial. ABOUT THE MOVIESeason of the Witch   (out of four) Stars Nicolas Cage Ron Perlman Claire Foy Director Dominic SenaDistributor Relativity MediaRunning time 1 hour 38 minutesRating PG-13 for thematic elements violence and disturbing content.Opens nationwide Friday By Scott Bowles USA TODAY Nicolas Cage is a man of mercurial taste an actor whose career choices careen from the astute (Leaving Las Vegas Raising Arizona) to the astounding (Ghost Rider The Sorcerers Apprentice). He drifts back into the baffling with Season of the Witch a mishmash of horror and history genres thats not as bad as its trailers but ultimately is dragged down by of all things its star. This fish-out-of-water casting shouldnt be a problem for Cage who regularly flourishes in unlikely roles. But he and co-star Ron Perlman are a little too clever too sardonic and way too contemporary to convince as swordsmen in the 1300s. Though Witch has some nice twists particularly in the finale it plays more like a buddy-cop film set during the Crusades. GALLERY View pictures of Nicolas Cage throughout his career Cage plays Behmen a skilled fighter and devout Christian called to duty with battle pal Felson (Perlman). Behmen unintentionally lances a lass and realizes hes in the stabbing business prompting him and Felson to renounce the church and give up the blade. The pair are soon arrested. To avoid prison for desertion they undertake the task of taking a suspected witch (the lovely Claire Foy looking a lot like Twilights Kristen Stewart) across the European countryside for trial at a distant abbey. The landscape is beautiful the battle sequences serviceable and theres real potential in screenwriter Bragi Schuts story which posits that supernatural forces were behind the plagues that ravaged the region. But theres something jarringly anachronistic about 14th-century knights who fight back-against-back cracking wise over who buys the liquor that night while dicing non-believers. The unkempt witches -- who look like they walked off acne commercial shoots -- dont help the authenticity. All of this could be overlooked if director Dominic Sena (Kalifornia Gone in 60 Seconds) werent determined to make this a showcase for his stars. When the film leaves its anchors and gets to demon hunting it crackles. Its not enough. Like the studios that cast him Cage seems determined to troll the fantasy milieu in search of a viable fantasy franchise. If Witch is any indication that hunt continues.

"Season of the Witch review Cage plays medieval man on a mission |       NJ.com comments Season of the Witch review Cage plays medieval man on a mission Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on January 07 2011 at 800 AM View/Post Comments Nicolas Cage in ""Season of the Witch."" Behman has had enough of war and murder in the name of God. So the weary knight has walked away from it all trudging home with only his sword and his best friend Felson. Until they stop fatefully at a village riddled with the Black Plague. And are forced into taking on one last mission -- the transport of a suspected witch to a distant monastery for judgment. Behman and Felsons Crusades are over. Their trials are just beginning. This is the pleasantly unusual premise for ""Season of the Witch"" one of those rare action films that isnt in bad 3-D drawn out over two hours or based on a comic book half-forgotten TV show or single-shooter video game. Give it credit for that at least and add half a star for modesty. Unlike todays puffed-up ""Country Strong"" this is a movie that knows exactly what its job is and dutifully sticks to it. A little more style and verve and it might actually be a bit of a find. Movie Review Season of the Witch (U(PG-13) Relativity Media/Rogue (98 min.) Directed by Dominic Sena. With Nicolas Cage Ron Perlman. Now playing in New Jersey. Rating note The film contains violence and vulgar language. Stephen Whittys Review TWO AND A HALF STARS Unfortunately director Dominic Sena never builds a real mood of mystery. (While the film may not be based on a computer game some of the sequences -- a haunted wood a wolf attack a rickety bridge -- have the obligatory feel of levels that need to be negotiated.) The period details and background are a bit shaky too. Our knights seem to have walked all the way from the Middle East to Middle Europe (and into a morass of clashing accents). Modern action-movie dialogue (""Lets get the hell out of here"") doesnt help. Really at its worst the whole things a little bit like ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" -- minus the jokes. But at its best Nicolas Cage -- sporting a sun-tinted weave and a massive sword as the hard dazed knight -- is a good well-armored hero as Behman. And Ron Perlman is a dependable delight as the scene-stealing Felson less a picture of chivalry than a prototype of every battle-hardened Sarge the movies ever gave us. Of course ""Season of the Witch"" is itself just a popcorn movie (and one overwhelmed at the end by too much unconvincing CGI and too many concessions to PG-13 restrictions). And for Cage its clearly a paycheck picture -- the sort he needs to make a lot of these days. But at least it knows its a popcorn movie and Cage knows he still has to earn that salary. He mostly does too. Who knows perhaps he was inspired by the work ethic of the actor playing the films dying Cardinal under pounds of disfiguring makeup -- horrors last legend the formidable Christopher Lee still putting in a full days lurk at 88.

Schut; Release Date Wide 01/07/2011; Distributor Lions Gate Films Posted January 12 2011 -- 1200 AM EST By now there are whole genres of bad Nicolas Cage movies -- bad action flicks bad apocalyptic thrillers bad franchise comic-book capers -- and now Season of the Witch seems to invent a new one the bad wisecracking medieval demonic-possession movie. Its got videogame-from-hell F/X plus jousting plus Cage in tangled long hair he seems to have mistakenly put in the washing machine. In the 14th century Cage and Ron Perlman play heroes of the Crusades-turned-cynical deserters who wind up shepherding a young woman who may be a witch to the abbey where shes set to stand trial. The worst thing about Season of the Witch is that its a wagon-wheeled road movie listless and meandering. The best thing about it is Claire Foys performance as the seething caged is-she-a-witch?. Foy like a Brit Kristen Stewart has an entrancing sparkle of disdain. The special effects come mostly at the end which makes them feel like a payoff for sitting through the film. Youve seen it all before of course in movies from Clash of the Titans to Legend. In Hollywood the onslaught of flashy CGI ghoulies knows no season.

Daily Edition Login to download Season of the Witch Film Review 129 PM PST 1/6/2011 by Kirk Honeycutt FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS A CGI freakout at the finale cant save this mundane medieval thriller about witches devils and disillusioned knights. TWITTER The real suspense generated by ""Season of the Witch"" a supernatural thriller set in the 14th century comes from a single source How far will the filmmakers go to the dark side which is to say total camp? As a motley crew of thinly written characters journeys across Plague-ridden Europe the tilt is increasingly campy but the line that finally decides things is this ""Were going to need more holy water."" The films own needs go far beyond holy water as the only successful elements here are the production design and locations in Hungary and Austria which truly please the eye. Or at least they do when the scenery isnt blocked by Nicolas Cage and his fellow actors as they struggle to breath life into stale material and trite characters. Cage whose career choices are increasingly alarming no longer assures major box office so this Relativity Media release may experience a disappointing opening weekend despite a major marketing push. Overseas coin may well outstrip the modest domestic box office but that does Relativity no good as it holds only domestic rights. Cages Gone in Sixty Seconds director Dominic Sena keeps things moving at a bright clip but the film loses even a modicum of credibility due to a built-in conflict of interest in Bragi Schuts screenplay. His story realistically paints the medieval Catholic Church as a repository of superstition ethnic hatred torture murder and intolerance. And yet as in The Exorcist or any other movie where demons and devils put in appearances the Church is still seen as the last refuge against evil. It all depends on how one defines ""evil"" apparently if torture murder and intolerance dont make the cut. Cage and his co-star Ron Perlman play war-weary Crusaders who desert the killing fields of the Middle East to return home having tired of slaying in the Churchs name so many heretics especially when those heretics include women and children. These are two very modern dudes in fact who speak colloquial English and all but roll their eyes when Church authorities deem the Plague to be the work of a strange girl they label a ""witch."" Clearly her confession was tortured out of her and just as clearly the Plague has a biological pathology not a demonic one. And yet Schut plays it both ways as the film wants to end in a CG freak show of zombie monks flying demons and great balls of fire. Under threat of death for desertion the knights agree to transport the witch (Claire Foy) -- who in true Hollywood tradition is a beautiful witch -- to a distant abbey for her ""trial."" Her escorts include a true-believer priest (Stephen Campbell Moore) with piercing eyes; an eager youngster (Robert Sheehan) who aspires to knighthood; a knight (Ulrich Thomsen) who has lost his family to the Plague; and a con man (Stephen Graham) who should supply comic relief but never does. The initial roadblocks are standard issue -- a crumbling rope bridge to cross and a band of wolves to fend off. But increasingly the movie suggests the witchs supernatural powers are at work. The filmmakers do in the end find a way around the innocent girl/evil witch conundrum but this is emblematic of a film that wants to embrace realism and the supernatural all at once. Cage supplies energy but no depth in his portrayal of a disillusioned knight. That also goes for Perlman who never appears comfortable in the sidekick role and pretty much goes through the (exaggerated) motions. Foy has more personalities to play than Halle Berry does in Frankie and Alice. Nevertheless she is the only intriguing character in the movie especially since Moore Sheehan Thomsen and Grahams characters are all one-note constructs. The films other departments go for bombast especially with makeup (for Plague victims) and music. More holy water may actually have helped.

Both overblown and undercooked ""Season of the Witch"" is a fine example of a film that wouldve been great fun if only its creators had a sense of humor about the wild brew of absurdity they had percolating. Up until a howler of a third act this supernatural period-actioner is too inert for midnight-movie schadenfreudists and not nearly competent enough for even the most forgiving of fantasy fans. Lack of much new competition could provide a modest opening weekend but theres not enough witchcraft in the world to keep this one afloat for long. If nothing else one must applaud the moxie of the 14th century-set films historical revisionism Not only do onscreen titles place famous Crusades sieges like the Battle of Artah more than two centuries after they actually took place but director Dominic Sena may have also made the first film about medieval witch trials to side solidly with the priests who condemned peasant girls to death. A tired-looking Nicolas Cage and a game Ron Perlman star as Crusader buddies Behmen and Felson -- first seen in a lightning-fast succession of poorly CGIed Holy Land battles later to desert in disgust after Behmen accidentally kills a bystander. Quickly captured in a nearby plague-ravaged village theyre enlisted by a dying cardinal (Christopher Lee unrecognizable under pounds of prosthetic buboes) to lead a ragtag party escorting a waifish young girl (Claire Foy) suspected of dark arts to a remote monastery where her trial and exorcism will hopefully end the plague. Strange goings-on and conflicts necessarily arise along the way -- with a wolf attack showcasing some very dodgy prop work -- as the accused witch reveals herself to be quite clearly guilty as charged. Decent mileage is wrung from a nicely paced crossing over a rickety wooden bridge which adds almost nothing to the plot but actually delivers a good hit of tension. Otherwise the journey is a swollen slog leaving the film DOA until the final third with a final battle sequence that echoes ""Army of Darkness"" in everything but the wink and nudge. Anachronistic dialogue and strange accent choices are something of a given in midrange fantasy films but ""Season of the Witch"" nonetheless manages to distinguish itself in this regard. At times Perlman and Cage affect stagy Britishisms while at others they spew such phrases as ""They mustve jumped the fence"" like proper Americans; and bonafide Brit Stephen Grahams character is inexplicably given to lapse into the patois of an old-timey Brooklyn newsboy. Lensed in some beautiful locations across Austria and Hungary ""Witchs"" photography costumes and production design are of good quality; editing scoring and visual effects are most decidedly not.

By Joe Morgenstern Updated Jan. 7 2011 1201 a.m. ET A reliable distinction can be drawn between movies that arent shown at all prior to their Friday opening--studios and distributors usually know when theyve got a total disaster on their hands--and those that arent unveiled until Wednesday so that bad reviews and poisonous buzz wont destroy their first weekend at the box office. A finer distinction can be drawn between movies that are previewed on Wednesday evening (disastrousness almost guaranteed) and movies that are first screened on Wednesday afternoon (probably awful but you never know). ""Season of the Witch"" was screened in Los Angeles at 2 p.m. on Wednesday but it should have been shown around 6 or 7. ENLARGE Nicolas Cage as a Crusader with occult troubles in Season of the Witch. Relativity Media As Crusader knights during the Dark Ages Nicolas Cage (in full frown mode) and Ron Perlman (loved him as ""Hellboy"") fight computer-generated hordes lose faith in their cause and return to a Europe that has been afflicted by the plague--not the standard Black variety but an even more pestilential strain that may have been caused by witchcraft. To end the curse they must take an accused witch (shes played unbewitchingly by Claire Foy) to be exorcised in a faraway monastery. In the course of their journey they slay digital wolves and encounter popeyed suppurating corpses that help the filmmakers avoid any accusation of light-heartedness. (Though its nice for horror-film buffs that Christopher Lee does a cameo as a grotesquely disfigured cardinal on the verge of death.) The nonsense is not without its rewards. The best line belongs to an earnest priest played by Stephen Campbell Moore. In the midst of an exorcism thats lurid enough to approach certifiable looniness the priest cries ""Were going to need some more holy water"" This film should not be confused with George A. Romeros 1972 horror flick of the same name or Ingmar Bergmans ""The Seventh Seal"" in which a Crusader knight returning with his squire to plague-ravaged Sweden plays chess with Death. Mr. Cages knight ends up playing second banana to a digital devil. Welcome to the January dead zone. Country Strong Watch a clip from ""Country Strong"" starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Tim McGraw. Gwyneth Paltrow deserves better than the cliches that bedevil ""Country Strong"" which was written and directed by Shana Feste. She plays--and sings--Kelly Canter a fragile country-music legend plucked out of rehab prematurely by her greedy husband/manager James (Tim McGraw). Kellys only support in the outside world comes from Beau a sensitive guy who worked at her rehab clinic and happens to be a talented singer and guitarist. Hes played by Garrett Hedlund (most recently of ""Tron Legacy"") who is consistently likable despite his trying to be. Mr. Hedlund and Ms. Paltrow are at their intimate best in their very first scene stretched out on a bed and trying to do nothing more than work out the lyrics of a new song. The film works best when the music takes over. Its star sings well and looks lovely even when Kelly is supposed to look wasted. But the intimacy soon vanishes and the star gets crowded out of the picture from time to time by a cluttered unfocused plot that involves not just the triangle of Kelly James and Beau but a quadrangle created by the presence of Leighton Meesters Chiles an ambitious beauty queen turned up-and-coming singer in the hoary tradition of ""All About Eve."" (Ms. Meester gives an accomplished performance thats limited only by the lack of nuance in the script.) ENLARGE Gwyneth Paltrow as a singer on the rebound from addiction in Country Strong. Screen Gems ""Country Strong"" comes to spontaneous life from time to time despite maudlin devices (a wounded quail chick that Kelly carries around in a little box) and manipulative set pieces (Kelly singing to a young cancer victim is not as charming as its meant to be). More often than not though the movie observes behavior instead of revealing feelings. The most telling example occurs in a scene when Kelly struggling with her demons at every step takes the stage for her climactic concert kisses the crucifix she wears on a necklace and waits in anxious silence for the music to begin. At the instant it does the camera is back where the audience sits watching her rise in statuesque grandeur instead of on her face capturing the moment of her transformation.  Watch a clip from ""Offside"" by Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi. Movies can move audiences--and threaten governments--in ways that we Americans have either forgotten or havent known. Late last month an Iranian court sentenced two of Irans finest filmmakers Jafar Panahi and Mahmoud Rasoulof to six years in prison and banned them from making films writing scripts traveling abroad or giving interviews for 20 years. The charge was ""colluding in gatherings and making propaganda against the regime."" By lashing out against these artists the regime revealed itself to be more fearful and contemptible than its harshest critics might have contended. Fortunately the offending films can still be seen not just in the free world but in Iran where bootleg DVDs circumvent official censorship. ENLARGE Jafar Panahi in August Agence France-Presse/Getty Images When I reviewed Mr. Panahis ""The Circle"" a decade ago I wrote that ""in some parts of the world making feature films can still be a heroic enterprise."" The film (in Farsi with English subtitles and available new or used for purchase through Amazon.com) is a stunning drama about the desperate state of women in Iran. It begins with a blessed event thats immediately blighted by blind prejudice. A newborn baby certified by ultrasounds to be a boy turns out to be a girl which means the in-laws will demand a divorce. Thats shocking enough but its only a preface to fragmentary portraits of women as they had never been seen before in Iranian cinema. Watch a clip from Iranian filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof. The directors 2006 comedy ""Offside"" (Im confining these capsule descriptions to films that American movie lovers can either buy or rent on Netflix) also concerns the plight of Iranian women--those who happen to be soccer fans but who are excluded from the nations stadiums even though they may be equal to Iranian men in their passion for the sport. While the films subversions are delicate and entertaining its subjects are perfectly clear the hypocrisy of discrimination and the stupidity of authority. ENLARGE Mahmoud Rasoulof in 2009 Agence France-Presse/Getty Images ENLARGE Hossein Farzi-Zadeh in Mr. Rasoulofs Iron Island. Kino International/Everett Collection Mr. Rasoulofs ""Iron Island"" (a Netflix rental) sees the ship of state as a rotting sinking hulk. ""Titanic"" its not but this richly detailed--and improbably enjoyable--allegory is set aboard an abandoned oil tanker anchored in the Persian Gulf. The giant rust bucket serves as home--as a village really--to hundreds of people plus their goats and several donkeys. Theyve entrusted their fate to Captain Nemat (as in Nemo) a chief of state who is by turns a kindly buffoon a not-so-benevolent despot and a visionary who wants to find his followers a home on dry land. The floating village is made up mostly of Sunni Muslim Arabs a small minority in Iran so the films political content is less volatile than it may seem. Nevertheless ""Iron Island"" gives us startling images of a miniregime at odds with itself and of a community struggling like so many others to get from one day to the next. Its resources include a telephone company (i.e. a kid with a cell phone seated behind a porthole) and--subversion of subversions--a teacher who thinks his students should be taught the truth.

"Movie review Season of the Witch - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review Season of the WitchNicolas Cages singular eccentricity is missing in Season of the Witch an oddly lifeless tale set during the Crusades.January 07 2011|By Mark Olsen Special to the Los Angeles Times Ron Perlman and Nicolas Cage star in ""Season of the Witch."" (Relativity Media )It is sort of required these days when discussing Nicolas Cage to make some mention of his ever-evolving hairstyles and personal quirks a the castle and the tax problems a but there are much more immediate issues at hand regarding Cage in ""Season of the Witch."" In his latest film the actor displays only the briefest flashes of the deep commitment to chaos he brings to his best work as in his recent turns in the delightfully wacked-out ""Bad Lieutenant Port of Call New Orleans"" or even the watchable junk of ""Ghost Rider."" Set during the 14th century with the Crusades and the Black Plague as a backdrop the film tells the story of two knights (played by Cage and Ron Perlman) who desert from battle only to be redrafted into service for the purpose of transporting an accused witch (Claire Foy) to a remote monastery. Directed by the perennially hollow Dominic Sena from a script by Bragi Schut ""Season of the Witch"" is all seams. It never balances out its competing desires to be a rollicking medieval adventure a thoughtful meditation on faith and even a buddy road movie. Whats most disappointing though is how Cage seems to be sleepwalking through so much of it. He and Perlman are such odd idiosyncratic actors that they give any scene of the two of them just talking a freewheeling offhanded energy like outtakes from an unseen Hope and Crosby picture. But there are only occasional glimmers of Cages singularly eccentric line-readings or moments when he turns conventional reaction shots on their head. Mostly they crop up just enough to serve as a reminder of their absence. The cast is rounded out with wonderful European character actors such as Ulrich Thomsen and Stephen Graham even the legendary Christopher Lee but they all have little to do. ""Season of the Witch"" is at its worst when it tries to be a straight-ahead action-adventure film. The early sequence set against the epic battles of the Crusades is almost brazenly bad with its unconvincing ""300""-style special effects. A scene in which Perlman tests an aspiring young knight in a swordfight should have had a playful lighthearted feel but Sena so wildly overshoots it looking to goose up the moment that it becomes cluttered and clumsy. ""Its strange sure is strange"" goes the 60s-era Donovan song ""Season of the Witch"" a pointedly not used here a though what Senas film needs is exactly that more life more energy more strangeness.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Dominic Senas aesthetic hasnt changed much over the years but his budgets apparently have. Sena previously worked from the deep pockets of Jerry Bruckheimer (with Gone In 60 Seconds) and Joel Silver (on Swordfish and Whiteout) but Season Of The Witch with its portrait-studio-worthy backdrops and painfully obvious soundstage sequences looks like a remarkable comedown. Sena still goes for the kind of flashy effects and slick action that excited him in the past but with budget-friendly squibs instead of explosives. The film looks dispiritingly cheap and as if in response most of his cast seems half-committed at best as if theyre counting the moments until they can move on to a bigger picture. Thats especially disappointing when it comes to Nicolas Cage whose over-the-top scenery-chewing is often the high point of his lowbrow films. Apparently the scenery in Season Of The Witch looked as flavorless to him as it looks to the camera; Cage plods through the story with a stiffly restrained exaggeratedly earnest performance that makes him look like the most awkward amateur in the local Society For Creative Anachronism troupe. (Its hard to blame him when he has to mouth lines like ""I have no such yearnings for home"") He and Ron Perlman (whose easygoing take on the material is far more convincing) play 14th-century knights who desert their war band after a ridiculous many-year battle montage leads to a dispiriting massacre of women and children. Disillusioned with the Church theyre nonetheless dragooned into helping a priest transport a suspected plague-causing witch (Claire Foy) to a remote abbey. There a magical monkish book of rituals might reverse her evil magic which is supposedly turning people into grotesque piles of goo. Briefly the film plays with the question of her guilt and her true nature--is it possible shes just a scapegoat for self-righteous superstitious men? But ambiguity isnt Senas strong point and he and screenwriter Bragi Schut would rather focus on awkwardly staged action like the partys irritatingly lengthy attempt to cross a broken-down bridge over a yawning abyss. For much of the film Sena seems unsure whether hes making a CGI-assisted fantasy-horror in Van Helsing mode or a grim Middle Ages mystery a la The Name Of The Rose. The former given Cages presence might have made for some overripe entertainment but would have required more money. Unfortunately the films preposterously self-important yet faintly cheesy tone cant support the latter. Season Of The Witch was originally scheduled for a March 2010 release before being delayed and dumped in the January graveyard but it probably shouldnt have been released at all. No use throwing good money after bad even if there wasnt much invested to begin with.

"Season of the Witch Is it Satans work or just hellishly awful? | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesSeason of the Witch Is it Satans work or just hellishly awful?There are three cases of demonic possession in Season of the Witch but only two that we need care about.Renegade knight Nicolas Cage in a bad wig gets torchy in Season of the Witch.  (EGON ENDRENYI / AP PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Jan. 6 2011 Season of the Witch (out of 4) Starring Nicholas Cage Ron Perlman Claire Foy and Stephen Campbell Moore. Directed by Dominic Sena. At major theatres. 92 minutes. 14A There are three cases of demonic possession in Season of the Witch but only two we need care about. I refer to actor Nicolas Cage and director Dominic Sena last united 11 years ago for Gone In 60 Seconds a heist flick remake that had the good sense to remain stupid. Cage back then was also doing fun knuckle-draggers like Con Air and Sena was not long off the juicy pulp of Kalifornia. Both had a knack for elevating trash; now they just shovel it. But is it really their fault or Satans? Im convinced the glazed face of Cages renegade knight Behmen in Season of the Witch is due not to pressure from his ridiculous hairpiece which resembles misplaced seaweed but rather to devilish doings. Likewise for Sena whose undeniable flair for genre fare (Swordfish being another) has devolved into the worst kind of CGI-stoked hackery obviously the work of Ol Nick himself. Or maybe not on second thought. Did either Cage or Sena even bother reading Bragi F. Schuts patchwork script before adjusting the wig flicking on the camera and cashing the pay cheques? Consider the evidence. Its the 14th Century. Crusader knights Behmen and Felson (Ron Perlman) are busily killing multitudes in the name of God and also to see who will pay the nightly bar tab. They do one massacre too many -- women and children are involved -- and decide that perhaps God isnt into genocide as much as theyd supposed. They split from the Crusades only to run into the Black Plague the highly disfiguring and deadly disease scourging Europe. There is widespread ignorance of the benefits of soap and clean water yet everyone curiously benefits from an excellent dental plan. Behmen and Felson want only to hit the saloons but they are ordered by a plague-infested cardinal (a completely unrecognizable Christopher Lee) to do the proverbial one last job. They must escort a caged witch (Claire Foy) some 400 leagues away (you Google it Im tired) to a castle where monks will chant an incantation from a magical book that will de-bitch the witch or something like that. Oh and it will also cure the plague or so they think. Why doesnt the witch just go there on her broomstick you ask? Because she might fly off the handle ba-da-bump-bump. But I digress. For baffling reasons Behmen and Felson are travelling with a pervy priest (Stephen Campbell Moore) a grieving father (Ulrich Thomsen) a useless guide (Stephen Graham) and a snotty young knight wannabe (Robert Sheehan). That young snot-noses name is Kay by the way and I waited in vain for someone to yell ""Oh Kay"" But I digress again. The excess of characters is a puzzle but the biggest noggin-scratcher of them all is the relationship between Cages Behmen and Perlmans Felson. Cage thinks hes making a sequel to Lord of the Rings one where the hobbit kind of gets the girl rather than the other hobbit. He stares at The Witch (who actually cleans up quite nicely) wondering whether to shoot her with his crossbow or ask her out to dinner. Perlman meanwhile believes he signed on for Son of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Both are sadly mistaken. The dissonance between the two is felt most keenly in Perlmans constant wise-quackery even in the face of such horrors as rabid wolves screaming harpies faulty bridges and the non-invention of deodorant. You can almost hear the ""dude"" at the end of such Perlman pearls as these ""Whoever slays the most men drinks for free"" But what of that third case of demonic possession which sharp-eyed readers will recall from the top of this review? That would be telling not that spoilers matter in something this dopey. Suffice to say that whod have thunk that Satan was a bibliophile? Furthermore all concerned missed a chance at black comedy by choosing the wrong book to idolize and slay demons for. By all thats holy it should have been Keith Richards autobiography dude.

Disillusioned defected knights Behmen and Felson (Nicolas Cage and Ron Perlman) retreat home across a hotchpotch Europe and turn off into a Hammer film. Arriving at a plague-eaten town our heroes are conscripted into a party charged with transporting an accused witch across perilous terrain to a cathedral town where her trial supposedly will lift the pox from the land. Hackneyed scenes -- the thousandth iteration of fantasy-adventure fan favorite moments like crossing a rotted-through rope bridge or crying in midbattle ""The head Cut off the head"" -- are performed with a ceremonious straight face as is awful ""camaraderie"" banter between Cage and Perlman (""The ale is on you tonight""). At points along the dark journey director Dominic Senas treatment seems bracing because its so basic; at other times thats merely autopilot melees done in uniform quick-cut action montages cycling through gouging and hacking members of the merry band. The makeup departments glommed-on plague pustules are fantastic but the concession to modern technology in a badly rendered last-act CGI demon cut and pasted from a Diablo II screen-grab is so eminently lame as to cure all fear of hellfire.

If the answers no stop reading now. If its yes youre in for the first guilty treat of 2011.Perlman and Nicolas Cage (in curly blond pageboy frightwig natch) play rambunctious Crusader knights who go Awol and find themselves in a non-specific plague-stricken East European principality. The Catholic authorities claim that said epidemic is the work of a captive witch (Claire Foy) and waste no time hiring Nic and Ron to chaperone the prisoner through mountain country to have her soul cleansed at a monastery.No one least of all Cage or director Dominic Sena makes any bid for greatness despite its admirably straight face Season of the Witch is a silly romp through Pythonesque medieval cliche and knockabout Hammer horror with a dash of cut-price Tolkien chucked in to keep things moving. Cage barks emotes and swears inappropriately ably backed by Perlman as his burly sidekick and the cast is padded out with the likes of Christopher Lee as a devious hideously scarred cardinal.Season of the Witch is not for everyone its creaky predictable and frequently idiotic. But for a tipsy Saturday night this should tick all the right boxes.

I on purpose didn`t review or check the box blurb since that gives away the entire plot all by itself. This film is best if you just pick it up because the Medieval-Witch picture on the front is your theme interest. The early scenes showing how many battles they`ve thought was a nice idea. I also liked the ambiguity where a lot of people watching the film would`ve just assumed it was superstitious medieval nonsense but it wasn`t. The girl didn`t turn out to be the hapless innocent after all. the ending was a bit bit weak since the best part was wondering what was the truth of it and they seemed to run out of anything really clever to do at the end. Ron was great but Cage while ok didn`t really do as much as I feel he could`ve. I think it was a good film not terrible at all.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 14 2011sorrrowfulFeaturednot as bad as some say but not as good either. Empty your head fill a wine glass or three and sit back and be mildly entertained.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 8 2011iLovefilmsFeaturedMost people would call ""Season Of The Witch"" an awful movie. But if like me you enjoy having an easy watch every now amp; then inbetween your more thoughtful films then this does the job. By no means as well acted or entertaining as the similar ""Black Death"" or ""Solomon Kane"" but as a piece of medieval trashy entertainment it works Ron Perlman is strong as always amp; Nic Cage (Talking in a full American accent) is his usual self... A good little action flick with swords amp; witches so if your into this type of film then watch it amp; judge for yourself. I did see this in the cinema amp; had a good time watching it; although I felt certain parts could have been better especially the ending I also just picked this up on Blu Ray amp; most people who are intrigued by the front cover should be more than happy with a cheap purchase or a blind buy.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 14 2011edFeaturedCertainly not as woeful as Ghost Rider Bangkok Dangerous or The Wicker Man Remake...but this is stil below par after Nicolas Cages partial return to good films last year in Bad Lieutenant 2 Kick Ass and Sorcerers Apprentice. Id file this along with Knowing and Drive Angry 3D as kind of in the middle there. There is a fairly scary intro to this film but from there on in there are no scares. Fans of Ron Perlman who is always in this kind of movie wont be disappointed. Yes he does headbutt the Devil... I havent seen such a sorry Euro cast since Prince Valiant or Dungeons amp; Dragons... A hopeless quest with ropey morals and even crappier sfx. Nicolas Cage is fairly subdued for once but maybe he was just resting because he has to be the busiest actor around... Role on Ghost Rider 2... Arggghhhh I hear thats got Christopher Lambert in it not long before youre DTV Nic...FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 16 2011perplexed filmgoerFeaturedI quite enjoyed this film - up until about fifteen or twenty minutes from the end when it got pretty stupid and lost the plot literally. It really seemed like someone just decided to change the story at the last minute - maybe Im wrong about this but thats just how it came across. Im sure anyone could have come up with a better ending. But theres a lot to like about the film too - I liked the daft dialogue the relationship between the two leads the medieval setting the ambiguity about some of the other characters... its just a shame it went pear-shaped Oh and why did everyone have an American accent - even the non-Americans? WeirdFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 10 2011scrumpyjackFeaturedSpot on review - I enjoyed it and dont care who knows but can I just point out its not 113 min but just under 100. 7/10FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 9 2011CuriousFeaturedI have now seen the movie and I think the review is pretty fair. Its not the worst movie Ive ever seen and it even provides some thrills and chills at the end. But I was curious because I thought there might be some interesting story about the way characters interact--and there really isnt. Its pretty predictable. I dont want to offer any spoilers but I went hoping to be wowed -- as one always hopes with a good story -- and this was not. But probably like me youll have to see it for yourself to understand why its a kinda stupid flat movie.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/89385/season-of-the-witch.html,200,seasonofthewitch24,seasonofthewitch,timeout
