Virtuoso Aussie helmer Baz Luhrmann displays resourcefulness as he mixes film and song styles to relate a tale of <i>la vie boheme</i>. ""Moulin Rouge"" is a tour de force of artifice a dazzling pastiche of musical and visual elements at the service of a blatantly artificial story. Virtuoso Aussie helmer Baz Luhrmann displays often amazing resourcefulness as he mixes a multitude of film and song styles to relate a quintessential tale of la vie boheme but the fact that he is dealing broadly with archetypes and conventions restricts the pictures effectiveness to its brilliant surface. Beginning its giant promo push with the opening-night slot at the Cannes Film Festival 20th Century Fox will get plenty of publicity mileage out of the exploitable musical and fashion elements as well as stars Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor and many buffs and musical fans will respond positively. But pics ability to go the distance at the B.O. will rest largely on whether young viewers in the 15- to 30-year-old range will engage with the story and Luhrmanns showbizzy treatment of familiar rock tunes Its questionable. Strictly in terms of musical razzle-dazzle Luhrmann outstrips anything Hollywood has produced in years and now bears comparison to the likes of Busby Berkeley in his ability to conceptualize and physically energize production numbers. Drawing for inspiration on sources as diverse as pioneer silent-film fantasist Georges Melies and rap-era music sampling the director surpasses his previous features ""Strictly Ballroom"" and ""William Shakespeares Romeo+Juliet"" even if the new work almost certainly will prove less congenial to general audiences. Luhrmann applies his feverish imagination even to the presentation of the opening logo as the widescreen is filled by a red curtain that is gradually drawn back to reveal the Fox trademark to the accompaniment of an onscreen conductor leading the familiar fanfare. An extraordinary succession of shots in which models and effects combine to magnificently evoke the poetic realism of studio-fabricated silent cinema transports the viewer back to Paris 1900 where melancholy young scribe Christian (McGregor) is tearfully writing (and narrating) the story of his doomed love affair with Satine (Kidman) the late star of the Moulin Rouge and Montmartres most beautiful courtesan. In a breathtaking swirl of movement and color the heady voluptuous delirious world of Paris celebrated nightclub/dance hall is brought to vibrant life. Like everything else in the picture the Moulin Rouge here is a reinterpretation of the real thing designed with an eye to giving it contemporary relevance; the men might be dressed in black tie and top hat but the music slips breathlessly from ""Diamonds Are a Girls Best Friend"" to ""Material Girl"" as Satine descends spectacularly from the ceiling via trapeze and picks Christian out of the crowd to dance. With the finagling of pal Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo) Christian ends up in Satines boudoir (a fabulous stand-alone apartment conceived as a bejeweled Indian-style elephant one of many magnificent creations by production designer/co-costume designer Catherine Martin). With the star mistakenly believing Christian is the ""Duke"" an endlessly wealthy man Satine is supposed to bed so that Moulin Rouge owner Zidler (Jim Broadbent) can secure financing to turn the venue into a legitimate theater Satine is compliant with the eager and earnest young writer. To the amusingly effective strains of Elton John and Bernie Taupins ""Your Song"" the beautiful young bohemians fall in love and act one comes to a rousing close with Christians belief (via the Beatles) that ""All You Need Is Love"" in overcoming Satines pragmatic denigration of ""Silly Love Songs."" The lovers bliss could scarcely be more fleeting however. In exchange for his funding the Duke (Richard Roxburgh) demands of Zidler not only the deed to the Moulin Rouge but exclusive ""rights"" to Satine. Worse though is the fact that Satine is dying of that classic 19th-century disease consumption. Prone to fainting spells and coughing up blood she spends every possible moment with Christian avoiding her command performances with the increasingly agitated Duke while helping Christian along with Toulouse-Lautrec and his comic-relief cohorts to write the opening attraction for the new theater an epic musical that neatly reflects the ongoing melodrama of the Christian-Satine-Duke triangle. With the Dukes unrequited obsession and incensed jealousy having passed the boiling point everything comes together on opening night as theatrical and ""real"" life converge and play out onstage in full public view. Although the drama necessarily becomes darker and more threatening in the second hour Luhrmanns wit remains in strong supply. A high point is reached when Zidler launches into an outlandish rendition of Madonnas ""Like a Virgin"" in an attempt to convince the anxious Duke that the absent Satine is busy ""purifying"" herself. Also inspired is a tango version of Stings ""Roxanne"" that dramatizes the perils of falling in love with a prostitute. For all the effectiveness of the storytelling which despite its musical and visual flamboyance is nicely balanced overall between song-driven narrative and dramatic scenes the love story never truly takes on a life of its own that rouses viewer emotion and becomes moving in its own right. Tale is so clearly a synthetic recycling of ""La Boheme"" elements that the characters remain constructs exaggerated caricatures that are vibrant yet bloodless. By the time the predestined end arrives the fact that Luhrmanns accomplishment is one of style rather than of substance has become perilously clear. This is not at all the fault of the performers who throw themselves into their roles with abandon and deliver with enthusiasm to burn. With her alabaster-and-flame look amplified by a scar of red lipstick and dazzling costumes Kidmans Satine evokes screen goddesses from Dietrich to Garbo to Monroe and the actresss own iconic status is exalted in the process. McGregor is the real surprise however as he energetically bares more honest emotion than he ever has onscreen and reveals an outstanding voice (all thesps did their own live singing). Broadbent impressively breaks through the cartoon-like constraints of his makeup and garb to offer a quasi-human impresario while others including Roxburgh as the Duke and Leguizamo as Toulouse-Lautrec (whose painterly endeavors are ignored) work strictly in the realm of caricature to greater and lesser effect. Shot entirely in-studio mostly in Australia but with some pickup work done in Madrid the production represents an assembly of a staggering number of details particularly in the design and musical departments. Its difficult to imagine the amount of work that went into the creation of the soundtrack which is based mostly on elements from pop standards rather than more esoteric or edgy works while Martins efforts on the production design and -- with Angus Strathie -- on the costumes cannot be overpraised. Donald M. McAlpines lustrous lensing maximizes these contributions while repeatedly finding the most striking angles from which to photograph the stars and both he and the f/x crew have gone beyond the usual smooth CGI look of most modern films by combining elements in a satisfyingly rough hand-hewn manner.

"The Disrespected Arts Journalist Blues | | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Culture Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Observer Music The Disrespected Arts Journalist Blues By Justin Joffe  07/29/16 324pm Patron saint of schlubby music journalists Lester Bangs. More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Studio bosses blithely green-light teen comedies gross enough to bring a blush to the ghost of Lenny Bruce yet they shudder at mounting a musical. Apparently thats the last dirty word you cant say in Hollywood. What went wrong? Time was when American movies couldnt stop singing. In the 30s perhaps a third of all films were in some way musicals. Top Broadway composers went West and wrote tunes that were the most popular of their day and still play in the nations memory-jukebox; Harold Arlens score for The Wizard of Oz is entrancing TV audiences 60 years after it was written. Pop music shared center stage with operetta (in Jeanette MacDonalds films) and boogie-woogie (in shorts showcasing such jazz greats as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington). In the fantasy language of film it was the most natural thing for a fella and a gal to burst into song. Just about everybody sang Cagney Gable the Marx Brothers every cowboy from Gene Autry to John Wayne. And when the stars didnt sing they danced. Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers not only taught the nation new steps but dancing cheek to cheek they put love in motion. They defined la belle la perfectly swell romance. Even the assault of rock n roll which divided pop music into kid stuff and easy listening didnt put an end to musicals. A Hard Days Night peacefully coexisted with The Sound of Music (which was one of four 60s musicals to win the Oscar for Best Picture and which reigned for 12 years as the worlds top-grossing film). But the form soon atrophied. The last traditional live-action musical to be a box-office smash was Grease in 1978. Since then only animated features like Beauty and the Beast have put fannies in the seats and songs on the Top 40. And lately even the cartoons are doing without a lot of new songs. Today the notion of people opening their mouths to sing their hearts out is as anachronistic as speaking in iambic pentameter. If anyone can bring pizazz to this decrepit genre its Baz Luhrmann--the mad Aussie who in his 1996 Romeo + Juliet made Shakespeare play like a psychedelic rap video. The idea here was to take a plot that crosses 42nd Street with Camille and he says ""steal bits of culture from the 20th century and use it to make a code a software to access emotion and character."" The movies first moments (a skinhead in a tux conducts the Fox fanfare) cue you to Luhrmanns boldness. A Green Fairy sings The Sound of Music. In the nightclub Nicole Kidman evokes Marilyn and Madonna as she swings above the crowd warbling Diamonds Are a Girls Best Friend. Ewan McGregor as the poor writer who falls for the courtesan is a nouveau Gene Kelly--a hunky Joe with a radiant smile haunting the Left Bank like An American in Paris twirling an umbrella a la Singin in the Rain. Theres something else deja vu about this pair they have the innocence and maturity of the great old stars. Moulin Rouge isnt just a retro wallow. Its a head-on collision of the romantic and the grotesque the songs of MGM and MTV. Dwarves in spangled costumes dance to Rhythm of the Night; a sultry chorus line coos ""Moulin Rouge-ez avec moi ce soir?"" and performs a tantric cancan. Like The Producers this is a backstage musical with a delirious production number. Here its an all-out far-out tribute to Indias Bollywood musicals--a kind of Springtime for Hindu--with enough eye candy to give the viewer diabetes. Luhrmann will never be guilty of visual understatement (his name could be Luridman) but he and his wife production designer and costumer Catherine Martin have found an intelligent nexus of sense and sensibility. They have created a fantasy Paris where everything is not only possible but gorgeous as well. The camera hovers over a cityscape that looks like a perfect cardboard diorama. Dancers skirts swirl in Impressionist pixilation. ""Dont wanna listen?"" the film seems to ask the musically challenged viewer. ""Then just watch"" Theres a final reason the movie musical is dormant. The form is about transcending speech with song allowing the soul to soar; and rapture is out of fashion in pop culture. With its image of lovers perched on a cloud under a smiling moon Moulin Rouge can rekindle that joy. The film dances; the heart sings.

(20th Century Fox) When youre thinking ""musical stars"" chances are Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman arent the first two actors that loom large in the brain. But in Baz Luhrmanns ""Moulin Rouge"" theyre easy heck even charming on the ear.They continue the growing tradition of musicals (such as ""Everyone Says I Love You"") in which people sing in their own unapologetic voices rather than with false Broadway brassiness. Of course neither performer would be wise to pursue a professional singing career after this but they acquit themselves wonderfully.Theyre more than carried along anyway by Luhrmanns postmodern bohemian rhapsody of a musical. Its a brilliant tribute to many things Pariss bohemian era the evolution of pop music from Gilbert amp; Sullivan to Nirvana and musicals from ""Gold Diggers of 1933"" to Lars von Triers ""Dancer in the Dark.""McGregor plays Christian the archetypal penniless writer come to Gay Paree circa 1899. Kidman - conspicuously cast against prim type - is Satine the Moulins biggest attraction and a successful courtesan. Satine gets her shot at the big time (she wants to be a classy actress a la Sarah Bernhardt) when club owner Zidler (Jim Broadbent) offers her services to a repressed psychologically twisted financier the Duke of Worcester (Richard Roxburgh). In turn he agrees to finance Moulins latest ambitious show.Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo) a club regular and social observer helps Christian get a job writing songs for the show. He pleases everyone with his first idea a song that begins with ""The hills are alive with the sound of music.""Christian falls in love with Satine who mistakenly thinks hes the Duke. By the time the Duke rears his ugly head Satines already in love with Christian. While Satine rehearses for the show and keeps the Duke at bay she meets surreptitiously with Christian.Things are obviously going to get stickier.McGregors appealing as always. Hes a great sport of an actor whos always game for a new challenge. He makes a truly sweet-natured character. Kidmans cool screen presence warms up considerably. Shell never be hot to the touch but shes likable enough here.But the great star of course is behind the red curtain. Thats Luhrmann who also made the inspired ""Strictly Ballroom"" and ""Romeo + Juliet."" Working with music director Marius DeVries and many of his regular collaborators (including cinematographer Donald M. McAlpine and production manager/costume designer Catherine Martin) he has created a wonderful cutting-edge opera.He nods at cinema itself with glimpses of silent movie irising techniques a beaming man-in-the-moon (straight out of the turn-of-the-century films of Georges Melies) and salutations to great screen divas from Dietrich to Minnelli. Musically you can hear strains of almost everything as the colorful bohos at the Moulin sing dance and vamp. Theres a cafe waltz based on Marc Bolans ""Children of the Revolution."" Another song segues from Jule Styne and Leo Rubins ""Diamonds Are a Girls Best Friend"" to Madonnas ""Material Girl."" And heres my personal showstopper ""El Tango de Roxanne"" a darkly voiced rendition of Stings ethereal pop song replete with tango dancers and a scheme that might be called ""sepulchral gloom and doom.""Its a wonderful postmodern hug of a movie and never once do you not know youre watching a movie. But thats the point Not to lose yourself in the movie but to be brightly aware of your participation as a viewer. In Luhrmanns vision thats what the movies are about.""Moulin Rouge"" (PG-13 125 minutes) - Contains sexual shenanigans some violence and absinthe drinking.

(20th Century Fox) Baz Luhrmanns ""Moulin Rouge"" is a magnificent mess of a postmodern musical spinning like the windmill atop the notorious nightspot swirling like the petticoats of the cancan girls swaggering like the swells in top hats and tails. Images explode from the screen like corks from champagne bottles working girls flirt with Jeans and the dance halls are alive with the sound of music. You want innovation look no further than this exercise in pop rock with its kitsch choreography stunning camerawork and spastic editing. You want beef with your bearnaise forget about it.Like ""Dancer in the Dark"" ""The Knights Tale"" and his own version of ""Romeo and Juliet"" Luhrmanns latest is part of the New Rave. Music breaks the time barrier between present and past. The director also recycles songs and dance routines from classic movie musicals the best of old Broadway and the bump and thrum of MTV. Whenever wherever its all about shaking your booty. Set in Montmartre in 1899 the story is a star-crossed romance reminiscent of ""La Boheme"" that centers on Christian (Ewan McGregor) a struggling young writer new to the bohemian Paris neighborhood. The welcome wagon arrives when a portly thespian falls through the ceiling of his cheap transient hotel. With the help of Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo) the unfortunate actor and his flaky colleagues are working on a new show for the Moulin Rouge. But theyre not getting anywhere without a writer.Its as if the gods themselves had a hand in the fortuitous catastrophe which leads to the naive Christians love affair with Satine (Nicole Kidman) the nightclubs headliner and the citys top courtesan. Satine will star in ""Spectacular Spectacular"" the splashy revue to be bankrolled by the smitten Duke of Worcester (Richard Roxburgh) in exchange for exclusive access to Satines boudoir.The unknowingly consumptive Satine who was rescued from a whores life on the streets by Zidler (Jim Broadbent) the clubs lubricious impresario initially resists Christians suit. Though torn between her purse and heartstrings Satine must also consider her colleagues welfare lest the mustache-stroking duke close the show and foreclose on Zidlers property.But the duke a gullible fop is no competition for the idealistic and persistent Christian. In the end Satine risks everything for her true love. And as Christian assures her in a romantic rooftop medley ""All you need is love . . . love is all you need.""Such scenes have their charms. However if you want tension or coherence with your tunes go see ""West Side Story"" a legitimate marriage of book and lyrics. What you have here is a narrative often awkwardly contorted to suit the songs. Take Satines excuse for not putting off the duke She wants to feel ""Like a Virgin."" At first the duke doubts the courtesan but then hes turned around by the casts ripping rendition of the Madonna hit. With the exceptions of the endearing magical duets between Christian and Satine Luhrmanns lyrical narrative is a veritable cacophony of showstoppers. It seems hes never heard the term ""dramatic silence."" Amid the ruckus the lovers interludes are all the more appreciated even though Kidman and McGregor wont be mistaken for Judy Garland and Frank Sinatra anytime soon. The leads do have pleasant voices but they are neither powerful nor distinctive. This is especially a problem for Kidman who makes her big entrance to ""Diamonds Are a Girls Best Friend."" Its a competent performance but diamonds arent just any girls best friend. Marilyn Monroe owns that number and it is never ever going to look better on anybody else - certainly not the lean cool Kidman. The leading lady seems to have modeled Satine on Marlene Dietrich sans the sexuality danger and cigarette smoke. Theres no denying her beauty or chutzpah but unfortunately she lacks both mystery and vulnerability - must-haves for any aspiring male-magnet.Luckily McGregor the movies most engaging performer is convincing enough to sell the mutual attraction. The ""Trainspotting"" star is usually playing some kind of freak and this is a nice stretch for him. In any case the appealing duo are all but upstaged by the grotesque caricatures of the supporting cast - particularly Leguizamos Donald Duck of a Lautrec Zidlers garishly rouged nightmare of an emcee and a rash of whorish unattractive and mean-spirited chorines. Lets not even get into the matter of the black cross-dresser named Chocolat. Or the fact that ""Moulin Rouge"" isnt about anything much less the contemplation of the bohemians professed contemplation of truth beauty and love. Whatever. As Zidler puts it to the brokenhearted Satine ""The show must go on."" And so it does - this ones got everything but Siegfried and Roy.""Moulin Rouge"" (118 minutes) is rated PG-13 for raunch.

Satine (Kidman) and Christian (Ewan McGregor) fall in love in the film set in 1899 Paris but scored with familiar pop tunes. Red hot / Moulin Rouge reinvents musical genre with audacious rapid-fire assault on the senses 1 / 2 Back to Gallery MOULIN ROUGE Musical. Starring Nicole Kidman Ewan McGregor John Leguizamo and Jim Broadbent. Directed by Baz Luhrmann. Written by Luhrmann and Craig Pearce. (PG-13. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Imagine two hours of cranked-up movie trailers The volume is punishing the pacing relentlessly fast and the gestures broad and obvious. Everything is punched up overstressed. Thats how it feels to sit through Baz Luhrmanns ""Moulin Rouge"" a movie so cheeky aggressive and bursting with vitality that it cant help being annoying and exhilarating at the same time. A lavish 53 million romance starring Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor ""Moulin Rouge"" is Luhrmanns bid to revitalize the movie musical -- to make it hip and contemporary and appealing to a youth audience that views musicals as creaky antiquities. He reinvents the genre all right and brings to it a fierce operatic passion -- but the result isnt exactly fresh. Rather its a kitschy pastiche of winking anachronisms and movie references overproduced power ballads and MTV editing cartoonish overstatement and shameless swipes from other movies. Luhrmann the Australian director of ""Strictly Ballroom"" and ""William Shakespeares Romeo + Juliet"" gives us spew -- the kind that Ken Russell would have provided if hed had this kind of budget. Some of the spew is gorgeous and some is absolute ecstatic movie magic but its spew nonetheless. It never stops. Pity the dancers and choreographers who toiled on the film The editing is so rapid-fire -- most images hold for less than a second -- that we cant even see their work. ""Moulin Rouge"" is set in the decadent underworld of 1899 Paris where the young poet Christian (McGregor) arrives in Montmartre in the midst of a ""bohemian revolution"" and falls for the gorgeous Satine (Kidman) a courtesan and lead chorine at the Moulin Rouge. Satine promises her boss Zidler (Jim Broadbent) that shell sleep with the unctuous Duke (Richard Roxburgh) in exchange for a fat financial gift to the Moulin Rouge. Instead she falls for Christian and gets him hired as the writer of a stage extravaganza that will prove her mettle as an actress. Oh right Shes also dying a fact that Luhrmann lifting from the myth of Orpheus reveals in her first scene. This is a movie to both love and hate. The picture opens with a brilliant touch An orchestra conductor stands before a theatrical curtain that opens to the 20th Century Fox logo and music theme. Next were in a sepia-toned Paris with the camera swooping over a diorama of rooftops to the Moulin Rouge where a painted harlequin sings a mournful version of Nat ""King"" Coles ""Nature Boy "" about a ""strange enchanted boy."" Bam The next hour is a riot of color-saturated images commedia dellarte- paced comedy and musical set pieces scored with overfamiliar pop tunes. Cancan girls perform to ""Lady Marmalade"" Kidman descends from the rafters on a trapeze and vamps ""Diamonds Are a Girls Best Friend"" and ""Material Girl."" Broadbent camps his way through ""Like a Virgin"" and McGregor dons lederhosen and warbles ""The hills are alive with the sound of music . . ."" Nearly everything in the movie is appropriated from somewhere else. Professing their love Kidman (her singing voice is high and thin) and McGregor (his is much better) launch into a medley of tunes thats obvious and redundant ""All You Need Is Love"" ""I Will Always Love You"" ""Silly Love Songs "" ""Up Where We Belong."" Even the dialogue is taken from song lyrics -- tacky. Its awfully silly but Luhrmann is so daring -- ditto his wife production and costume designer Catherine Martin -- that they manage to hit the occasional bulls-eye. As McGregor launches into Elton Johns ""Your Song"" his rising ardor turns kinetic and he and Kidman are transported to a dipped-in- indigo firmament. The moon smiles down the stars glitter and the lovers dance on a platform of fleecy clouds. Believe me it works. It works largely because McGregor a fantastic actor and dynamic musical performer (he was the best thing in ""Velvet Goldmine"") has the talent to make us believe the operatic emotions that pour out of him. Unlike Broadbent and John Leguizamo who plays a lisping irritating Toulouse-Lautrec McGregor never condescends to this florid overcooked material. He never gets cute. As much as I dislike the assaultiveness of Luhrmanns film the banality of the musical conceits and the ironic detachment that he relies upon (does movie emotion always have to be filtered through irony?) I cant dismiss ""Moulin Rouge."" This is the work of a true romantic full of crazy passion and insane energy. Luhrmann may even be a visionary -- assuming that visionaries are just as prone to vulgarity as they are to transcendent beauty. Advisory This movie contains sexual situations and adult themes.

The film is almost a living organism as it swirls swoops soars and sweeps across the screen in a kaleidoscope of color and movement all framed in an operatic setting of sight and sound. It doesnt always work -- and at times things get too frantic and the editing becomes too fragmented -- but as a whole this ambitious project flies off the screen. The director Australian wunderkind Baz Luhrmann is a visceral artist of the highest order. ""Moulin Rouge"" is the third of his so-called ""Red Curtain"" movies -- films that are highly theatrical with a reinterpretation of a familiar setting -- following ""Strictly Ballroom"" (1993) an allegorical look at the world of ballroom dance competition; and ""William Shakespeares Romeo + Juliet"" (1996) an MTV-style version of the classic love story set in present-day Miami Beach complete with warring gangs wielding automatic weapons. VIDEO CNNs Paul Clinton calls Moulin Rouge a monumental artistic achievement that swirls and swoops across the screen (May 31) Play video (QuickTime Real or Windows Media) Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor star in Moulin Rouge (May 21) Play video (QuickTime Real or Windows Media) Now with ""Moulin Rouge"" Luhrmann has taken one of the 19th centurys most infamous and decadent nightclubs added a musical score featuring wildly reconfigured songs from throughout the 20th century and thrown in a tragic love story. What emerges is a dazzling electrifying event that transcends the screen. ""Moulin Rouge"" is a cinematic joyride that engages your eyes more than your heart but its one hell of a ride. Musicals within musicals Luhrmann surrounds himself with the same creative team for all of his projects. His wife production and costume designer Catherine Martin is intrinsic to his visual style. Donald McAlpine is his long-time director of photography and Jill Bilcock is his editor. His co-writer Craig Pearce also has a longstanding relationship with the Filmmaker. The two have loosely based this films story on the myth of Orpheus in which a young poet descends into the underworld in search of ideal love. You can also throw in a little ""Camille"" (1937) and a smidgen of ""42nd Street"" (1933) into the pot.

"Moulin Rouge | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; moulin-rouge ) Moulin Rouge (United States/Australia 2001) A movie review by James Berardinelli Baz Luhrmanns Moulin Rouge is a rigorously accurate historical account of events that occurred during the period between 1899 and 1900 in Paris infamous Moulin Rouge nightclub. Luhrmanns meticulously researched motion picture uncovers several shocking truths previously unknown to historians - for example it seems that musical luminaries like Elton John and Paul McCartney are guilty of plagiarism - songs credited to them were originally penned by a little-known songwriter named Christian and performed at the Moulin Rouge. Well not quite... Actually what Luhrmann has done here is to take an historical locale (the Moulin Rouge did exist around the turn of the last century in the heart of Monmartre) and a few real people and drop them into an entirely fictional production that uses pop hits (primarily from the 70s and 80s) to populate the soundtrack. In keeping with a recent motion picture trend that anarchonistically applies modern music to period pieces Moulin Rouge ventures down the same trail explored by the likes of Kenneth Branaghs Loves Labours Lost and the woefully inept A Knights Tale. In a move that echoes Branaghs Lurhmann deflects likely criticism by transforming his version of 1900 Paris into something out of a hallucinogenic fairy tale. This is not in any sense a ""real"" version of the City of Lights nor is it a factual representation of the Moulin Rouge. Its a fantasy and because of this the presence of songs like ""The Sound of Music"" ""Your Song"" and ""Roxanne"" dont seem out of place. In fact they work surprisingly well in this context. There are also some creative touches applied to familiar tunes. Lurhmann fuses ""Diamonds Are a Girls Best Friend"" with ""Material Girl"" and develops a ""Love Montage"" featuring about a half-dozen love songs. And you havent lived until youve heard British thespian Jim Broadbent croon ""Like a Virgin."" (That alone is worth the price of admission...) Since Moulin Rouge is the product of Australian director Luhrmann its chief trait is style - thats with a capital S-T-Y-L-E. Viewers are likely either to love or hate the movies excesses much as was the case with Luhrmanns oft-discussed 1996 production Romeo + Juliet (the one starring a pre-Titanic Leonardo DiCaprio and a pre-Mod Squad Claire Danes). Luhrmann also helmed the 1992 comedy/romance Strictly Ballroom which charmed art-house audiences during its American run. Moulin Rouge subjects its viewers to a sensory overload with gaudy gloriously overproduced musical numbers that pay homage to the greats of the past while simultaneously outdoing them. When Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman are dancing on the clouds theyre doing so with digitally-created stardust falling all around them. Splashed with garish colors that span the spectrum Moulin Rouge is bright brash and wildly entertaining. It modernizes the musical in a way that may give younger movie-lovers a sense of why this genre was once so popular. The production numbers are presented with so much energy and gusto that its impossible not to be sucked in - and also impossible not to feel a moments letdown on each occasion when one is over and its time to get back to moving the paper-thin narrative forward. The films protagonist and narrator is Christian (Ewan McGregor who keeps his clothes on throughout - much to the chagrin of female viewers) a penniless writer who hooks up with a group of bohemians putting together a play to be performed at the Moulin Rouge. His goal ""to write about truth beauty freedom and love."" When the groups leader the dwarf Toulouse Lautrec (John Leguizamo) likes Christians work he decides to get him a one-on-one interview with the star of the Moulin Rouges racy revue the courtesan Satine (Nicole Kidman who keeps her clothes on throughout - much to the chagrin of male viewers). He is immediately smitten and to her surprise so is she. But she is also being pursued by a wealthy duke (Richard Roxburgh) whose investment in the Moulin Rouge will make the clubs owner Zidler (Jim Broadbent who keeps his clothes on throughout - much to the relief of all viewers) a wealthy man. And theres another factor - Satine is afflicted with tuberculosis (her fate is revealed in the films first scene but I wont give it away here). Despite all of the bombastic musical numbers or perhaps because of them the love story in Moulin Rouge works. At times its even touching. Some of this has to do with the actors. Ewan McGregor plays his role with a puppydog likability and naA-ve romanticism. Nicole Kidman positively smolders - its a shame that her on-screen work here is likely to be overshadowed by her off-screen problems. One could make a compelling case that this is the best performance of her career. The love songs which form the bulk of their interaction serve to enhance the sense of romance and it helps that neither of the stars is being dubbed. Their voices are strong and clear (although occasionally drowned out by the instruments). Historical purists and those who enjoy only sedate films are likely to be infuriated by what Luhrmann has done here but who cares? We live in an age of excess and Lurhmann takes it to the hilt. Theres no area in which he holds back. With a widescreen picture more edits than any film since Requiem for a Dream and a soundtrack that demands digital playback Luhrmann has fashioned the template for a new kind of musical. This is as much a summer film as The Mummy Returns but with one important difference - its fresher and more lively. And while my acclaim may not be as rapturous as that of those who enjoyed it during its Opening Night world premiere at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival I am still heartily recommending it to anyone who cherishes the thought of a modern day musical spectacle.

"USATODAY.com - Moulin Rouge A dazzling wreck Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 05/17/2001 - Updated 0422 PM ET Moulin Rouge A dazzling wreck By Mike Clark USA TODAY Moulin Rouge (out of four) Stars Nicole Kidman Ewan McGregor John Leguizamo Jim Broadbent Richard Roxburgh Director Baz Luhrmann Distributor 20th Century Fox Rating PG-13 for sexual content Moulin Rouge may be a spectacularly awful movie but its also spectacularly drenched in color decor and other visual oh-la-la. So partly on merit and partly by default its a recent cosmetic novelty after a lackluster five months. But it also feels as if a dump truck has buried moviegoers in confetti and glitter for two hours.Set in Paris naturally in 1899 the Summer of Love the musical melange plays as if its makers ingested too many substances from Americas love-summer almost seven decades later. Read more Video Moulin Rouge trailer Photo Gallery Nicole Kidman The film veers into psychosis long before Topsy-Turvys Jim Broadbent (what a backstage-drama comedown) breaks into a rickety rendition of Like a Virgin. Broadbent ""covering"" Madonna is a footnote but the struggling stars of this folly are Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor -- she as the famed nightspots No. 1 courtesan fighting a Camille-caliber case of consumption and he as the struggling writer who loves her. Like so many other variations on this riff Kidmans Satine is both dying and promised to another. In this case hes a wealthy duke (Richard Roxburgh) who in return for her body and soul will bankroll Moulin Rouge owner Broadbents shot at becoming theatrically respectable. The famed nightspots regular Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo) offers musical counsel but at least he doesnt sing much. Kidman and McGregor do and though both can hit notes their thin voices hunger for vibrato. In one late number their tandem body language actually suggests Donny and Marie. Kidman is chilly and McGregors somewhat better but this isnt a love story where anyone -- by the way whats the intended demographic? -- will care about the stakes. In William Shakespeares Romeo + Juliet showoff director Baz Luhrmann (whose Strictly Ballroom was equally affected) had Leonardo DiCaprio/Claire Danes synergy to supply the emotional content. Here he doesnt have story or chemistry though itd be a lie to deny that Kidman seems born to her costumes. Because everything is so over the top the anachronistic songs -- Diamonds Are a Girls Best Friend The Polices Roxanne Elton Johns Your Song -- are less stupefying than in A Knights Tale. But this months Napster approach to period films wont wear any better in the long run than this cinematic migraine will in the short. Eliminate the visuals in Rouge and all involved should be wearing various shades of red.

The spectacle of pop songs employed in a period setting speaks to us in a new and galvanizing way but the movie also seems to have been made by a madman with a palm buzzer. The director Baz Luhrmann smashes all sense of time and space so that the floor of the Moulin Rouge comes off as a bad-trip version of Studio 54 crossed with the Star Wars cantina. As the courtesan Satine Nicole Kidman has an accomplished whiplash-dominatrix style but not perhaps the eccentric dynamism of a true star. She never quite connects with Ewan McGregor who as her bohemian lover strikes the only notes of real emotion in the movie.
