You guys can now put it in a cartoon form for kids. Great movie I love it. Damian Cowansaid on Monday November 26 2012 63241 PMthe final installment of the twilight franchise was amazing. Yes its things that could have been better but once you get to the end you forget all of it. Breaking Dawn is a must see movie. Celistasaid on Sunday November 25 2012 74038 PMFun indulgence of a film geared towards my demographic (i.e. those who appreciate Jacobs propensity to take his shirt off). The Twilight series is akin to indulging in a cheap paperback romance--a good way to pass the time during a rainy weekend afternoon not meant to be thought-provoking or a cinematic masterpiece. Nalasaid on Sunday November 25 2012 24836 PMI thought the first was great but the last is better. Ruby F.said on Thursday November 22 2012 71234 PMSo I went to see this movie with my boyfriend and I thought the cinematography was great Kudos to Guillermo Navaro. As for the editing and the story it really needs to be improved. The pacing of the whole story was told very fast and I really wish it could have lasted a bit longer especially with Renesme if Bella is that protective mother let her connect more with her daughter. We need to see it. Especially with the audience. CrazyDaveysaid on Friday November 16 2012 34527 PMIm just gonna skip this one.... just like all the other Twilight films. Seen the first one it was horrible... never again will I see anymore then that POST A COMMENT indicates required fieldName Email Website YouTubeResponse URL  ?

A popular childrens franchise after some awkward first steps had grown up and into a dark twisted epic and concluded with breathtaking finality its young actors finally filling out their onscreen personae as young men and women. Alas the same cannot be said of Breaking Dawn - Part 2 the final installment in the popular Twilight film run. If anything this series has gotten dumber and more inert as it has progressed with this last one finally reaching over into an extended wallow in camp. Forget the multiple cascading and intertangling plotlines of the Harry Potter series; Breaking Dawn struggles to keep even just one ball in the air. It didnt necessarily have to be like this. Anyway heres the plot Young Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) having given birth to her half-vampire daughter Renesmee with now-hubby Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) is finally reveling in the glorious new sensations not of motherhood but of vampirism -- as we may recall she had to be turned into an immortal after a rather nasty childbirth in the last installment. When the film opens Bellas red eyes are taking in her surroundings her heightened senses shivering with every sound touch and scent. ""Were the same temperature now"" Edward tells her. With their powers finally matched the two are now free to have merciless sex and they also whip through the forest hunting for blood leaping over waterfalls and seemingly aware of every rabbit and spider in the woods. Edwards protective instincts are still there however He has to stop a bloodthirsty Bella when they come across an unsuspecting mountain climber. (Alas the climber never looks down to see a cocktail-dress-clad K-Stew rapidly climbing the rock face towards him and were spared what might have been the greatest reaction shot in movie history.) But of course trouble is brewing. Renesmee is growing rapidly and soon enough the Volturi the ancient and aristocratic coven who act as enforcers in this undead world come a-calling convinced that shes that most uncontrollable of creatures an immortal child. The rule is that such children because their tantrums can rip through entire civilizations have to be destroyed on the spot. Thing is since Bella conceived and gave birth while still human the girl is actually not immortal. Good luck proving that to the preening trigger-happy Volturi however. As the ancient vampires (decked out in dandyish matching black military uniforms and capes that make them look like an invading army of Michael Jacksons) trudge their way to the Pacific Northwest Edward and his brethren convene as many witnesses as they can from all the corners of the world to testify to Renesmees non-immortality. Luckily these witnesses along with Bellas hunky werewolf friend Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) and his pack of gigantic canines also seem like theyd come in conveniently handy in an apocalyptic head-ripping fight to the finish. Dont get too excited though. Though the aforementioned first scenes promise heightened almost unbearable awareness of the world on Bellas part most of the film is pitched at the same mopey register as the forgettable soft rock songs on the soundtrack with everything underplayed to an alarming degree. You cant really blame the actors for whispering their lines unconvincingly as their dialogue consists almost entirely of either half-hearted exposition or stale sweet nothings. Of course thats been a problem for the series since the beginning but one wonders what might have happened if the films had taken a page out of the Potter adaptations and allowed for the desperation and fervor to build as the stakes increased. Indeed we have a working example of it as Michael Sheen playing the leader of the Volturi single-handedly breathes brief life into the film in its final scenes by allowing himself a genuine screech or two. (We know director Bill Condon can pull this sort of thing off If nothing else his musical Dreamgirls was passionate.) Maybe all this holding back is an attempt to counteract the inherent absurdity of the melodramatic material but the lifeless delivery actually has the effect of doubling down on the silliness -- it refuses to even try to engage us. Full disclosure Ive never read the books and it is my understanding that the finale of the film departs somewhat from the end of the novel. Not sure I want to give too much away but lets say that quite a bit of vampire and werewolf blood is spilled in the final act -- sort of. And it might have been both bloodcurdling and cathartic were it done with anything resembling sincerity or excitement (or even decent special effects) but even here Breaking Dawn 2 cant do anything but go through the motions. These actors cant even lose their heads with conviction.

"Twilight Breaking Dawn Part Two | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; twilight-breaking-dawn-part-two ) Twilight Breaking Dawn Part Two (United States 2012) November 16 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli Im of two minds about Breaking Dawn Part 2. Although it includes the most intense sequence in any of the movies it also features an unforgivable example of motion picture bait-and-switch. Its deflating a desperate attempt to make the finale of Stephenie Meyers vampire saga more cinematic while remaining reasonably faithful to the book. What was it someone said about having ones cake and eating it too? Gyp to swindle cheat or defraud. That just about covers it. On the other hand with Breaking Dawn Part 2 darkness falls on the Twilight series. Im not a religious man but Hallelujah I may not be done with Meyer but at least Ill never again have to cope with the angst self-absorption and vampire mythology mutilation that characterized these five movies. Breaking Dawn Part 2 starts out slowly with a smattering of comedy proceeds to sputter when it should be picking up steam provides a rousing 20-minute pseudo-finale then crashes and burns in unspectacular fashion. The movie ends with a vision of the future that offers a startlingly unambiguous celebration of pedophilia. (How about a guy in his early 20s paired with a seven-year old?) Somehow that one got past the MPAA. The movie is oddly structured due in part to its being the second half of a financially motivated bifurcation. From start to finish Breaking Dawn Part 2 struggles with pacing issues. For nearly an hour its lighthearted with moments of intentional and unintentional comedy (although Condon is savvy enough that even the unintentional instances - such as about half the lines of dialogue - are offered with tongue in cheek). Theres a nice little scene where newly minted vampire Bella (Kristen Stewart) kicks the shit out of werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner) while hubby Edward (Robert Pattinson) watches in amusement. Breaking Dawn Part 2 begins pretty much where Breaking Dawn Part 1 ended with Bella going through Vampirism 101. Bellas first meal is a mountain lion because killing an innocent deer might be considered cruel. She learns that vampires have beds even though they dont sleep. And with Meyer having stripped away all the traditional vampire negatives (like burning up in sunlight) she discovers that the only bad thing about her new lifestyle choice is that she cant be a vegetarian (or presumably a member of PETA). Eventually the Volturi come calling led by Michael Sheens Aro and Dakota Fannings Jane. Sheen appears to have studied high profile examples of overacting and incorporates a little of everything into his work here. Aro is far too campy to be frightening or intimidating looking like he stepped out of a Rocky Horror Picture Show revival. Fanning wears equally garish make-up but her dialogue is limited to a single word ""Pain."" My two-year old son has a more extensive vocabulary. All the regulars do their regular things although in fairness Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner are more comfortable in their roles if not necessarily better. They neednt start writing their Oscar speeches. Kristen Stewart seems more relaxed as a vampire although the character still has her share of PMS moments despite the fact that vampires cant get PMS. All three of the leads take off their shirts at some time during the proceedings. For Jacob the camera soaks in every detail - it is after all a greatly anticipated moment. Stewart and Pattinson get naked for a sex scene but since the movie is PG-13 the only nipples in view are Pattinsons. Consult On the Road to see Stewarts. As for the big climactic battle... taken completely out of context its a lot of fun. Its chock full of surprises and visceral moments. Several characters meet grisly ends. Theres plenty of wolf-on-vampire action and Dakota Fanning gets to say her single word a couple of times. The conflict is effectively choreographed and directed. Condons approach is very much of the ""kitchen sink"" variety. Unfortunately its impossible to take this sequence out of context and what it ultimately represents is so dispiriting that it nearly destroys the rest of the movie. Ill probably never understand the popularity of the Twilight movies. Theyre haphazardly assembled adaptations of awful books. At one time films of this sort would have been targeted for direct-to-DVD release. But theres a large passionate fan base and we have them to thank for five movies that reinforce just about every negative stereotype about todays youth. The best thing I can say about Breaking Dawn Part 2 is that the end credits mean Ill never have to watch a vampire sparkle again.

Its an apt word to stress signifying both the deathless devotion the series has inspired in legions of ferocious fans and the interminable tedium these rather inelegantly protracted films present to the unconverted. Neither camps minds are going to be changed by Bill Condons alternately thudding and thrilling closer but that is as it should be right down to the celebratory parade of every participating player across all five films in the end credits Breaking Dawn - Part 2 is less a freestanding film than a victory lap for a franchise that hasnt wavered in its commitment to its fanbase. Thats a gentle way of saying that Part 2 does little to prove the necessity of splitting Stephenie Meyers concluding novel Deathly Hallows-style into two halves. The bulk of the books most savoury action - sullen teen Bella Swans long-delayed sexual awakening mutant pregnancy and conversion to the bloodsucking faith - was covered in last years gratifyingly bonkers exercise in junior Cronenbergia. That leaves the follow-up a rather talky affair for its first half while the Cullen clan pad around their luxury woodland lodge discussing intricate global vampire politics and wearing gilets the film most resembles an underexposed Next catalogue. By and by however an engaging sense of humour emerges even flirting with self-parody when Taylor Lautners lupine Jacob - whose eerily marzipan-like consistency even in wolf form remains his sole interesting feature - perfunctorily gets his kit off before Bellas horrified dad. Across both the Breaking Dawn films that playfulness has been Condons chief gift to the series. It pays off grandly in a riotous showdown between the heroes and the malevolent Michael Sheen-led Volturi tribe which finds an absurdly ingenious way both to preserve and subvert the contentiously passive climax of Meyers novel. Most energised of all for once is Kristen Stewart often unfairly maligned for a performance restricted by the maddeningly morose behaviour of Bella in human form. Reborn as a vampire her newly red eyes visibly glint with the pleasure of finally getting to kick some ass leaving all memories of Edward-Jacob love tussles for the inconsequential dust they are. If we learn anything from this silly but satisfying finale its that everyone could stand to get some vampire in them.

Photo Andrew Cooper SMPSP Summit Entertainment Image 14 of 14 The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn - Part 2 1 / 14 Back to Gallery You can only kill a vampire by pulling off his head and setting his body on fire something that happens with comic frequency in ""The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn - Part 2."" Its a movie so dull you might start yanking on your own head after about an hour. By now ""Twilight"" is a closed club which means that a ""Twilight"" movie doesnt have to operate according to the rules of drama. The rules of a vacation video will suffice A little wave a little preening a nod to the location and an affirmation of the principal relationships are all thats required. Like ""Breaking Dawn - Part 1"" this second installment was directed by Bill Condon who has made some good movies (""Kinsey"" ""Gods and Monsters"") and has earned the right to put away a little something for his retirement. What started as the love of a teenage girl Bella (Kristen Stewart) and a teenage vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) has now become a mature married relationship. At the end of the last installment Bella gave birth to a half-vampire child and then like a wife assuming her husbands politics became a vampire herself. At the start of ""Breaking Dawn - Part 2"" Bella loves the vampire life and cant stop talking about how much she enjoys her heightened senses and being awake all the time kind of like the way people used to talk about cocaine in the 70s. In an early scene Bella and Edward have vampire sex for the first time after which she comments ""You really were holding back before."" Its a cute line but its a measure of something lost. The power of ""Twilight"" was the power of metaphor. Edwards fear of having sex with Bella and potentially hurting her was an inversion of an adolescent girls anxiety about a first sexual experience. Having Bella and Edward consummate their relationship transcends the metaphor and takes them into the realm of boring literalness. ""So beautiful ..."" Those are the first words spoken in ""Breaking Dawn - Part 2."" Edward ever affectionate speaks the words to Bella who is as casual and mystifyingly average as ever and thus a perfect surrogate for the audiences romantic projections. As always Stewart is regally confident and has an appealing intelligence but its Pattinson as Edward who has a spring in his step a newfound ease. Perhaps its just Edward happy to have the girl of his dreams. Or maybe its the relief of a good actor knowing hell never have to make another one of these awful movies again. The story of ""Breaking Dawn - Part 2"" is very simple almost like a parable. The Volturi a huge coven of Italian vampires find out that Bella and Edward have a child and they assume the child is 100 percent vampire. Apparently thats forbidden - vampires cant have babies - and so they set out to kill the child. The bulk of the movie is taken up with Edward and Bella assembling a team of vampire associates who will testify to the Volturi that the child is mortal - or fight the Volturi if necessary. Be honest You didnt read the above paragraph did you? I cant blame you. Basically were dealing here with a movie about a bunch of thoroughly unappealing sketchily created unlovably eccentric vampire characters waiting around for the Volturi to show up so they can all pull each others heads off. Heres the problem Between Bella and Edwards friends and the Volturi ... there isnt really much difference no real moral difference certainly. The Volturi have better outfits. Long coats. Theyre Italian. They have fashion sense. One final question If theyve been alive for 800 years why does every female vampire sound like a Valley Girl? Are they endlessly adaptive or did they all really stand out in Victorian England? The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn - Part 2 Vampire romantic fantasy.

SUMMIT ENTERTAINMENT She was a pale sullen American teenager. He was a lank-haired loner from another world. They fell in love anyway building a bond that transcended their differences and confounded the naysayers. But then an ugly new challenge arose. Would they survive it together? But enough about K-Stew and R-Patz. Instead its time for Bella and Edward and the fifth and (it seems) final film in the ""Twilight"" franchise as the mortal girl turned vampire and the vampire turned reluctant Romeo try to keep their new life (and strange new child) safe from the unforgiving Volturi coven. The movie adaptations have become such a phenomenon (and the lives of their co-stars such a soap opera) that its hard to believe it was just four years ago that film fans were first introduced to this world of glittering bloodsuckers gigantic werewolves and mopey safe-for-Starbucks soundtracks. Harder still to accept that its finally coming to an end. But yes our long national frightmare is over -- and the awkwardly titled ""The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn -- Part 2"" wraps it up capably enough for diehard Twihards with some new characters and a pull-out-all-stops (and pull-off-all-heads) final battle. Of course some of the problems that nonfans had with the series remain. The run-faster leap-higher quality of vampirism still seems a little silly (although not quite as silly as Peter Facinellis dyed hair). Unlike the rest of the actors villainous Michael Sheen plays his part for high camp and the werewolves look too big and too fake. But the storyline of this last two-part film (and perhaps new director Bill Condon) has erased the strongest objection some people had -- that the saga was just a slightly retro sermon in which boys are supposed to be forceful leaders and girls are supposed to be obedient and chaste. Bella is stronger here literally and more in charge. And after the laborious exposition of ""Part 1"" ""Part 2"" is able to reap the benefits tying together some disparate threads and providing real action at the end. It was the same advantage that the last half of ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" had too -- although ""Twilight"" sadly isnt in that league. But then it never was even as fiction. J.K. Rowling conjured up deep moral lessons and casts of rich characters; ""Twilight"" novelist Stephenie Meyer struggled to create a single mood barely bridled passion. So when the final fight happens yes you care about Edward and Bella. But seriously do you have any true attachment to any of the Cullen coven? Can you even tell the werewolves apart? (Anna Kendricks Jessica the most appealing supporting character left at the beginning of the last film.) The climax is full of action but emotions are harder to find. Apart from the fey Sheen who carries on as if hes still in one of those ""Underworld"" movies the actors are as dull and dutiful as theyve always been. Robert Pattinson lowers his head and smiles to himself. Kristen Stewart looks perpetually put-upon even when being made love to. Tyler Lautner thinks very hard and then unbuttons his shirt. There is a bit more discreetly PG-13 lovemaking between Bella and Edward too (which drew sighs from a preview audience). Also some declarations of endless love from Bella which had a few cynics in the house snickering given the co-stars recent real-life relationship troubles. But this is not a movie for cynics or for people who have to be reminded who Dakota Fanning is playing or why Lautner is so oddly obsessed with Bellas daughter. This is for people who were on Team Edward from Day One. Who bought the posters and T-shirts and bought into the whole fantasy. For four years theyve happily been letting this franchise suck their wallets dry. And for them at last this is the big bloody beautiful payoff. Ratings note The film contains sexual situations and graphic violence. The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn - Part 2 (PG-13) Summit (115 min.) Directed by Bill Condon.

"Twilight Breaking Dawn Part 2 reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Twilight Breaking Dawn Part 2 No More Love Triangle No More Fun Twilight Breaking Dawn Part 2 No More Love Triangle No More Fun Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 15 2012 731 PM Twilight Breaking Dawn Part 2 Kind of bloodless. By Dana Stevens Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart in Twilight Breaking Dawn Part 2 Photograph by Doane Gregory - (c) 2011 Summit Entertainment LLC. The very title Breaking Dawn Part 2 hints at what the movie sadly reveals to be the case The Twilight franchise has overstayed its welcome. Splitting the last book in Stephenie Meyers teen-vampire series into two separate movies may have been a wise business decision--with guaranteed throngs of adoring Twihards willing to go back for multiple viewings why not eke out an extra sequel?--but it leaves the last film in the series with no place to go. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Of course one might argue that none of the four previous Twilight films have had any place to go. The world of Twilight is intermittently action-packed but dramatically static. The storys central love triangle--mortal Bella vampire Edward werewolf Jacob--exists in a state of unconsummated tension on all sides The purpose of the movies is in essence to contemplate the mystery of this holy trinity. This curiously placid devotional quality is part of what I liked about the first four Twilight films They lulled the viewer into a somnolent daze that mimicked their spacey heroines perpetual love-fog. Breaking Dawn Part 2 (directed like its predecessor by Bill Condon) gets the ""somnolent daze"" feeling right but with the sexual heat gone from the center of the story now that Bella and Edward have done the deed the only thing left for viewers to contemplate is the sanctity of the nuclear family (which compared to the lurid joys of human-on-vampire dry humping seems a pallid prize indeed). When we last saw Bella (Kristen Stewart) she had finally been changed into a vampire by her long-resistant undead husband Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) in a last-ditch effort to save her from dying while giving birth to their monstrously fast-growing half-vampire/half-human child Renesmee. (Its a portmanteau of her grandmothers first names OK?) Breaking Dawn Part 1 ended on the image of Bellas eyes popping open on the delivery table ablaze with a new unquenchable fire the irises changed from brown to a coppery red. As Breaking Dawn Part 2 begins we look at the world through those transformed eyes the pollen on a flower the down on a bumblebee all appear in extra-sharp relief. Damsel-in-distress Bella has now become superfast superstrong and tireless--after she and Edward have vampire sex for the first time she observes with wonder that shell no longer need sleep in between their marathon sex bouts. These are conducted in a Thomas Kinkade-esque cottage that the Cullen coven have provided for the newlyweds behind their more stark modern house. Advertisement In a plot development thats consistent with the Twilight series ongoing propensity for unacknowledged incestuous creepiness Bellas lupine ex-suitor Jacob (Taylor Lautner) has now ""imprinted"" on her daughter (not in that way Hes just bound by werewolf instinct to protect her from harm Renesmee that is). This arrangement by dissolving the sexual tension between Jacob and Bella allows the once-dangerous Edward/Jacob rivalry to be subsumed into a stable family unit with Lautners character as a kind of neutered babysitter. All in all life as a vampire is pretty sweet even if Bella has to lie to her father (a severely underused Billy Burke) about her new existential status. But then the Volturi--a kind of Vatican council of vampire high priests headed up by an impish scene-stealing Michael Sheen--get a tip about the birth of the half-breed vampire baby and determine that the entire Cullen family must be destroyed. About an hour in it starts to occur to you that for creatures capable of moving through space so quickly theyre perceptible only as gray blurs the Volturi are taking their sweet time getting from Italy to Forks Wash. The Cullen clan spends eons standing around in front of modern-art installations trading fretful observations about the impending vampire civil war. They enlist a militia of rebel vampires from around the world to their side (including a pair of disgruntled immortals still smarting from the Volturis seizure of their castles 1500 years ago) and even get some backup from their erstwhile enemies the werewolves. By the time the great vampire showdown finally got started I was good and done with Breaking Dawn Part 2. But the big action scene is so campily over the top--with one twist so unforeseeable--that it sent me out on a burst of grudging goodwill. The films endlessly drawn-out ending with its multiple spoken and written iterations of the books last word ""forever"" over an image of the matte-skinned cultishly beatific Cullens may be the scariest moment in the whole pulpy yet vital Twilight series--a teenage girls fantasy of perfect domestic contentment frozen in time and doomed to last forever.

That means an initial hour or so of soap-opera story line which begins abruptly where ""Part 1"" left off with newly minted vampire Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) and her undead husband Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) fretting over their child Renesmee (Mackenzie Foy).

Not only has the tot magically bonded with well-toned werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner) shes being hunted by the Volturi led by the sinister Aro (a deliciously hammy Michael Sheen). ""Part 2"" is also the first time that Bella a hitherto sulky and useless character actually does something. She hunts she fights and in bed she gives as good as she gets. (""You really were holding back before"" she tells Edward.) Stewart wears her blood-red vampire eyes well and her newly mature beauty is striking. 048 VideoTrailer The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn - Part 2 But director Bill Condon who revealed glimmers of mischief in ""Part 1"" is just setting us up for what may go down as one of the best pranks in cinema a sudden explosion of outrageous and horrific violence that pushes the PG-13 rating to its edge. advertisement | advertise on newsday The audacious narrative twists toy with fans emotions with such sadistic glee that you can almost hear Condon cackling (or maybe thats Sheen). ""Part 2"" is a big bloody kiss to fans with all the familiar faces (Billy Burke as Bellas endearing dad Peter Facinelli as the dignified Carlisle Cullen) plus a yearbook ending (remember Anna Kendrick as Bellas chatty schoolmate?). The first ""Twilight"" film that could get non-fans hearts pumping turns out to be the last.

Must have dreamily passionate -- but not overtly sexual -- scenes of Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) and Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) early on to get the crowd swooning.2. Hunky werewolf Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) must strip off his shirt at least once and show off his well-toned pecs and abs.3. Vampire velocity must be highlighted as they whoosh and sprint in their trademark rapid-fire style.4. Most important the vampire couple at the center of things Edward and Bella (she became a blood-sucker at the end of Part 1) must conclude the conflict with a tender make-out session in a gorgeous natural setting.The final chapter based on Stephenie Meyers best-selling novels starts slowly with risible dialogue but picks up in the second hour during an action-packed battle pitting Cullens family and their new allies the werewolves against the Volturi a rival troupe of vampires who see themselves as the arbiters of all things undead. Believing that Bella and Edwards baby Renesmee is some sort of vampire/human abomination the Volturi are primed for a massive fight.The finale features a diverse cross-section of Cullen kin from as far away as Russia and South America. But cousins from nearby Alaska (the story takes place in Washington state) look disturbingly like they just came from an audition for Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.Hair and make-up are only a couple of factors that seem schlocky. Special effects -- particularly the computer-generated wolves -- look surprisingly second-rate. Worse are the bad screenplay lackluster performances and turgid pacing. Lautners abs are the only taut thing about this tween-centered soap opera.Though Bella is now a super-strong bloodthirsty vampire Stewarts bored delivery and sulky expression remain intact. Her quips come off as bland snark rather than humorous asides. Better performances come from supporting players like Billy Burke as Charlie Swan Bellas dad.As Aro the leader of the Volturi Michael Sheen hams it up with a vengeance a malevolent imps glint in his red eyes. Dakota Fanning plays one of his key acolytes. Shes supposed to send shivers down the audiences spine as she stands around and glares vapidly perhaps having caught Stewarts dour-faced disease.Amid the action are sweet moments with cute Renesmee (Mackenzie Foy) the oddly named baby born to the now married Bella and Edward. The child passes speedily from infancy (where the digital enhancement makes her look like an alien being) to girlhood. Mostly it seems shes on hand to make fans adore Edward and Bella all the more. Now they dont just stare into each others eyes they have an angelic moppet to coo over.But the final scene is all vamp love all the time -- in a floral greeting-card setting.Fans of the series which has made more than 2 billion worldwide will no doubt find it all terribly romantic and deeply meaningful.

Or a girl. In Breaking Dawn-Part 2 the magically schlocky last (please) installment of The Twilight Saga Bella Cullen nee Swan (Kristen Stewart) is officially a vampire. Shes incredibly strong and capable--no harnesses needed if Bella wants to rock climb; she pretty much flies these days--and now she and Edward (Robert Pattinson) can have mutually rough vampire sex 24/7 if they want complete with orgasms that sparkle like a disco ball. ""You really were holding back before"" Bella murmurs preparing to mount her husband again. Even better the sulks moodiness and lip biting are gone. Vampire Bella is even funny. ""You think you have some sort of moronic wolfie claim on her?"" she bellows at her former suitor Jacob (Taylor Lautner) who has transferred his affections to her newborn half-vampire half-mortal daughter Renesmee. (He imprinted. Its a wolf thing.) By the time Bella wakes after her traumatic-caesarian-section-by-teeth as seen in BD-Part 1 Jacob has taken to calling the child Nessie which seems a reasonable approach to a name fit to crush the spirits of elocutionists everywhere. ""You nicknamed my daughter after the Loch Ness monster?"" The movie is a wildly campy action-packed end to what has been a stultifying though undeniably beloved series; I have resisted each installment but had a shrieking good time at this one. Whats the difference? Director Bill Condon shot both parts of Breaking Dawn the last of Stephenie Meyers four Twilight books simultaneously and using the same screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg who adapted the other three books for the screen. But this time the age of avoidance and resistance is over; its not just the virtue of a young mortal in love with an extremely well mannered vampire at stake its the future of a Very Special Child and the entire Cullen clan. (READ All the rotten but true things this reviewer said about Breaking Dawn-Part 1) The fascist police of the vampire world the Volturi based in Italy and led by Aro (an over-the-top hilarious Michael Sheen) and Jane (Dakota Fanning who is not in the least constrained by acting only with her eyes) do not take kindly to the news of Renesmees presence among the Cullens. Not realizing her origins they assume shes an immortal child one who has been turned into a vampire and is forever uncontrollable trapped in the terrible twos forever. ""A single tantrum could destroy a whole village"" the Cullen familys ""dad"" Carlisle (Peter Facinelli) explains. The Volturi eliminated all immortal children centuries ago in the only way you can get rid of one of Meyers vampires pulling off their heads and tossing them into flames. This could happen to Renesmee (played from infancy on by spooky little beauty Mackenzie Foy) although I dont see why they couldnt try telling the Volturi shes Bellas American Girl doll a totally plausible fib. The Cullens resident clairvoyant Alice (Ashley Greene) forsees that the Volturi will come when ""the snow sticks to the ground."" (Why the delay? Soccer season in Italy?) They all assume the Volturi wont listen to reason in regard to Renesmee so in preparation they gather ""witnesses"" from all over the world (including Ireland the Brazilian rain forest the Middle East) to bear testimony to the truth of the matter. The logic here is dubious at best especially since no one can lie to Aro. All he has to do is touch someone to know the truth. But logic has never been the strong suit of the Cullens. Who else would give Bella and Edward a cosy ivy-covered fully decorated cottage of their own right nearby and then immediately announce that it was time to leave Washington state so that Bellas dad Charlie (Billy Burke) doesnt figure out shes turned into a vampire. (Never fear Jacob has a most excellent way of handling that problem. Shirtless.) (READ The last time Mary Pols claimed a Twilight movie was the ""best so far."" Clearly shes on Team Jacob.) I do appreciate the Cullens sense of home decor however which they often seem a part of. The vampires have a habit of grouping themselves in their modern living room paired off like tasteful ottomans and easy chairs while the camera pans over their faces smiling or looking concerned as the situation calls for. The framing of these Twi-oramas is somewhere between soap opera and the cover shoots for Vanity Fairs annual Hollywood issue. Their frozen quality speaks to the chronic lack of action in the series. This time the camera has to work overtime to make sure all of the visiting witnesses are included. Every time a shot paused on the Irish vampires--red heads dressed in various shades of green fisherman sweaters and tweed caps--the audience howled at the sublime artifice. Saturday Night Live couldnt parody Twilight better than Breaking Dawn-Part 2 itself does. But thats nothing compared to the howls that greeted the big dramatic showdown in a snowy field between Cullen and Co. and the Volturi. Many of the witnesses have X-Men-like special powers--influencing the elements lightning bolts from the finger tips and such. My personal favorites are the duo whose only gift is sounding just like Count Chocula. Even though the Cullens are outnumbered by the Volturi theres potential for a good brawl. No spoilers but what happens is far more dramatic and zesty than I ever would have predicted; even the dedicated Twilight fans in attendance at my screening seemed thoroughly shocked by some of it (slight spoiler a little deviation from the book). The production still looks as cheap as a Sears commercial (though this movie was reportedly the most expensive of the five) and the special effects are as usual terrible but all this jellsperfectly with Condons B-movie atmosphere of melodrama and mayhem. Should I go so far as to describe Breaking Dawn-Part 2 the way Aro describes Renesmee after a fabulous mad cackle as ""magnifico""? No. And I hope to God there isnt some Disney-George-Lucas-style deal where we are consigned to endless Twilight movies. But while parting involved no sorrow it was sweeter than expected.

Ignore those of us outside the faith who wouldnt know a Volturi from a Volkswagen; this outrageously grand finale is a fan-service fiesta. Pouty heroine Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart more lively than usual) has completed her vampiric transformation and she spends most of the films first half running wild through both the woods and an Ikea-catalog bedroom with her broody undead husband Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). Married life is bliss; even third-wheel werewolf Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) has subsumed his romantic jealousies by becoming protector of Mr. and Mrs. Cullens half-vamp half-human child Renesmee (Mackenzie Foy). But lo Borgia-like bloodsucker Aro (a spectacularly hammy Michael Sheen) and his clan are out to destroy the Cullens for a perceived transgression. An epic battle on the ice awaits and heads will roll. Mourn Twi-Haters BDP2s cringeworthy idiocies are more plentiful than ever WB teen-drama performances risible dialogue (""You nicknamed my baby after the Loch Ness monster??"") and the most shameless T.Laut striptease yet. Plus all the PG-13 lechery still makes for a cognitively dissonant mishmash with the storys weirdly retrograde undercurrents. (Edward and Bellas abstinence-until-wedlock love affair is practically a Victorian consumptive disease.) As billion-dollar Hollywood franchises go this is one of the drawn-out dumbest. The stake through the heart comes not a moment too soon.

Matt Gillmer Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Even the happiest marriage can feel like a war. But what if the relationship really was a killing field with husband wife in-laws friends and far-flung relations literally trying to exterminate each other? And what if that was really hard because theyre mostly undead? This is the world of ""Breaking Dawn Part 2"" where Mr. and Mrs. Edward Cullen work through some domestic issues in a combat-zone blowout sufficient to bring down a medium-sized country. In the final film installment in the ""Twilight"" franchise the evil Volturi vampire clan feeling threatened by the birth of Bella and Edwards half-vamp offspring mount a blitzkrieg on Forks Wash. The Cullens recruit a league of allies with X-Men style magical powers to fight back. Since the only way to destroy a vampire in Stephenie Meyers mythology is to separate the cranium from the shoulders the film features more beheadings than a ""Game of Thrones"" marathon. If you think the premise is absurd wait till you see the execution. Logic and plausibility are not commodities valued by fans of the immensely popular ""Twilight"" series and here theyre abandoned entirely. The films motto could be ""Look dont think."" Stars Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson are lavished with visual caresses by director Bill Condon and lenser Guillermo Navarro to an extraordinary degree which certainly makes the pictures romantic scenes easy on the eyes. We begin with Bella adjusting to her new status as a bloodsucker having been turned by Edward to prevent her dying during childbirth. Oddly Stewarts acting was more corpse-like when she was playing a mortal. Having crossed over to the undead shes livelier and more expressive. The newlyweds live in acute domestic luxury occupying an idyllic forest cottage evidently based on a Thomas Kinkade painting. Their little mutant bundle of bliss Renesmee grows faster than humans do reaching a toddlers size in just weeks. Eleven-year-old Mackenzie Foy plays the girl at six months of age. In earlier scenes and a flash-forward Renesmee is an eerie fusion of child actors and wide-eyed digital face painting. Video (5909) Breaking Dawn Robert Pattison So for a time the biggest challenge facing the couple is keeping Bellas policeman dad Charlie (Billy Burke) from asking too many questions about why his granddaughter shot up 6 inches between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Since a comic scene of supernatural show-and-tell with Taylor Lautners werewolf Jacob reminds us that Charlie is North Americas least inquisitive cop its easier to believe hell swallow anything. A weird amalgam of hard action and soft romance ""Breaking Dawn"" is most amusing when the Cullens their ethnically stereotyped multicultural allies and the swarming Volturi are hell-bent on mutual annihilation. Condon stages the frenetic battle royal with frenetic energy and no small amount of humor. The sequence is a showcase for Michael Sheens campy cackling vampire chieftain Aro. Sheen makes a lark of his scenes. But theres too little of him and too much of everything else. ""Breaking Dawn Part 2"" doesnt end the series on an especially strong note but it ends it.

The bizarre jolting body horror that marked the penultimate installment of the franchise is absent in the wheel-spinning final chapter--unless you count the unease felt when witnessing the CGI crimes committed against the face of Renesmee (Mackenzie Foy) the child of Bella and Edward (Robert Pattinson) whose features are digitally altered to match her varying ages from infant to late adolescent. The moppets very existence sets the stop-start plot in motion The Volturi that Rome-based cabal of vampires led by Michael Sheen and some other guys in Adam Ant regalia mistakenly believe that Renesmee is an ""immortal child"" and thus a threat to the entire living-dead existence. To prepare for the battle with this Continental syndicate Edward and his family aided by Jacob (Taylor Lautner) and his wolf pack summon vampires from around the globe. This motley lot--the women bloodsuckers all seem to resemble lip-augmented Tampa trophy wives; the men hollow-cheeked consumptives who look like VIPs at the clubs SNLs Stefon frequents--are given ample time to explain and demonstrate their special powers. Its about as exciting as watching David Blaine play Stratego and makes you miss the power of the first four films all the more the uncontainable yearning of the Bella-Edward-Jacob triangle.

"Movie Review Twilight Breaking Dawn 2 - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs By the finale Twilight vampire series is mostly anemic  1/2November 15 2012|Michael Phillips | Movie criticThe fifth and very likely final ""Twilight"" picture boasts one moment perhaps three or four seconds in length so delightfully intense and uncharacteristically juicy that the rest of the film -- most of the rest of the whole series in fact -- looks pretty pale by comparison. Not vampire pale. Paler.I refer to Michael Sheen as Aro chief executive officer of the undead Volturi and the president of the Gleeful British Ham Actors Union. At the moment in question Aro mistakenly believes the daughter of Bella Swan the human turned vampire and Edward Cullen the Byronic bloodsucker to be an immortal child who must be killed. Everyones standing around outside under gray skies and theres snow and its cold and Sheens Aro spies the child and his red eyes light up and he concocts this fantastic combination of a giggle and a cackle. Its a great close-up scary and funny both. Now theres a technician at work An actor actually acting. Overacting actually. But who cares?With so much somnambulant underplaying going on around him with so many scenes of well-dressed vampires sitting or standing stiffly while Taylor Lautner or Robert Pattinson or Kristen Stewart passes another micro-slab of dialogue like a kidney stone the overactings greatly appreciated thanks.""The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn -- Part 2"" picks up where ""The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn -- Part 1"" left off. Newly vampired Bella is adjusting to her new powers her new life her new extended family the uneasy truce with the wolves led by Lautners man-wolf Jacob. And the kid The kid is a huge adjustment. Also it must be a huge disappointment to Bella that all the vampires in ""Twilight"" look sillier in each successive movie whenever one of these superfast creatures runs superfast through the woods of the American northwest in pursuit of a deer or a mountain lion. Or simply scoots over to a bookshelf in a hurry.How can they move so fast while the fifth film not two hours in length feels so slow? Director Bill Condon who handled ""Breaking Dawn -- Part 1"" with a modicum of sly camp returns here arranging everyone in the group scenes like eerie poseurs in a particularly smug fashion shoot. He has made stylish interesting films. His ""Twilight"" films are not two of them though Condon does muster some head-snapping panache for the films climax in which an informal world council of vampires shows up to do battle with the Volturi. The touchingly misguided folks at the Motion Picture Association of America classification and ratings administration have allowed this melee of decapitations to get by with a PG-13. Presumably this is payback for all that earnest abstinence in the first few hundred minutes of the ""Twilight"" saga.I harbor some affection for the first two ""Twilight"" films but by the third the crushing solemnity of the storytelling started to grate. This franchise hasnt much in common with the ""Harry Potter"" films beyond the supernatural appeal. But those efforts earned a casual Potter fans trust and buy-in most every time. With the ""Twilight"" movies taken from Stephenie Meyers books its different; you really do have to sign some sort of pre-adoration contract before buying a ticket.OK and this is bugging me for some reason The Volturi are somehow stupid enough to mistake Bellas daughter for something she isnt? What kind of stupid vampires are these vampires? And now that Ive been sucked into this petty mythological trivia question I suppose it proves that some part of me will miss ""Twilight.""

Summit Entertainment photo Ladies who love vampires know that once you go Drac you never go back.As Bella Swan the mopey mortal heroine of the ""Twilight"" series Kristen Stewart has been saving her energy like her character has been saving her virginity. But after Bella and reformist vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) did the dirty deed and hatched a little bloodsucker at the end of ""Breaking Dawn -- Part 1"" the actress was set free. In the campy over-amped finale of the film series Stewart seems to have had a transfusion of new blood -- and shes got the fiery red eyes to prove it.""The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn -- Part 2"" is a payoff for our patience through the four preceding movies. Its not a good film but viewed from a cockeyed angle its a great guilty pleasure and director Bill Condon is in on the joke. Condon has made prestige dramas such as ""Gods and Monsters"" and ""Kinsey"" but like Bella he is torn between two illicit loves horror movies and musicals. This mutant spawn of oversized genres is like a tuneless Andrew Lloyd Webber adaptation of ""The Omen.""In the woods of Washington the newly bitten Bella Cullen emerges from her maternity bed to discover shes got two new arrivals in her life daughter Renesmee and an insatiable sex drive. While pale and pretty Edward attends to Bellas bodily needs in their fairy-tale cottage also-ran werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner) bonds with baby Renesmee. When the evil vampire clan called the Volturi catches wind of a newborn baby who might betray their way of life the banshees fly from Rome to find and exterminate Renesmee. Meanwhile Edward and Bella travel by Volvo to enlist ""witnesses"" who can explain to the Volturi that the rapidly growing girl is nothing to worry about. Eventually the Cullens army of allies includes world-wise recruits from Russia Morocco Ireland and the Amazon rain forest -- who bare their fangs at the first sight of Michael Sheen Dakota Fanning et al. in hooded black robes. The free-for-all finale with werewolves tumbling into an icy charm and gloomy goths getting beheaded by the dozens is so bizarre and cathartic we want it to last forever. But in the world of ""Twilight"" the things that last forever are longing glances limpid pop songs and lingering threats of a sequel. As long as Renesmee is out there somewhere riding a werewolf in the misty moonlight the horror may not be over.What ""The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn -- Part 2""  Two and a half stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 155  Content Violence disturbing images and some sensuality Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

The films based on Stephenie Meyers vampire-romance series have been desperately uneven but even the worst of them feeds a desire that so few movies today even attempt to fulfill Theres so little go-for-broke romance anymore and the on-again off-again liaison between human girl Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) and vampire boy Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) - with a little intrigue thrown in by werewolf dude Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) - has offered a vision of fairy-tale love thats at least half visceral tooth-and-claw vital the way real-life love affairs sometimes are. So what if the other half comes straight out of an old Loves Baby Soft commercial? But ""The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn - Part 2"" brings the series to a bumpy landing. Both this capper and its earlier half last years placenta-sploodge extravaganza ""Breaking Dawn - Part 1"" were directed by Bill Condon (""Gods and Monsters"" ""Kinsey"") who gave the series a much-needed jolt of Frankenstein-style electricity after the fake-fur cheesiness of 2009s ""New Moon"" and 2010s ""Eclipse."" (Those were directed by Chris Weitz and David Slade respectively.) In ""Part 1"" Condon served up sex that literally breaks the bed and a childbirth scene that Dario Argento would have been proud of. But ""Part 2"" is humdrum despite the presence of a half-human half-vampire superchild and a balls-out battle between the vampire-and-werewolf gang and a bunch of pseudo-ecclesiastical authority figures known as the Volturi. For those of you who are not up to speed on the ""Twilight"" mythology - well at this point God help you. While ""Breaking Dawn - Part 1"" was zany enough and entertaining enough to almost work as a stand-alone ""Part 2"" relies on mad rushes of exposition to explain exactly whats at stake here. In short Bella and Edward have had a child who has been given the dorky made-up name Renesmee. (In ""Part 1"" the name was actually the butt of a joke or two.) Renesmee is growing by leaps and bounds - like by two pounds a minute or something. By age 4 shes likely to be a 78-year-old chain-smoking Bingo aficionado reflecting on the life that went by all too fast. But as we learn later in the movie it doesnt quite work that way. Anyhow Jacob is not the father of little Renesmee though he will have an important role in her life. And thats a good thing because she may need to lean on his considerable brawn The Volturi are angry with Bella Edward and their extended family because they believe the Cullen clan has broken a serious law by harboring a demon child . Did I mention that Bella is now a vampire with both superstrength and super bloodthirst? Apparently that makes for some really hot and tireless vampire-on-vampire sex although unfortunately the movie sketches that out only in the most glancing way. Condon and screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg fill the movie up with something resembling but not actually equaling suspense as Bella Edward and Jacob rush to assemble a team of witnesses who will persuade the Volturi that little Renesmee - while possessing special powers - actually means no harm. Nay say the Volturi led by Michael Sheen in bad Pagliacci greasepaint. For sure Renesmee is part of a breed of bad-seed toddler vampires. ""A single tantrum could destroy an entire village"" Sheen explains though that really only means hes never been to Park Slope on a Saturday. The battle that ensues between the vampire-wolfgang and the overdressed Volturi (they swoop into the Pacific Northwest from Europe in ""Phantom of the Opera""-style black cloaks) is rough-and-tumble in a cheap highly CGI-enhanced way with ripped-off heads flying hither and thither. Its also something of a cheat but explaining that in detail would risk revealing too much of the ending. Needless to say the picture is also packed with inane clumsy dialogue though if the visuals measured up that wouldnt be such a liability This has always been a story best told with faces not words. But at this point Pattinson and Stewart just look exhausted ready to shed these characters forever. ""Breaking Dawn - Part 2"" includes some flashbacks culled from the first and perhaps best entry in the series Catherine Hardwickes 2008 ""Twilight"" which made no apology for its iPod-shuffle brand of romantic floridness - it was touchingly irony-free. In those flashbacks its astonishing to see how young and unjaded Pattinson and Stewart looked. At that point they were still giving the series their all; now perhaps partly because of the battering their personal lives have taken as the result of their own on-again off-again real-life romantic adventure they just look zonked. Its time at last for Bella and Edward to retire to the bedroom where they can get it on tirelessly for the rest of eternity unhindered by fans expectations and the sordidness of box office figures. What happens there is their own business. May they finally suck in peace.

Four years to the month since Twilight rocked the box office and turned Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson into scandal fodder the glowy gloopy Bella-Edward-Jacob love triangle comes to a close. And what better way to celebrate than by bounding through the Pacific Northwest mist leaping across treetops and scampering up cliffs stalking warm-blooded critters to feast on? A deer perhaps? How about a mountain lion? ""You need to get your thirst under control"" the loving husband Edward counsels his new bride - and ""newborn"" vampire - Bella. ""You need to hunt."" And so as Breaking Dawn - Part 2 begins thats what they do hurtling through the woods in a psychedelic whoosh of sound and color. Meanwhile back at the Architectural Digest-ready Cullen compound the couples beatific baby girl Renesmee (rhymes with resume) is getting oohed and awwed at by Edwards red-eyed clan. Little Renesmee a half-human half-vampire thing with wide-open and wonder-filled orbs grows before our very eyes. She is an anomaly in this vampire business and a rumor gets started - by Irina (Maggie Grace) one of the legion of attractive bloodsuckers with blond highlights and designer jeans who populate the Twilight universe - that the child is an ""immortal."" Poll Are you going to see the final Twilight movie? Yes I already have my tickets. Eventually No way. Id rather see one of the other great openings this weekend. This is not a good thing apparently. And so the Volturi a Tuscan coven of hooded vamps who behave like a Papal convocation decide to investigate. Enter Michael Sheen (doing the sketch-comedy routine ""Dr. Who Joins Spinal Tap"") and Dakota Fanning (glowering - and if Im not mistaken dialogue-less). But wait First there are softcore montages of entwined Stewart and Pattinson body parts (now that theyre married they discover this sex stuff is kind of cool). ""So beautiful"" he coos. ""And were the same temperature now."" And wait Theyve got to tell Bellas dad the town cop Charlie (Billy Burke) that his daughter isnt dead after all. Jacob (Taylor Lautner) the shape-shifting wolf boy with the mighty abs delivers the news. And then Jacob motorcycles back to Chez Cullen to tell Bella that he no longer aches and pines for her because hes made a magical Native American connection with her daughter ""Nessie."" Dont worry theres nothing pervy about it he assures her - and shell morph into an adult babe in seven short years anyway. All of which culminates in what is sure to be Stewarts Oscar-clinching moment ""You imprinted on my daughter??"" the actress exclaims adding in disbelief ""You nicknamed my daughter after the Loch Ness monster??""

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet From the start the Twilight film series has struggled with the dearth of external conflict presented in its source material. This isnt a problem for fans of Stephenie Meyers bestselling book series who can recall every thought and emotion behind the many many protracted stares exchanged between characters while those not indoctrinated into Meyers world are left to wonder why everyone in the film appears to be in constant gastrointestinal distress. The Twilight films have undertaken a difficult balancing act attempting to take the small-scale low-stakes emotional content that drives the majority of the book series and translate it into the sort of engaging action that drives a blockbuster movie franchise. The series preceding four entries have only been successful at doing so in fits and starts. Breaking Dawn--Part 2 comes as close as the film series has gotten to reconciling the epic romance its billed as and the self-aware camp-fest it often hints at wanting to be but its still a messy unwieldy slab of film product thats targeted directly at fans of the book series with little regard for anyone else. Picking up directly after the events of Breaking Dawn--Part 1 which ended with Kristen Stewarts Bella giving birth to a half-human/half-vampire baby before dying and being resurrected as a vampire Part 2 opens with Stewart acclimating to her new immortal life with her now-husband Edward (Robert Pattinson). This means lots of poorly rendered vampire gymnastics--this series has unfortunately never applied much of its considerable budgetary heft to its CGI--and candlelit romance in the Pottery Barn catalog the undead couple calls home. But it also means figuring out how to close the door on Stewarts human life and the people in it a significant predicament thats quickly waved away in a half-assed conversation that essentially amounts to ""Just go with it okay?"" Theres also the issue of the bond thats formed between Stewarts rapidly aging daughter and Stewarts former emotional play-toy Jacob (Taylor Lautner). The exceedingly awkward situation of a full-grown man-wolf being in everlasting inexplicable love with a child is handled with some actual wit allowing Stewart and Lautner to flex their comedic muscles as they engage with the soap-operatics. (Lautner gets to flex his substantial physical muscles as well specifically in a funny scene where he strips down in front of a horrified Billy Burke in order to exhibit his shape-shifting abilities for Stewarts perpetually in-the-dark father.) But like every other major conflict in the Twilight series its quickly shrugged off with a conciliatory sentence or two and everyone goes back to being even happier than they were before. That is until the evil vampire authority known as the Volturi get involved. Originally introduced in the series second film New Moon then mostly ignored in the following two installments the Volturi are especially interested in Stewart and Pattinsons offspring whom they incorrectly believe to be an ""immortal child"" their cultures ultimate taboo. The new parents and their peace-loving coven know they cant fight the looming black-becloaked force (fronted by Michael Sheen having the time of his life in a tremendously campy performance) so they decide to handle the issue as they do everything else by talking. This involves recruiting several sympathetic ""witnesses"" to their cause leading to the introduction of a dozen or so new very minor characters. Many of the newbies have their own convenient ""special gift"" a favorite plot contrivance of the Twilight series that allows for sidestepping major problems via mind-reading premonition mental persuasion or whatever other power is needed to hurdle the issue at hand. These special powers become the focus of a larger poorly explained threat posed by the Volturi leading to a tense snow-blanketed showdown between the two factions. In these concluding scenes the movie feints toward actual substance and consequence--and threatens to diverge from its rigid adherence to the book--before chickening out in spectacular baffling fashion. If nothing else director Bill Condon and screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg deserve credit for rendering the storys passive conclusion so epically but theyre ultimately beholden to the inert source text and its exacting fan base. If there were any doubts that Breaking Dawn--Part 2 like all of the Twilight films is meant foremost as a love letter to fans theyre put to rest with the presence of both a series-spanning montage and a video-yearbook-esque closing-credits sequence that lists every single character in the movies including ones who havent appeared since the first film. Moments like these combined with the series insistence on introducing and naming every single minor character no matter how insignificant suggest that the Twilight films were never intended to stand on their own terms--they serve as a visual extension of an established entity with a built-in fandom. That fandom will be thrilled to see their beloved characters happy endings in Breaking Dawn--Part 2 while everyone else will be left wondering why they were supposed to care about any of them in the first place.

Starring Robert Pattinson Kristen Stewart Taylor Lautner Director Bill Condon Release Opened Nov 16 2012  Editorial Review The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn - Part 2 By Michael OSullivanFriday Nov. 16 2012At the far end of the spectrum of potential audience for the ""Twilight"" franchise is the ""Twi-Hard"" contingent those fanatic loyalists to the book-turned-movie series who will camp out for a front-row seat no matter what the reviews say. Their only regret about ""The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn"" the two-part film whose final installment opens tonight bringing the five-chapter saga to an end is that the whole magical experience couldnt last forever. Alas all good things must come to an end. And some bad ones too. For those with no vested interest in this protracted and supernatural soap opera but who do care about cinema ""The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn -- Part 2"" will be unsurprisingly a silly and somewhat cheesily made waste of time. But this review isnt written for either of those two extremes. Rather its for the theoretical viewer in the middle the one who cares as much about good storytelling as about whether Bella the human ends up with Edward the vampire or Jacob the werewolf. Whether such a mythological filmgoer even exists -- and is not more fanciful than the pasty-faced bloodsuckers and buff fur balls who populate the tale -- is a question for another day. As ""Breaking Dawn -- Part 2"" opens our once-mortal heroine Bella (Kristen Stewart) has just given birth to a half-human half-vampire baby Renesmee with her new undead husband Edward (Robert Pattinson). To save her life which had been threatened by carrying such a monstrous if undeniably photogenic spawn Bella has been turned into a vampire through an injection of venom by her husband. Almost the entire first third of the movie is devoted to Bellas adjustment to her new life and unfamiliar powers her sudden thirst for blood; her superhuman speed and strength; her seemingly insatiable (if PG-13) sex drive; and the tricks she must learn in order to pass as human. Endless minutes are devoted to colored contact lenses (to mask her red eyes) an arm-wrestling contest with her vampire brother-in-law (Kellan Lutz) and scenes of Edward and Bella running through the picturesque Pacific Northwest woods on her first hunt which culminates in an al fresco picnic dinner of venison tartare. Once again the special effects are low grade relying heavily on old-fashioned camera blur and unconvincing wire work to convey a sense of quickness and acrobatic agility as Bella bounds from rock to tree to mountaintop. Its ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Vampire"" without the verve. Eventually the real story kicks in after word reaches the Volturi -- the vampire worlds governing elite -- that Renesmee may be whats known as an ""immortal child"" a vampire baby who grows up with the mental maturity and imperfect self-control of an infant. Immortal children are illegal since they cannot be trained to rein in their appetites which threatens to expose the carefully hidden vampire subculture to the rest of the world. As Aro the leader of the Volturi Michael Sheen is a rare delight smiling malevolently -- and at one point issuing an insane cackle thats worth the price of admission -- as he attempts to determine whether Edward and his family must be punished and Renesmee destroyed. It aint much but it passes for drama -- if by ""drama"" you mean a climactic showdown in a field of snow between the powerful berobed Volturi on the one side and a ragtag band of the ""good"" vampires now in league with Jacob and his pack of giant CGI werewolves on the other. Ill tell you one thing You have never seen so much unrealistic decapitation in your life. After about the 20th head-popping which flips off like the top of a soda bottle its just ridiculous. Not so funny? The relationship between the werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner) and Renesmee played by the adorable poppet Mackenzie Foy. As in the books Jacob Bellas former suitor has ""imprinted"" on the little girl a bit of lupine gobbledygook meaning that they are destined to become lovers when shes fully grown. I know I know Its fantasy. Its also more than a bit creepy smacking of the child bride. Fortunately Lautner brings a welcome sense of detachment from the films absurdities. ""Breaking Dawn"" which only every now and again seems to have figured out that its okay to laugh at itself could use a little more of the actors wry laid-back energy and a little less pomposity. As for Stewart and Pattinson once again he looks perpetually stoned and she as if she has just detected a bad smell -- coming off of her own underarms. Neither one has much range or makes much of an impression other than vague malaise. Then again neither one has to. They are both so indelibly associated with the roles of Bella and Edward at this point that it will take each of them at least another couple of films before they fully shake the connection with ""Twilight."" As for you dear reader the symptoms of our long national nightmare should begin to fade as youre heading out of the theater dissipating by the time you clear the concession stand.

(Andrew Cooper / Summit Entertainment)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Nov. 15 2012 (out of 4)Starring Kristen Stewart Robert Pattinson Taylor Lautner Michael Sheen and Billy Burke. Directed by Bill Condon. At GTA theatres. 115 minutes. PGThis is the way TheTwilightSaga ends not with a fang but a snicker.Breaking Dawn Part 2 the fifth and concluding chapter of the young vampire romance franchise manages to find a pulse as it profitably clicks the turnstiles one last time.PHOTOS Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn Part 2 London red carpetArticle Continued BelowIt does so not through the drama which is goofier than ever but through laughter some of which is actually intended.Perhaps to let us know that they get the joke or to atone for the previous eight hours of relentless earnestness returning director Bill Condon and screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg let their freak flags fly.So does Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) who awakens from the birthing emergency of Breaking Dawn Part 1 as a ""newborn"" vampire along with blood-red eyes immense strength and a powerful thirst.There are no second thoughts about having shucked off her humanity (""I was born to be a vampire"") as Bella proceeds to knock around anybody who gets in her way including her sad-sack bloodsucker hubby Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). Hes unable to stop her and barely able to guide her as she snacks on the mountain lion that caught her attention just before she sank her teeth into Bambi. The CGI is as cheesy as ever the dialogue still sucks Bellas dad Charlie (Billy Burke) is still clueless and the plot moves like a pensioners bowels but thankfully -- huzzah -- theres no more brooding Bella. In fact shes a hoot which gives the film the jolt of entertainment missing from the rest of the saga.Meanwhile back at the Cullen ranch theres a cradle containing their daughter Renesmee the half-human half-vampire child Bella bore after marrying pale Edward in the previous film. Renesmee is being jealously guarded by wolfman Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) who switches from mooning over Bella to hormonally ""imprinting"" upon her baby daughter in the most icky plot turn of author Stephenie Meyers weird and increasingly disturbing book series narrative.And while everybody sorts out their feelings about Jacobs pervy impulses a more urgent threat looms. The Italy-based Volturi an ancient vampire cult that enforces all the rules is getting its nibblers in a twist over Renesmees purported status as an illicit ""immortal child"" which apparently is as dangerous as giving Bart Simpson a slingshot in a glassware shop.Led by the campy Aro (Michael Sheen) who looks like hes auditioning for the lead role in a Michael Jackson tribute show the Volturi is fixing to come to the Pacific Northwest to administer summary justice to the Cullens and their pals.Heads are gonna roll -- and lawdy do they ever. There are more decapitations in Breaking Dawn Part 2 than youd find in a Barbie doll collection in a boys tree fort. (The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn Part 2 narrowly escapes R rating)Parents should take note of this but even non-Twihards should appreciate the final rumble the series best tussle between the goods vamps (the Cullens) the bad vamps (the Volturi) and the wolf clan (Jacobs hairy crew).Before that theres the usual plot larding. The Volturi bide their time as the Cullens travel the globe rounding up vampire ""witnesses"" to explain to Aro why Renesmee should be allowed to live.This looks for all the world like a vampire version of The Avengers because everybody has their own special super power. This includes one guy whom I cant remember if hes good or bad who emits a noxious odour as if hes been binging on bean burritos. Like Jumpin Jack Flash hes a gas gas gas.Adding further hilarity to the witnesses theres a pair of punk vampires who actually speak with a Dracula accent. They vant to suck your bloodAnd new guy Garrett (Lee Pace) emerges as a funky cat and history buff who has been personally present at every American war including the Battle of the Little Bighorn a.k.a. Custers Last Stand.""I came this close to biting Custer but the Indians got him first"" he deadpans.Maybe you had to be there. But its stuff like this that sends Twilight out on a relative high note and more than a sense of relief for any sane person who has sat through all five episodes -- with possibly more to come as Renesmee (played by Mackenzie Foy in her later years) grows into a rebellious teen (Betty and Veronica watch out)That ""forever"" tag on the movie posters?It should read ""finally.""MORE TWILIGHT NEWSTwilight Saga essentials A trivia quizFrom X-Men and Twilight to Halo Canadian actor makes mark in big franchisesThe Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn Part 2 narrowly escapes R ratingThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

I mean in these movies theres always a lot of standing and waiting and sitting and hoping -- for Edward the vampire (Robert Pattinson) to kiss human Bella (Kristen Stewart) for him to make transformative love to her for them to share the ""perfect piece of forever"" that Stephenie Meyer described in her quartet of books with the tummy-rubbing glee of someone about to spend eternity eating a pie. This fifth and mercifully final installment features so much idle anticipation that its unclear whether were watching a movie or an Apple product launch. The waiting concerns the decision of the Volturi (Vatican-style vampires) to destroy the computer-generated daughter Edward and Bella have spawned -- the spit-take-inducingly named Renesmee. Related Links Find showtimes and theaters Pictures Twilight Breaking Dawn -- Part 2 premieres Theres legitimate concern that as even half a vampire the child will cease aging and remain a toddler until the end of time throwing extra-strength civilization-ending tantrums. The dreaded historical era would be Renesmee the Most Terrible Two. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below In any case the entire movie which is based on the back half of Meyers final book builds up to the showdown starring almost every vampire in the series. The Volturi are lead by Michael Sheen who fared better in the second movie as a kind of white Queen in French Revolution gold. This time he and his dozens of minions -- one of whom thanklessly is Dakota Fanning -- wear black dusters with marching-band-uniform accents. If the Volturi werent able in the climactic brawl to heave Edward Bella and their small gang of allies across a clearing in Washington state I imagine they could simply glide-step them to death. ""Breaking Dawn--Part 2"" which Bill Condon directed and Melissa Rosenberg wrote scarcely featured a line of dialogue more than 140 characters or a shot that lasts longer than is required to say it. Even if youre Michael Sheen this isnt an actors movie. The computer-generated wolves give the best performances. The film does provide the sight of Stewart arm-wrestling the movies strongman (Kellan Lutz) whizzing around the forest and across rooms at top cheesiness and beating up Jacob (Taylor Lautner) a werewolf the other man who loves Bella and the surrogate mother/future lover of Bellas daughter. Its best not to ask. Nor is there any point in wondering about the international vampire cavalcade that travels to Washington in support of Renesmee. Those who dont know who these people are should feel free to rename them. I spied the Bruno Mars vampire a Bon Iver one Venus and Serena a Lady Gaga lots of My Chemical Romance and two aggressively styled European fellows I renamed Dolce amp; Gabbana. True commitment to the ""Breaking Dawn--Part 2"" franchise can be measured in how upset you are to see some of their heads ripped off. The screaming the night I saw it suggested ear-shattering devotion. There was also some laughter that suggested mild contempt. (Im not sure they made it out of the theater alive.) During one dewy montage I turned to comfort my weeping seatmate who had come to mourn The End. Later she texted me. ""Im confused"" she wrote. ""About?"" ""My feelings."" ""Are you sad its over?"" She was. But she was also sad for me and people like me. ""I believe [my feelings are] best expressed by Leona Lewiss Bleeding Love. "" "" I dont care what they say. Im in love with you ?"" I asked. ""Exactly."" "" They try to pull me away but they dont know the truth ?"" That was it. To further paraphrase the raw feeling of Miss Lewiss international smash hit This series has cut open my friend and her fellow so-called Twi-hards. They keep bleeding keep keep bleeding love.

"Review Breaking Dawn -- Part 2 is Twilight done right - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Breaking Dawn -- Part 2 is Twilight done rightBy Randy MyersContra Costa TimesPosted 11/15/2012 084727 AM PSTUpdated 11/15/2012 051101 PM PST In Theaters This Week Get showtimes watch movie trailers Opening Wednesday The Big Picture Life of Pi Life of Pi 3D Red Dawn Rise of the Guardians Rise of the Guardians 3D Interviews with the stars hot new trailers The sex scenes between Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart sizzle. The acting is a touch better. And for once a ""Twilight"" delivers slam-bang action and legitimate special effects.But what makes ""The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn -- Part 2"" superior to the four-pack of ""Twilight"" films that preceded it is its brand of campy humor and a satisfying twist near the end that readers of the books will find an improvement. At least the two I sat near thought so.Rather than repeat past mistakes by handling author Stephenie Meyers supernatural love story with kid gloves this ""Twilight"" cuts loose and is as playful as a puppy. It never takes itself seriously and that makes a world of difference. There are still issues -- length is one pacing another -- but this turns out to mostly be an unexpected success.At last director Bill Condon -- who helmed the goofy over-the-top ""Breaking Dawn -- Part 1"" -- and regular screen series scribe Melissa Rosenberg have come up with a winning ""Twilight"" formula one that respects the fan base while unfurling the welcome mat for open-minded nonfans. Its an approach that has stymied previous directors. Too bad it arrives at the table as dessert is being served.Regardless the refreshing approach to ""Breaking Dawn -- Part 2"" proves to be a needed departure invigorating the revered series final chapter and its beloved characters and actors as well. In the past Bella (Stewart) has been an annoying drip stringing along her bloodsucking soul mate Edward (Pattinson so sexy here) while flirting with her beastly he-boy Jacob (Taylor Lautner more at ease).Advertisement Not this time. As a newbie vampire she finally sheds her irritating tics and mumblecore speech patterns. Bellas new powers transform her into a bloodsucking Wonder Woman of sorts as she takes down buffed-out Jacob during an argument and one-ups cocky Emmett Cullen (Kellan Lutz). Stewart has a heyday with the changes giving her best most lively performance in the series. Robert Pattinson as Edward and Kristen Stewart as Bella star in the final installment of the Twilight Saga ""Breaking Dawn Part 2."" (Summitt) But Bellas not the only newborn with great powers. Renesmee (Mackenzie Foy) Bella and Edwards half-human/half-immortal daughter has special talents including growing up very quickly. She catches the unwanted attention of the Volturi the high-powered vampire coven led by Aro (Michael Sheen hamming it up and looking perfectly ridiculous in what resembles Janet Jacksons jacket from ""Rhythm Nation."") This of course sets the stage for a tense showdown with vampires and wolves squaring off against the small army of Volturi. The scene provides a satisfying dramatic flourish near the movies end and snugly puts a cap on the guilty-pleasure series. If only theyd uncorked that bubbly humor from the start.You can contact Randy Myers at rmyersbayareanewsgroup.com and follow him at Twitter.com/soitsrandy and at Facebook.com/BayAreaNewsGroup.RandyMyers.The Twilight SAGA Breaking Dawn -- Part 2    Rating PG-13 (for sequences of violence including disturbing images some sensuality and partial nudity)Cast Kristen Stewart Robert Pattinson Taylor Lautner Billy Burke Peter Facinelli Elizabeth Reaser Mackenzie Foy Dakota FanningDirector Bill CondonRunning time 1 hour 55 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Curb Your Enthusiasm The long wait for new episodes is almost overGame of Thrones Season 8 definitely the lastReview Holocaust haunts family in The Gathering Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

"Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn -- Part 2 movie review L.A Times - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Bella is on a tear in Twilight finale The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn Part 2 Movie review by Betsy Sharkey Betsy Sharkey reviews The Twilight Saga - Breaking Dawn Part 2 Betsy Sharkey reviews The Twilight Saga - Breaking Dawn Part 2 Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic From the moment Bella Swan blinks those blood-red eyes of a newborn vampire you just know that ""The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn -- Part 2"" is going to be vampirrific. Which is not quite the same as terrific but for the swooning series that made heartthrobs of Kristen Stewart Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner it just feels right.In its fifth and theoretically final film the mega movie monster spawned by novelist Stephenie Meyers phenomenon spends virtually all of its 115 minutes feeding the unquenchable thirst its fans have for all things ""Twilight."" To give ""BD2"" its due it is the best of the bunch and will be much loved by Twihards which should by no means be mistaken for praise. The movie has plenty of romance which is what first hooked the teen set. But it is a far more ferocious brand now that Bella (Stewart) can put all of her new vampire muscle into making sweet mush with dreamy undead hubby Edward Cullen (Pattinson). It also has ab-rrific werewolf Jacob Black (Lautner) baring his body as well as his soul -- prepare to hear screams when this happens. And there are sexy new bloodsuckers like Lee Paces Garrett (why oh why didnt they introduce him sooner?).PHOTOS Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn - Part 2 premiere The action is completely over the top warming up with arm wrestling and rock climbing then going in for the kill with a head-ripping body-burning battle that pits the Cullen clan against those world-dominating Volturi fashionably led by Aro (Michael Sheen as devilish as ever) with Jane (Dakota Fanning) delighted to handle the dirtiest dirty work.And -- this is an important one -- ""Breaking Dawn -- Part 2"" does not take itself too seriously. There are cheeky nods to the entire series throughout with the tendency toward campy excess becoming an ongoing punch line. There is more humor in general and our newly minted warrior princess is responsible for much of it.The film directed by Bill Condon and adapted by screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg who has been there from beginning picks up right where ""BD1"" left off so if youre new to the franchise you have a lot of catching up to do (""Twilight"" ""New Moon"" ""Eclipse"" ""Part 1"" whew).PHOTOS Fan camp / tent city for Twilight premiere Heres what you need to know Bella has given birth to the half-vampire/half-mortal wunderkind with the weird name Renesmee and has just recovered from Edwards life-changing bite. Jacob and Edward have joined forces or at least stopped fighting. The rest of the Cullens (Peter Facinelli Elizabeth Reaser Kellan Lutz Nikki Reed Jackson Rathbone and Ashley Greene) are thrilled with the way things are turning out. And Bellas dad Charlie Swan (Billy Burke) is still in the dark.As ""BD2"" opens we see the world as Bella does now. Since vampire sight is really really sharp it gives cinematographer Guillermo Navarro a chance for a lot of Nat-Geo-style close-ups of the flora and fauna (a.k.a. food Bambi beware). Bella wants to see her new baby but theres a matter of that deadly thirst so first she must feed. A race through the forest at warp speed shows off only one of many new powers that Bella has picked up. Her ability to create a mind shield -- critical when the Volturi battle begins -- looks like a CGI-lite heat wave that would barely make Aro break a sweat but hey it seems to work.At the center of the controversy that drives ""BD2"" is Bella and Edwards fast-growing sprite (nicely played by young Mackenzie Foy once the filmmakers get past the creepy CGI versions of her baby days). Immortal children (Renesmee isnt one but Aro isnt convinced) are a major vampire no-no; lets just say their terrible 2s are truly terrible. Meanwhile Jacobs werewolf genes have kicked in and hes imprinted on Renesmee which means shes destined to be his soul mate when she grows up -- at the current rate that should be in a couple of months.PHOTOS RPattz and KStew through the yearsReally thats about it except for all the battle rounds pre midst of and post.The battle is epic and quite the spectacle. It is exceptional in its staging although considering the number of vampires who give their life for the cause youll be grateful they dont bleed. According to ""Twilight"" lore death requires heads be brutally ripped off. Stakes through the heart definitely will not suffice. The dialogue remains spotty and sappy the effects still havent caught up to modern-day standards but ""Twilights"" popularity is such that even when it falls short it doesnt seem to matter. Condon who is usually attached to higher-brow projects -- ""Kinsey"" ""Gods and Monsters"" ""Dreamgirls"" -- was first brought in to class things up for ""BD1."" Although he seems to have let down his guard and had more fun with ""Twilight"" the second time around the filmmakers greatest challenge was not so much creative but ensuring he did nothing to damage the golden goose.Under his direction the acting of the sagas all-important threesome has gotten more polished. If you doubt that the films flashbacks will remind just how awkward the earlier outings were. There is also Edward and Jacobs massive sex appeal and their impossibly romantic notions about love roughly drawn from the Victorian era. But Bella has always been the belle of this ball. In ""Breaking Dawn -- Part 2"" Stewart is even more luminous in holding the screen breathing vibrant new life into her undead beauty queen. Shes gotten better working in the ""Twilight"" zone elevating each new chapter as it comes along. It almost makes you regret that this is the swan song.---------------------------------The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn -- Part 2MPAA rating PG-13 for sequences of violence including disturbing images some sensuality and partial nudityRunning time 1 hour 55 minutesPlaying In general releasebetsy.sharkeylatimes.com PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Condon who is usually attached to higher brow projects  -- ""Kinsey"" ""Gods and Monsters"" ""Dreamgirls"" -- was first brought in to class things up for ""BD1.""Although he seems to have let down his guard and had more fun with ""Twilight"" the second time around the filmmakers greatest challenge was not so much creative but ensuring he did nothing to damage the golden goose.Under his direction the acting of the sagas all-important threesome has gotten more polished.

Photo Doane Gregory Kristen Stewart in the final installment of the Twilight series. (Andrew Cooper SMPSP (c) 2011 Summit Entertainment) The anemic Bella gets a much needed transfusion in the cheerfully hammy final chapter of this teen saga. After spending the past four films being toted around by her two chest-thumping paramours like some sort of monster-boy accessory its mighty heartening to see Bella (Kristen Stewart) finally stand on her own two feet. Thanks to her conversion at the end of ""Breaking Dawn - Part 1"" to immortality she now has the same superpowers as Edward (Robert Pattinson) her pasty brooding soul mate. If only the whole movie was devoted to Bellas new lifestyle of arm-wrestling careening through the air and tearing apart wildlife per her ""vegetarian"" vamp diet. Sure its hokey -- the watchword of this whole series --but fun. Especially watching Edward wince and whine as she grabs him lustfully ""Its your turn not to break me."" (Cue the sighs of a million Twihards remembering this summers gossip-mag covers. Yes they actually did boo KStew during the opening credits) But theres half an enormous books worth of plot to get to so we move on to the central concern Bella and Edwards half-immortal baby daughter the problematically named Renesmee has been misidentified as entirely a vampire apparently a big transgression with the Volturi. This Italian governing body of the undead headed by the howlingly campy Michael Sheen as leader Aro is set on doing her in. And so the Cullen clan (Peter Facinelli Elizabeth Reaser Nikki Reed Kellan Lutz Ashley Greene Jackson Rathbone) must take a break from their usual routine of leaning blankly against the walls of their Goth Pottery Barn house in the woods and get busy recruiting undead friends and relatives to bear witness to their cause. They hail from the far East and the Amazon from Alaska and from Ireland; one standout Lee Paces amusing bohemian vamp Garrett is found feasting on a second-rate street musician in a back alley (""I hated the first British invasion and I hate this one even more""). Another two Vladimir and Stefan (Guri Weinberg and Noel Fisher) have flown directly in from Transylvania judging by their eyerolling Dracula accents. And then theres Jacob (Taylor Lautner) Bellas long-suffering also-ran werewolf pal who has ""imprinted"" on Renesmee. This means he explains that hes identified her as his soul mate despite her being an infant (and despite the fact that hes spent the past four films mooning over her mom). ""Its a wolf thing"" he pleads as Bella throws him across the lawn repeatedly. (Long time coming buddy. Long time coming.) Billy Burke as Bellas rumpled dad Charlie is always a welcome sight too -- especially given his mostly natural coloring and seemingly actual hair. (Over the course of these movies the sodden wigs and the troweled-on makeup have increased exponentially; most of the other actors now look as if theyre in some sort of supernatural telenovela.) As it so often does in these books the action all comes down to a faceoff on a snowy Pacific Northwest field. But director Bill Condon clearly decided to go for broke with this one which veers abruptly and delightfully into full-on campy horror movie. Finally someone took the source material at its terribly written word and stopped treating the whole affair so seriously. It wouldnt be fair to go into much detail about the way things shake out but suffice to say Italian baddies like brother and sister Jane and Alec (Dakota Fanning and Cameron Bright) are given the sort of treatment fans will likely be cheering for and Condon departs enough from the plot of the book that Twihards will have a few surprises in store rather than just waiting to hear all the relevant lines doled out. Theyll still be a little sad to see this silly series wrap up as am I. Over the past four years this much-maligned franchise has certainly descended to B-movie lows but its also been partly responsible for spawning one of the fastest-growing movie demographics out there the rabid fangirl. And shes only going to get hungrier. sstewartnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next 5 ways to bring the Twilight saga back for more Read Next 5 ways to bring the Twilight saga back for more Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 44527 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 21107 16 feared dead in Texas hot air balloon crash 17704 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

RELATED NEWS Catching up on Twilight Best Twilight soundtrack songs 11/15 Marathon counts down to the Twilight finale Twilight the best moments from each film RELATED VIDEO Kristen Stewart Still Feeling Guilt for Cheating Twilight Stars Hit London for Final Premiere By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Mon Nov 19 2012 911 AM If you believe that patience is rewarded ""The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn -- Part 2"" is the movie for you. The franchise based on the wildly popular books by Stephenie Meyer concludes with a genuinely stirring ending. The problem is that you have to sit through four and three-quarters movies to get there. And actually the stirring part isnt the real ending. Theres a kind of greatest-hits montage tacked on at the end that packs all the emotional wallop of one of those very special ""Full House"" episodes when they came up with excuses for a clip show. Director Bill Condon (""Gods and Monsters"") is back for his second film in the series and if nothing else proves willing to take some chances. Cryptic enough for you? But back to the start. When last we saw Bella (Kristen Stewart) she had just been turned into a vampire by her husband Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) to prevent her from dying during childbirth. Now shes a full-on bloodsucker strong hyper-alert and ravenous. In the first four films Stewarts acting was deader than the undead who surrounded her; she played Bella like she thought she had the lead role in a zombie movie not a vampire one. Now that she is a vampire she is a little livelier. Thats a welcome change. But her acting hasnt improved and the dialogue remains laughable. Bad actress bad lines. Bad combination. Things appear to be going swimmingly in the Cullen household. The extended family enjoys caring for Edward and Bellas baby Renesmee (Mackenzie Foy) though everyone is a little worried that she grows about a foot a day. Jacob (Taylor Lautner) the werewolf who once was a rival with Edward for Bellas affections is still hanging around since he ""imprinted"" on Renesmee when she was born. (""Its not what you think"" he assures Bella and were like dude youve said too much already.) Things are awkward between Bella and her dad (Billy Burke the rare actor with a sense of humor here) but it looks like it will all work out. But then Renesmee is mistaken for an Immortal Child savage little creatures who spend their temper tantrums slaughtering villages and such instead of throwing sippie cups. This wont be allowed by the Volturi the creepy vampire bunch we first met in ""New Moon"" that evidently sets all the rules. The Cullen clan doesnt want to fight so they travel the world looking for fellow vampires who will vouch for Renesmee being half-human to avoid ... well it wouldnt be bloodshed because these are vampires fighting vampires. Hmm. Avoid a big fight I guess. Several international vampires and a few werewolves congregate at the Cullens hip cabin in the woods in Forks Wash. preparing for the worst. This means honing their gifts which are so random it plays like a Pokemon cartoon. Finally the showdown arrives which is a good thing because it means we get to see a lot of Michael Sheen the best actor in this series by an order of magnitude. He plays Aro the leader of the Volturi with glorious camp. Condon and screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg arent afraid to play fast and loose with Meyers story and thats a good thing. You just wish theyd done it more often. Despite a strong almost-ending the popularity of the ""Twilight"" series ends up being more a cult of personality built around the actors (and the tabloid romance between Pattinson and Stewart). They havent added anything to cinematic culture beyond securing a place in the tween pantheon of Things to Scream About. After a syrupy conclusion Condon gives a nice nod to fans scrolling through the actors who have appeared in the series leading up to you-know-who. (For the record at my screening Lautner got the most cheers Pattinson slightly less; when Stewarts face appeared the audience laughed.) Ultimately ""The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn -- Part 2"" is probably the best ending we could have hoped for in that it isnt great by any means but as anyone who saw the films that came before it can attest it could have been a lot worse. > Join the DiscussionView/Add Comments  >> Posting a comment to our website allows you to join in on the conversation.

(Doane Gregory/Summit Entertainment) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday November 14 2012 1132 PM Title The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn Part 2 Film Info With Kristen Stewart Robert Pattinson. The epic series concludes with a vampire showdown. Director Bill Condon (155). PG-13 Sexuality violence. Like its once-hesitant heroine Stephenie Meyers ""Twilight"" series has grown ever more confident over the last four years. (A span that surely feels like decades to spotlit stars Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson.) And now just as Bella Swan (Stewart) embraces her own eternal power ""Breaking Dawn Part 2"" expands with a full intensity of force stronger and more epic than the films that led to this impactful finale. RELATED UNITED KRISTEN STEWART ROBERT PATTINSON LOOK STUNNING AT PREMIERE Make no mistake those who havent yet bought into Meyers saga either in print or on screen are likely to remain unimpressed. But fans whove followed the Cullen clan faithfully deserve a satisfying finish and thats what director Bill Condon and screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg deliver. At the close of ""Breaking Dawn Part I"" we left Bella and her beloved Edward (Robert Pattinson) upon the arrival of their child Renesmee. This was no ordinary birth Bella nearly died and was rescued when Edward reluctantly turned her into a vampire. Also there was that (still creepy) imprinting thing wherein the lupine Jacob (Taylor Lautner) discovered that Bellas daughter was meant to be his life mate. Much to everyones surprise Renesmee (Mackenzie Foy) turns out to be half human and half-vampire. Near the start of ""Part 2"" corrupt Volturi leaders Aro (Michael Sheen) and Jane (Dakota Fanning) learn of her unusual abilities and become convinced shes a threat. While the Volturi prepare to confront Bella and Edward the Cullens (including Peter Facinelli Elizabeth Reaser and Kellan Lutz) span the globe looking for help. As the clairvoyant Alice (Ashley Greene) warns a fight is coming and they will need an army to protect themselves. This is not a series that appreciates subtlety so the more everyone embraces its over-the-top outrageousness the more fun we can all have. Sheen chews the scenery like a man whos never been fed; an always-amusing Lautner keeps things real (while losing his shirt within the first few minutes); and the intense well-staged finale delivers on its promise -- with a clever kicker that strays boldly from Meyers novel. (One must ask though are these cheesy computer effects really the best a billion-dollar franchise could buy?) Most important Bella finally comes into her own rejecting the pouty passivity that has been such a hallmark of her character. Neither Stewart nor Pattinson has shown great range in the sequels but their characters shift in interesting ways here. Bella saves herself -- and many others -- this time around and Edward like us can only look on in amazement. Finally shes been transformed into a heroine worthy of the immortality these films will give her.

Im Team Bill Condon. The gifted director behind ""Dreamgirls"" and ""Kinsey"" and ""Gods and Monsters"" is too talented by leagues for this material yet hes never suffused either of the ""Breaking Dawn"" movies with even a drop of condescension. Also read Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn - Part 2 Premiere Kristen Stewart Robert Pattinson Raise the Heat (Photos) Instead hes dug in with all of his silk-purse-making skill injecting wit and style whenever possible giving fans of the series more than they knew they wanted while valiantly creating entertainment for non-believers. Tellingly its when Condon and screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg veer away from Stephenie Meyers turgid text that ""The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn Part 2"" actually comes to life and turns into something bold and outrageous that will thrill both detractors and (if the fan-packed preview audience with whom I saw the movie is any indication) Twi-hards alike. Their naughty deviation from canon ends far too soon but its a daring gambit that almost validates the existence of the whole franchise. Also read Twilight Fans Camp Out Days Ahead of Final Breaking Dawn Premiere This latest and final chapter picks right up where ""Breaking Dawn Part 1"" left off with Bella (Kristen Stewart) newly converted to an immortal bloodsucker by her vampire husband Edward (Robert Pattinson) after she nearly died giving birth to their half-human child Renesmee. Meanwhile her lycanthrope ex Jacob (Taylor Lautner) has ""imprinted"" on the infant becoming her sworn protector and eventually we are to assume her mate. (Thankfully we get one scene in which Bella like those of us in the audience who havent swallowed Meyers mythos finds this repellent but soon she too is on board.) Everything seems comfy and cozy with Bella learning to control her thirst for blood and figuring out how to fake humanity around her charmingly clueless dad (Billy Burke) but soon the Volturi those Eurotrash buttinskis find out about Renesmee and theyre on the warpath. Also read How Twilight Made the Movie Business Respect Girl Power Seems there used to be something called ""immortal children"" kids who were converted to vampirism while they were too young to learn how to keep their bloodlust in check so the Volturi had to kill off not only the monster babies but also the covens who sheltered them. Renesmee is something else entirely but try telling that to a cackling Michael Sheen. With the cloaked Volturi making their way to Forks Wash. the Cullen clan spans the planet and pulls together a team of ghoulish Global Guardians who will stand with Renesmee against her would-be oppressors with immortals from Egypt Ireland the Amazon and New Orleans preparing for the eventual Gunfight at the Type O Corral. ""Breaking Dawn Part 2"" mostly stays close to the source material so rest assured nothing gets in the way of Bella being the Most Awesome Girl Ever; she adapts to her vampire life quicker than most bests even the strongest Cullen at arm-wrestling develops her other psychic powers and even finds time to read bedtime stories to her rapidly-growing child. (Now we know why soap-opera children magically transform overnight from squalling infant to precocious moppet -- theyre half-vamp.) The new aspects of Bella actually pull Stewart out of her lip-biting hair-twirling thousand-yard-stare mode of acting; ""feral"" and ""maternal"" wind up being the most interesting colors in her monochromatic paintbox. As for Pattinson now that Edward has won the girl hes mostly stuck being set dressing. Among the new vamps Lee Pace (as a Revolutionary War veteran) and Rami Malek (last seen in ""The Master"") stand out although the movie does its best to give all these new supporting players at least a moment or two to shine. Credit Condon with putting these cardboard characters and their loony dilemmas into a rich atmosphere; whether were running through the woods with those ridiculous wolves or following Bella through a lit-for-Christmas Seattle the director and cinematographer Guillermo Navarro (""Pans Labyrinth"") give the wintry settings a palpable sense of chilly foreboding. The director also caps things off with what amounts to a high-school yearbook for the whole ""Twilight"" series and the clips from the earlier movies remind us that this franchise is ending on substantially stronger footing than where it started whether or not you ever thought this was a path worth following.

Anyone who has seen even one of the previous cinematic installments of Stephenie Meyers endlessly protracted cross-species love story basically knows what to expect here and the multitudes who have seen them all will jam theaters the world over in the coming weeks to experience the  consummation so devoutly to be wished the ultimate and imperishable union of Bella Swan and Edward Cullen. The 1 billion generated by the first four entries in the U.S. and 2.5 billion generated worldwide will be increased considerably by the time Breaking Dawn finally reaches its dusk. PHOTOS Twilight Breaking Dawn -- Part 2 First Look at the Final Film in the Vampire Saga Shot by director Bill Condon concurrently with Breaking Dawn -- Part 1 over six months in 2010-11 Part 2 picks up right where its predecessor left off. Having given birth Kristen Stewarts Bella awakens with her new vampire eyes and immeasurably jacked-up strength and perceptions. Taken on a run in the woods by her husband Robert Pattinsons Edward she delights in her sudden speed unbridled energy and inhuman powers. Advised by Edward that ""We need to get your thirst under control"" Bella amusingly exhibits a craving for a vulnerable mountain climber but settles for the blood of a mountain lion of all things as her first meal on her new restricted diet. And once she gets a sample of vampire sex -- unlimited endurance off-the-charts intensity no need for sleep -- shes totally sold on her new life. ""I was born to be a vampire"" she contentedly proclaims. However there are those who would view Bellas baby Renesmee much as most people saw Mia Farrows spawn in Rosemarys Baby as a threat an ""immortal child"" whose lack of self-control could reveal vampires to humans. These spoilsports are the imperious members of the Volturi the ancient Italy-based aristocrats and self-appointed arbiters of vampiredom. Alerted to the great danger posed by this intolerable case of miscegenation the Volturi led by the preening Aro (Michael Sheen in the series most entertaining performance) make haste for the snowy wastes of the Pacific Northwest for the ultimate showdown. One of the distinguishing factors of the whole Twilight Saga has been its unerring ability to prevent four directors of variable talent from demonstrating any real cinematic flair. The prevailing approach in the many romantic interludes has been one of moony dourness in which the yearning and romantic platitudes that dominate novelist Meyers prose have been faithfully rendered while the action/combat scenes concentrate more on vampire and werewolf speed as well as abrupt relatively bloodless deaths than on creative representations of violence. PHOTOS Twilight Breaking Dawn - Part 2 Premiere Kristen Stewart Robert Pattinson Taylor Lautner Celebrate Final Film Although the new film builds to a massive confrontation on a wintry field between more than two dozen vampires backed up by their hirsute werewolf allies and the more numerous and gifted Volturi this remains the rare popular series without any great set pieces or even memorable scenes; from the beginning it all has just sort of chugged along in a stylistically mundane way that has not infrequently slipped over into dullness. And yet this has been an astonishingly successful series the repository of coursing emotions for countless teenage girls and evidently others as well. This was amply on display at the Los Angeles premiere of the film at the 7100-seat Nokia Theatre where peals of screeching and screaming greeted the appearance of every name on the opening credits from all the castmembers to the production designer and executive producers. Granted it was a radio promotion-heavy crowd but the exuberant reaction of the Twihards was testimony enough as to the heavy-breathing enthusiasm the series has generated a phenomenon that will continue for a few more months until conclusively taking its place in history as a series most remembered for its extraordinary financial success as well as for the on- and offscreen romance between its two beautiful leading actors that sustained with one embarrassing hiccup throughout its five years of existence. As for this last installment -- for which as was the case with the Harry Potter series the final novel was split in two to double the money -- the first hour is devoted to Bellas period of adjustment the rapid growth of her lovely daughter (played by 10-year-old Mackenzie Foy) the latters cautious introduction to Bellas in-the-dark father (Billy Burke) and the rounding up of far-flung allies who will try to help convince the Volturi that little Renesmee represents nothing to worry about. PHOTOS The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn -- Part 2 New Character Posters Revealed The second half sees the gathering storm come to a head in a test of inhuman powers that makes you wonder whether the MPAA was looking the other way when it handed out a PG-13 rating. Everyone in the cast gets into the act but Ashley Greenes Alice Cullen gets some special moments in the spotlight as she facilitates a neat plot twist as an intermediary with Aro. Taylor Lautner gets to take off his shirt one last time as the now-reconciled Jacob Black while a returning Dakota Fanning as a key Volturi again proves that in acting the eyes have it. The end credits feature the very nice touch of presenting a visual parade of all the actors who have played any kind of significant role in the entire series building from the smallest bit players to Pattinson and Stewart at the end. They acquit themselves here just as they have throughout the saga which has captured the peak of their youthful beauty. Now its time for them and the audience to move on.

Laughter disbelief and a sort of horrified exhilaration are all perfectly sane reactions to ""The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn -- Part 2"" a doozy of a finale to a series that until now has largely taken its dramatic cues from its maddeningly inert heroine. Not anymore With Bella reborn as a bloodthirsty butt-kicking vampire mama this second of two Bill Condon-directed installments clears a low bar to stand easily as the franchises most eventful and exciting entry. Admittedly much of the credit should go to a jaw-dropping extended climax that will give fans something to chew on besides the delicate matter of Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinsons offscreen romance -- not that a movie this commercially invincible requires too many talking points. As demonstrated by last years ""Harry Potter"" capper the conclusion to a book-based fantasy phenomenon can be counted on to do even bigger biz than usual and ""Breaking Dawn -- Part 2"" the fifth and final film in a property that has already grossed 2.5 billion worldwide should prove no exception. Summit can expect plenty of repeat attendance and itll be interesting to monitor reactions beyond author Stephenie Meyers distaff fanbase this being perhaps the first ""Twilight"" picture that some men in the audience might find themselves actually enjoying. Transformed into a vampire by the Cullen family at the end of ""Part 1"" so as to avoid near-certain death in childbirth Bella (Stewart) opens her cold red eyes on a strange new world. Now possessed of superhuman strength speed and senses she can sprint fly disembowel large mammals and even overpower her hulking vampire brother-in-law Emmett (Kellan Lutz). Best of all she and her husband Edward (Pattinson) can retire to their Thomas Kinkade-style cottage and enjoy a life of uninhibited carnal pleasure as demonstrated in a borderline-explicit love scene notable for its cloying soft-rock accompaniment amber-lit closeups and artful methods of vampire junk concealment. But Bella 2.0 also has her disadvantages namely a nagging thirst for human blood that results in some mild complications with her dad Charlie (Billy Burke) as well as with her rapidly developing half-mortal half-immortal daughter Renesmee (Mackenzie Foy). In a twist of fate that really brings out Bellas aggressive side Renesmees destiny turns out to be intertwined with that of Jacob (Taylor Lautner) the abdominally superior teenage werewolf who once rivaled Edward for Bellas affections. The considerable humor with which Condon and scribe Melissa Rosenberg tackle these developments has a disarming even invigorating effect on the proceedings; on occasion the film skirts so close to self-parody (the context in which Lautners Jacob loses his shirt gets a laugh as well as the usual screams and swoons) that it stops just short of expressing contempt for its audience. Its a nervy approach and also the right one grasping the intrinsic entertainment value of material that has never begged to be taken too seriously. Yet things do turn serious gravely so once Renesmees existence draws the attention of the Volturi the Italy-based vampire clan that has posed a dormant threat to the Cullens since the events of ""New Moon."" And so ""Breaking Dawn -- Part 2"" builds to its most audacious stroke a lengthy showdown that as already teased for months on Internet message boards at once subverts and honors the outcome of Meyers source novel. In the context of a series whose pleasures have always been predicated on delayed gratification this howlingly effective sequence can be viewed as a climax to roughly nine hours worth of foreplay. Even uncommitted viewers who have begrudgingly followed the movies up to this point will find themselves jolted awake so unsparing and frankly mesmerizing is the pictures stealth attack on audience sensibilities. However auds wind up feeling about the denouement there can be no denying that Condon in fully embracing his genre-filmmaking roots and not being afraid to go a little nuts in the process has succeeded in drawing real blood from the franchise at last (while staying just barely within bounds of a PG-13 rating). Playing to the storys cinematic strengths rather than its literary limitations the helmer stages a coup that gives the picture the feel of something more vital than just a perfunctory sendoff. Even before that point however ""Part 2"" has the bonus of a livelier Stewart performance than fans have been accustomed to. No longer a mopey lower-lip-biting emo girl this Bella is twitchy feral formidable and fully energized a goddess even among her exalted bloodsucker brethren. With the tedious Edward/Jacob drama now settled Pattinson and Lautner are largely decorative presences here giving some of the ensembles supporting players room to shine. As Aro the devious leader of the Volturi Michael Sheen offers another exquisitely controlled study in courtly malevolence while Burke as the ever-quizzical Charlie can do more with a raised eyebrow than most of his younger co-stars manage with whole mouthfuls of exposition. Casey LaBow Lee Pace and Rami Malek make strong impressions among the influx of actors donning pale makeup and red contact lenses to play the Cullens vampire allies. The integration of CG and live-action never one of the series strong suits shows some improvement in the visual design of Jacobs dependable wolf pack. Yet the f/x work reaches a nadir in the rendering of Renesmee played by bright 10-year-old actress Foy her features digitally tailored to suit the characters many different ages. The result resembles a PhotoShop experiment gone wrong especially during the childs infant stage; Renesmee is supposed to be an otherworldly being but that doesnt mean she should evoke Marlon Wayans in ""Little Man."" D.p. Guillermo Navarros lush establishing shots of the Pacific Northwest (interiors were largely filmed in Louisiana) Virginia Katz and Ian Slaters propulsive editing and Richard Shermans woodland-chic production design demonstrate just how far ""The Twilight Saga"" has come at least on a technical level from the rough indie aesthetic of Catherine Hardwickes original ""Twilight"" four years ago. A lengthy roll call singling out cast members across all five pics ends things on a classy note.
