By Peter Rainer Film critic January 21 2011 Save for later Saved Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Writer-director Richard Levines ""Every Day"" is like a gumbo of fantastic ingredients where nothing ever really coalesces. The fine cast includes Liev Schreiber as Ned a writer for a successful ""Nick/Tuck""-like TV show; Helen Hunt as Jeannie his put-upon wife; Brian Dennehy as her surly sickly father who comes to live with them; and Carla Gugino as Neds brazenly seductive writing partner.There are sharp moments throughout Neds disgust at having to churn out lowest-denominator TV material; the love-hate back-and-forth between Jeannie and her father; a few scenes between Ned and his oldest son Jonah (Ezra Miller) who is openly gay. But too often the sequences in this movie play out like snatches from a terrific play that somehow got lost along the way.

"Every Day review Coddled characters make it difficult for us to feel their pain |       NJ.com comments Every Day review Coddled characters make it difficult for us to feel their pain Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on January 14 2011 at 803 AM View/Post Comments Liev Schreiber Ezra Miller Skyler Fortgang and Helen Hunt in ""Every Day."" Theyre part of the ""sandwich generation"" -- 40-something adults who attend to their aging parents at the same time theyre raising their own children. Appointments with tutors and gerontologists trips to colleges and nursing homes -- obligations press in from both sides. Thats the place Liev Schreiber and Helen Hunt find themselves in ""Every Day."" Its a recognizable situation that should be easy to sympathize with. Yet the movie makes it hard for most of us to recognize ourselves in this couple or sympathize with their struggles. Part of it is that these people are simply too privileged. Hunt doesnt seem to have a job; Schreiber is so overpaid that the prospect of spending 40000 a year on an old-age home brings only a wince. Theyre under emotional stress certainly but their money gives them breathing space many couples cant even imagine. Part of it too is that Schreibers character is a bit of a jerk. He works (not very hard) writing trashy scripts for a TV hospital drama; when his home life gets a little dicey he responds by retreating emotionally and having an affair with a hot (and even richer) co-worker while his wife stays home cleaning up vomit. Perhaps the material is simply too close to writer/director Richard Levine (who was a writer and director on TVs ""Nip/Tuck"" and admits that some of the elements here are autobiographical). He sees so much of himself in these characters that hes blind to what we might see or how difficult it might be for us to empathize. The acting at least is very good -- mostly. Helen Hunt slouches through everything with the same slightly pained expression shes worn since ""Mad About You"" (does the woman always have a headache?). But Schreiber is excellent as always and his scenes with his boss -- a proudly crass Eddie Izzard -- have the snap of real satire. Fine too is Brian Dennehy as Schreibers failing father-in-law a brooding bear of a man who is not only determined not to go gently into that good night but resolved to go as loudly as possible. Its a good part -- mostly because it makes no excuses for the character. Unfortunately thats not true of the other people on-screen -- or of a screenplay that sometimes twists itself into knots in order to construct a conflict. (Schreiber and Hunt have all this money and they dont have a guest room to put Dennehy in? Or the ability to hire someone to help with his care?) Carla Gugino adds some appeal as a sexy TV scribe. But you have to wonder if the director really read the words he wrote for one of Guginos scenes in which the writers sit around and debate whether a character is ""relatable."" Because these characters arent. Ratings note The film contains strong language substance abuse sexual situations and brief violence. Every Day (R) Image Entertainment (93 min.) Directed by Richard Levine. With Liev Schreiber Helen Hunt Brian Dennehy. Now playing exclusively at the Beekman Theatre in New York.

(IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT) Elizabeth Weitzman Friday January 14 2011 400 AM Title Every Day Family drama about a Queens couple pulled apart by increasing responsibilities. With Liev Schreiber Helen Hunt Brian Dennehy. Director Richard Levine (133). R Language sexuality drugs. At the Beekman.Its the details that make Richard Levines perceptive debut stand out a burnt dinner a demoralizing meeting at work the stressful rush to school in the morning.Alas Levine -- formerly a writer and executive producer on ""Nip/Tuck"" -- is not yet confident enough to trust in those minor notes alone.But he should be ""Every Day"" is duly titled and fails only when it trades recognizable realities for movie-ready fantasy.Most adults will find something familiar in the daily frustrations faced by middle-class Queens residents Ned (Liev Schreiber) and Jeannie (Helen Hunt). He spends his time writing scripts for a demanding and ungrateful boss (Eddie Izzard) at a ""Nip/Tuck""-like cable drama. She spends hers caring for a demanding and ungrateful father (Brian Dennehy) in their home.Though the deep connection between Ned and Jeannie remains evident to us the demands of work illness and child care pile up so high neither spouse can see the other.As their responsibilities become increasingly exhausting each tries to find a life raft to cling to. Jeannie focuses on her sons inquisitive preteen Ethan (Skyler Fortgang) and Jonah (Ezra Miller) a gay high school senior. Meanwhile Ned gets drawn into the flirtations of a sexy co-worker (Carla Gugino) whos got her own complicated secrets.Levine displays a sensitive directorial touch and draws warmly genuine performances from all his actors. But as with so many first-time filmmakers he lacks the perspective to assess his own screenplay.There are too many overwritten moments designed solely to make the movie more interesting -- when in fact they undercut the low-key relatability that serves as its strongest asset.Izzard feels particularly out of place as a blithely amoral producer who pushes Ned to include more incest and cannibalism in his scripts.The films carefully timed conclusion is also regrettable. Real life isnt choreographed for maximum impact its messy and unpredictable. At its best so is ""Every Day.""

Ned is stressed out by the demands of writing for a trashy TV show that boasts five shocking moments per script. Meanwhile the purring of a seductive colleague (Carla Gugino) promises a more colorful life than the one that awaits him at home where his teen son is gay and his wife (Helen Hunt) is frustrated by the bodily malfunctions of her live-in dad (Brian Dennehy). Written by ""Nip/Tuck"" vet Richard Levine ""Every Day"" seems to think its being out-there and funny as when Dennehys suicidal grump describes whats going on in his underwear that shouldnt be or the teen son starts sneaking off on dates with an older boy during which nothing much happens. All three of the principal characters are irritating even thanks to Hunts wounded monotone the blameless wife. At times the movie seems stuck in a loop of scenes that closely resemble earlier ones. A 42-minute TV soap has more story than this limp and familiar tale of domestic woe.

"Movie review Every Day - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Open SpaceMovie review Every DayHelen Hunt and Live Schreiber are a midlife couple coping with family issues and marital problems much like a lot of people in the real world.January 14 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic ""Every Day"" starring Liev Schreiber and Helen Hunt is an intimate often uncomfortable sometimes whimsical look at a sandwich marriage a those midlife couples caught between growing kids and aging parents with no time for themselves. So a comedy of manners this is not. Instead writer-director Richard Levine ( ""Nip/Tuck"") is concerned with lives derailed by ordinary events. Schreibers Ned is the center of this crumbling universe and the one being buried by the weight of his world. His teenage son (Ezra Miller) is gay and just finding his footing at the same time his ailing father-in-law ( Brian Dennehy) is moving in and his frustrated wife (Hunt) is barely coping. Ned also is dealing with a juicy co-worker ( Carla Gugino) who is flirting and a crazy boss ( Eddie Izzard) whos never satisfied. What makes this intriguing yet woefully uneven film so relatable is that there is nothing about Neds experience that seems extreme. Thoreaus ""lives of quiet desperation"" line comes to mind. The unraveling officially begins with the arrival of Dennehys Ernie a big man now wheelchair bound irascible and still at odds with his daughter Hunts careworn Jeannie. To make room for Ernie 14-year-old Jonah (affectingly played by Miller) and younger brother Ethan (Skyler Fortgang) are forced to bunk together. But that is just what starts the deep ripple effect of his arrival. Levine begins teasing out the existing strains of the relationships using that to propel the action. Set in New York with Ned split between work in the city and life in the burbs cinematographer Nancy Schreiber (""Your Friends amp; Neighbors"" ""Serious Moonlight"") intensifies the distance between them a moving in close to capture the claustrophobia at home and pulling back to create space and breathing room at work with Ned awash in open space as things heat up with Robin (Gugino). Ned is a dont-rock-the-boat kind of guy and in Liev Schreiber the filmmaker has a classic boat rocker so the smiles and shrugs dont fit him so well. Hunt and Dennehy are good as father and daughter forced to make accommodations after a lifetime of things not working out. They create small fleeting moments of connection masterfully a Jeannie warming Ernies feet with her hands an impromptu picnic on a wind-whipped day. Its been years since Hunt was in anything as memorable on screen as 1997s ""As Good as It Gets"" still the best of her post-""Mad About You"" work. ""Every Day"" comes as a reminder of her talent for understatement and a wish to see more of her. In fairness that sense of understatement infuses the film. Given that Levine has spent most of his time in the talkie world of TV hes made a clear decision to see how far silence can take him here letting the issues simmer rather than erupt into long rants. Its a bold choice that works more than it fails especially in the scenes between Ned and Jonah a both father and son uneasy with how life is unfolding but finding comfort in the others presence. It is when Neds at the office that you feel the echoes of ""Nip/Tuck"" most strongly. The filmmakers made the character in his own image a TV writer struggling to keep his head above water thats teeming with sharks. The most ruthless is Izzards Garrett with the British comic excellent as the shows executive producer with a nasty bite and always looking for more blood. That Ned spends long hours rewriting is no accidental metaphor. Ultimately the film is about the distances between people and the connections that bind them. Where the story suffers is in integrating those two experiences a the transitions are bumpy at best not believable at worst. Still the flaws are not fatal and the storys worth telling. After all you can spot couples like Ned and Jeannie nearly every day. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com Every Day MPAA rating R for sexual content language and some drug material Running time 1 hour 33 minutes Playing At Laemmles Sunset 5 West Hollywood; South Coast Village Santa Ana MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESMovie review This Is 40 finds truth amid midlife crisis...December 20 2012Movie Review Larry CrowneJuly 1 2011Wide Open SpacesDecember 8 1996MORE STORIES ABOUTOpen SpaceEntertainmentWorkMidlifeCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-every-day-20110114,0,4518635.story",200,everyday4,everyday,latimes

Of all the cliches to suggest parents with their priorities out of whack that one may be worse than excessive cell-phone use because it isnt just a character detail its a whole scene. As a TV writer suffering through a midlife crisis in Every Day Liev Schreiber misses his youngest sons violin recital while boinking a fellow scribe in her swimming pool and thats all that needs to be said about the movie. Writer-director Richard Levine doesnt get more obvious than that--he likely couldnt if he tried--but its the clearest indication that Schreibers misadventures will be common ones. And in case the films message about the constancy of marriage and its long-term enrichments werent already apparent the title takes care of it. Schreiber leads a mostly charmed life His work on a hit cable show called Mercy Medical keeps him and family firmly ensconced in upper-middle-class privilege his wife (Helen Hunt) remains unfailingly caring and decent and his youngest sons are bright and healthy. But lately those same blessings are starting to wear on him. Mercy Medicals showrunner (Eddie Izzard) keeps calling for more cheap shocks in Schreibers scripts. His wifes generosity has led her to bring her cantankerous terminally ill father (Brian Dennehy) into the house. And he cant quite will himself to accept his eldest sons sexuality. In his mild despair Schreiber turns to his colleague Carla Gugino who lives just the kind of coke-snorting skinny-dipping casual-sex-having existence that looks especially appealing to him at the moment. At the movies center Schreiber approaches the role with a seriousness that lacks joy or any other colorful inflection as if every second of his characters life even the pleasurable ones is weighing on him like an albatross. Perhaps this was a deliberate choice on his or Levines part but Every Day seems to shuffle along with him leaving behind a host of supporting players--the terrific Dennehy especially--that might have made more compelling leads. The film follows the grim-faced Schreiber on a journey to that metaphorical recital and getting there is an exasperating slog.

Movies Every Day by Lisa Schwarzbaum Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr SMOOCH Liev Schriber and Carla Gugino in Every Day Posted January 13 2011 -- 1200 AM EST The characters in the TV-influenced indie domestic drama Every Day are intrusively colorful including a husband and dad (Liev Shreiber) with an office job as a scriptwriter for a notoriously raunchy TV series and a mom (Helen Hunt) who is a dead ringer for an older tireder Jamie Buchman from Mad About You. Theres also a precociously self-composed gay teenaged son (Ezra Miller) a mean ailing pee-stained grandpa (Brian Dennehy) and a sexy office temptress (Carla Gugino) who lives in enviable responsibility-free luxury. The specific troubles of this unhappy family are on the other hand colorless -- not so much explored as presented and resolved like a shopping list Its tough to maintain a loving marriage its tough to handle sexual temptation its tough to be a good parent or a good adult child etc. As an unintended result the movie makes it more difficult than it ought to be for its intended audience to empathize with the very real stresses of a middle-aged Sandwich Generation. (The charming self-aware gay teen embraced by his family and having fun at his gay prom is at least a poster kid for an enlightened adolescent experience.) Dads supposedly cool but actually off-putting showbiz career and work environment (Eddie Izzard plays his boss) is better understood knowing that Every Day is a first-time feature project written and directed by TVs Nip/Tuck and Scoundrels executive producer Richard Levine.

Wife Jeannie (Helen Hunt) has begrudgingly allowed her sour incapacitated father (Brian Dennehy) to move into their Queens home; recently out teenage son Jonah (Ezra Miller) has set off Neds mildly homophobic concerns (later realized phobically in the film); Neds boss Garrett (Eddie Izzard) show runner of Mercy Medical demands more labyrinthine debauched storylines. Levine previously a writer for Nip/Tuck sets the bar low content to work within the shopworn crises lazy epiphanies and eye-rolling moments of redemption that have become standard formula in Amerindie family dramedies of the past 20 years. But what distinguishes Levines film from say last years similarly themed (and irredeemable) Happy Tears is his cast--and not just reliable vets like Schreiber. Curly-haired dumpling Skyler Fortgang as Jonahs younger brother Ethan offers much more than just wide-eyed cutes. But its Miller perfectly balancing teenage recalcitrance and vulnerability whos the most exciting to watch Following his debut in Afterschool and City Island hes become one of the best adolescent actors working today.

While ""Every Day"" purportedly celebrates the day-to-day epiphanies of ordinary people it veers closer to highly condensed soap opera as a stalwart husband (Liev Schreiber) juggles professional humiliations his wifes (Helen Hunt) meltdown one sons avowed homosexuality anothers nagging self-doubt and a colleagues sexy come-ons. Ace thesps struggle to lift this dour indie out of the doldrums but writer-director Richard Levine (a TV vet making his feature debut) allows them no breathing room taking their emotional temperature at every turn. Cable play is assured but theatrical prospects seem iffy. When Jeannie (Hunt) brings home her ailing fault-finding father Ernie (Brian Dennehy) her already high stress levels shoot through the roof. Jeannie monitors the crotchety invalids multiple appointments as well as his incontinence and suicide attempts while also running a household raising two kids and keeping an (unspecified) business afloat. As a result shes embittered and altogether unavailable to her husband Ned (Schreiber). Ned meanwhile has hit his own rough patch in his job as a writer for sensationalistic TV skein ""Mercy Medical."" His boss Garrett (Eddie Izzard) insatiable in his quest for ratings constantly rejects Neds storylines in favor of those of envelope-pushing newbie Brian (David Harbour). Garrett further insists Ned work with curvaceous pleasure-seeking broadcast pro Robin (Carla Gugino) who lures him to her luxurious digs complete with inspirational drugs panoramic views of Gotham and a private swimming pool. In general the films depiction of behind-the-scenes screenwriting sessions -- apparently informed by Levines experience producing writing and directing ""Nip/Tuck"" -- benefits greatly from Izzards dramatic volatility Hes surprisingly effective here the boss from hell one minute and a wryly self-aware story supervisor the next. Other actors fare worse as Levine sprinkles joyless learning experiences throughout his claustrophobic domestic portrait each earnest moment marking the characters progress (or lack thereof) on their journey toward right-thinking moderation and tolerance reaffirming the family unit. Neds paranoid (perhaps homophobic) reaction to the sexual preference of teen son Jonah (a blessedly angst-free perf by Ezra Miller) is tempered when Jonah resists the kind of predator his father imagines lurking behind every bush. Young violin prodigy Ethan (a never-cutesy Skyler Fortgang) escapes imaginary fears by tending to his death-haunted grandfather. Even the apparently irredeemable Ernie belatedly reveals a deep love of music which suddenly makes him human if not quite lovable in his daughters eyes. Strong production values surprise considering the films brief shooting schedule and shoestring budget. Every DayProductionA Cold Iron Pictures presentation of an Ambush Entertainment production.
