FIND ME GUILTY --  1/2 -- Vin Diesel Peter Dinklage Alex Rocco; rated R (profanity violence). If you didnt know you were watching Vin Diesel in ""Find Me Guilty"" you wouldnt know you were watching Vin Diesel. And thats a compliment. The strapping smooth-domed action star goes pasty and paunchy -- and hes got hair -- to play real-life mobster Jackie DiNorscio a member of New Jerseys Lucchese family who defended himself in a mammoth federal trial. Cracking wise for the jury in rich gravelly tones Diesel shows a charisma that you might not expect from the star of such blow-em-up fare as ""xXx"" but the performance is also a bit one-note. Hes entertaining and his transformation comes as a surprise but hes that same guy all the time. What isnt surprising is the workmanlike nature of Sidney Lumets film. The veteran director (""12 Angry Men"" ""Dog Day Afternoon"" ""The Verdict"") offers the same sort of sturdy steady drama weve come to rely on from him though the proceedings inevitably feel sort of sluggish after a while. This was after all the longest criminal trial in United States history lasting 21 months between 1987 and 1988 and encompassing 20 defendants accused of 76 different charges. Peter Dinklage and Alex Rocco liven things up with strong supporting performances though and Annabella Sciorra is smoldering as Jackies ex-wife in one sexy scene that calls to mind her Emmy-nominated work as Tonys dangerous mistress on ""The Sopranos."" Having spent half his life behind bars Jackie knows too much and thinks hes more capable of defending himself in court than his lawyer could. Already serving a 30-year drug sentence hes offered the chance to testify against his mob family to shorten his sentence. Not only does he turn down the proposition -- which the sniveling prosecutor delivers along with a steak shrimp cocktail and red wine -- he has the chutzpah to stand up as his own lawyer when the whole Lucchese gang gets taken down. Much of the script from T.J. Mancini and Robert McCrea comes from the actual courtroom testimony and much of that consists of Jackie working the room like a Borscht Belt comedian. ""Dis guy tinks hes Elliot Ness"" he cracks during the prosecutors opening statement -- then during his own he makes a dirty joke that leaves half the jurors laughing and half squirming in their seats. Diesel portrays Jackie as swaggering and volatile; he has no internal censor which is an exciting thing to watch. Until the shtick becomes predictable. Eventually he learns how much he can get away with by bantering with the judge and from the advice he receives from levelheaded lawyer Ben Klandis who represents one of the higher-ranking mob members. (Rocco is an ideal fit as mob boss Nick Calabrese who is cruelly dismissive of the eager-to-please Jackie at every opportunity.) With his resonant voice and intelligent manner Dinklage brings great gravitas to the role; the diminutive star of the indie hit ""The Station Agent"" once again makes you quickly forget his stature. He actually towers right alongside the films more famous leading man. ""Find Me Guilty"" is rated R for strong language and some violence. Running time 124 minutes.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Mancini Robert J. McCrea; Release Date Wide 03/17/2006; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Yari Film Group Posted March 15 2006 -- 1200 AM EST The galvanizing return of The Sopranos with the series authoritative grasp of ethics and consequence doesnt do any favors for Find Me Guilty a sharp-looking Mob drama with a gooey moral center. Based on the real-life testimony of Giacomo ""Jackie Dee"" DiNorscio a member of New Jerseys Lucchese crime family facing a 30-year sentence the movie is a shorthand version of what became the longest criminal trial in U.S. history For 21 months during 1987?88 20 Lucchese associates were tried on 76 different charges. Each wiseguy had his own defense attorney -- all except DiNorscio who represented himself. As Vin Diesel plays him in a likable image-adjusting turn -- prosthetically fat thick of Jersey accent -- Jackie (who died in 2004) was about as sweet as a career criminal can be; he was also a showman a comedian a doozy. And the fact that he refused to rat on his family is admired -- with irksomely naive neutrality -- as its own form of nobility. Never mind that Find Me Guilty is directed by that great 81-year-old chronicler of urban law and disorder Sidney Lumet. Diesels DiNorscio is styled as an untouchably charismatic mook in the softy script by T.J. Mancini and Robert McCrea which cant decide whether to smile or laugh outright at the governments efforts to break the power of organized crime. As a result the rest of the players -- a great clutch of guys including Peter Dinklage as a precise and persuasive lawyer Linus Roache as an obsessed federal prosecutor and Ron Silver as the judge -- are never granted a fair day in court.

Vin Diesel and Annabella Sciorra star in Find Me Guilty a drama based on a true story. Yari Film Group The film based on the true story of the longest Mafia trial in U.S. history is heavy-handed and cliched. Perhaps most offensive of all it seeks to celebrate the adorable qualities of hardened criminals and wants us to root for their freedom. The most lovable of the band of thugs on trial -- or at least the loudest -- is Jack DiNorscio a two-bit New Jersey wise guy played or rather mugged by Vin Diesel in a bad wig. He has a cockeyed sense of honor (dont all Hollywood gangsters?) and prides himself on never ratting on a buddy. Though severely limited in his speechifying skills he decides to represent himself in court. About the movieFind Me Guilty  (out of four) Director Sidney Lumet Stars Vin Diesel Peter Dinklage Alex Rocco Ron Silver Distributor Yari Film Group Rating R for strong language and some violence Running time 2 hours 4 minutes Expands Friday to select cities Apparently nobody warned him of the old saw about those who do so having a fool for a client. Calling him a fool is an understatement. His defense shtick makes the worst Catskills comic seem brilliantly witty. A favorite saying ""Im not a gangster. Im a gagster."" Gag me. Watching the complex emotional range of someone like Tony Soprano is one thing but feeling anything for a lunk-headed mobster like the one Diesel plays is quite another. Veteran director Sidney Lumet (Dog Day Afternoon The Verdict) has done much better work. The unfolding of the two-year-long trial is never suspenseful. Instead it has the feeling of a dated sitcom. To wit An old mobster has a heart attack and is sent to the hospital. When the trial reconvenes hes wheeled back into the courtroom in his hospital bed tethered to tubes. Lo and behold he nods off during some repetitive testimony and falls off the bed. Get it? Thats funny. Cue laugh track. Diesel seems desperate to prove he can do more than grunt and pull off action stunts. But what he does do thanks to the cringe-worthy script by director Lumet T.J. Mancini and Robert McCrea amounts to obnoxious posturing usually punctuated with a goofy ear-to-ear grin. Diesel chews up so much scenery he must have gone through several cases of dental floss during filming. He might want to consider going back to glowering and flexing his muscles.

Starring Vin Diesel Ron Silver Linus Roache Annabella Sciorra. Co-written and directed by Sidney Lumet. (Rated R. 124 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In Sidney Lumets movies the American justice system is a character like his heroes flawed sometimes corrupt idealistic a little bit stupid -- and inherently good. Perhaps no director has so thoroughly explored the American concept of police work prosecution and legal justice and ""Find Me Guilty"" is a film that brings the 81-year-old filmmaker thematically full circle back to his starting point 1957s ""12 Angry Men."" The subject is the longest criminal trial in United States history the 1987-88 conspiracy trial of 20 members of the Lucchese crime family and the unusual behavior of the colorful Jackie DiNorscio who conducted his own legal defense. Vin Diesel may not seem to be in the natural line of succession of Lumets individual-battling-the-system icons such as Henry Fonda (""12 Angry Men"") Sean Connery (""The Anderson Tapes"") Al Pacino (""Serpico"" ""Dog Day Afternoon"") or Paul Newman (""The Verdict"") but believe it or not hes perfect. The film begins with Jackie getting shot four times by his junkie cousin Tony (""Youre my cousin I love you"" Jackie wails as he rolls off his bed and shields himself with pillows and blankets). He refuses to identify Tony to the police and that eventually leads to Jackies imprisonment because Tony fearing retribution has turned states evidence. The federal investigation which had been a yearslong undercover operation doesnt stop at Jackie -- they think theyve got the goods on 19 other members of the crime family. A career-obsessed prosecutor (Linus Roache) decides hes got enough to try all 20 of the Luccheses so the case goes to trial which is held in a bizarrely configured courtroom. All 20 family members sit at long tables next to their defense lawyers -- except for Jackie who decides to conduct his own defense. ""Do you have any legal experience?"" asks the judge (an excellent Ron Silver). ""Ive been in prison half my life"" Jackie says. The movie claims that the trial scenes were based on court transcripts of the actual case. If so it is amazing Jackie was ever allowed to defend himself. He constantly strays from his line of questioning -- sometimes telling dirty jokes -- and repeatedly badgers witnesses. He is a laughingstock to the other family members and their legal team which is led by the brilliant and levelheaded Ben Klandis (Peter Dinklage of ""The Station Agent"") who happens to be a dwarf. In an era of trials such as O.J. Simpson Robert Blake and Michael Jackson where juries seem to be swayed by their emotions rather than evidence ""Find Me Guilty"" clearly has something to say. Lumet who co-wrote the script knew this when he directed ""12 Angry Men."" But his view of the justice system and law enforcement has clearly changed since then. The federal investigation as it is described by agents who serve as witnesses during the trial could have been bungled by the same agents who couldnt put two and two together in ""The Anderson Tapes."" The corruption and big money Paul Newman went up against in ""The Verdict"" has only gotten worse. Is Lumet by making a confessed gangster the hero of his movie suggesting that it is time for legal reform? Its hard to say. What we can report is that Lumet is back on top of his game -- ""Find Me Guilty"" is his first feature after the awful 1999 remake of ""Gloria"" and the reason is his strong grasp of characters who have a point of view. His camera creeps closer and closer to the action as the film unfolds but the chief reason is he draws some terrific performances from the actors starting with Diesel (who knew he had it in him?) whose charismatic performance might signal a whole new direction in his career (hopefully). Dinklage probably as different from Diesel as anyone could be more than matches him. The best scene in the film comes about three-quarters of the way in when Jackies ex-wife (Annabella Sciorra nearly unrecognizable) visits his cell to console him on the death of his mother. She obviously hates him -- they get into an argument. Jackie lets her call him a louse. Then with a smile and a tender caress she is in his arms. At the end of that scene you know which way the jury will go. -- Advisory Strong violence and foul language.

To the charge of sentimentalizing murderous mob men guilty To the charge of questionable casting by an aging director seeking star power guilty To the charge of making viewers feel as imprisoned as the films jury which served for two years guilty To the charge of utterly failing to entertain not guilty. Though one out of four isnt good at least this tale of Americas longest mafia trial offers guilty pleasures. One is seeing a fine director Sidney Lumet at work. Another is seeing a stuffy legal system wriggle when an Everyman defends himself with unorthodox banter and disarming openness. But in the end Find Me Guilty cant get past the stunt casting of its lead role. Forget the large supporting cast. This is an ill-deserved star turn for Vin Diesel an actor who crashed to earth soon after his hyped ""superstardom"" four years ago and whos had just one hit since in the kid comedy The Pacifier. Here Diesel plays Giacomo ""Fat Jack"" DiNorscio one of many New Jersey mobsters targeted by the feds in hopes of netting a huge haul in one judicial sweep. Refusing to ""rat"" Jack is fiercely loyal to fellow mob men -- even though one ordered his execution -- and distrustful of his counsel. So he defends himself injecting humor and humanity into the dry droning process. ""Im not a gangster -- Im a gagster"" he says with a broad smile thats as innocent as a Cheshire cats. But for all Jacks garrulous charm the accused are suspected drug dealers and killers and toying with the system to set them free is no laughing matter. Even if it were the laughs subside when a stern judge (Ron Silver) mutes his grandstanding leaving the wheels of justice to grind more slowly and somberly as the trial drags on. By the end you may care what happens to Jack and his crime cronies but if so its because you were manipulated by Lumet a man who probed disorder in the court more satisfyingly with 1982s The Verdict. Of course then he had Paul Newman as star not Diesel. The latter performs ably in his tough but affable mode showing off jaunty good humor and blunt combativeness. But Diesel lacks the underlying edge that would make him believable as a gangster not just a court jester and his selflessness just doesnt add up. To the charge of squandering credibility despite being based on a true case guilty.

For Hollywood there is ""WWTT?"" The Vin Diesel vehicle (sorry) ""Find Me Guilty"" demands that we define the bumper-sticker question What were they thinking? Must we really champion a mob drug dealer arm-breaker and generalized sociopath in a serious courtroom drama? Did someone think hanging a New Jersey goombah accent on Diesel and shrouding his action-man pecs in a fat suit would be enough to widen his range? Do we really want to follow a trial with 20 defendants that lasted more than 600 days even if its compressed to slightly over two hours? Director Sidney Lumet may yet win a lifetime Oscar for a string of smart hits from ""Serpico"" to ""The Verdict."" But Lumets tepid 90s and 00s have allowed us to forget his earlier skills and Diesel is not the actor to refresh those memories. ""Find Me Guilty"" is slow repetitive flat and altogether wrongheaded using suspect editing of a true story to make us celebrate a bunch of vicious crooks. We get a few early minutes outside the courthouse before plunging into an endless series of judicial sidebars and breaks for mob-sponsored lunches. Vin Diesel is Jackie DiNorscio a low-level mob operative specializing in drugs eating and trying to catch up on sleep. His junkie cousin walks into Jackies bedroom and shoots him four times barely wounding the fat-insulated Diesel. Jackie graciously forgives the cousin (Raul Esparza) in the first of many unconvincing speeches about taking care of ""family."" But the feds are serious about taking on the New York-New Jersey mafia and after a drug bust Jackie is offered a deal by prosecutors Testify against your beloved family and get off easy. Diesels journey from Italian-inflected homeboy to hotheaded hero is immediate and therefore uninteresting. He will not testify Instead he will become his own lawyer and sit with the crowd of defendants in a Jersey courtroom cracking bad vaudeville jokes. Lumet and his scriptwriting partners based the story on a colorful Lucchese family member of the 1980s. But to sell their underdog-with-a-bite tale they must dumb down the prosecution so relentlessly that no one would ever buy it. These wise guys are killers dope dealers exploiters of the weak. Yet all the U.S. district attorney can come up with for the jury is an FBI agents misquote of Machiavelli? Yes lets do break for lunch I need some antacid. The arguments boil down to this Defense Youre trying to convict us just because were a bunch of felons who happen to speak Italian Prosecution But you ARE a bunch of felons who happen to speak Italian Defense Thats irrelevant If the ""real-life"" courtroom bought that exchange then there will be good company in some circle of purgatory for the O.J. jury. Myself I fear Lumet and crew just left a lot out of the picture including much that would make it a good picture.

With Sam Shepard Jessica Lange Tim Roth. (122 min.)The latest pairing of director Wim Wenders and playwright Sam Shepard has some of the same woozy lyricism as their first ""Paris Texas."" Shepard himself plays the lead this time - an over-the-hill cowboy star named Howard Spence who ditches his latest movie to embark on a personal odyssey. He ends up in Butte Mont. with a private detective (Roth) hired by the movie company in relentless pursuit. Howard meets up with a waitress (Lange) he once loved and discovers not one but two offspring that he never knew he fathered. Judged on any kind of rational level this film is a mess and Fairuza Balk as a punky friend of Howards son gives the single most annoying performance I have ever seen. But Franz Lustigs cinematography has a Walker Evans-like power. Grade B-- Peter RainerFind Me GuiltyDirector Sidney Lumet. WIth Vin Diesel Ron Silver. (125 min.) Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Sidney Lumet has often been called an actors director and certainly he has made it possible for some great actors ranging from Al Pacino (in ""Dog Day Afternoon"") to Katharine Hepburn (in ""Long Days Journey Into Night"") to give their greatest performances. But what about not-so-great actors? What about - to get to the matter at hand - Vin Diesel? Actually hes far from talentless and before he embarked on his action-figure phase he did creditable work in such films as ""Boiler Room."" In ""Find Me Guilty"" playing real-life mobster ""Jackie Dee"" DiNorscio he has covered his trademark bald pate with what appears to be the worlds worst hairpiece. Jackie is made out to be a hero because acting also as his own defense attorney he refused to testify against his Lucchese crime family cohorts in what became the longest criminal trial in US history. Most Mafia movies are unduly sympathetic but this one takes the cake. Peter Dinklage is excellent as the mobs chief lawyer. Grade B-- P.R. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test?

(105 min.)Chalk up another film to the ""Whatever Gets Kids To Read Shakespeare"" category. This chipper teen farce is a riff on ""Twelfth Night"" with innately funny girl Amanda Bynes of TVs ""What I Like About You"" as a teen masquerading as her twin brother in order to play on the boys soccer team. While it may not be as sharp as recent angst touchstone ""Mean Girls"" or as guilty a pleasure as the similar 1986 flick ""Just One Of The Guys"" it leaves viewers wanting more - if not more Bard then at least more of its hyperkinetic unabashed young star.

Sidney Lumet continues his remarkable six-decade run of New York-set dramas and Vin Diesel returns from the action-film gulag to give a shambling comic turn as the real-life mobster who hijacked a huge trial in the goombah comedy-drama ""Find Me Guilty."" Emphasizing the comic aspects of tale will help pull thesps ""Pacifier"" fans though dicey prosthetics and wig work may alienate those who prefer him buff n bald. Verdict here for mid-March opening is moderate to good biz with strong cultish ancillary possible. In 1987-88 some 20 members of the Lucchese crime family each with his own lawyer were brought to trial on some 76 charges ranging from criminal conspiracy to narcotics trafficking. The jam-packed trial dragged on for 21 months and the shocking verdict is the stuff of legal legend. Earlier after being pumped full of lead by his strung-out cousin Tony Compagna (Raul Esparza) Lucchese crime figure Giacomo ""Jackie Dee"" DiNorscio (Diesel) is jailed on charges based on the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act. Thinking he can co-opt the mobster to roll over on his family during the massive proceedings comically hard-charging prosecutor Sean Kierney (Linus Roache) offers a reduction in DiNorscios 30-year sentence in return for his testimony. Jackie Dee refuses. As the trial gets under way the mobster decides to represent himself against the advice of by-the-book lead defense attorney Ben Klandis (Peter Dinklage). What follows are extended comic riffs to the jury by DiNorscio apparently drawn from trial transcripts that put him at odds both with long-suffering Judge Finestein (Ron Silver) and vicious crime boss co-defendant Nick Calabrese (Alex Rocco). Part mob-trial thriller part ""dese n dose"" extended standup routine character-rich pic plays like vintage Lumet mining the grim comedy from life-and-death legal wranglings in the manner of ""Dog Day Afternoon"" ""Prince of the City"" and ""The Verdict."" And if Diesels perf as a real-life wisecracking wise guy isnt quite at the iconic level of Al Pacino Treat Williams or Paul Newman neither is it as determinedly one-dimensional as his action hero persona. Genuinely committed to the mob family DiNorscio is imbued by Diesel with genuine emotional ambivalence Perhaps as Calabrese thinks hes an opportunist looking to save his own skin. But maybe as Jackie Dee keeps saying family is everything. Principal supporting cast is aces. Roache manages to make the cartoonish Kierney a legitimate force and the straight-faced readings of Dinklage Silver and crime film vet Rocco ground the pic in gravitas. Annabella Sciorra gives a master class on tough-gal posturing in her single memorable scene as DiNorscios tough-as-nails ex-wife. Huge supporting cast is stocked with primo New York theater talent as well as faces familiar to anyone who watches crime shows on the tube. Other than Diesels spotty makeup and dubious wig tech credits are tops. Audaciously framed closeups from d.p. Ron Fortunato hark back to Lumets days in live television while wider panning shots of production designer Christopher Nowaks elegantly threadbare courtroom jammed to the rafters with goodfellas are funny in and of themselves.

"Find Me Guilty | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; find-me-guilty ) Find Me Guilty (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli Vin Diesel as a Joisey mobster? As improbable as it might sound Diesel offers a credible turn as Giacomo Jackie D DiNorscio one of about 20 members of the Lucchese crime family to go on trial for violation of the RICO (Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organization) Act. Despite being saddled with bad prosthetics and a ridiculous wig Diesel displays more acting ability than in the testosterone-soaked genre where he has carved out a niche. Find Me Guilty requires him to do drama and comedy without the benefit of an action net and his slip-ups are few and minor. As director Sidney Lumet proved with The Verdict he can be at home in the hallowed halls of justice and Find Me Guilty is a courtroom procedural. Theres some comedy mixed in - the real Jackie Ds stint as his own lawyer often resembled a stand-up act - but this is basically what you would expect from a solidly made account of an infamous mob trial. Lumet and his co-screenwriters have culled large chunks of dialogue from the actual transcripts disallowing the possibility of the film to venturing too far from the facts. But theres a crucial difference between Find Me Guilty and the traditional courtroom drama. Typically this kind of story is about an guiltless man trying to prove his innocence. Here its about a guilty man trying to bamboozle a jury. The trial takes place over a 21-month period between early 1987 and late 1988. Each mobster has his own lawyer except Jackie who decided to defend himself - against the advice of the lead defense counsel Ben Klandis (Peter Dinklage) and the judge (Ron Silver). Jackie Ds lack of respectability earns him a 10000 fine and the contempt of mob boss Nick Calabrese (Alex Rocco) but endears him to the jury. And when circumstances demand it he can turn serious. Jackie who is serving a 30-year sentence for drug possession refuses an offer from D.A. Sean Kierney (Linus Roache) to get out sooner in return for his testimony. For Jackie nothing is worse than ratting on his family and its something he wont do even when members of that ""family"" (like Nick) turn against him. (Jackie was released from prison on parole a few years ago then died while this movie was in production.) There are times when Find Me Guilty plays more like My Cousin Vinny than The Verdict. (Ironically Diesel accepted the role after Joe Pesci turned it down) Theres plenty of humor to be found here. Yet at its heart this is a drama and the often light tone belies the dark currents churning beneath the straightforward plot. Find Me Guilty illustrates the collapse of the American judicial system and those failings are fueled not by corruption or bribery but by prosecutorial incompetence and defense guile. Compared to this the O.J. Simpson trial which would become compulsive viewing half a decade later was a model of decorum. The director has surrounded his big-name star with a stellar supporting cast. Dinklage Silver and Roache stand out and each is given scenes in which they are allowed to display their acting chops. Craggy-faced Alex Rocco is perfect as the sour Nick Calabrese. Its not hard to understand why Rocco has been stereotyped into this kind of part. And Annabella Sciorra leaves an impression as Jackies ex-wife despite appearing in only one scene. Lumets approach to the subject is bare-bones. Roughly 75% of the scenes take place in the courtroom. Shots are composed in a straightforward manner and camera angles are basic. The film avoids over-editing and unnecessary close-ups. This is the best methodology the director could have employed since it allows his talented cast and solid script to remain unencumbered by technical flourishes. Find Me Guilty is not the best work Lumet has done but its worthwhile viewing for anyone who likes gangsters courtrooms and what happens when the two are brought together.
