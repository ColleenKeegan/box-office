The less welcome news is that though the pic delivers on action it dawdles through downtime. The good news about ""Lara Croft Tomb Raider The Cradle of Life"" is that Angelina Jolie is even hotter faster and more commanding than last time around as the fearless heiress/adventuress plus a little more human. The less welcome news is that most of the same shortcomings that cramped the first installment are still dogging the sequel which delivers on action but dawdles through downtime. The legions of fans of the character and the interactive game she sprang from should pump mighty initial returns for this Paramount release both in the U.S. and internationally but pic looks unlikely to escape the steep falloff of other summer blockbusters. Director Jan De Bont perhaps has a sharper handle on the action sequences and as a former cinematographer brings a more muscular visual quality than predecessor Simon West but he wades through the exposition and quieter moments with a disappointing lack of verve. In his first screenplay to hit theaters new scripter Dean Georgaris -- who penned the upcoming ""Manchurian Candidate"" remake and ""Paycheck"" for Richard Donner -- improves on the original in one significant area He generates some sexual heat for Lara. But he fails to invent a satisfyingly worthy adversary. Working from a story by Steven E. De Souza and James V. Hart Georgaris concocts a fairly routine assembly of derivations from 007 and Indiana Jones pics in an assortment of far-flung locations saving excursions into the fantasy realm for the climactic stretch. What makes all this reasonably compelling is the novelty of watching a killer action babe flying solo. Jolies sexy physicality and rubber-armored curves made the 2001 movie a guilty pleasure for many beyond the obvious core audience of teen game geeks and pushed worldwide grosses to 275 million. While the kick-ass chicks of ""Charlies Angels"" are equally handy with their fists and feet -- though less so with weaponry -- they are decidedly more jokey and flirtatious. That trio is composed of girls who want to have fun and clean up crime while they do it. Jolies Lara Croft is all woman with little time for girly frivolousness though amusingly she does ride sidesaddle during horseback target practice. Lara makes a spectacular entrance Wearing a black bikini and straddling a Jet-Ski she pirouettes alongside a boat off the Greek island of Santorini. She then leads a team in a diving expedition to a submerged ancient temple. Here she discovers a glowing golden orb just in time for Chinese Shay-Ling bandits to arrive slay her backup boys snatch the treasure and leave her to die. The orb contains an encrypted map to Pandoras box said to enclose forces of unimaginable evil. This makes it an attractive proposition for Dr. Jonathan Reiss (Ciaran Hinds) a Nobel Prize-winning scientist-gone-bad who now manufactures biological weapons. Enlisted by MI6 to track the Shay-Ling in the Chinese mountains and recover the orb Lara insists on backup from Scottish former agent Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler) with whom she has a romantic history and whose ultimate loyalties remain in question. After he is released from a Kazakhstan prison the pair drops via jet pod into China then proceeds on motorbikes before being taken prisoner. Lara takes on bandit leader Chen Lo (Simon Yam) in a cave full of terracotta warriors -- just one scene in which the tomb raider appears to demolish more antiquities than she could ever hope to uncover -- before she and Terry make a sheer-drop escape. The orb changes hands repeatedly -- and repetitively -- heading to Hong Kong where Reiss steps in. But the ball bounces back into Laras court and she heads with it to Kilimanjaro handcuffing still-untrustworthy Terry to a bedpost during a sexual grapple to keep him out of her hair. Conveniently Lara skydives into a jeep driven by her former college chum Kosa (Djimon Hounsou) whose tribal chiefs warn of the danger of opening Pandoras box. Given that Lara prefers to incapacitate rather than eliminate her enemies keep coming back and when Reiss appears he insists she lead him to the boxs hiding place in the cradle of life. This involves crossing a petrified forest full of menacing creatures. The discovery of Pandoras box delivers more of a fizzle than the apocalyptic bang toward which the action appears headed underlining the films failure to back up the eminently watchable heroine with anyone or anything equally dynamic. Invigorated by David Tattersalls agile camerawork and audacious angles the action scenes and some of the stunt work have plenty of energy. But theres a rote feel to the way its all threaded together revealing the PC game origins. Jolie seems to be enjoying herself more this time; shes cool and poised yet injects a little humor and warmth into her plummy British delivery as well as some hint of desire and romantic longing. But while Terry is a hardbodied hunk who can keep pace with Lara physically and Butler plays him with a sexy smile and a dangerous double edge the script makes too little of the chemistry between them. Far more unsatisfying are Reiss and his vengeful henchman (Til Schweiger) both drably generic purveyors of evil. Lindy Hemmings costumes are again a key element in defining Lara and while the characters signature hot pants and thigh holsters have been partially retired theres a knockout new wardrobe addition in a silver wetsuit with the most brazenly crotch-enhancing leatherwork since chaps first hit the Castro. Laras impeccably turned out in regionally appropriate garb at all times slipping into an embroidered silk bomber jacket in China or safari chic in Africa. Her makeup stays flawless through all kinds of combat and even her injuries look hot with artfully applied aesthetically appealing blood spatters. Other off-camera contributions are strong including returning production designer Kirk M. Petruccellis grand-scale sets and Alain Silvestris orchestral suspense score mixed with occasional techno-rock elements. Digital f/x work is slick aside from one very obvious CGI shark with which Lara goes head to head in a tongue-in-cheek encounter.

Comments Lara Croft Tomb Raider The Cradle of Life Angelina Jolie returns as video-game heroine Lara Croft a beautiful British noble who dabbles in pillaging third world treasure. This time shes trying to locate Pandoras Box before its snapped up by a diabolical arms merchant (the wonderfully crusty Irish character actor Ciaran Hinds). This Indiana Jones knockoff goes down smoothly enough and Jolie isnt bad at all though every time she opened her mouth I expected Mick Jagger to come dancing down her tongue.

"A Few Pixels Short of a Personality washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living >> Follow Style On A Few Pixels Short of a Personality Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 25 2003 Is anyone better suited to a role these days than Angelina Jolie to the computer game heroine Lara Croft? The preternaturally stunning actress of the smashing figure smoldering eyes and wasp-stung pout is so otherworldly looking she might have been conceived by the most sexually frustrated gaming nerd in Silicon Valley. If she werent human no one would believe such a creature really exists. Jolie brings an arctic cool to her portrayal of the title character in ""Lara Croft Tomb Raider The Cradle of Life."" In a summer of surprisingly self-serious comic book movies she stands out as being particularly humorless. In a way this is altogether appropriate to her virtual provenance but it makes for a grim two-hour sit. ""The Cradle of Life"" goes through its motions with gotta-make-the-doughnuts deliberation (""Now we have a shootout. Now we do motorcycles. Next some sky diving. Now another shootout.""); by the time the movie -- finally -- reaches its climactic scene in an acid pit somewhere in Africa the audience isnt rapt with suspense as much as wracked with an enervated sense of predictability. Throughout Jolie has been such an unsmiling presence that the films final unspeakably patronizing stab at humor looks like a flat-footed outtake from a ""Charlies Angels"" audition. ""The Cradle of Life"" opens with a Greek wedding that is interrupted by one big fat earthquake. The disaster it turns out has shaken free some tantalizing treasures beneath the Aegean Sea. Enter Lara Croft the aristocratic British adventuress whose posh accent belies a talent for kicking major posterior. In other words the chick has chops whether shes shooting a gun fencing with fighting sticks or simply reducing her opponent to aspic with a withering glance. All these skills will be called on when she uncovers an ancient temple that holds a map to Pandoras box -- that legendary reliquary of pestilence evil and sundry ill humors. (Or at least thats ""the Sunday school version"" Croft says in a breathtakingly strange bit of exegesis.) Whats more she must foil biological arms dealer Jonathan Reiss (Ciaran Hinds) who figures to find the box and sell it on the open market thus ensuring the worlds destruction. True to the first ""Lara Croft"" movie ""The Cradle of Life"" takes its protagonist to myriad exciting locales from Santorini and Buckinghamshire to Hong Kong Kazakhstan Shanghai and Mount Kilimanjaro. Unlike the first movie in a somewhat clever twist her mission isnt to uncover an entombed treasure but to leave it be. Director Jan De Bont (""Speed"" ""Twister"") choreographs the action with workmanlike skill whether Croft is engaging in some sidesaddle target practice on her country estate motocrossing along the Great Wall of China pole-vaulting onto a hovering helicopter using an inflatable flying suit to soar over Hong Kong Harbor or engaging in a shootout at what looks like the Clinique counter at Bloomies. (In case the audience has dozed off De Bont makes sure to introduce each stunt and new gadget with a thumpingly synthetic musical cue.) Its all quite busy and bombastic and theres nothing wrong -- in fact theres a lot right -- with watching Jolie be her spectacular self in cool costumes and exotic locales. But the films story and supporting characters -- including an untrustworthy love interest played by Gerard Butler -- arent nearly enough to make ""The Cradle of Life"" more than another sequel cashing in on its pre-sold audience without providing anything by way of sparkle wit or originality. Theres a phrase for franchises that have outlived their freshness ""jumping the shark"" referring to an infamous ""Happy Days"" episode featuring Fonzie on water skis. In ""The Cradle of Life"" Lara Croft doesnt jump the shark -- shes much too refined for such blatant pandering -- but she does manage to take it for a ride. Lara Croft Tomb Raider The Cradle of Life (116 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for action violence and some sensuality.

Lara Croft. Angelina Jolie with Djimon Hounsou does a fine job bringing this glam cartoon babe to life. Though shes a video game construct shes still the closest female equivalent to Bond. Angelina Jolies Lara Croft is never ruffled frazzled or scared. She always looks dazzling and manages to vanquish all her foes. And she has an easy way with a clever seductive or withering quip. Though shes not as interested in romance as Bond (shes more of an innocent flirt) she inspires a similar admiration from the opposite sex. If a woman could be labeled suave its Lara Croft and Jolie does a fine job bringing this glam cartoon babe to life. Review of the movie Lara Croft Tomb Raider The Cradle of Life ( out of four) Stars Angelina Jolie Gerard Butler Noah Taylor Djimon Hounsou Director Jan De Bont Distributor Paramount Pictures Rating PG-13 for action violence and some sensuality Opens Friday nationwide Lara Croft Tomb Raider The Cradle of Life is more capably directed better edited and sharper-looking than the 2001 original though the script remains mediocre and banal. As the movie opens a not-so-fat Greek wedding in Santorini is interrupted by a violent quake triggered by high-decibel music. Thanks to some geologic shifts an undersea world is unearthed. Lara investigates. Her dramatic entrance on a jet ski is the antithesis of Johnny Depps tattered sailing intrusion into the harbor in another summer sea adventure Pirates of the Caribbean. Too bad the rest of the movie isnt quite as much fun. Eluding a team of deep-sea divers and performing a litany of physical feats she finds Pandoras box. Its quickly stolen from her by Chen Lo (Simon Yam) the leader of a Chinese crime syndicate whos in league with the villainous Jonathan Reiss (Ciaran Hinds) whose plans for the powerful box entail the annihilation of the world. For a movie based on a video game the story is as far-fetched and the characters as one-dimensional as one might expect. And even though the special effects and action sequences are good the monsters conjured up are rather humdrum. Cradles also a bit too long at just under two hours. A relatively mindless action movie such as this would be better at 90 minutes.

Starring Angelina Jolie and Gerard Butler. Directed by Jan de Bont. (PG-13. 130 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) For most of its running time ""Lara Croft Tomb Raider The Cradle of Life"" is a creditable genre entry the rare action movie with a discernible story an assured pace and a charismatic central character. It falls apart in the end. The filmmakers fall in love with their computer and the film becomes awash in computer-graphic monsters and fireballs. But still what a surprise The first ""Tomb Raider"" was an incoherent mess while this . . . this isnt half bad. Its a quarter bad at most. Heres a movie for second chances. In the first ""Tomb Raider"" Angelina Jolie did little besides make her eyes go dead and her mouth hang open in close-up. Here she stops imitating a dead mackerel and acts lively. And then theres director Jan de Bont who gave the world ""Speed 2"" and ""The Haunting"" films that seemed to place him irretrievably in the land of shaky handheld cameras and action sequences that made audiences reach for the barf bag. Here without sacrificing velocity de Bont gives us a clean watchable film with some exciting sequences. Related Stories VIDEO OF THE WEEK / Kicking butt on land and below water All trace of the ""Tomb Raider"" video game has been expunged from memory including the pointy bra. Now Lara is an adventuress in the Allan Quatermain mode who starts the movie on an undersea expedition to find the Luna Temple an artifact from the days of Alexander the Great. She finds it and then in a shootout with archaeological bandits she destroys it. Oh well. After 2300 years it was bound to happen. BATTLING EVIL The search is on for Pandoras box. Irish actor Ciaran Hinds plays Reiss an international terrorist who wants to find the box so he can make the entire world deathly ill -- and then pick and choose who gets to live. He wants to keep alive only the best of the best including ""heads of state and heads of corporations."" Of course there will be neither corporations nor states in this new world order what with everyone dead and all but these details can be worked out later. The movie goes out of its way to inform us that Reiss is a Nobel Prize winner as if all Nobel laureates go a little wiggy like Demi Moore in ""Charlies Angels Full Throttle"" or Linus Pauling. The kick of the new ""Tomb Raider"" is in seeing an action heroine capable of doing anything and the appeal of Jolie with her broad shoulders and exaggerated features is that she is exotic enough to be believable. She jumps from the top of a building in a glider suit and steers across a major city before parachuting onto the deck of a ship. In another scene she parachutes into a jeep riding through the African wilderness and takes over the wheel. At home she relaxes by listening to Delibes ""Lakme"" while practicing ninja combat. Lara is paired for most of her adventures with newcomer Gerard Butler as Sheridan a former lover turned traitor whom she gets out of prison to assist her on the Pandora case. Its a nice touch that Sheridan while charming and capable is inferior to Lara in every way but brute strength. His character is weaker and hes not as smart. Its an unspoken sorrow for Lara throughout the film -- she sees him for what he is almost a great guy but not a real partner for her. GLOBE-TROTTING CHASE The chase takes the movie to Greece to Shanghai and to Hong Kong and theres a certain pleasure to be had just in the travelogue aspect of it. The skylines of Shanghai and Hong Kong for example look utterly modern and yet decidedly but imperceptibly non-Western. Then the action moves to Kenya and thats when the action bogs down in effects. Its probably safe to assume that once a studio pays for an effect it wants to use it. But in ""The Cradle of Life"" the graphics slow the action even the good graphics. Several minutes are devoted to scenes of monsters leaping out from rocks grabbing people and disappearing back into the rocks. Well done but the monsters stop the movie exactly when it needs to be hurtling forward. Advisory This film contains violence and some sexual situations.

"Tomb Raider The Cradle of Life | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; tomb-raider-the-cradle-of-life ) Tomb Raider The Cradle of Life (United States 2003) A movie review by James Berardinelli Tomb Raider The Cradle of Life arrives stillborn the misbegotten offspring of filmmakers who are so greedy that they probably wouldnt hesitate to plunder a grave or two. I would be tempted to recommend this movie as being entertainment of the ""so bad you wont believe your eyes"" variety if it wasnt so deadly boring. As impressive as Angelina Jolies many physical feats may be it takes even more stamina and fortitude to stay awake during the movies seemingly endless two-hour running length. Once more I feel I must make this plea please do not throw things at the projectionist or attempt to kill the ushers. All ire should be directed at the men and women at Paramount Pictures. The first Tomb Raider was dumb fun - a computer game-inspired take-off on the Indiana Jones series with Angelina Jolie bringing everyones favorite PC adventuress Lara Croft to life. Jolie seemed to be having fun her father was involved (an ""olive branch"" she would later call it) and the movie had a breezy energy. I enjoyed Tomb Raider even though it defied logic and many of the laws of physics. Tomb Raider The Cradle of Life is just plain dumb. Gone is John Voight (banished from Jolies personal life as well as her professional one). Jolie shows few signs of enjoying herself. And the movie has abandoned its Indiana Jones motif in favor of a James Bond one. So Lara is now Jane Bond on her Majestys Secret Service with a license to kill and some very bad music to accompany her stuntwork. If only the badness was relegated to the music... Unfortunately thats no more than a mild annoyance. Like so many of this summers would-be blockbuster sequels this one is determined to prove that it is simple to make action scenes that are dull predictable and lacking in even the most rudimentary sense of tension. Theres a motorcycle chase with no pursuers (just Lara and a pal zooming around on the bikes with no one behind them). There are fights galore many of which involve bad CGI monsters or bad CGI collapsing temples. Theres more cheese here than in the Kraft section of a large grocery store but its all moldy. Maybe The Cradle of Life would have some value as a computer game (although the plot seems more in tune with an Atari 2600 cartridge game than something for a Pentium IV) but in that arena theres some interactivity. Here the filmmakers are playing the audience. Like most video games this one is divided into chapters. In the first segment Lara goes diving into the ruins of an ancient temple in search of a glowing globe. But the treasure is stolen from her by the henchmen of the evil ex-Noble Prize winner Jonathan Reiss (Ciaran Hinds) who wants it for his own nefarious means. It apparently is the key to locating Pandoras Box which contains a nasty plague that he can unleash on humanity. Why? Because it amuses him. He is after a ""modern-day Dr. Mengele."" Act II has Lara now paired with her mercenary ex-lover Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler) chasing the globe around China. She eventually catches up to it in Hong Kong. Then its on to Chapter III in Africa where the Cradle of Life/Pandoras Box is guarded by some silly CGI creatures that delight in pulverizing human flesh. Of course Reiss catches up to Lara and although he keeps talking about killing her and pointing guns at her head he somehow never gets around to doing it. Call it the ""Talking Killer"" syndrome. The whole movie is kind of a blur - one long unending descent into frequent watch-checking. A few things stand out. First of all no matter what the situation someone has a bad line of dialogue for it. Thus we have this memorable gem to immortalize alongside ""Well always have Paris"" and ""Frankly my dear I dont give a damn"" - ""You can break my wrist but Im still going to kiss you"" What style What wit Then theres the scene where Lara tangles with a shark. As its closing in for the kill she punches it in the nose causing it to turn tail and swim away. Too bad Quint didnt know about this method of shark repellant in Jaws. Once Jan de Bont directed Speed a taut thriller about a bus that couldnt drop below 50 mph. As ridiculous as the concept was it worked in large part because of de Bonts direction. More recently however he has helmed Speed 2 and The Haunting. But Tomb Raider The Cradle of Life represents a new low. This is a clumsy clunking motion picture that owes its failure as much to de Bont as to the screenwriters. How is it possible to have more than one-half dozen major action sequences and for none of them to generate any surge of adrenaline? And why is The Cradle of Life so long? In part because de Bont leaves too much in that should have been cut. And in part because 75% of the action scenes are filmed in slow motion. I felt like I was watching ""The Six Million Dollar Man."" And I thought Bad Boys II overused the technique. At this point its probably moot to argue about whether Tomb Raider The Cradle of Life is the worst action movie of the summer. I liked Bad Boys II a little less but making the comparison is like distinguishing between a cow turd and a horse turd. And that pretty much sums it up nicely.
