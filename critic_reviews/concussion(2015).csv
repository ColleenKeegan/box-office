EntertainmentMovies Concussion doesnt hit hard enough Originally published December 29 2015 at 1158 am Updated December 29 2015 at 1224 pm Will Smith portrays Dr. Bennet Omalu (Smith) in ""Concussion."" (Melinda Sue Gordon/photo credit Melinda Sue Gordon) ""Concussion"" Movie about the Nigerian doctor who connected football with brain damage is too soft and gooey for its own good. 2.5 stars out of 4. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic Its not hard to see if you squint the movie that Peter Landesmans well-intentioned ""Concussion"" is trying to be. Substitute Big Tobacco for the NFL Russell Crowe (in one of his finest performances) for Will Smith and Michael Manns creative flourishes for Landesmans bland competence and there it is -- 1999s ""The Insider."" Two movies both about a whistle-blower in an industry thats eager to cover up any dangers; two fascinating stories only one of which translates into a truly electric movie. Its too bad ""Concussion"" certainly had the potential. Its the based-on-fact story of Dr. Bennet Omalu (Smith) a Nigerian immigrant and forensic neuropathologist who was among the first to definitively connect football with severe brain damage caused by repetitive head injury. In the film we see him speaking softly to the corpses on whom he performs autopsies fascinated by the brain -- and by the anomalies that he finds in the brain of a former professional football player who struggled with dementia in middle age. But this compelling discovery met with resistance by the NFL gets cluttered up in Landesmans telling too much gooey music an unnecessary romantic subplot (and a waste of Gugu Mbatha-Raw whose talents deserve far better than the generic girlfriend/wife role she gets here) and a sense that perhaps this story is being told too late. Smith is fine in a quiet controlled performance but the most truly memorable element here is the numbers that appear on screen before the final credits About 28 percent of all NFL players according to the leagues own actuaries are expected to develop long-term cognitive problems. The movie murmurs when it -- and others -- should be shouting.

Brad Wheeler The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Dec. 24 2015 1200AM EST Last updated Thursday Dec. 24 2015 1200AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Peter Landesman Written by Peter Landesman Starring Will Smith Gugu Mbatha-Raw Albert Brooks Classification 14A Genre drama Year 2015 Country USA Language English In the old television series Quincy M.E. which ran on NBC from 1976 to 1983 Jack Klugmans titular scrubs-wearing forensic pathologist was resolute and meticulous with strong principles and an earnestness that often rubbed his stuffy paper-pushing superior the wrong way. Every episode it seemed Quincy and his boss butted horns but the thing of it was Quincys instincts were always right. I mean every time. In Concussion a melodramatic but compelling enough lab-coat drama about football players and the pathological implications of too many blows to their heads Will Smith is a forensic neuropathologist who discovers that repeated brain bruises can (and did and do) lead to a condition called chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CET) which involves a buildup of proteins inside the skull that can cause severe dementia.The movie is true (with requisite Hollywood embellishments compositing and omissions) based in part on a 2009 GQ article by Jeanne Marie Laskas. Smiths character is Dr. Bennet Omalu an extraordinarily educated Nigerian immigrant whose painstaking and unorthodox methods infuriate his supervisor. Indeed Dr. Omalu is quite the quirky coroner He talks to the dead only uses scalpels once listens to Teddy Pendergrass on his headphones while harvesting organs and stubbornly orders expensive tests when others wouldnt bother.Based in Pittsburgh Dr. Omalu - he constantly corrects people who fail to address him with the proper honorific; the lack of respect is a sore spot with him - is assigned to examine the corpse of Mike Webster a legendary football warrior of the citys Steelers. He died in an awful state and is played strikingly by the always-good David Morse. We see the retired offensive lineman demented living in a truck and pleading to his doctor for help. He superglues his teeth inhales god knows what and electroshocks himself to sleep.And when he dies of cardiac arrest Dr. Omalus annoying boss doesnt want the citys beloved footballer cut open. But the doctor himself insists. ""I know how he died"" he says. ""I want to know why.""The why is the newly minted CET and Dr. Omalu (with help from some and the discouragement of others) gets his discovery published in a medical journal. Turns out other players suffered from the same condition causing delusions and depression that led in some cases to suicide. Confronted with the evidence that its game was killing its former players do you think the billion-dollar league embraces Dr. Omalus scientific conclusions? Lets just say that when the good doctors findings make their way to the press it is absolutely done without the expressed written consent of the National Football League which apparently studied Big Tobacco when it came to stonewalling science and denying responsibility.From there the film (directed by Peter Landesman whose often riveting historical drama Parkland examined the frenzied aftermath of the JFK assassination) documents the struggle of the strong-willed doctor to bring his results to light against the NFLs steadfast efforts to bury them. There is little doubt that when this film opens on Dec. 25 the NFL which never met a public relations challenge it couldnt bungle will be vilified once again.For all the talk of Smiths strong performance one wonders if the subject matter couldnt have been tackled with less sentimentality and heartfelt biography.Albert Brooks is his usual charismatic (and bald-cap-rocking) self as Dr. Omalus mentor. He warns his protege of the leagues power and special place in Americas heart ""The NFL owns a day of the week. The same day the Church used to own."" But a sidebar love story involving a fellow earnest African emigre (played by Gugu Mbatha-Raw) is just a fluffy distraction. They tell each other that to be Americans they need to be the ""best versions of themselves."" Their religious drivel is just bothersome.In a crisp accent that means that everything that comes out of his mouth must be true Smiths Dr. Omalus says that while in Africa he believed that Americans were the ""manifestation of what God wants us to be."" Little did he know that Americans worship different things than he does. On any given Sunday football players are sacrificed and a desperate against-the-odds play is called a ""Hail Mary."" Hut-hut amen you bet.

The movie releases in U.S. theaters on Dec. 25 2015. (Melinda Sue Gordon/Columbia Pictures via AP)(Photo Melinda Sue Gordon / AP)Just in time for the NFL playoffs here comes ""Concussion"" a movie that will hopefully give many serious pause about our nations most popular sport.Based on a true story Will Smith plays Dr. Bennet Omalu a Nigerian-born hyper-motivated coroner working in Pittsburgh. He treats the dead bodies he examines as his patients carefully trying to determine the cause of their deaths.One day hes assigned the body of a local legend a former Pittsburgh Steeler and NFL hall-of-famer named Mike Webster (David Morse) a man who went from the pinnacles of success to living in a broken-down truck. Omalu notices something inconsistent with Websters brain and against the protests of a fellow coroner and Steeler fan (Mike OMalley) decides to run some sophisticated tests paying for them with his own money.With the backing of his no-nonsense boss (Albert Brooks) Omalu determines that Webster suffered a litany of concussions over his career which eventually led to his erratic irrational behavior. Some animals skulls come equipped with insulation to protect against hard hits; human skulls have no such insulation. Omalu comes to discover that a great many football players have had similar problems and other inexplicable deaths have occurred.Thus begins Omalus fight first to be taken seriously by the scientific community (not so hard) then by the NFL (nearly impossible). Helping him along the way is a remorseful former team doctor for the Steelers (Alec Baldwin) and the widows of other NFL players whose husbands brains Omalu examines finding they line up right with Websters.""Concussion"" spends too much time on Omalus relationship with his future wife (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) and could have made its point more quickly. But that sobering point is made even though the film takes care to relish the beauty of football as well. Beautiful or not were all cheering for something that can kill people.TLongdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/toomuchTomLongConcussionGRADE BRated PG-13 for thematic material including some disturbing images and languageRunning time 123 minutesCONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1YFGyUJ MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/12/25/concussion-movie-review-will-smith-football-injuries/77891138/,200,concussion(2015)2,concussion(2015),detroitnews
"Concussion | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; concussion ) Concussion (United States 2015) December 24 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli Regarding a concussion as a serious brain injury is a relatively recent phenomenon. For many years ""getting your bell rung"" (as the expression goes) was something people were expected to shrug off. For sports the fix was to take a couple Aspirin and get back on the field. This attitude led to a whole generation of football players who long after their gladiatorial days were over developed symptoms of what would become known as CTE (Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy). When Dr. Bennet Omalu (Will Smith) discovered CTE while performing an autopsy on former Pittsburgh Steelers center Mike Webster (David Morse) his findings rocked the sports world. Only after many years of Big Tobacco-like denials was the NFL forced to acknowledge the dangers of concussions and implement ""protocols"" to address (however imperfectly) the associated health issues. The problem is fundamental as long as there is football there will be concussions and as long as there are concussions the danger of CTE lurks. Concussion doesnt have an answer to this conundrum. Over the course of about two hours Omalu identifies the disease and its root cause but short of banning football (something that will never happen) there isnt a solution. In a recent New York Times op-ed the real-life Omalu stated that he doesnt believe anyone under 18 should be permitted to play high-impact contact sports. To the extent that the film directed by Peter Landesman after having been helped to the screen by Ridley Scott explores the research that has led Omalu to take this extreme position its a fascinating and compelling piece of drama. Concussions problems however lie in its unwillingness to follow Spotlights approach and focus on the procedural aspects of the story. Inferior extraneous elements - Omalus romance with his eventual wife Prema (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) and a rivalry with a fellow pathologist - clog up the narrative and reduce the movie to a generic man-against-the-system struggle. Will Smith gives his all in a role that requires him to undergo a subtle physical transformation adopt a credible Nigerian accent and provide a controlled modulated performance. Its an effective portrayal although whether its Oscar-worthy has yet to be determined. Theres also subtle irony at work here. Next to football the sport with the highest incidence of CTE is boxing and in a previous part Smith played one of the worlds best known champions of that sport Mohammed Ali. Although this is primarily a one-man show some familiar names show up to provide Smith with solid support. Albert Brooks (as Dr. Cyril Wecht) and Alec Baldwin (Dr. Julian Bailes) play the two doctors who stand side-by-side with Omalu and absorb some of the missiles flung at him. Although David Morse playing the CTE-impaired Webster doesnt have a large amount of screen time his performance illustrates the effects of CTE. The only obvious miscasting is Luke Wilson as Roger Goodell. Wilson looks nothing like the NFL commissar and his portrayal is flat. Concussions dramatic core is solid and its unwillingness to sugarcoat the NFLs tactics is likely to raise some eyebrows. When it comes to how the league employed a campaign of disinformation bullying and obfuscation to protect their product at the cost of human lives and health theyre not much different from tobacco or asbestos companies. Concussion argues that it wasnt just a case of the NFL sticking its head in the sand but that it actively worked against Omalu demonizing his efforts and defaming him. When Concussion stays on point its as riveting as any movie about a crusader taking on a massive corrupt organization. But Concussion has about 15 minutes of material that appears to have been fused into the script in a failed attempt to make the lead character more human. Had these scenes been better written they might have worked but they feel like they were co-opted from a made-for-TV biopic. They distract rather than enhance. On balance however Concussion is to be congratulated. Landesman appears not to have been intimidated by the Teflon giant hes targeting and the movie makes valid points about how corporate greed will always trump the concern for peoples safety and well-being. Concussion isnt always brilliant but its compelling enough that the lesser scenes are easily ignored.

"Review Hard-hitting Concussion may have tried to tackle a bit too much - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Hard-hitting Concussion may have tried to tackle a bit too much Will Smith is Dr. Bennet Omalu in Concussion Columbia Pictures Will Smith is Dr. Bennet Omalu in a scene from Columbia Pictures ""Concussion."" Will Smith is Dr. Bennet Omalu in a scene from Columbia Pictures ""Concussion."" (Columbia Pictures) Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter Both intentionally and otherwise ""Concussion"" is a troubling film.As the story of Dr. Bennet Omalu a Nigerian-born forensic pathologist who was key to discovering a link between playing football concussions and a brain disease called chronic traumatic encephalopathy or CTE that can cause dementia and even death ""Concussion"" is in part a clarion call to the NFL to clean up its act (something the league has apparently begun to do) after some high-profile fatalities. More than that ""Concussion"" is a warning to parents who might be worried about their gridiron-inclined offspring that as Omalu puts it ""God did not intend for us to play football."" Adds a colleague ""If 10% of mothers feel football is too dangerous its over.""SIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter gt;gt; While the debate among experts over ""Concussions"" scientific stance has already begun thats inevitable in a film that (unlike Steve James potent 2012 documentary on the same subject ""Head Games"") has chosen to present things in narrative form. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story From a movie point of view however the key problem is that writer-director Peter Landesman has pushed too hard to make this story fit into a dramatic mold alternating melodrama and romance with those earnest warnings in a way that is more ungainly than effective.For ""Concussion"" is not just a warning to parents and athletes its also a star vehicle for Will Smith as the crusading Omalu. Its a performance African accent and all that reminds us after some less-than-convincing recent roles how charming and charismatic a performer Smith can be. But the plot elements that have to be included to make the film suitable to an actor of his magnitude fit awkwardly with its other purposes. Doctor behind Concussion tackled racism and NFL Josh Rottenberg At first glance Dr. Bennet Omalu seems an unlikely subject for a major studio movie. A Nigerian-born forensic pathologist Omalu worked for years in quiet obscurity performing autopsies at the Allegheny County Coroners Office in Pittsburgh -- hardly the kind of resume that would normally attract... At first glance Dr. Bennet Omalu seems an unlikely subject for a major studio movie. A Nigerian-born forensic pathologist Omalu worked for years in quiet obscurity performing autopsies at the Allegheny County Coroners Office in Pittsburgh -- hardly the kind of resume that would normally attract... (Josh Rottenberg) Omalu is introduced testifying as an expert witness in a murder case wearing his numerous degrees and enormous knowledge lightly as he explains his passion for finding out why people die. Later watching him do autopsies for the Allegheny County coroners office in Pittsburg we can tell that the good doctor is no ordinary physician. For one thing he likes to throw his instruments away after each autopsy and for another he asks the spirit of the dead to assist him. ""I cant do this alone"" he whispers to the corpse in question. ""I need your help to tell the world what happened to you.""Those attitudes raise lots of eyebrows in the workplace but Omalu has the backing of his boss Allegheny County Coroner Dr. Cyril Wecht (an effective Albert Brooks). As things develop hes going to need it because though he knows almost nothing about American football Omalu ends up doing the autopsy on Hall of Fame Pittsburgh Steeler center Mike Webster.As weve seen at ""Concussions"" opening Webster (played by David Morse) has been slowly going crazy for years. ""Youve got to fix this"" he screams at former Steelers team physician Dr. Julian Bailes (Alec Baldwin) but death comes before any fix is possible and the cause of death is in Omalus hands.After ordering numerous tests including some he paid for himself Omalu comes to believe that the head banging and concussions that Webster sustained during his career damaged his brain in much the same way that the blows to the head that boxers sustain can make them what used to be called punch-drunk.As ""Concussion"" goes on other NFL players are shown to be having similar mental breakdowns and deaths including Andre Waters (Richard T. Jones) and Justin Strzelczyk (Matthew Willig). Omalu gets access to their brains and says they too were suffering from CTE.Naturally the NFL is not pleased to hear about this ignoring Omalus findings at first and then demanding a retraction. Even though the doctor has misgivings about what Wecht characterizes as ""going to war with a corporation that owns a day of the week"" his passion for the truth makes him persevere.All this is certainly involving but it fits awkwardly with a completely different strand of the film that extensively details the growing romance between Omalu and a beautiful young Kenyan woman named Prema Musito (""Belles"" Gugu Mbatha-Raw) who his church has improbably asked him to take in as a boarder.Also sounding a jarring note is the films willingness to hint without coming out and saying it that NFL retaliation reached such ogre-like proportions that it led to federal prosecution against Omalus mentor Wecht and even to shadowy people following Musito and causing terrible damage.Ordinarily departures from reality are perfectly acceptable for factually based drama. But it would be nice if a film that wants to influence real-world decisions by having us believe its telling the absolute truth about the dangers of concussions held itself to a similar high standard of truth in all areas of plot. But that may be too much to ask.kenneth.turanlatimes.com------------ConcussionMPAA rating PG-13 for thematic material including some disturbing images and language.Running time 2 hours 3 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times A version of this article appeared in print on December 25 2015 in the Entertainment section of the Los Angeles Times with the headline ""Trying to tackle a bit too much - The collision of drama with a societal message in `Concussion proves jarring - REVIEW"" -- Todays paperTodays paper | Subscribe Reviews Movies Entertainment NFL Alzheimers Disease Will Smith (football) Pittsburgh Steelers Was the Will Smith-starring Concussion softened to appease the NFL?

(  / Sony Pictures) After a string of forgettable films (""After Earth"" ""Focus"") Will Smith is back on his game with ""Concussion"" snagging a Golden Globe nomination for his portrayal of real-life neuropathologist Bennet Omalu. Omalu a Nigerian immigrant was an unknown Allegheny County Pa. coroner until performing an autopsy on former Pittsburgh Steelers center Mike Webster when he made a discovery that few wanted to hear. The injuries to Websters brain -- corroborated by examination of other deceased football players a disturbing number of whom had shown signs of early dementia and erratic behavior -- suggested the existence of a new disease resulting from on-field head butting chronic traumatic encephalopathy or CTE. The NFL had another acronym for Omalus conclusion BS. [For Concussion doctor the spotlight only gets brighter] ""Concussion"" was adapted for the screen by director Peter Landesman (""Parkland"") from a buzzy GQ article by Jeanne Marie Laskas. Smartly the drama opens not by focusing on the scientific but on the emotional side of the story and the agonizing breakdown of ""Iron Mike"" Webster who helped lead the Steelers to four Super Bowl victories in the 1970s. Toward the end of his life as portrayed by David Morse Webster was perpetually confused living out of his pickup truck. His off-putting habits included applying Super Glue to his rotting teeth and using a taser on himself. He died alone in 2002. While the media and masses are writing off the Hall of Famer as a sad curious case of misspent fame and fortune Smiths Omalu decides to get to the bottom of Websters end-of-life spiral. Although the official cause of death is listed as a heart attack Omalu orders more tests paying for them himself. His findings reveal that Websters 50-year-old brain bears striking similarities to those of much older Alzheimers patients. Almost as quickly as Omalu can publish his findings the NFL sets about discrediting the doctor and his work. Its all nonsense according to spokesmen for the multibillion-dollar sports league. Just like that a likeable soft- spoken David has found his Goliath. Will Smith as Dr. Bennet Omalu in ""Concussion."" (Columbia Pictures) Smith renders Omalu as a pious if quirky genius one who talks to cadavers and decorates the rearview mirror of his Mercedes with a cross. His life revolves around his work until he meets a Kenyan immigrant Prema (Gugu Mbatha-Raw). Premas presence in the film allows the character of Omalu to convey to the audience his newly conflicted feelings about America which used to seem like an earthly paradise he explains. But once the NFL begins to wage war on the doctor -- enlisting football fans as foot soldiers who ambush him with threatening phone calls -- hes not so sure about his adopted home. As Omalu Smith gives an emotional performance bolstered by capable supporting players. Albert Brooks is especially good as Omalus wry boss and chief advocate Cyril Wecht lightening the films otherwise gloomy mood. The themes in ""Concussion"" mirror those of another awards contender. In ""Spotlight"" a relentless group of muckraking journalists takes on another powerful organization the Catholic Church. If that drama proves anything its that a great story doesnt need to be overdramatized. ""Concussion"" on the other hand is a little more heavy- handed especially in its handling of the narrative of a put-upon immigrant losing faith in the American dream. That thread only serves to overshadow a far more troubling story one about the NFLs stop-at-nothing smear campaign and how easily the public bought into it. PG-13. At area theaters. Contains some disturbing images and strong language. 123 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Corporate malfeasance takes a potent uppercut on the chin in ""Concussion."" This fact-based medical procedural whistle-blows reprehensible front office deceptions by the National Football League with earnest honesty just as ""The Big Short"" indicts unethical mortgage brokers and ""Spotlight"" exposes corrupt officials in the Catholic church. We are in a golden era of intelligent films dramatizing true stories of power and corruption that we have a moral obligation to understand. At the center of the story is forensic neuropathologist Dr. Bennet Omalu a polite soft-spoken Nigerian immigrant performing analytical autopsies in the Pittsburgh morgue. Will Smith gives a solid performance as Omalu a devout Christian who addresses his deceased wards with gentle remarks that would soothe living patients. The mild-mannered M.D. becomes the storys David unaware that he is about to tackle a very wrathful Goliath. As a child growing up in Nigeria becoming an American was an ideal. ""You could be anything you could do anything"" Smith says in a lilting accent. ""I never wanted anything as much as I wanted to be an American."" The film begins in 2002 as ""Iron Mike"" Webster a mentally ill Pittsburgh Steeler great (chillingly played by David Morse) is found dead a ruined man at age 50. For nearly two decades he played bone-crunching football winning adoring fans in Three Rivers Stadium as he faced human battering rams playing on for 15 years despite growing injuries and illness. His retirement was a tragic downward spiral of depression rage and homeless drug addiction. Omalus office receives the body and after an examination the researcher suspects that football-related head-on collisions caused a neurodegenerative disease. Omalu expands his inquiry to similar cases involving suicides by former gridiron stars proving that repeated assaults to the head triggered chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The courteous doctor believes the sports executives must be safety-conscious gentlemen eager to scale back the violent sports combat that threatens their athletes. What he did not realize was that the NFL running the business not to save lives but to make billions each year would stop at nothing to threaten and discredit him. The league had long insisted that its own doctors -- with degrees unrelated to neuroscience -- reject such claims arguing that many players experienced early-onset Alzheimers or dementia. Undeterred Omalu keeps pressing winning the support of the Steelers former team physician Dr. Julian Bailes (Alec Baldwin) who knows that Omalu whose mantra is simply ""tell the truth"" is doing just that. ""Concussion"" is a decent but uneven film. Writer/director Peter Landesman focuses on Omalus personal life more than a thriller requires. When the scandal should hold center stage the movies focus turns too often to his charming midlife courtship and marriage to a woman who appreciates the strength and beauty of the sport. Some charges appearing to be linked to NFL dirty work (an FBI probe of Omalus supportive boss a possible car pursuit connected to a sad mishap) are presented unconvincingly. Concussion  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for thematic material including some disturbing images and language. CAROL  out of 4 stars Rated R for a scene of sexuality/nudity and brief language. Theater Edina. Its greatest strength is its scrutiny of an issue the NFL didnt admit until last year. Settling with 5000 former players who sued the league the NFLs federal court documents predicted that nearly a third of retired players will face long-term cognitive disease. A drama about the meaning of corruption and citizenship doesnt improve by being softened with romantic issues and questionable accusations. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

"Concussion (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Concussion (PG-13) Will Smith stars as a pathologist who uncovers a troubling pattern among professional football players. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle cogleMiamiHerald.com12/24/2015 Editor rating 3 Like The Big Short Concussion takes a serious timely and important topic -- in this case the discovery of the progressive degenerative brain disease debilitating professional football players -- and builds a movie around it. Unlike The Big Short which uses a variety of cinematic tricks to tell its story of the mortgage crisis Concussion based on Jeanne Marie Laskas GQ article ""Brain Game"" follows a more straightforward safe typically Hollywood path. But the film doesnt need artifice to get across its message on the dangers of concussions. If it doesnt dramatically alter the way you view the game youre willfully refusing to pay attention. Will Smith stars as Dr. Bennet Omalu the forensic pathologist who discovers what will eventually be termed chronic traumatic encephalopathy after an autopsy of former Pittsburgh Steeler Mike Webster whose life after football spiraled into homelessness and dementia (he was living in his truck by the end of his life). That Omalu works in Pittsburgh is a crucial point The city lives for the sport and celebrates its hard-hitting history in a nonstop black and gold frenzy. But Omalu cant let go of what he saw in Websters autopsy. Then another Steeler Justin Strzelczyk is killed after a pattern of erratic behavior (he crashes his car into a tanker truck). More cases follow and as Omalu continues his investigation and ultimately pinpoints the cause of CTE -- the head-banging collisions that professional football and its fans demand -- he grows more and more determined to publicize his findings. Hes eventually joined in his quest by Dr. Julian Bailes (Alec Baldwin) who worked with the Steelers and is weary of seeing terrible things happen to his friends. Director/screenwriter Peter Landesman builds a solid dramatic story around this premise and Smith delivers a terrific award-worthy performance as Omalu nailing his Nigerian accent his intelligence his determination to do what he knows is right. As his love interest Gugu Mbatha-Raw (Belle) does her best with a role that seems to exist largely to put a female presence in the film. Still women do have an important role in the future of this story One NFL official points out that if even 10 percent of the women in America decided their sons shouldnt play football the sport is doomed. Would you let your kid play this violent game? Concussion leaves some vital and intriguing avenues unexplored. Landesman does not let the NFL off the hook -- the league and its commissioners come off as real villains who care only about the bottom line and not the lives that are being ruined. But Landesman never bothers to explore the economic and racial components of the game and who plays it nor does he explore our own responsibility as fans. The NFL is a moneymaking monster Americas game. What Concussion effectively asks us to consider is this How many ruined lives will it take to make a change?

Will Smiths NFL drama does justice to the genre of whistle-blowing films through its fearlessness Movies about corporate truth-tellers loom large in the American landscape. Serpico Silkwood Erin Brockovich The Insider--watching cinematic Davids warn about out-of-control Goliaths has undeniable force. Theres one big force the National Football League trying to stop Dr. Bennet Omalu (Will Smith) from blowing a whistle in Concussion a true-life drama thats as surprisingly brave as it is gripping. After Omalu a Pittsburgh forensic neuropathologist dissects the brain of recently deceased 50-year-old football hall of famer Mike Webster (David Morse) he discovers specific proteins present that likely led to the retired stars madness and death--and which Omalu believes were caused by the repeated head impact Webster endured on the field. Autopsies of other ex-NFL-ers back up the theory and soon Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy or CTE as Omalu names the disease riles an angry football league. But Omalu presses on aided by NFL neurological consultant Dr. Julian Bailes (Alec Baldwin) and becomes ever more worried that a preventable tragedy is literally playing out in front of millions of fans. Writer-director Peter Landesmann intercuts Omalus building an argument about a major entertainment industrys negligence with his building a home with Prema (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) and she and Bailes voice what feels like an obligatory counter-argument. ""This game is beautiful"" Prema says at one point while Bailes waxes about its appeal ""Its incredibly violent ... and then suddenly its Shakespeare."" But thats the extent of the equal time the NFL gets and Concussion is stronger for keeping such pronouncements to a minimum. Omalu--a man of faith who quirkily asks the corpses he works on for help so he can ""tell their story""--has belief in what he sees in his lab and his calm multiple-medical-degreed logic anchors the story. Smith tamps down his charisma to portray a courtly cerebral and compelling man of science; Omalu is an Nigerian immigrant who loves America but is shocked at its willingness to be blindsided. As Smith bows his head to listen or sits mystified as NFL reps state how his expertise doesnt trump bought-and-paid-for research his eyes fill with something between pity and disgust The former players whose histories haunt Omalu mean more to him dead than they did to the NFL alive. In addition to Gugu Mbatha-Raws astute confidante Baldwins gruff loyal insider and Morses sad lost soul is Albert Brooks as Omalus boss and Eddie Marsan as a skeptical expert. (Luke Wilson has a brief moment as NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell presiding over a committee hearing.) In the midst of an ongoing debate Concussion takes a side but its not bullheaded nor is it fearful. Like the best films of its genre it knows veracity is the best defense.

VPCWill Smith is good as the doctor who discovered the brain trauma plaguing NFL players but Peter Landesmans film gets bogged down with unnecessary distractions.Will Smith stars in Columbia Pictures ""Concussion.""(Photo Columbia Pictures)Story HighlightsCritics rating 3 stars out of 5Will Smith doesnt overplay the role and he is effectiveWhen it sticks to issues ""Concussion"" is good but the film gets distracted with a romantic subplot""Concussion"" is perhaps fittingly a confused film one that cant decide whether it wants to be a message movie about a hot-topic issue or a somewhat softer look at a man apart fighting for what he believes in while (swoon) falling in love.So director Peter Landesman tries to settle for both with mixed results. Will Smith acting again for a change (as opposed to just Being a Big Star or taking on vanity projects that his kids can appear in) is good at both things. But hes much better served as the hard-charging agent of change than the out-of-his-element would-be boyfriend a side plot that stops the movie cold every time it appears and it appears fairly often.Too bad. Brain injuries among football players are at the forefront of discussion about the National Football League with an alarming number of players suffering from chronic traumatic encephalopathy or CTE as a result of violent collisions. Memory loss violent behavior off the field even suicides cast a haunting shadow over the most popular sport in the U.S. At its best ""Concussion"" takes an unflinching look at the cost of the game.AZCENTRALFallerAt its worst Smith finds a girlfriend.He plays Dr. Bennet Omalu a brilliant pathologist from Nigeria credentialed to the gills working in a Pittsburgh morgue doing autopsies. Think of Beethoven playing the organ at the roller rink and youll have the idea.Omalu doesnt watch football (he has a television but doesnt turn it on). So when Hall of Famer Mike Webster a hero of the great Pittsburgh Steeler teams shows up on a slab he doesnt recognize the importance of the great player or the impact his death has on the football-mad city. Webster (movingly played by David Morse) inexplicably lost his mind and wound up living in a truck while pulling his own teeth and then trying to super-glue them back into his mouth.Alec Baldwin and Will Smith co-star in ""Concussion."" (Photo Columbia Pictures)Why? In Pittsburgh it was practically blasphemous even to ask (a view held by a colleague) but Omalu about as outside as an outsider could be wants answers. He orders tests and then more tests even when he has to pay for them himself. He has a sympathetic boss Cyril Wecht (Albert Brooks great always) but hes still swimming upstream. When Omalu concludes that Webster and others are suffering serious brain problems as a result of collisions in football he names the trauma CTE. Then he publishes a paper in a medical journal and waits for a presumably grateful NFL to start cleaning things up.Not quite.AZCENTRALYear in Review 2015 Goodykoontzs top 10 moviesThe league is not thrilled at findings that could potentially affect its all-important bottom line and is depicted as a kind of all-powerful Mafia of sport. (""THEY OWN A DAY"" Wecht says in exactly the exasperated tone you would expect from Brooks and its terrific.) NFL doctors and officials belittle Omalus findings and the FBI raids Wechts office although -- and this is a real narrative problem -- its unclear whether the NFL was behind it. Only Julian Bailes (Alec Baldwin) the former Steelers team doctor buys into what Omalu is claiming.At this point the film slips into standard outsider-standing-up-for-what-he-knows-is-right mode. When its not being a romance. Omalu meets Prema Mutiso (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) at church and Landesman (who wrote the script based on Jeanne Marie Laskas GQ article) mostly uses their relationship as a cutesy attempt at humanizing Omalu. (Prema watches TV for instance so Omalu eventually can too.) Its a distraction the movie doesnt need. Were already solidly in Omalus camp. Hes obviously brilliant but also quirky (he talks to the dead as if theyre alive asking them for help with his autopsies) and while he becomes frustrated he doesnt give up.AZCENTRALConcussion (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsOh wait it looks like theyre going to kiss.Smiths performance in which he resists the urge to go over the top and the subject matter make ""Concussion"" an interesting movie but not the urgent one it could have been.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

VPCMike OMalley (from left) Albert Brooks and Will Smith star in Concussion.(Photo Melinda Sue Gordon)Concussion digs into the trenches of pigskin warfare and creates a timely quasi-thriller.Directed by Peter Landesman (Parkland) the movie (1/2; rated PG-13; opens nationwide Christmas Day) features Will Smith in his most transformative role as Bennet Omalu a real-life forensic pathologist whose work investigating brain damage in pro football players lines him up opposite the NFL.Landesman raises headline-making questions about a favored pastime yet the movie loses some of its potential by switching focus to Omalus personal life and away from the core matter.The opening of Concussion centers on beloved Pittsburgh Steelers lineman Mike Webster (David Morse). When hes found dead in his truck in 2002 Omalu is on duty in the morgue and sees oddities in Websters brain that shouldnt be there with a 50-year-old.USA TODAYWill Smith shows painful reality in ConcussionHis research into other football players who died young and had problems with drugs and personal issues proves fruitful in diagnosing this disease as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). When the medical world at large begins to pay attention Omalu and those around him are put in the crosshairs of the powerful NFL.The cast is a stellar one especially Smith. Not only does he capture Omalus Nigerian accent and mannerisms but also the characters idiosyncrasies. This is a man who cares much more about humans than football and its touching to watch how he whispers to a dead man on a slab and asks to find out what is wrong. ""If I know how someone lived I know how someone died"" Omalu explains to one of his critics (there are a few).Albert Brooks is scene-stealingly good as Omalus boss and ardent supporter Alec Baldwin and Eddie Marsan are top notch as other doctors who become involved in Omalus efforts and Morse is quite moving as Webster puffy and suffering but still trying to as he says ""finish the game.""USA TODAYWill Smith saw dead people filming ConcussionGugu Mbatha-Raw co-stars as Omalus love interest Prema and though it grounds the main character to see him marry her and want to have children it slows the momentum of the main plot. What does work is seeing how Omalus work negatively affects his home life to a degree.Headed by Roger Goodell (Luke Wilson in an oddly enigmatic role) the NFL is painted as a shadowy villain but football itself isnt portrayed as overtly negative -- in fact the beauty of the sport is pointed out by multiple characters. Plus Landesman shows the science of CTE and its effect on players in a striking way.Despite its faults Smiths excellent execution and Concussion on the whole will hit home in the hearts and especially minds of the audience. 38 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 6 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1YCcE3O",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/12/23/review-concussion-will-smith/77749344/,200,concussion(2015)11,concussion(2015),usatoday

Comments click to enlarge Concussion Video Rated PG-13  121 minutes  2015 An experienced investigative journalist writer-director Peter Landesman (Parkland Kill the Messenger) brings a responsible approach to his politically fraught stories which comes in handy with this expose of brain trauma in pro football. Based on a GQ article by Jeanne Marie Laskas the film tells the story of Dr. Bennet Omalu a forensic pathologist in Pittsburgh who took on the National Football League with his 2005 paper asserting that legendary Pittsburgh Steelers center Mike Webster had suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (brain degeneration caused by repeated blows to the head). Will Smith gives an ingratiating performance as the comically egotistical but passionately idealistic doctor and theres strong work from Alec Baldwin as a former NFL physician counseling Omalu and the ever-reliable David Morse as Webster. Less impressive is Albert Brooks whose dramatic performance as Omalus supportive boss collapses under the weight of too many bad one-liners. By J.R.

Photo Melinda Sue Gordon McClatchy-Tribune News Service Concussion a corny treatment but a surefire story 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Sometimes a good story is enough and ""Concussion"" is one of those cases. In many ways its cliched in the telling old-fashioned without being classic with a sappy soundtrack and lead performances that are so intended to inspire that they almost backfire. But writer-director Peter Landesman has a fascinating and appalling story to tell here and that cuts through the layers of corniness. ""Concussion"" is the story of Dr. Bennet Omalu a Nigerian pathologist working in Pittsburgh who discovered a disease caused by football chronic traumatic encephalopathy. A natural consequence of the game it comes from multiple blows to the head and it results in motor-neuron symptoms aggression suicidal tendencies and early dementia. How early? Were not talking about 70s or even 60s which would be horrible enough. Were talking about men in their 40s losing their minds. For those of us who werent quite paying attention when this made the news a few years back and especially for parents whose teenage sons want to play football in high school (and even middle school) ""Concussion"" is a genuine public service. Its also a medical mystery tale and a saga about a decent honest scientist going up against a big-money monolith. Omalu is played by Will Smith and its difficult to know what to make of his performance here. Or rather its easy to know what to make of it but the impressions are conflicting. Smith tends to bring an insufferable radiance to his heroic roles and so he plays Omalu as something like a holy fool only brilliant. There is no shadow of darkness in his performance not even a hint that this man might someday possibly wake up in a sour mood. There is no one in the world as good as cheerful and as pure as Will Smith when instructed to play a hero. And yet ... if Smith is selling snake oil its pleasing snake oil. When he talks to each corpse before he does an autopsy (""Help me find out what happened to you; I need your help"") or when he faces down an NFL official with righteous rage (""Tell the truth"") Smith does convey an unclouded spirit. Its as if we dont believe his acting even as were affected by it so that we never forget were watching Will Smith at the same time as were really hoping things work out for Dr. Omalu. A point in favor of ""Concussion"" is that it sticks close to the truth unlike some recent fact-based films (""Suffragette"" ""Trumbo"" ""Steve Jobs""). The NFL players who suffer and end up on Omalus autopsy table are real people such as the former Pittsburgh Steelers center Mike Webster (David Morse) who went through a hell of torment before his death at age 50 in 2002. Omalu against the resistance of colleagues but with the backing of an enlightened boss kept studying Websters case until he made his discoveries. As the nice boss Albert Brooks is almost as saintly as Smith though at least with Brooks we can watch in hope that another shoe might drop. Gugu Mbatha-Raw plays Prema a nurse from Kenya who provides Omalu with emotional support when he needs it. I suppose playing opposite Will Smith in a Christmas Day release would be considered a step up for Mbatha-Raw. But after seeing her on fire in two films last year ""Beyond the Lights"" and ""Belle"" its a comedown to watch her spirit domesticated into the routine girlfriend archetype. If ""Concussion"" is your introduction to this actress you still havent seen her. That Omalu is an immigrant gives ""Concussion"" an interesting extra angle. Coming from the outside he just assumes that the NFL will welcome his findings and make proper adjustments (perhaps such as shutting down altogether). He has no idea what hes dealing with but we do and the films presentation of the NFL not as the guardians of Americas game but as something almost akin to the tobacco industry is unexpected and refreshing.

Theres a snippet of Hall of Fame lineman Mike Webster before he became a suicidal shell of a man. Theres an ESPN reel showing one bone-rattling tackle after another as the broadcasters cackle with glee.Americas favorite sport has never felt so sinister. If ""Concussion were a murder mystery it wouldnt take long to nab the suspect.""Playing football killed Mike Webster Dr. Bennet Omalu played by Will Smith says early in the film. Will Smith as Dr. Bennet Omalu in Concussion. (Columbia Pictures) ( Columbia Pictures ) Casting the beloved game as the villain comes at a price for Omalu and for the otherwise satisfying ""Concussion."" Seeing the NFLs head-trauma epidemic mostly through the eyes of a forensic pathologist instead of say a star player leaves the story without many highs. ""Concussion"" has a clinical feel; its a two-hour autopsy of our Sunday afternoons.Writer/director Peter Landsman tries to provide an emotional lift with the romantic tale of Omalu and his wife Prema (Gugu Mbatha-Raw). But those scenes tend to slow the film not enhance it. Were this a football game youd treat the courtship as if it were a tire ad -- fast-forwarding through it to get back to the action.Advertisement ""Concussion"" is at its most compelling when it focuses on the more complicated love story the one between America and its dangerously violent sport.Webster was a Hall of Fame center during the Steelers dynasty of the 1970s and remained an icon in Pittsburgh for his warrior ways. But his playing career was followed by more than a decade of physical and psychological turmoil. By the end of his life at age 50 he was living in his truck using Super Glue to stick his teeth back in place and knocking himself out with a Taser gun because it was the only way he could sleep. David Morse who plays Webster captures the players wild-eyed frustration as he slides deeper into the mental abyss.Omalu dissected Websters body in a Pittsburgh coroners office in 2002 and was flabbergasted to find evidence of a degenerative brain disease usually seen only in the elderly. He concluded that Websters dementia was the result of repeated hits to the head over the course of 245 career games -- ""an unrelenting storm of sub-concussive blows"" Smith calls it in one of the movies best moments.Omalus diagnosis proved to be pivotal in our understanding of the dangers of football. The disease called chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) was later discovered in the brains of other troubled former NFL players such as Justin Strzelczyk (played by former 49ers lineman Matthew Willig) Dave Duerson (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and Andre Waters (Richard T. Jones).Omalu owns a truckload of advanced degrees and other certifications but as the movie drives home his greatest asset is his willful ignorance of NFL culture. The Nigerian immigrant cares only about the science. He plows ahead in his quest for truth without fear of retribution from a powerful and beloved institution. In that regard ""Concussion"" is not unlike the reporters taking on the Catholic Church in ""Spotlight."" Indeed a skeptic in ""Concussion"" frets ""The NFL owns a day of the week The same one the church used to own""Omalu finds an early ally in Julian Bailes (Alec Baldwin) a former Steelers team doctor who now realizes he put players like Webster in medical peril. But the rest of the NFL establishment comes down hard on the doctors findings with the old guard scrambling to discredit Omalus research in order to preserve their empire. Bailes warned him this would happen. ""You turned on the lights"" he says ""and gave their boogeyman a name.""Smith whose performance earned him a Golden Globe nomination captures Omalus blend of verve and determination. He even nails the accent. (The real doctor is featured prominently in Frontlines ""League of Denial"" documentary.) Smith is restrained but still flashes his star power; just watch his eyes after he sees signs of trouble through a microscope.Gugu Mbatha-Raw brings a sweet strength to Prema but shes the wife in the story who merits the least interest. We get only get a few nanoseconds of Keana Strzelczyk who must have watched her loving husband unravel into a homicidal madman. Waters mother gets only a line or two about the demons that claimed her son at age 44.This is where ""Concussion"" could have gone deeper. Because the family portraits are mere sketches the heartbreak feels cursory not profound. Still the film captures the essence of how an unlikely scientist forced a monumental shift in the NFL culture. ""Concussion"" gains just enough ground to score.Daniel Brown is a sportswriter for the Bay Area News Group.

But in real life you can have all of that going into a football game and still lose bad. Lose for good. ""Concussion"" is the story of a crisis in the NFL the dawning realization that - when played to hurt when played for keeps when played the way all those La-Z-Boy warriors at home want it played - football can be fatal. But mostly its about the way fans players and especially owners wanted nothing to do with that hard truth about ""Americas game."" Until a new American - an overachieving immigrant from Nigeria - politely persistently began pointing it out. In the film hes played by Will Smith who after a string of popcorn movies - not a few of which remained duds at the bottom of the bag - is back in the kind of smart sober serious work we havent really seen from him since the lovely ""The Pursuit of Happyness."" Hes very good in the part (mastering to my ears at least an African accent) but more than that he brings an essential quality of quietly formidable dignity. His Dr. Omalu is the son of a chief; he has multiple medical degrees (and ones in music and business just for fun). And yet because he is not just African-American but African - a foreigner from a poor country a man with an accent - he is dismissed ignored insulted. Every time someone talks to him they call him Mr. Every time he corrects them - Dr.He is that kind of man. And it is only that kind of man who will see this through to the end. Because it is a long fight. It begins when as a coroner in Pittsburgh Omalu autopsies a mentally ill man who had once been a famous Steeler and now lives out of his car. His town is embarrassed by how far hes fallen; theyd rather he was buried quickly and his bad ending with him. But Omalu is too soft-spokenly stubborn for that. Omalu is the sort of person who will push and push until he gets an answer which is good for him; whats bad for ""Concussion"" is that the answer comes very quickly leaving the movie nowhere to go. It goes on of course - there are various doctors (and of course NFL officials) who tell him hes wrong or stupid or un-American. But none of this is dramatically surprising or even unsurmountable. And so director Peter Landesman tries to gin it up by throwing in cheap conspiracy-movie cliches -- noises in the middle of the night cars that seem to be tailing Omalus family. (Theres also a large supporting cast including Alec Baldwin bravely wrestling with a Louisiana accent and Gugu Mbatha-Raw good but underused as Omalus new wife.) None of that convinces any more than Omalus devout Catholicism. Its not that the real man doesnt have a strong faith or that it shouldnt be part of this movie - but in Landesmans hands it seems deliberately forced into the plot and its theological underpinnings (all these people suffered it seemed just so Omalu could set things right) feels like a patronizing attempt to provide a Sunday-school moral. Smith though is very good. And the movie has one truly encouraging surprise Despite the rumors the gossip the stolen emails describing NFL ""involvement"" in this film the story - and the stinging end titles - do not let that organization off the hook. They made a lot of money off their stars this film declares and they did not care very much when they got sidelined permanently. Landesman doesnt sugarcoat that. Its a clean solid hit. Which is better than the league deserves. Ratings note The film contains violence substance abuse and strong language. Concussion (PG-13) Sony (123 min.) Directed by Peter Landesman. With Will Smith Gugu Mbatha-Raw.Opens Friday in New Jersey.   1/2 Stephen Whitty may be reached at stephenjwhittygmail.com. Follow him on Twitter stephenwhitty. Find him on Facebook.

A crushing hit on the NFL via a pro-immigration story. Director Peter Landesman (203) Rated PG-13 for thematic material including some disturbing images and language Everyone who is talking about ""Concussion"" has it wrong. Yes its a brutal indictment of football and its unspoken human cost. More news stories and movies about brain injuries from contact sports could lead parents across the country to finally give up football and follow the Park Slope path of least resistance intramural soccer. But ""Concussion"" is really about another larger hot-button issue immigration. And it centers on a deeply human performance by Will Smith who plays the Nigerian-born coroner Dr. Bennet Omalu. FORMER QB LUCAS ACTIVISTS WEIGH IN ON CONCUSSION Will Smith stars as a Nigerian-born coroner who just wants to do the right thing in ""Concussion."" (Courtesy of Columbia Pictures.) Omalu is assigned to autopsy the Hall of Fame center Mike Webster after his untimely death from dementia at age 50. Instead of a rubber-stamp job Omalu decides to perform a thorough probing expensive and slow autopsy -- even as a hostile possibly racist coworker urges him to just get on with it. MOVIE REVIEW THE REVENANT IS A GRIPPING WESTERN Alec Baldwin plays Dr. Julian Bailes whose work with Dr. Bennet Omalu (Will Smith) is dramatized in ""Concussion."" (Melinda Sue Gordon/Columbia Pictures/photo credit Melinda Sue Gordon) But Omalu receives support from his courageous boss (Albert Brooks with characteristic menschiness) who respects Omalus integrity. And thats where the films power lies. Sure Omalu takes on that most American of institutions -- the NFL -- but all he wants is what anyone wants the ability to live and work honorably and pursue happiness with his family. NFL DENIES PULLING FUNDING FOR BOSTON UNIVERSITY CTE STUDY Gugu Mbatha-Raw (with Will Smith) also stars. (Melinda Sue Gordon/photo credit Melinda Sue Gordon) When he triumphs it shows that when the best and brightest are allowed to come to these shores the nation benefits. Yes this important film will deepen a debate about the games safety. And yes it makes the National Football League look like a tobacco company run by the Nixon administration. But immigration is the ultimate political football right now -- and when I left the theater it was with a renewed sense of what one dignified man can achieve when given a chance in a great nation.

Departing from a career-long catalog of heroes Will Smith takes on his most slippery role since Six Degrees of Separation (still his best performance) as real-life brain doctor Bennet Omalu. A proudly accomplished Nigerian-born academic living in something of a prissy fog in blue-collar Pittsburgh Omalu is content to perform unrushed autopsies until the cadaver of ex-Steeler Mike Webster is wheeled into his examination room. After months of self-funded study Omalu concludes that football is a hazardous game one that needs to be stopped. The degenerative brain disease that Omalu identified chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a serious matter worthy of attention. Concussion leans hard into its somberness and if leaked Sony emails from last years cyberhack suggested studio skittishness at the possibility of a showdown with the National Football League that hasnt come to pass onscreen. The movie piles on its damning evidence slurry linebackers innocent intramural-playing kids in harms way and even Luke Wilson as the sports dead-eyed commissioner--you cant help but laugh at the stunt casting. Naturally Omalus news goes over like a lead blimp in a beaten-down town where the sport is practically a religion The chief coroner (Albert Brooks) does what he can to protect his alarmed crusader but knows that theyre encroaching on sacred ground. Concussion could have used the political backbone of Smiths Ali director Michael Mann; instead it has Peter Landesman who steers both lead actor and screenplay away from the sharper edges. A decent beautiful woman (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) comes to our heros side and even though the NFL is shown as being uncaring theres a deeper story here about racism and post-9/11 America clinging to its Sunday traditions thats barely explored.

Hes working in Pittsburgh and a Pittsburgh Steeler veteran commits suicide while living in the back of a truck.  This prompts the doctor to investigate while someone in their 50s would have such brain issues at such a relatively young age.  Once the NFL hears about his discoveries they quickly try to squash his research and anyone around him. Eventually more NFL veterans begin dying of obscure reasons and the NFL is forced to take action.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Website terms of use Contact us Get listed Advertising Time Out products Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Foursquare Time Out New York Site map },http://www.timeout.com/us/film/concussion-2015,200,concussion(2015)21,concussion(2015),timeout

And he deserves highest of  praise for playing real-life forensic pathologist Dr. Bennet Omalu a Nigerian immigrant with no knowledge of football who became the NFLs worst nightmare. Why? As an outsider in the Pittsburgh coroners office -- he infuriates co-workers by speaking gently to the bodies he dissects believing the dead have a story to tell --  the good doctor steps on important toes. More News 10 Best Movies of 2015 30 Best Sports Movies of All Time The Year of Deflategate How a Dumb Drama Ruined the NFL All Stories >> Related Will Smiths Movies Ranked Worst to Best From Bad Boys to Men in Black breaking down the big-screen highlights and low points of the Willennium He runs tests on the brain of Iron Mike Webster (a superb David Morse) the former Hall of Fame center for the Pittsburgh Steelers and finds that the head-butting Webster took on the field led to memory loss dementia and his untimely death. Naming the disorder chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) Omalu crusades to warn players pro and amateur of a condition that could not be detected until after a patients death. To Omalu getting dinged up from repeated blows to the head must cease being a source of pride for players and a way to win cheers from an ignorant crowd. Players need to know what theyre up against. Omalu gets support from his boss Cyril Wecht played by a scene-stealing wickedly wry Albert Brooks who bemoans that Sundays used to be owned by God not the NFL. And he  wins over Julian Bailes (Alec Baldwin) a former Steelers doctor seeking  redemption for sending so many concussion victims back in the game. But there are profits to protect here and the  NFL -- repped by Luke Wilson as NFL commissioner Roger Goodell -- hits back hard threatening Omalus job and his stellar reputation. Its a gripping story most devastating when we see rugged players such as Justin Strzelczyk (Matthew Willig) and Dave Duerson (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) suffer breakdowns for reasons that dont show up on brain scans.  Director Peter Landesman (Parkland) who also wrote the script undercuts it with plodding pacing endless shots of talking heads a sermonizing tone and wan interludes with Omalu and his wife Parma (a beautiful but criminally wasted Gugu Mbatha-Raw). The film goes slack when its screws most need to tighten. Luckily Smith -- flawless in accent and commitment to Omalus  worthy cause -- grips you from first to last. Hardly mandatory pre-Super Bowl viewing for football junkies. But wait. Maybe it should be.

Photo Columbia Pictures MOVIE REVIEW Concussion Running time 122 minutes. Rated PG-13 (disturbing images profanity). In 2002 Pittsburgh Steelers Hall of Fame center Mike Webster who had been living in a pickup truck was suffering from dementia and could get to sleep only by blasting himself unconscious with a Taser was found dead. The cause of death was football according to the film ""Concussion."" Will Smith plays Dr. Bennet Omalu the coroner who obsessively examined Websters corpse looking for a clue to the mans mental decay. The answer CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy) a disorder discovered by Omalu that was invisible on CT scans. Omalu concluded that repeated head trauma over a period of years was causing CTE which in turn was leading great ex-NFL players to schizophrenia depression and suicide. Smiths Omalu is an aristocratic awkwardly formal Nigerian who knows nothing of football but pursues his research at considerable cost to himself out of pure scientific curiosity ""I dont know what Im looking for"" he says. Together with a pair of medical mentors (Albert Brooks and Alec Baldwin) he finds trouble The National Football League he decides has been covering up what it knows about the long-term damage caused by the sport. And in slightly overheated dialogue writer-director Peter Landesman underlines how (in Pittsburgh no less) you dont want to go to war with football. ""The NFL owns a day of the week"" explains Brooks as Omalus boss. ""The same day the Church used to own."" A former player Dave Duerson who takes the NFLs side of the story tells Omalu ""Take your bulls - - t science and go back to Africa."" This wont be Duersons last encounter with Omalu though. Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Will Smith star in ""Concussion.""Photo Columbia Pictures With its corny 1980s vibe ""Concussion"" isnt a great movie -- its formulaic and predictable slathered with dopey musical cues and sprinkled with contrived movie-ish dialogue like ""I cant tell whether you are more afraid of what you will find or what you wont."" Moreover the love story between Omalu and another African immigrant (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) is so soft and sexless it feels less like a real romance than the second verse of a Celine Dion song. Yet the film is sober honest and serious about an important subject. What Omalu did took considerable courage In one touching scene he explains that all he ever wanted to do was fit into American life yet blameless scientific inquiry has made him an inadvertent traitor to his adopted culture. ""Concussion"" is a bit vague out of necessity perhaps about what exactly the NFL knew about head injuries and when it knew it. Yet the lack of a single defined enemy -- Luke Wilson plays NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell but his part is essentially a cameo -- makes the film more interesting. Its like Omalu is taking on a mode of thinking. One of Landesmans most understated hence most effective choices is to have Omalu observe without comment a regular weekly ""Monday Night Football"" segment in which announcers would celebrate especially devastating usages of heads as battering rams under the title ""Jacked Up."" Yet the question little kids would ask Omalu he notes with resignation at the end of the film was not ""Why are you concerned about brain damage?"" It was rather ""Why do you hate football?""

As it happens the human brain isnt supposed to whip against the skull like a crash test dummy. Blows to the head can have devastating long-term effects including depression memory loss and a turn toward erratic aggressive behavior. It only takes one big hit to turn todays sports hero into tomorrows case study.By now fans are familiar with the sick ritual of an average Sunday A player gets knocked cold lies prone on the field for a couple of seconds and stumbles off into parts unknown like the wayward penguin in Werner Herzogs Encounters at the End of the World. The announcers will say something glib like ""He got his bell rung"" the team doctor will give him the once-over and soon enough the athlete is back on the field ready for further punishment. Concussion protocol has improved as awareness of CTE has increased -- announcers now speak of bell-ringing in a more sober tone -- but additional safety measures will not likely change the fundamental danger of football. We choose to dip our chips and live with the casualty rate.Film Details Concussion RatingPG-13 GenreDrama Running Time123 min. More Info Trailer The fight over Concussion has already turned into a Goliath-versus-Goliath tussle between Sony (the films distributor) and the NFL which controls its messaging as aggressively as its copyright claims. Back in September an A1 New York Times story drawn largely from a fretful series of leaked emails suggested Sony and the films writer-director Peter Landesman (Parkland) would be the ones to blink first. But like many stories about films filed before their authors have seen them the Times piece turned out to be speculative -- that is unless the NFL is comfortable being depicted as a heartless underhanded obfuscating cabal of corporate goons. (Then again Luke Wilsons square-jawed mirthlessness as commissioner Roger Goodell is no match for the real thing.)Still Concussion often feels softer than a linemans belly. That has less to do with Landesmans willingness to confront the NFL than his inability to keep his eye on the ball. Much like The Insider Michael Manns jaundiced take on the tobacco industry Landesmans film uses a real-life whistleblower to expose the evils of a multibillion-dollar institution. Opening in 2002 Concussion follows Dr. Bennet Omalu (Will Smith) a Nigerian forensic pathologist who conducts autopsies in a Pittsburgh coroners office by treating the dead as if they were living people each with a story to tell. But the fifty-year-old body of Mike Webster (David Morse) a Hall of Fame center for the Steelers aint talking. Websters brain appears normal at autopsy but his medical history prompts Omalu to order additional (and self-financed) testing on Websters tissue matter which reveals disturbing evidence of what Omalu will go on to identify as CTE in a medical journal in 2005.Landesman a former journalist dutifully follows the breadcrumbs from case to case as Omalu accumulates findings from more dead athletes gains a powerful ally in former Steelers team doctor Julian Bailes (Alec Baldwin) and comes under intense scrutiny from the league the media and local sports crazies. Just getting all the facts straight is a lot for one movie to handle to say nothing of offering a thorough look at the metastasizing implications for the culture and business of Americas game. Telling the story through Omalu makes sense as an organizing principle since the current fervor over CTE stems from his findings. And his status as an immigrant and a football agnostic complicates his agenda Hes at once unclouded in his objectives and an outsider easily dismissed by the establishment.Concussion does the baseline work of sounding the alarm on CTE; the NFL wont feel good about the film and will likely tar it with the relentlessness of Scientologys attack on Going Clear. But the more expansive its argument gets the less focused Landesman is on the task at hand. To put it in journalist terms Landesman has turned an expose into a profile piece which works well when the two go hand-in-glove but considerably less so when he drifts into Omalus personal life. A title as blunt as Concussion would seem to function as a narrative North Star but scenes of Omalus courtship of his wife Prema (a squandered Gugu Mbatha-Raw) consistently take the movie off-topic. Is this a film about brain trauma or a Will Smith vehicle? It cant be both.Theres a prevailing sense too that our understanding of the CTE problem is only in its infancy despite the combined force of the NFLs PR spin and a fan base eager to walk it off. Concussion could be the Philadelphia of films about CTE an earnest marker for where the mainstream stood before it grasped the magnitude of the problem. For now though its one for the vault.Concussion Written and directed by Peter Landesman Sony Pictures Opens December 25 Written and directed by Peter Landesman. Based on a GQ article by Jeanne Marie Laskas. Starring Will Smith Alec Baldwin Gugu Mbatha-Raw Arliss Howard Paul Reiser and Luke Wilson.

Movie review Concussion starring Will Smith Article Tweet Columbia Pictures Will Smith in Concussion Concussion   1/2 (out of five) Director Peter Landesman Cast Will Smith Gugu Mbatha-Raw Luke Wilson Rated PG-13 (thematic material including disturbing images strong language) Running time 123 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 132pm on Tuesday Dec. 22 2015 Tuesday Dec. 22 2015 Monday Dec. 21 2015 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Concussion is a football movie thats not about football at least not in the way other sports films are. This biopic of an obscure Pittsburgh doctor who made the first link between head trauma sustained during play and subsequent long-term damage cares little about the big game and more about what happens to the players long after the cheering has stopped.But good intentions dont necessarily lead to good moviemaking. Efficiently made but far less powerful than it might have been Concussion packs all the punch of a greeting card.A very good Will Smith is Nigerian immigrant Dr. Bennet Omalu a forensic neuropathologist who knows nothing about football but starts to sound an alarm after examining the body of local gridiron hero Mike Webster (David Morse). It becomes his crusade perhaps even to the point of putting himself in physical danger as the NFL forcefully pushes back and tries to discredit him.But theres little sense of real danger or drama. Omalu has a love interest a Kenyan immigrant Prema (an underused Gugu Mbatha-Raw) but she has little to do but offer words of encouragement for Omalu.And so it goes as the movie directed by Peter Landesman ( Parkland) never catches fire. While the discussion it has kicked up is worthwhile and Omalu deserves all the credit he can get a Google search on his life and struggles may prove more entertaining.

His voice wrapped around a Nigerian accent and portraying a real-life whistle-blower of religious zeal Smith provides the magnetism needed to bring to life the story of Dr. Bennet Omalu a man whose findings about brain trauma in NFL players have shaken the entire world of sport. Omalu a Pittsburgh neuropathologist who examined the brains of ex-Steelers players who died violent or suspicious deaths makes for an ideal David in the David vs. Goliath oeuvre of investigative-journalist-turned-filmmaker Peter Landesman (Kill the Messenger). The doctor became the target of death threats from fans and of a concerted debunking effort by the billion dollar cartel known as the National Football League. The presentation may be a little heavy-handed. Strings swell as Omalu speechifies on what it means to be an American and on the importance of the truth (although Ive met the man and he really does talk that way). And the ending may seem unduly redemptive considering the NFL - which settled a suit by ex-players - has yet to acknowledge the doctors finding of a condition called CTE caused by a lifetime of sub-concussive hits to the head. But theres no doubt that Omalu is a man whose work now resonates from hockey to soccer. And Smith captures him right down to the eccentric details (including his habit of talking to the dead). Concussion dips lightly into the ugly realities of CTE. The one player we get to know is Mike Webster (a padded and make-up covered David Morse) an all-pro Steelers centre who ended up dying of complications from dementia at age 50. Other characters are portrayed serviceably from Alec Baldwin as the guilt-ridden ex-Steelers team doctor (who watched as his ex-patients and friends disintegrated over the years) to Gugu Mbatha-Raw as the Kenyan-born nurse who became Omalus confidant and then his wife. A movie this crushingly earnest needs a little humour. And it gets just that a little in the wise-cracking mensch performance of Albert Brooks as Dr. Cyril Wecht. Wecht was Omalus boss at the Pittsburgh coroners office who puts his own career on the line to back his proteges unwelcome findings. The love story is lightly but touchingly told. And the plot device of Omalus wife becoming a football fan provides an excuse to pepper the film with shots of plays gracefully executed and offset the notion that Concussion is a football hate-film. Like another release this holiday season the Wall Street tale The Big Short this is a story about a big-money cover-up about the truth and about the ridicule and resistance faced by those who dare speak it out loud. Where Concussion falls short is in the conventionality of the telling. Theres a chronological movie-of-the-week quality to it that might have benefited by a career-directors eye. Still the story itself is powerful enough to give Concussion its punch. Its not a feel-good movie but it is a redemptive and hopeful one. Concussion opens Christmas Day.

Concussions tenacious real-life David (portrayed with fierce commitment by Will Smith) is Dr. Bennet Omalu A gifted Nigerian-born pathologist toiling in a Pittsburgh morgue circa 2002 he finds irregularities in the autopsy of a beloved Steelers star that suggest a medical explanation for the oddly high number of NFL players felled young by drugs depression and suicide. His discovery--a disease he dubs chronic traumatic encephalopathy or CTE--seems to tie directly to the repetitive brain injuries incurred in football which is not welcome news to the multibillion-dollar industry behind it. (""Youre going to war"" his boss warns ""with a corporation that owns a day of the week."") Director Peter Landesman who also helmed last years political thriller Kill the Messenger doesnt color much outside the lines of conventional drama. But his straightforward telling actually serves the strong cast and taut script--and a story that would be deemed too outrageous to believe if it wasnt true.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Concussion takes two things that America has consistently loved--Will Smith and investigative medical procedurals--and pits them against an even bigger cultural touchstone the NFL. Smith plays Dr. Bennet Omalu a Nigerian doctor working in Pittsburgh who examines the body and brain of deceased local hero Mike Webster (David Morse). In investigating how and why a 50-year-old man could die mysteriously after experiencing symptoms of dementia forensic pathologist Omalu uncovers the NFL concussion crisis--the brain damage that can result after football players experience repeated concussions. The organization depressingly but unsurprisingly is not interested in his results beyond what it can do to discredit them.Initially Concussion follows Omalu and Webster in parallel until they meet such as it is during Websters autopsy. Its a procedure many in Pittsburgh would prefer not be conducted at all out of a misguided form of respect. Because he doesnt follow American football (and in fact only owns a television set in deference to American cultural norms) Omalu doesnt recognize Webster and one of the most interesting aspects of the film is the way it operates at least in part from an outsiders view of the games brutality. ""God did not intend for us to play football"" he says at one point and the movie does not regard this view as absurd. To the extent that Concussion can make its material--heavy on shots of people looking at microscopes and lots of talk about the ramifications of Omalus discovery--more cinematic it does so by framing itself as an immigrant story. Omalu holds the United States in the highest esteem and connects with Prema Mutiso (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) another recent transplant who starts as his houseguest and winds up his wife. Smith despite slipping into an African accent and ditching his most recognizable mannerisms still plays a man of superhuman confidence. But he nimbly transforms his usual movie-star cockiness into a soft-spoken calm; outfitted with a ridiculous number of degrees (not just in several fields of medicine but also music and in progress as the movie begins business) Omalu has no doubts about his research. His hesitation takes hold only when the country he idolizes has produced an environment where his findings are treated with hostility or even threats to his family.Smiths Omalu makes a compelling character supported by his mentor Cyril Wecht (Albert Brooks) and former team doctor Julian Bailes (Alec Baldwin). But Concussion doesnt crackle like the best whistleblower dramas. Writer-director Peter Landesman shooting Pittsburgh in grays blues and blown-out whites sometimes smothers the action with excessive close-ups and once the research and discovery portions finish up the movies righteousness (""Tell the truth"" becomes Omalus mantra) can only take the story so far. The movie could have used a dialogue specialist like Aaron Sorkin to punch up the outraged banter--especially with the velvety tones of Baldwin and the wryness of Brooks both on hand begging for better-than-serviceable lines. As is Concussion is thoughtful but workmanlike and not quite up to a full exploration of the issues it raises. In particular it pays lip service to the ""beauty"" of football repeatedly suggested by Prema without bothering to suggest how to reconcile that beauty with its potential to cause regular life-threatening injuries. There may be a story here about the countrys self-destructive love affair with a sport owned and operated by a massive wealthy corporation told through the eyes of an overachieving immigrant. But in the end Concussion sticks to the kinds of points that could be conveyed just as well by a magazine article (its based on one ""Game Brain"" a piece in GQ). Its an advocacy movie that doesnt advocate for anything beyond its already-vindicated hero.

The tale of one doctors crusade to tell the truth about the devastating consequences of chronic head injuries among football players is timely but dreary and dramatically inept. In fact the film is pure Oscar bait complete with a cornball monologue delivered by star Will Smith about what makes America great. Playing David to the NFLs Goliath is Smiths Dr. Bennet Omalu. In lieu of a slingshot the Pittsburgh coroners weapon of choice is a half-dozen post-graduate degrees recited one by one in the opening scene. In the autopsy room Omalu is the kind of quirky detective so familiar on the small screen cajoling cadavers in his lilting Nigerian accent ""Tell me what happened to you"" before cutting into them to figure out how they died. Once he pieces together that his latest corpse a beloved NFL star was ""killed by football"" via mental degeneration from a lifetime of brain injury the good doctor turns grimly ponderous -- and the film does too. Also Read Will Smith Albert Brooks Paul Reiser Tackle Hard-Hitting Concussion Premiere (Photos) Sony The thin plot finds Omalu searching for more evidence of football-induced dementia among players who dont seem to live past 50 while he is persecuted by the NFL. Writer-director Peter Landesman (""Parkland"") doesnt figure out how to stage this effectively; Smith often looks into a microscope slide then squints at the air. More gripping are the harrowing smaller scenes of anguished ex-players who know that there is something wrong with them but dont have the words or the diagnosis to explain the erratic violent behavior they are shocked to find themselves experiencing. Their crises of identity somewhat mirrors the one Omalu undergoes when he considers how the corporate cover-up of his research -- with some assistance from Uncle Sam -- grays his admiration for America a nation hes looked up to all of his life. But Omalus shifting feelings about his adopted homeland dont really resonate since the character while based on a real person is less a flesh-and-blood human than an idealization of an immigrant educated hardworking virtuous patriotic. Despite uneven accent work Smith delivers a fine performance. Also Read Sony NFL Brace for Headaches Over Will Smiths Concussion Pretty much everything else in ""Concussion"" feels requisite from the montages of real-life athletes ramming their skulls together to the football-crazy ally (Alec Baldwin) and the much-younger love interest (Gugu Mbatha-Raw). The rising actress so marvelous as the star of last years ""Belle"" and ""Beyond the Lights"" is saddled with the films most tone-deaf monologue which compares a couple of threatening phone calls from NFL defenders that Omalu receives to (what is heavily implied to be) her rape. Representing a weaselly Roger Goodell is Luke Wilson (in a glorified cameo as the NFL commissioner). The league takes plenty of hits despite earlier reports that Sony had blunted the scripts criticisms of the NFL. ""Concussion"" ultimately avoids any radical conclusion; it simply advocates for players to know all theyre in for when they get on the field. Also Read 17 Movies Shaken by Sony Hack From The Interview to Spectre to Steve Jobs Still for all its acknowledgements of footballs beauty passion and social and economic value the film -- which will debut just six weeks before the next Super Bowl -- makes it unequivocal that going pro might well mean mental illness and an early death for the players. Whether thats a fair trade-off is a conversation worth continuing to have. Too bad ""Concussion"" has so little to add to the discussion. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

"Concussion Review Will Smith vs. the NFL | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review Concussion Andrew Barker Senior Features Writer barkerrant 13 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr Courtesy of Columbia Pictures November 11 2015 | 0433AM PT Peter Landesmans drama pulls no punches in its critique of the NFL but a cliched confused script lets the film down. Perhaps the most important thing to note about Peter Landesmans ""Concussion"" is that despite some pre-release hand-wringing worries that it would represent a whitewash of professional footballs concussion epidemic are completely unfounded. Unfortunately pre-release hopes that it would do for crusading forensic pathologist Dr. Bennet Omalu what Michael Manns ""The Insider"" did for big tobacco whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand are equally unfounded as the films attempt to marry an earnest public-health expose with a corporate-malfeasance thriller and a sweet immigrant love story never comes together in a satisfying way. Effective enough as a cautionary tale about willful ignorance and as a showcase for Will Smith -- delivering a fine understated performance as Omalu the doctor who discovered CTE in former NFL players -- the film is let down by its confused and cliche-riddled screenplay which struggles mightily to take a complex story and finesse it to fit story beats it was never meant to hit. With ""Concussion"" slated for a Christmas release its an open question whether holiday moviegoers will be eager to line up for a film about an autopsy conductor who discovered reasons to feel very bad for enjoying Americas most popular sport but Smiths drawing power should exert a substantial pull. The actor puts his star wattage to clever use here buttoning down but never attempting to hide his natural magnetism as a real-life character whos a force of nature in his own way. A soulful Nigerian immigrant (Smith nails the accent without ever calling undue attention to it) Omalu boasts an almost comically large collection of advanced degrees and certifications. He treats the bodies he dissects in a Pittsburgh coroners office as if they were living patients speaking to them before the autopsy and using brand-new knives to lovingly carve them apart while listening to Teddy Pendergrass. An outsider in the football-mad Pennsylvania city he doesnt think much of the name Mike Webster when the 50-year-olds body turns up in the morgue. As the longtime Super Bowl-winning center for the Steelers Webster (David Morse) was a local hero yet after his retirement he started suffering from memory loss depression and severe mood swings eventually winding up homeless. Omalu is puzzled by how an otherwise healthy athlete could suffer such a dramatic psychological breakdown and decides to run tests on his brain even if it means paying for them out of his own pocket. What he discovers is shocking a degree of neurological deterioration similar to Alzheimers disease. Naming the disorder chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and postulating that the thousands of head-on collisions endured in a pro football career are to blame Omalu publishes his findings in a medical journal that attracts instant pushback from NFL officials. It isnt long before more test cases start piling up and the NFLs deflection efforts grow more intense while Omalu eventually joins forces with Julian Bailes (an irregularly accented but nonetheless effective Alec Baldwin) a former Steelers team doctor who becomes a key co-advocate. Theres more than enough material here for a detail-heavy medical procedural and the repeated willingness shown by so many Americans to shoot the messengers bringing bad news about cherished institutions presents a potent subtext. (At first Omalu naively believes his findings will be welcomed by the NFL who will use them to make the game safer.) Yet ""Concussion"" never quite trusts its audience enough to dive down any interesting rabbit holes and it stumbles when it attempts to flesh out Omalus personal life with scenes that work well enough on their own but stop the pics momentum in its tracks. None of that is the fault of Gugu Mbatha-Raw who brings a great deal of life and verve to her role as the good doctors wife Prema but whenever the film pauses to detail their courtship it tends to lose sight of what its ultimately about. And thats unfortunate considering the story is most affecting when it shines a spotlight on players like Justin Strzelczyk (Matthew Willig) and Dave Duerson (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) who lost their lives while suffering from CTE. Theres something particularly gut-wrenching about seeing the games big men -- the linesmen and tough tacklers who seem so indestructible on the field -- reduced to stumbling around frightened and confused so soon after leaving it. Despite a few glancing lines of dialogue on the beauty of football the NFL deservedly takes it on the chin here and Landesman (""Parkland"") lands his most punishing blows by juxtaposing TV announcers gleefully cooing over big hits with footage of peewee-aged tykes going helmet-to-helmet. The film is less successful however at detailing the consequences Omalu endured for telling his inconvenient truths. Aside from one rude phone call rarely does Landesman actually show us what being a social pariah must have been like for Omalu and some of the details he includes are puzzling. One scene shows Prema believing shes being followed around town by a car and cuts immediately to her suffering a miscarriage. Another sequence has FBI agents raid the office of Omalus boss Cyril Wecht (Albert Brooks) lobbing vague threats at Omalu while theyre at it. If Landesman means to imply that the NFL is somehow behind the raid he doesnt even begin to make his case; and if he doesnt then its unclear what the scene is even doing here. (Likewise casting Luke Wilson for a few blink-and-you-miss-him scenes as league commissioner Roger Goodell proves far more distracting than its worth.) The film is sharply edited by William Goldenberg and well shot by d.p. Salvatore Totino although James Newton Howards score starts with the dial tuned up to 11 and somehow keeps getting louder.

A disgrace that this movie was not more successful. Its not about football. Its about whats gone terribly wrong with America. Its about capitalism run amok. Its about so called ""job creators"". And its about the disgraceful denial of the truth in favor of commerce. At least that what I see in it and it makes me want to cry and rage. And its about an American hero who was not even an American but everything that makes America great. In spite of itself. Reply Concussion says December 29 2015 at 1247 pm This film is fantastic. i love it. Reply Antoine Saad says December 27 2015 at 246 pm Why is there negativity on this review? Are you getting money from the NFL? The film is about bringing light to a real issue. Life threatening brain trauma. With real scientific research to prove the claims. Do you care about the real people who have suffered from CTE? And people suffer from it today not knowing it. This is bigger then the Dr who discovered CTE and bigger then the NFL. The film was portrayed as good as it could explaining the science behind CTE and didnt get to caught up in the life of the Dr who discovered it. Brain trauma is the issue. Along with the lack of acknowledgement with this serious life threatening issue so people can make money off a game. Have a heart. Open your mind. This is bigger then just another movie. More research more funding to address CTE. Reply Sickoftheleft says December 27 2015 at 312 am This is really ""Will Smith vs American Society"" .. Funny how apparently concussion only happen in football but not in SoccerBoxingMMAHockey Wrestling The Military...This movie has more to do with attacking a male dominated pro-American sport than about highlighting head injuries. If the people who made ""Concussion"" really cared then theyd highlight the epidemic of concussions in girls soccer and cheer-leading or the other sports I mentioned or how its a problem in the military(along with the missing limbs etc) Reply Hollywood Mark says December 24 2015 at 210 am How is Landesman still working. One flop after another. Run out of New York for shoddy journalism at the NY Times and immediately he is directing Parkland for Playtone. Movie bombs. Cost 10 mill - grossed 622 grand. Kill The Messenger he wrote/produced and that lost money. Cost 5 mill - grossed 2 mil. Now they give him Concussion? Budget 35 million WTF does this guy have going on? Reply mizz4four2 says December 19 2015 at 113 pm I am born and bred Nigerian living in Nigeria and we sound nothing like Smith did in the movie. He didnt nail any accent Variety. Im not impressed. Reply Crystal Payne says November 21 2015 at 637 pm On my soapbox I have seen the preview for Concussion now twice and I am boycotting it There is a part that refers to football players as warriors and this appalls me Warriors are our servicemen and woman who fight to defend our country and help maintain our rights as well to help others. They do this out of loyalty to our country and for the love of family and friends not for fame and money Their lives are in jeopardy they make very little money are separated from family and friends and dont live in the best of conditions. Some are lost to their families forever while some come back with missing limbs or PTS. Yet they still sign-up knowing the possibilities. They dont have people asking them for their autographs or t-shirts with their names on them. No one asks them to do commercials for money because of their service. Once a year we celebrate these people on Veterans Day but would you know who they are if they werent in uniform? Reply Grrg says December 2 2015 at 211 am I understand what youre trying to get at. But that has been going on for years. My grandfather fought in world war two for this country then had to come back to a segregated America that told him he wasnt good enough use certain restrooms or eat at certain restaurants. Both of my uncles never recovered from nam. My older brother went to Iraq earned himself a career when he got out and still gets harassment from local police for no reason at all. Its silly. As sad as all of that it is its just a part of of life. Those veterans deal with it. Maybe you should learn how to to. Reply Emmanuel says November 17 2015 at 932 am Will Smith Does NOT nail the Accent and I really wish people would stop saying. Its bad. really really bad. It doesnt sound like any of the numerous accents anywhere in English speaking west Africa. Not any Ghanaian accent  not liberian and certainly not Nigerian. because hollywood is too lazy to tell the difference ( and the differences are great) dont think 180 million Nigerians cant. Reply Kith says November 11 2015 at 224 pm This has GREAT potential. I hope it as good as it seems. Reply 85wzen says November 11 2015 at 144 pm The film is less successful however at detailing the consequences Omalu endured for telling his inconvenient truths. -------------- Here it is.... this is where they probably took out quite a lot over at Sony. Not like the reviewer here will know what Sony decided to take out. Has Mr. Omalu written a book yet? Hopefully that is next. Still thematically the Script sounds troubled like so many Hollywood Productions no one knows what an editor is because no one there knows what a SCREENWRITER does anymore... But thats what happens when you fire all your Elders and hire a bunch of Agents to run the show... Remember that? Reply Kim says November 11 2015 at 104 pm I think you are over-estimating Smiths drawing power especially in an off-brand movie. Focus didnt do too well and After Earth was a flop. Before that Seven Pounds his attempt at drama also flopped. So starring in a movie in which he both sports an accent suppresses his natural charisma AND takes on our national pastime does not bode well for box-office. Reply Mitch says November 11 2015 at 225 pm Very strong points Kim. But there are a LOT of football fans that will see this film and it has a chance. Love all your points thought well-though out.

TWITTER Will Smith stars as the Nigerian-born doctor who helped identify the brain damage afflicting many pro football players. Movies ""torn from the headlines"" were once a Hollywood staple going back to the gangster films of the 1930s. But in recent years as projects take longer and longer to come to fruition and as studios grow more cautious its rare to find a truly timely topical drama. Concussion is one of the exceptions. It dramatizes a crisis that is still making headlines today the dangers of serious brain damage caused by the violent collisions of pro football. The NFL fought to bury the evidence of these medical perils and the league cant be happy about a high-profile movie bringing the issues into the limelight. Credit should go to producer Ridley Scott and to the executives who backed the movie keeping alive a tradition of muckraking that once did Hollywood proud. Although the film is imperfect it has unmistakable urgency and Will Smiths star power should ensure healthy box office returns. Smith plays Dr. Bennet Omalu a Nigerian-born pathologist working in Pittsburgh who investigates the untimely death of former Steelers star Mike Webster. Omalu suspects a connection between all the blows to the head that Webster suffered and the dementia that led to his death. As he looks into the deaths of other players Omalu identifies a brain trauma called CTE that is disturbingly widespread. NFL doctors and club owners try to bury his findings but eventually Omalu finds allies who help him to publicize the truth. This summary may make the film sound like an academic paper but its thoroughly engrossing and entertaining. Director Peter Landesman worked as a journalist before moving into filmmaking and he has a sense of how to grab an audience. He also showed in his underrated film Parkland a drama about the Kennedy assassination that he has a real gift in drawing strong performances from a large cast. Under Landesmans guidance Smith transforms himself impressively. He handles the accent without any fuss and he submerges his usual wise-guy persona into the character of this slightly stiff and arrogant doctor. Smith doesnt idealize Omalu; we can see why the dogged self-assured man can anger his colleagues. The fact that Omalu knew nothing about football probably made him the ideal person to puncture one of Americas sacred cows.

Prema never seems cowed by her brilliant husband; shes willing to stand up to him and challenge him. Alec Baldwin has a large role as the former Steelers doctor who becomes Omalus ally and although Baldwins Southern accent wobbles he plays his sympathetic role forcefully. Albert Brooks as Omalus cynical mentor comes close to stealing the movie. But whats most impressive about Landesmans work is that he also allows actors who only have a scene or two to register vividly. David Morse is unrecognizable in his few scenes as Webster but he works from the inside out and in just a few moments makes us understand the ravages that the game has wrought on this once mighty warrior. Eddie Marsan Arliss Howard and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje also make the most of just a few moments of screen time to create characters who come fully alive. Although Smith is the star of the film this is a true ensemble movie in which every performer enriches the tapestry. As a piece of filmmaking Concussion is competent but not inspired. The brief flashes of violence on the football field make their point in a rather pro forma way; they dont quite achieve the necessary impact. James Newton Howards score is sometimes effective and sometimes bombastic. On the other hand Oscar winning editor William Goldenberg (Argo) helps keep the film hurtling forward. In the end this film is vital in uncovering a hazard that was kept hidden for far too long. At last the secret is out and Landesman and his fine cast will help to keep the conversation going.
