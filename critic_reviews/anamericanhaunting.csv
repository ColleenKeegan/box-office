"American Haunting Boo Hiss washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies American Haunting Boo Hiss Boo Sissy Spacek with Rachel Hurd-Wood cant save the day from poltergeists in the cliched ""American Haunting."" (After Dark Films) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Saturday May 6 2006 ""An American Haunting"" a movie about poltergeists and people screaming in 19th-century costumes wants to exude the scary B-movie ethos of films like ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"" going for those herky-jerky camera movements as if the filmmakers were too terrified to keep a steady grip. It also wants you to think about and shiver over the supposedly real events on which its based In Tennessee during the 1800s an evil spirit is said to have traumatized a certain John Bell and his family and Bells death was attributed to the spirits relentless harassment. (Andrew Jackson is rumored to have visited their farm for sightings of this ""Bell Witch."") You may recall that the 1999 fictional ""Blair Witch Project"" ""documented"" the disappearance of three student filmmakers in the Burkittsville woods of Maryland. The film purported to be found footage made by the doomed students in their final days. And those wobbly camera movements along with the actors clumsy hesitant performances further suggested an authenticity. But ""American Haunting"" co-writer and director Courtney Solomon (his sole credit before this producing and directing ""Dungeons amp; Dragons"") tries -- and fails -- to evoke that whoa-did-this-really-happen edge. That shaky camera just feels contrived. And those subjective swoops -- like were watching from the demons own point of view sort of a Marauding Spirit Cam -- are repeated so often they become unintentionally comic. Youre not sure whether the characters are running away from a ghost or some deranged cameraman who keeps bursting into peoples homes and yelling ""Im a ghost with a camera Whoooo"" Its unfortunate that the freakiest factor about the film is its source material -- a subject that has inspired more than a dozen books. It certainly isnt Donald Sutherland whose rendition of Bell in post-bellum attire and a bleached virtual-fright wig is significantly less than scary. Oh lets just say it Hes funny. The Canadian actor who has chewed scenery through other horror flicks (remember ""The Puppet Masters""? Otherworldly slugs land on Earth and control our minds?) pulls out all the thespian stops with a Tennessee drawl and perpetually widened eyes. His over-the-top theatrics undercut Solomons efforts to create that bona-fide creepy experience. Bells wife Lucy is played by Sissy Spacek no stranger to horror of course thanks to her superb role as the tortured schoolgirl in ""Carrie."" Although shes a more believable presence than Sutherland shes reduced to well-meaning wifely support running to comfort whomever is screaming or yelling at the time. Most of the time thats her daughter Betsy (Rachel Hurd-Wood) another recipient of this dark spirits assault and battery. And though he may be going for that B-movie style Solomon also reaches for the groan-inducing cliches of mainstream movies. Did he have to use ""Psycho""-like screechy violin effects for that one climactic scene? And is he unaware that disembodied kiddie voices have cluttered seemingly every Hollywood horror film of the past 20 years? It doesnt help either that Hurd-Wood appears to channel Linda Blair from ""The Exorcist"" as she screams flails and writhes on her bed. (At one point shes practically Winnie-the-Pooh as the spirit drags her up the stairs like a malevolent Christopher Robin.) This confusion of tropes and general hokum makes us root for the wrong resolution for the spirit to take care of business -- in other words for evil to deliver us from our own. An American Haunting (83 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for terror sequences and adult themes.

Set in rural Tennessee in 1817 this allegedly true tale of demonic possession is weighed down by period detail and ponderous storytelling which soon get the better of its Exorcist-inspired levitations flying crucifixes and noisy poltergeist activity. As usual a girl on the cusp of womanhood is the focus of spiritual familial and sexual disturbance. Betsy (Rachel Hurd-Wood) suffers nightmares in which she is hoisted into the air and slapped about the face by an unseen entity. Her parents (Sutherland and Spacek) call in the local priest and even the obligatory sceptic local teacher Richard Powell (James DArcy) is forced to acknowledge the presence of evil. Adrian Biddles moody cinematography lends a classy gloss to a film that is both encumbered and embarrassed by its generic trappings the would-be Sixth Sense-style ending makes no more sense than the redundant contemporary wraparound story.

"For all the wrong reasons American Haunting is a horror - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW For all the wrong reasons American Haunting is a horror By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  May 5 2006 Theres a dark abiding mystery at the center of An American Haunting"" and its how on earth major stars such as Donald Sutherland and Sissy Spacek were talked into appearing in this film. A cringingly awful period ghost story Haunting"" is amateur hour all around The script is DOA the performances struggle to reach the level of community theater and Caine Davidsons incessant score wouldnt pass muster on a daytime soap.The thing barely qualifies as a movie. Trust me youll find more compelling drama in the historical reenactments at Old Sturbridge Village.As written and directed by Courtney Solomon (his only other credit is 2000s Dungeons and Dragons"" but that starred Jeremy Irons -- who does this guy know?) An American Haunting"" purports to tell the true story of the Bell Witch a poltergeist who tormented the Bell family of Adams Station Tenn. in the early 1800s. The opening titles describe the case as the most documented haunting in American history"" but neglect to mention that almost all the documentation"" was the work of a local newspaperman whose book on the subject was published 70 years after the fact.Aside from a few incomprehensible modern-day scenes that bracket the story Haunting"" takes place back on the Tennessee frontier where local farmer John Bell (Sutherland) gets into a land dispute with neighbor Kate Batts (Gaye Brown) whos rumored to be a witch.Indeed strange things begin to happen in the bedroom of oldest daughter Betsy (Rachel Hurd-Wood Wendy in the most recent Peter Pan"") Bedcovers fly off and the girl is held by an unseen force in midair while being repeatedly slapped. John and his wife Lucy (Spacek) are horrified and even a skeptic like handsome young schoolteacher Mr. Powell (James DArcy) comes around when the crucifixes start flying off the walls.Unfortunately Haunting"" doesnt have a plot per se so much as one lame spectral assault after another followed by a twist ending that only confuses the issue. Solomon films it all through a misty veil that suggests a feminine hygiene ad and the camera rockets around so insistently that physical nausea is added to aesthetic pain. If the director is saying anything here its Weve got a Steadicam and were not afraid to use it.""The actors deliver their lines and look for the available exits. Sutherland still has his Pride and Prejudice"" hair on and is as professional as he can be under the circumstances but Hurd-Wood and Spacek appear to have been stunned either by a heavy object or the script or both. Haunting"" gets points as easily the worst film Spacek has appeared in; Hurd-Wood is still young of course and Sutherland -- well hed show up for a wedding video if the food was good.At certain points you may wonder if An American Haunting"" is meant as parody. A couple of shots of Betsy passed out on her schoolroom desk like a drunken frat girl almost seem calculated to get a laugh. But then the camera staggers off once more and the music kicks into aural overdrive and you realize these people are serious -- astoundingly inept yes but serious.Perhaps a few credulous moviegoers will buy it but the rest will write it off as one more regional ghost story gone flat-line on the big screen. Even so An American Haunting"" sets the bar at a new low It makes The Blair Witch Project"" look like a masterpiece of world cinema.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 4 2006 424 PM Little Ghost on the Prairie An American Haunting is definitely not based on a true story. By Grady Hendrix Sissy Spacek In the spirit of The Exorcism of Emily Rose here comes another PG-13 horror flick about a girl getting possessed by demons. Sporting Donald Sutherland and Sissy Spacek in the cast and supposedly based on ""true events validated by the State of Tennessee as the only case in US history where a spirit has caused the death of a human being"" this is a well-packaged film that arrives like a nicely wrapped Christmas present full of promise and potential. Then you unwrap it and discover that its just another electric gravy boat and worse its still got the price tag attached. Written and directed by Courtney Solomon whose only other credit is the supernaturally bad Dungeons amp; Dragons An American Haunting is set in 1818 in Red River Tenn. John Bell (Donald Sutherland) is a local bigwig whose shady land deal with a neighbor earns him a curse. In short order his house is filled with bumpings rumblings and an invisible entity that simulates sex with his daughter Betsy before hauling her out of bed by her hair and tossing her around the room. The family takes this hard and things get harder when the slap-happy ghost starts punching and throwing them around the room too. They acquire a persecuted haunted look as the entity steps up its aggression unleashing hordes of wolves and orchestrating kinetic carriage accidents as well as a bevy of dime-store digital effects whose cheesiness repeatedly undercuts the tension. At the end of the film were told that the source of the haunting is a dark family secret about sexual abuse rather than a demon from hell and while this revelation could have elevated this flick out of the low-budget ghetto it merely buries it further and not just because of the title card with grammar mistakes that pops up right after the big reveal. Advertisement This movie is like that fellow in the logic puzzle who can only tell lies--if you see something onscreen then you can be certain its not true from the number of kids the Bells have (four in the movie nine in real life) to whatever is going on in the background (kids playing soccer--soccer balls appeared in the United States after 1850). The movie portrays 19th-century American life anachronistically as if the Bells were just some funky retro-dressing folks who lived in the O.C. and not members of a gruelingly isolated community whose inhabitants were regarded as little better than pagans caught up in the first waves of the Second Great Awakening. Religion is casually mentioned in An American Haunting but mostly in a ""By the power of Jesus Christ I compel you to leave this house"" kind of way. Its never acknowledged that the Bell family were also attending regular revival meetings at their local church where congregants would be possessed by the Holy Spirit and find themselves compelled to fall on all fours bark dance wildly and experience seizures. Its also not a true story. If lying is the latest trend in American pop culture (cf James Frey Kaavya Viswanathan) then An American Haunting is on the cutting edge. Its closely based on The Bell Witch An American Haunting by Brent Monahan a 1995 novel that claims to be the true story of the Bell Witch based on newly discovered papers belonging to Richard Powell Betsy Bells husband. These papers dont exist. Monahans book is an expert fabrication and a good read but its fiction as Monahan himself will tell you. Most of the books about the Bell Witch are sourced from an 1894 volume called An Authenticated History of the Bell Witch of Tennessee by Martin Van Buren Ingram. This volume was written 60 years after the fact and is regarded by some historians as a novel that used real people and places to give it the appearance of reality. Ingram was a newspaperman who was on the hustle for a story all of his life. Repeated business setbacks family problems and poor health may have made him hungry for a hit. In 1896 the act of cashing in was not anachronistic. The movie claims that there have been ""over 20 books"" written about the Bell Witch but in reality there are fewer than 15 the legend is little-known outside Tennessee and it wasnt mentioned at all until a jolly paragraph appeared in 1886s The Goodspeed History of Tennessee in which the spirit comes across as a happy sort who ""... would hold conversation and even shake hands. ..."" The Bell Witch of the legends was a chatty Cathy and people came from miles around to listen to her sing and tell jokes. She would reveal minor embarrassing secrets about locals much to everyones amusement and people still speak in hushed tones about her encounter with Andrew Jackson. The fact that this encounter is never mentioned in any of Jacksons journals letters or other papers nor in the papers of anyone who was with him at the time hasnt detracted from it one bit. As for the movies claim that the story is ""... validated by the State of Tennessee as the only case in US history where a spirit has caused the death of a human being"" I assume theyre talking about the record of John Bells death and that is inarguable. Yes John Bell did die. So did pretty much everyone else who was born in 1750. He was also a human male. Beyond that the State of Tennessee is silent. There have been two other Bell Witch movies The Bell Witch Haunting (2004) and Bell Witch The Movie (2005). Both were low-budget productions and both had the decency to come and go without elaborate claims to authenticity. But like the Bell Witch herself An American Haunting insists on being noticed grabbing audiences by the hair and throwing them about the room. And theres only one way to deal with its evil ""By the power of Jesus Christ I compel you to leave this multiplex at once"" Grady Hendrix is one of the founders of the New York Asian Film Festival and he writes about pop culture on his blog.

The hard-core ""jump-scare"" crowd may well succumb to ""An American Haunting"" but auds who prefer their screamfests to be something more than nerve-wracking will avoid this Federalist-era ""Exorcist"" like a case of demonic possession. Look for some theatrical thanks to the weight of the cast but a limited lifespan due to an uncertainty about its audience The fright quotient is strictly for the slumber-party crowd but the plot payoff is about sexual abuse and incest. Sissy Spacek are John and Lucy Bell land-owning 1817 Tennesseans and parents of the nubile Betsy Bell (Rachel Hurd-Wood) and the stalwart John Jr. (Thom Fell). When John Sr. is found guilty of loan-sharking by his fellow churchmen the victim of his greed apparently puts a curse on the family; shortly thereafter young Betsy starts having nightmares of the Elm Street variety. Based on Brent Monahans novel ""The Bell Witch An American Haunting"" -- which was itself based on what is apparently the only known case in which the U.S. government acknowledged a death by supernatural forces -- ""American Haunting"" is a difficult film to get a grip on. The opening seems almost satiric -- a young girl runs through the woods pursued by something she cant escape and we cant see the p.o.v. shifting from stalker to prey. Then the girl wakes up She is a descendant of the Bells and a letter left for her mother flashes back the action nearly 200 years. Writer-director Courtney Solomon seems to have been undecided whether or not to make a comedy The acting is so arch the mannerisms so deliberate that they send up not only satanic-possession thrillers but post-Revolutionary America in general. Sutherland is an anachronismadopting neither the inflections nor formal manner of his co-stars. But then John Bell is a man alone whose sins will be the undoing of his family. Solomon is particularly enamored of rapidly burning candles to signify fleeting time; scratch marks left by fingernails dragged demonically across painted pinewood floors. Betsy gets thrown around like a ragdoll during her many screaming nightmares. There are moments of comedy relief. One night when the attic sounds like its full of elephants Lucy Bell deadpan asks her husband ""Squirrels?"" James DArcy plays the local teacher and all-around authority Richard Powell with conviction but Richards skepticism about Betsys possession becomes a bit hard to swallow especially after half the town has seen her dangling from the rafters with her face getting slapped as if by the disembodied spirit of Moe Howard. A well-made good-looking movie it is but between the non-stop tumult and the sense of deliberateness about its period authenticity ""An American Haunting"" produces a lot of screaming crying and cruelty but not much drama.
