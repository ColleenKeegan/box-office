Find out whats happening in the world as it unfolds.Jessica Chastain plays CIA analyst Maya a woman in a predominantly masculine world in Kathryn Bigelows ""Zero Dark Thirty.""Story highlightsThe film follows how a CIA analyst worked for a decade tracking down Osama bin LadenDirector Kathryn Bigelow has been accused of endorsing tortureJessica Chastain delivers one of the must-see performances of the year our critic saysIn a place that does not exist -- a black site -- Maya (Jessica Chastain) watches as her colleague Dan (Jason Clarke) interrogates an Arab prisoner. ""If you lie to me I hurt you"" Dan says to the prisoner who is bound bruised and not telling the Americans what they need to know. Soon the prisoner will be held down on the floor with a cloth over his face and will have water poured into his mouth until he is half-drowned. This is waterboarding and it leaves the prisoner gasping like a dying fish. But he does not give up his secrets and will not until later in the game. We can imagine this scene played out in different ways. Imagine it for example with Eastern European heavies playing the interrogators and Scarlett Johansson as the prisoner. Or we could see it with Kiefer Sutherland demanding answers in ""24."" Scenes of torture are not rare in TV and movies and its not like the old days when the hero was always on the receiving end. Yet even before ""Zero Dark Thirty"" opened these scenes have stirred controversy with outspoken critiques accusing director Kathryn Bigelow (""The Hurt Locker"") of endorsing torture. And although controversy is nothing new to the director of ""Strange Days"" and ""Near Dark"" these complaints seem off base. Bigelow has never shied away from violence or the vicarious pleasure of sadism but thats not the same thing as condoning it. Look at how she filters the torture scenes through Mayas reactions Maya is clearly out of place and uncomfortable with what she must witness though she will also participate in it.

That work involved torture in the years immediately following 9/11 as a matter of historical record.Bigelow throws us in at the deep end and rightly so. The scenes are painful to watch (but also impossible not to) and the intelligence gleaned is at best partial. Whether partial intelligence is better than none is an open question but its also evident in ""Zero Dark Thirty"" that it wasnt torture that eventually led us to bin Laden but clear thinking sophisticated surveillance and the determination and resources to follow every lead. Bigelow has rarely focused on women as active protagonists (""Blue Steel"" is the most notable exception) but it is significant that Maya is a woman in a predominantly masculine world compelled to renounce her sexuality to get the job done. Mayas resolve smarts and conviction that borders on obsessive make her a fascinating and impressive character and Chastain delivers one of the must-see performances of the year. Bergen A feminist film epic and the real women of the CIABigelow keeps the focus on process -- in a way its like a police procedural or a detective story but played out in foreign lands and interspersed with eruptions of violence and bomb blasts. The climax -- the SEALs raid -- is nail-biting stuff even though we know the outcome with exceptionally vivid nighttime photography by Greig Fraser.Whats striking is the absence of triumphalism -- Bigelow doesnt shy away from showing the victims shot down in cold blood in the compound -- and we come away with the overwhelming sense that this has been a grim dark episode in our history a rite of passage almost but a passage into an unknowable future leaving scars that may never heal.

Their 2009 Oscar-winner The Hurt Locker followed a bomb disposal unit in Iraq. Now theyve made this sidekick - a gritty unbelievably tense procedural about the decade-long hunt for Osama Bin Laden. These are action films for people who think action movies are dumb they put us thrillingly on the inside of history (at least it feels that way) and grip in their journalistic detail. Zero Dark Thirty makes Homeland look as dangerous as Downton Abbey. It begins heartbreakingly on 9/11. The screen is black and we hear the voice of a woman inside one of the towers - on the phone to the emergency services. She knows shes going to die. The operator is trained to deal with worst-case scenarios but what can she say? Two planes have flown into New Yorks iconic skyscrapers. All the rules have been broken. Then... bang. The action shifts to Pakistan where a fresh-faced CIA agent Maya (Jessica Chastain) is having a lesson in interrogation. She watches a colleague negotiate with an al-Qaida operative give me an email address and Ill give you food. Next torture dog collars waterboarding sleep deprivation and one line repeated over and over When you lie to me I hurt you. Maya is horrified. You assume shes going to be the voice of Americas conscience (after all Chastain is the actress who played the dreamy earth-mother in The Tree of Life). But no six months later she is using the same lines making the same trades. Theres chemistry between Maya and her CIA boss but this isnt a movie where the girl gets the guy; this is the movie where she gets the Big Guy - a nickname for Bin Laden. Zero Dark Thirty is lean mean storytelling no backstories no-frills - just action and an effortless forward momentum. Maya is obsessed with tracking down one of her leads a man said to be Bin Ladens courier. Some might think Bigelow is apologising for torture with this film. Shes not. Shes interested in why Maya and her CIA colleagues behave as they do - with the detachment of a reporter. We see the desperate context they work in - the tick tick tick wait for more bombs to go off around the world. Years pass. We watch a pile-up of dead-ends and mistakes. Boal spent the best part of a decade talking to counterterrorism operatives and it shows in his faultless dialogue. At CIA headquarters they question Mayas credibility. What do you think of her? asks the CIA director (James Gandolfini). Shes smart answers an advisor. Were all smart he deadpans. Its 2010 and some analysts doubt Bin Laden is still the game or perhaps hes dead. Bigelow is the smartest guy in the room when it comes to portraying tribes from the CIA wonks to the big suicidally brave knucklehead Navy Seals sent in to take out Bin Laden all barrel chests on the outside mushy-sweet on the inside. The endgame - a raid on a suburban house in Pakistan - is a white-knuckle watch. And when a Seal finally puts a bullet into a thin grey-bearded man you dont doubt for a second this is what it was like dogs barking freaked-out locals raising a mob outside. This is an instant classic.

Certainly a film of two halves first of interrogations leading to an probable inconclusive ending then suddenly shifting a gear when a courier gets identified. The second half really gripped me Bourne style and by the end i wanted to vote for Obama too. There are some things to criticise but these are minor really considering the silliness that exists in other films with singing or tigers. I really wasnt expecting Tony Soprano to turn up in a suit inside the CIA so really had to suspect disbelief at that point.

In real life tourture is atrocious and most inhuman. That said Zero Dark Thirty is a well made gripping movie albeit a predictable one. Jessica Chastain acting is good but seems a bit fictitious or maybe shes just a fanatic American. Recommendable but not a must see film in my opinion.

If you have no interest in current affairs you WILL find all but the final ASTONISHING last 40 or so minutes could go Im the former so while this is very fine I cant honestly say its excellent...and the silly daily red pen writing on glass sequence - followed by Chastain snorting and snarling like a 4 year old brat - was just awfully misjudged. 7+/10Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 30 2013Justin BerkoviFeaturedI love Bigelow and was really looking forward to this. However Zero Dark Thirty is flawed and I left feeling frustrated with various elements. The main problem is Chastain. Whilst one of my favourite actresses at the moment she was completely unconvincing as Maya. She seemed to struggle with the role and moments of aggression in her dialogue scenes came across as extremely forced and decidedly amateurish for an actress of her calibre. This then was undermined what was for the most part a good film. There were other moments where Bigelows usual mastery faltered. Some scenes were too drawn out the editing sloppy and the tension (Something I usually see as a Bigelow forte) weak. These flaws made certain aspects of the film seem dumbed down. However what redeems the film in terms of enjoyment is the final twenty minutes or so. Superb tension and dramatisation of the actual raid on Bin Laden. Whereas Hurt Locker was a tight tense film unfortunately Zero Dark Thirty is a bit sloppy and weaker for it.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 28 2013chris jacksonFeaturedit took a while to get going and showed the american government and CIA in appalling light  wow did i dislike MAya by the end.. that having been said it is very well made and doesnt set out to show america s the good guys.

Chastain is excellent and fully deserves to be favourite for best actress on this performance. In my mind it is much better than Lincoln and of the nominees I have seen thus far is the most deserving to win the Best Film oscar. It is a bit long and in places does veer a little too close to cliche to be a great film.

The torture scenes are not so graphic as to make them unwatchable. Once these scenes are out of the way the film becomes a chase movie without any characterisation - mainly because American politicians are very boring to the point of being robots. The mid-section where they zero-in on the ""messenger"" is gripping using handheld sat-nav trackers. This part resembles the Bourne movies The last section is the actual raid seemingly filmed in graphite. It is in this section that Bigelow excels in her cold-eyed version of what happened. This is blistering film making which places the viewer straight into the action. The executions are cold and without any patriotic chest-thumping. The score accompanying this is perfect. This is a five star film despite the questionable casting of Gandalfini and John Barrowman (tiny part).

One could really feel that one was in Pakistan (while the movie was mostly shot in Jordan) for example. Jessica Chastian gave a truly amazing Oscar-deserving performance as the CIA-agent who finally solved the mystery of where Osama Bin Laden actually was. I found the various torture scenes a little bit too gruesome to watch though at times but that was apparently what actually happened when George W. Bush Jr. was still the president of the United States even if the CIA apparently tried to deny it recently. This movie would be a big succes in the U.K. and on the European continent I think as this is a movie which is based on one of the most important periods of our modern history starting from September 11 2001.

"Zero Dark Thirty a masterful thriller review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesZero Dark Thirty a masterful thriller reviewKathryn Bigelows Zero Dark Thirty turns a spy-trade procedural into the most white-knuckle of thrillers.Jessica Chastain plays Maya the unlikely hero whose persistence led to the discovery and killing of Osama bin Laden.  (Jonathan Olley / Columbia Pictures)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Jan. 11 2013 Zero Dark Thirty (out of 4)Starring Jessica Chastain Jason Clarke Jennifer Ehle Mark Strong Kyle Chandler and Reda Kateb. Directed by Kathryn Bigelow. 157 minutes. Opens Jan. 11 at major theatres. 14ATake a good look at the scene in Zero Dark Thirty where Jessica Chastains Maya stands watching the all-male Navy SEALS fly off to take down Osama bin Laden. Its just about the only moment in this incredible film that could be called conventional the anxious woman left behind as the men go off to be heroes with Alexandre Desplats magnificently tense score rising along with the dust of their stealth Black Hawk helicopters.Article Continued BelowWe already know that Maya is no mere stereotype in this movie by Kathryn Bigelow -- nominated Thursday for five Academy Awards -- that combines dramatic flair with documentary realism and that turns a spy-trade procedural into the most white-knuckle of thrillers.Maya is the real hero of Zero Dark Thirty the CIA targeter (likely a composite of several) whose diligence and persistence led to the discovery and 2011 killing of 9/11 terror mastermind bin Laden the worlds most wanted man. But its one of the many distinctions of this film that afterwards you question what ""hero"" really means.Chastain makes Maya as vivid as a bloodshot eye. Her porcelain skin delicate features and feminine attire belie the steel within. Shes had to fight sexism doubt and red tape throughout her career but she has proven herself in situations that would make many men flinch.This includes the torture scene at the films outset following a mercifully brief prologue over a darkened screen where the voices of doomed World Trade Center victims are heard in cellphone calls on Sept. 11 2001. Its set in a filthy room in a CIA ""black site."" Maya impassively watches her face hidden by a ski mask as Dan (Jason Clarke) the spy agencys ""man in Islamabad"" brutally attempts to pry information about bin Laden and his al-Qaeda operation from captured terror suspect Ammar (Reda Kateb).Beatings humiliation waterboarding and finally confinement are used against Ammar who refuses to give up his secrets. The frustration is palpable on the faces of Dan and Maya and similar situations early in the film confirm the futility of what the CIA euphemistically calls ""enhanced interrogation.""This is no small point. Anyone who callsZero Dark Thirty pro-torture is not only wrong but clearly not paying attention. The secrets that lead to the successful location of bin Laden come not from brute force but from guile solid detective work and a couple of lucky breaks. The film makes all of this clear but it also doesnt spoon-feed the viewer. Intelligent engagement is required.Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal lay it all out as carefully as they did the bomb-disposal techniques in The Hurt Locker their previous collaboration that won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2010 and also Best Director for Bigelow and Best Original Screenplay for Boal.Maya is wisely the focus of a serpentine narrative that uncoils between the Middle East Washington D.C. and Langley Virginia.The red-haired fury has to push through obstacles posed by a dismissive U.S. Embassy station chief in Pakistan (Kyle Chandler) by a hard-to-convince boss at the CIAs Virginia HQ (Mark Strong) and by the once-burned twice-shy National Security Advisor (Stephen Dillane).Fortunately Maya finds allies in the CIA director (James Gandolfini) who is impressed by her intelligence intensity and brutally frank talk and later also with the sardonic Navy SEALS who are tasked with bringing the fire directly to bin Laden.As Zero Dark Thirty shifts into thriller mode for its final act with cinematographer Greig Fraser switching between standard and night-vision views it seems like the culmination of a carefully laid plan rather than an abrupt shift in tone.Thats because it is. As she has throughout Bigelow dispenses with conventional suspense-building tricks (this film is so unlike the lesser Argo in that regard) and instead shows a highly credible version of what very likely happened on that fateful May evening in bin Ladens fortress compound in Abbottabad Pakistan.Theres no emphasis on any single Navy SEAL or even on bin Laden who is referred to simply as ""the third-floor guy"" in the movie moment normally reserved for high-five antics. There are bullets blood and violence but youll see more of all of that in Gangster Squad one of the other movies opening this week.Just as with the torture that began the movie Bigelow and Boal seek not to express an opinion to push a political line or to exaggerate already momentous events. They simply want to serve history by showing reality or what passes for it in the shadowy and contradictory worlds of spy ""tradecraft"" and covert manoeuvres (the films title is a military time reference).They grandly succeed and they also invest Maya with an authenticity not often accorded to dramatic figures. Our final view of her is a silent one but the truth of what shes seen and done is all in her eyes.Read more about Osama Bin LadenThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

In this version of the story Zero Dark Thirty is a gripping study about people operating on the psychological edge a high-speed suspenseful complex look at U.S. agents fighting back against an implacable enemy.The other narrative is from political commentators like The New Yorkers Jane Mayer (author of the 2008 book The Dark Side on the legal justifications and possible criminality of the Central Intelligence Agencys interrogation techniques) Academy Award-winning documentary filmmaker Alex Gibney who made Taxi to the Dark Side and CNNs Peter Bergen who wrote Manhunt The Ten Year Search for Bin Laden from 9/11 to Abbottabad. The criticism also comes from U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee chairwoman Dianne Feinstein who sent a letter co-signed by senators Carl Levin and John McCain to Sony Pictures that called the movie ""grossly inaccurate and misleading"" in suggesting that harsh interrogations produced information that led to bin Laden.In this version its suggested that the CIA shaped Zero Dark Thirty as a public-relations exercise for an organization widely associated with abuses of human rights and massive intelligence failures. Writer Mark Boal and Bigelow its suggested were ""seduced by their sources"" at the CIA.So where does the truth lie? The American film critics I believe have responded generously to a complex procedural film that seems all the more serious for being coolly dispassionate rather than conventionally triumphant about the death of the USAs enemy No. 1. As a piece of film craftsmanship its impressive if self-consciously thin on political context or character development. Scenes of information-dense talk among CIA agents in claustrophobic rooms and torture sheds alternate with jolts of suspense bomb blasts and automatic weapons. Handheld camera predominates and the chapter headings and time-line suggest a documentary realism. All this wraps up in the final 40 minutes with an unnerving real-time depiction of the Navy Seal-team raid on bin Ladens compound that has the dispassionate grimness of the excision of a tumour.At the same time the political critics on the whole are closer to the mark than the film reviewers Bigelow and Boals film seems morally tone deaf. While the film may not glorify or endorse torture it exercises a poetic licence that unwittingly or not can serve as propaganda for torture apologists. No character in the film has a qualm about inflicting suffering on prisoners in a business-as-usual world and the obvious impression is that while torturing detainees was a dirty job it was a stage in the education of Maya the fearless young woman warrior who sheds propriety overcomes obstructions and dodges death in the process of becoming the avenging figure who slays the monster.The story begins in darkness as we hear a montage of calls of the victims in the World Trade Center towers. A title announces that the movie is ""based on first-hand accounts of actual events."" The action opens two years later at a ""black site"" in a building that looks like a large utility shed where a group of figures in ski masks led by one muscular (and unmasked) man Dan (Jason Clarke) are interrogating an Arab man Ammar (Reda Kateb) whose face is bruised and whose arms are suspended by ropes from the ceiling.When they step outside briefly one of the interrogators turns out to be a slender pale red-haired young woman Maya who has just arrived. Dan tells her theres ""no shame"" in watching from the monitor but Maya is eager to go back to the interrogation and now like Dan is willing to appear unmasked. She is briefly squeamish folding her arms across her chest but when Dan slams the man down and tells her to get a jug of water to water-board the prisoner she readily complies. Later when Ammar is subjected to being stripped is put in a collar walked around like a dog or sealed in a wooden box she doesnt flinch.Why are these torture scenes which occupy about 15 minutes of the first half-hour of a 157-minute film so important? They set the post-9/11 pitiless tone establishing Mayas bona fides to her fellow agents. And they establish the drive that brings Osama bin Laden to his death because torture is shown to work. Suffering from sleep deprivation and under threat of more torture Ammar gives up the name of a courier close to bin Laden known as Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti. At the CIAs Islamabad office in a montage Maya looks at DVDs filled with detainee statements some of them by men strung up like Ammar and finds at least 20 that confirm the identity of the courier. The repetition becomes a vital link in her confidence that the courier matters.At another ""black site"" in Gdansk Poland another detainee identifies Ahmed al-Kuwaiti as a go-between for bin Laden and Abu Faraj al-Libbi (Yoav Levi) considered al-Qaedas third in command. When Pakistani intelligence captures Abu Faraj Maya gets the go-ahead to interrogate him. But Abu Faraj is unco-operative (torture doesnt always work). And Mayas mentor Dan warns her that the political winds are shifting (its now 2005) and torture is going out of style ""You dont want to be the last one caught holding a dog collar when your oversight committee comes.""The passage of years is signalled by notorious terrorist attacks the 2004 Khobar massacre in Saudi Arabia the London bus and subway bombings (2005) and the Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing (2008). In the last case we see that Maya and her rival-turned-friend (Jennifer Ehle) have met for dinner at the hotel when the bomb goes off. Its the first of a series of events when the war is brought directly to the agents. The most powerfully staged suspense sequence in the film depicts the 2009 Khost CIA-base bombing in Afghanistan where an al-Qaeda suicide bomber posing as a double agent killed seven CIA agents.That setback almost immediately stokes Mayas resolution in a memorable line of dialogue that might have come from a Bruce Willis movie ""Im going to smoke everyone involved in this op - and then Im going to kill bin Laden.""Not everything about Zero Dark Thirty zips by. The middle hour of the film feels overstuffed with agency chiefs and national security advisors gazing on the feisty Maya with avuncular admiration. There are times when the filmmakers seem to realize that in the midst of the back-and-forth between jargon-filled exposition and explosive action they need to give the strong cast a chance for some drama.Ultimately the mission seems to be more about Maya than the collective cause. When other characters arent informing us of her special dedication (""Washington says shes a killer"") she takes the time to say it herself. At one point she tells a special-operations soldier that she believes she was ""spared to finish this job.""Its Mayas struggle Mayas triumph and eventually Mayas tears as the mission comes to a close. Does she weep because theres now a bin Laden-sized hole in her life or for the soul she has lost? Its a welcome note of ambiguity in a film that cuts corners in a disturbing fashion. No doubt Zero Dark Thirty serves a function by airing Americas dirty laundry about detainee and torture programs but in its wake theres a crying need for a compassionate Coming Home to counter its brutal Deer Hunter.Whats left out matters. For anyone who has read the stories of wrongly detained and tortured men like the kidnapped and tortured Canadian engineer Maher Arar or the German car salesman Khaled El-Masri who recently won a settlement from the European Court of Human Rights Mayas tears seen misplaced.

Starring Jessica Chastain Jason Clarke Joel Edgerton Jennifer Ehle Mark Strong Kyle Chandler Edgar Ramirez Director Kathryn Bigelow Running time 237 Release Opened Jan 11 2013  Editorial Review A manhunt won by the little people By Ann HornadayFriday January 11 2013From the very first scenes of ""Zero Dark Thirty"" director Kathryn Bigelow demonstrates why she is such a formidable filmmaker as adept with human emotion as with visceral pulse-quickening action. Starting with an opening sequence that consists of a blank screen and an audio track of the anguished 911 calls of people caught in the World Trade Center towers on Sept. 11 2001 Bigelow cuts unceremoniously to a squalid prison two years later where a CIA official is mercilessly torturing a detainee. Its this harrowing scene -- during which an al-Qaeda associate is waterboarded -- that has put Bigelow and ""Zero Dark Thirty"" screenwriter Mark Boal in the middle of a bizarre political firestorm with critics from all sides accusing them of distorting the role torture played in locating Osama bin Laden. But its also during this sequence that Bigelow -- who won an Oscar in 2010 for directing the Iraq war drama ""The Hurt Locker"" -- unequivocally establishes her command presence as a filmmaker. Having profoundly evoked the tone of fear and loss that pervades and contextualizes all that comes after within a few scant minutes Bigelow signals that she will not turn away from the most unsavory aspects of the history shes chronicling and that she will lead viewers through a gnarly complicated story with authority flinty composure keen storytelling instincts and unmatched technical chops. Politicians looking for sanctimonious Monday-morning moralizing on the war on terror will be disappointed by ""Zero Dark Thirty."" So will partisan stakeholders wishing for a proxy policy debate. But anyone who appreciates movies at their most engrossing taut and well-crafted will be supremely rewarded by a film that makes a 10-year bureaucratic slog utterly riveting and in its final half-hour injects an astonishing degree of tension and suspense into a Navy SEAL raid the outcome of which is universally known. Although Boal famously based his script on first-hand interviews with military and intelligence officials who took part in the search for bin Laden ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is best appreciated not as journalism but as pure entertainment an old-fashioned espionage thriller and police procedural that possesses the added frisson of hewing closely -- but not literally -- to real-life events. Our guide is a CIA analyst named Maya (Jessica Chastain) a young agency recruit who arrives in Pakistan relatively green but whose obsession with tracking down bin Laden eventually takes on the contours of a holy mission. Maya played by Chastain with impressive resolve becomes known for mouthing off to her superiors especially her station chief in Islamabad (played by Kyle Chandler) and later to Leon Panetta (one of the films few moments of humor is Bigelows decision to cast James Gandolfini -- Tony Soprano himself -- as the director of central intelligence). It happens that Mayas character coincides closely with a real-life CIA operative who was deeply involved in the search for bin Laden. But she plays an important structural role in the film not just as the audiences surrogate through a labyrinthine collection of facts figures locations and characters but as the personification of the intelligence and military personnel who through dint of perseverance and determination finally got their man. (""Homeland"" fans conditioned to think of Maya as a neurotic sister-under-the-skin of Claire Daness Carrie will need to adjust their expectations Boal and Bigelow thankfully resist psychologizing their protagonist playing up her professionalism rather than obsessive personal quirks and piquant back stories.) And no ""Zero Dark Thirty"" does not make a case that torture led directly to a pivotal lead in getting bin Laden; if anything it shows that shoe-leather tradecraft and enlisting cooperation -- through bluffing generous treatment and outright bribery -- played far more productive roles in the hunt. ""Heres to the big breaks and the little people that make em happen"" says Mayas fellow analyst Jessica (Jennifer Ehle) a sentiment that more than any sums up ""Zero Dark Thirtys"" chief ethos. Bigelow has done an outstanding job bringing that faceless population to life enlisting a cast of charismatic young actors to bring memorable verve to otherwise dry proceedings -- including Jason Clarke as a CIA field agent Mark Strong as a CIA official Stephen Dillane as a White House security adviser and Chris Pratt and Joel and Nash Edgerton as the SEAL operators who raided the compound in Abbottabad on May 2 2011 and a half-hour later killed Osama bin Laden. Bigelow stages that sequence in virtual real time mostly with night-vision optics lending it a breathtaking air of verisimilitude. But even more awe-inspiring are the scenes that lead up to the raid as a group of CIA employees and contractors track the courier who ultimately leads them to Abbottabad a dizzying collection of street scenes that vividly convey the sheer chaos and magnitude of the haystack that hid such an all-important needle. In a few revealing flourishes Bigelow indicates that luck too played a role in that search A black cat crosses the path just before the fatal ambush at Camp Chapman in Khost Afghanistan; later a game of horseshoes and a swiftly intercepted football serve as more hopeful auguries. But by and large ""Zero Dark Thirty"" dispenses with sentimentality and speculation portraying the final mission not with triumphalist zeal or rank emotionalism but with a reserved even mournful sense of ambivalence. Just as Bigelow trusts filmgoers to think critically about American policy and the war on terror without her editorializing she leaves it to us to figure out what killing Bin Laden really meant -- the ends the means and all those unresolved data points in between that still multiply exponentially to this day. ""Where do you want to go?"" someone asks Maya in the films pointedly anti-climactic final scene. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" doesnt presume to provide an answer but it poses the question with powerful sobering force.Contains strong violence including brutal and disturbing images and for profanity.

Columbia Pictures Jessica Chastain in ""Zero Dark Thirty."" Columbia Pictures Columbia Pictures Jessica Chastain in ""Zero Dark Thirty."" Columbia Pictures Maya (Jessica Chastain) is a CIA agent whose superiors describe her as a ""killer."" Thats meant as a compliment. And thats bad news for a guy who might not be aware of her existence but will eventually pay the price for being her target Osama bin Laden.Initially taken aback by tactics that her colleagues on assignment in the Middle East employ in the war on terror -- including waterboarding -- Maya quickly adapts. From her perspective its a question not of morality but of expediency.Before long shes so committed to extracting information whatever it takes that fellow agent Dan (Jason Clarke) warns her that the folks back in Washington are getting a bit concerned about whats going on in the name of homeland security. But Maya isnt interested in politics -- and that extends to her attitude toward higher-ups with little patience for her latest ideas about where bin Laden is and how to get to him.Undeterred she comes up with a plan to bring him down. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a thrilling yet challenging film that trusts the audience to stick with it as it chronicles Mayas progress. Working from a fact-based screenplay by Mark Boal with whom she collaborated on ""The Hurt Locker"" director Kathryn Bigelow delivers a film thats exhilarating in the way that it generates tension despite the fact that we know bin Laden will indeed be caught and killed. And Chastain is terrific as a hero who just wont stop until that happens. Some have called into question the films portrayal of torture and its role in eliminating bin Laden. Without getting inside Bigelows head its reasonable to assert that to depict an injustice is not necessarily to endorse it. Unlike too many films these days ""Zero Dark Thirty"" dares to embrace complexity.And that makes it not just state-of-the-art entertainment but a great film.What ""Zero Dark Thirty""  Four stars out of four  Rating R  Run time 237  Content Strong violence including brutal disturbing images and language Find theaters and showtimes for Zero Dark Thirty Dec 27 2012 (...)

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Zero Dark Thirty"" Kathryn Bigelows chilling dramatization of the CIAs hunt for Osama bin Laden is a timely and important reminder of the agonizing human price of zealotry. It begins with sound alone recordings of 911 operators offering empty reassurances to callers inside the Twin Towers promising that help is on its way. It presses ahead as an espionage procedural with scenes of harsh interrogation by U.S. agents bomb attacks and firefight ambushes by Al-Qaida and ultimately a cinema verite-style re-creation of the U.S. Navy SEAL raid on the Pakistani compound where the terrorist mastermind was shot and killed. While it must be viewed as a work of fiction -- its portrayal of Abu Ghraib-style indignities practiced by CIA interrogators on their prisoners has drawn loud condemnation from Washington -- the film also gets a great deal right. Its representation of publicly reported events is solid. Screenwriter Mark Boal researched the story intensively and presents it authoritatively. The film moves confidently seemingly wise to the way that byzantine anti-terror intrigues were conducted over our heads and behind our backs. This is a taut crackling geopolitical thriller of a new sort. In years past great incendiary European directors like Costa-Gavras (""Z"") and Gillo Pontecorvo (""The Battle of Algiers"") created stirring fiercely partisan films and Oliver Stone (""JFK"") offered polemics from Hollywood. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" with its focus on the CIA manhunt for Bin Laden is a closer cousin to David Finchers ""Zodiac."" Its all about what spies think they know and why they think they know it procedure informants contradictory evidence dead ends. It tracks the way intelligent people sifting mountains of mind-numbing information in the hunt for a dark and dangerous menace can become ghosts of their former selves. Theres not much audience-pampering streamlining here. Watching the film you feel awash with information. Were trusted to process it all becoming part of the team as we watch sharp-eyed for the snippet that could become a breakthrough. At the center of the action is Maya a newly minted agent played by the stellar Jessica Chastain. She has no back story no love interest no real personality no life outside her quest. Chastain gives us a deft portrait of the type of person who would follow this case down a rabbit hole. Shes spooked by her first experience with extreme interrogation in which a field agent Dan (a persuasive Jason Clarke) manhandles a suspect Ammar (Reda Kateb) but she soon gets over it. In time shes fetching the pail for waterboarding. If theres a chance that applying stress will yield usable information shes for it. Some filmmakers would flash a title card reading ""Hero"" or ""Monster"" here. Bigelow and Boal present her as a do-gooder in a bad world forcing us to deal with the moral confusion ourselves. The bulk of the film consists of nuts-and-bolts detective work with sidebars of bureaucratic infighting and sudden surprise attacks followed by long periods of tense cease-fire. The chase slows as interest in Bin Laden wanes and the anti-terrorism fight shifts focus. The film shows how urgent the quest remained for the agents still in pursuit. For them Bin Laden remained Americas Most Wanted. Jonathan Olley Dml - Stationed in a covert base overseas Jessica Chastain plays a member of the elite team of spies and military operatives who secretly devoted themselves to finding Osama Bin Laden in Columbia Pictures electrifying new thriller directed by Kathryn Bigelow ZERO DARK THIRTY. The climax re-enacts the dead-of-night mission to Abbottabad from the SEALs point of view a masterstroke of sustained unnerving tension. I wanted to crawl under my seat as I watched it. What distinguishes ""Zero Dark Thirty"" from rah-rah lets kill some terrorists jingoism is its willingness to face some ugly facts. The film opens and closes with the killing of innocents -- 3000 massacred at the beginning and less than a handful of Bin Ladens relations gunned down in the nighttime raid. Maya wins but she pays a price for it. She is as haunted and unsettled leaving the case as she was signing on a decade earlier. The emotional release that comes at the fadeout isnt a fist-pump but a shudder. There is not a moment in this brilliant film that is conducive to peace of mind. ccovertstartribune.com  612-673-7186 View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal who previously collaborated on Oscar winner ""The Hurt Locker devote the last half-hour of their far superior new film to a riveting reconstruction of the Navy SEAL raid on the compound where bin Laden was killed last year. (The title is military lingo for the time of the raid 1230 a.m.) The two preceding hours tightly focus on a real-life CIA analyst -- referred to only as Maya and compellingly played by an Oscar-caliber Jessica Chastain in her first bona fide lead role in a movie -- who boldly challenges the agencys conventional wisdom. She refuses to believe that after escaping from Tora Bora following the 9/11 attack -- represented by a chilling phone call from the World Trade Center at the films outset -- bin Ladens been hiding out in an Afghan cave from which he orders a new series of international terrorist attacks. Maya is first seen watching a terrifying colleague (Jason Clarke) waterboarding and humiliating an al Qaeda money handler Ammar (Reda Kateb). The suspect pleads for mercy when the expert in ""enhanced interrogation"" leaves for a break but Maya is no weak sister. ""You can help yourself by being truthful the flame-haired analyst tells the terrorist with grim determination. Mayas superiors are skeptical when she proposes that bin Laden can be found by following couriers like the money handler -- a 10-year process with many dead ends. The bosses repeatedly put pressure on Maya to shift her focus to preventing new al Qaeda terrorist attacks. Several of them including Londons train- and bus-bombing and another that levels a hotel and nearly kills Maya are vividly depicted and give the film a tripwire sense of urgency. When Mayas only female friend in the CIA (Jennifer Ehle) is lost in an ambush she vows ""Im gonna smoke everybody involved in this op and then Im going to kill bin Laden. Maya never wavers from her determination that following an elusive courier named Abu Ahmed will eventually lead her to bin Ladens hiding place. Eventually Ahmed is tracked to Rawalpindi Pakistan -- and after a nerve-shredding pursuit to a mysterious compound in Abbottabad full of women children -- and one man who never steps outside. But while Maya is convinced that bin Laden is there most of the CIA leadership including her direct boss (Kyle Chandler) are initially unswayed. More senior experts all men insist theres a 40 percent chance at best that bin Laden is there. Maya who wont take no for an answer spends weeks relentlessly hounding her superiors as her report works its way up the chain of command. She finally gets the attention of the CIA director (James Gandolfini) by referring to herself as a ""motherf-ker at a high-level meeting. Her determination convinces him sufficiently to propose a politically risky stealth raid to the White House. Despite advance accusations from a Republican congressman that ""Zero Dark Thirty would burnish President Obamas decision to go ahead with the raid the movie does no such thing. The president is fleetingly seen during a TV interview long before the raid and neither George W. Bush nor Dick Cheney figure at all in the proceedings. Bigelow has made an essentially nonpolitical film -- far from endorsing the likes of waterboarding she and Boal leave audiences to decide for themselves whether torture was necessary to stop al Qaeda. Bigelow and Boal also rigorously eschew the kind of ""Top Gun heroics weve seen in so many movies about military missions. Maya has to cope with a bit of macho posturing even from a pair of the Navy SEALs (Chris Pratt and Joel Edgerton) when shes briefing them on the mission -- but she handles it with aplomb. And then its on to Abbottabad where Bigelow thrillingly stages the raid (shot using night-vision technology) that looks unlike anything Ive ever seen in a film. Even after doors are blown open what follows is a slow methodical room-by-room search until the SEALs prey is found and quickly eliminated. (Bin Ladens face is never shown.) In the end we know little about our heroines background except that Maya was recruited by the FBI out of high school and she isnt the "" kind of woman as she puts it who sleeps with her male colleagues. Her life is her work. Like the fictional Clarice Starling in ""The Silence of the Lambs Maya is a consummate professional who brilliantly performs her job in an often hostile work environment. So not only is ""Zero Dark Thirty one of the years best movies its an inspiring one to share with your daughters. That is if theyre old enough to deal with explicit torture scenes.

(AP) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Tuesday December 18 2012 600 AM Title Zero Dark Thirty Finding truth in ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is the opposite of seeking a needle in a haystack. Facts -- occasionally uncomfortable facts -- are what this sharp often gripping though not flawless movie about the hunt for Osama bin Laden surrounds you with. Indeed truth is the films most crucial weapon and part of director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boals objective was to make a ""journalistic movie."" Yet while that serves the film well in its tense terrific final third much of ""Zero Dark Thirty"" would be more effective if it didnt feel so remote. New CIA operative Maya (strong often silent Jessica Chastain) is standing back observing when we first see her in a Middle Eastern ""black site"" as a suspected terrorist is brutally interrogated. Doing the dirty work is Dan (gruff Jason Clarke) a guy clearly good at his job though we get the feeling hed rather not be. By this time weve already heard radio transmissions from Sept. 11 - police radios and calls from victims families. Now its 2004 and Maya is part of a dwindling team hoping any lead will get them closer to bin Laden. Their resolve is tested though we dont hear them question their tactics. And it is actually a misinterpreted bit of intel that gives Maya and her team an actual trail to follow. After false leads and further attacks the geopolitical urgency of Mayas task had waned. Then she connects a courier to the Al Qaeda leader and a compound in Pakistan. Armed with aerial photos out-on-a-limb guesswork and a gruff go-ahead from the CIA director (James Gandolfini) Maya sees a Navy SEAL team board nearly invisible helicopters to find a man whod gone unseen for years. The minute Bigelow drops us in among those copters ""Zero Dark Thirty"" -- the title is lingo for 1230 a.m. the time SEALs hit Bin Ladens compound in Abbottabad the morning of May 2 2011-- thrums into high gear. As in Bigelows ""The Hurt Locker"" this film works best when its being tactical not procedural. As a filmmaker Bigelow has a feel for individualism working within military dynamics. Politics are backburnered so justice can be done for the people being dramatized. What the film could use more of is a taste of the obsession that gripped Maya Dan (both based on real people) and certain sectors of government. Chastains assured but distant performance is never predictable yet Mayas relentless aim for the heart of darkness could have used some ""Apocalypse Now""-style foreboding . What finally sticks in the mind about ""ZDT"" is its precision. What the film says about getting information from terrorism suspects in an era of high-tech surveillance depends on your point of view. What is unquestionable is how powerful its full scope is.

"Zero Dark Thirty (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Zero Dark Thirty (R) In the end failure was not an option. Jessica Chastain in Zero Dark Thirty. Photo Columbia Pictures Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezmiamiherald.com1/3/2013 Editor rating 3.5 The ironic thing about Zero Dark Thirty director Kathryn Bigelows gripping harrowing procedural is that the movie was originally intended to be about the CIAs unsuccessful search for Osama bin Laden. Screenwriter Mark Boal (The Hurt Locker) was already deep into his script in May 2011 when the elusive terrorist was shot and killed in a Pakistani compound by U.S. Navy SEALs. Boal started rewriting immediately but to say bin Ladens death gave the story a happy ending isnt entirely accurate. Theres little patriotic rah-rah cheer or backslapping in Zero Dark Thirty This is a study of people saddled with supremely difficult jobs doing them as well as they can. Instead of trying to provide a panoramic look at the decade-long search for bin Laden Zero Dark Thirty unfolds almost entirely through the eyes of Maya (Jessica Chastain) whom we first meet as she witnesses the ""extreme interrogation"" of a suspect by a fellow agent (Jason Clark). The questioning includes water boarding sleep deprivation bondage and other forms of abuse. Maya (based on a real-life CIA agent known only as Jen) looks on quietly with the same lack of emotion as the movie does. Zero Dark Thirty takes no moral stance on the subject of torture as a means of prying usable information from suspects. The film simply shows and the lack of any bias or slant keeps the narrative from getting mired in questions of ethics and injustice. Bigelow leaves that to the viewer. That same journalistic approach extends to recreations of bombings an attack on a CIA compound and other terrorist activity during the decade the movie covers. Even more than The Hurt Locker which sometimes relied on traditional film techniques to build suspense Zero Dark Thirty resists manipulating the viewer or building movie-movie excitement. The raid on bin Ladens compound which is shown in real time primarily through night-vision goggles (essentially turning you into one of the SEALs on the mission) builds on Bigelows extensive use of the first-person point-of-view technique she used in Strange Days but to radically different effect. The sequence is alarming unnerving -- a vivid visceral illustration of the outsized courage of these soldiers. The true hero of Zero Dark Thirty however is Maya played by Chastain with an unwavering determination and perseverance that borders on the pathological. Her victory comes at a price. Maya has no apparent friends boyfriends or relatives Her co-workers are her only social outlet and theyre not exactly a fun bunch -- theyre just as single-minded as she is. Maya is as consumed with finding bin Laden as Jake Gyllenhaal was obsessed with finding a serial killer in Zodiac only he was doing it as a hobby. This search is Mayas life and by reenacting her quest in scrupulous detail Zero Dark Thirty celebrates her accomplishment and drive -- her refusal to give up where others surrendered to frustration.

By Cary Darlingdfw.comPosted 820pm on Thursday Jan. 10 2013 Thursday Jan. 10 2013 Thursday Jan. 03 2013 By Cary Darling Everyone knows how Zero Dark Thirty ends with the killing of Osama bin Laden in his Pakistani compound by SEAL Team 6.But its how it begins -- with the hauntingly effective use of voices of the 9-11 victims and then a pummeling abuse of a prisoner at a clandestine CIA ""black site"" -- that has inflamed the passions of both conservatives and liberals. Yet for the viewer its like being shoved down a dark tunnel into a shadowy world of intrigue suspicion and horror. That world comes brutally alive in Kathryn Bigelows new film a harrowing adventure behind the headlines that is at once a riveting procedural and at the same time a bracing political statement on the moral ambiguities of our war on terror.Jessica Chastain plays Maya a CIA analyst who is single-mindedly on the trail of Osama bin Laden even when her boss Joseph Bradley (Kyle Chandler) wants her to spend less time on it. Maya is introduced to the world of ""enhanced interrogation"" through another agent Dan (Jason Clarke) who lets her watch while he assaults and humiliates Ammar (Reda Kateb). At first she seems uncomfortable as if she might put a stop to it but ultimately it only seems to harden her heart and resolve.But its going to take a lot more than jailhouse savagery to get bin Laden. Its going to take gumshoe detective skills and that means everything else in Mayas life -- which were given few clues about -- is pushed aside.Its the slow piecing together of evidence -- along with the increasing urgency fueled by events such as the London bus bombing in 2005 and the Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing in 2008 -- that gives Maya the impetus to keep going.Chastain playing a very different character from the one people know her from in The Help possesses a palpable toughness even if she isnt physically overwhelming. There are a couple of moments that ring false (even if they did really happen) as when she uses a smart-mouth profanity in front of CIA director Leon Panetta (James Gandolfini). But those are overwhelmed by a performance that feels just right.Shes helped along by Clarke an Australian actor who may now zoom to star status after years of yeoman work in everything from the TV series Brotherhood to the action movie Death Race.Then theres the planning and the execution of the raid itself the back half of the film where you feel as if youre just one pair of night-vision goggles away from the two SEAL Team members we get to know best Patrick (Joel Edgerton) and Justin (Chris Pratt). As she displayed in The Hurt Locker Bigelow is an expert at capturing the claustrophobia of combat.Yet after the deed is done it doesnt feel quite celebratory for Maya. She seems to realize that the aftershock of war for her and by extension for all of us will be around for a long time.As written by Mark Boaz and envisioned by Bigelow Zero Dark Thirty is no simple action-hero victory dance around bin Ladens body. Its a powerful philosophically troubling look at recent events strained through the prism of Bigelows gripping artistic vision. Simply put Zero Dark Thirty is the best film of 2012.Exclusive AMC NorthPark Dallas; Cinemark West Plano Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

"Zero Dark Thirty Review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Zero Dark Thirty a first draft of history  Zero Dark Thirty gets 4 star review The best film of 2012 Zero Dark Thirty reviewed by Michael Phillips. (Posted Jan. 3rd 2013) The best film of 2012 Zero Dark Thirty reviewed by Michael Phillips. (Posted Jan. 3rd 2013) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune To consider what director Kathryn Bigelow has accomplished in ""Zero Dark Thirty"" imagine the events depicted by the story if theyd been given the ""Argo"" treatment.Not to take anything away from that rousing true (-ish) story of hostages freed and rights wronged and in every sense Hollywood triumphant. But think about it. If Ben Affleck or a lesser Ben Affleck had directed ""Zero Dark Thirty"" a film concluding with the raid on Osama bin Ladens compound in Abbottabad Pakistan nearly a decade following the deadly attacks of Sept. 11 2001 wed have been led down a very different moviegoing path. In ""Zero Dark Thirty"" the key American film of 2012 now going into wider release Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal -- the pair behind ""The Hurt Locker"" -- are after something truer and more lasting than getting an audience to burst into applause when the bad guys are outfoxed. Nothing in the climax of ""Zero Dark Thirty"" settles for easy triumphalism. Everything about the film is potentially controversial yet hardly any of it can be pigeonholed by way of ideology or politics.The raid on bin Ladens compound much of it filmed through an approximation of night-vision goggles necessarily sidelines the films main character Central Intelligence Agency operative Maya played by Jessica Chastain. This is an odd thing for a movie even a fact-based movie to do to its protagonist. It is also the honest thing. With the same bittersweet artistry Bigelow and company lend their prologue we return briefly to the main characters wary and exhausted company after the raid. She is a heroine (conflicted perhaps; how conflicted is up to the viewer) behind the heroes. The prologue begins in darkness and then fades into panicked voices. In a brilliant sound collage of telephone conversations back and forth from those trapped in the World Trade Center towers the horror of that morning comes rushing back. Then quickly were in Pakistan. Maya is the new kid in town learning enhanced interrogation techniques (torture by any other name) and other tricks of the trade from her fellow CIA operative played by Jason Clarke. ""Theres no shame if you want to watch through the monitor"" he tells her. She declines. The waterboarding begins. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" its title taken from military phraseology for 1230 a.m. is our monitor the prism through which we see this world.We know little of Mayas past just as we knew little of the bomb detonation expert played by Jeremy Renner in ""The Hurt Locker."" Bigelow and Boal are interested in the present tense and experiences rather than explanations. As a tough old-school CIA operative the marvelous Jennifer Ehle shares a scene in a hotel bar with Chastain that hints at Mayas obsessive nature and blinkered personality. The way that scene ends is the essence of this coolly startling picture one devoted to intelligence gathering of various methods some effective some amoral under the most volatile imaginable conditions.Bigelow casts all sorts of solid and familiar actors in all sorts of roles including Kyle Chandler as the CIAs Islamabad overseer trying to decide which of his employees hunches to take most seriously. The Navy SEALs who enter the action in the final round are played by among others Joel Edgerton and Chris Pratt. As for Chastain she is by now a full-on movie star as well as an unusually versatile and gifted actress. Hers may be a largely reactive role but on screen Chastain can do almost anything. Better than that she understands how much is needed in any given encounter. Here less is enough.The naturalistic style of the picture owes a lot to the Olivier Assayas terrorist film ""Carlos"" and the actor who played the title character in that picture Edgar Ramirez shows up here as one of Mayas skeptical colleagues. Bigelow a master of complicated lines and crosscurrents of physical action doesnt treat everything leading up to the raid as a preamble or a necessary evil. The lead-up is after all the majority of the film. We move from one country to another from one CIA ""black site"" to another with Mayas frustrations guiding the narrative. The years and the casualties mount. Events depicted in the film notably the waterboarding have been debated from every side both for their factual accuracy (not that anyones complaining about the hogwash content in ""Argo"") and their political implications. I assure you Although ""Zero Dark Thirty"" ends with the sight of a (metaphorical) bloodstained flag behind its elusive protagonist its stance is extremely tricky. Its not a documentary. Its not a load of revenge nonsense. Its not ""24."" Im still arguing with myself over parts of it.And thats a sign that a movie will endure.mjphillipstribune.comZero Dark Thirty -- 4 starsMPAA rating R (for strong violence including brutal disturbing images and for language)Running time 237Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Entertainment Movies Zero Dark Thirty (movie) Central Intelligence Agency Argo Osama bin Laden The Hurt Locker (movie) Best movies of 2012 Worst movies of 2012 10 movies to see over the holidays Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising76deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-1231-zero-dark-thirty-20130103,0,2020026.column",200,zerodarkthirty15,zerodarkthirty,chicagotribune

Cast Jessica Chastain Jason Clarke Chris Pratt. Rating R for strong violence including brutal disturbing images and for language. RELATED NEWS Interview Jessica Chastain Trailer Zero Dark Thirty By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Fri Jan 4 2013 810 AM ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a great movie an astonishing achievement on nearly every level.Its also a controversial one generating heated debate about the intentions of the filmmakers director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal. Their film follows the long frustrating and for years fruitless search for Osama bin Laden; the film was started before he was found and killed.The movie begins in haunting fashion with the screen dark for a couple of minutes. We hear frantic phone calls from people trapped in the World Trade Center a riveting reminder of the attacks that set the search for bin Laden in motion.Bigelow immediately fast-forwards a couple of years to a CIA camp where a captured al-Qaida operative is being tortured. An agent (Jason Clarke) demands information telling his prisoner he ""owns"" him. The prisoner is humiliated waterboarded stuffed into a tiny wooden crate all to no avail. (Much more on this later.)With the agent is a figure in a black ski mask. When they walk outside the mask is removed. It is a woman Maya (Jessica Chastain). We know nothing about her personal life; we never really do. She is single-minded of purpose Find bin Laden. As we see her move through the film this is unchanging. It is what she does it is who she is. We know almost nothing else about her.It sounds like a lack of character development but Chastain is so good that we are riveted. She is as tough or tougher than any of the men she works with who learn to stay out of her way. And the fact that she is a woman is an added humilation to the al-Qaida operatives she leans on for information.Maya who like the other operatives relies on what the U.S. government would call ""enhanced"" interrogation techniques hits upon an idea that she cant shake If bin Laden doesnt use cellphones or computers he must rely on a courier. Find the courier find bin Laden.No one else buys it and for years the trail stays cold. Leads are followed people die. But the dogged Maya wont give up. Finally a tip. It takes a long time to convince the government bureaucracy to buy in (James Gandolfini has a nice turn as the CIA director with no time for niceties) but eventually a raid is approved on a home in Pakistan.This takes up the last quarter or so of a two-hour-and-37-minute movie and its nail-you-to-your-seat riveting. (Bigelow and Boal teamed for the Oscar-winning movie ""The Hurt Locker."") The Navy SEAL team that infiltrates the compound where bin Laden is hiding is ruthless efficient and successful. Yet not celebratory This was a job that took years and billions but to these guys its still a job.Not to Maya. Its her life. But to her also part of the business part of the game.At question is the role that torture played in getting the information that led to bin Ladens discovery. We see it in graphic fashion. The tactics seems futile and another attack occurs.Later the offer of food and a cigarette yields more useful results. Does this mean the lighter touch worked? Or that the prisoner was so utterly broken by earlier torture that he gave up the information out of fear?The U.S. government is adamant that torture did not lead to bin Ladens detection though it acknowledges that ""enhanced"" interrogation techniques took place. Its not clear in the film that the methods led to much of anything.It is abundantly clear however that ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is not a glorification of torture. It is not a glorification of anything particularly. Instead its a long hard look at people going about their job methodically sometimes obsessively until they get what they want.It is intense its thought-provoking and its important. All told a brilliant movie.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

Hunting bin Laden and history in Zero Dark Thirty Swift smart relentless Zero Dark Thirty compresses a decade of high-stakes procedural into 157 minutes of pure momentum. In the process it emerges as a rare and welcome creature in this the age of movie bloat a long film that feels short.The thriller about the hunt for Osama bin Laden marks the second collaboration between director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal. Where 2008s Hurt Locker thrived as an episodic heart-in-the-stomach character study of a reckless explosives expert (Jeremy Renner) in Iraq Zero works on a more epic scale. Gliding from ""black site"" interrogation dungeons to crowded Pakistan streets to Washington D.C. office spaces its the story of a long and often desperate slog.Bigelow and Boal specialize in characters consumed with dangerous and demanding work. The key player here is Maya (a steely sensational Jessica Chastain) a young CIA agent who gradually shifts from queasy observer of torture to obsessive manhunter. Her fellow hunters include a jaded interrogator (Jason Clarke) the tightly wound CIA station chief in Islamabad (Kyle Chandler) and an optimistic intelligence officer (Jennifer Ehle).Their task isnt pretty and Zero Dark Thirty doesnt try to soften it up. Pundits and U.S. senators have attacked the movies suggestion that torture yielded intelligence that led to bin Ladens 2011 killing but theres nothing heroic about the black-site sequences. Theyre shot to accentuate a mounting feeling of sensory deprivation. One scene acknowledges the idea that a torture victim might say anything to stop the pain.If you seek a hard-facts approach to torture some great documentaries are out there including Taxi to the Dark Side and Standard Operating Procedure. With its composite characters and emphasis on dramatic tension Zero Dark Thirty isnt a work of nonfiction though the gritty sense of reportage -- Boal was a journalist before he became a screenwriter -- is key to its success. Trails of intelligence tips and informants lead to high hopes and dead ends; authorization is sought to take the next steps as higher-ups sift through the risks and potential rewards. The combination of process intensity and human drama reminds me of The Wire David Simons late great HBO series about cops criminals politicians and bureaucrats in drug-ravaged Baltimore.Bigelow and Boal were set to make a film about the failed hunt for bin Laden. Then in May 2011 came the news that SEAL Team Six had killed the 9/11 architect in a daring late-night raid in Abbottabad. This episode provides Zero Dark Thirtys riveting capstone a meticulous 25-minute sequence of ghostly sights and sounds much of the action filtered through night-vision goggles. Its where cinematographer Greig Fraser and film editors William Goldenberg and Dylan Tichenor really earn their keep though the films craft level is sky-high from start to finish.Thats what you really need to know about Zero Dark Thirty. Its an exceptionally well-constructed movie that defies inevitable attempts to politicize or stir up the controversy pot. Its a welcome reminder that sometimes anyway quality still wins out in the end.Follow Chris Vognar on Twitter at chrisvognar.ZERO DARK THIRTY(A) Directed by Kathryn Bigelow.

Comments (1) click to enlarge Zero Dark Thirty Recommended Video Rated R  157 minutes  2013 Kathryn Bigelow follows her Oscar-winning The Hurt Locker with this gripping account of the search for Osama bin Laden focusing on bureaucratic infighting at the CIA as the political winds shift and new intelligence brings Seal Team Six to bin Ladens door. Jessica Chastain plays a CIA officer who grows more obsessed with each al Qaeda attack and persuaded that bin Laden is hiding in Abbottabad Pakistan crosses swords with Islamabad station chief Kyle Chandler in her determination to move on the intelligence. The stomach-turning scenes of waterboarding that open the film have already embroiled it in controversy with John McCain Diane Feinstein and Carl Levin disputing the movies veracity and others denouncing it as pro-torture. That debate will continue but at the very least Bigelow has widened her reach past the white-knuckle thrills of The Hurt Locker and into the darkest currents of American military might--at the risk of being swept away.

For all the political talk of the War on Terror its a war that remains largely an abstraction in post-9/11 America with long periods of relative silence punctuated by occasional news of a terrorist attack overseas. Zero Dark Thirty the stunning new film by director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal has been widely and accurately described as a ""procedural"" an intercontinental detective story about the hunt for Osama bin Laden. But it is also an unconventional war movie about an unconventional war one in which those on the front lines are not principally soldiers and marines but intelligence analysts and operatives. For them the war is not a series of loosely connected news events but a daily agonizing reality. Related Story The 10 Best Movies of 2012 It is already difficult to discuss Zero Dark Thirty without discussing its attendant controversies and I wont try. But before wading into these let me say that judged purely on cinematic grounds Zero Dark Thirty is a tour de force and the best film of the year. Bigelow and Boals prior collaboration The Hurt Locker was extraordinary in its execution but relatively narrow in its ambitions a series of snapshots from a life lived at unthinkable extremes. With Zero Dark Thirty the filmmakers bring the same meticulous eye and sense of harrowing immediacy to a story of vastly greater scope. At the center of the film is Maya (Jessica Chastain) a young CIA analyst of undisguised talent and obstinacy. We first meet her in 2003 when a veteran interrogator named Dan (Jason Clarke) introduces her to the savage realities of the Agencys detainee program. ""When you lie to me"" he tells Ammar (Reda Kateb) a captive with possible links to al Qaeda ""I hurt you."" Its a promise fulfilled with the now all-too-familiar litany of brutal techniques beatings waterboarding stress positions extremes of cold and dark sexual humiliation sleep deprivation mind games. ""Its gonna take a while"" Dan explains to Maya. ""He has to learn how helpless he is.""Eventually Ammar produces a name Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti and the film enters its long second act its procedural phase in which leads are followed lost and rediscovered. Maya (a character based on a genuine CIA analyst whose identity remains classified) is convinced that Abu Ahmed is a courier with direct ties to bin Laden. But her superiors are unpersuaded and her consequent insubordinations become progressively more explicit. Years tick by as the story winds it way through Islamabad and Kuwait City through Langley Virginia and a ""black site"" in Gdansk Poland.Zero Dark Thirty unlike so many other offerings of this holiday season earns every minute of its two-and-a-half-hour-plus running time. Until May 2 2011 when Mayas tenacious conviction is vindicated in a walled compound in Abbottabad. Here in the movies final act Bigelow dramatizes the bin Laden raid with all the meticulous care of the Seal Team 6 squad that preceded her muffled Blackhawks thrum across the Khyber Pass; night vision paints the blackness a queasy green; explosives are set shots fired and blood spilled. Zero Dark Thirty is like the story it chronicles a sprawling enterprise--one that unlike so many other offerings of this holiday season earns every minute of its two-and-a-half-hour-plus running time. The large cast encompasses Jennifer Ehle Kyle Chandler Mark Strong Joel Edgerton Chris Pratt Harold Perrineau Edgar Ramirez James Gandolfini and too many others to catalog. As Dan the ambivalent interrogator the Australian-born Clarke is particularly notable building on the work he did earlier this year in Lawless. Chastains Maya though remains a bit of a cipher. The actress is good as always and it is a relief that her character has not been burdened with backstory. Yet something is missing some telling idiosyncrasy especially when she makes her most forceful declarations. (Explaining her attendance at an Abbottabad briefing she tells the CIA chief ""Im the motherfucker who found this place."") For all Chastains gifts Maya comes across less as an individual than as the expression of an idea the woman who must be tough enough to survive in a male environment a topic about which Bigelow knows more than a little.As for Bigelow herself her direction is vital controlled enthralling. If The Hurt Locker cracked the door on her cinematic gifts Zero Dark Thirty kicks it wide open. Boals script meanwhile is a comparable marvel gripping yet utterly authentic.But the film is not of course authentic in the most literal sense which brings us to the overlapping controversies it has engendered. The first erupted long before the movie even screened when news broke that the Obama administration had granted Bigelow and Boal access to classified information and opponents of the president charged that the movie would amount to pro-White House propaganda. Their concern was misplaced Obama appears only once on a TV screen in the background and his presence is ironic at best.But the filmmakers extraordinary access raises other more troubling questions. Bigelow and Boal have presented their filmmaking process as ""journalistic"" while at the same time stressing that the resulting movie is a work of fiction not a documentary. The problem as Peter Maass and others have noted is that it is impossible to know where the journalism ends and the fiction begins in short where the filmmakers have been privy to secrets shared by the CIA and where theyve simply made things up. Compounding such concerns is the sense in many quarters that Zero Dark Thirty is at least implicitly pro-torture--that it shows that ""waterboarding works."" I confess that my initial response was very nearly the opposite No one I thought who sits through the films early excruciating scenes will ever again claim (as many advocates of ""enhanced interrogation"" did) that waterboarding does not constitute torture. Moreover unless I misremember it is neither waterboarding nor other physical abuse that results in Ammars eventual confession but rather the kindness and trickery that follow. (Though one can of course argue that it is only the abuse that makes the later trickery possible.) Several writers have also cited as evidence of pro-torture bias a scene in which a peripheral CIA agent complains after the detainee program is shut down that intelligence will be harder to obtain. But I was equally struck by another moment. The CIA director (Gandolfini) convenes a meeting to assess the likelihood that bin Laden will be found at the Abbottabad compound and the most skeptical of all those sitting around the table is Dan himself who places the odds at a ""soft 60"" percent. The very person who conducted the initial interrogation in other words is the one least convinced by the intelligence it gleaned.Which is not to say that I necessarily disagree with critics of the portrait painted by the film; rather that I am conflicted and eager to see it a second time with their complaints in mind. With Zero Dark Thirty Bigelow and Boal have produced a powerful morally complicated work on an urgent subject. It is a film that deserves--that almost demands--to be seen and argued over.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Do our Facebook posts reflect our true personalities? Incrementally probably not. But in aggregate the things we say on social media paint a fairly accurate portrait of our inner selves. A team of University of Pennsylvania scientists is using Facebook status updates to find commonalities in the words used by different ages genders and even psyches. The so-called ""World Well-Being Project"" started as an effort to gauge happiness across various states and communities. ""Governments have an increased interest in measuring not just economic outcomes but other aspects of well-being"" said Andrew Schwartz a UPenn computer scientist who works on the project.

The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s.

The critics have spoken (well some of them anyway) declaring the overrated Zero Dark Thirty the most important movie of the year. I wish I could agree but I dont. Its about the 10-year hunt for Osama bin Laden which makes it important. But its the theme that earns stature and attention not the movie. Movies must move and this one just lies there like a stack of paper from a classified government filing cabinet. Like The Hurt Locker the previous film by the overrated team of writer Mark Boal and director Kathryn Bigelow its not really a movie. Its not really a documentary either because it assigns names to characters that may or may not be real and pretends to have a narrative arc. For lack of a better tag I guess its journalism which is a completely different thing. Journalism is the orderly collecting and dispensing of facts not filmmaking. Zero Dark Thirty has the facts (or at least Ms. Bigelows interpretation of them) but theres nothing progressive or original about the way they are dramatized. And we know how it ends already. They killed him. Supposedly based on first-hand accounts of actual events (although who is willing to step forward and deny them under oath?) at least two-thirds of a movie that is exhausting to begin with is a dense dossier on CIA activity. It goes so far back that you hear the anguished voices of victims in the 9/11 attacks on the collapsing World Trade Center then cuts abruptly to two years later when a rookie agent named Maya (Jessica Chastain) arrives in the Middle East to observe how her colleagues extract information from their prisoners in a manner that goes against every peace treaty known to man. Sparing no detail too dark or heinous to protect the faint of heart Ms. Bigelow zooms in on the intricacies of waterboarding sleep deprivation for 96 hours forced wearing of dog collars and other severe tortures inflicting agony and humiliation on al Qaeda prisoners then bogs the film down in a lot of techno-jargon and aerial shots of the tribal territories of Afghanistan shot in locations as far afield as Jordan India and Langley Va. After long drawn-out scenes depicting the capture of Abu Faraj al-Libbi and the track bombing that destroyed the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad the film catalogues both al Qaeda and American fatalities including a mother of three played by the marvelous Jennifer Ehle. It takes a lot of time before the thrilling final scenes of the fatal showdown in bin Ladens hideout in Pakistan on May 2 2011 when a team of Navy SEALs referred to as ""canaries"" breaks in guns down women and children and finds and liquidates their target. The problem with an overload of research both documented and assumed for dramatic license is how to blend historic facts in some way that is more interesting and cinematic than people sitting around conference tables talking. Its a problem that also plagues Lincoln and neither Steven Spielberg nor Ms. Bigelow has found a way to move beyond those stale static limitations. Day-to-day routines of CIA operatives following every lead are interspersed with TV broadcasts cellphone transmissions and endless faces relaying information. I hate to admit it but I found dozing off irresistible. Dullness was less of a problem however than the fake premise that the search location invasion and murder of the worlds most despised villain since Adolf Hitler was due almost exclusively to the obsessive persistence of a girl named Maya. Its her detective work that gets her superior removed from field duty and sent home from the Middle East convinces the government to chip in unbelievable sums of money to keep the investigation active and leads to the safe house in Abbottabad where bin Laden is found and killed. I have no doubt that there were both women and men assigned by the CIA to this tense 10-year ordeal but there is no evidence that it was the exclusive work of one woman. If such a person existed she would be the most famous person in the world a best-selling author and talk-show sensation and land on the cover of Time. Yet Ms. Bigelows inducement to turn a group effort into a feminist triumph is the fictional leap of faith Zero Dark Thirty hinges on. The conceit of the movie is that it was one woman with a driving passion--and a young inexperienced field operative to boot--who practically single-handedly discovered the evidence and masterminded the plan that led to bin Ladens assassination. We know nothing about Maya and Ms. Chastains stoic textbook approach to the role does nothing to illuminate or enlighten. I admire the films austere night-vision camerawork and precision timing of the raid on the bin Laden compound as well as the Boal-Bigelow teams resistance to embellish the narrative with a Hollywood love story or a history of everyone who worked on the worlds most daunting manhunt. But as a realistic political thriller about Americans in harms way it is not half as suspenseful or entertaining as Argo. We may never know the truth about how we found bin Laden but I still believe what we do know makes a strong enough story on its own without Wonder Woman. rreedobserver.com ZERO DARK THIRTY Running Time 157 minutes Written by Mark Boal Directed by Kathryn Bigelow Starring Chris Pratt Jessica Chastain and Joel Edgerton Comment Filed under movie Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Pussy Riot On Their Provocative Donald Trump-Inspired Art Installation Culture The (Real) Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia Origin Story Culture Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://observer.com/2012/12/bagging-bin-laden-zero-dark-thirty/,200,zerodarkthirty24,zerodarkthirty,com/2012/12/bagging-bin-laden-zero-dark-thirty/

Spoiler alert We got him. But that goes to the problem director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal faced with this project once Team Six wrote their ending for them How do you keep an audience interested now? Well if youre Bigelow and Boal you dig in finding your own special entry point. For Bigelow its a portrait of the kind of tough woman she used to specialize in; for Boal its the sort of embedded info-crammed journalism he sprang from. So from him we get a lot of details studded with acronyms but often a little scant on context and explanation. (If you have trouble telling who some of these people are working for or remembering that ""ISI"" is Pakistans spy agency - well dont feel alone.) But from her we get what Bigelow has always done best as she focuses on men under fire (""The Hurt Locker"" ""K-19 The Widowmaker"") and women working twice as hard to survive in that male world (""Blue Steel"" ""Strange Days""). And her style carries along Boals sometimes dense plotting. So too do the performances. There are some interesting characters around the edges here. Like Jason Clarke as the first U.S. interrogator we meet and one very calmly brutal guy. Or Joel Edgerton as a Navy SEAL leader the actor finally getting to use some of his quiet charisma. But driving this movie is Jessica Chastain as Maya the CIA analyst who becomes convinced early that the way to Bin Laden is through his most trusted courier. And who redoubles her efforts once Al Qaedas attacks begin to strike even closer to home. Chastain is a chameleon of an actor who just last year moved easily from the fluttery bombshell of ""The Help"" to the worried wife of ""Take Shelter."" But she also excels at steely determination too - something she also showed as the Israeli assassin in ""The Debt"" and as the stoic military wife in ""Coriolanus."" Shes determined here and the part also gives her a chance to do something the movies really havent before - really lose it eyes flashing lips spitting out threats and curses. Its a performance with a lot of colors and angles and is guaranteed to be remembered come awards time. Mayas a real character all right. But is she a real person? Although this story is based on first-hand accounts (and facts so accurate it drew criticism from some politicians) its hard to believe that the hunt for Bin Laden really came down to one junior agent who refused to give up when others were willing to move on. And the scenes of her taking on her superiors (including the director of the CIA) and angrily writing missed deadlines on the glass walls of their offices? Good drama but probably pretty sketchy as far as typical career-agent behavior goes. But other things feel very right and very honest. The scenes of the interrogations? Brutal but presented without judgment which has already offended some critics who are calling the film pro-torture (its not - its pro-fact). The political decisions at home? As full of worry and bravado and second-guessing as youd imagine. And then we move on to the actual assault led by Edgerton and we get the Bigelow action fans remember from entertainments like ""Near Dark"" and ""Point Break"" - adrenaline-rushed sequences shot closeup and cleanly edited. (And in this case backed by Alexandre Desplats classic suspense score which sounds a little like non-Bond John Barry). The long road to that sequence which takes up the movies last half hour is sometimes rocky. Its probably a mistake in the midst of all these shape-shifting actors to cast someone as distinctive as James Gandolfini in a small part. His celebrity takes you out of the movies realism -- just as Boals overly detailed realism sometimes slows down the drama. But then we get on those copters heading into Pakistan. And the art of ""Zero Dark Thirty"" - and of Kathryn Bigelow - is that were suddenly on edge worrying wondering if somehow this time around the story is really going to end a different way. Ratings note The film contains violence strong language and nudity. Zero Dark Thirty (R) Columbia (157 min.) Directed by Kathryn Bigelow. With Jessica Chastain Joel Edgerton.

"""Zero Dark Thirty"" tracks Osama bin Ladens takedown movie review - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Movie review Zero Dark Thirty tracks Bin Ladens dramatic takedown Zero Dark Thirty Movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews Zero Dark Thirty Kenneth Turan reviews Zero Dark Thirty Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic ""Zero Dark Thirty"" does focus on as the ads insist ""the greatest manhunt in history"" but once youve seen this film a woman -- or maybe two -- will be on your mind.Following up on her Oscar-winning ""The Hurt Locker"" director Kathryn Bigelow proves herself once again to be a master of heightened realism and narrative drive in this retelling of the decade-long search for Osama bin Laden. The films concluding section -- a crisp re-creation of the Navy SEAL assault on the Pakistani compound where the wily mastermind lived and died -- has been much-publicized and the films depiction of torture has already become a tempest in a teapot. But those elements are both overshadowed by the performance of Jessica Chastain as the CIA operative who made the raid possible.BUZZMETER Zero Dark Thirtys Oscar chances Chastain Oscar-nominated for ""The Help"" last year is a known quantity but like Jennifer Lawrence (her likely Academy Award rival this time around) she is a complete chameleon able to vanish into a variety of roles so different from one another that the switch of persona can be disconcerting.Here Chastain plays Maya a CIA officer who quite literally devotes every waking moment of her life to finding and destroying Bin Laden. Her single-minded ferocity and stubbornness not only prove essential in the hunt but also make up the emotional through line that engages us in the story of ""Zero Dark Thirty.""What is most exciting about Maya is that screenwriter Mark Boal (who collaborated with Bigelow on ""Hurt Locker"") has shrewdly written her less like a heroine and more like an archetypal big-screen hero.Maya doesnt have a boyfriend or any kind of life outside her work and Boals script conspicuously avoids burdening her with either a teary breakdown or a glib series of reasons to explain the way she acts. Icy formidable with a gaze that could melt steel and the sharpest tongue in town she is a force among forces and Chastain makes her frankly thrilling to behold. If the way ""Zero"" carefully constructs Maya as a legend in her own time is classic hero-building the scripts approach to telling the manhunt story is as modern as it gets.PHOTOS Zero Dark Thirty premiereBoal a former journalist has researched these events so thoroughly that the eager press notes suggest ""Zero Dark Thirty"" should be thought of as ""a unique kind of motion picture the reported film."" Be that as it may viewers whove followed events in that part of the world will recognize specific situations -- the 2008 bombing of the Marriott Islamabad in Pakistan the 2009 suicide attack on Afghanistans Camp Chapman that claimed several CIA agents -- before they play out.What is especially contemporary about ""Zero Dark Thirtys"" story line is that Boals script begins by tossing us into the deep end thrusting us right into the middle of a complicated situation and forcing us to trust that well eventually make sense of the welter of meetings brutal interrogations and Middle Eastern names were confronted with.One reason Boal makes such a potent combination with Bigelow is that her directing style moves us right along. She is so good with both action and creating a convincing look and feel for the film that the time it takes to get up to speed with the complicated plot does not feel like a problem.Though in general ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is not as interested in exploring personality as ""Hurt Locker"" was the one exception is Maya a character based on a real person but also bolstered by the films sense that the role women played in the Bin Laden hunt has not been sufficiently recognized.Maya is introduced in 2003 two years after 9/11 showing up at a so-called black site an undisclosed CIA interrogation location. A more veteran colleague Dan remarks that shes wearing her ""best suit just off the plane from D.C.""LIST Best films of 2012 | Kenneth TuranDan (convincing Australian actor Jason Clarke) is the CIA agent in charge of whats come to be known as ""enhanced interrogation techniques."" In these days during the George W. Bush administration Dan is shown applying all kinds of severe physical abuse including water-boarding to a detainee named Ammar (played by Reda Kateb memorable as the drug-dealing Jordi in ""A Prophet."")This torture is quite painful to watch as it is being administered but on the whole its not shown to be particularly effective as a means of obtaining information. Though the overall result is to induce repugnance in the viewer these scenes exist because of the effect they have on fresh-off-the-boat Maya Initially unnerved she soon gets her bearings and gets to work. If ""Zero Dark Thirty"" (named after military-speak for the time of the Bin Laden raid) has any message its that what is effective is Mayas meticulous painstaking gathering of information over nearly a decade -- a thankless process not always done with support from her bosses that led to the identification of a man named Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti as the courier who personally delivered information to the Al Qaeda leader.You know youre watching a movie when what was doubtless a tremendously tedious process in real life is made as exciting as all get-out. This salute to what one character calls ""big breaks and the little people who make them happen"" is an example of cinematic storytelling at its most effective.

Jonathan Olley/Sony Pictures hide caption toggle caption Jonathan Olley/Sony Pictures Zero Dark Thirty Director Kathryn Bigelow Genre Action Running time 157 minutes Rated R for strong violence including brutal disturbing images and for language. With Chris Pratt Jessica Chastain Joel Edgerton (Recommended) With the screen pitch-black at the start of Zero Dark Thirty we hear the confusion and alarm of Sept. 11 2001 News reports that a plane has hit the World Trade Center then the voices of a 911 operator reassuring a frightened trade center worker that shell be OK though she wont. When the screen finally brightens its for a grim ""black site"" interrogation half a world away -- a nephew of Osama bin Laden (Reda Kateb) strung up from the ceiling bruised and bloodied finally cut down only so that he can be waterboarded and stuffed into a tiny crate. Witnessing all this is a fresh-off-the-plane CIA tracker Maya played with fierceness and virtually no back story by Jessica Chastain. This first interrogation leaves her outwardly shaken but once she settles in she exhibits single-mindedness and inner resolve enough to weather all the investigative blind alleys ahead. ""You dont think shes a little young for the hard stuff?"" the interrogator (Jason Clarke) asks their boss (Kyle Chandler). ""Washington"" he replies flatly ""says shes a killer."" That proves literally true though not for years yet. Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal director and writer of The Hurt Locker will first send their heroine through a bureaucratic and ethical minefield -- one where a colleagues misstep proves fatal the investigative terrain changes daily and her superiors all have blind spots even as to the wisdom of going after bin Laden. i CIA operative Joseph Bradley (Kyle Chandler) discusses a sensitive operation with Dan (Jason Clarke). Jonathan Olley/Sony Pictures hide caption toggle caption Jonathan Olley/Sony Pictures CIA operative Joseph Bradley (Kyle Chandler) discusses a sensitive operation with Dan (Jason Clarke). Jonathan Olley/Sony Pictures That she will prevail we know going in. But the hows and whys make Zero Dark Thirty a riveting investigative procedural for its first two hours with a host of secondary players -- particularly Jennifer Ehle as a more experienced tracker who strikes up a friendship with Maya -- making brief but indelible impressions. And the payoff coming in the final 40 minutes after Navy SEALs plunge in stealth helicopters through a mountain range in inky blackness toward Abbottabad is almost more startling than anything that went before. Every action movie youve ever seen has prepared you for a rush through doors and up stairs when they get to the bin Laden compound. But thats not what happened in real life. So shooting in night-vision greens and blacks Bigelow shows us what did happen -- a careful painstaking methodical assault thats made cinematically pulse-quickening not by Hollywood flash but by the operations very slowness and discipline in the face of a gathering angry crowd. No one who saw The Hurt Locker would expect these filmmakers to turn the hunt for the worlds most notorious terrorist into a rah-rah get-the-bad-guy thriller. But the degree of complexity they bring to their story starting with that opening terrorist violence meets cruel interrogations juxtaposition and extending to the killings in Abbottabad has to be counted a surprise in a major Hollywood film. Was the death of Osama bin Laden worth the moral price the compromised ideals? The filmmakers could hardly avoid raising those questions but they pointedly leave them for the audience to answer. This is not a triumphant story in their telling but it is one uncommonly freighted with the weight of history.

The time leading up to this tense sequence carried out by Navy SEALs is spent in clinical procedural wrangling in a no-frills style.While this decade-long look at the inner workings of the CIA ( 1/2 out of four; rated R; opening Wednesday in New York and Los Angeles) is intriguing the movie would have benefited by more character development and additional editing.BOWLES Zero Dark Thirty has bin Laden Oscars in its sightsMOVIE FORUM The Nomination Domination EditionDirector Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal (the duo behind the brilliant The Hurt Locker) re-teamed for this film which while ambitious lacks the visceral punch of that 2009 best picture winner.Each segment is introduced by a chapter title in the lead-up to the assault on bin Ladens suburban Pakistani compound. It follows a dedicated team of CIA analysts particularly Maya (Jessica Chastain) who works a hunch for years. Inspired by an actual CIA analyst that Boal found while researching the film Maya is resolute about bin Ladens whereabouts while her colleagues waver in their certainty. She impatiently keeps track of the raids bureaucratic delays in glaring red marker (over 100 days).But Chastains performance doesnt always match the laser focus of her character. There is an irksome blankness to her portrayal. In contrast her fellow operative Dan (Jason Clarke) comes across much more vividly.If Maya is based on a real person why does she come off as a robo-CIA agent? Perhaps thats by design a statement on the culture of the organization since others in the CIA sometimes refer to her as ""the girl."" But as an audience we need to know more about this lead character in order to root for and feel for her.Early on there are scenes of graphic torture in which Dan punches and eventually waterboards a suspect (Reda Kateb). The brutal behavior is meant to be key to bin Ladens capture. However Senate Intelligence Committee chair Sen. Dianne Feinstein has denied that waterboarding helped in this case. This is a movie that claims to be faithfully based on facts but the filmmakers cant have it both ways.Natural lighting and a handheld camera provide stunning shots and dramatic sound design (particularly when helicopters descend on the bin Laden compound) adds to the tension. When the raid finally happens its riveting as seen through night vision goggles.The story is long and is more admirable than enjoyable as it jumps around the Middle East. Some of the side missions and digressions seem unnecessary particularly the re-creation of terrorist events like the London bombings.Theres an emotional detachment to the film that undercuts its potency. Zero Dark Thirty is more technically proficient than emotionally involving.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Director Kathryn Bigelow and the cast of Zero Dark Thirty discuss their bin Laden raid docudrama opening in limited release Dec. 19.

The trick comes in offering a new perspective on familiar events or at least generating suspense in a way that makes us nervous that Apollo 13 might not land safely even when history tells us otherwise. ""Argo"" and ""Lincoln"" are two films that successfully tread these waters and now comes ""Zero Dark Thirty"" Kathryn Bigelows eagerly awaited follow-up to ""The Hurt Locker."" She and screenwriter Mark Boal have consciously chosen to take a just-the-facts-maam approach to the manhunt and subsequent killing of Osama bin Laden and while theres no denying the skill with which theyve gone about telling the tale the results are simultaneously uninvolving and somewhat infuriating. Also read Kathryn Bigelow Denies Zero Dark Thirty Apologizes for Torture (Exclusive) Uninvolving to some extent because the people in this movie are not so much characters as they are plot functionaries chess pieces that move around strategically to capture their target. Jessica Chastain stars as Maya a CIA agent who with each passing year grows more determined to nab the man behind the 9/11 attacks. Theres nothing wrong with this style of storytelling -- giving us some backstory about Mayas taste in men or love of antique cars or whatever wouldnt necessarily add anything to what Bigelow and Boal are trying to do here -- but its a gamble that doesnt quite pay off. After spending its first half getting into the false leads and call-tracing and all the nitty-gritty of a manhunt ""Zero Dark Thirty"" subjects its capable lead character to the requisite scene in which she snaps and barks at her bureaucrat boss (played by Kyle Chandler) that shes so close and not to take her off the case. Its a moment that feels like it might have come from any given episode of ""Homeland"" or any TNT show about a plucky female cop and it capsizes a movie that until that point had been a fairly fascinating examination of the unglamorous sausage-making that goes into a worldwide search for a terrorist. Also read Zero Dark Thirty Wont Be Hurt Locker at the Box Office The somewhat infuriating facet comes early on as we watch Maya observe seasoned interrogator Dan (Jason Clarke giving a fascinating performance) torture terror suspects to find out what they know about Sept. 11. The movie indirectly implies that waterboarding and electrodes to the genitals and all that other stuff that George W. Bushs consiglieri convinced him were kosher actually resulted in actionable intelligence despite the reams of reportage that suggested otherwise. I believe Bigelow and Boals after-the-fact denials that they intended to glorify torture in any way but when you include material like this in a movie that takes such a coolly detached tone in telling its story you cant then be surprised later when some viewers interpret a filmmakers neutral tone as an implicit endorsement. Still even if the eventual raid on the bin Laden compound isnt as exciting as the films first half (this is where some ""Argo""-style suspense might have come in handy) theres a lot to recommend about ""Zero Dark Thirty"" which more often than not reflects Bigelows consummate abilities as an action filmmaker; her no-frills skills in mounting car chases surveillance and the other tools of the CIA trade get a full workout. The acting is also uniformly strong although if you found the parade of famous faces popping up in ""Lincoln"" to be distracting you aint seen nothing yet. Many recognizable performers turn up very briefly for their chance to be in the new Bigelow movie to the occasional point of distraction. (I started counting lines from well-known actors; ""Torchwood"" star John Barrowman? Two.) And even if ""Zero Dark Thirty"" packs something less of a punch than ""The Hurt Locker"" its still a movie thats going to part of the national discussion both politically and artistically and deservedly so. Whether you love it hate it or have mixed feelings its not to be ignored. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

The year is 2003 the place a secret prison (or ""black site"") somewhere in the deserts of the Middle East or Asia the task at hand the interrogation of a detainee with suspected ties to Al Qaeda. The agency man Dan (Jason Clarke) has clearly been at this for a stretch with a full beard Arabic script tattooed along his forearm and a laid-back surfer parlance that belies his skill as a highly trained operative. Perhaps not realizing that waterboarding would be on the first days agenda his new partner Maya (Jessica Chastain) shows up in a smart black pantsuit. ""Theres no shame if you want to watch from the monitor"" he advises though we soon see that Maya has no trouble with getting up close.What takes a while in Zero Dark Thirty is the gathering of useful information from suspects who dont want to divulge it even as ""enhanced"" methods of coercion and humiliation are applied to loosen their tongues. What takes even longer is the fitting of that information into the jigsaw of false leads trap doors and dead ends that was the U.S. governments decade-long manhunt for Osama bin Laden. So Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal (who previously collaborated on the Oscar-winning The Hurt Locker) put that interrogation scene right up front not to shock us or to sound the cry of moral outrage but to let us know what were in for. We might already know how this story begins with the September 11 2001 attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center (here deftly represented by an audio montage of real emergency phone calls played against a darkened screen). We might also know how it ends with the May 1 2011 Navy SEAL raid on the suburban compound in Abbottabad Pakistan where bin Laden had been hiding in something like plain sight. But in Zero Dark Thirty the drama is in the middle distance.Call it torture if you must but Zero Dark Thirty never does which will stoke the ire of the human rights community and puzzle those on the right who regard Hollywood as a bastion of simpering liberalism. People on both sides might find the interrogation scenes difficult to watch which is as it should be. Like most of what we see in the film these are depicted as part of a process a means to an end. As in The Hurt Locker Bigelow and Boal (a former columnist for this paper) come not to judge but to show leaving the rest up to us.Film Details Zero Dark Thirty RatingR GenreAction/Adventure Running Time157 More Info Trailer ""Just so you know its going to take a while."" Time is as much the enemy in Zero Dark Thirty as it was for the elite bomb squad of The Hurt Locker--only there you could see the little red numbers counting down to extinction whereas here the next attack could come at any time and with no advance warning on a crowded London subway or at a seemingly impregnable CIA base in the mountains of Afghanistan. The uncertainty is gripping; the attacks when they do occur never less than startling. Above all Bigelow makes you feel the defeat of those who know they might have prevented them especially Maya always seeming to look through people rather than at them focused on the endgame. Its a sensational performance by Chastain the earth mother in The Tree of Life and the paranoids wife in Take Shelter. Shes a most unlikely leading lady pale and slight of stature with a raging mane of strawberry blond hair but she holds the screen with a feral intensity an obsessives self-possession. Like the human time bomb played by Jeremy Renner in The Hurt Locker Chastains Maya comes to seem like the very personification of her quest. Shes a fanatic hunting a fanatic.If The Hurt Locker embedded us inside the blast radius Zero Dark Thirty offers a different kind of sensory immersion. It drops us into the badly furnished fluorescent-lit offices where dedicated public servants willingly sacrifice ""normal"" lives in the name of something bigger than themselves and struggle against the same petty bureaucrats one encounters in any company--whether the boss is Uncle Sam or merely some guy named Sam. Boal based the script on his own independent reporting and though published accounts verify many of the major details even the smallest touches in Zero Dark Thirty feel authentic enough that we scarcely question them by turns so ordinary (a Christmas tree blinking forlornly in the corner of an Afghan base) or so absurd (valuable intel obtained from a Kuwaiti source in exchange for a Lamborghini) they can only be true.About 25 minutes of screen time pass before we first hear the name of Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti the trusted bin Laden courier who will eventually lead the CIA to their prize catch though at this point victory is still years away. But if progress is slow in Zero Dark Thirty the flow of information is a riptide and the movie doesnt wait for you to catch up. There are more than 100 speaking parts--fellow analysts CIA chiefs national security advisers SEAL team members--many of them played by familiar faces managing to seem unfamiliar entering for a scene or two and just as soon disappearing sometimes before weve had a chance to register their characters names. Sometimes Bigelow and Boal dont even tell us the names because they put enough trust in the audience to assume well have a working knowledge of who the major players are. In other words if you dont know thats former CIA director Leon Panetta (played deliciously by James Gandolfini) this is why God invented Google.When the raid finally comes its almost an anticlimax not because we know bin Laden will be there but because even if we didnt Mayas unshakable faith would by now have us convinced. Still the sequence reconfirms Bigelow as a master of high-tech action from the modified Black Hawk helicopters slicing silently through the Abbottabad skies to the precisely choreographed storming of the compound itself--all of it captured in a mixture of night vision and pellucid HD videography by cameraman Greig Fraser. Bigelow and Boal dont overly heroicize the mission--no literal or figurative flag-waving no panting orchestral score--in part because they take the heroism to be self-evident and in part because they marvel at the smooth professionalism of the SEALs who manage to bag bin Laden swiftly and with a minimum of collateral damage as if it really were just another day at the office. Its only a few scenes later that Zero Dark Thirty reaches its true emotional peak when Maya framed in medium close-up does something we havent seen her do for the past two and a half hours.

"Zero Dark Thirty | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; zero-dark-thirty ) Zero Dark Thirty (United States 2012) December 18 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli Zero Dark Thirty is a compelling contemporary thriller with the added benefit of also being an engrossing character study. Like Argo it interweaves elements of the historical record with fictional embellishments and speculation to create a tapestry depicting the sometimes fatal front-line struggles of intelligence agency operatives. Unlike Argo however it provides a fascinating and powerfully portrayed central character. With all apologies to Ben Affleck Jessica Chastain rivets the attention. The story culled as it has been from recent headlines is not full of surprises or revelations. We all know it how it will end with Osama bin Laden in a body bag. The fascination and suspense comes from seeing how the events leading to that moment are dramatized. Zero Dark Thirty opens on 9/11 (with the fall of the Twin Towers being depicted only in sound as the screen remains dark) and concludes on May 2 2011. In between it follows the efforts of a CIA agent Maya (Jessica Chastain) to locate Osama bin Laden in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region and the mission led by Navy SEAL Patrick (Joel Edgerton) to ""take out"" UBL. The chronicle of events unfolds like a superior spy story with Maya initially being thrust into a situation where shes in over her head. Apprenticed to a veteran interrogator named Dan (Jason Clarke) she witnesses him torture and intimidate a suspected al-Qaeda prisoner. After Dan returns to the United States Maya takes over his role; she becomes tenacious and proves capable of intimidating her boss Special Agent Joseph Bradley (Kyle Chandler). Once her cover is blown and she is forced to return home she continues to push the operation from Langley. Although the last 30 minutes follows the SEALs Maya is never far from the viewers attention. Zero Dark Thirty is as much about the central character as it is about the hunt for bin Laden and the genius of the production directed by Kathryn Bigelow and written by Mark Boal is that it successfully balances these two elements. Maya is not a traditionally ""three-dimensional character."" We know little about her past and nothing about her future. But we understand her fully in the present. Shes Ahab and bin Laden is the whale. She will go to any and all extremes to kill him. Obsession is her defining characteristic; she is fully invested in the hunt to the point where she proves unable to answer two simple questions ""Do you have any friends?"" and ""Where do you want to go now?"" The most suspenseful sequence in Zero Dark Thirty is not the climactic assault on bin Ladens compound. Instead its the depiction of the Camp Chapman attack. This event which occurred on December 30 2009 led news reports that day but Zero Dark Thirty puts it in context. Its a harrowing 15-minute sequence that is among the most tense segments in any 2012 motion picture and recalls Bigelows The Hurt Locker for white-knuckle entertainment. The script uses the governments official account of the hunt and killing for bin Laden as its main template. This is enhanced by off-the-record details provided by sources cultivated by Bigelow and Boal. The strong sense of verisimilitude is not surprising. The filmmakers are circumspect in their identification of characters based on real-life individuals; most have had name changes. Jennifer Lynne Matthews for example is called ""Jessica"" in movie (and is played by Jennifer Ehle). The character portrayed by James Gandolfini is obviously meant to be Leon Panetta but he is never mentioned by name and the credits cite him simply as ""CIA Director."" And Maya is a semi-fictionalized analog for a counterpart. Jessica Chastains performance will at minimum garner an Oscar nomination. Alongside Jennifer Lawrence she is considered a front-runner. Chastain gives us something we too rarely get on-screen a powerful uncompromising female character with the strength and presence to dominate in a traditional male genre the thriller. Chastain makes Maya vital and incomparable. The success of the film relies heavily on this character and the vividness of Maya is determined by the forcefulness of Chastains performance. Zero Dark Thirtys cinematography draws the viewer into the action without resorting to shaky camera work. Yes many of the shots are hand-held but they are stable enough that they dont cause motion sickness and dont reduce the action to murky incoherence. Likewise Alexandre Desplats score is used sparingly. The assault on bin Ladens compound mixes traditional third-person shots with greenish night scope images. The al-Qaeda leaders death is shown but in such a manner that we never get a clear shot of his face. Does the movie ""glorify"" torture as has been reported in some circles? No although the implication is that some useful information may have been gleaned from the ""enhanced interrogation"" of a suspect. Zero Dark Thirty doesnt shy away from depicting ways in which American and pro-American forces questioned those who may have had operational knowledge of al-Qaeda but its a stretch to argue that the movie is presenting a defense of the validity of information gained through these means. In fact the torture scenes (which are about as graphic as one could envision for an R-rated motion picture) are designed more to illustrate aspects of Mayas character than they are to advance the narrative. Zero Dark Thirty is unquestionably one of the best films of 2012. Even though it recounts events covered exhaustively in the news and by documentaries in portraying things from Mayas perspective we are given a fresh vantage point that makes everything seem more immediate. The running time is slightly over 2 1/2 hours but the movie passes in the twinkling of an eye proving that sometimes a seemingly inflated length is necessary to tell the story. Bigelow has turned in her second consecutive piece of expert filmmaking.

Share Tweet Before Zero Dark Thirty had so much as a title--and even once it was made but before many had seen it--both sides of the political spectrum ignited with speculation over how The Hurt Locker director Kathryn Bigelow and writer Mark Boal would frame the hunt for Osama bin Laden. On the right some were concerned that its original release date before the 2012 presidential election would boost President Obama blowing up like a Hurt Locker IED in the face of anyone who questioned his foreign-policy credentials. And in the weeks leading up to opening day the left has gone full Drudge Siren--or the lefty equivalent of Drudge Siren anyway--over reports that the film depicts torture as an essential in finding bin Laden thus justifying a morally repellent tactic. Both cases testify to the potency of popular entertainment in general and a bin Laden movie in particular Zero Dark Thirty stands to become the dominant narrative about this important historical event no matter its distortions composites or other slippery feints of storytelling. In that it wields a dangerous power. So how can a movie about the bin Laden killing thread such a thin needle? The answer is It cant. And it hasnt based on some reactions pegging it as a torture apologia a CIA hagiography or a little of both columns. Others have pointed out that in the film not a single useful piece of information is gleaned from torture and its more concerned with the reality of torture than its efficacy. The latter case is far more convincing but the fact that two people can watch the same movie and come to opposite conclusions speaks well of Bigelow and Boals thrilling procedural which has a journalistic quality that still allows for some nuance and ambiguity where the fog of war can cloud up the scene. Its impossible for a film like Zero Dark Thirty to be entirely apolitical--and presenting it as a piece of just-the-facts reportage makes it if anything more suspicious--but the Rorschach blot Bigelow and Boal have made out of this loaded story speaks well of their methods. A rough triangulation of opinion columns puts them right on the money. Zero Dark Thirty opens with a blank screen and a recording of a real 911 call on September 11 2001 from a frantic woman trapped in one of the Twin Towers. Though it feels exploitative to goose the audiences emotions with the cries of the doomed Bigelow want to charge the film with a specific kind of energy--a sense that getting the man responsible for 9/11 is imperative not just as an act of justice but as an act of revenge. So when she cuts immediately to two years later when CIA officers are waterboarding a detainee at some Pakistani black site its not what the torture yields thats ultimately important but the suggestion that the lust for revenge led the country to a very dark place. The film permanently resides in these shadows and the ultimate dispatching of bin Laden offers nary a sliver of light. The torture scenes are only a small part of Zero Dark Thirty but they set the stakes for the films hero played fiercely by Jessica Chastain who reacts to her first day on the job with revulsion over her colleagues brutal techniques and a resolve to keep moving forward. The bulk of the film details Chastains relentless decade-long search for bin Laden as it bumps up against cold trails and dead ends with only fitful support from the CIA and other bureaucrats who dismiss him as marginalized (or dead) and seek targets elsewhere. Any progress owes more to the patient detective work of surveillance and information-gathering than ""enhanced interrogation"" and it eventually brings Chastain and her team to the trusted courier who will lead them to bin Ladens compound in Abbottabad Pakistan. With Chastains single-minded obsession as the through-line Zero Dark Thirty takes the reliable form of procedurals like All The Presidents Men and Zodiac staying doggedly on the investigative path while keeping the political and cultural aspects of the case at arms length. Its about a professional doing her job with integrity and grit and it would be extraordinarily absorbing if Chastain were merely hunting down the worlds most delicious omelet much less bin Laden. As with The Hurt Locker Bigelow and Boal approach people doing dangerous jobs with a respect that veers uncomfortably close to reverence but theyre meticulous process-oriented filmmakers and their quest for verity isnt just a pose. They offer up a document for fact-checkers. Zero Dark Thirty escalates mercilessly in tension as the net tightens ending with the raid on Abbottabad a sequence so masterfully staged that it sets off a chill of recognition. But the tone here is no different than the tone of the torture scenes toward the beginning of the film Getting bin Laden isnt the cathartic triumph at the end of a hard road but an absolute horrorshow treated without the faintest squeak of rah-rah triumphalism. The one piece of affirmative dialogue (""Geronimo"") arrives as matter-of-factly as ""Lets roll"" in Paul Greengrass excellent United 93 blessedly free of any impulse to underline heroic action. Theres no question Zero Dark Thirty honors the competence and sacrifice of people involved in this operation but within responsible limits i.e. without Maverick and Iceman trading bear hugs on the aircraft carrier. The final shot confirms it Zero Dark Thirty isnt meant as a stirring tribute to the men and women responsible for taking down bin Laden though their bravery and persistence is duly respected. Its a film about revenge and its immense costs different from a common vigilante story because of the target not the arc. The events of 9/11 call for a response but from the torture scenes in the beginning to the raid on Abbottabad a decade later Zero Dark Thirty takes the audience down a grim terrifying path that isnt relieved by the death of the elusive man who killed 3000 Americans. Some demons cannot be exorcised. For thoughts on and a place to discuss plot details not talked about in this review visit Zero Dark Thirtys Spoiler Space.

Zero Dark Thirty By Peter Travers December 18 2012 More News Sundance 2015 Stars Answer Peter Travers Burning Question 10 Best Movies of 2014 All Stories >> Hang on tight. The knockout punch of the movie season is being delivered by Zero Dark Thirty. Youre in for a hell of a ride with this high-voltage thriller that digs with shocking gravity into the decade-long hunt for Osama bin Laden. Director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal top their Oscar-winning work in The Hurt Locker by exposing the raw feelings still simmering after 9/11. More News Sundance 2015 Stars Answer Peter Travers Burning Question 10 Best Movies of 2014 All Stories >> The film opens with voices in the towers crying for help. It ends on May 2nd 2011 when Navy SEAL Team Six took out the Al Qaeda leader at his compound in Abbottabad Pakistan at zero dark thirty (thats half past midnight). But the killing is only part of the story. Bigelow and Boal go beyond the SEAL heroics examined in Mark Owens bestselling memoir No Easy Day plunging into the byzantine layers of the CIA where operatives - low-and high-echelon trackers and torturers - spend years at the chase. We see the toll reflected on the face of Maya (Jessica Chastain) a CIA targeter (based on a real agent still undercover) who hasnt yet grown calluses over the places where she can still feel. Chastain is a marvel. She plays Maya like a gathering storm in an indelible implosive performance that cuts so deep we can feel her nerve endings. Hollywood formula is out. No love story. No flag-waving. No politics. Just a look at people on a job where action defines character. Bigelow is a virtuoso at building suspense without compromising truth. Her talent is off the charts. And Boal a journalist with an unerring ear for the tensions vibrating under CIA- and military-speak goes beyond research to find the human side of history. Victories are limited and costly in the war against terrorism. Zero Dark Thirty knows that in its bones. A harrowing early scene in which a CIA enforcer Dan (a terrific Jason Clarke) waterboards a suspect Ammar (Reda Kateb) stands in marked contrast to Obama on TV claiming America wont tolerate torture. Maya cringes when Dan yanks Ammar around with a dog collar. But she doesnt fade. After years of strategic but mind-numbing work to track bin Ladens hiding place she shows her steel when CIA boss Leon Panetta (a tart tough James Gandolfini) asks who ""the girl"" is ""Im the motherfucker that found this place sir."" Her anger and agony hit a peak when she loses a colleague (a very fine Jennifer Ehle) to a suicide bomber ""Im gonna smoke everybody involved in this op and then Im gonna kill bin Laden."" Of course that job is left to the SEALs two of whom played by Joel Edgerton and Chris Pratt taste Mayas scorn for their stud posturing and ""gear bullshit."" In an electrifying climax enhanced by Greig Frasers outstanding hand-held camerawork Bigelow tracks the stealth helicopters as they raid bin Ladens compound. We watch the action as the SEALs do through the greenish haze of night-vision glasses. Though we know the outcome the suspense is nerve-shattering. Maya identifies the body giving ""the girl"" the last word. Bigelow clearly relates to the woman warrior at the center of her film. Her stellar teamwork with Chastain is beautifully distilled near the end as Maya heads home in an empty cargo plane. In a close-up which Chastain holds with haunting pain and subtlety she mirrors Mayas moral confusion over just what her mission has accomplished if anything in the War on Terror.

Photo Credit Columbia Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The hunt for Osama bin Laden from the offices of the CIA to the Navy SEAL raid. BOTTOM LINE You may not like Kathryn Bigelows version of events but this gripping documentary-style thriller is a movie that needs to be seen. CAST Jessica Chastain Jason Clarke Mark Strong LENGTH 237 To torture or not to torture? Despite what critics and pundits are saying that is actually not the question being asked by ""Zero Dark Thirty"" Kathryn Bigelows no-holds-barred re-creation of the hunt for Osama bin Laden. It arrives in theaters Wednesday already accused -- frequently by the left -- of justifying torture by showing that it yielded results. Thats a shallow reading though of a movie thats asking much deeper questions. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" like Bigelows Oscar-winning ""The Hurt Locker"" is written by journalist Mark Boal from whats being called ""firsthand accounts."" It mixes checkable facts with dramatic license but ""Zero Dark Thirty"" has no overweening political agenda. Instead it unfolds with the cool detachment of a documentary even in its most tense and gripping scenes.

Our heroine is CIA agent Maya a burr-in-the-saddle type supposedly based on a real person and played with fiery focus by Jessica Chastain. In the years after 9/11 as Americas horror fades presidents come and go regimes change and even the CIAs top waterboarder (a very good Jason Clarke) takes a desk job. But Maya remains reminding the agencys nervous nellies (Mark Strong Kyle Chandler and others) that Public Enemy No. 1 is still alive. ""Im gonna smoke everybody in this op"" she says without a shred of bravado ""and then Im gonna kill bin Laden."" The final raid on the Abbottabad compound is a heart-pounder but ""Zero Dark Thirty"" may go down in history for its excruciating opening sequence of a soiled detainee (Reda Kateb) being humiliated stripped and waterboarded. The question isnt whether it worked. The question is how we as Americans feel about it and ""Zero Dark Thirty"" leaves the answer up to you.

Zero Dark Thirty Kathryn Bigelows meticulous and electrifying re-creation of the hunt for Osama bin Laden is that kind of movie. Early on a Saudi Arabian terror suspect imprisoned at an undisclosed CIA ""black site"" is stripped starved and waterboarded. For the audience its a deeply unsettling spectacle but also a darkly fascinating one since Dan (Jason Clarke) the bearded thoughtful-looking agency veteran whos doling out the abuse is anything but a sadist. ""When you lie to me"" he says ""I hurt you"" and this mantra repeated with terse resolve lets us know that hes doing whatever it takes to extract information. As Maya (Jessica Chastain) a young CIA analyst looks on with a mixture of horror and stony approval Dan plays both bad cop and (as he offers food and relief from torture) good cop. The suspect finally gives up a name Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti whom he claims works as a courier for bin Laden. Part of the power of Zero Dark Thirty is that it looks with disturbing clarity at the ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" that were used after 9/11 and it says in no uncertain terms They worked. This is a bin Laden thriller that Dick Cheney and Barack Obama could love. At the same time the film spins its fearless -- and potentially controversial -- stance toward the issue of how the U.S. treats its prisoners into a heady international detective thriller. Desperate for a link to bin Laden Maya zeroes in on the name of the courier and it becomes her obsession. Zero Dark Thirty immerses us brilliantly in her intellectual processes as she attempts to find out where on earth this man could be. Gravely alert Jessica Chastain acts with a hushed ferocity that turns her every reaction into a form of action. She plays Maya as a dogged soldier of the information age whose youth and inexperience are really assets since she isnt trapped in old ways of seeing. She knows when shes confronting outdated Cold War logic. The trouble is her golden lead keeps going cold (at one point shes told that the courier is dead) and as the years tick forward her boss (Kyle Chandler) -- a testy functionary of the Bush era -- ups the pressure to ""protect the homeland."" He wants captives he can show off to his superiors not the increasingly elusive bin Laden. But Maya digs in navigating a treacherous puzzle of duplicitous suspects coded names and suicide bombers who know how to worm their way into a U.S. safety zone. Some of her strategy is almost funny as when she gets Dan back in the States to hit up the agency for 200 grand -- all to buy a Lamborghini for a stooge in Kuwait wholl provide a key phone number. When Maya finally locates the person she believes is the courier theres a long sequence set in the packed downtown streets of Peshawar Pakistan in which a team of agents tries to get near his cell phone and Bigelow directs it with such visually supple real-time suspense that she just about controls your heartbeat. When the link to bin Laden is established and we see that iconic three-tiered concrete lair its cathartic. Bigelow stages the deadly raid on the compound for maximum realism which gives the film a classic thriller climax that is also in its shockingly low-key way almost an anti-thriller climax. The Navy SEALs blow open the doors then inch floor by floor through the darkness where they strafe Osamas assistants and wives -- and its all staged with a calm that mirrors the no-sweat strictly-business demeanor of the SEALs themselves. (Its no spoiler to say that they get bin Laden though it would be to say what the killing looks like.) Theyre soldiers doing their jobs and with awesome bravery but Zero Dark Thirty is really a gripping salute to the desk warrior who spent not minutes but years going in for the kill.

By David Denby Kathryn Bigelows movie chronicles a long trail of frustration leading to fragmentary gains and at last to success in Abbottabad.   Credit Illustration by Concepcion Studios In ""Zero Dark Thirty"" the masterly new movie directed by Kathryn Bigelow and written by Mark Boal a C.I.A. field agent has an Al Qaeda operative in his grip. The agent whose name is Dan (Jason Clarke) a tall handsome guy with a bushy brown beard subjects the prisoner to ""enhanced interrogation""--a full complement of pain naked humiliation and waterboarding. ""This is what defeat looks like"" Dan tells the operative who is named Ammar (and is played with sympathy by the French actor Reda Kateb). These words are spoken at a C.I.A. ""black site"" in Pakistan in 2003. But most of the movie is about American defeat--the failure to capture or kill Osama bin Laden as Al Qaeda pulls off attacks in Saudi Arabia Britain and Pakistan. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" chronicles a long trail of frustration leading to fragmentary gains and at last to success on the night of May 1 2011 Operation Neptunes Spear a Navy SEALs siege of bin Ladens hideout in Abbottabad which is so perfectly executed that it almost defies normal skepticism about the way life works. The virtue of ""Zero Dark Thirty"" however is that it pays close attention to the way life does work; it combines ruthlessness and humanity in a manner that is paradoxical and disconcerting yet satisfying as art. Ammar may be working for Al Qaeda but hes also a human being and hes suffering. Yet in attempting to show in a mainstream movie the reprehensibility of torture and what was done in our name the filmmakers seem to have conflated events and in this they have generated a sore controversy the chairs of two Senate committees have said that the information used to find bin Laden was not uncovered through waterboarding. Do such scenes hurt the movie? Not as art; they are expertly done without flinching from the horror of the acts and without exploitation. But they damage the movie as an alleged authentic account. Bigelow and Boal--the team behind ""The Hurt Locker""--want to claim the authority of fact and the freedom of fiction at the same time and the contradiction mars an ambitious project. The movie begins at the primal moment the screen is black as we hear the frightened voices of people trapped in the World Trade Center on 9/11. That misery and abjection is what the hunt is all about. The C.I.A. unit charged with finding bin Laden isnt just trying to prevent further attacks; its openly seeking revenge. Boal who began his career as a reporter for Playboy and Rolling Stone interviewed some of the principals involved. What we see--the anger and the desperation; the terse anxious exchanges among agents; the breathless chase through crowded Pakistani streets--is stunningly detailed and convincing from scene to scene. It also moves with juggernaut speed. Even the pauses the silences the instances of reflection push the narrative along. In this movie thinking is action. There is someone else at that interrogation session an observer who wears a black hood and removes it to shake out a glorious curtain of reddish-gold hair. This is Maya (Jessica Chastain) who becomes the key C.I.A. investigator into bin Ladens whereabouts. Maya based on a real agent whom Bigelow and Boal have elevated out of agency anonymity is an obsessed woman with no personal life or interests. But Bigelow chose an appealing actress to play her Chastain has a slightly distraught look a sudden smile a warm-spirited responsiveness. Maya winces at American cruelties and grieves over the death of colleagues in failed operations. Unlike Claire Daness troubled bipolar Carrie in the TV series ""Homeland"" Maya is as sane as daylight but nevertheless single-minded about killing bin Laden. Dan exhausted by his duties returns to Washington but Maya stays in the field along with the Islamabad station chief (Kyle Chandler) whos a Bush Administration functionary; an ambitious operative (Jennifer Ehle); and a surveillance specialist (the impressively sombre Edgar Ramirez). Mayas theory is that bin Laden cant communicate with his network by cell phone or Internet so he must be relying on a courier. The movie turns into the ultimate procedural in which computer work matching photographs and one seeming irrelevancy after another in an old interrogation video lead Maya to a man known as Abu Ahmed who at regular intervals drives a white S.U.V. from Peshawar to a house in Abbottabad. Mayas investigation has been going on for years but as shaped by Bigelow and Boal the hunt feels like one continuous surge of energy colored by anguish and fury. At first no one takes Maya seriously. But her demands on the agencys resources become increasingly insistent culminating in an enraged moment in which--as Chastains neck engorged swells mightily--she threatens the C.I.A. station head with exposure for incompetence if he doesnt give her what she needs. That a woman is leading the charge is almost as surprising to the Americans as it is to the Muslim prisoners. After all the female avengers of the past fifteen years--Uma Thurman and Angelina Jolie kicking men in the ego and other places--American movies have at last produced a woman clothed like Athena in willful strength and intellectual armor. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a puzzle that keeps changing and re-forming; were held by fleeting references by the workings of Mayas calculations. Bigelow and the cinematographer Greig Fraser make fluid but firm use of a handheld camera without excessive agitation so that you feel pitched into the middle of things but also see clearly what you need to see. A sequence in which a Jordanian who may provide access to bin Laden approaches an American military installation is drawn out to a level of almost unendurable suspense. Two unexpected bomb explosions throw you back in your seat; they have a ferocious power that makes most movie explosions feel like a mere perturbation of digits. The raid begins with beautiful shots of Black Hawk helicopters taking off at night silhouetted against a few brilliant lights. The journey across the mountains from the base in Afghanistan to western Pakistan is conducted in darkness and quiet like a sacred ritual. The SEALs are older and beefier than you expect--big men in their late thirties who nonetheless move smoothly as if their legs were on finely calibrated springs. Bigelow and Fraser shot the sequence twice accumulating forty hours of footage that was edited down to twenty-five minutes of sepulchral green-tinted action--what you see through night-vision goggles. The raid is a methodical room-by-room exercise in deadly aggression that is without parallel as a display of force in recent movies. Bigelow presents bin Ladens corpse and Mayas emotions after the kill with considerable circumspection. An example of radical realism this movie has its mysteries as well as its devastating certainties. ""I was forty and then I blinked and there I was gonna be ninety"" an old woman says to Debbie (Leslie Mann) who is herself just turning forty. Such is the murmuring subtext of ""This Is 40"" Judd Apatows very funny new comedy times winged chariot is hurrying near. Debbie and her husband Pete (Paul Rudd) a Los Angeles couple with two daughters are hitting early middle age and Apatow has arranged their discontents (with themselves with each other with their parents) into a generous and vibrant series of confrontations and fights all garnished with wisecracks of startling pungency. Debbie and Pete are both exercise freaks but shes a secret smoker and hes a not-so-secret cupcake eater and each indulgence is treated as a taste of mortality. In Los Angeles time has a particular poignancy since the body can never be young enough to satisfy an unsustainable ideal. Debbie owns a boutique and she wonders at the firmness of the breasts of a young employee--a salesgirl played by Megan Fox no less--even squeezing them to make sure that theyre real. They are. Then Fox says ""By the time Im forty these are going to go National Geographic on me."" Were back in Apatow country familiar from ""Knocked Up"" and ""Funny People."" (Debbie and Pete are the other couple from ""Knocked Up"" and Leslie Mann who was in both movies is married to Apatow.) There is the bourgeois household with its chaise longue in the bathroom its iPads its BMW and its Lexus its sunshine always outside the window. Here is all the plenitude and warmth and the triviality and sadness of Los Angeles life. In this case the gleeful abundance is suffering some temporary troubles Pete is an independent record producer devoted to an aging--and low-selling--rock musician Graham Parker (who appears as himself) while at Debbies boutique someone is stealing money from the till. At home Debbie and Pete are running out of both cash and libido and have begun tearing each other apart. Manns happy-face buoyancy fades in an instant into resentment and malice--the switch to a mean tongue is her favorite comic device. Paul Rudd has a handsome jaw and a great smile. Pete at forty is still a boy--moody selfish and dishonest. Rudd has been playing one version or another of this character for years and he has some of his giddiest moments ever as Pete drives his daughters to school while belting out songs that his wife hates and eating forbidden cheeseburgers. For Apatow one guesses the only things that can forestall death are comedy (the movie is full of superb comics including Albert Brooks and Melissa McCarthy) and the flourishing of his children Maude and Iris who appear in the movie as Debbie and Petes daughters performing with all the sweetness and anger that any children might feel around their parents coupled in this case with near-professional aplomb.

By Peter Rainer Film critic December 14 2012 Save for later Saved Jessica Chastain stars in Zero Dark Thirty. Jonathan Olley/Columbia Pictures Industries Inc./AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Kathryn Bigelows troubling infuriating ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is about Maya (Jessica Chastain) a CIA agent whose obsessive single-mindedness eventually lands Osama bin Laden in a body bag. Like Ahab she is fixated on her prey to the exclusion of all else. Bigelow and her screenwriter Mark Boal who also collaborated on ""The Hurt Locker"" deny Maya virtually any back story. We know almost nothing about her life away from the films decade-long hunt. She is a cipher - a vengeance machine with flame-red hair.Bigelow began this project when bin Laden was still on the run but changed course when he was tracked down and killed by Navy SEALs on May 2 2011 in the assault on his compound in Abbottabad Pakistan. As in ""The Hurt Locker"" which was about an American bomb disposal unit in Iraq Bigelow doesnt expend a lot of energy putting the commotion into a political context. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is essentially or at least ostensibly an action thriller. But since we already know the outcome of the SEAL operation which occupies the final half-hour of this more than 2-1/2-hour movie the films narrative has a methodical sameness. This is a nuts-and-bolts cinematic dossier on how the job was done.What I find troubling and infuriating is that by turning the hunt for bin Laden however expertly into a glorified police procedural Bigelow neutralizes the most controversial and charged aspects of this story. (To no avail I might add The film is controversial anyway.) President George W. Bush is never shown ditto Dick Cheney Iraq is AWOL and President Obama is only glimpsed in a 2008 campaign interview. This is a bit like making a movie about the D-Day invasion without referencing FDR or Eisenhower. Recommended Golden Globe Awards The 2012 nominees Actually its much worse since the film traffics in scenes of torture. Its first full sequence in fact has a CIA officer Dan (Jason Clarke) brutally interrogating a man (Reda Kateb) suspected of having information about bin Ladens courier while Maya new to all this observes in hushed compliance. The waterboarding and pummeling and all the rest is presented as crucial to bin Ladens eventual capture. Mission accomplished sort of. Golden Globe Awards The 2012 nominees Video Zero Dark Thirty movie trailer Monitor Movie Guide In a recent New Yorker piece on Bigelow and the film the political reporter Dexter Filkins wrote ""According to several official sources including Dianne Feinstein the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee the identity of bin Ladens courier whose trail led the C.I.A. to the hideout in Pakistan was not discovered through waterboarding. Its a movie not a documentary Boal said. Were trying to make the point that waterboarding and other harsh tactics were part of the C.I.A. program. ""In the Filkins article Bigelow adds ""[T]he film doesnt have an agenda and it doesnt judge. I wanted a boots-on-the-ground experience."" But by not enlarging or contextualizing the meaning of the waterboarding scenes by avoiding any sense of political partisanship Bigelow is in effect judging. Its difficult to look at these sequences in a vacuum which is how she wants us to respond to them. I am not arguing that she should have denounced waterboarding per se. Lets say for the sake of argument that these brutalities helped bring down bin Laden. This is a possibility that antitorture advocates on both sides of the aisle if they are honest with themselves must acknowledge. The problem I have with ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is that for the sake of a ""boots-on-the-ground"" experience it mucks around in matters of great gravity without ever really getting its hands dirty. (Imagine what Costa-Gavras who made ""Z"" or Gillo Pontecorvo who made ""The Battle of Algiers"" would have done with this story.)Dan the almost sadistically enthusiastic interrogator is portrayed as basically one of the guys. Maya who is admiringly called a ""killer"" by her colleagues has so little emotional resonance that she might as well be a cyborg. (She is based on a real person.) Bigelow turns her into an existential hero by the end a lost soul whose life has no meaning once bin Laden is taken out. This is a fancy way of disguising the fact that Maya is a blank. (Is Bigelow saying that in the ""war on terror"" only the blanks can get the job done?)By showing scenes of torture without taking any kind of moral (as opposed to tactical) stand on what we are seeing Bigelow has made an amoral movie - which is I would argue an unconscionable approach to this material. I dont understand those critics and commentators who denounce this films amorality and then go on to laud the movie anyway - as if a films moral stance or lack of the same was incidental to its achievement. Are we so cowed and wowed by cinematic technique that we can afford to lobotomize ourselves in this way? Grade C+ (Rated R for strong violence including brutal disturbing images and for language.)

Killing of un-armed people and shooting killing unarmed women left to ""bleed out"". Dont see this movie. In America we know EVERYONE deserves a trial and we dont kill unarmed people and we dont to violence against women. Alexsaid on Friday December 28 2012 13540 PMIm with Glenn Greenwald on this one by declaring her film a work of journalism Bigelow has an obligation to report the facts rather than insinuating that torture aided in the assassination of OBL. I dont buy it. As someone who tends to agree with the Tomatometer at least 90% of the time I cant condone this nor can I condone ""The Hurt Locker"" ""United 93"" or other such propaganda films that attempt to paint themselves as nothing but the truth.

But its important to recognize that the people who think it does are responding to the moral ambiguity of the movie which pervades not just the question of torture as an instrument of American policy but its entire portrayal of the CIAs obsessive and insanely expensive hunt for Osama bin Laden. Heres the sense in which theyre not wrong What ""Zero Dark Thirty"" has to say about torture and many other things is not entirely clear and what you see in it depends on what you bring with you. That moral ambiguity will drive some viewers nuts but in my view it is also the quality that makes ""Zero Dark Thirty"" something close to a masterpiece.Bigelow and Boal show us ""what happened"" in the secret history of spycraft that led from Sept. 11 2001 to the bin Laden raid on May 1 2011 - meaning their selective interpretation and dramatization of what happened to be sure - without offering any explicit commentary or steering us toward a clear moral verdict. In our fractious political climate that makes people jumpy and anxious and often overeager to proclaim that such a work can have a dangerous effect on weaker-minded viewers (but presumably not themselves). Indeed one can argue that the mode of studied objectivity in both ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and the previous Boal-Bigelow film the Oscar-winning ""Hurt Locker"" is both a philosophical stance and a narrative tactic calculated to fuel debate and controversy. I am not proposing by the way that Boal and Bigelow are actually ""neutral"" and have no politics or no opinions since I dont believe thats likely or even possible. Its just that those things are not written Oliver Stone-style on the surface of the work.Despite all the recent headlines and largely uninformed controversy only a small portion of ""Zero Dark Thirty"" concerns the black-site interrogations where torture was used. That looms large in discussions of the film partly because Bigelow throws us and the driven young CIA redhead named Maya (Jessica Chastain) who will be the protagonist into the deep end right away. After a haunting prologue in which we hear audiotapes from the collapsing World Trade Center over a black screen the first thing we actually see is Mayas arrival at a secret Pakistani facility where an interrogator named Dan (Jason Clarke) from the CIAs ""Saudi group"" (i.e. the al-Qaida specialists) is working over an Arab detainee named Ammar (Reda Kateb) who may have been a mid-level al-Qaida moneyman.Ammar gets pretty close to the full monty He is beaten sexually humiliated deprived of sleep locked in a tiny cabinet subjected to hours of heavy metal cranked to 11 and when they really want to break him repeatedly waterboarded (albeit without a board). Its dreadful to watch even in dramatic form and it poses the films central moral challenge right at the outset One atrocity (meaning the 9/11 attacks) has provoked another. We have taken Dick Cheneys famous taxi ride to the dark side in search of justice or vengeance or whatever payback term you like. How has that worked out for us? What are the consequences of embracing not just the enemys tactics but the enemys essentially nihilistic worldview in which the standards of universal morality that supposedly formed the basis of the Western worlds liberal revolutions simply do not matter?Bigelow and Boal did not invent this problem out of nothing people and its not limited to the 9/11 era or the United States of America. Every single powerful nation throughout history whether Western and supposedly enlightened or not has used torture and brutality and state terror as instruments of policy pretty much whenever it convinced itself it needed to. What has changed since say the end of the 18th century is that the great powers are now compelled to pay lip service to higher ideals and pretend that they never do such things or to explain them away as aberrations perpetrated by rogue elements. When all else fails theres always the appeal to patriotism still the last refuge of scoundrels as it was to Samuel Johnson. We had to break the rules to ""protect the homeland"" as characters repeatedly say in ""Zero Dark Thirty"" which was approximately the rhetoric used to justify British torture in Northern Ireland French torture in Algeria American torture in Latin America and the Philippines and on and on. Not an uplifting perspective on the topic I know.Back to the movie Whether Ammar offers up any useful new information pointing toward Osama bin Laden and what exactly Dan gets out of him through torture are deliberately murky plot points. Some commentators have made it sound as though ""Zero Dark Thirty"" offers a clear cause-and-effect relationship like an outtake episode of Foxs odious ""24"" They torture the hell out of some guy he gives up Osama the Navy SEALs bring death from above to that now legendary compound in Abbottabad and its rah-rah USA But the story this movie spins isnt anything like that and were a long way from idiotic ticking-bomb scenarios.At most Boals screenplay suggests that one detail emerged from this interrogation that would become important a long way down the line - but that it was actually information the CIA already possessed from other sources. Even that vague connection is contentious since virtually everything about this story is. I suspect Boals intention is more like this Torture was absolutely employed by CIA interrogators on presumed al-Qaida detainees and the people who practiced it apparently believed it was working. Therefore its an important part of the story whether or not it really produced ""actionable intel."" ""Zero Dark Thirty"" absolutely does not imply that torture interrogations led directly to the shadowy bin Laden contact who in turn led the CIA to ""the Sheiks"" Pakistani hiding place. Its just as plausible to say that ""Zero Dark Thirty"" suggests that torture became a grotesque and unproductive sideshow that gummed up the works and slowed down the more normal forms of surveillance coercion and subterfuge that constitute intelligence-gathering. You Might Also Like What I havent said until now is that ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a sweeping and magnificent work of cinematic craft by far the best film of Bigelows career. Im not suggesting that the moral and ethical deconstruction doesnt matter but the movie is much bigger than that and while youre watching it youll be too swept up in the moody absorbing doom-haunted narrative to focus on the picayune details. Although Chastains Maya remains at or near the center throughout - an intense obsessive-compulsive woman with no known boyfriend or family or hometown -- this is a kaleidoscopic voyage with many strands and many characters which moves from remote Afghan military bases to a hotel bombing in Islamabad to a freighter docked in Poland to the corridors of CIA headquarters in Virginia to a luxury car dealership in Kuwait City. (Standouts in the large cast include Jennifer Ehle as a more senior CIA woman Mark Duplass as a surveillance technician Joel Edgerton as the SEAL squadron leader and James Gandolfini as then-CIA head Leon Panetta almost the only character with a known public identity.)This movie reminds me more than anything else of Olivier Assayas tremendous miniseries ""Carlos"" which is also a semi-journalistic epic of recent history with many interlocking real-life pieces as well as a story about a worldwide manhunt. (The presence of Edgar Ramirez who played the eponymous terrorist for Assayas in a supporting role here as a military-intelligence tough guy feels like an explicit nod.) Its not surprising but at least a little ironic that ""Carlos"" too was attacked for withholding moral judgment but from the other side. I remember numerous angry comments from readers who clearly hadnt seen it most of them presuming that if a French director had made a film about a famous 70s terrorist it must be a radical-chic hagiography.In this case - well in both ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and ""Carlos"" actually - the moral dimension is woven into the story all the way along and whether you want to respond to the film as a jingoistic celebration or an indictment of Americas role in the world is up to you. I would argue that along this journey and right up to its endpoint Bigelow and Boal compel us to engage a series of difficult questions about the tactics strategy morality and larger meaning of both the search for bin Laden and the overall American response to 9/11. Certainly the issue of the CIAs ""enhanced interrogation"" techniques under the Bush administration in violation of both international law and basic standards of human decency is central to that discussion. But so in fact is the Osama raid itself (which arguably got Barack Obama reelected). Bigelow cinematographer Greig Fraser and the production design team of Jeremy Hindle stage the Abbottabad raid in the last half-hour or so of the film as a supremely tense and exciting mini-masterwork of action cinema. I have no doubt that many or most American audience members will respond with enthusiasm cheering and so on. Whether thats really the appropriate response is another matter; Ive heard audience members cheering the killings in ""Dirty Harry"" or ""The Godfather"" or ""Unforgiven"" too. As Open Salon blogger and critic Scott Mendelson pointed out in a pair of recent tweets if the commentary-free depiction of torture in ""Zero Dark Thirty"" introduces a degree of moral instability so too does the depiction of American troops staging a night raid on a private home in a sovereign nation with which were not at war and shooting a bunch of apparent civilians who put up little or no resistance.But as Ive made clear by now I believe that engaging with ""Zero Dark Thirty"" on narrow quasi-legalistic grounds - asking whether it depicts torture as ""useful"" and then debating whether such a depiction amounts to an endorsement - is missing the forest for the trees. (Does Shakespeares ""Julius Caesar"" endorse political assassination? Its a tactic thats known to ""work"" and the conspirators had generally good intentions.) Whether or not they ever expressed it in these terms Bigelow and Boal have tried to measure the hidden moral dimensions of an existential crisis that has eaten away at the American soul and at the larger transatlantic liberal consensus that has governed the world since the Cold War. I would suggest that while Islamic fundamentalism is a dangerous force in many places in the world the real enemy in this crisis is our own fear along with our paranoid quasi-religious sense of our mission in the world. Look at Frasers last shots of Maya alone and uncertain at the end of ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and then come back and tell me this movie is hyper-patriotic torture porn.Every viewer will react to this films conundrums in his or her own way It is not merely possible but certain that people who do want to apologize for torture will conclude that the film supports their view. I believe those people are wrong but then I believe theyre wrong about lots of other things too. Were coming to the movie from different places and will leave that way too. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" holds a dark mirror before us; if what we see when we stare into it looks distorted and monstrous it should also look familiar.""Zero Dark Thirty"" opens Dec. 19 in limited release with wider national release to follow in January.

An instantly essential thriller Zero Dark Thirty begins with a CIA interrogation in progress then focuses more intently on the pallid young woman watching and allowing it to happen. Maya (The Helps Jessica Chastain exploring a new register of haunted drive) will become our surrogate. An agent drafted out of high school (the character is based on an actual person) she knows the hunt for ""UBL"" and nothing else. Shell be coarsened by illegal tactics that may produce vital intel (an honest movie needs to go there and this one does boldly) shell see her colleagues tire and fail and roughly a decade later Maya will still be running down the globes most wanted terrorist. As major as Kathryn Bigelows The Hurt Locker felt its hard to appreciate the leap she takes here launching her actors into scorched obsessed territory last roamed by David Finchers Zodiac.

Bigelows aim is not to tell us what to think; she even refuses to tell us outright what she thinks. At first Jessica Chastains Maya a junior CIA agent whos just learning the ropes of interrogation flinches as she watches an eerily delicate form of brutality being inflicted upon a prisoner. Later Maya takes a hand in the captives torture herself seemingly without the flicker of an eyelid. Is this evidence of Bigelows revulsion at the methods the United States government used to smoke out Osama Bin Laden or of her moral disengagement from the whole issue? That question is up for interpretation until the end of ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and beyond. Because ""Zero Dark Thirty"" isnt a brief the multiplexs equivalent of a white paper a thing we can sum up in a two-minute takeaway. (Though that hasnt stopped people from trying in some cases even before theyve seen the movie as columnists Glenn Greenwald and Andrew Sullivan have done.) Instead its a stunning confident tensile piece of work held together by doubt rather than moral certainty - as if Bigelow and her screenwriter Mark Boal were operating from the idea that doubt is dynamic while moral certainty is just another kind of stasis. Chastains Maya is the steely soul of ""Zero Dark Thirty"" a footsoldier so driven to locate the mastermind behind 9/11 that her mania defines her very core. She would be the ultimate government lackey dutiful to the point of zealotry except shes her own harshest judge Serving her country may be hard enough; pleasing herself is harder. She delivers the movies most rousing catch phrase - its only catch phrase; youll know it when you hear it - in a scene where a group of blowhard male Langley types led by James Gandolfini as a stand-in for Leon Panetta assume credit for her work as if she werent even in the room. Maya has a friendly-prickly competitive relationship with her female coworkers -- as personified by a fellow agent played by Jennifer Ehle with her customary ironclad coolness - and barely even entertains the notion of flirting with the guys even when shes stuck in remote desert outposts with them for days on end. The prime candidate for that kind of monkey business would be Jason Clarkes Dan the senior agent who shows her the ropes of interrogation but their relationship is strictly professional. Dan in fact is burning out on the job just as Maya is warming up. Even he seems to know the work is soul-killing. ""Theres no shame if you want to watch from the monitor"" he tells her during their first torture-training session an offer she refuses - as if watching from the monitor distancing oneself from the horrible reality would bring a kind of shame. You could read that as Bigelows view of torture too. There are several lines of dialogue put in the mouths of characters who are in a position to know that attest to the inefficacy of torture rather than its effectiveness. The movie takes the view in fact that Bin Laden was captured and killed thanks to a combination of intelligence (both the brain-cell kind and the government-sponsored kind) perseverance and more than a few strokes of dumb luck. Information gleaned by torture may have played a role but when Bigelow shows an instance of waterboarding its suffocating horror is precisely the point The sound of a man whos drowning or who even just believes hes drowning -- the cacophony of gurgling and choking -- is the stuff of nightmares and Bigelow doesnt shy away from it. Its worth remembering that her last movie ""The Hurt Locker"" was less about the horrors of war in any general sense than about the ways humans survive stress handling emotional strain not by breaking down but by getting tougher - sometimes until theres barely any self left. In the weeks since ""Zero Dark Thirty"" began screening for critics and other movie professionals the conversation has buzzed mostly around whether or not the picture glorifies torture. Yet that kind of interrogation figures in only a small portion of the film; Mayas obsession with getting information the right kind of information plays out in far more tedious tasks like tracing cell phone calls surreptitiously trailing suspicious vehicles and the like. Bigelow and Boal himself a former reporter who spent time embedded with a bomb unit in Iraq had access to officials with intimate knowledge of the Navy SEAL mission that eventually killed bin Laden (though they deny rumors that they had access to any classified information). But they dont get to that raid until the last 40 minutes or so of the picture. The first three-quarters of ""Zero Dark Thirty"" are precise and clinical almost to a Le Carre-like degree and the movies fixation on detail becomes hypnotic rather than boring. But the final section of ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is astonishing. Its more tense than it is rousing unnervingly suspenseful even though we all know how its going to turn out The action is staged in a way that drives home how wrong everything could have gone. Bigelow is an extraordinarily clear visual thinker maybe the finest weve got among directors currently working in the mainstream. She and cinematographer Greig Fraser map the actors movements with clinical precision; its always clear whos coming from where and the cutting by editors William Goldenberg and Dylan Tichenor is almost languorous. No one moves very fast which only heightens the sense that anyones fate could change on a hairpin turn. As those SEALs drop down into that compound equipped with night goggles that make them look like strange sea creatures or green-tinged rejects from some alternative Emerald City Alexandre Desplats score shifts into what sounds like a conscious nod to John Barrys stunning ""Capsule in Space"" from ""You Only Live Twice"" a theme thats both magisterial and mournful - its music that attaches a cost to experience. And when Bin Laden is killed the moment is swift efficient and grim. Minutes later the soldier who pulled the trigger recounts the event in one dazed oblique sentence unable to grasp the reality of it himself. Some may see jingoism or at least a sense of proud heroism in that moment. The team that killed Bin Laden should think of themselves as heroes; he was a geopolitical threat whose actions defied any kind of morality. Still Bigelow would rather send you shuffling out in silence than cheering. And the movies coda in which Maya reckons with what shes just pulled off - or doesnt reckon with it as the case may be - hits yet another off-chord of uncertainty. Its Chastains finest moment in a performance thats sturdy but not transcendent. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is precise definitive filmmaking yet Bigelow refuses to hand over easy answers. Some people call that evasion. I call it the ultimate despair.

In its narrative arc it is barely distinct from a boneheaded right-wing revenge picture but the vibe is cool brisk grown-up packed with impressively real-sounding intel jargon. And the hero is no gun-toting macho man. Shes a CIA agent named Maya (Jessica Chastain) a woman in a world in which men call the shots metaphorically and literally. Presented with the movies liberal-pleasing feminist overlay you root for her to compel the men to do what men would do naturally if they werent so constrained by modern technological and bureaucratic and constitutional hurdles find the motherfucker and blow his fucking head off. As a moral statement Zero Dark Thirty is borderline fascistic. As a piece of cinema its phenomenally grippingan unholy masterwork. The first masterstroke is the first thing you seeor rather dont see. Under a black screen the sounds of 9/11 build a hubbub of confusion reports of a plane hitting the World Trade Center and then most terribly the voice of a woman crying out to a 911 operator who tries vainly to assure her shell be okay. She wont be. That prologue looks like restraintthere are no sensationalistic imagesbut its cruel The recordings are genuine. You want revenge so much it hurts but youll have to live with the pain because the sonovabitch bastard Muslims who killed that poor woman are elusive and when you catch them they wont talk. The next scene a brutal interrogation at a CIA black site is unpleasant but not unwelcome. To paraphrase Dick Cheney you sometimes have to go to the dark side and the big bearded Dan (Jason Clarke) has made the trip telling a strung-up detainee When you lie to me I hurt you and he does. Yeah it sucks to have to torture peoplesucks for them and sucks for us. (Waterboarding someone is no fun.) But as Dan explains to Maya fresh off the plane from Washington that terrorist has to learn how helpless he is. There has been speculation that Maya was inspired by the same (covert) CIA agent as Claire Daness bipolar Carrie in Homeland. As Mr. Spock would say Fascinating. The parts and actresses could hardly be more different. Danes is a skin actor. Shes soft You read her pores. Chastain is a muscle and tendons actor You read the tension in her body. Watching Dan douse a screaming terrorist she folds her arms tightly across her chest her gaze jerking away involuntarily. But Maya is with the program. By the midpoint she looks like one of those college kids at exam time sleepless and sunless drooping under the weight of all the info shes cramming into her head her words rushing out as if one extra clause will make the difference between Osamas capture and escape. And by the end of Zero Dark Thirty Chastains Maya is in a different physical sphere. Theres no longer doubt in her. Friends have died she says adding I believe I was spared so I can finish the job. Who spared her? God? For this female ascetic killing bin Laden has become a religious questa counter-jihad. Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal (The Hurt Locker) dont give Maya or anyone else a backstory which is part of the movies cool The characters are only seen in the context of their jobs. But theyre not without personality. Aside from Chastain and Clarke who are riveting Jennifer Ehle is a treat as a high-spirited operative who seems to be based on Jennifer Matthews Mark Strong makes a forceful agency butt-kicker and James Gandolfini slyly underplays the CIA director. Boal is good at reproducing CIA jargon Even when I didnt know what the hell the characters were saying I nodded along thoroughly psyched out. This is top-secret intelligencejust being in the room is a privilege. Boal depicts much of Mayas job as a series of pitches not dissimilar to those in Hollywood. There is always another professionally skeptical CIA bureaucrat to be sold on the probable whereabouts of bin Ladens courierand then hell have to sell his superior wholl have to sell the commander-in-chief. Bigelow doesnt need narrative clarity to generate terrific suspense. Shes a wizard at mixing streaky middle-of-the-melee frames with stark establishing shots to give you your bearings. She saves the bravura stuff for the climax when the Navy SEALs finally make their entrance. Their choppers glide through the dark mountains toward the sprinkling of buildings in Islamabad. Alexandre Desplats chord progressions are mysterious suffused with awe. Night-vision goggles turn the silent compound green The camera follows the seals through doors and up stairs the only sound the bouncing of heavy equipment the bleating of sheep and then after the firing begins the sobbing of children. The carnage is quick and conclusive. 1 2 Next Share this story...

The last time such a device was used to evoke that tragic day without relying on explicit images of burning buildings was Michael Moores ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" which utilized reaction shots to underscore the human element of the devastation. In that context the intimation served to resurrect the anger and shock later appropriated to start a war. Bigelow a subtler filmmaker less driven by ideology than instinct applies a similar approach to convey more complex reactions driving the weighty historical drama about to unfold The utter chaos of fighting a losing battle and then clawing back to the top. Featuring another team-up with ""The Hurt Locker"" screenwriter Mark Boal Bigelows taut depiction of the decade-long hunt for Osama bin Laden is a true movie of the moment. In an alternate reality where bin Laden remained at large the filmmaker would have made ""Kill Bin Laden"" the earlier version of ""Zero Dark Thirty"" still in production when Barack Obama announced the Al Qaidas chiefs death at the hands of Navy SEAL operatives in May 2011. With bin Laden still on the loose it would remain thematically rooted in the darkness of the movies opening moments. Given the chance to give her story a happy ending Bigelow smartly blankets it in shades of ambiguity. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" tracks a full range of emotions associated with the proverbial war on terror from the naivete of its earliest stirrings to the spirit of vengeance that gave its apparent victory such a vital quality in the Western world. At the same time the movie questions the certitude of the transition from despair to triumph enabling ""Zero Dark Thirty"" to realize the power of its immediacy while giving the proceedings a lasting value. With ambitious young CIA agent Maya (Jessica Chastain) embodying the mixture of thrill and fury driving the hunt for bin Laden Bigelows engaging nail-biter avoids the pratfalls of ""spiking the football"" as the President described the danger of celebrating bin Ladens death. Instead its an opportunity to sober up. READ MORE Zero Dark Thirty On Criticwire From its pre-credits prologue ""Zero Dark Thirty"" jumps ahead to 2004 during a stage of investigation fraught with uncertainty when American intelligence still relied heavily on brash interrogation techniques. Set at a series of ""black sites"" in Pakistan and Iraq where American intelligence subjected prisoners to waterboarding and other violent means of obtaining whatever intel they could the story begins with Mayas arrival as a new recruit trained by a jaded interrogator (Jason Clarke) who quickly shows her the violent ropes. His brazen show of hostility toward the Al Qaeda operative in their possession mirrors the empty ""America Fuck Yeah"" attitude that defined immediate post-9/11 temperaments. ""This is what defeat looks like bro"" he tells the helpless prisoner while grasping at straws. Maya initially shocked by the situation manages to funnel that frustration into a cunning strategy as she grows into the role of mission leader. Boals screenplay encompasses years of events by boiling them down to Chastains commitment to her task which evolves past the dissolution of the U.S.s detainee program to a diversification of the strategy that eventually allows her to drop a pin on bin Ladens whereabouts. Rarely smiling or seen in repose shes a menacing figure of determination. We only know enough about Maya in the moment to watch how her anger over each subsequent failure makes her stronger -- and potentially more dangerous. Her burgeoning confidence is a realization of the John Wayne fantasy that the Bush administration constantly reached for. From her routine insistence that ""Im going to kill bin Laden"" she eventually gets the money quote when she speaks up in a strategy discussion about the possibilities of a raid.  ""Im the motherfucker that found this place"" she says indulging the aggression shes so frequently forced to keep pent up. Lacking certainty about bin Ladens whereabouts even in the moments leading up to that famous assault Mayas persistence involves an aspect of religious conviction that puts a human face on the confidential processes driving modern warfare. Shes a symbol with many layers. Given its scope and undulating feelings ""Zero Dark Thirty"" takes into account a series of shifting temperaments. Bigelow consolidates the past decade of 9/11 cinema with plenty of familiar ingredients whether or not theyre there on purpose. With James Gandolfini in a fleeting role as coarse CIA head Leon Panetta the actor virtually stumbles into the room straight out of ""In the Loop"" Armando Ianuccis brilliant satire of the institutional dysfunction that lead the country to war. While not a blatant satire ""Zero Dark Thirty"" similarly shows the delicate balancing act involved in wartime strategy always on the brink of turning sour. In more precise terms Bigelows ability to dramatize modern history known to many but only truly understood by a precious few mirrors the surreal quality of Paul Greengrass ""United 93"" which also managed to transform traumatic history into cinematic narrative. And from the burgeoning temperaments of post-9/11 warmongering found in the finale of Oliver Stones ""World Trade Center"" Boals screenplay eventually arrives at the uneasy mindset associated with a seemingly endless battle echoing Bigelows own ""The Hurt Locker."" Unlike ""The Hurt Locker"" however ""Zero Dark Thirty"" shows the cracks in planning stages outside the battle field. Boals dialogue constantly prances between false bravado and tentative belligerence a fascinating game of risk with echoes of ""Dr. Strangelove"" particularly once the Administration prevaricates over whether its worth the effort to send troops into the home where they believe Bin Laden hides. ""We dont know what we dont know"" somebody says a staggering admission that prompts the apt response ""What the fuck does that mean?"" Of course we know what they dont know which makes the finale such a juicy epilogue after so much chatter. The movies title refers to the 1230am raid on the Abbotabad compound where bin Laden was discovered and after spending over two hours demystifying the process behind that discovery Bigelow delivers an acute realization of the missions execution thats eerily in sync with the way it played in the popular imagination. Visually the events unfold as a mashup of shadowy movements with flashes of green night vision. Its simultaneously predictable and tense. Yet even as ""Zero Dark Thirty"" veers towards the inevitable victory march Bigelow observes the teams swift maneuvers without valorizing them leaving room for interpretation as to its moral certitude. Wherever you fall the climax contains serious payoff but then comes a final image that realizes the entire spectrum of post-9/11 trauma with hardly one word spoken. This telling coda brings us up to date with the one question Bigelows trenchant movie cant answer Now what? Criticwire grade A+ HOW WILL IT PLAY? Sony releases ""Zero Dark Thirty"" on December 19 followed by a nationwide rollout in January. It has strong prospects at the box office as the ideal ""smart"" year-end fare and should wind up as a major contender at the Academy Awards although the fall season is already fairly crowded so it still faces a good amount of competition.

The film is more mythic than actual a pure driven white red-haired northern european descendant is ritually purified through close calls and encounters with dirty dog-collared Arabic men. Youre watching a rigorous series of fictional sequences of London and the Islamabad Marriott conjoined with raw aftermath of bombings. The film is no more than a psyop made by private media to induce patriotism and cleansing our minds of the gravest activities of BOTH sides of a disastrous multi-front war that one body cannot simply appease. The torture youre seeing was dominantly used to induce connections between Al Qeada and Saddams Iraq (www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/the-interrogator/) instead of catch terrorists in the act. Do your homework. Dont be a mouthpiece for an ideology. Reply jake May 12 2016 252 pm ""Hes here BRB"" - a message sent in the film regarding a potential AlQ Qaida spy Thats how I felt about the movie. Reply S.M. Stirling May 12 2016 252 pm There are certain things that have to be said in public even in art (perhaps especially in art) despite the fact that theyre not true; in fact precisely -because- theyre not true. One of these is that revenge is ""empty"" and doesnt provide closure and leaves a sense of futility etc. etc. Actually revenge is extremely satisfying and fulfills a deep primal human need; it gives intense lasting pleasure. People may feel guilty about it but thats a learned response like feeling guilty about sex. By itself bloody murderous revenge on those we hate feels absolutely wonderful. The reasons we cant -say- this in public without extreme social displeasure (Ill probably get some here) are obvious but its true nonetheless. Thats why people spontaneously partied when OBL was killed; he was our enemy we hated him we killed him and felt extremely good about it. Objecting to this is as futile as objecting to the sex drive or competition for statu; its pure priggishness. Reply deb May 12 2016 252 pm Great review.

Running a dense two hours thirty before credits ""Zero Dark Thirty"" reunites director Kathryn Bigelow with reporter-turned-scenarist Mark Boal in re-creating the hunt for Osama bin Laden rejecting nearly every cliche one might expect from a Hollywood treatment of the subject. Far more ambitious than ""The Hurt Locker"" yet nowhere near so tripwire-tense this procedure-driven decade-spanning docudrama nevertheless rivets for most of its running time by focusing on how one female CIA agent with a far-out hunch was instrumental in bringing down Americas most wanted fugitive. Spinning the pic as a thriller Sony could beat the 9/11-movie curse when the Dec. 19 limited release goes wide in January. Opportunely held for release until after the presidential election had played out ""Zero Dark Thirty"" arrives shrouded in nearly as much mystery as bin Ladens whereabouts before news broke that a team of Navy Seals had successfully terminated his life on May 2 2011. The title military-speak for half-past midnight refers to the Al Qaeda leaders time of death theoretically promising a flashy first-hand account of the raid itself. But Bigelow and Boal reduce the spectacular assault on bin Ladens compound in Abbottabad Pakistan to the last half-hour in order to dedicate the rest of the film to the lesser-known backstory. By forcing partisan politics into the wings (President George W. Bush goes entirely unseen while auds only glimpse of President Obama is during a 2008 campaign interview) the filmmakers effectively give gender politics the whole stage The pic presents the highest-profile U.S. military success in recent memory as the work of a single woman ""Maya"" (Jessica Chastain) inspired by a real CIA analyst Boal discovered during his research and presented here as the only government official convinced that bin Laden wasnt ""hiding in some cave"" (Bushs words) but somewhere she could find him. Stepping up from a year busy with supporting roles Chastain may at first seem an unusual choice for the lead. But she shows she has the chops to embody the pics iron-nerved protag holding her own in the testosterone-thick world of CIA black sites and top-level Washington boardrooms. She first appears as witness to a military interrogation in which a colleague resorts to extreme measures to force information from an Al Qaeda money handler (Reda Kateb). Compared with her wild-eyed cowboy of a colleague Dan (Jason Clarke) Mayas body language suggests a little girl clearly uncomfortable with the waterboarding and sexual humiliation that were common practice in the morally hazy rendition era. When Dan leaves the room for a moment the desperate prisoner tries to appeal to her humanity. She wavers for only a moment before firing back ""You can help yourself by being truthful."" Unlike for instance Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling in ""The Silence of the Lambs"" Chastain plays Maya as fragile on the outside Kevlar-tough beneath the skin. After narrowly surviving one terrorist attack and seeing another promising lead literally blow up in a female colleagues face Maya grits her teeth and swears ""Im gonna smoke everybody involved in this op and then Im going to kill bin Laden."" Like Bigelow herself Maya realizes that actions -- or action movies in the directors case -- are the surest way to combat a tradition in which society doesnt believe women to be capable of getting the job done and ""Zero Dark Thirty"" follows the character through every significant step along her 10-year journey to hold bin Laden accountable for 9/11. The film opens with audio of a terrified victim of the World Trade Center attack playing over a black screen and uses the emotional power that clip dredges up to fuel everything that follows. The result is neither particularly entertaining nor especially artful as the filmmakers take a lean ""All the Presidents Men""-style approach to dramatizing an investigation that took nearly a decade to bear fruit. But Boal has clearly constructed this as a more journalistic alternative to a generic gung-ho approach. The scripts blood runs thick with observational detail and military jargon skipping forward years at a time between scenes to focus on one of two types of incident. The first concerns the slow but steady progress in Mayas investigation which hinges on her conviction that any clues they can discover about bin Ladens courier will eventually lead them back to UBL (the military acronym for bin Laden) himself. The second type involves an ongoing series of terrorist attacks that continue to claim lives as long as bin Laden goes free (never mind that they will not stop once hes dead). Bigelow keeps her audience on its toes by alternating between the two allowing virtually no room for subplots or superfluous character baggage beyond whats needed for the task at hand. With its handheld camerawork naturalistic lighting and dialogue-drowning sound design (especially heavy on ambient helicopters) the film reflects the latest fashion in cinematic realism compromised only slightly by the bare-minimum mood setting from Alexandre Desplats Middle East-inflected score. Chastains presence reminds us were watching a movie and yet this slight degree of self-consciousness serves to reinforce the point that its a woman pushing the process forward. Maya may not be made of the same stuff as her male colleagues but thats essential to the operations success. While those around her equivocate and refuse to take action she sticks to her guns and keeps track in dry-erase marker of the bureaucratic delays since theyve located bin Laden. Finally when the off-camera Obama gives her mission the green light Maya stares down a pair of cocky Navy Seals (Chris Pratt and Joel Edgerton) and tells them in no uncertain terms that she has no patience for their macho B.S. Only then does Bigelow offer auds what they paid to see a re-construction of the raid on bin Ladens compound. Virtuoso as the sequence is to behold it lacks both the detail of Matt Bissonnettes bestselling insider memoir ""No Easy Day"" and the visceral immediacy of this years earlier Seals-supported indie ""Act of Valor"" as well as the satisfaction of seeing the dead bin Ladens face (also withheld by the U.S. goverment). Dramatically speaking the raid feels almost anti-climactic -- an epilogue to a personal crusade that ends the moment Maya is taken seriously. Still considering how seldom female storytellers have been given a chance to operate on this scale its fair to let Bigelow overturn narrative expectations to some degree. The ultra-professional result may be easier to respect than enjoy but theres no denying its power both as a credible reimagining of what went down and a welcome example of distaff resolve prevailing in an arena traditionally dominated by men.

The suspect Ammar (Reda Kateb) believes he can withstand the waterboarding the dog collar the sleep and food deprivation the heavy metal music  that hammers his warehouse cell 24 hours a day; he boldly asserts that ""jihad will go on for a hundred years."" But as his captor Dan (Jason Clarke) patiently explains ""In the end bro everybody breaks. Its biology."" Ammar turns to Dans silent partner Maya (Jessica Chastain) and cries ""Your friend is an animal. Please help me."" The ordeal continues. Thats diplomacy by any means necessary. The 9/11 attacks instantly created a new world disorder changing the face of the enemy from cranky tyrants to a stateless ascetic with the dream of crippling infidel America. Al-Qaedas coup also rendered the old book of counterintelligence ethics obsolete. Bribes and blackmail were still permitted but no gentlemen or ladies needed enlist in the war on terror. The stakes were too high as Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal the director and writer of The Hurt Locker document in their powerhouse thriller Zero Dark Thirty. ""I want targets"" shouts George (Mark Strong) a high-level CIA official to his agents in the field. ""Do your f--in job. Bring me people to kill."" At this time Leon Panetta (James Gandolfini) is the CIA director and Maya has been working for years to locate Mr. Big -- to bring in the head of Osama bin Laden. (MORE TIMEs Review of The Hurt Locker) Surrounded by tattooed enforcers like Dan and upper-management toughies like George Maya at first seems as pale and petite as a naked mole rat. When Dan is transferred back home and Maya assumes control of the interrogations her boss warns her ""You dont want to be the last one holding the dog collar when the oversight committee comes."" But Maya has developed copper callouses and steely reserve especially after some of her closest colleagues were blown to bits in the 2009 suicide bombing at the Camp Chapman base in Afghanistan which killed seven CIA agents. Maya believes she was spared so she could finish the job. ""Im gonna smoke everybody involved in this op"" she says of the Camp Chapman attack. ""And then Im gonna kill bin Laden."" The making of Zero Dark Thirty which opens on Dec. 19 in a few theaters before expanding in January was an operation nearly as complex and secretive as the one that took down bin Laden. Some industry analysts inferring that the movie was all about the May 1 2011 SEAL Team 6 raid that killed the al-Qaeda leader wondered why a woman had the leading role. (The raid consumes just the final fifth of the movie.) The clandestine nature of the enterprise also stoked sepulchral suspicions both on the right and the center-left that ZDT would be a mash note to Barack Obama who gave the go-ahead for the raid while George W. Bush proclaimed in 2004 that ""I really just dont spend that much time on [bin Laden]"" and Mitt Romney in 2007 said it was ""not worth moving heaven and earth spending billions of dollars just trying to catch one person."" (PHOTOS Navy SEALs in Action) Before the movie had begun shooting New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd asserted that ""the White House has outsourced the job of manning up the Presidents image to Hollywood."" Peter King the House Republican who chairs the Homeland Security Committee promised an investigation of any aid the Obama Administration might have afforded Boal; and the Special Operations OPSEC Education Fund a political action group stocked with Tea Party Express members and ex-Bush officials involved in the Iraq war produced a YouTube video charging the film with ""dishonorable disclosures"" -- as if the Defense Department didnt pour millions into supplying hardware and expertise to Hollywood movies (Transformers Act of Valor and dozens of others) and government insiders didnt routinely spill secrets to journalists like Bob Woodward. And Dowd. For the record Bigelow received no help from the U.S. government -- no lending of aircraft or weaponry -- in the depiction of the Abbottabad Pakistan raid or of any other military activity. And we would hope that Boal like any investigative reporter received knowledgeable help in getting his facts straight. Further this is in no way a political film; it carries neither a torch for Obama (who is seen only for seconds promising in a 2008 news clip to end waterboarding) nor the agitated imprint of an Oliver Stone film. Essentially its a police procedural on a grand scale. (PHOTOS Special Ops A Photo History) First and last Zero Dark Thirty is a movie and a damned fine one. Like Argo -- which with all due respect to director Ben Affleck and the films many admirers ZDT blows out of the water -- it dramatizes a true-life international adventure with CIA agents as the heroes. (And it takes fewer fictional liberties with the source material than Affleck did.) In the tradition of Truman Capotes In Cold Blood and Tom Wolfes The Right Stuff Boal tracked down the particulars of a sensational exploit and skipping the ""nonfiction novel"" stage created an original screenplay that provides a streamlined timeline of the hunt for bin Laden. The word docudrama doesnt hint at Boals achievement. This is movie journalism that snaps and stings that purifies a decades clamor and clutter into narrative clarity with a salutary kick. (MORE TIMEs Review of Argo) Its a subject perfect for Bigelow. She has wrangled complex stories about cops (Blue Steel) undercover FBI agents (Point Break) and nuclear-submarine commanders (K19 The Widowmaker) and in the process proved herself to be one of cinemas most inventive visual strategists and field commanders -- and in a nice way Hollywoods ballsiest director. Perched between the serene classicism of old Hollywood and the jittery crazy-cam of the Bourne era Bigelows style is terse and assured. Theres no question which side shes on but she allows virtually all the characters American and Middle Eastern their moments of reason or sympathy. In this case she is neither prosecutor nor judge -- simply the sharpest most attentive member of the jury. In The Hurt Locker which won Oscars for Best Director and Original Screenplay Bigelow and Boal viewed the war on terror in a microcosm through the eyes of a trio of bomb defusers in Iraq. ZDT is a macrocosm. Instead of a Baghdad street where an IED could explode underfoot Maya and her colleagues tread a minefield that stretches from Kabul to Times Square. Though it focuses on the determination and resilience of Maya (who is based on a real CIA tracker) the film is a giant fresco an imposing series of surgical strikes set in Pakistan Afghanistan Saudi Arabia Kuwait Poland and the U.S. For a throbbing 2 hours and 40 minutes ZDT moves through enemy territory with the speed weight brains and grace of a Pro Bowl NFL linebacker; its the Lawrence Taylor of war-ops movies. (LIST 10 Greatest Movies of the Millennium Thus Far The Hurt Locker More) With the dense dialogue spread across more than 100 speaking roles the supporting actors could be mere information carriers but many make excellent use of their limited screen time Clarke as the hard-case interrogator with a Ph.D. Kateb as his victim-informer Kyle Chandler as Mayas suave cautious station boss Jennifer Ehle as a warm seen-it-all field agent and Edgar Ramirez as an operative who tracks bin Laden on an edgy ride through Islamabad. Chastain takes a while to grow into Mayas skin but her tentativeness in the early scenes may be an accurate depiction of a young woman just out of college enduring the growing pains of a difficult matriculation in a killer job. As a bright young woman driven to bring down an al-Qaeda terrorist Maya shares aspects of Claire Danes Carrie Mathison in the Showtime series Homeland but she lacks Carries defining neuroses -- and much other personal biography. What are Mayas political beliefs? Who are her family and friends back home? Does she have a sex life? Doesnt matter she is her job. In a way Maya is the CIA equivalent of Bigelow a strong woman who has mastered a mans game. (MORE Kathryn Bigelow Profile The Front Runner) At the end the woman who finds bin Laden also finds an end to her sacred obsession. And eight years to the day after Bush prematurely announced it a U.S. official has earned the right to proclaim ""Mission accomplished.""

Daily Edition Login to download Zero Dark Thirty Film Review 1202 AM PST 11/25/2012 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS The story of the hunt for Osama bin Laden builds relentlessly to a powerful end result. TWITTER Kathryn Bigelows and Mark Boals ""Hurt Locker"" follow-up tells the story of the hunt for Osama bin Laden and stars Jessica Chastain and Jason Clarke. Whether you call it well-informed speculative history docudrama re-creation or very stripped-down suspense filmmaking Zero Dark Thirty matches form and content to pretty terrific ends. A long-arc account of the search for Osama bin Laden seen from the perspective of an almost insanely focused female CIA officer who never gives up the hunt until the prey ends up in a body bag Kathryn Bigelows and Mark Boals heavily researched successor to Oscar winner The Hurt Locker will be tough for some viewers to take not only for its early scenes of torture including waterboarding but due to its denial of conventional emotionalism and non-gung ho approach to cathartic revenge-taking. Films touching on 9/11 such as United 93 World Trade Center and Extremely Loud amp; Incredibly Close have proved commercially toxic and while this one has a ""happy"" ending its rigorous unsparing approach will inspire genuine enthusiasm among the serious hardcore film crowd more than with the wider public. VIDEO Mark Boal Breaks Silence on CIAs Role in Zero Dark Thirty Even though it runs more than 2 1/2 hours Zero Dark Thirty is so pared to essentials that even politics are eliminated; theres essentially no Bush or Cheney no Iraq War no Obama announcing the success of the May 2 2011 raid on bin Ladens in-plain-sight Pakistani compound. Similarly absent is any personal life for the single-minded heroine; when its suggested at one point that she might want to have a fling she colorfully replies that shes not a girl who does that sort of thing. The film does question whether she gives up some of her humanity to so selflessly dedicate herself to this sole professional aim but seems to answer that for some this is what represents the essence of life; everything else is preparation and waiting. Its military-jargon title referring to a state of darkness as well as to the time of 1230 a.m. Zero Dark Thirty opens with 90 seconds or so of black screen accompanied by a soundtrack collage of emergency phone calls from people trapped in the Twin Towers; no need for the familiar visuals here. Cut to two years later when a captured nephew of Osama bin Laden undergoes a prolonged series of brutal CIA interrogations that involve beatings waterboarding being bound by a dog collar and ropes and getting locked in a small wooden box. Its not the most inviting way to usher a viewer into a movie. Then again the hunt for bin Laden was no picnic either; it was an enormously frustrating endeavor that untold amounts of money manpower and strategic thinking couldnt bring to a successful close for nearly a decade. The man who had engineered the deaths of some 4000 people became a phantom protected by forbidding geography loyal followers and an already legendary aura. VIDEO New Zero Dark Thirty Trailer You Will Never Find Osama bin Laden For a while as the film hopscotches through the years Boals script appears to be structured journalistically around a series of greatest terrorist hits so to speak We witness the deadly outrages of a 2004 attack in Saudi Arabia the 2005 bus and tube bombing in London the 2008 attack on the Karachi Marriott and the following year a shocking breach at a secured CIA base in Afghanistan. Connecting the dots however is the dogged presence of Maya (Jessica Chastain) a young flame-haired CIA officer who barely flinches when she first witnesses torture is described as ""a killer"" by a colleague and after a close call allows that ""I believe I was spared so I could finish the job."" Boal who dug as deeply into the classified aspects of the case as possible but seems to have been more committed to protecting the identities of those involved than even some participants have been has said that there really is a ""Maya"" though details have been fudged and altered to prevent identification. Given no backstory links to the world outside the CIA or any interest in small talk or other subjects Maya occasionally has a drink to unwind but otherwise seems entirely incapable of shutting down her laser-like focus of her obsession. She becomes tolerably friendly with a gregarious chatty female colleague (the ever-wonderful Jennifer Ehle) but most of the time is the only female in the room; she knows when to hold her tongue and her frustrations are legion but she also finds her moments to assert herself and speak out to superiors when she suspects her contributions are being ignored due either to her rank or because shes a woman. PHOTOS Hollywoods Special Forces Much as she did with the equally tightly wound protagonist of The Hurt Locker Bigelow sends Maya through a minefield this time consisting of bureaucratic trip-wires as well as potentially fatal traps. The director also successfully creates a double-clad environment that is both eerie and threatening that of the supposedly safe and protected enclaves of the CIA that exist within the larger context of the Muslim world. From very early on Maya seizes on the idea that the way to eventually track down bin Laden is to identify and follow his couriers as they will inevitably one day reveal where the Al-Qaeda leader is hiding. As we know shes right but it takes years for the tactic to pay off. Even once she and her cohorts track down the long-elusive Abu Ahmad following his vehicle through the chaotic streets of Rawalpindi is a nightmare. But after a succession of road blocks setbacks and dead ends Maya finally convinces herself that bin Laden is holed up in the house in Abbottabad whereupon her convictions ascend the ladder of command to the point where the CIA director (James Gandolfini) braces himself to enter the Oval Office and recommend a stealth raid to the president. Bigelow and Boal play a long game moving from the brutal opening through impressively detailed but not always compelling vignettes of the CIA at work to interludes in which Mayas ferocious dedication begins to possibly pay dividends and finally to the climactic 40 minutes which lay out with extraordinary detail and precision the almost improbably successful operation that begins at Area 51 in Nevada where we first see the amazing stealth helicopters ideally designed for such a mission and ends with Maya identifying the body thats brought back. PHOTOS Fall Movie Preview 2012 Major New Releases From Spielberg Jackson Tarantino the Wachowskis Burton and More In between is an exceptionally riveting sequence done with no sense of rah-rah patriotic fervor but rather tremendous appreciation for the nervy way top professionals carry off a very risky job of work; Howard Hawks would have been impressed. Slipping low through mountain passes in darkness from Afghanistan to Pakistan with rotor noise muffled by special equipment the two choppers drop off their Navy SEALs one then crashes in the yard but remarkably the noise seems not to arouse any locals just yet. The men all wearing helmets that bizarrely feature four night vision lenses protruding from the front proceed into the sealed-up house breaking down doors and exploding locks as they go. Instead of rushing the place as per usual cinematic practice they move slowly and cautiously room by room killing the messenger among others and encountering several women and many children as they go. The tall man remains elusive but there are still more doors to open. Still with each minute the danger of exposure and failure increases -- locals from the neighborhood are beginning to head toward the house -- and they still havent found their prize. Until finally they do. Because of the black-and-green video-like quality of the night vision imagery these momentous events possess the pictorial quality of low-budget Blair Witch/Paranormal Activity thrillers which merely contributes further to their weirdness. And because of the deliberate pace at which the men make their way through the house an unsettling airlessness sets in a feeling of being suspended in time thats unlike any equivalent climactic action sequence that comes to mind. But quite apart from its historical significance at least the scene is here to provide a welcome catharsis as at one time would not have been the case. The filmmakers initially embarked on this project before the bin Laden raid took place which obviously would have resulted in an entirely different sort of film dramatically and philosophically; without a resolution it could hardly have helped from being an existential tale of quite substantial dimensions. STORY New Documents Give Details of Bigelow Boals Access to bin Laden Raid As it has emerged instead Zero Dark Thirty could well be the most impressive film Bigelow has made as well as possibly her most personal as one keenly feels the drive of the filmmaker channeled through the intensity of Mayas character. The films power steadily and relentlessly builds over its long course to a point that is terrifically imposing and unshakable. Chastain carries the film in a way shes never been asked to do before. Denied the opportunity to provide psychological and emotional details for Maya she nonetheless creates a character that proves indelible and deeply felt. The entire cast works in a realistic vein to fine effect. Similarly all the technical contributions are put at the service of full verisimilitude. Locations in Jordan and India fill in beautifully for Afghanistan Pakistan and elsewhere.
