Comments (1) click to enlarge Runner Runner Video Rated R  91 minutes  2013 Brian Koppelman and David Levien who wrote Steven Soderberghs The Girlfriend Experience and directed the underrated Michael Douglas vehicle Solitary Man scripted this entertaining crime thriller which evokes classic film noir in its snappy dialogue and compact plotting. A hotshot finance student (Justine Timberlake) is taken under the wing of a shady online gambling tycoon (Ben Affleck) based in Costa Rica. What follows isnt very surprising--theres never a question of whether Affleck will set up Timberlake as a fall guy only a question of when--but the mannered speech is fun the players are charismatic and director Brad Furman (The Lincoln Lawyer) maintains an agreeably brisk pace.

Runner Runner Goes Splat << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Runner Runner Goes Splat 20th Century Fox Ben Affleck October 4 2013 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print With some thrillers you can tell everybodys lying. Its not because the writing says everybodys lying Its because thats what the acting is saying. In Runner Runner it looks like everybodys lying and thats only because the acting is pretty bad. The world of online gambling is meant to be the source of the movies thrill. Ben Affleck is Ivan Block the goony jawline behind a fraudulent poker operation called Midnight Black. One of its victims a Princeton brat named Richie Furst (Justin Timberlake) wants his money back. (Get in line Richie) The goon backs the brat into working for him in Costa Rica. The brat needs the money. He also needs the goon not to hurt his father. But the FBI -- represented by Anthony Mackie in the hat he wore in The Adjustment Bureau -- is closing in and so are the local cops. Will Richie help catch Ivan? Will Ivan stop feeding Costa Ricans to crocodiles long enough to notice hes being played? Is the government shutdown ever going to end? Sorry but I actually had that thought while this movie bored me stiff. Apparently Id rather be thinking about Congress than watching Justin Timberlake try to outsmart Ben Affleck. You dont believe that someone named Ivan Block would entrust so much of his shady empire and so much of his woman (Gemma Arterton) to a guy like Richie. Hes either a genius or a fool. Affleck doesnt choose. He makes himself sleek and slightly primitive enough to be interesting. Its his Boiler Room performance in a linen shirt. But for the movie to work at all you have to believe that Ivan cant tell that his girlfriend and Richie are lying about what theyre up to. At one point hes thought a few moves ahead of them sure. But for him to wind up where the screenplay puts him ultimately means that he has to ignore how much of an amateur Timberlake seems to be and how empty of purpose Arterton is. As an actor Timberlake is badly miscast. He makes sense in comedies. He can be physical and silly and push against the boundaries of a character. Appearing in almost every scene of a thriller -- even one as nominal as this -- requires cunning. And theres nothing cunning about him. Hes not a movie star the way hes a music star or a star on SNL. But the blame for Runner Runners badness isnt on Timberlake. Hes actually trying. The director on the other hand? Well Brad Furman cant whip this movie together. He dumps Tony Scott thriller music on every scene. He gives you a million cuts. He keeps the brown people in service positions. Furman likes assholes. He also made The Lincoln Lawyer that Matthew McConaughey courtroom sleeper hit from a couple years ago. With Runner Runner he has a similarly slick script. This is a sleazy-sexy 80s thriller that has no idea what sleazy-sexy is -- or is too scared of what it takes to go there. The movie needs to go off the rails. But its greedy and lazy. It only wants to go to the bank.

Whether its the stock market or real estate he tells us ""if youre risking something youre gambling."" That opening line makes it clear that ""Runner Runner"" isnt really about online betting. Its a metaphor for Wall Street of course. Its also a fairly brazen rip-off of a certain 1987 movie by that name.

""Runner Runner"" dresses up Oliver Stones ""Wall Street"" in the garb of ""The Social Network"" replacing traders terminals with sleek laptops and power ties with shiny casual shirts. High-rise balconies have become beachside infinity pools; midtown nightclubs are now raves (look for DJ Deadmau5 spinning tunes). Stepping into Charlie Sheens whiz-kid role is Justin Timberlake as Richie who discovers hes been swindled by a foreign-based site run by Ivan Block (Ben Affleck no substitute for Michael Douglas). Richie flies to Costa Rica to confront Ivan then starts working for him. The similarities continue John Heard plays Richies hangdog dad Gemma Arterton plays the high-class trophy and Anthony Mackie snarls (rather well) as an FBI agent who wants Richie to turn informant. ""Runner Runner"" might get away with the cribbing if it brought anything truly new to the table (the script is by Brian Koppelman and David Levien) but its only selling point is an above-average turn by Affleck cast against type as a charming villain. For once Afflecks superior slightly bored affect works in his favor. A little rough stuff might have goosed the movies energy but ""Runner Runner"" though rated R feels like a harmless PG-13. We hear talk of violence and dirty deeds but never see them which makes it difficult for us to truly fear Ivan -- whats so bad about the guy? -- or to sympathize with the knock-kneed Richie (Timberlakes pipsqueak performance doesnt help). Director Brad Furman (""The Lincoln Lawyer"") adds grit but only on the surface. 232 MoviesRunner Runner trailer ""Wall Street"" probed difficult questions about morality and capitalism but ""Runner Runner"" isnt thinking that hard.

"Runner Runner | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; runner-runner ) Runner Runner (United States 2013) October 04 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Runner Runner contains elements that if properly nurtured and presented could form the basis of a compelling film noir. Unfortunately director Brad Furman is less interested in developing characters and building tension than he is in shaking the camera whenever theres an action scene (of which there are surprisingly few) and rushing through the narrative so egregiously that the movie seems over before it starts to get interesting. Various subplots are given short shrift and the whole thing feels more like a Cliffs Notes version of a longer piece than an actual finished motion picture. Weve seen this film before. It was better when it was called Wall Street. Hell it was even better when it was called The Boiler Room with Ben Affleck essentially playing the same role he does here. You know the story the young hotshot gets in over his head while being tutored by a Machiavellian mentor whose ultimate goals diverge from those of his pupil. Theres a half-baked romance and some law enforcement interference. Unlike say Wall Street the ending is as dumb as it is disappointing. Theres not a lot to say about Runner Runner because the movie has low aspirations that it never rises above. Ben Affleck gets to chew on some scenery. In his big scene he seems to be trying (with little success) to channel Alec Baldwin from Glengarry Glenn Ross. Other than that hes the typical wolf in sheeps clothing. Justin Timberlake continues to intrigue with his charisma but hes still waiting for that ""plum"" role. Gemma Arterton is attractive in dresses that show off her long legs but shes criminally underused and her screen time is so limited that any chemistry she might have with Timberlake never gets a chance to manifest. Anthony Mackie doesnt have much more to do than Arterton but at least he gets two great one-liners. Runner Runner manages the difficult task of developing zero tension from a story that should be crackling with it. The problem is that Furman appears to be in a rush. This is no doubt partially the fault of the screenplay but there are scenes when the director bears the brunt of the responsibility. Consider for example a scene in which Timberlakes Richie Furst is strongarmed into taking a boat ride with a couple of goons. We dont know whats awaiting him on the other side or even if hes supposed to reach the other side. He has been courted by the Feds and has been laying groundwork for his own escape route but does the bad guy Afflecks Ivan Block recognize this? Instead of milking the trip for all the suspense it can deliver Furman hurries through it not giving us enough time to wonder whether Richie might be in danger before hes out of it. This isnt as isolated incident. When it comes to missed opportunities like this Runner Runner is a repeat offender. The film starts out strongly enough with Furst at Princeton trying to earn a Masters degree. To pay for his tuition he has become affiliated with a few online casino sites where he gets commissions for every player he signs up. The Dean takes a dim view of this and shuts Furst down. Desperate to obtain the 60K he needs to pay for the rest of his education he risks his entire savings in poker - and loses. When he realizes he was cheated he takes the improbable step of flying to Costa Rica and seeking out online gambling mogul Block. At their first meeting Furst impresses Block and the older man offers the brash kid from New Jersey a job with the promise of a seven-figure income. Who could turn that down? Another failing of Runner Runner is that despite providing a few tantalizing glimpses behind the curtain of online gambling it never goes the full Casino to flesh out the setting. Perhaps thats because the filmmakers felt it would slow down the breakneck pace. Or perhaps its because they didnt do their homework. Whatever the case its just another reason why Runner Runner ultimately feels hollow and incomplete.

Thats probably the main problem with the crime thriller Runner Runner a throwback to films like The Firm and The Devils Advocate and Wall Street in which hungry impressionable hotshots got sucked into alluringly deviant businesses. (Earlier this summer the corporate-espionage flick Paranoia tried to mine similar territory but it disappeared into the empty hole where its star Liam Hemsworth should have been.) But Affleck is chummy where he should be sleazy dickish where he should be monstrous. A bro-compliant version of Gordon Gekko it turns out is no Gordon Gekko at all. Our hero is Richie Furst (Justin Timberlake) a former Wall Street whiz kid who lost everything in the crash and now toils as a grad student at Princeton paying for his tuition by working as a freelance affiliate for an online gambling empire run out of Costa Rica by the mysterious Ivan Block (Affleck). When he loses a ton of money one desperate night on what appears to be a rigged game Richie runs the numbers and jaunts off to Central America to confront Ivan with the proof. The latter impressed by the kids determination hires him luring him with promises of six- and seven-figure paydays as far as the eye can see. Of course we know Ivan is dirty; we saw him bribing two U.S politicians with hookers before Richie ever got to Costa Rica. So the suspense lies not in wondering what Ivan is up to but in watching Richie get sucked into this money- and sex-drenched world. But director Brad Furman who made the solid similarly old-fashioned thriller The Lincoln Lawyer a couple of years ago is too methodical and he pulls back too much here. While we get numerous scenes of gorgeous women in bikinis and all-night parties featuring fire-breathing dancers and giant carnival masks and whatnot we never quite lose ourselves in the debauchery. (Michael Mann and Martin Scorsese are the masters of this but you dont need to be them to pull it off.) Meanwhile the film portrays Richie as a bit too savvy to be a self-deluded mark; hes more a Bud Light guy than a single-malt guy which in movie speak means hes smarter and more down-to-earth than everybody else. When the FBI shows up in the person of the wisecracking Agent Shavers (Anthony Mackie who gets all the films best lines) Richies refusal to help them feels hollow. Still it might have all worked if Affleck could muster up the requisite oily charm to make his character and his world irresistible or if Timberlake made for a more compellingly desperate hero. But the two seem so off that you actively start to re-cast the movie as you watch it. What if Ivan were older more aloof or Richie a bit dumber hungrier? Late in the film when Ivan decries Richies ""younger generation"" you start to genuinely wonder if the role was written for an older actor. With Affleck it gets an unintentional laugh. Runner Runner isnt entirely terrible. Theres a fairly solid idea in here somewhere and the script by Brian Koppelman and David Levien -- who wrote the beloved-by-poker-aficionados gambling thriller Rounders -- features lots of seemingly smart dialogue about ""non-weighted game theory"" and ""short-term variants."" (I say ""seemingly"" because being neither a poker fiend nor a statistician Im too stupid to tell whether its actually smart.) But maybe the movie is too smart for its own good. At one point we see Ivan feeding whole raw chickens to his pet crocodiles. We know the crocodiles will come into play later in the film; I wont say what actually happens but what does transpire is somehow both predictable and flaccid. You want the movie to get outrageous but its too dignified to go there. Much like its central villain it cant decide what it wants to be.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 04 2013 1201AM EDT Last updated Friday Oct. 04 2013 928AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Brad Furman Written by Brian Koppelman and David Levien Starring Justin Timberlake Ben Affleck and Gemma Arterton Classification 14A Year 2013 Country USA Language English The new Justin Timberlake thriller Runner Runner takes us inside the world of Internet gambling which proves every bit as fascinating as youd imagine by which I mean not at all. Even an incident-stuffed script from Brian Koppelman and David Levien (who wrote Steven Soderberghs Oceans 13 and The Girlfriend Experience) that includes kidnappings cigar-chomping Latino baddies on-tap prostitutes and crocodiles cant get us over the central problem with Runner Runner that gambling operations dont need to break the law to take all your money. Video Video Batman nerd explains why Ben Affleck is doomed to fail Actually theres only one real gambling scene in Runner Runner which takes place early and director Brad Furman (The Lincoln Lawyer) tries unsuccessfully to milk it. Justin Timberlake plays a Princeton grad student and former Wall Street trader with the absurdly Dickensian name of Richie Furst. He is desperately trying to earn his tuition in an online Texas hold em game. Richie had been paying his way through school by taking commissions on a betting site but the dean has just threatened him with expulsion. So he decides to earn his 60000 tuition with his savings. His anxious friends gather around to watch the screen while a girl massages his neck. Although hes a talented card player with a big math brain Richie loses and loses and loses. Later a statistician friend confirms Richies suspicion that the site must be rigged. Apart from the obligatory thriller scene of downloading data onto a USB key were spared the site of other computer screens.Instead Runner Runner turns into a horrible-boss story in the Wall Street or Devils Advocate line with Timberlakes frequent voice-over offering us this cautionary tale about the dangers of taking shortcuts to wealth. Richie decides to head to Costa Rica (portrayed as a one-dimensional third world pit of iniquity without an eco-tour in sight). Richie has brought evidence of the statistical anomaly to confront the websites kingpin Ivan Block (Ben Affleck).After sweet-talking Blocks alluring lieutenant Rebecca (Gemma Arterton in a glowing orange tan) Richie attends an exclusive party where he confronts Block with his accusations. Block dismisses him but a day later invites him on his boat. Ivan offers to cover Richies losses and throw in some goodwill money. And if the kid is interested hell offer him a job potentially leading to millions. The hook is baited and Richie bites.""I was in"" crows Richie on the voice-over. ""He needed some Princeton math and I gave it to him.""The offshore online gambling world as Furman portrays it looks pretty much like every other dizzy ascent into the criminal world portrayed in the movies whirling hand-held cameras stacks of cash bikini-clad women speed boats and aerial shots of fast cars all leading up to the inevitable FBI investigation. Whats missing is any real sense of suspenseful pace or menace.While Ivans fondness for feeding chicken carcasses to his pet crocodiles is vaguely amusing Affleck is unconvincing in this attempt at Michael Douglas-style sleazy cynicism. When he delivers a line like ""If you want a clear conscience go start a charity"" or he describes the FBI agent as working for ""chump change"" he sounds exactly like one of those embarrassing guys who try to speak in old movie lines to sound impressive.Otherwise Runner Runner is a bad run of cliche cliches. Even those of us without Princeton grad school education can guess Richie is being set up from the get-go and that eventually hell come up with a needlessly elaborate but simplistic revenge. Its obvious Timberlake is really well-cast as a naive financial wizard. Lots of cocky song-and-dance men have made great Hollywood stars - from James Cagney to Fred Astaire and Timberlake has the charisma and physical grace if given a chance to show it. Please find him a part involving a fedora and dance shoes so he can do something better with his time between making bestselling albums.

Photo Everett Collection Movie review Runner Runner one-and-a-half stars. Running time 91 minutes. Rated R (profanity violence sexual situations). At the Lincoln Square the E-Walk the Orpheum others. MORE FROM Kyle Smith Hillary is the smart kid but Trumps the bad boy -- and thats her problem Why white trash Americans are flocking to Donald Trump Indignation is an important devastating look at 50s youth Thrilling Nerve never takes its foot off the pedal Bad Moms good laughs Remember the old Ben Affleck the one who made 28 consecutive bad movies before he turned out to be a pretty good director? Hes back Behold the second coming of . . . Badfleck. Ben bless his impressive directorial skills on camera still looks only vaguely responsive to external stimuli as if hes waiting for his turn at the keg at the University of Vermont. He plays offshore gambling tycoon Ivan Block as in block of wood. Thatd be soft wood like pine or maybe balsa. At Blocks not-quite-legal outfit in Costa Rica he meets a furious customer Richie Furst (Justin Timberlake) who feels cheated by the computer poker program he used to play at Princeton. Instead of having him immediately shot Block becomes the first casino owner ever to admit cheating then offers Richie a job supposedly because he fears the mighty power of a Princeton student spreading rumors about the integrity of his site. At other times though were supposed to think Block is some sort of online Scarface though given that its Affleck hes more like Blankface. As a random girl (Gemma Arterton) who doesnt seem particularly fascinating to either man flits in and out of the scenery Affleck and Timberlake face each other down each trying to outmuscle and outscam the other. At no point does either of them seem at all dangerous. Its like a cockfight between declawed pussycats. Timberlake babbles about algorithms and were supposed to buy Affleck as the kind of man who feeds his enemies to crocodiles. Affleck wants us to think Robert De Niro in ""Casino"" but I was more scared of Robert De Niro in ""Little Fockers."" When Richie gets in too deep an FBI man (Anthony Mackie) offers him a possible way out if hell turn rat but Richie has a better idea Hell simply bribe everyone in the country. I dont know how thats supposed to work since Block has already been bribing everyone for years with a million times more money and firepower than Richie has but maybe everyone in Costa Rica really liked ""D - - k in a Box."" By the way at what point will Hollywood realize that a five-minute video isnt quite as useful as five feature-length films in determining whether Timberlake is a movie star? He isnt. Hes proven it. Lets retire him and give Lance Bass a chance. Ill give the movie credit for coming up with a few lines of nasty dialogue and cool-sounding poker slang. Theres also one brilliant joke Mackies FBI man tells Richie he loves to bust Princeton men. Pause. ""I went to Rutgers."" But the director Brad Furman never manages to stir up any excitement or menace. How can we blame him when the script calls for Affleck to gaze manfully at Timberlake and say ""I look at you and I see myself. Youve got the same f -  - k-you look in your eye."" Can you think of any two actors who have less danger coming out of their eyeballs? OK maybe Michael Cera and Neil Patrick Harris but you dont see either of them trying to play a hard case. Possibly the most honest moment of the film comes when offered a single-malt scotch Timberlakes character says no thanks hell just stick with his Bud Light. Bud Light is fizzy its low-potency its completely lacking in flavor. Its Justin Timberlake in a can. As for Affleck hes equally useless as an actor but in a throwback way cinematic Zima.

There is a younger hotheaded gambler who has made his way into that mans inner circle. And there is a woman. There is always a woman. But this isnt ""Gilda"" -- not quite. This is ""Runner Runner"" a new movie about online rackets. And while its made by people who know a little about movies and maybe even more about cards theres still some blame to be assigned. But to whom? Screenwriters Brian Koppelman and David Levien also wrote ""Rounders"" about 15 years ago and have since turned out a couple of movies about sharpies (although my favorite was the regretful Michael Douglas picture about midlife crises ""A Solitary Man""). They know the material. And although Brad Furman -- who also made ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" -- is no great auteur hes competent. Theres nothing flashy here -- and honestly a movie full of gambling crooked cops and man-hungry alligators could use a little flash. But the scenes are shot cleanly and he gets the most out of his locations. Still somehow the cards just dont come together. The story begins in New Jersey where Justin Timberlake is a Princeton grad student. (OK maybe standards have slipped.) But hes a bit of an operator and things soon get worse when he bets his tuition money on what later seems like a crooked game of online poker. So he decides to go down to Costa Rica where an American exile runs the whole operation and confront him. Bad idea possibly (and definitely an improbable one) but somehow Timberlake manages to meet the guy who turns out to be the older slicker Ben Affleck. And instead of feeding Timberlake to his gators he decides to hire him as his assistant. Which goes fine for a time. Until these two gamblers start playing other games for high stakes and a red queen joins the play. This is actually a good beginning and while I wish theyd had the nerve to borrow riskier things from ""Gilda"" -- like the implication that the older gambler had an erotic fixation on the younger one -- the movie gets the cloying lavishness of high-roller action just right. Its actors are well cast too mostly. Although Timberlake is no ones idea of a tough guy he does look like someone who could easily get in over his head. And Affleck has always been best -- ""Boiler Room"" ""Changing Lanes"" ""Hollywoodland"" -- playing characters whose morals are flexible at best. Seriously disappointing though is Gemma Arterton whos been given a spray-on tan but very little to do as the woman who comes between them. The character is supposed to be mysterious but the only one she mystifies is the actress who doesnt get her or how to get us interested. Perhaps there was more here at one point. ""Runner Runner"" -- which finishes its own course in a brisk 91 minutes -- feels as if it may be missing a few scenes. Not only is Artertons character a bit vague but other characters pop in and out and some of the plotting (particularly as the two men turn on each other) leaves questions. Affleck and Timberlake are fun to watch the Costa Rica locations (actually Puerto Rico) are pretty and Anthony Mackie gets some good lines as the FBI agent who likes throwing Princeton guys in jail because ""I went to Rutgers."" The film will make a decent rental in a few months time. But to lay down good money now to see it in a theater? Thats a chumps move. Ratings note The film contains sexual situations substance abuse strong language and violence. Runner Runner (R) Fox (91 min.) Directed by Brad Furman. With Justin Timberlake Ben Affleck.

Math whiz Richie Furst (Justin Timberlake left) tangles with online gambling kingpin Ivan Block (Ben Affleck) in ""Runner Runner."" Photo Scott Garfield Twentieth Century Fox Runner Runner review Gambling story a losing bet 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Runner Runner Drama. Starring Ben Affleck Justin Timberlake and Gemma Arterton. Directed by Brad Furman. (R. 91 minutes.) ""Runner Runner"" is less than mediocre but its not repellent which means that to watch it is to root for it - and to be disappointed. Throughout its easy to see the kind of movie its trying to be and that kind of movie is appealing - glamorous full of intrigue and adventure. ""Runner Runner"" isnt that but if you screw up your eyes and squint while watching it sometimes looks that way. Its a curious thing how much can be accomplished with atmosphere. The setting is Costa Rica where an online gambling kingpin Ivan (Ben Affleck) rules over his empire. There are sports cars nightclubs expensive clothes yachts and beautiful women so its no hardship to hang out with Ivan even if you cant really go to his parties - even if you can only watch from a seat in the movie theater. Yet the clumsiness of the storytelling is apparent from the first minutes. At first its intangible. You can just feel the filmmakers moving things into place like heavy furniture theyre accidentally dropping on their toes Justin Timberlake plays Richie a Princeton math whiz going for his masters who loses over 17000 on a gambling site. Because he knows math he knows - and can prove - that the site has cheated him and so he goes to Costa Rica to confront the man who took his money. What he finds is the person hed most like to be someone who could be his cool older brother. As Ivan Affleck has never looked better in his life. He looks like money and money is what Ivan offers Richie in the form of a dream job. For running part of Ivans business Richie is guaranteed seven figures the first year and eight figures the next and all of it earned in a tax-free paradise. Not surprisingly Ivan is the movies best character its only amusing creation. Hes breezy and relaxed; nothing seems to bother him and at first he seems like the ideal boss. In one scene he hands Richie a huge bonus tells him to ""spend it all in one place"" do something ""degenerate"" and ""do it in my car."" Who wouldnt want to work for an upstanding citizen like that? The only question is whether Ivan is breezy because he has no worries or because he doesnt care whether anybody else lives or dies. Alas the pleasures of watching Affleck as Ivan amount only to small scenes and a smart line here or there. The main focus is Richie who has two disadvantages as a protagonist He is completely ordinary and he is not self-determining. ""Runner Runner"" being badly plotted gives us a lead character who cant really determine his own fate who is more or less at the mercy of events. Or maybe he is in control and its just not obvious from the way the movie unfolds. Which brings us to another problem Crucial events happen offstage and are then announced to the audience. And every so often its difficult to track which minor character exactly is getting thrown into the swamp to be eaten by alligators. Two-thirds of the way in we barely know whats going on. Timberlake is easy to take but in a movie where hes worried much of the time he doesnt get to rev up the charm. Affleck relishes the chance to play the bad guy and his pleasure is contagious but sooner or later the story and the script have to kick in and they never do at least not in a good way. ""Runner Runner"" is a losing bet. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

"Review Runner Runner runs hot cold with Ben Affleck Justin Timberlake - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Runner Runner runs hot cold with Ben Affleck Justin Timberlake Runner Runner Movie review by Betsy Shakey Betsy Sharkey reviews Runner Runner starring Ben Affleck Justin Timberlake Oliver Cooper and Anthony Mackie. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Betsy Sharkey reviews Runner Runner starring Ben Affleck Justin Timberlake Oliver Cooper and Anthony Mackie. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Only one word describes the effect of watching Ben Affleck slowly dial down the temperature one degree at a time in ""Runner Runner"" Cool. Frank Sinatra cool.He stars as sociopathic online gambling mogul Ivan Block and if that role doesnt sound cool you havent seen Affleck at the controls. Justin Timberlake costars as Richie Furst a Princeton whiz kid also cool. Not as cool as Block. Nor as keen on the whole sociopathic lifestyle. The moneys great but feeding enemies to the crocodiles crosses some lines.But were not there yet. PHOTOS Movie Sneaks 2013First were introduced to Richies very profitable campus online gambling services with all the money going to a good cause called tuition. After he gets on the deans list -- and not in a good way -- his fortunes change. Smart guy that he is Richie decides he can beat the online gambling odds and cover his Princeton bill. When that doesnt work he tracks down the guy whose online operation cheated him the legendary Ivan Block.Great clothes great presence great-looking COO Rebecca Shafran (Gemma Arterton) Block is a smooth operator with great expectations when it comes to Richie. He extends an offshore offer the kid cant refuse. FBI agent Shavers (Anthony Mackie) who has made the mogul and his Costa Rican enterprise a special project has an offer of his own.The question is who is bluffing whom? My bets on Block no matter how the movie plays out. He is one killer of a character and Affleck plays him like a Bach concerto -- every note perfectly played. Loved Affleck in ""Argo"" and ""The Town"" but this particular Machiavellian turn reminds me more of his troubled George Reeves in ""Hollywoodland."" Something about the set of the jaw the seduction in the eyes.PHOTOS Billion-dollar movie clubThe crime thriller is directed by Brad Furman who has a habit of falling in love with certain characters as he did Matthew McConaugheys back-seat attorney in ""The Lincoln Lawyer."" It means he tends to forget to pay enough attention to the rest. Hes done it again with Block. Richie and Rebecca deserved more.There are other challenges primarily a spotty script by Brian Koppelman and David Levien. They have written other manipulation stories among them the teasing ""Oceans Thirteen"" and to my mind their best the tense ""Runaway Jury."" But in ""Runner Runner"" theyve gotten completely caught up in explaining the specifics.There is what amounts to an on-screen tutorial about online gambling with a series of news clips decrying the practice and actual computer screen demonstrations. Yawn.They get into why Blocks business is offshore as if terms such as ""illegal"" and ""money laundering"" are new to the lexicon. They throw in Richies dad Harry (John Heard) a low-end poker player and a cheat then write ""fall guy"" all over him.Wake me up when this is over.PHOTOS Greatest box office flopsFortunately we do have Timberlake. He has a way of breathing life into even deadened moments. You want to watch him. But like most stars his acting is better when the plotting is smarter. ""Runner Runner"" too often sends Timberlake running down a blind alley when he should be out on a scary limb or twisting in the wind so we have something to worry about. This is billed as a crime ""thriller"" after all.There are many bribes and betrayals in ""Runner Runner"" a few twists on trust and some surprise appearances by Agent Shavers whose outrage Mackie makes fun.Arterton is a very appealing Brit still looking for one of those breakout roles. And no I do not count ""Clash of the Titans"" or ""Prince of Persia The Sands of Time"" no matter how big their budgets. She and Timberlake have good chemistry on the few occasions Furman lets them bring sexy back.A little romance is a nice break from all the money stuff. I never realized how boring it is to watch someone count it or deliver it or receive it. Not even when cinematographer Mauro Fiore with an Oscar for ""Avatar"" is shooting the rich the impoverished and the beautiful beaches of Costa Rica with such a discerning eye.The struggles in the movie are with the moments when life and liberty are on the line. The ones that should put you on the edge of your seat are more likely to have you glancing at your watch.Even with Affleck doing his Rat Pack best by the end of ""Runner Runner"" the chill is gone. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com----------------------------------- Runner RunnerMPAA rating R for language and some sexual contentRunning time 1 hour 31 minutesPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Ben Affleck Justin Timberlake Lifestyle and Leisure Entertainment Reviews Movies Crime Law and Justice Justin Timberlake Career in pictures Ben Affleck on Batman backlash Im a big boy Review Justin Timberlake edgier on 20/20 Experience -- 2 of 2 Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad83deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-runner-runner-20131004,0,6353685.story?track=rss",200,runnerrunner12,runnerrunner,latimes

(Josh Weinstock/AP) By Ann Hornaday October 3 2013 Follow AnnHornaday The title of ""Runner Runner"" a drama set in the world of online gambling refers to a term of art in poker defined by Wikipedia as a circumstance in which a hand is made by drawing two consecutive cards on the turn and river and . . . oh forget it. Are your eyes glazing over? Mine too. When it comes to this movie and the other direction run run -- dont walk walk. A dreary perfunctory amorality tale that isnt ashamed to sneak in admiring winks at the world it pretends to scorn ""Runner Runner"" stars Justin Timberlake as Richie an online poker whiz who is paying his way through Princeton when he encounters a cheater on the Web site that pays him to recruit new players. No sooner does Richie twig whats going on than -- hey presto -- hes on a plane to Costa Rica where he intends to confront the sites chief a Gatsbyesque figure named Ivan Block (Ben Affleck). Impressed by the younger mans gumption Ivan persuades Richie to stay and work for him as tummler foil enforcer and finally useful idiot when the U.S. feds come a-knockin. Written by Brian Koppelman and David Levien presumably by cobbling together remnants of their far better 1998 ""Rounders"" script ""Runner Runner"" is a talky inert enterprise composed mostly of Timberlake spouting statistics percentages and poker jargon while Affleck affects the too-cool air of a cyber-era mob boss too genteel to get his hands really dirty. Director Brad Furman -- who made the terrific and underseen 2011 thriller ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" -- hops from one scene to another with cartoonish alacrity blithely glossing over details like logic and motivation to put his characters where they need to be in order to get to yet the next pat too-tidy scene. (Early in the film Richie needs to talk Ivans beautiful assistant played by Gemma Arterton into letting him into an exclusive decadent party -- a song and dance we can assume must have been brilliant considering that hes walking through said soiree just moments later.) Afflecks nasty natty crime lord is the one vivid character to pop out from an otherwise humdrum exercise The filmmakers apparently want viewers to take it on faith that Costa Rica is tantamount to the 21st-century version of Batista-era Cuba without conveying a scintilla of genuine atmosphere danger or tawdry glamour. The one exception might have been that over-the-top party which here looks like it was filmed in a back yard in Los Angeless Hancock Park. Timberlake has been good in movies (""Black Snake Moan"" ""The Social Network"" and the upcoming ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" are just three examples) but here he takes on the by-the-numbers blandness of his formulaic surroundings. The film might take its name from poker subculture but it lacks all the urgency single-mindedness and swiftness that the title implies at its most literal. ""Runner Runner"" is a bummer. Bummer. Runner Runner 1/2 (91 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for profanity and some sexual content. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Few betting men would wager on Ben Affleck being the highlight of a movie but thats how the cards fall in Runner Runner. The future caped crusader brings a casual bemused menace to the role of an American businessman running an online-gambling empire from balmy Costa Rica far from the reach of U.S. law. Less mogul than kingpin Affleck bribes the local authorities blackmails competitors into merging with his site and--in the films most outrageous act of criminality--dumps chicken fat over his rivals and kicks them to the alligators. Is the world of Internet poker really so seedy its entrepreneurs so ruthless? To hear Runner Runner tell it all the violence and vice gamers avoid by playing online can be found by tracing the servers to their Central American source where web barons recreate casino culture without the casino. Unlikely as it may sound thats by no means the least plausible element of this generic crime opus penned by the same screenwriting duo--Brian Koppelman and David Levien--who wrote 1998s cult card-shark drama Rounders. If that sleeper arrived about five years too early to capitalize on the Texas hold em craze its descendant seems about a half-decade late to the table. Not that its really about poker at all While Rounders memorably steeped audiences in the specifics of the high-roller life--the lingo the tricks of the trade the flavorful atmosphere of New York gambling dens--Runner Runner could basically be set against the backdrop of any lucrative field. Only some voiceover musings imparting nuggets of dual-purpose wisdom like ""The House always wins"" suggest the work of the same writing team. Surprisingly bland in a role hes a little too old to occupy Justin Timberlake plays the films Princeton protagonist a supposedly sharp fellow convinced that the best recourse for getting back his tuition nest egg lost to grifters during a high-stakes online poker game is to fly south to confront the sites notoriously dangerous owner. Lo and behold this risky play pays off as Afflecks unflappable tycoon takes the Ivy Leaguer under his wing ushering him into his cutthroat business. But does the high life come with a price? Runner Runner is a run-of-the-mill rise-and-fall story treating its hero to fabulous exotic luxury before tugging the rug out from under him. In way over his head Timberlake is quickly torn between competing interests with the increasingly unscrupulous Affleck sending him blindly into danger while overzealous FBI agent Anthony Mackie tries to scare the kid into selling out his mentor. Naturally theres also a potential femme fatale (Gemma Arterton) though the movie resists turning her tryst with Timberlake into a source of danger. (""Do what you want"" Affleck tells his philandering moll. ""I know I do."") In different hands Runner Runner might have worked as sleazy tropical noir but director Brad Furman (The Lincoln Lawyer) never quite embraces the tawdriness of his material. (He directs as though he tried and failed to get a PG-13 rating.) Nor does the movie excel as a financial-collapse parable even as it draws easy parallels between the corruption of the offshore gaming industry and that of Wall Street. Piling cons and reversals on top of each other the screenwriters play their hand as predictably as a fish at a table full of sharks. The only real surprise here is seeing Timberlake lose in a heads-up charisma contest with Affleck. What were the Vegas odds on that ever happening?

Grade C- With a lot of clever rejiggering this flaccid gambling/caper film could have been a TV pilot that had you asking ""what comes next?"" instead of a feature that leaves you grumbling ""Thats all there is?"" The movie is like a set-up to a set-up. It puts a quartet of characters in play and stops when things might just get interesting -- after the Princeton-educated patsy Richie Furst (Justin Timberlake) proves himself equal in cunning to his sleazy boss Ivan Block (Ben Affleck) who runs an online gambling empire from Costa Rica. ""Runner Runner"" boasts actors whove proven their ability to surprise and delight audiences. They cant do it here. Director Brad Furman (""The Lincoln Lawyer"") and screenwriters Brian Koppelman and David Levien (""Rounders) stick them in a story thats simultaneously rote and frenetic. Gemma Arterton who was a sensational vampire in Neil Jordans ""Byzantium"" once again barely casts a shadow - this time in a bad way. She plays Rebecca Shafran Ivans voluptuous morally ambiguous business partner and one-time lover. You cant tell whether shes sincere when she switches her allegiance to Richie a younger and potentially more virtuous hot shot. Anyway Timberlake shares more chemistry with Anthony Mackie (""The Hurt Locker"") as Ernie Shavers a fierce few-holds-barred FBI man angling to bring down Ivans business. The sole original moment comes when Richie gets Ivans attention by flying to Costa Rica and contending he has proof that Ivan cheated him. His method of doing it reminded me of Bob Dylan displaying his lyrics on poster-boards in his proto-music video for ""Subterranean Homesick Blues."" After that its all downhill - or to be fair a frantic downhill slalom. Ivan tells Richie that rogue underlings are responsible for rooking the fresh-faced kid. He seduces Richie into working for him for seven figures in his first three months and eight figures after that. Dazzled by the money - and by Ivans lush tropical empire (Puerto Rico stands in for Costa Rica) - Richie proves remarkably open to practicing extortion and delivering payoffs. He starts to turn on Ivan only after he realizes that hes in a mortally risky business. Richie resents the tactics and resists the wisdom of Ernie the FBI man when he reveals the full extent of Ivans corruption. So its hard to credit Richie as a character with conscience. All the characters who are supposed to supply this antihero-turned-hero with emotional ballast evaporate after a few scenes including Richies deadbeat regretful father Harry (John Heard) and his obligatory chubby jolly geek pal Andrew Cronin (Oliver West). Andrew is actually crucial to Richies survival and redemption. But after he disappears and is presumed dead the script accounts for him in one bland affectless line of dialogue. Richie doesnt shed a tear for him. The whole movie shows signs of squeezing whether in the script development process or the editing room. Timberlake and Arterton lack any palpable sensual affinity. So its hard to care about Richie and Rebecca as a couple even though the climax hinges on their love match. Mackie gets his laughs by playing a lawman like a hoodlum. Similarly Affleck gets his laughs by playing an evil sleazy kingpin like a country-club corporate honcho convinced of his rectitude. Sadly neither wins even a Pyrrhic victory. With the right director Timberlake could have turned Richie into the kind of suave professional gambler that audiences love - a latter-day version of Cary Grants good-bad guy Mr. Lucky or the totally good Mr. Lucky of the Blake Edwards TV series. Instead he comes off as the kind of slick doofus who even adjusted for inflation is still a dime a dozen. Contact the writer msragowocregister.com Most Popular U.S. Open of Surfing Will you marry me?

He becomes a Princeton grad student/gambling whiz then casually tosses his education away and is sucked into the world of online wagering.For context a few establishing headlines and news snippets are shoehorned in to let us know that online betting is a growing practice on university campuses. Richie is a kind of Joe College bookie hustling his classmates -- and even a few professors -- onto an Internet poker site.When Richie loses his life savings -- which just about covers the cost of one terms tuition at Princeton -- he deduces its a swindle and hops on the next plane to Costa Rica to face the guy who done him wrong. He gets his money back -- no joke -- but is seduced by the lure of fast-track wealth.REVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersThe refund and seduction are courtesy of an even richer guy with fewer scruples -- as in none. This Costa Rica-based CEO is gambling tycoon Ivan (Ben Affleck). When a character is named Ivan hes bound to be terrible. Everything in the movie is just that obvious including the clunky expository voice-over narration.One of the films biggest problems is that Richie is an unsympathetic and rather dim character. The badly drawn role does the likable Timberlake no favors. The talented singer/actor was better in The Social Network Friends With Benefits Alpha Dog and almost any SNL skit. He plays a Wall Street weasel who decides to go back to school when his other options disappear and he contributes to the gambling addictions of students and professors. Hes hardly a figure of integrity. When a teacher approaches him for help with a bad bet he placed Richie shrugs him off arrogantly. Consequently its hard to care much when he gets used by Ivan.Gemma Arterton plays Rebecca Richies love interest and also the COO of Ivans gambling empire. Richie and Rebecca look good together but have a lackluster chemistry.Meanwhile the feds are closing in on Ivan. FBI Special Agent Shavers (Anthony Mackie) is building a case against Ivan for racketeering extortion bribery and other unsavory practices.Ivan is a devious and clever fellow. Affleck is at his best when his character is most malicious. Not only does he seem to be having fun with the role but his Spanish is terrific. Audiences can debate whether he ought to play Batman but his linguistic ear cannot be disputed.Richie on the other hand is not as bright as his Ivy League admission would indicate. Its glaringly obvious that his new boss is up to no good. But Richie is an odd mix of savvy and naive. It takes a few beatings and double-crossings before his IQ points seem to register. And when they do it comes to a pretty anti-climactic conclusion.When the story lags director Brad Furman resorts to focusing on shots of chomping crocodiles.But neither toothy reptiles nor stunning beachside vistas (actually shot in Puerto Rico) offer enough risk or reward to make this gambling thriller worth betting on. 8 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1fMtlbEFall Movies Calendar OctoberTake a look at the films heading to the box office this October.

"Runner Runner (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Runner Runner (R) Justin Timberlake and Ben Affleck are wasted in this wan formulaic crime drama. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com10/3/2013 Editor rating 1 In Runner Runner a Princeton math genius (Justin Timberlake) who has cultivated a lucrative side gig via online poker loses his life savings and flies to Costa Rica to confront the magnate (Ben Affleck) who may have cheated him out of his money.  In its early moments the movie evokes everything from The Social Network to Casino. By the end the film has become as exciting as a game of Old Maid. R-rated thrillers are hardly ever this dull and listless but this movie manages to eradicate all of Timberlakes charisma and makes you flash back to Afflecks Paycheck/Gigli era. How does this even happen? Sometimes films just turn out wrong. Director Brad Furman (The Lincoln Lawyer) working from a script by Brian Koppelman and David Levien (Rounders Oceans Thirteen) presumably set out to make a compelling crime drama set against an unusual backdrop. What they wound up with is yet another slick and generic tale about a young man who dabbles in a life of crime discovers its not for him and turns on his mentor. Nothing in the movie rings true not the FBI agent (Anthony Mackie) willing to break the rules in order to get his man nor the ambiguous romantic interest (Gemma Arterton) who may be running her own scam nor the crooked Costa Rican cops and politicians who seem to do nothing other than get drunk with hookers smoke cigars and wait for their latest bribe money to be delivered. Movies about poker usually like to bluff and surprise the audience. But Runner Runner which teaches you absolutely nothing about the phenomenon of Internet gambling doesnt have a single twist in store. The film is so rote and transparent you keep waiting for a big reveal or curve -- something anything that would explain Timberlakes and Afflecks presence here other than the opportunity to spend several weeks in beautiful Puerto Rico (where the movie was filmed). Nothing about Runner Runner makes sense Not its R rating which could have easily been avoided with the removal of a couple of f-bombs; not the intermittent voiceover narration by Timberlake which is used to plaster over plot holes; not even the participation of Leonardo DiCaprio as one of the films producers. Was this an early project he once considered starring in that just never got made?  By the time characters start spouting lines such as ""What are you saying? This whole thing is a Ponzi scheme?"" desperation has set in. Runner Runner which never even bothers to explain its title (its a poker term) may not be the years worst movie. But its a strong contender for the most boring. Here is a film in which a man is covered in chicken fat and thrown into a pit of crocodiles and you still can barely keep your eyes open. Cast Justin Timberlake Ben Affleck Gemma Arterton Anthony Mackie John Heard Michael Esper. Director Brad Furman. Screenwriters Brian Koppelman David Levien. Producers Arnon Milchan Jennifer Davisson Killoran Leonardo DiCaprio. A 20th Century Fox release. Running time 91 minutes. Vulgar language sexual situations adult themes.

When its time for the hot sex scene between Timberlakes ambitious Richie Furst and Rebecca (Gemma Arterton) his bosss luscious second-in-command the encounter is as chemistry-free as the wooden banter that has led up to it. Ive had dentists appointments that were sexier. Director Brad Furman (""The Lincoln Lawyer"") and his cast put their money on a dud script -- a drama about a naive upstart and the corrupt online-gambling tycoon who seduces him with riches -- and lose.

By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 433pm on Thursday Oct. 03 2013 Thursday Oct. 03 2013 Saturday Oct. 05 2013 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Do Ben Affleck and Justin Timberlake who together should have enough cash to make Midas jealous need a payday this badly? Thats the only real mystery at the heart of Runner Runner a dull slow-jog of a thriller thats less whodunit than why bother. Sure the lush Puerto Rico setting (subbing for Costa Rica) is inviting and the Latin-inspired soundtrack is seductive but thats not enough to make up for this flat uninspired crime story.Timberlake is Richie Furst an ambitious Princeton student who acts as an agent for an online gambling operation convincing other students to sign up. Furst a former Wall Street whiz whose fortune was destroyed in the 2008 financial collapse needs the income from the site to pay his tuition.The Princeton dean (Bob Gunton) isnt too happy about this taking place in his hallowed halls and orders Furst to log off immediately and forever. Furst then goes for one last score hoping to raise enough money to cover his tuition in a long night of binge poker.He loses everything but in such a way that he figures its more than luck or skill to blame. He has been cheated by the operation he used to shill for and hes determined to fly to Central America to confront the mysterious mogul who runs the site Ivan Block (Affleck).Blocks got it all the women (including Gemma Arterton Hansel amp; Gretel Witch Hunters) the house the boat the stubble. And hes apologetic about what happened to Furst to the point of extending him a job offer. Come work for him and put those computer and card skills to good use and make big bank in the process.Before you can say ""if it sounds too good to be true..."" Furst is on the payroll. But then things start happening -- being kidnapped by the FBI getting beat up on the streets of San Jose a friend disappearing. That gets Furst thinking two things Maybe Block is not such a stand-up guy and he has some nasty enemies. With Fursts rose-colored glasses smashed the movie becomes Team Justin vs. Team Ben.All of this makes Runner Runner sound more exciting than it is. Directed by Brad Furman ( The Lincoln Lawyer) and written by the team of Brian Koppelman and David Levien ( Oceans 13 The Girlfriend Experience) Runner Runner plods from one plot point to the next until its dull end. Theres no tension suspense or even one impressive action scene.Affleck fares the best -- he plays the obnoxious cad pretty well -- and gets a couple of the best lines. But the appeal to Timberlake is unknown; youd think after the 2011 misfire In Time hed at least read the script before saying yes.Guys next time you want a trip to Latin America just use Expedia. You can afford it. Cary Darling 817 390-7517; Twitter carydar Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

More about Runner Runner >> Justin Timberlake with his boyish timbre and eyes like lakes is Richie Furst a Princeton grad student in trouble with the dean for running an online gambling operation (hey those tuition costs). Pretty darn certain that hes been the victim of a swindle Richie heads for Costa Rica where Ivan Block (Ben Affleck broad-shouldering his way through the villainy) runs Midnight Black a hugely lucrative Internet operation. Richie confronts Ivan with spreadsheets and algorithms. Ivan is impressed and offers him a job. Gemma Arterton deploying her best decolletage is impressed too impressing herself on Richie when Ivan her boss - and lover - isnt looking. OK maybe hes looking and maybe Artertons oh-so-sophisticated Rebecca is in cahoots with him. Or maybe not. Meanwhile an FBI guy with dubious jurisdiction - thatd be Anthony Mackie - tries to get Richie to go undercover to expose Block and his 30 billion-a-year gambling scam. Throw in some mind-numbing poker-speak (""runner-runner flush in a hand of Texas Hold Em"" anyone?) and various goons thugs hookers corrupt Costa Rican government officials and a pool of hungry crocodiles and you have . . . a mess. Director Brad Furman (The Lincoln Lawyer) working with a templated screenplay and sun-splashed Puerto Rican scenery (subbing for Costa Rica) is among the guilty parties. His movies requisite love clinch between Timberlake and Arterton is a blink-and-you-miss-it montage of cheekbone and shadowy palm fronds torpedoed by a total lack of passion and panache. Affleck gets one Pacino-esque bad guy speech and gets to occupy space in fancy spas and fancy villas as he tries to project an air of sinister charm. His fancy yacht is called the House because as he explains to Timberlake ""the house always wins.""

"Runner Runner not thrilling thrilling review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesRunner Runner not thrilling thrilling reviewRunner Runner is a disappointing thriller about a young man trapped in the world of on-line gambling with a predictable plot and a dearth of suspense. By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentThu. Oct. 3 2013Runner RunnerStarring Justin Timberlake Ben Affleck. Directed by Brad Furman. Opens Oct. 4 at major theatres. 91 minutes. 14A.For a film that focuses on the seamy world of gambling Runner Runner is surprisingly risk-averse.It is oxymoronically a thriller that fails to live up to the genre playing it safe from start to finish with an insipid hero a pedestrian plot and a conclusion that is as predictable as the phases of the moon.Article Continued BelowLets start with Justin Timberlake as our protagonist Richie Furst a graduate teaching assistant at Princeton who gets scammed of his tuition by a poker website and heads to Costa Rica with proof to buttonhole its billionaire owner Ivan Block (played by Ben Affleck).Timberlake is a singer-songwriter with a growing body of work as an actor. And while hes got a likeable stage and screen presence he is very nearly a cipher in the role of Furst. Its difficult to empathize with a character that dumps higher education for the easy money by joining Blocks off-shore gambling empire and then uses blackmail to trap a man Block insists must be brought on board.Affleck fares better as the ruthless Block though he seems to pull his punches in fleshing out a character were supposed to fear and despise. The dialogue hes given by scriptwriters Brian Koppleman and David Levien bespeaks of pontification and a well-fed Napoleon complex. Exiled from the U.S. because of his illegal activities his homesickness feels oddly out of place with his character.Talented British actress Gemma Arteron plays Rebecca the third side of the triangle but the chemistry between her and Furst is negligible. A short scene in which the two are dancing -- shot from the waist up -- is a missed opportunity for the former N Sync member to bust some moves and to show the couples growing physical attraction. Arterons semi-glazed gaze throughout the film seems to say ""The moneys good but I wish I were in a better movie.""John Heard in a brief role as Richies loser father Harry -- used as a pawn by Block to squeeze his son -- looks every inch an inveterate gambler a physical wreck whos spent his life in smoky backrooms drawing busted flushes. To Heards credit hes the most convincing member of the cast.The script is filled with poker terminology that the vast majority of the audience is not going to understand starting with the obscure title. Its also littered with hammy voice-overs -- Fursts opening words ""Everyone gambles"" and trite dialogue. To wit why does Block call his luxury yacht The House? Because ""the house always wins."" Groan. (So does that make it a houseboat?)Its also both sloppy -- as in implausible -- and overly complicated. Are we supposed to be additionally outraged when we learn towards the end of the film that Blocks billion-dollar empire is built on a Ponzi scheme?Saddled with such a lame script director Brad Furman fails to generate much in the way of requisite suspense. A lot of the secondary characters -- who should be important contributors to the plot -- are poorly fleshed out and barely memorable.There are plenty of F-bombs but even the violence seems oddly restrained. A scene in which Furst is beaten up is tame to a fault seeming almost deferential to Timberlakes star power. Another scene in which two men are covered in chicken fat and fed to crocodiles barely causes the pulse to flutter.Runner Runner isnt a terrible film its merely tepid entertainment like a visit to a casino that starts out with high expectations and ends with disappointment and empty pockets.Read more about Justin TimberlakeThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday October 3 2013 1248 PM Title Runner Runner Film Info R Language sexuality violence. Area theaters. Be aware poker fans. ""Runner Runner"" is bluffing. Though this would-be high-tension drama purports to be about the high-stakes world of online gambling that canard is discarded early on for a standard plot involving a naive guy mentored in shiftiness by a charismatic criminal. As a way to seem genuine a banal voiceover simply throws around phrases like ""You gotta go all-in or cash out"" In terms of catching even a bit of the allure of the game ""Rounders"" is still the movie to beat. As for the dull ""Runner"" it folds fast but still takes forever to leave the table. Bright Princeton college student Richie (Justin Timberlake) gambles away whatever tuition money he has by playing on a notorious poker website. Hes sure he was hustled so he heads to a poker expo in Costa Rica to confront the sites enigmatic owner Ivan Block (Ben Affleck). Online poker player Richie (Justin Timberlake) heads to Costa Rica to confront the websites boss -- and meets Rebecca (Gemma Arterton). Impressed by Richies chutzpah -- and worried that rumors of cheating could sink his empire -- Block takes the kid under his wing. He sees something in Richies eyes that reminds Block of himself. Soon Richie is the casino pit boss bookkeeper and errand boy hanging out on Blocks boat and putting the moves on his boss former flame/business partner. Shes played by supersexy Gemma Arterton who lights up the room whenever shes onscreen. But of course Block has cards hes not showing. They involve plans to move operations to Antigua and hang Richie out to dry with a U.S. federal agent (underused Anthony Mackie) and greedy local officials. This is all played as if its never been seen before and gets tiresome fast. Timberlakes genial presence wears thin though Affleck picks up the slack. The actor-director who made last years Oscar-winning ""Argo"" uses his boxy heft and big-brother buddiness to make Ivan an interestingly charming bastard. He still may be an off-choice for Batman but he can at least play a bad man. Richie (Justin Timberlake) gets close to his new boss former love (Gemma Arterton) in ""Runner Runner."" The rest of director Brad Furmans movie rushes around to seem urgent while the script by ""Rounders"" writers Brian Koppleman and David Levien falls flat in the suspense and grit departments. The movie never even explains for laymen the meaning of the title -- its a poker phrase in which a successful draw requires two cards to hit big. This is the kind of movie that in order to puff itself up quotes Meyer Lansky Napoleon and Native American sayings. But according to Hoyle -- as poker players would say -- the film really just does boilerplate Hollywood drama. jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Tackling a subject rarely seen on the big screen online gambling and relying solely on an audiences goodwill for the aforementioned fellows ""Runner Runner"" doesnt ever really attempt a plot. But give this mindless enterprise a little credit because it knows what it does have to offer scantily clad women corrupt officials boats and beaches. Oh and JT plus the next Batman. If thats not enough for you if that doesnt sound at all attractive well then youre going to be pretty disappointed. Because thats it the whole enchilada nothing more to see here. Justin Timberlake as Richie Furst (which but they way is a ridiculous name. Furst?) is a Princeton student going for his masters degree in finance. Weve all been there. Naturally hes a brilliant kid and hes earning a little money on the side by referring college kids (and professors) to gambling websites. For each one he gets hooked on online poker he gets a commission a fairly common affiliate method amongst those always on the lookout for fresh young fools. However when Princetons Dean gets wind of Richies exploits hes none too happy and he tells Furst that this will be his last warning. With no way to pay for school Richie decides to gamble for his college tuition only something goes terribly wrong. This calamity (which remarkably occurred in real life) leads Richie to Costa Rica to meet the big boss of the online poker world Ivan Block (Ben Affleck). From then our young hero will become deeply entangled in the other side of the game he was playing from thousands of miles away given a front row seat to the massive amounts of commerce and shady dealings that come along with offshore illegalities. Its right about here that the story gets supremely fun and also massively disjointed and illogical. ""Runner Runner"" from the writers who brought you ""Rounders"" lacks the intimacy that youd hope for in a tale that purports to be about Fursts journey into the dark underbelly of gambling. Furst makes friends in Costa Rica sure but they are of the vague and underdeveloped sort. He has a love interest yes but its not entirely clear at any given time whether or not either party is actually interested. It would seem as though ""Runner Runner"" wants to live in a world where triple and quintuple crosses exist only it never sets any of them up and so the ""twists"" end up feeling more like ""moments that happen"" instead. So thats odd. Perhaps in a world where ""Runner Runner"" had two hours to toy with (plus one or two less tonal pivots) it could have been a legitimately great film. Instead were left with the trappings of one with mere opulence substituted for substance. Enter Gemma Arterton as Rebecca Ivan Blocks business partner and former fling she finds herself smitten with young Richie. In the grand tradition of most gambling films shes reduced to little more than a woman with a nice figure and some sizzling one-liners (conversely the aforementioned ""Rounders"" featured an interesting female character Famke Janssens portrayal of Petra but theres nothing approaching anything that nuanced here). Also add into the mix Anthony Mackie as FBI Agent Eric Shavers hes trying to put the squeeze on Richie to turn against his mentor Ivan. All of these disparate motivations are thrown into what can only be called a ""plot stew"" with director Brad Furman (""The Lincoln Lawyer"") hoping and praying everything will end up okay if he just keeps stirring. Some of this freneticism pays off with speed and momentum the shiny objects of cinema generally keeping any given audience member from getting too bored. Still by the end of this very short engagement theres more than a little forced tension on display. Timberlake does his best to play a man without a country wary of any and all but no one would truly be able to execute the schizophrenic nature of this character who oftentimes seems to be acting in scenes that arent actually of this film playing against people who are shadows with the backdrop of something picturesque right behind all of them blurry and out of focus. Its not so much that ""Runner Runner"" is bad as it is unconsidered visceral but inscrutable. By the ""grand finale"" its hard to gin up much enthusiasm mostly because theres simply no way to tell whats going on. ""Listen up"" you can almost hear ""Runner Runner"" saying but theres too much empty seashell noise accompanying the command drowning out the order. SCORE 5.8 / 10 Laremy wrote the book on film criticism and isnt very good at gambling.

Hes so much fun to watch as a duplicitous internet-gambling mogul that its almost worth slogging through all the sluggish and predictable scenes in which he does not appear. Almost. Its a story the movies never tire of telling young hungry naive go-getter falls under the spell of a charming mentor only to learn too late that the mentor is using his protege as a patsy while the law breathes down both their necks. ""Runner Runner"" is basically ""Paranoia"" redux only with a higher SPF. See video Ben Affleck Addresses Batman Casting Backlash on Jimmy Fallon Show I Handle S%t Richie (Justin Timberlake) made a mess of things on Wall Street -- according to one or two lines of vague exposition -- and now hes pursuing a masters degree in finance at Princeton. The high cost of tuition has him recruiting fellow students to online gambling sites and when the dean tells him to knock it off Richie wagers and loses his entire stake on virtual poker. A campus computer expert tells Richie that he lost against astronomical odds -- and hearing Timberlake try to speak Math gives ""Runner Runner"" some of its many unintentional laughs -- so Richie takes his case to the source website owner Ivan Block (Affleck) who operates out of Costa Rica since his shenanigans would lead to his arrest were he ever to set foot on U.S. soil. Also read Why Doesnt Justin Timberlake Hit Higher Notes at the Box Office? Block apologizes and offers Richie a refund but Richie takes the magnates alternate offer to come to work for him. Its all fast cars and bikini babes at first but Richie eventually realizes with the help of Blocks ex Rebecca (Gemma Arterton) that Blocks Costa Rican empire is slowly crumbling and that Richie is being set up to take the fall. ""Runner Runner"" is an R-rated movie with the failure of nerve of a PG-13 slasher flick; theres the constant promise of real danger but whenever someone crosses Block theyre more likely to be beaten up than killed. (Even a schmaltz-covered government official gets scooped out of a river before being devoured by crocodiles.) As the plot grinds toward the climax the intended suspense never surfaces; the material is so utterly familiar that youll see every twist coming. Scripters Brian Koppelman and David Levien generate a lot of tin-eared dialogue (for instance Richies opening narration includes the gem ""At Princeton youre either bred for it or you bleed for it"") and the miscasting of Timberlake makes the writing seem even worse. Also read Ben Afflecks Batman Casting Backlash Tweets Petitions Even a Mass Suicide Event on Facebook The singer has proven himself to be a competent actor in films both great (""The Social Network"") and silly (""In Time"") but here his eyes dart about and his voice comes out through his nose and he never conveys the slightest bit of comfort with the material. Arterton is bronzed dressed and lit like a sex doll and terrific character actors like Anthony Mackie and John Heard are saddled with by-the-numbers roles as (respectively) an FBI agent and Richies deadbeat dad. Which leaves us with Affleck who swans through the movie as though it were any good at all making his every scene feel funny and dangerous at the same time. His sinister snark scores while Timberlakes mewling earnestness grinds ""Runner Runner"" to a halt over and over again. Timberlake may be the musician but when it comes to movie acting Affleck proves that sometimes its the singer and not the song that matters most. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Debut feature ""The Take"" boasted a key supporting part from recent Emmy winner Bobby Cannavale. And now with ""Runner Runner"" Furman snags Justin Timberlake in an intermission between blockbuster album releases and Ben Affleck between directing an Oscar-winning film and beginning his term at Wayne Manor. Yet despite his stacked deck of a cast ""Runner Runner"" adds up to little more than a charmless paint-by-numbers thriller unlikely to escape the forces of ""Gravity"" in its early October release.This story first appeared in the October 01 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. Starring as a Princeton grad student of indeterminate age Timberlake plays Richie Furst a former Wall Street striver whose young career was derailed by the 2008 meltdown. Attempting to pay tuition by hustling fellow students for an online poker company Richies extracurriculars are quickly quashed by Princetons crusty old dean which leaves the young man forced to wager his lifes savings on a round of digital Texas Hold Em to stay in school. ""I cant let short-term variance slow me down"" Richie pledges in a representative example of the films stilted voiceover dialogue yet despite his gamblers-son credentials and immense mathematical intelligence (as were frequently told yet never shown) hes taken for all hes worth through circumstances that a buddy statistician tells him are about as probable as winning the lottery four times in a row. Bearing evidence of this cheating Richie heads off to Costa Rica to confront the poker companys jet-setting CEO Ivan Block (Affleck) whos been running his empire from abroad. As absurd coincidence would have it Richie happens to arrive in San Jose on the same weekend as a bacchanalian annual gamblers convention and he takes his case to the highest level. Impressed with Richies moxie Block offers him a job. Like ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" ""Runner Runner"" displays a wealth of show-offy camera techniques that are never quite narratively necessary but Furman does well to stage Richies giddy ascent into the upper echelons of the third-world nouveau riche replete with stacks of cash flashy cars top-shelf liquor (though Richie prefers Bud Light with whom Timberlake coincidentally has a sponsorship deal) and fancy dames none fancier than Blocks main squeeze Rebecca (Gemma Arterton). Piece by piece however Richie begins to suspect his boss may not be an entirely legitimate businessman. His first clue comes when Block approvingly cites Meyer Lansky as an ethical exemplar. His second comes when he watches a cackling Block feed chicken carcasses to the pet crocodiles in his backyard. And all doubts would seem to have been erased when an FBI agent (Anthony Mackie) accosts Richie to enlist his help in Blocks imminent criminal takedown. But the film still has nearly an hour left so Richie dutifully heads back into his mentors questionable embrace. The proscribed character arc here seems to be the slow process by which greed and accumulated compromises allow innocents to work their way deeper into the heart of corruption but for all his supposed genius Richie ultimately registers as a rather dim bulb continually flailing at the obvious lifelines the script keeps throwing him. At long last he decides to strike back yet his climactic master plan -- teased for the last half-hour through mysterious meetings and payoffs -- is forehead-slappingly elementary. ""Its the gambling business in Costa Rica -- occasionally you get punched in the face"" Block quips with shrugged shoulders after Richie has been savagely beaten on his account in one of several moments where Affleck threatens to make this whole film worthwhile. In spite of the mostly undeserved flack he gets for his acting chops its hard to think of a better thesp than Affleck to play a deliciously despicable douchebag and his performance here ranks alongside ""Boiler Room"" and ""Mallrats"" in that regard. At times one detects a certain eye-rolling impatience with the material as he races distractedly through a few of his master-of-the-universe monologues yet thats precisely what the character requires and ""Runner Runners"" appeal increases dramatically whenever Affleck enters the frame. As for Timberlake hes an entirely competent actor yet his cinematic charisma seems best exploited by supporting parts at this point in his career and hes never totally believable as a babe-in-the-woods whizkid. It doesnt help that he and Arterton have all the onscreen heat of a bowl of soggy cornflakes and seem to be thrust together for no reason other than the fact that theyre the two most attractive people in any particular room. Puerto Rico ably stands in for Costa Rica throughout (considering every Costa Rican depicted here is either a prostitute or an authority figure accepting a bribe it seems unlikely the country would have signed on) though cinematographer Mauro Fiore never quite renders the natural beauty of the surroundings as luminously as one would expect.

TWITTER Justin Timberlake and Ben Affleck star in Foxs gambling pic out on Oct. 4 in the U.S. A story like that at the heart of Runner Runner about a young American gambler who gets sucked way above his head into the criminal doings of a big-time offshore operator would have found its ideal life as a tough punchy black-and-white programmer back in the 1950s. Today it would have been most viable as a grandiose character study done on an operatic scale by a filmmaker like Martin Scorsese or Michael Mann. Whats actually up onscreen in this vaguely ambitious but tawdry melodrama falls into an in-between no-mans-land that endows it with no distinction whatsoever a work lacking both style and insight into the netherworld it seeks to reveal. Despite an intriguing set-up and Ben Affleck and Justin Timberlake heading the cast this Fox release holds a losing box-office hand. PHOTOS 25 of Falls Most Anticipated Movies Enders Game Catching Fire The Wolf of Wall Street and More The opening of the script by Brian Koppelman and David Levien (Solitary Man The Girlfriend Experience Oceans 13) combines with Timberlakes presence to suggest a somewhat less exceptional variation on The Social Networks focus on maverick entrepreneurialism in the Ivy League. Threatened with expulsion from Princeton unless he shuts down his online gambling site finance grad student Richie Furst (Timberlake) with nothing now to lose heads for Costa Rica determined to stick it to the undisputed king of computer gambling Ivan Black (Affleck). Arriving during the bosss annual blowout the Midnight Black Expo Richie cleverly scores an audience with the bodyguard-festooned Ivan. Lounging on his heros yacht Richie brazenly accuses his relaxed host of cheating him on his site ... and Ivan readily admits it. In the films best-written scene the older man affably agrees to reimburse the kid for his losses and then some. But then again Ivan can always use a smart ballsy guy in his operation so maybe Richie would like to come work for him. Seven maybe even eight figures a year beckon. With Puerto Rican locations doubling for Costa Rica the allure of Ivans world looks pretty tacky no matter how doused in money it is. With the help of a couple of other Yankee college boys who are given no character dimension whatsoever Richie quickly learns the ropes and gets mixed signals from Ivans glamorous factotum Rebecca (Gemma Arterton) who may or may not be on exclusive reserve for the boss. All goes swimmingly until a third of the way in Richie is kidnapped  by none other than the FBI whose local agent Shavers (Anthony Mackie) tries to coerce the kid into informing on Ivans business. PHOTOS From George Clooney to Justin Timberlake Celebrities With Tequila Labels When Richie tells his boss what happened Ivan waves it off claiming it happens to everyone who works for him. But Ivan has a little unpleasantness of his own in store for his eager acolyte as he forces him to blackmail a top client into a continued business relationship then starts using him as a bagman to pay off local authorities who are becoming rather less enchanted with this foreigner whos introducing an unwanted criminal element into their society. The overriding problem with the direction by Brad Furman (The Lincoln Lawyer The Take) is that it lacks a real pulse a throb of excitement that pulls you into this unsavory world and will accept no resistance. Furman stuffs the screen with luxurious digs fancy cars cool boats private jets and parties loaded with scantily clad women but theres no undercurrent no intoxicating hook used to snare the audience along with Richie for the ride. Beyond that the dramas final stretch in which Richie must desperately try to turn the tables on his boss if he has a chance of escaping with his hide intact charts arcane financial and strategic moves in such a rapid and superficial way that its impossible to know how in any semblance of a real world he can pull this off in almost no time at all. To whatever marginal extent one might be invested in the film up to this point the impulse is to just throw in the towel at this point. Theres quite a bit of rough stuff between the Americans and an assortment of pissed off local thugs with various grievances and the credibility problem is further compounded by the integral role Rebecca plays in this final act even though nothing thats gone on between this one-dimensional character and Richie up to this point justifies her behavior in the late-going. Shes an impossible-to-read character. Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the seven producers here and might have once imagined himself playing Afflecks character but its Timberlake who rather resembles a younger more lightweight version of DiCaprio in his appearance as Richie. The son of a washed-up professional gambler (John Heard) Richie is positioned as a potential golden boy a smarty-pants who nonetheless cant detect the sticky web hes caught in until its too late. Physically Timberlake cuts the right profile but theres not a trace of anything going on beneath the surface. The most entertaining casting of the automatically charismatic Ivan role would have been an actor expert at thoroughly seductive snake-oil salesmen Jack Nicholson in his prime. Affleck cant help but come across as virtually the opposite a highly affable sort but he cleverly twists this trait to his advantage in making his crime kingpin a basically really nice guy who as Mick Jagger puts it in Performance can also ""shove his knife.""
