Columbia Pictures hide caption toggle caption Columbia Pictures The premise of the new movie Stranger Than Fiction sounds perfect for comedian Will Farrell. He plays a man who discovers that hes a character in a novel and that his every action is controlled by the novels author. But what sounds like a knockabout comic premise turns out to have some interesting nuances. Harold Crick is the most boring guy you can imagine. A tax auditor for the IRS he has no life not even a fantasy life which makes it strange when he starts to hear a voice. Its an omnicient female narrator (Emma Thompson) with a British accent talking about HIM as he does the things he usually does... like brushing his teeth. The voice-of-God thing gets disconcerting enough after a few days that Harold decides to get outside help. Since his problem is a narrator he goes to a literary critic -- played by Dustin Hoffman -- who asks him a series of questions to determine what kind of a story the narrator is telling. The critic figures that by a process of elimination he can figure out whats likely to happen to Harold but its a slow process and Harold may not have a lot of time. The reason Harold is so upset is that everything the narrator has SAID would happen has actually happened. And while writers block seems to have his author stymied for the moment he can hardly count on that staying the case. The slapstick possibilities are obviously especially with Farrell playing Harold and Thompson playing a semi-suicidal author with Queen Latifah as her assistant. But the actors and the filmmakers all take a more restrained approach than you might expect keeping the humor gentle and the jokes mostly as literary as the premise. When Harold gets involved with a lovely young baker played by Maggie Gyllenhall for instance he brings her flours -- not the kind with blossoms the kind she can bake with. A nice conceit. Most of the storytelling is equally sharp. Characters are defined by the spaces they occupy and story elements blend with existential logic. Its executed so cleverly in fact that until the last five minutes it may not even occur to you that a movie about an author who has trouble with endings is likely to have trouble with an ending of its own. And so it does. But Stranger Than Fiction also has the wit to comment on that development too.

Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Stranger Than Fiction"" with Will Ferrell Maggie Gyllenhaal Dustin Hoffman Emma Thompson Queen Latifah. Directed by Marc Forster from a screenplay by Zach Helm. 105 minutes. Rated PG-13 for some disturbing images sexuality brief language and nudity. Several theaters. Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) is an IRS agent whose favorite word is ""integer"" and whose apartment is as bare and lifeless as a hotel room. His life is a model of buttoned-down sameness until one day he hears a voice in his head. Its female British-accented and briskly ironic and its narrating his life. ""Its telling me what Ive already done. Accurately and with a better vocabulary"" he tells a shrink with understandable agitation. (Because the voice is Emma Thompsons the effect on the audience is even more unnerving; its as if the poor fellows life is suddenly being dictated by Elinor Dashwood or Nanny McPhee.) Thus begins the enticing inside-out world of ""Stranger Than Fiction"" which poses an irresistible question What do you do when you suddenly realize that youre a fictional character created by a novelist (played with neurotic nuance by Thompson) who may well wish to kill you off? First-time screenwriter Zach Helm dancing in the footsteps of Charlie Kaufman (""Adaptation"") has crafted a comedy both funny and cerebral wickedly smart and yet warmhearted. And director Marc Forster whose career reads like a zigzag tour through genres (""Monsters Ball"" ""Finding Neverland"") finds an agreeable groove letting the storys essential sweetness shine through. This is a movie that feels written not assembled; its voice is distinctive and you never know quite where its going. That said ""Stranger than Fiction"" isnt for everyone; it requires (like Kaufmans screenplays) a fair bit of concentration as its many layers are revealed and a tolerance for the kind of high concept that some call whimsy and some call contrivance. But the films saving grace is its soft center like the cookies baked by pastry chef Ana (a warmly flirtatious Maggie Gyllenhaal) that raise Harolds spirits. Near the end the narrator describes how some ""things we love and need"" like cookies and hugs and guitars and fiction give our lives grace; its a genuinely touching passage bringing us into the movie and sweeping it into a different generous realm. Just as ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" did for Jim Carrey ""Stranger Than Fiction"" reveals the quiet side of Will Ferrell As Harold he keeps his face carefully still resisting every opportunity for mugging. As his plight is gradually revealed he becomes increasingly animated seeking the help of a literature professor (Dustin Hoffman) and falling unexpectedly for the winsome Ana. It would seem an actors nightmare to have ones every move narrated by Thompson (the performance needs to live up to the voice-over and the voice-over is very entertaining indeed) but Ferrell pulls it off. In his good-boy red sweater -- often the only touch of vivid color on the screen -- hes an oddball hero and you root for him. The films minimalist design with unbreakingly gray IRS offices and near-empty rooms keep the focus where it belongs on the words. ""Stranger Than Fiction"" is both about a novel and like a novel; you eagerly await the turning of the pages.

Starring Will Ferrell Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman. Directed by Marc Foster. (PG-13. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The thing to delight in about ""Stranger Than Fiction"" is its cant-miss premise A man hears a voice narrating his every action and comes to realize that hes a character in some unseen authors novel. But the thing to admire about it is its follow-through It doesnt coast on its premise but follows where it leads which is into some serious territory. What might have been a joke with a tagged-on sentimental ending becomes instead a sensitive movie that affirms the value of life. [Podcast Mick LaSalle talks ""Stranger Than Fiction.""] The first hint that ""Stranger Than Fiction"" is going to be more than just a laugh machine comes when we meet the novelist and narrator. Played by Emma Thompson in uncompromising terms Kay is an unpleasant self-destructive wreck stuck in a living hell of writers block. Her living space is spare just the bare necessities plus an electric typewriter and she looks as if she could use a shower. Thompson doesnt play her as a caricature of a writer but as a writer possessed and oppressed by the struggle to finish her book. The honesty of Thompsons performance its pursuit of quirky disturbing truths over soft cliches is typical of the entire movie. In the films fantasy construct mild-mannered IRS manager Harold Crick -- played by Will Ferrell in a departure from his usual straight comic roles -- is not someone invented by the novelist. He has an independent existence and lives in the same world that she does. Nonetheless she seems to have control over his fate in that whatever she writes about him happens immediately. He is unaware of this until one morning brushing his teeth he hears her voice in his head -- the voice of Thompson at her most poised and supercilious -- describing his every action interaction and thought. The voice is so present that he cant believe no one else can hear it. The spectacle of Ferrell reacting with anxiety and frustration at hearing his life narrated makes for many good comic moments -- not the least of which is when the narrator mentions in passing Harolds ""imminent death"" and he becomes frantic. At the same time screenwriter Zach Helm finds a way to keep the narration from suffocating the movie Harold hears the narration only intermittently for a few hours each day when Kay is writing. Most of the movie is like a comic variation on ""D.O.A."" the old film noir in which a man fatally poisoned but not dead yet goes on a frantic search for the person who murdered him. Here the man is just as frantic to find the author but his symptoms suggest schizophrenia. The only one who will humor him at all is a literary theorist played with skewed wit by Dustin Hoffman who helps Harold figure out what genre of story hes living in. The possibility of a romance with a politically radical baker (Maggie Gyllenhaal) lends hope that his life might turn out to be a romantic comedy but tragedy may be around the next corner. In a film that easily could have been cold or ironical Ferrell provides the emotional thrust. There becomes something surprisingly poignant about witnessing the process of a regimented personality -- solitary in his life obsessive-compulsive in his routines -- opening himself up to direct experience. Director Marc Foster keeps the tone out of the realm of schmaltz and guides Ferrell to a credible effective performance. If theres a point to ""Stranger Than Fiction"" except as a divertissement its open to discussion. It can be seen as a caustic commentary on the artistic personality. It can be seen as a celebration of the power of art to transform lives. It can be seen as a story about how characters can educate their creators or as a metaphor for the human condition. Take your pick but one thing is clear Its too good not to be regarded as something. Its not the deepest piece of work but its hardly frivolous and it connects with us because theres something about it we inevitably recognize as real. -- Advisory This film contains sexuality and brief profanity.

An inner voice torments a glum tax man (Will Ferrell) in Stranger Than Fiction. Photo Sony Pictures Stranger Than Fiction 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The strangest thing about Stranger Than Fiction is how muted it is how matter-of-fact it sounds how logically everyone behaves. Strange? Surely not. It all seems perfectly normal. Once you get past the surrealistic whopper of a premise -- man hears author narrating his life -- the story unfurls in the gentlest of ways. No one arrests him for acting bizarrely. No one carts him off to the hospital. When Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) explains to a shrink (Linda Hunt briefly) that a woman is holding forth inside his cranium she suggests that he go on meds. But he resists. Quietly. (""No its not schizophrenia. Its a voice in my head."") She backs down. Calmly. He asks her for a moment to assume the narration is real and for a moment she complies. Against all psychiatric precedent she refers him to a literature professor (Dustin Hoffman) who eliminates likely protagonists (Harold isnt Hamlet Miss Marple or a golem) and debates whether hes stuck inside a comedy or a tragedy. ""Tragedy you die comedy you get hitched"" he explains all blunt academic detachment. Like chatting with a fictional character is no big thang. It is however for Harold who begins to fear a tragic end when his third-person omniscient narrator foreshadows ""imminent death."" Harolds efforts to forestall this denouement involve some poker-faced literary comedy a bit of subdued melodrama and one bittersweet romantic entanglement with a crusty baker all of it spun together in a gossamer web of soft-spoken absurdity. Directed by Marc Forster (Stay Finding Neverland) from a script by first-timer Zach Helm Stranger Than Fiction is lovely and erudite epigrammatic and slow -- and not at all the kooky Ferrell vehicle you might be led to expect. Ferrell isnt kooky and its not his vehicle; he muffles himself utterly as Harold a glum tax auditor who wears his clothes and his corporate melancholy like Gregory Pecks 50 years ago in The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit. The whole cast impresses without showing off Hoffman as the droll and misanthropic prof; Maggie Gyllenhaal (can she do no wrong?) as the gooey-inside baker whos being audited by Harold; Queen Latifah regal as ever in a small supporting part as a publishers aide. The flashiest role belongs to Emma Thompson as Kay Eiffel Harolds author narrator and godlike arbiter of fate who battles writers block by envisioning her hero in various fatal scenarios. She imagines a leap off a building a plunge into water in a crash. And while she imagines she chain-smokes through her own lonely oblivion hair mussed clothes baggy pink-rimmed eyes exhausted and sad from her perch on the ivory tower. (""Eiffel"" Coincidence?) Yet even here Forsters reticence -- and Thompsons spiny humanity -- rescue this small unlikely affair from madcap trickery or histrionics. Its too hushed a film for overstatement of any kind whether comic or tragic. And when it ends it climaxes not with the speculative ""gotcha"" of Stay -- not with the tearful whimsy of Finding Neverland -- but with a tranquil revelation thats true to the movies low-key characters and delicately erected plot. Stranger Than Fiction might be film but it moves like a novel a literate unhurried tale marked by softly wrought reflections on the self-made life. Harold the protagonist in someone elses story struggles to star in his own. But its a quiet struggle. A calm one. And its not so strange at all. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals GameStop Summer Sale Banana Republic Final Cut Sale Up to 75% off + free shipping...

Played with wounded-animal insight by Emma Thompson Eiffel sucks the butts down spits into a tissue then wraps them and puts them away. Her cigs might say that this nerve-jangled writer of books in which she ends her heros life is not a litterbug. Only in director Marc Forsters magnanimous delight ""Stranger Than Fiction"" Eiffel is not a character. Shes an author coming to the end of her long-delayed novel in which IRS auditor Harold Crick dies. Will Ferrell delivers a moving and surprisingly delicate - though not so surprisingly funny - turn as the lonesome bureaucrat bedeviled by a voice only he hears. In screenwriter Zach Helms marvelous debut objects are aware. They can be our allies. They bear witness. They might even alter our fates. And it is Harolds wristwatch says Eiffel with her plush persistent narration that ""changed everything..."" . When Harold hears about his imminent demise he goes from flummoxed to frightened to desperate. If you dont love this anquished soul as he demolishes his monks cell of an apartment after hearing Eiffel read his death sentence then your ticker is as paltry as the Grinchs. As characters facing their end often do in literature - and ""Stranger Than Fiction"" is literary in a vital way - Harold starts to embrace living. Maggie Gyllenhaal plays Ana Pascal. The tattooed defiant owner of a succesful bakery shes the subject of Harolds audit and then his affections. This being a fable about stories and our place in them he also seeks out his maker to ask why he must die and to plead for mercy. His author is fairly busy with dilemmas of her own. Eiffels publishers have sent in a closer of sorts an assistant named Penny Escher (Queen Latifah). The two can be found in inclement weather and other awkward situations with Penny looking on doubtfully. Eiffel wears a frozen grimace as she imagines ways to off Harold. A blond boy and a black woman figure into each scenario. But in an act of omnipotent empathy she takes his place in those death scenes. Forster directed the edgy ""Monsters Ball"" and the enchanting ""Neverland."" Here he deftly wraps his arms around play and heartache in a loving embrace. Visual wit abounds. Graphics dance across the screen as Eiffels narration recounts Harolds toothbrush strokes his steps from his apartment to the bus stop and so forth. Zest snuggles up to melancholy. Britt Daniel and Brian Reitzells evocative music adds to the dance of tragedy and comedy. Sadness turns into deft humor then circles back to the bittersweet. Ferrells face is remarkable at registering Harolds plaintive awareness of his predicament. Harolds pragmatic nature sends him in search of a resolution. Its his matter-of-fact clarity that makes the scenes between him and a psychiatrist (Linda Hunt) and a touchy-feely workplace therapist (Tom Hulce) so darn amusing. His certainty trumps their theories and interventions. He finally lands at Jules Hilberts university doorstep. Surely the narrative theorist played by Dustin Hoffman will know who is writing the story and what her aim might be. Hoffmans ""little did he know"" riff is pitch-perfect verbal slapstick and a deliciously spot-on depiction of the natterings of some professors. Pascal. Escher. Eiffel. Math geeks will recognize a pattern Everything in this film unfolds to deliver an elegant existential construct. With its twists and meta-turns ""Stranger Than Fiction"" conjures images of ""Adaptation"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" the mind- bending pleasures of writer Charlie Kaufman. Forster is less flashy and just as gifted as Kaufmans directors have been. This PG-13 film is well-wrought - not overwrought - a heartfelt gift offered to the broadest possible audience. There are of course a number of ways to understand this meeting of creator and creation. To borrow Joan Osbornes lyrical conceit ""Stranger Than Fiction"" imagines what might happen if god were one of us just a pajama- clad slob struggling like Karen Eiffel. Toward the conclusion of this magically thoughtful film Ana Pascal utters a wincingly clumsy line. In a film of impressive verbal acuity the line is striking for its tinniness. I wont divulge that bit of dialog but know this ""Stranger Than Fiction"" is so finely tuned that the clunker is yet another one of the movies many arguments for grace found in the ordinary.

"In Fiction his life her novel and our loss - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW In Fiction his life her novel and our loss By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  November 10 2006 In ""Stranger Than Fiction"" Will Ferrell plays Harold Crick  an IRS auditor whose life is a bore. Every day he brushes his teeth using the same number of strokes and gallops across the street at a pace that never varies. He has no friends no ostensible interests and while my hand couldnt reach from my seat to his neck up on screen Id bet Harold doesnt have much of a pulse either.This stultifying greeting card of a movie wants to correct that. One day he hears a pinched British voice and to his annoyance it narrates his every move reveals his every thought and catalog s his many fastidious habits (slick diagrams pop up on screen to reiterate what the narrator tells us).The voice isnt Gods. Its Emma Thompson s and this film marks the first time Ive wished shed shut up. Moping with condescending teenage sullenness Thompson plays Karen Eiffel  a miserably frustrated bestselling author whose novel-in-progress ""Death and Taxes"" happens to star an unwitting Harold. So the picture -- which after all wants to be a comedy -- is divided between two exasperating cliches a joyless tax man and a blocked writer.As the author considers a way to kill off her fictional creation the actual Harold slowly arises from his stupor and dares to take a bite out of life -- or at least the cookies the prickly baker hes auditing (Maggie Gyllenhaal ) forces him to eat. ""Stranger Than Fiction"" aspires to ingenuity but the cosmic tension between Karen and Harolds dueling objectives is underwhelming. Even after he hears her mention his ""imminent death"" Harolds determination to live doesnt wake the movie up. It gets sluggish and simple.While Karen snaps at the assistant (Queen Latifah ) her publisher has sent to ensure her new books completion Harold visits a literature professor (Dustin Hoffman ) who cant begin to counsel or cure him until he determines whether Harold is in a comedy or a tragedy. To that end Harold keeps a running notepad tally. When Gyllenhaals character whom Harold adores doesnt laugh at a joke he chalks one up for tragedy. Needless to say this might be the biggest literary misapprehension since Alanis Morissette s ""Ironic.""Real irony though is out of the reach of screenwriter Zach Helm and director Marc Forster . Instead they strain for the arch surrealist structure and metaphysical curlicues of a Charlie Kaufman picture. (Occasionally the film cuts away to a little boy on a bike and a woman who drives a bus; theyll come in handy for the overwrought climax.) Watching the movie made me long for the big  risky ideas and entertainingly fearless filmmaking in David O. Russells ""I Heart Huckabees "" and Spike Jonzes ""Adaptation "" which Kaufman wrote. Both were similarly conceptual escapades but they let it all hang out.""Stranger Than Fiction"" is uptight. Helm is clearly pro-love and happy endings but hes short on loose fresh ideas. And Forster whose last movie was the unnavigable thriller ""Stay"" is at heart a sentimentalist. Having made both ""Monsters Ball"" and ""Finding Neverland"" he seems to cherish platitudes and Helms script contains a staggering variety. At some point Harold buys a guitar and Karens narration tells us that he ""did that which the unrelenting lyrics of those numerous punk rock songs told him. Harold Crick lived his life.""Will anyone find that as revelatory as the filmmakers do?The casting is so conventional that you can imagine the actors were hired by committee. Only Hoffman really seems to relish his role which is ultimately just a conceit . Still the right people have the wrong parts. Why not let Thompson play the auditor and have Ferrell play Hoffmans part? Hoffman could breathe life and wisdom into Latifahs thankless assistant while she plays the baker and Gyllenhaal plays Karen. If that doesnt make a better movie it at least makes one I havent already seen.Some scenes however no actor can save. Gyllenhaal tells Ferrell she dropped out of Harvard Law because ""if I was going to make the world a better place Id do it with cookies."" By this point the only reason for an audience to remain seated is to discover which letters of the alphabet sponsored the movie.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Its Harolds shy joke -- little bags of specialty flours in lieu of flowers since Ana is a bake-shop proprietress and an ardent baker. (And the subject of an IRS audit.) The encounter draws its charm from its emotional charge and the presence of two genuinely endearing stars. But the joke is little more than a whimsical notion and the scene played out dispassionately is less amusing than self-amused. The same holds true of the films premise. Harold is an auditor in more ways than one. He keeps hearing a womans voice in his head -- the same one we hear as a voice-over narrator. Soon he realizes that hes a character in a novel that the voice belongs to the novelist (whos played by Emma Thompson) and that the novel though still a work in progress will end with his death unless he finds some way to save himself. As notions go this one is intriguing -- its basically about free will -- even if Harold evokes other heroes trapped within invisible surrounds in such movies as ""The Truman Show"" ""The Matrix"" ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" and ""The Purple Rose of Cairo."" But the notion is also arbitrary rather bloodless and seriously lacking in plausibility let alone logic. ENLARGE Sometimes I feel trapped within the invisible surround of movies made by products of the self-esteem movement -- people who as children were told that everything they did was wonderful. This movie seems to be one of them. The director Marc Forster and the writer Zach Helm (in his feature debut) are too enchanted with their inventions to bother with supporting details especially around the storys edges. When Harold seeks help for his surreal problem from Jules Hilbert an English professor played briskly by Dustin Hoffman Hilbert asks few questions betrays no surprise and dispenses advice thats patent nonsense. When the novelist Kay Eiffel finds herself hopelessly blocked the script dispenses a nonsensical device to unblock her -- some sort of publishers emissary played by Queen Latifah whose only dramatic function is auditing Kays stream of neurotic consciousness. (The movies glib approach to making magic was also a hallmark of Mr. Forsters ""Finding Neverland."") All the same ""Stranger Than Fiction"" pulls us along in a state of pleasant expectation. Mr. Forster directs his actors confidently and expertly. The cinematographer Roberto Schaefer and the production designer Kevin Thompson have done their work well -- its nice that Chicago looks abstracted like a melting pot of modern American cities. And that expectation is constantly rewarded by the splendid cast. Emma Thompsons frazzled author grows funnier as the movie goes on though Kay starts from an initial state thats depressed and slightly depressing. Maggie Gyllenhaals magic is the real thing -- a rich expressive voice a demeanor that can switch instantaneously from rueful to incandescent. How could Harold not be terminally smitten when Ana seduces him by reciting the various cookies she used to bake while attending Harvard Law School? Will Ferrell finds all sorts of surprising nuances to relieve Harolds rigidity which finally dissolves in Anas glow. His performance is a model of restraint and then of slow joyful release as when he plays a battered old Fender and sings the Monkees ""Whole Wide World"" in a precarious falsetto. For all of the films narrative intricacies its love in bloom that carries the day. A Good Year ENLARGE Bad Match Russell Crowe in A Good Year. ""This sublime nectar is absolutely incapable of lying"" says Albert Finneys overripe connoisseur in the preface of ""A Good Year."" An ex-pat English wine grower in Haute Provence hes preaching the splendors of the grape to his nephew a precocious little twit who will grow up to be a dislikable London bond trader played by Russell Crowe. This romantic comedy which was directed by Ridley Scott from Marc Kleins adaptation of a Peter Mayle book is incapable of telling an emotional truth. There isnt a milliliter of honest feeling from start to finish and precious little comedy or romance. Mr. Crowes character Max Skinner doesnt lack self-knowledge. ""Im famously callous even to the point of being insensitive"" he tells a beautiful French woman Fanny (Marion Cotillard) after inheriting his late uncles chateau and overgrown vineyard. (Fannys name is a reference to a classic French comedy written by Marcel Pagnol and such is the rampant Pagnolism of this terrible script that someone says of Fanny ""Its rumored that she will let no man near her heart."") One wonders however about Russell Crowes self-knowledge. For reasons of his own he manages to make Max unremittingly dislikable. Whats more Mr. Crowe inflicts on Max and himself a painfully clumsy version of the clownish physical comedy that Cary Grant once did so well. ""A Good Year"" is ""Sideways"" gone sour the dregs of faux Provence. Fur The full title of ""Fur"" is ""Fur An Imaginary Portrait of Diane Arbus."" A more unwieldy though more candid title might have been ""Fur What Happened When a Group of Imaginative People Who Couldnt Get the Rights to Diane Arbuss Photographs Made a Movie About Her Anyway."" No one has the right to say they shouldnt have done it. The production provided work for many people. Nicole Kidman and Robert Downey Jr. have acquitted themselves extremely well within the limits of their roles. And what got done is a curiosity that might have intrigued the late photographer in some perverse way Diane Arbus whose parents were in the fur business had an abiding interest in aberration. But Steven Shainbergs handsome unsettling film is of severely limited use to those who want to understand its subject -- Arbus took her own life in 1971 -- or want to be entertained. The basic concept is simple. When Ms. Kidmans taut repressed Diane visits and then befriends Mr. Downeys mysterious neighbor a befurred apparition out of Cocteaus ""Beauty and the Beast"" she is opening the door to her subconscious a world of prodigious freaks that soon invades the (apartment) house of her consciousness. Theres much more of course including ingenious variations on Arbus photographs by the cinematographer Bill Pope and a visual aesthetic that evokes in addition to Cocteau David Lynch (an Arbus acolyte if ever there was one). ""Fur"" starts stylishly and confidently but the film dwindles down to a chamber piece in a claustrophobic chamber. Enter at your own risk. Come Early Morning Joey Lauren Adams a distinctive actress makes her feature debut as a writer and director with ""Come Early Morning."" Shes not in it. The film set in her native Arkansas stars another distinctive actress Ashley Judd as Lucy a smart self-destructive loner who cant make love to a man unless shes drunk. Much of the action turns on what Lucy will do for herself -- or to herself -- after chancing to meet Mr. Right or at least Mr. Not Wrong (a fine performance by Jeffrey Donovan.) The script is somewhat predictable and the pace is leisurely but Ms. Judd makes Lucys choices seem momentous and Ms. Adams gives us several beautiful scenes. One of them all but wordless in the end involves Lucys urgent attempt to talk to her remote closed-off father who can respond only by playing a plaintive melody on a treasured guitar.    DVD TIP Maggie Gyllenhaal emerged as a full-fledged movie star in ""Secretary"" (2002) a remarkable film directed by Steven Shainberg that sees a sadomasochistic relationship as convincingly a love story.

"Stranger Than Fiction reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Stranger Than Fiction reviewed. Stranger Than Fiction reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 9 2006 538 PM Life and Art Will Ferrells Stranger Than Fiction. By Dana Stevens Will Ferrell in Stranger Than Fiction Stranger Than Fiction (Columbia Pictures) is a maddening contraption a high-concept story so overwrought and overthought that you want to thwack at it like a pinata to get at the sweet romantic comedy inside. This Will Ferrell/Maggie Gyllenhaal love story narrated by Emma Thompson in a hyperself-conscious framing device is the latest entry in what has become a comedy subgenre ersatz Charlie Kaufman. Not that being influenced by the lyrically nutty screenwriter of Being John Malkovich and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a bad thing necessarily. Last summers Click with Adam Sandler as a suburban dad manipulating his life via a remote-control device turned a Kaufman-esque premise into a touching if formulaic comedy. Its just that only Charlie Kaufman can really succeed at something as weird as being Charlie Kaufman (and sometimes as with Adaptation even he cant completely pull it off). Like its hero Harold Crick (Ferrell) Stranger Than Fiction directed by Marc Forster and written by first-time scriptwriter Zach Helm seems to suffer from low self-esteem. Why cant this movie see that it doesnt need a hulking meta-narrative apparatus to make us care about its story? It had us at hello--or would have if not for the excess of high-concept trickery. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Harold Crick is an IRS agent in Chicago. You know who Harold is Hes Walter Mitty C.C. Baxter the man in the gray flannel suit. Hes a straight-arrow company man who counts his toothbrush strokes and turns in at precisely 1113 every night. Harold is so obsessive-compulsive that when he scans a room he sees graphs and charts hovering in the air around him measuring and quantifying everything in sight. But one ordinary Wednesday something strange happens In Harolds head he starts to hear a British female voice that narrates each transcendently boring moment of his life from a third-person limited-omniscient point of view. And that very day of course is when everything stops being boring. Advertisement Auditing Ana Pascal (Gyllenhaal) a leftist baker whos defaulted on her taxes as a form of political protest Harold loses focus as his internal narrator points out that Anas lanky tattooed body is sexy as hell. (I couldnt agree more Gyllenhaal whos ubiquitous on movie screens this year has never looked better.) As he files away manila folders at work the novelist within compares the sound of shuffling paper to the scraping of ocean waves on sand. Driven by this constant nattering inside his skull Harold seeks out a shrink (Linda Hunt) who diagnoses him with schizophrenia. When he refuses treatment she refers him inexplicably to an eccentric literature professor--Dustin Hoffman looser and funnier than ever. Meanwhile the narrator herself emerges as a character in a separate storyline Shes Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson) a reclusive chain-smoking novelist whos stuck on the ending for her latest book. So stuck in fact that her publisher sends in an assistant Penny (Queen Latifah) who promises the tortured writer that shell be available 24/7 to inspire chide and shame her into finishing the novel. (I spaced on the rest of that scene due to a brief daydreaming session spent wondering Has such a service ever been offered in the history of book publishing? And would any writer actually permit it?) Its when we realize that Harold Crick is the protagonist in Karens novel-in-progress that the story-within-a-story structure gets tricky. This is a clever and ambitious premise but one that requires careful execution. Anytime a movie posits a world with its own narrative laws it had better be pretty secure about how those laws work. If Harold is a fictional being who exists only in the universe of Karens book what was his existential status prior to when she began this particular novel? Is he a real person who was born grew up and got a job at the IRS or did he only begin to live when she began to write him? Has Karen always had the ability to create characters who exist outside the work or did it just start with this novel and if so why? At one point Karen agonizes to Penny about her tradition of always killing off the main characters in her books ""Ive written eight novels"" she says. ""Have I committed murder eight times?"" Well has she? The movie never decides. Call me a nitpicker but asking these procedural questions about the scripts internal logic seems key to making sense of the ending. I wont give that away of course but youve probably already gathered that it involves a particularly stark staging of the art-versus-life dilemma. In the films moving middle act Harold decides at Anas urging to become the person hes always wanted to be the hero of his own life. He leaves his bachelor apartment to move in with his sweet nerdy workmate Dave played by Tony Hale (to those of us still in mourning for Arrested Development that would be Buster Bluth without the hook-hand). Harold also buys an electric guitar and tentatively teaches himself to play it culminating in an amateur performance of a punk song thats a shoo-in for this years Best Pop Cover by a Comic Actor (the prize Bill Murray took in 2004 for his karaoke number in Lost in Translation). This role is for Will Ferrell what the lead in Eternal Sunshineof the Spotless Mind was for Jim Carrey a chance to dial back the comic shtick and play a quiet reserved schlemiel who blossoms under the tutelage of a kooky sweetheart. Stranger Than Fiction is no Eternal Sunshine. But if you can look past its clunky attempt to be exactly that theres great pleasure in watching Ferrell like Harold turn into someone you never knew he could be.

"A Novel Idea Runs Away From Its Narrator washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies A Novel Idea Runs Away From Its Narrator Only make believe In ""Stranger Than Fiction"" Will Ferrell and Maggie Gyllenhaal have romantic chemistry but their short story strains to fill an entire book. (By Ralph Nelson -- Columbia Pictures) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday November 10 2006 You could watch ""Stranger Than Fiction"" and enjoy a perfectly fine romance between Will Ferrell and Maggie Gyllenhaal. And why not? Ferrells deer-in-the-headlights anxiety always has us chuckling at hello and Gyllenhaals doe-eyed charm could warm a blueberry muffin at 50 paces. This time around hes a taxman whose obsession with numbers and routine could use a romantic wake-up call and shes a Manhattan bakery owner with no man in her life. The meet-cute part of the equation? Hes auditing her. Aw. But theres a problem This romance isnt developed enough to be truly satisfying -- its like fat-free SnackWells when you want Godiva. So at the risk of subjecting you to a screenwriting tutorial we must point out that this affair is meant to be the subplot . Its not the original story we signed up for -- or thought we did. In case the witness protection program has you living in Vladivostok and you missed the ubiquitous trailer for this movie ""Fiction"" is supposed to be about Harold Crick (thats Ferrell) and the voice he keeps hearing in his head. It belongs to Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson) an English writer who just happens to be writing a novel about a character named . . . Harold Crick. The real Harold doesnt appreciate some dulcet-toned Englishwoman narrating the soundtrack of his life. This is the movies best gimmick that Harold can actually hear Eiffel. She seems deeply aware of his dull personal life and his obsession with numbers and statistics. (White ghostly numbers literally float in front of Harold whenever she starts talking.) Even worse in her final chapter she plans to . . . kill off the character The only thing keeping the real Harold alive apparently is her creative indecision as she figures out how to get rid of him. With its delving -- at least initially -- into Harolds neurotic inner workings ""Stranger Than Fiction"" brings to mind movies such as 2002s ""Adaptation"" and the 2004 ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."" In those films both written by Charlie Kaufman we become intimately acquainted with the quirks and neuroses of the central character. (Screenwriter Zach Helm has said he conceived of ""Stranger Than Fiction"" in 2001 which would predate Kaufmans films at least. But its hard to imagine Helm and director Marc Forster werent deeply aware of these movies as they went into production.) What compels the viewer in all these movies -- and we can also point to 1997s ""As Good as It Gets"" -- is a sort of moral Odyssey of the brain. The hero has to get over his own mental issues -- think Jack Nicholson avoiding the cracks in ""As Good as It Gets"" -- to win the love that will complete him spiritually. He has to overcome the personal struggle within to prevail in the romantic one without . Whether or not ""Stranger than Fiction"" cribbed from those aforementioned films it does bring something indisputably original to the table the notion of a narrator on the loose. Were so used to the disembodied godlike voice-over no character can hear that when Harold -- at the sound of Kays voice -- interrupts his toothbrushing looks wildly around the bathroom and offers a timid ""Hello?"" we laugh in part because we feel like were entering an exciting new realm. We nearly lick our lips anticipating the intriguing resolutions ahead how Kay invented Harold for instance or what mysterious psychic destiny brought these two together in the first place. Perhaps we contemplate a love in the making. What could be more romantic than a lonely woman inventing a fictional character who becomes her own beshert -- the soul she was forever destined to love? Unfortunately -- or not depending on your perspective -- the filmmakers seem to have their minds on some other movie. Which explains why we find ourselves watching the comically tepid relationship between Harold and Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman) an eccentric literature professor who devotes himself -- mainly for the convenience of the movie -- to helping Harold shake off that narrator mojo so he can get on with loving Ana the bakery owner. Its as though two different movies are running side by side ""Eternal Sunshine of Harolds Mind"" and ""When Harry Met Annie."" Director Forster has an appetite for striking character matchups -- the verboten love between a racist prison guard and the African American wife of a death row prisoner in ""Monsters Ball"" for instance or ""Peter Pan"" creator J.M. Barries mystical attraction to the mother and children who inspire him to create the play in ""Finding Neverland."" So his decision to emphasize the Harold-Ana romance seems predictable. But it also feels like a retreat. Perhaps he and Helm realized the Harry-and-Kay story raises more questions than they could answer. Or maybe they heard voices in their heads -- or voice mails perhaps from studio executives -- suggesting they stick to the romance because Ferrell and Gyllenhaal are so adorable together. Which they are. No one since Woody Allen has made perpetual anguish as shriekingly funny as Ferrell. And where Ferrell amuses Gyllenhaal humanizes. But in That Other Movie Thompsons essentially twiddling her thumbs. (And the less said about Queen Latifah as her alpha assistant the better.) Thompsons never permitted to display that aching softness she brought to other romantic comedies such as ""The Tall Guy"" ""Sense and Sensibility"" and ""Love Actually."" She chain-smokes. She looks up forlornly from the typewriter. She paces her room in search of the perfect ending. But without a decent beginning and middle is it any surprise she has writers block? Stranger Than Fiction (105 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for some disturbing images sexual content brief profanity and nudity.

The idea behind ""Stranger Than Fiction"" is the kind of Charlie Kaufmanesque conceit that sounds a lot better than the way its played out.Will Ferrell plays Harold Crick a robotic IRS agent who discovers that hes hearing a voice in his head the voice of an uppercrust British female and that she is narrating every moment of his life.Since no one else can hear her Harold for a time thinks hes going crazy especially when the voice speaks of his imminent death. He seeks out a psychiatrist (Linda Hunt) who refers him to of all things a literary theorist Professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman). Harold is encouraged to change the script of his life and turn tragedy into comedy. (This business of rewriting ones life script could be intended as a parody of self-help guru-speak except its not played for laughs.) Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Crick feels as though hes a character in his own story but it soon becomes clear that the story actually belongs to Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson) a famously dreary writer who has been unable for 10 years to complete her new novel about a character named Harold Crick. The bulk of the movie is taken up with Harolds attempts to contact the reclusive author and save himself. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Is this a comedy? Not exactly. The screenplay here by Zach Helm is more coy than clever. Helm and his director Marc Forster are too enamored with the films tricky conceit to actually flesh it out. It would have been more interesting and fun for example if we had a better idea of the kind of novel Kay is writing. But she is steadfastly generic - a tortured genius type.Despite his sporadic attempts to breathe some life into Harold Ferrell is generic as well. A morose neat freak who times his days down to the millisecond Harold never really comes to life even when we are supposed to think he does.He falls for Ana (Maggie Gyllenhaal) a rebellious pastry chef hes auditing and with her prodding becomes at best a reasonable facsimile of a human being.Ana is a world-weary free spirit who doesnt believe in paying taxes to support bad government and at first shes so abrasive that we can only assume she will eventually melt. But its Harold who does the melting. The later scenes between Harold and Ana like the one where they share milk and cookies are sensitively played. Gyllenhaal manages to make Ana increasingly sympathetic without defusing her contrarian spirit.Ferrell probably thinks hes being more of an artist in this film than he is in his ""Anchorman""/SNL mode. He couldnt be more mistaken. If he wants to play Hamlet then he should play Hamlet and not this hollow man posing as Everyman. Like Jim Carrey Ferrell seems to think that the way to be taken seriously as a dramatic actor is to drain himself of everything that audiences love about him.Ferrell should take a tip from Dustin Hoffman who after years of strutting as a leading man has settled comfortably - avidly - into character parts. Hoffman seems rejuvenated because he no longer needs to shoulder an entire movie. Ferrell by contrast looks depleted carrying this one. Grade B- Rated PG-13 for some disturbing images sexuality brief language and nudity.Sex/Nudity 5 scenes including implied sex. Violence 2 scenes. Profanity 18 instances including at least one harsh expression. Drugs/Alcohol/Tobacco 2 scenes with drinking 4 with smoking.

"Stranger than Fiction | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; stranger-than-fiction ) Stranger than Fiction (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli Stranger than Fiction does a lot of things exceedingly well and almost none poorly. It takes a great premise and runs with it neither wasting opportunities nor going off on tangents. It features strong work from both the main and supporting actors and manages seamlessly to incorporate both humor and poignancy. I was expecting Stranger than Fiction to be funny; I had not anticipated it to be as touching as it is. Director Marc Forster and screenwriter Zach Helm reveal great affection for their characters and this is apparent in every frame of the finished picture. Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) is a member of the anonymous masses - an IRS agent whose daily routine is dominated by numbers not words or human interaction. For him every day is like every other; for twelve years he has lived a life of solitude. Then comes a mysterious Wednesday when Harold begins to hear a voice. Although he doesnt realize it at the time this is not the voice of god or fate but of author Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson) and shes narrating Harolds experiences. At first he thinks his toothbrush or tie is talking to him but then he figures out whats going on hes the main character in someone elses book. Kays voice is an annoyance until she mentions that little does he know his death is around the corner. This forces Harold to seek help. A psychiatrist (Linda Hunt) thinks he needs to be medicated. A literary professor (Dustin Hoffman) gives him different advice. Although not believing Harolds tale he advises the tax man to figure out whether hes in a comedy or a tragedy. Initial signs point to the latter. Meanwhile Harolds job takes him to a bakery to audit Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal) the baker. She explains to him why she didnt pay her taxes showers him with insults then does everything possible to make his job tough. Harold responds by staring at her breasts stumbling over his words and generally making an ass out of himself. Meanwhile the voice keeps making observations Harold is uncomfortable with. Eventually Ana takes pity on Harold and bakes him some cookies. In the words of one of cinemas immortal characters this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship. Now Harold has something to live for which means its imperative for him to locate the omnipotent force that is directing his actions. This isnt Will Ferrells first attempt at straight acting. He was okay in Melinda and Melinda and not so great in Winter Passing but hes very good here developing a likable character and never going over-the-top. Hes funny when the script wants him to be and heroic or tragic when thats called for. His chemistry with Maggie Gyllenhaal is palpable. Speaking of Gyllenhaal who glows this is another wonderful performance in a line of them. If she doesnt get nominated for something early next year it will be a travesty. She has elevated everything from World Trade Center to Trust the Man to this movie not to mention her powerhouse lead portrayal in Sherrybaby. Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson are fine in supporting roles. Queen Latifa is wasted as Kays assistant. One wonders if the bulk of her work ended up on the cutting room floor because its hard to believe she would otherwise accept such a thankless role. Once upon a time Hollywood films used the slogan ""You laugh and youll cry"" to get people into theaters. Thats literally true of Stranger than Fiction. Forster who moved outside of the mainstream with Monsters Ball and Stay comes back into the fold here but that shouldnt be seen as a negative. This movie has the star power and potential for widespread appeal but its more intelligent than what we usually get from the studios. Nothing in Stranger than Fiction is cookie-cutter or formula driven. Its predictable in short spans but not in an overall sense. The visuals are playful (Ferrells numbers obsessions are colorfully illustrated on the screen with a series of overlays) but the emotional impact is not. Stranger than Fiction is a wonderful cinematic experience - a welcome way to spend a chilly autumn evening.

Its largely down to Charlie Kaufman of course whose scripts for Being John Malkovich Adaptation and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind established that postmodern audiences dont mind their narratives served both scrambled and pre-digested - especially if they come with side orders of wit and outre animation. The mode has since been taken up by David O Russell (I Heart Huckabees) Kaufmans collaborator Michel Gondry (the forthcoming The Science of Sleep) and first-time feature writer Zach Helm with this sometimes enjoyable if more conventional tale.Will Ferrell plays Harold Crick a chronically unassuming taxman with a problem hes got a narrator a voice in his head (Emma Thompsons in fact) providing a commentary on his actions feelings and condition but inaudible to everyone else including the feisty but warm-hearted cafe-owner hes auditing (Maggie Gyllenhaal). Desperate he turns to lit crit prof Dustin Hoffman (more or less reprising his Huckabees schtick) for advice.A great idea for a formally playful short stitched to a standard-issue opposites-attract romcom Stranger than Fiction benefits from brisk pacing and engaging performances - especially from an affectingly muted Ferrell who pulls off a coup comparable to Jim Carreys breakout metaphysical stooge role in The Truman Show. But the film struggles under its increasingly weighty pretensions to literary credibility and even tragic status stumbling towards an unconvincing and cloying conclusion. Deconstructing fiction is one thing taping it back together again quite another.

The oft-examined intersections of reality and fantasy get a thorough workout in ""Stranger Than Fiction."" Bound to be compared to the work of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman who has set the standard for this sort of intricate cinematic mischief over the past several years this first comedy from the unpredictable hot-and-cold director Marc Forster sometimes becomes too self-consciously clever and it doesnt entirely resolve its own central dilemma. But it remains inventive and funny to the end features fine performances from Will Ferrell and especially Emma Thompson and offers enough to enjoy and dispute to make it a good B.O. attraction with long-distance potential for smart-skewing audiences. It will be a revealing test of Ferrells fan base to see how many of those who thronged to ""Talladega Nights"" will follow him into the moderately more rarefied territory of ""Stranger Than Fiction"" which is brainier stuff but far from inaccessible. Non-fans of Ferrell and the most ardent Kaufman devotees likely will find this film too cutesy. Accompanied by a stream of narration by a British female voice and an assortment of diagrams criss-crossing the screen Harold Crick (Ferrell) is introduced as a sorry specimen of human life. A senior agent for the Internal Revenue Service in Chicago hes a virtual automaton; the man rigidly follows the same routine every day has no friends enjoys no vacations. A virtual parody of the company man he doesnt seem quite real. Theres a good reason for this however as Harold is a fictional creation the central character in a new book by celebrated reclusive author Kay Eiffel (Thompson). It is she who is telling Harolds story but something goes awry when he begins hearing her voice in his head. ""Im a character in my own life"" he tells a shrink (Linda Hunt) who can only imagine hes schizo but recommends him to literature professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman) who cant initially figure out whos ""writing"" Harold but recommends he start living the life hes always wanted. And so he does as he takes up the guitar and puts the make on free-spirited baker Ana (Maggie Gyllenhaal) whom he was recently assigned to audit. First-time screenwriter Zach Helm has an evident gift for invention and the story fully engages when its ideas are pushed to their limits forcing the major elements to collide. Kay has been suffering from intense writers block to the point where in an enterprising move her publisher has installed a sort of enforcer (Queen Latifah) in her loft to make sure she doesnt procrastinate. Chain-smoking and fulminating about her creative state Thompson pumps Kay up into a neurotic wonder of a character quite likable for all her obsessive nuttiness. Through a fluke Harold discovers who his creator is and she naturally flips out when he tracks her down. Many complications ensue the main one as the professor helpfully points out being that Kays novels are always tragic. ""You have to die"" Jules warns stressing that to do otherwise would harm a brilliant literary achievement. Stories constructed in this fashion inevitably box themselves into a corner and it takes great creative dexterity to satisfactorily resolve them. Strong questions hover over the way Helm sorts things out here; some will feel cheated others will accept it but either way the upshot does provide something to chew on afterward. Although the films aesthetic is distinctly different its not surprising to learn one of Forsters key inspirations for the film was Jacques Tatis 1967 visionary comedy about modern urban life ""Playtime."" Without constructing a stylized artificial world the director cinematographer Roberto Schaefer and production designer Kevin Thompson create a subtly claustrophobic sense of boxed-in characters by the way they employ sets and existing buildings. Entire pic was lensed in Chicago and the city has rarely been used more inventively. In line with this Ferrells performance is highly focused. At first one fears the worst that hell be forced to play a one-dimensional robot-like character throughout. But once he absorbs his predicament he flexes his humanity without going goofy resulting in a winning portrayal. In his exuberant new phase as a character actor Hoffman continues to be a major boon to any film hes in; his timing has never been better and his interchange with other actors is superb. The girlfriend strand of the storyline with Gyllenhaal while pleasant enough pales a bit compared with the rest. Pic looks and sounds first-class and the soundtrack full of pop tunes is unusually arresting.
