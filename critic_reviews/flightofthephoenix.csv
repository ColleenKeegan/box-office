When their cargo plane crash-lands in the Gobi desert the 11 survivors face a stark choice. Caught between flyboy Dennis Quaids jaded fatalism and nerdy airplane designer Giovanni Ribisis quirky optimism they can either wait for help to arrive or use their energies and dwindling supplies to build a new plane from the wreckage of the old one.If scriptwriters Scott Frank and Ed Burns had explored these tense group dynamics more fully the grounded desert scenes might have generated some suspense and psychological drama. Instead the sketchy characters and flat dialogue just fill the space between the bracketing set-pieces the brilliantly staged opening crash and the nail-biting attempted take-off. Even given more to do Quaid is no James Stewart and the rest of the group barely register. So only the blond-haired bespectacled Ribisi matches the intensity of his predecessor Hardy Kruger.

"Phoenix Rises to the Occasion washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids Phoenix Rises to the Occasion Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 17 2004 UNLIKE THE SURVIVING passengers and crew of the downed C-119 military cargo plane that serves as the centerpiece and main set of ""Flight of the Phoenix"" I could have died a happy death after the films first 15 minutes. The horrific crash and the storm that precipitates it are so visceral so satisfyingly scary and so well filmed that I felt I had gotten my moneys worth before the bulk of the movie had even begun. Okay I didnt actually pay for the screening but if I had it would have been worth it. Even factoring in the cost of a jumbo-size popcorn. Make no mistake This is high-carb filmmaking at its finest. When its all over youll have a knot in your stomach but itll be from the taut stirring adventure as much as from all the junk food you ate. Trust me youll sweat off all the calories anyway. Based on the novel by Elleston Trevor which also inspired a rather good 1965 film starring Jimmy Stewart ""Phoenix"" is the story of a group of people who when their aircraft crash-lands in the Gobi desert decide to rebuild it from the wreckage. Far-fetched? Sure. As luck and the script would have it one of the passengers (Giovanni Ribisi) is even an aircraft designer. What are the odds? But if you dont have that you dont have a movie now do you? What are you going to do? Watch a bunch of plucky but determined amateurs put a complex piece of high technology back together with spit and duct tape? Fortunately this is not the kind of movie that dwells on how the doggone thing gets built. Other than Ribisis character a bleached-blond egghead who approaches but never crosses the line into caricature theres no deus ex machina here either. And no one thank God is called upon to come up with a jury-rigged piece of hardware from his or her back pocket that just happens to fit a hole in the engine. The film like the plane works not because of technology but elbow grease -- courtesy of the fine and largely un-star-studded cast whose characters -- and character flaws -- come vividly to the fore as they battle sand wind and electrical storms marauding smugglers despair heat and one another. Yes there are a couple of ""types"" here but the cast quickly convinces you that theyre real people too. Dennis Quaid as the cocky cynical captain; Hugh Laurie as the stuck-up oil-company ""suit"" whose staff is being evacuated from a dry well; Miranda Otto as the conciliatory peacemaker -- these three come closest to stereotypes but the script by Scott Frank (""Minority Report"" ""Out of Sight"") and jack-of-all-trades Edward Burns goes out of its way to flesh out their personalities. Rounding out the fine ensemble are Tyrese Gibson Tony Curran Kirk Jones Jacob Vargas Kevork Malikyan Scott Michael Campbell and Jared Padalecki. Who? I know but thats the good thing about ""Phoenix."" The only egos youll see on screen are those of the characters not the actors which leaves plenty of room for some soaring thrills and genuine chills in this only-temporarily-earthbound adventure.

Flight of the Phoenix Movie Review (2004) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/flight-of-the-phoenix-2004,200,flightofthephoenix14,flightofthephoenix,rogerebert
"Phoenix fails to rise above diversion - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Phoenix fails to rise above diversion By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  December 17 2004 So let me get this straight The plane carrying you and your recently laid-off oil rig co-workers has just crashed somewhere in the Gobi desert. Theres barely any water and all there is to eat are canned peaches and hearts of palm. Your only credible shot at salvation is to rebuild a new plane from the workable parts of the old one.There are sandstorms electrical storms marauding Mongols a mounting deadline and the annoying fact that each of you seems like an item on a checklist of character types. But in spite of all this you have time to whip out an iPod play OutKasts ""Hey Ya"" dance the robot and bang on pipes? Is this an action movie or ""Stomp""?Thats the kind of picture ""Flight of the Phoenix"" is silly to the last drop of rationed water.It may sound like the big-screen version of ABCs ""Lost"" but the movie is a remake of the tense Robert Aldrich drama from 1965 in which Jimmy Stewart gave one of his most underrated performances as the stern but compassionate leader of a pack of men stranded in the Sahara. The group included such thespians as Richard Attenborough Peter Finch and uh Ernest Borgnine and when they sniped at each other it was funny and a little scary. As a director Aldrich was a master at using comedy to carve out interpersonal strife in the face of larger sweatier crises.The remake however looks almost campy when put next to its predecessor. (Aldrichs son William is one of the producers.) Dennis Quaid plays the Stewart part and Tyrese Gibson (hes grown a surname -- and hair) fills the Attenborough role. OK fills might be an overstatement. He stands in Sir Richards shoes and doesnt really move anywhere.The new movie isnt really about acting anyway. While having say Danny Glover in Gibsons part might have been more dramatically compelling Im guessing Gibson looks better hauling metal with his shirt off. Quaids performance is even more physical He puts the ""ab"" in 50 and fabulous.His Frank Towns and Gibsons A.J. are surly Americans transporting a typically ragtag crew -- the growling hip-hopper (Sticky Fingaz); the pompous Brit (Hugh Laurie); the wise Arab (Kevork Malikyan); the Mexican cook (Jacob Vargas) -- from Mongolia to China when a great computer-generated storm almost literally dismantles their plane sending it plowing into the desert.A few people die in the crash and the survivors especially a scrappy Aussie and the lone dame (Miranda Otto) lean on macho Frank to be more comforting more feeling more like Jimmy Stewart. But he cant He just cant OK?After much bickering a mysterious member of the gang chimes in with the suggestion that they build another plane. Hes a slight platinum blonde named Elliott and Giovanni Ribisis sinister bizarrely accented performance indicates what Peter Lorre might have been like had he joined the Third Reich. In the original the character played by the diabolically hammy Hardy Kruger was a diva a bully and explicitly German. Elliott is from nowhere but we get the point.Ribisi and his tantrums stomp off with the movie especially once the Major Plot Twist is revealed. But ""Flight of the Phoenix"" which John Moore (""Behind Enemy Lines"") directed shrugs away that little surprise. The movie fails to provide the element necessary to put all the nonsense over conviction. Real drama is tossed away to ogle the shirtless fatless male stars and to promote those feel-good snack breaks. Were stuck with a sporadically diverting thriller that has the personality of a Diet Coke ad.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

It was one of the best movies future Dirty Dozen director Robert Aldrich ever made. As in the original the survivors in this remake elect not to roll over and die. Instead they decide to construct a makeshift escape plane from the surviving parts. (Related video Watch the Phoenix trailer) Stranded in the desert Dennis Quaid plays Frank Towns in this remake of the 1965 classic. Twentieth Century Fox The differences this time? The remake (co-produced by Aldrichs son William) is 35 minutes shorter and it casts a wider racial and sexual acting demographic than its white-guy predecessor. This includes poor Miranda Otto who as the only woman asked to fry in the desert sun is doubly unlucky to have a redheads skin tones. And forget Frank DeVols haunting score on the original which is available on DVD. This versions idea of mood-setting is in quick succession Johnny Cashs cover of Hank Snows Ive Been Everywhere James Browns Night Train and Steve Winwood doing Gimme Some Lovin. About the movie Flight of the Phoenix   (out of four) Stars Dennis Quaid; Tyrese; Giovanni Ribisi; Miranda Otto; Sticky Fingaz Directors John Moore Distributor 20th Century Fox Rated Rated PG-13 for some language action and violence Opens Friday nationwide The storys heart is the tension between the very old-school pilot and a Germanic airplane designer who haughtily takes over the survival mission and pushes for the jerry-built replacement machine -- even though this plane looks barely salvageable. Grayish Jimmy Stewart and blond Hardy Kruger were so superlative in these roles that you didnt even think about co-star Ian Bannen who got an Oscar nomination. Standing in for this prickly duo are Dennis Quaid who even if he were a Stewart is too young to convey ""old-school"" and Giovanni Ribisi with a peroxide job gone terribly wrong. Everyone goes through the motions and sweats up a storm. But once a character-driven story no longer has characters worth a look were left with a cool-sounding solar-heat subplot thats tossed off in a silly end-credits coda youd expect to see on a National Lampoon comedy.

What would seem a natural vehicle for souped-up Bruckheimer-like money machine has been kept more low-key in the testosterone zone thanks in part to Aldrichs son William who as one of the producers has shepherded project since the mid-90s. Slightly old-fashioned approach may dampen turnout of action-heads during the holidays but once pic lands as a bells-and-whistles DVD biz will be combustible. Remake of helmer Robert Aldrichs 1965 ""The Flight of the Phoenix"" about an airplane crew and passengers who crash-land in a remote desert shows both how far Hollywoods tech departments have advanced in 40 years and how shallow the pool of solid action thesps has become. What would seem a natural vehicle for souped-up Bruckheimer-like money machine has been kept more low-key in the testosterone zone thanks in part to Aldrichs son William who as one of the producers has shepherded project since the mid-90s. Slightly old-fashioned approach may dampen turnout of action-heads during the holidays but once pic lands as a bells-and-whistles DVD biz will be combustible. Because Aldrich fans cherish ""Flight"" as one of the brawny helmers most fulfilling looks at his favorite topic -- what men in battle reveal about themselves -- any re-do is a cause for both anticipation and concern. Fans hope the great action set pieces can be boosted by the latest CGI wizardry but at the same time any new cast is faced with the unenviable task of trying to match the memory of James Stewarts pilot Richard Attenboroughs co-pilot Hardy Krugers engineer and a support crew played by Peter Finch Ernest Borgnine Ronald Fraser Ian Bannen and Dan Duryea. Rising action director John Moores extremely handsome and fluidly paced production confirms both the hopes and doubts while the script by disparate writers Scott Frank and Edward Burns -- based on both Elleston Trevors novel and Lukas Hellers rich character-driven script for Aldrich -- barely plumbs the depths of either source. Younger auds may dismiss pic as less pumped-up than this sort of studio-driven fare typically is -including Moores own debut ""Behind Enemy Lines."" But Moore displays real strides here as a director of tense big-scaled action dropping characters into slim-odds real-world situations. With Johnny Cash warbling on the soundtrack pilot Frank Towns (Dennis Quaid) with cocky right-hand man AJ (Tyrese Gibson) lands his giant C-119 cargo plane near an oil rig in deepest Mongolia. The wells have gone dry and have been ordered capped by oil companys toppers and manager Ian (Hugh Laurie). The crew led by pissed-off Kelly (Miranda Otto) is told to pack and board the cargo plane for a trip to Beijing. Towns known as ""Shut-It-Down-Towns"" takes no guff and seems to view the crew as cargo to load and drop off while AJ is even more callous. Mystery man Elliott (Giovanni Ribisi) unattached to the flight or the oil crew boards last. Towns misses info about a huge sandstorm in their flight path and ignores Elliotts warning to change course. Planes headlong plunge into the storm sets up pics most spectacular and tense sequence with the plane finally coming to rest on yellowish dunes after losing two passengers half the cargo and a propeller. Mano-a-mano matches promptly start up. For good portions of the script writers Frank and Burns adhere to much of whats good in Hellers story The older crew members urge the younger ones not to walk out into the desert alone and Elliott an aircraft designer gradually convinces the group they can create a new plane out of the intact parts of the crashed cargo ship. Dramatically crucial here is the prickly Towns reluctance to cede authority to weasel-like Elliott who may be their only hope but whose arrogance is chilling. While in the original pic character flaws triggered the obstacles in the new version they seem prompted more by the need for another action scene. Thats primarily due to the supporting characters being barely sketched in -- only Kevork Malikyans thoughtful older Arab gent registers as interesting -- and to director Moores forte for depicting physical danger. The notion that the oil company has done a cost-benefit analysis nixing a rescue of the group is a nice added political dig at Hollywoods new arch-nemesis -- the corporation -- though actions shift from the Arabian desert to the Gobi takes pic out of the worlds political hot-spot. But a crew of generally mid-level actors cant keep this ""Phoenix"" afloat and most of the dramatic charge is just not there. Locked into his familiar scowl for too much of the running time Quaid tends to overly stress Towns dark side and nearly loses the sense that he is the storys hero -- something Stewart kept in virtuoso balance. Ribisi adopts robotic mannerisms that Moores low-angle shots make into threatening images but theres an empty core to the characterization. Otto makes a strong early impression but her Kelly gets lost in the sands with virtually nothing to do after the crash -- a plight that also affects Gibsons AJ perhaps the poorest character transfer from the original. Moore captains an aces production crew led by lenser Brendan Galvin who gets the most from the vivid colors of the desert locales in western Namibia. Aerial work steered by vet airborne lenser David B. Nowell is solid and made more thrilling by digital effects support from numerous effects houses. While Marco Beltramis score is notably restrained song selections drift into the bizarrely inappropriate.

This is the backdrop for Flight of the Phoenix a fuel-injected remake of the meditative 1965 original and its a testament to the verve of ex?commercial director John Moore (Behind Enemy Lines) that a movie so very beige -- in its schematic character and story objectives as well as its color scheme -- could end up so surprisingly vivid. The first Flight starred an aging Jimmy Stewart as the guilt-plagued captain of a twin-engine transport downed in the Sahara. Here a considerably less anguished Dennis Quaid is ferrying castoffs from an abandoned oil rig (""zeros"" were told who ""hitched a ride with the trash"") when a sandstorm forces him to crash-land (with a spectacular thrashing force that leaves you nicely off balance) in the pitiless Gobi seen here as an infinite existential wasteland where losing oneself is a cruelly simple affair. The ragtag band includes Giovanni Ribisis brainiac an androidal but weirdly needy man-child who just might know how to scrape together a new plane from the wreckage of the old one -- or might just be a very blond loon. Dehydrated philosophizing runs high but Flight is foremost an action picture. Refreshingly its actually about action albeit arbitrary action and how it defines us and keeps us alive. But does arbitrariness excuse the use of OutKasts thoroughly depleted ""Hey Ya"" in a dorky montage? No my friends it does not.
