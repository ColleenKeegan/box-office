Russian-US co-production The Darkest Hour attempts to shake things up by sending its fresh-faced American cast off to Moscow just in time to face a plague of wispy ethereal energy spheres from space bent on sapping our precious natural resources. But theres literally nothing here that works the SFX are limp the acting is dire and director Chris Gorak seems to be fighting a losing battle with the concept of narrative logic. Worst of all is the appalling script try taking a shot of whisky every time a character states the bleeding obvious (They killed them all Theyre coming this way). It might be the only way to make it through this slack senseless sci-fi snoozer.

I knew it would be rubbish but unfortunately Dragon Tattoo was sold out and theres no way in hell I would pay for some Thatcher/ Tory propaganda so my only option was this Even though I set the bar low I was still surprised at just how bad the film was. The plot acting dialogue special effects... everything was below par. It is beyond me how a group of people can come together and find millions of dollars to produce a film which has absolutely no merits whatsoever. I give it one star (and thats only because Im rounding up).FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 16 2012UzzielFeaturedUp there with the most painful and costly waste of 2 hours. There is nothing good to say about this film. The acting was Am-Dram at best delivering the most unbelievably bad script. The School Project sets and weaponary were beyond awful. And the 3D was as lame as the film. The studio should be taken to Court for false advertising and forced to return our money.

Unfortunately in this case less is just less. Rather than any Gigeresque monstrosities or the insectoid extraterrestrials of the J.J. Abrams canon the space invaders of this surprisingly thrill-less Moscow-set thriller are invisible for much of the film. When you can see them they resemble nothing more exciting than floating Windows screensavers. By the time these glowing gyros drift down from the night sky like fluff blown off of some cosmic dandelion we?ve already been introduced to our gang of would-be survivors and have pretty much figured out in what order they?re going to die. Not that well be too upset as it?s clear from early on that these characters are as indistinct and lazily rendered as the floating blobs chasing them. The core crew is thus two American entrepreneurial hopefuls (Emile Hirsch and Max Minghella) a craven and duplicitous Swede (Joel Kinnaman) and two female friends on vacation (Olivia Thirlby and Rachael Taylor) now navigating the Russian capital after much of its population has been reduced to ash. The aliens disintegrate any humans they touch like the tripods of 2005s War of the Worlds. But where Steven Spielberg evoked muted horror from the victims cindered remains you get the feeling that The Darkest Hour director Chris Gorak and screenwriter Jon Spaihts just do it because it looks cool. They do manage to eke out some fleeting dread when the creatures electrical fields turn a row of flickering streetlamps into a tense signaled approach. But when the script switches genres exchanging survival horror for resistance fighting it loses whatever momentum it had and you?re left with a battle between two sides neither of which are particularly interesting. You should be rooting for the humans but you might as well be rooting for the blobs. Most likely though you?ll just be rooting for the credits.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet If nothing else the egregiously awful new sci-fi thriller The Darkest Hour adds a formidable new entry in the pantheon of hilariously unfrightening horror movie villains a strange subset that includes such oddities as Death Bed The Bed That Eats. Not since Mark Wahlberg trembled in fear beside a menacing houseplant in The Happening has a film tried to provoke terror with such an unlikely object of menace. The bad guys in The Darkest Hour are energy-based aliens who emerge as migratory clouds of gold dust. Theyre essentially tinsel with an attitude great gobs of glitter with a body count. In the sort of role that inevitably leads to soul-searching introspection and hopefully a change in management a shockingly bad Emile Hirsch stars as an Ugly American abroad in Moscow who soon finds himself fending off mysterious alien invaders alongside pal Max Minghella and love interest Olivia Thirlby. Hirschs character is introduced being smug and condescending to a stewardesss in a manner were supposed to find charming. Instead it digs the glowering Hirsch into a deep hole from which he never emerges. In fact all the whiny unlikable and forgettable characters here make it all too tempting to root for the alien invaders as they listlessly half-heartedly menace the soul-crushing streets of Moscow. The Darkest Hour reeks of desperation even before the cast straps on what looks like homemade versions of Ghostbusters proton-packs and go out on the offensive against the bad guys. The Darkest Hour is a film utterly devoid of merit a dreary sci-fi slog so tedious even its own actors seem bored. Who can blame them? Theyre in a film that tries to make a variation on static cling terrifying.

By the time the closing credits came up however I felt drained of my Yule joy dispirited by this aggressively idiotic movie. Its the sort of film where our plucky band of survivors learns ways to resist their invisible alien foes but then never use that information. Case in point heroes Sean (Emile Hirsch) and Ben (Max Minghella) figure out that they can avoid detection by hiding under a car. Then this bit of intel is never mentioned again so instead of crawling under abandoned vehicles when trying to travel down roads our heroes instead run around screaming making themselves into perfect targets. If these dimwits represent the hope of humanity bring on the alien overlords. Sean and Max have come to Moscow to peddle an internet venture but when their ideas get stolen they head to a hot bar to drown their sorrows. There they run into Skyler (Joel Kinnaman) the stealer of the aforementioned ideas and Natalie (Olivia Thirlby) and Anne (Rachael Taylor). The latter two apparently have the mutant power of having their hair and makeup look awesome even after a week of being chased by invisible aliens but Im getting ahead of myself. Those aliens appear as glowing orbs in the night sky and they immediately set about making all the power go out and vaporizing any human being or dog who gets too close. The quintet of characters who have been given first names hide out in the nightclub kitchen but after a few days of living on canned goods they venture out into the abandoned streets. They soon realize that while the aliens who have wiped out most of the population are invisible they can be detected by the way they make electrical circuits light up in their presence. Sean comes up with the idea of wearing a light bulb around his neck as an early-warning device but only Natalie follows suit. And then run run vaporize meet Nick Frost-ian electronics geek (Dato Bakhtadze as Sergei) with an anti-alien microwave gun run run encounter homemade-weapons-brandishing good ol boys who look like the cast of a Muscovite remake of ""Bellflower."" Writer Jon Spaihts and director Chris Gorak seem unable to provide suspense shocks characters or even memorable technobabble. Hirsch Minghella and Thirlby have done interesting work in the past and probably will in the future but all they have to show for ""The Darkest Hour"" was the free trip to Russia. In the final wash this movie has three interesting things to offer the empty post-apocalyptic streets of modern-day Moscow the unpredictable death of a major character and a cat named after ""Yo Gabba Gabba"" star DJ Lance Rock. None of those things merits the interruption of your holiday. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

"The Darkest Hour review Alien invasion in Russia - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesThe Darkest Hour review Alien invasion in RussiaA group of young people has to fight invaders that seemingly feed off electricity.December 27 2011|By Mark Olsen Special to the Los Angeles Times Olivia Thirlby and Emile Hirsch star in ""The Darkest Hour."" (Summit Entertainment )When the end of the world comes would you really want to be in a sleazy Russian nightclub? Thats one of the essential questions pondered in ""The Darkest Hour"" in which aliens invade the planet and a small group of attractive young people fight to survive and make their way elsewhere. As the film opens two American web entrepreneurs (Emile Hirsch Max Minghella) are heading to Moscow looking for funding for their location-based social media service. After they are double-crossed by a would-be business partner (Joel Kinnaman) they go to drown their sorrows in a nightspot where they meet a couple of young women (Olivia Thirlby Rachael Taylor) who are impulsively traveling the globe. Then an invasion of diaphanously floating twinkly lights hits the city apparitions that turn anyone that crosses their path to dust. Seemingly feeding off of (and given away by) electricity the invaders are more easily seen at nighttime setting the youngsters on a series of dimly-lit adventures as they make their way across the city. None of them is exactly prepared to go into survivalist mode especially the two young women in their thin sparkly tops that looked cute in the club but are definitely not apocalypse-ready. Thirlby actually carries her high heels around for a while running in bare feet until she can find a suitable pair of boots when they all briefly encamp in an abandoned shopping center. As Hirsch asks at one point ""Whats the dress code for the end of the world? Jacket no tie?"" Director Chris Gorak previously made the effective low-budget horror-thriller ""Right at Your Door"" and in making this move to a splashy bigger film his instincts for character have perhaps been overwhelmed by the demands of a larger production. Capable and compelling performers like Hirsch and Thirlby seem left to their own devices to make some connection with the material. The idea of semi-invisible aliens an unseen enemy should mean the film has a lingering sense of paranoid abstraction (not unlike ""Right at Your Door"") but ""Darkest Hour"" never gets beyond rote efficiency. Though the production did shoot in Russia a including gaining access to iconic locations like Red Square a the separation of spatial planes created by using 3-D technology as well as the notorious murkiness of 3-D projection make the real-world shots look oddly fake. Whats the point of going all the way to Moscow if the shots you come back with end up looking like cheap green-screen process work? calendar.latimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESRussian skywalkers look upward for escapeJanuary 28 2013Young and proudly pro-PutinDecember 25 2007COLUMN ONE  Burying the Soviet Past With Lenin  Anxious...December 6 1993People and EventsFebruary 5 1988MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesEntertainmentYoung PeopleMoscowCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/reviews/la-et-the-darkest-hour-20111227,0,4407038.story?track=rss",200,thedarkesthour5,thedarkesthour,latimes

TWITTER Chris Goraks apocalyptic feature stars Emile Hirsch and Olivia Thirlby. Apocalyptic fantasy goes to Russia in The Darkest Hour an alien invasion flick that evidently expects dramatic shots of a depopulated Red Square to make up for a flatlining screenplay and the absence of even a single compelling character. Some diverting effects work and a puzzling (if badly developed) premise may keep audiences from throwing in the towel but ho-hum word-of-mouth should lead to quickly fizzling box office. VIDEO The Darkest Hour Trailer After his intriguing twist on biohazard drama in 2006s Right at Your Door director Chris Gorak is slavishly obedient to genre expectations here finding no way to enliven a by-the-numbers survival tale. (Heres hoping Darkest Hour is no indication of what we can expect from screenwriter Jon Spaihtss next credit the Alien spinoff Prometheus.) American buddies played by Emile Hirsch and Max Minghella are hitting on two tourists (Olivia Thirlby and Rachael Taylor) when a blackout strikes Moscow. Countless small effervescent clouds descend from the sky soaking up all electricity and vaporizing any biological entity they can find. After waiting out the invasions first stage in a storeroom the quartet (and a craven hanger-on) decide to head for the American embassy. Though the invaders are invisible except when attacking and make no sound the kids manage some implausibly astute deductions about how they operate the vaporous creatures cant sense humans through glass (huh?) and whenever theyre nearby electrical devices spring to life. (The latter fact allows for some nice visual cues involving lightbulb-strewn battlegrounds.) For one brief sequence this silliness almost comes to life Our heroes meet a grizzled pot-bellied tinkerer who has turned his apartment into a Faraday cage protecting himself from electro-sensitive aliens while perfecting a microwave raygun he thinks will make them vulnerable. As the inventor Dato Bakhtadze promises to enliven a wooden ensemble (whose capable young actors have nothing to work with scriptwise) but the film dispenses with him minutes after his arrival. PHOTO The Darkest Hour One-Sheet Promises Holiday Destruction Producer Timur Bekmambetov who created the nonsensical but stylistically imaginative supernatural epics Night Watch and Day Watch might be expected to bring the film some homebrew quirks or at least a convincing grime. But outside of Bakhtadzes lair and the funny conductive armor worn by a small band of Russian military survivors (the leader wears chainmail made of stitched-together housekeys) the picture suffers from an oppressive ordinariness. Action beats grow more effective as the short tale nears its climax -- though Hirschs sudden insights into electrical engineering are tough to swallow -- but any goodwill evaporates with a shrugworthy denouement in which a twentysomethings ability to receive text messages is proffered as cause for celebration.
