Terrence Malicks ""The New World"" wipes clean our palette. The visionary director of ""Badlands"" and ""The Thin Red Line"" dispenses with pomp and rhetoric and plunks us in a grassy field that would become Jamestown Va. where in 1607 weary armor-clad white men make first contact with ""the naturals."" Barely clothed faces painted the natives circle the newcomers poking sniffing licking curious to see what these hairy fellows are made of. Its an astonishing scene at once monumental lyrical and almost comically intimate. You can feel the grass underfoot the humidity in the air. This is for the Europeans the dawn of a new world; its also nothing more or less than a bunch of wary frightened men in a field who may or may not have a future. And for Chief Powhatans tribe its the beginning of the end of their old world whose rules and customs the interlopers have no interest in understanding.Malicks magnificent frustrating epic mixes fact and legend to conjure up a reverie about Pocahontas (Qorianka Kilcher) her love for Capt. John Smith (Colin Farrell) and her crossing from one culture to another. Its a voyage that leads her to Christianity stiff leather shoes and marriage to tobacco grower John Rolfe (Christian Bale) who takes his young Powhatan princess bride to London to meet the king and queen. Just as Malick and his great cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki enable us to see the New Worlds landscape through Smiths awed eyes we discover England through hers. Its as if were seeing Western civilization for the first time its formal gardens lunar in their beauty.The casting of the unknown 14-year-old Kilcher proves a masterstroke. Her Pocahontas is playful proud soulful. Kilchers face (shes of native Peruvian descent) has a chiseled changeable beauty you want to study from every angle. Historians doubt that the real Pocahontas and Smith were ever lovers but Malick spins a compelling romance sweet passionate--and deceptive. Farrell is a tender seducer but her love for him puts her at odds with her own people whom shes forced to betray. ""Dont trust me"" Smith warns even as he pleads for her devotion. ""You dont know who I am."" The tragic collision of two competing cultures lurks inside his ambivalence. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Conventional storytelling doesnt interest Malick. Nature is as much a character as the humans. Scenes that would traditionally be played for high drama--Smith in chains for subordination saved from hanging by the ships captain (Christopher Plummer)--are tossed off in a quick aside. More poet than dramatist Malick prefers interior monologues to dialogue eavesdropping on the inner thoughts of his three main characters as he did in ""The Thin Red Line."" With mixed results. These whispered ruminations are beautifully written but whose voice are we hearing? Malicks early-17th-century characters all suspiciously share the introverted 21st-century sensitivity of their creator.Malick works instinctively discovering his movies as he films them on location then rediscovering and reshaping them in the editing room. The reward is moments of transcendent beauty. What gets sacrificed is structure. The meditative meandering middle of ""The New World"" is like a symphony with three adagio movements in a row. You hunger for a scherzo. The paradoxical Malick is a shoot-from-the-hip perfectionist who may be temperamentally incapable of making perfect movies. He cant see the forest because hes head over heels in love with the beauty of the trees.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

"The New World. Slate Sign In Sign Up The New World. The New World. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Jan. 20 2006 617 PM Malick in Wonderland The New World is another chin-scratching poem. By Dana Stevens Farrell as Capt. John Smith For a certain core group of patient passionate cinephiles The New World (New Line) Terrence Malicks retelling of the story of the Jamestown settlement was already a major movie event before it even hit screens last Christmas. (Since withdrawn for a recut by the director the movie reopens nationwide today in slightly shortened form.) Malick began his career with two films of an almost Rimbaudian purity and perfection Badlands (1973) and Days of Heaven (1978). These movies both of them lyrical reflections on doomed love against the backdrop of a cruel (but lushly filmed) nature made Malicks name as a poetic and visionary director on par with Stanley Kubrick or Francis Ford Coppola. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. But post-Days of Heaven Malick dropped out of sight. He refuses to be photographed hasnt given a real press interview in more than 30 years and fields whatever questions do cross his path with a vague ""Uh I guess I dont want to talk about that."" The Thin Red Line (1998) Malicks return to filmmaking after 20 years was generally received as a failure but it was a fascinating one--a World War II epic that eschewed conventional plot and character in favor of endless nature shots and overlapping dreamy voice-overs. ""Why does nature contend with itself?"" asked an off-screen Jim Caviezel in the opening frames over an image of tree-suffocating vines. No doubt a less compelling question to most soldiers than ""Wheres my body armor?"" but that obliqueness was part of Malicks point--to step back from the immediacy of battle and ponder the strangeness of war itself. Advertisement The New World takes a shopworn American myth--the first encounter of settlers and Indians at Jamestown and the romance between Pocahontas (QOrianka Kilcher) and Capt. John Smith (Colin Farrell)--and runs it through the Malick-izer making it feel rich strange and new. In so doing the film takes wild liberties with historical accuracy. Most serious scholars now dispute the notion that the Indian girl and the English adventurer were sexually involved though Smiths memoirs do relate how she begged her father the tribal chief Powhatan to spare his life after his capture. But the Smith/Pocahontas affair is like the erotic equivalent of the Thanksgiving story It is true as a metaphor a condensation of fantasies about colonization and first contact. For all this abstract talk of metaphor the experience of watching The New World is primarily a sensory one. Theres the sound of wind in marsh grass; a haunting Mozart piano concerto that becomes the lovers theme song; the play of light on water; and the endlessly interesting physiognomy of Kilcher a gorgeous teenage actress of Swiss/Peruvian descent. In her early love scenes with Farrell Kilcher is playful and incandescent a kid with a handsome new toy; later after her move to Jamestown she conveys through her rigid gait alone the indignities of assimilation. The argument could be made that Kilchers role and the films representation of Native Americans in general plays into idealizing stereotypes of the unspoiled Indian. Farrell muses in voice-over that the ""naturals"" are ""gentle faithful loving lacking in all guile and trickery."" But Malick is not a documentarian or a cultural-studies historian; hes a storyteller and I would argue that part of the story hes trying to tell is about how the process of miscegenation inevitably invites us to construct such Edenic myths. Malick is obsessed with Eden or perhaps more precisely obsessed with Americas obsession with it. All of his films contain these paradisiacal usually erotic interludes. But even as the lovers cavort in their makeshift treehouses or smooch by the river they realize that their idyll is fragile threatened by the imminent reality of work or winter or war. The New World slows down in its second half when John Smith sails on to seek the East Indies and Pocahontas believing him dead moves to the English colony and marries a dull but loving fur trader (Christian Bale). The final scenes documenting her trip to England and presentation to the court as a ""princess of the New World"" struck me as too hagiographic straight out of a standard-issue biopic. But the first hour of the film is laden with visual and auditory treats including some wonderful actors in small parts. Theres Christopher Plummer as the leader of the expedition from England and David Thewlis who was born to play a humorless sadistic Puritan. In her review of The Thin Red Line in 1998 Janet Maslin spoke of the ""innate momentousness"" of Malicks films. A less generous phrase might be ""innate portentousness."" The New World is rife with voice-over lines that are as likely to elicit giggles as they are earnest chin-scratching. Even the movies opening invocation spoken by Pocahontas (""Come spirit. Help us sing the story of our land."") may strike some as a pretentiously literary conceit echoing the first lines of a Homeric epic. But Malicks signature technique is light-years away from the usual expository Hollywood voice-over which tends to spell out in drearily explicit prose whatever the screenwriter is too lazy to convey through other means. The lyrical musings of Malicks characters do just the opposite They burrow deeper into questions that the cinematography and sound design are already asking. It makes sense that Malick never finished his thesis in philosophy at Oxford. In a way hes still writing it using his films as scratchpads to work through questions like the one John Smith poses to himself early in the film ""What voice is this that speaks within me guides me toward the best?"" The New World isnt Terrence Malicks best but its guiding him in the right direction. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

"On the Far Horizon The New World Slowly Emerges washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On On the Far Horizon The New World Slowly Emerges Pocahontas (Qorianka Kilcher) protects John Smith (Colin Farrell) in Terrence Malicks romantic history. (By Merie Wallace -- New Line Productions) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday January 20 2006 Look at the savages What beasts Snarly smelly infested with fleas and lice their skins marred by hideous markings their visages warlike their language a strange clottage of war whoops and gurgles. And those are the British Thats the initial point of view in Terrence Malicks ""The New World"" an attempt to rescue the founding of Jamestown and the myth of Capt. John Smith and Pocahontas in 1607 from the swamp of kitsch into which it has sunk. But at first it seems almost like something that might be named ""Bambi vs. the Flying Saucers"" set in a tidewater theme park called Benevolent Nature with the forest creatures -- graceful beautiful magical -- contemplating the clanking stumbling invaders whove beamed down from Olde Englande courtesy of strangely festooned motherships abob on the estuaries of the Chesapeake. Malick almost has some fun chronicling this first encounter of the close kind. The Native Americans are at first amused by the outsiders Theyve never seen so much hair smelled such vile vapors (the boys have been cramped into a vessel little bigger than a Volvo for about eight months) and can make no sense of metal helmets swords high-heeled shoes and most of all white faces. Theyre like curious fawns touching and giggling. But soon it dawns on them that the furry boys and their prim pale womenfolk mean to stay. Thats evident as Jamestown itself arises and in no short period of time has come to replicate the glories of a Liverpool slum complete to slatternly ill-built buildings puddles of fetid water mud pigs chickens scraps of junk wood and a surrealist agriculture dedicated to exotic doomed grains. And then that contagion of human socialization intrudes the contagion of politics. Malick cuts quickly between the various factions on each side of the Lincoln Log fence the settlers erect In the Powhatan councils it is debated whether to kill or ignore the intruders; in the English it is debated whether to kill or ignore the Indians. Gradually personalities emerge. Rima the Bird Girl there the barefoot Indian lass with Suzy Parkers delicate toes pedicured cute as baby bunnies shes Pocahontas. That particularly gnarly brute hairy as a bear and smelly as an outhouse in July thats John Smith. The actors are Peruvian Indian-Swiss teenager Qorianka Kilcher and Irish heartthrob Colin Farrell. Each looks the part Shes dark swift beautiful and hes got the strength and thews of a man who was a mercenary and had seen combat all over Europe and the Middle East. Is it love at first sight? Well . . . hard to say. Its something at first sight but why should we be hasty when the director is never hasty. Thats because Malick is of the introspective sort. Hes the only man in history who could make a boring movie about the battle of Guadalcanal (""The Thin Red Line"") and turn a Charles Starkweather-like mad dogs kill spree into a philosophic inquiry (""Badlands."") Here his distance from emotional engagement keeps the players far away as if through the wrong lens of a telescope; thus its hard to feel much for them or their turmoil if its turmoil at all theyre feeling. Its certainly not lust The movie is almost sexless and the play between the two romantic leads (and later with a third cast member Christian Bale as Pochahontass eventual hubbie John Rolfe) is all frisky necking and snuggling. It has a kind of 18th-century innocence almost like Fragonards ""The Swing"" the 1767 painting that encapsulates romantic purity. (Frankly I much preferred the scalawag-horndog John Smith of John Barths fabulous novel of that time and place and the devil plant tobacco ""The Sot-Weed Factor."") Malick is far more interested in states of nature which he expresses with extremely slow camera movement that notes with stunning precision how nature arranges bushes as opposed to how man arranges bushes. Really is it that big a deal? Especially when it turns out he favors nature over man. You see this choice running through the film. The forests of Tidewater country are lush enchanting inviting; in England theyve been reduced to mazes cruelly cut into box hedges perverted into something monstrous and different. Its so easy . Likewise the buildings of the two races The interior of a tribal lodge is filmed as if its a cathedral bathed in radiant light through a stained-glass window while the interior of the English hutches at Jamestown are threadbare not merely decoratively but by metaphorical extension spiritually impoverished. Again easy . The surprise -- and the discordance -- arises from the disconnect between the design of the film and the design of the characters. He could have settled for easy demonics of the Kevin Costner school Indians saintly whites monstrous. The artist in him -- or possibly the adult in him -- knows its never that simple and fortunately the actors are adept enough to suggest however wispily some ambiguities of character. Colin Farrell even makes you forget that he is Colin Farrell. Thus the movies more interesting drama is the nuances of personality in the mesh of myth. Its all here all the highlights of the Pocahontas magical mystery tour how she intercedes to keep the captains head from getting pulped by boys who look like refugees from a Goth band; how the two -- hes in his thirties shes 13 (the actress is 15) -- fall in love and communicate; how in winters icy grip she leads her people on a relief mission out of sympathy for the starving white hairy ones; how she hides corn kernels by which the settlers finally learn to tease a life from the earth; how she is banished by her father then kidnapped by the whites then falls in love and marries the Englishman Rolfe (for whom we may issue thanks as he first domesticated for home use the sot weed of the Barth book thus sparing so many of us of a boring old age); and how finally she goes off to England to meet the king. It was here that it dawned on me and it will dawn on you that the thing was actually conceived of as a romantic triangle. In Merry Olde Englande she settles into a country squiresss life and soon bears the country squire a boy child. But then the thunderingly romantic dark hairy soldier/explorer/writer/tattooed bad boy returns. Will she stay or will she go? Oh thats what this movie is about. Why didnt you say so earlier? There are other annoyances. Like every movie Malick has ever made -- not that hes made that many having taken a 20-year vacation between ""Badlands"" and ""The Thin Red Line"" -- this one was edited way down from a longer version. Thats beginning to feel like a self-inflicted pattern It lets him take credit for what might have been but not responsibility for what is. In this case even in the past few weeks 16 minutes have come out of the initial version screened for critics (it still moves too slowly). And the original cast announcement (available on the Internet Movie Database) lists a variety of prominent performers -- Jonathan Pryce Noah Taylor and Ben Chaplin -- who are now nowhere to be seen. Two great Native American actors -- Wes Studi and August Schellenberg -- are visible but almost without lines. And that might explain another silliness The movie has a bloody battle sequence in which it appears that dozens of the already short-handed colonists are killed but after the fighting the same number of Englishmen and Indians are running about. ""The New World"" is stately almost to the point of being static and thus has trouble finding a central story around which to arrange itself; its not quite the thin dead line but its close. The New World (135 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for sexual suggestion and violence.

More important it boldly explores new cinematic territory. 1 / 2 Back to Gallery The New World Drama.Starring QOrianka Kilcher Colin Farrell and Christian Bale. Directed by Terrence Malick. (PG-13. 135 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) With most movies a shorthand description or a reference to another film is enough to convey a sense of the experience. But Terrence Malicks ""The New World"" is not like any other movie. In its emotional effect and in the ways it makes its points this motion picture is much more akin to poetry or music. Malick uses cinema in a way no one else uses it in a way that no one else has ever used it. Through elliptical and seemingly oblique methods he forges moments of staggering emotional power. Ideally it would be best to pull down a screen and show you the beginning of ""The New World"" rather than clumsily describe what cant be described. But lets try. As Wagners prelude to ""Das Rheingold"" plays Malick depicts in those first minutes the landing of British colonists on what was soon to be known as Virginia. He intercuts from the people aboard the ships to the Indians watching from the woods alarmed and curious. Moving almost as if in a ballet the Indians are seen in silhouette against the blue waters as the ships now 50 yards away pull ever closer. Nothing can stop it now. American history is about to begin. What cant be conveyed but must be explained is the strong effect of this artful arrangement of images and music. In those first moments Malick realistically depicts the colonists arrival and creates a wistful dream of it a dream in which we know everything that is to come. He shows us a moment of greatness of incalculable historical importance and also of tragedy -- for the Indians who stand there in complete innocence. This is the beginning of everything and the end of everything and to see it all so distinctly presented with such a full-hearted understanding of the event in all its meaning is almost too much to bear. There will be people who will walk into this film cold and within five minutes find themselves sobbing without quite knowing why. ""The New World"" is a masterpiece. Its also a little bit boring. Malick himself realized this and cut out 15 minutes (all scenery) after its limited release in December. This probably helps (I saw the long version) but no matter. I regard the dull bits as a by-product of the same process by which Malick gives us the grand moments. He lavishes time experiments with combinations of images sound and voiceover until unspoken connections and meanings are passed on to the viewer. Its dull and then dazzling dull and then brilliant dull and then awe-inspiring. It lulls viewers into a pleasant trance and then interrupts that trance at frequent intervals for some of the best filmmaking imaginable -- some of it beyond imagining. Malick tells the story of Pocahontas and the films central insight which is never overtly stated is that she even more than the colonists was in a very real sense the first American. While the colonists brought their English culture to America intact it was Pocahontas fate to endure all the cultural dislocation of the immigrant experience albeit on her own native soil. Her life journey just a brief span of years was epic and as depicted here enormously moving. We first meet her (QOrianka Kilcher) as a teenager full of playfulness and spontaneity gamboling through the fields as a happy young thing. A voiceover by John Smith (Colin Farrell) speaking words from Smiths memoir recalls Pocahontas as the chiefs favorite daughter the prettiest and the smartest. Much of ""The New World"" is told in this way with seemingly random voiceovers spoken over music and images of nature. Its as if were seeing a memory. A recurring motif a signature of the Pocahontas scenes is to show the open vista of the sky from her perspective. There are straight dialogue scenes as well but as placed within a mosaic of these dreamy music-and-voiceover sequences the more conventional scenes also seem part of a recollection a specific moment of lucid memory in the midst of a passionately felt vagueness. As we all know from grammar school Pocahontas saved Smith from being beaten to death in an Indian ritual and what follows in the movie is an innocent romance. Later her aid to the British causes her to be ostracized by her own people and we find her suddenly wearing incongruous bulky English clothes looking as if her soul has been smashed. But it hasnt. She regains her spirit and is courted by the kindly John Rolfe (Christian Bale) and when they marry they devise what has since become a time-honored way for non-Americans of different backgrounds to create future Americans They have a child on American soil. A later scene of Pocahontas playing hide-and-seek with her child in a manicured English garden completes our sense of her journey with eloquent simplicity. It suggests all the things Malick wants to express about the inspiring resiliency of Pocahontas personality and also about the character of what was being created in the new world. A powerful concluding image shows the sky as Pocahontas once saw it. An insect zips across the corner of the screen -- thats how fast that life went by and yet such grandeur in the living of it. Kilcher a newcomer to movies is everything one could hope for in the role. Farrell is at least as rugged and magnetic as Smith claimed to be and Bale does that impossible thing -- he makes goodness look interesting. But ultimately ""The New World"" isnt a showcase for the actors. Its a profound achievement of directorial vision. In his Nobel acceptance speech Ernest Hemingway said that to do something truly great a writer must drive himself ""far out past where he can go out to where no one can help him."" Frankly I find it impossible to imagine how Malick made this movie how he saw it in his head how he put it together how he dared hope he could succeed artistically. How did he know that when he put this film together it would even make sense? Its rare in commercial cinema for a director to go this far out to that no-mans land that Hemingway described. Its yet more rare for one to come back with something this beautiful. -- Advisory Some violence.

Malick also takes his time on screen leisurely unfolding The New Worlds oft-told tale about Pocahontas (Qorianka Kilcher) the American Indian princess who meets British explorers in 1600s Virginia. But theres method to the madness of Malicks snails pace. TheNew World like his Days of Heaven is drenched in mood and ambience. For much of its length its rewards lie in its painterly poetic atmosphere -- a hypnotic blend of production design location work cinematography and orchestral score. As the first wary and then hostile encounters between the Indians and the English spin toward tragedy historical events are less compelling than the aura Malick creates. Stunned sailors led by Capt. Newhart (Christopher Plummer) are like astronauts landing on an Eden-like planet except they enter this paradise unprepared. Illness hunger and madness assail them. And when the initially curious natives learn the visit will become an entrenched invasion resentment and bloodshed erupt. Against this conflict blooms a tender (and nonhistorical) romance between soldier John Smith (Colin Farrell) and Pocahontas. Each goes native for the others culture Pocahontas most of all wearing English clothes and even sailing to the Old World. But events tear them apart -- and thats where the film goes wrong. Malick is so content to tell the tale through mood that he neglects its meaning. We rarely get inside characters heads despite the fact Smith Pocahontas and settler John Rolfe (Christian Bale) speak in narration. That especially hurts the films busy conclusion. Though the material is familiar major events skip by without much comment; the film has an underwritten feel. This doesnt discount Malicks artful sense of time and place. He makes current-day Virginia along the Chickahominy River look untainted and timeless in its natural splendor. Malick honored that splendor by filming solely with available light showing rapt absorption for each trickling stream and rustling leaf. Yet he should have shed more light on his characters motivations. Farrell is suitably intense but also tight-lipped and internalized. Bales selfless tobacco grower is even more of a soulless narrative device not a flesh-and-blood man. Kilcher at least charms with guileless radiance and sensitivity. She was just 14 when the film was shot and ideal to play a woman-child discovering new worlds -- from a mans tender embrace to a new continents culture. If Malick had let her convey more with words not just her eyes his film might have had more meaning to go with its rich feeling. bruce.westbrookchron.com Todays Deals NFL Caps at Lids for 10 + free shipping w/ 50 Ozark Trail 10x10-Foot Gazebo Top for 25 + pickup at Walmart Open-Box Wolfgang Puck 22L Pressure Oven for 70 + free shipping Samsonite Leather Dowel 16"" Flapover Case for 60 + free shipping Powered by Contests Enter to win concert tickets airfare and hotel More Entertainment News Rolling Stones Lash Out at Donald Trump (Again) Over Song Use Daveed Diggs Renee Elise Goldsberry to Leave Hamilton Broken Social Scene Working on New Album Steve Young of M/A/R/R/S Pump Up the Volume Fame Dead Calvin Harris Taylor Swift Song Co-Write Questions We Still...

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Terrence Malick makes tremendous movies while pretending hes not really paying attention. Hollywood babbles on front and center blah blah blah and Malicks camera turns elsewhere gazing at the tall grass as it waves in the breeze following a flock of birds wheeling overhead watching a pair of hands cupping precious rainwater. His microphones listen for everything but dialogue capturing the crackle of a fire or the rustle of fabric or the dreamy narration of a character drifting between bliss and despair. Make no mistake there is always plot and plenty of it. Serial killers in ""Badlands."" A wild West Macbeth in ""Days of Heaven."" World War II in ""The Thin Red Line."" And now the white man unsettling Pocahontas and America in ""The New World."" But Malick wont debate Pocahontas or colonization in any conventional way. He understands the emotional power of stillness like no director going and the stunning beauty of ""The New World"" makes it more the pity Malick himself chooses to keep quiet for a decade between films. ""The New World"" is a poetic force at once wrenching and soothing. The question of whether Powhatan favorite daughter Pocahontas loved new settler Capt. John Smith has never been settled. Malick chooses love but not the simple way. The infatuation Pocahontas and Smith develop is overwhelmed by the deep yearning they both feel for the unspoiled American continent. Smith played with moving agony by Colin Farrell is a misfit who believes Virginias rapturous landscape may be a new Eden for mankind. Pocahontas in a mesmerizing debut by 15-year-old Qorianka Kilcher is a childlike Eve without the guile. She is certain that mother sun and father moon can heal these troubled invaders. Malick best illuminated his outlook in ""The Thin Red Line"" juxtaposing the blinding eternal green slopes of Guadalcanal with the petty bloodshed of temporary human occupiers. Nature is indifferent to human suffering Malick constantly argues and mankinds indifference to nature is the original sin. Supported by a haunting score of classical music Pocahontas and Smith play out this insoluble drama amid the incompetence and cruelty of the Jamestown settlers. The most painful shock of the movie comes when the Indians lead Smith back to the white compound. He has spent a long idyll in the woods with the Powhatans blending in with their rhythmic life. They have blindfolded Smith before escorting him home - being innocent but not stupid. The shade comes off and Smith gazes upon a filthy diseased settler compound fast devolving into anarchy. Skillfully edited for length since first shown in New York and Los Angeles ""The New World"" moves on to second and third acts that underline the metaphor of characters entering unfamiliar territory. Pocahantas is rejected by her tribe after a betrayal and Smith has been ordered away; she begins a tentative romance with a kind white planter John Rolfe (Christian Bale). They eventually travel to England for a royal audience. Once there in another key scene always dependent on a silent observers view of bewildering surroundings Malick follows one of the Indians who joined Pocahontas across the Atlantic. Echoing the opening act in which Smith marvels at the odd trees and bird calls of tidewater Virginia the Indian takes a chilly November walk through the manicured gardens of what looks like Regents Park. He struggles to understand the people through how they have shaped their landscape. ""The New World"" like the other three Malick movies will be frustratingly slow and empty to some viewers. Malick does not give the gifts we ask for; he offers instead what he thinks we need. You may fault him for that and walk out of the former philosophy teachers cinema seminar. But you would be denying yourself a new look at the old world all around.

(CNN) -- By 1607 the civilized world knew the earth was not flat. Unfortunately nobody passed that tidbit of information along to writer-director Terrence Malick.Malicks new film ""The New World"" -- only his fourth in 32 years -- is as flat as a flapjack. This ponderous film -- about the settlement of the Jamestown colony by the British and the love story of Capt. John Smith and the Indian princess Pocahontas -- almost totally lacks exposition and offers colorless characters beyond the main leads leaving the audience with little to hold on to.Its a shame because other aspects of the film are brilliant. Emmanuel Lubazkis cinematography is utterly stunning. Jack Frisks production design and Jacqueline Wests costume design are flawless. They truly capture how raw life must have been like for the 103 original settlers struggling to carve an existence out of the pristine -- and at times unforgiving -- wilderness of Virginia 400 years ago.The story such as it is is extremely unfocused and unfolds mainly through a muddled and jerky narrative told -- for the most part -- in voice-over by Smith (Colin Farrell) Pocahontas (QOrianka Kilcher 14 at the time of filming) and later by John Rolfe (Christian Bale) who eventually married Pocahontas.In the dawning years of the 17th century three English ships financed by the London Virginia Company crossed the Atlantic looking for gold and a shortcut to the South Seas. They were sorely disappointed on both counts. What they found instead was a land ruled by a powerful man Chief Powhatan.When Smith leads a food-gathering expedition he is captured by Powhatans tribe and escapes death only because of the intervention of Powhatans favorite child Pocahontas. She teaches him the ways of her culture and months later he returns to Jamestown.Later when Powhatan discovers that the settlers actually intend to stay he prepares for war. Pocahontas warns Smith of the impending attack and is banned from her people forever. Eventually the English and Smith take her in.Smith is later ordered to head an exploration of the northern coast of America as the British are still searching for a pathway to the South Seas. He arranges for Pocahontas to be told he died at sea.Heartbroken she eventually meets and falls in love with another Englishman Rolfe with whom she has a son. He took her to England where she was received by the King and Queen. Tragically she died before she could return to Virginia.Thats the story. But Malick cant decide whether hes making a nature film a love story or an action/adventure flick.There are endless shots of waving grain and dripping leaves interspersed with bloody battles between the Native Americans (called Naturals in the film) and the settlers. The budding romance between Smith and Pocahontas s-l-o-w-l-y evolves over the course of about two-thirds of the film. The pacing of the film is enough to kill off any interest in the beauty of its images.Watching ""The New World"" is like watching a snail cross an eight-lane highway. Perhaps theres a director or editor who could make that concept enthralling but as for me I kept longing that Jerry Bruckheimer would speed along in a Hummer and squish it flat.

John Smith and Pocahontas and the Jamestown colony is only his fourth film in 34 years. Hes a perfectionist who has never achieved perfection. He spent two years editing ""Days of Heaven"" for example and the result was a disjointed procession of pretty pictures. ""Badlands"" his first and best film was also his most unified - an imagistic but taut meditation on murder starring Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek as serial killers in love.His previous film 1998s ""The Thin Red Line"" based on the James Jones novel about the battle between American and Japanese soldiers on Guadalcanal demonstrated that Malick could direct startlingly good action sequences when he put his mind to it - which wasnt often. He has always favored ruminative interior monologues to exterior drama.""The New World"" combines both modes. On the surface - and what a picturesque surface it is - Malick is recounting the familiar history-class tale of how Captain Smith played by Colin Farrell and his fellow Englishmen arrived in Jamestown in 1607 and proceeded to mix it up with Chief Powhatan and his tribe. The chiefs daughter Pocahontas played by 14-year-old newcomer Qorianka Kilcher gambols in the woods with the captain. They have a quasi-romance that at times seems more Disney than Malick. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? But then again Malick has never stressed romance in his movies - at least not romance between people. His real love affair is with the sights and sounds of nature which he endows with otherworldly power. Underneath the familiar story in ""The New World"" lies Malicks true subject - the destruction of paradise. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 The idealization of the native American existence in ""The New World"" precolonization is a pleasing fantasy but also timeworn and ahistorical. Surely someone as sophisticated as Malick - who once taught philosophy at MIT and was a Rhodes scholar - understands that he is putting forth a fabrication. He gets away with it because we come to accept his vision The native Americans along with the English interlopers are metaphorical creatures playing out their roles in a pageant about the loss of innocence.The film only works if you accept it on its own symbolic terms. And those terms may not have enough grit for most audiences. Malick is one of the last holdouts from a movie era when it was possible to make films as intuitively as one might write a lyric poem. In a sense thats what all his movies are visual poetry. Their logic is not of drama and character but rather of image and mood.This can be especially frustrating in ""The New World"" because there is a great historical story to be told here and it has never really been done right in the movies. From a strictly narrative point of view the most interesting part of the film comes when Pocahontas now the bride of tobacco grower John Rolfe (Christian Bale) is brought to London to meet the king and queen. We can see how for her London is her own New World and the city as seen through her eyes takes on a terrifyingly beautiful aspect.In moments like these Malick fuses his visual gifts with a true sense of historical purpose.Too often though we dawdle with the protagonists as they muddle through their very photogenic escapades. (The film was trimmed by about 20 minutes at Malicks request after its initial Oscar-qualifying run last year in New York and Los Angeles.)It doesnt help that Farrells Smith looks not so much entranced as just plain zonked. He doesnt have the transcendent personal qualities that this film needs. His blank face gives nothing back. Kilcher is lovely but she has a blankness too. After her first couple of close-ups the camera doesnt discover anything new about her.Still Malick has a gorgeous talent for capturing supernal landscapes for conveying their sorrow and it would be a loss if he stopped directing again at a time when Hollywood is more starved than ever before for the ""personal touch."" We may need him more than he needs us. Grade B Rated PG-13 for some intense battle sequences.Sex/Nudity None. Violence 11 scenes. Profanity None. Drugs/Alcohol/Smoking 1 instance of smoking.

"Rapturous New World casts new light on Americas myths - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Rapturous New World casts new light on Americas myths By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  January 20 2006 The New World"" is something I dont think Ive ever seen before on a movie screen an epic lyrical dialectic. Self-indulgent gorgeous maddening grueling ultimately transcendent its a Terrence Malick movie all the way and possibly the directors most sustained work since 1972s Badlands."" A revisionist telling of the Pocahontas story it also gets its knuckles dirty in the myths that have sustained America since the very first landfall draining them of romance while measuring a new and clear-eyed sense of national identity. It is a thing of wild beauty.And many people will hate it. Historians for one since The New World"" paints an impassioned love story that never actually occurred between the 27-year-old Captain John Smith and the 11-year-old Algonquin girl. Malick is working with the stuff of metaphor; he turns Smith into a rough idealistic dreamboat with the face of Colin Farrell and casts the rangy 15-year-old newcomer Qorianka Kilcher as Pocahontas (even though that name is never once spoken in the film). The girl is all that America promises to an adventurer -- all the hopes of new beginning and noble savagery -- and Smith never sees her for who she is until too late. Thats his tragedy; the movies point is that its probably ours as well.The New World"" is also assuredly not for those who like their epics action-packed and moving with due appointed speed despite arriving in local theaters in a version 20 minutes tighter than the one that premiered in New York in December. As with Days of Heaven"" (1978) and The Thin Red Line"" (1998) Malick has made a sprawling cinematic tone poem that paints the characters thoughts on the soundtrack in the form of inner pensees. This approach has its pretensions (and then some) but when it works the result is a rapture of a sort the movies always promise and almost never deliver.Youll know which camp youre in during the long opening scene a visual crescendo that depicts the arrival of the European ships scored to an intensely beautiful fanfare of horns. The Jamestown colonists are led by Captain Newport (Christopher Plummer) who lands his men issues a few high-flown bromides about destiny and skedaddles back to England for reinforcements.The film proceeds to paint the Europeans first winter with horrific attention to detail Outside the fort is a harsh plentiful wilderness peopled by naturals"" whose bearing customs and language are unfathomable while inside the gates civilization quickly gives way to madness. As usual Malick strands any number of gifted actors in small roles -- Noah Taylor John Savage David Thewlis all come and go -- as he attends to the big picture of Western idealism wrecked on foreign shores. Smith is sent upriver to the Algonquin village to trade for food; the voyage ends with a surreal vision of the captain in full armor fending off attacking warriors while standing knee-deep in a swamp. Hes dragged to the longhouse of Powhatan (August Schellenberg) and prepared for slaughter; Pocahontas does her thing; already were far from Walt Disney and closer to the fierce descriptions of classic historians like Francis Parkman.She falls in love with Smith as adolescent girls do and he falls in love with the idea of her as a romantically inclined explorer might do. They are gentle loving faithful"" the explorer says of the Algonquins lacking in all trickery; they have no jealousy no sense of possession."" Startled to discover theyre human he willfully overlooks the more brutal facts of their existence. Malick does not. He indulges himself here; Emmanuel Lubezkis cinematography is almost painfully lovely and the voice-overs flow in like waves on a lake. Its such a lovely dream and yes it comes to look fairly silly to an outsider -- to Powhatan to the other colonists to the viewers in the audience.But a dream it is and the use of Mozarts 23d Piano Concerto on the soundtrack alerts us to the fact that its a European dream -- John Smiths dream. The New World"" dives deep into the utopian ideal that has coursed through the veins of this country from the Puritans through Herman Melville and Walt Whitman all the way to the hippie dream of the 1960s that noble ruinous vision of a city on the hill and the reinvention of the self that can be found there. Smith believes that vision and is doomed to chase it forever. Terrence Malick may have believed it once -- hes a child of the 60s after all -- but he doesnt anymore as much as he misses its certainty.Smith returns to Jamestown which has degenerated into fearsome squalor and only the arrival of the Algonquins with food keeps the enterprise from collapsing. The first Thanksgiving is thus presented as an act of pity like strangers doing what they can at the site of a car wreck. In the spring war breaks out -- the battle is brutal and quick harder to watch than anything in The Thin Red Line"" -- and when Captain Newport returns Smith goes off to search for the Northwest Passage. Pocahontas has by now been kidnapped and brought to live at the fort. Wait two months and tell the girl Im dead he instructs his followers.Its while watching the scene in which they do just that that you may begin to realize what an extraordinary performance Kilcher is giving. Shes untrained (insofar as any LA teenager who has dabbled in performance can be called untrained) not conventionally pretty (that long long jaw would keep her out of all the raucous youth comedies) holding down a hugely ambitious historical drama and yet the characters emotions seem to float through her face of their own accord. The filter of movie acting"" isnt yet in place in Kilcher; in performance terms she may be more of a noble savage than the woman shes playing. She rises to the occasion though and in the final reels gives Pocahontas the serene gravity of one who understands she has ascended a world stage.New colonists have arrived with Newport and one of them takes an interest in the grieving girl the others regard as someone finished."" Portrayed by Christian Bale John Rolfe is everything John Smith is not steady cautious kindhearted tempered by his own tragedies. If The New World"" were a 1930s movie hed be played by Ralph Bellamy. Malick uses the character though to quietly counterbalance Smith and the relationship the couple cautiously builds is something new more mature. Where Smith wanted to conquer and be conquered by his newfound land Rolfe wants to make it work. He doesnt love Pocahontas as an idea. He loves her as a person.The films final scenes are terribly moving both as metaphor and because Malick has achieved a sense of historys weight. Pocahontas by now converted to Christianity and baptized Rebecca travels to England and is presented at the court of King James I (a cameo by Jonathan Pryce) along with a small menagerie of native American fauna a bald eagle a raccoon despondent in a cage. Dressed in court finery she gazes at the latter and possibly wonders at everything she has lost and gained.By the end of this exhausting astounding drama of a nations very first steps were wondering too.

Colin Farrell and QOrianka Kilcher star as Capt. John Smith and Pocahontas in The New World. New Line Cinema The colonization of Jamestown feels so static that occasionally you get the sense of a photo essay rather than a film. The story which chronicles the clashes between the British settlers and the Native Americans is thin and the scant dialogue often cliched. There are long sequences where all is quiet except for bird cries buzzing insects and claps of thunder. Those natural sounds are preferable to the pretentious narrative musings of the characters. Often the effort to sound poetic in contemplation sounds like high schoolers attempting haiku. ""It was a dream/Now I am awake/I let her love me/I made her love me"" muses Colin Farrell as Capt. John Smith in a one-note performance mostly looking lovesick and helpless. But 15-year-old QOrianka Kilcher as Pocahontas makes an impressive debut. Writer/director Terrence Malick tells the love story of Smith and Pocahontas in his trademark meandering style. Though the visuals are arresting he almost stops the storys flow to train his lens on windswept fields or migrating birds as he did in The Thin Red Line. The ponderous narrative lacks so much focus that it will likely leave most viewers squirming in their seats. (Rated PG-13 for some intense battle sequences. Running time 2 hours 15 minutes. In major markets.)

But between then and its national release now World creator Terrence Malick has trimmed some 15 minutes for what publicists have positioned as the movies ""theatrical"" version (135 minutes) as opposed to the ""Academy"" version (150 minutes). Position away O ye spinners The good news for all who are not awards voters is that this newer shorter World -- shorter anyway in the category of languid movies over two hours -- is that it communicates Malicks luminous artistic vision of innocence and loss wildness and order risks taken and chances lost with more clarity than his first cut. Many of us would follow the filmmaker of Days of Heaven and The Thin Red Line anywhere standing patiently by (even if our attention drifts) while he scans the horizon with his artists spyglass. Now we can add this magnificent (and magnificently flawed) specimen to a prized collection of Malick movies that explore what it means to be an American. We can also discuss all over again whether an artists work is ever done. The uncharted land of possibility and danger on which the filmmaker meditates is Jamestown Va. first discovered by English explorers in 1607 but long familiar to the indigenous people -- the Europeans called them ""Naturals"" -- hunting farming and thriving there. Its on this stretch of what feels like Eden to tired men clad in cumbersome armor -- the water full of fish the earth fertile with corn -- that John Smith (Colin Farrell) lands in chains a rebellious soldier of fortune awaiting hanging for insubordination to his commander (Christopher Plummer). Its also in this uncharted terra that Smith is pardoned given a second chance in a new climate and dispatched to meet with the ruling chieftain Powhatan (August Schellenberg) and negotiate for supplies. For Smith remarking to himself in an internal diarylike voice-over -- as much an identifiable characteristic of Malicks gloriously stubborn personal sensual filmmaking style as the sight of leaves blowing in the wind -- dazzling newness abounds He thinks Powhatans entrancing teenage daughter (Qorianka Kilcher) noticed frolicking with her brother in the tall grass is the most bewitching vision of untamed loveliness he has ever seen. The New World never mentions her name but history knows the girl as Pocahontas. Of course to this entrancingly guileless young woman (Kilcher 14 years old at her debut performance appears herself to be a self-possessed young woman of ravishing beauty and openness) her own people are as familiar as the old sun and moon while its Smith who twinkles like a new star. Out of such elemental attraction cross-cultural bonding and heartbreaking complication comes a love story with consequences that stand for civilization and its discontents as well. Out of Pocahontas eventual marriage to the kind widowed Englishman John Rolfe (Christian Bale) and the unpredictability with which she chooses whether to wear shoes like a proper lady or go barefoot like a sprite comes a fresh new definition of early America. Many have tried but none can match Malicks touch for shuffling a deck of elegiac images (water/sky/clouds/rain) and fanning out the hand to express what speech cannot; hes a master too of incorporating sound that is often wordless but never empty. (As Old World civilization sails into the harbor of the new Malick hears the horns of Wagners Das Rheingold; when Smith and Pocahontas explore one another the movie does for Mozarts Piano Concerto No. 23 what Elvira Madigan did for his Piano Concerto No. 21.) Still with storytelling so tremulous and impressionistic 5 or 10 seconds trimmed from this scene and that accrue to shake out big wrinkles in narrative time. Whats fascinating about the ""theatrical"" New World is that I can feel but not see a difference between one version and the other with no sense of Malickian languor lost. Farrell a vibrant substantive actor with eyes unfazed by silence is given plenty of space to establish his Smith as a man not equipped despite all his sensitivity for greatness in love or exploit; contrasted against such moodiness Bale creates a man whose patience is as attractive as Smiths passion. Malick presents the Native Americans with a deep feeling for their majesty as well as for their fearsome mystery in the eyes of the new visitors. This map feels righter and more in perspective than that of the first I saw just weeks ago. But wait Malick has announced hell release an even longer three-hour cut on DVD. Having laid eyes on this brave New World its here Ill stay.

Warning All but die-hards should call the travel agent and change itineraries. Colin Farrell stars as Jamestown founder Capt. John Smith whom Pocahontas famously saved from execution. New Line Cinema What transpires is not very pretty -- though because this is John Smith and Pocahontas meeting the cult director of Days of Heaven the visuals sometimes are. And for a while were not even totally certain that the movie is going to be 21/2 hours of dramatic inertia. Early scenes introducing a sea crew of British settlers that include Smith (Colin Farrell forsaking his frequent stubble for a real beard) show tentative promise. Sailing from England under Smiths fellow captain (Christopher Plummer) they land in Virginia in 1607 and we quickly get a sense of what it must have been like for these men and the locals (called ""naturals"") to sniff each other out. But this is kind of what the movie is marathon sniffing. Smith is a cipher as screen heroes go and its not all Farrells fault. At least the King of England gives the settlers some tools. About the movie The New World   1/2 Stars Colin Farrell Qorianka Kilcher Christian Bale Christopher Plummer Wes Studhi David Thewlis Director Terrence Malick Distributor New Line Cinema Rating PG-13 for some intense battle sequences Running time 2 hours 30 minutes Opens Sunday in New York and Los Angeles After long languorous passages something stirring will happen hand-to-hand combat the grubby spectacle of humbly carved-out domiciles to show that Heaven art director Jack Fisk still knows his stuff. But newcomer Qorianka Kilcher is woefully inexpressive as Pocahontas and though the actress looks older she was 14 during filming so there go any hopes of even attempted erotic passion. For those up to the burden Malick typically puts one in an alternate universe and provides flashes of magic. Pocahontas catching us off-guard with an impromptu cartwheel isnt the knock-you-down brainstorm of Naomi Watts juggling for King Kong but its still deliciously inspired. Trouble is the bit lasts two seconds while the movie is a long ""might have been"" thats doomed to be buried in a flurry of strong late-year releases.

Its the only truth. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - --dialogue from The New WorldThe stars of the new Terrence Malick picture The New World -- regular members of his stock company all -- are tall grass blowing in the wind sunlight reflected off still waters and crickets chirping at dusk. And no those arent the names of the Powhatan Indians who populate this story of the 17th-century explorer John Smith the woman called Pocahontas and America itself in its infancy. Malick is an anomaly -- the Hollywood director who finds greater stimulation in nature than inside a CG paint box who prefers green to green screens. And like every movie he has made over the last 32 years (all three of them) this one exudes a rapturous sensual beauty. Discussing The New World after the screening a friend proposed that Malicks imagery makes you want to run up and touch the screen. But no thats not quite right; its more like the images are touching you. It would seem easy to dismiss Malick (as many have) as the maker of pretty pictures but the beauty in Malicks work is more than skin deep. Its as though were being transported to a place before time began or at least before we were first cast out of that proverbial garden. Which is precisely the point. No matter their official subjects Malicks first three movies (Badlands Days of Heaven and The Thin Red Line) were all mournful paeans to paradises lost innocences violated and savageries tamed. The New World is no exception only this time the Eden in question is literally America and the locust in her wheat field is none other than the imperialist invader. Had Malick made this film in the 1970s when he originally wrote it it doubtless would have been seen as some kind of response to a certain misbegotten American military action in the East. Three decades on the more things change the more they stay the same. So I wish The New World were better. Certainly it is not without its glories The early scenes in which Smith (Colin Farrell) and the three ships commissioned by the London Virginia Company arrive on the shores of the James River to the stirrings of Wagner on the soundtrack have a primitivistic intensity; we feel as though we like Smith (and Malick for that matter) are seeing this land for the first time each blade of grass distinct from the next each patch of sky a unique shade of blue. Then ""the naturals"" appear in their shimmering brown skins as exotic to the British as the British are to them. Its intoxicating stuff not least because with the exception of a few passages of voice-over narration hardly a line of dialogue is spoken. The British and the Indians cant speak of course -- at least not to each other -- but its something more than that. Malick seems to have grown fatigued of words to believe that the deepest feelings in cinema might be expressed some other way. Yet where the best films of Malick and of those directors driven by similar ambitions -- Claire Denis Abbas Kiarostami and Carroll Ballard to name just three -- strike a delicate balance between the poetic and the prosaic The New World is a movie less interested in expanding the boundaries of narrative cinema than in forsaking them. Though Ive admired Malicks previous films Ive never fully bought into the argument -- having as much to do with the years in which he wasnt making movies as those when he was -- that hes some kind of genius. If nothing else The New World offers compelling evidence that Malick himself may have succumbed to the hype. The movie is less a historical drama punctuated by ecstatic landscapes than a stunning landscape film that pauses every once in a while to tell a story. And whenever it does its as if a giant vacuum comes along and sucks all the life out of the picture. Of course there were indications as far back as Days of Heaven that he might be a better director of insects than of actors but The New World is the first of Malicks movies in which the dialogue scenes are completely inert; its as if he cant be bothered. The scenes feel like concessions to the studio for what Malick really seems to want to do is to make an abstract study of figures and environments like the films of the experimental filmmakers James Benning and Peter Hutton. If he could hed just as soon do without things like characters and plot and The New World would probably be a more successful movie for it. A lot happens in The New World Smith and a party of his men set out to meet with the feared Powhatan chief (August Schellenberg) and are ambushed en route; those who stay behind to build the colony that will become Jamestown are ravaged by starvation and disease; eventually more settlers arrive and civilization rears its ugly head. But the only thing Malick shows much interest in is the blossoming relationship between Smith and the daughter of the Powhatan chief Pocahontas (14-year-old Qorianka Kilcher) who saves Smith from imminent execution and spends most of the movies next hour frolicking with him in the forest and teaching him to paint with all the colors of the wind. The rest of the characters scarcely possess names let alone personalities and the movie feels like a particularly cruel betrayal of the actors who have dutifully followed Malick up the river and into the jungle -- some of whom (like Ben Chaplin Noah Taylor and Brian F. OByrne) have been reduced to blink-and-youll-miss-them cameos a la Adrien Brody in The Thin Red Line while others (like Christian Bale who makes a third-act entrance as Pocahontas husband-to-be John Rolfe) seem utterly bewildered about their purpose in being there. Though the famous ""romance"" between Smith and Pocahontas (who was likely no more than 12 years old at the time) is more fiction than fact its easy to see why Malick has chosen to go in that direction. Malicks Pocahontas is more than just another in his gallery of wide-eyed virginal innocents (including Sissy Spacek in Badlands and Linda Manz in Days of Heaven) -- shes Mother Earth herself and as played by the extraordinary newcomer Kilcher she seems the embodiment of all that is pure and good about the natural world. As lissome as the grass itself she could be Malicks dream woman. And Smith for all his benevolent intentions is her despoiler. Just one week on from Peter Jacksons behemoth this is King Kong all over again only with the gender roles reversed. Historical fidelity notwithstanding the scheme of The New World is all too easy to read that Pocahontas will become a pawn in the increasingly violent territorial battles between the Indians and the British. That she will like America herself become domesticated -- her sun-kissed body bound up in a corset her bare feet squeezed awkwardly into high heels -- and paraded before all of England as an exotic offering. That she will die a symbolic death far from her native land. Well before The New Worlds two-and-one-half hours are up Malicks tree-hugging reveries have become suffocating no matter the unquestionable tastefulness with which theyre rendered -- more painterly vistas more Wagner (and a little Mozart too) ravishing re-creations of 17th-century London. Surely only a Philistine could find any fault with this or believe perchance that Malicks famous poetic beauty had turned poetically fatal.

"New World The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; new-world-the ) New World The (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli When last we encountered Pocahontas in movie-land she had been Disney-fied to allow children to experience a sanitized version of her adventures. While theres nothing wrong with Pocahontas (except the history that is) Terrence Malick is going for something more poetic and visually plush not to mention using a narrative that sticks closer to the established facts. The New World takes liberties with what really happened but its more adult and true in its account than the Disney version. This film is beautiful to look at but that should come as no surprise. Malick has always been known as a painter who uses celluloid as his canvas. His films breathe and move slowly. Patience is a mandatory trait for those desiring not to be bored. I have not always been a fan of the directors style. I liked The Thin Red Line but parts bored me and I was less than impressed by Days of Heaven. For the most part I found The New World to be absorbing. There was not a lot of watch watching. Without compromising his style Malick manages to develop an interesting account and provide insight into the emotions of the leads. If only he had eliminated the voiceoversa| The New World is a misnomer since it leads one to believe that the film is going to be about the struggles of European colonists establishing settlements in the Americas during the 1600s. While thats admittedly part of the narrative its not the biggest part. This is really the story of Pocahontas (QOrianka Kilcher) the Native American princess who provided aid to the settlers of Virginia fell in love with Captain John Smith (Colin Farrell) was exiled by her father and became the dutiful wife of tobacconist John Rolfe (Christian Bale). The New World tells two different kinds of love stories the youthful passion of Pocahontas coupling with the dashing-but-unreliable Smith and her more mature relationship with the stable loving Rolfe. All of this occurs against the backdrop of the uneasy relationship that exists between the tribes of ""naturals"" and the English interlopers. Much of the films first hour reminded me of Dances with Wolves. Smith sent as an emissary to Powhatan (August Schellenberg) the chief of the Algonquian Indians is seduced by the lifestyle and the chiefs 12-year old daughter. (She seems older in the movie probably to ward off pedophilia charges against Smith.) During these sequences we see the gradual development of a romance (although the historical record indicates that their relationship while close was more that of a father and daughter). With Malick not rushing things these two fall in love slowly and naturally. However once Smith returns to Jamestown the idyll is shattered. They meet numerous times after their summer together but growing tensions between the Algonquin and the Englishmen limit their freedom to interact and Smiths internal conflict about their relationship leads to him to accept a commission from the King to explore for a northern passage to the Indies. After Smith is gone John Rolfe enters the picture. He is devoted to Pocahontas even though she still mourns Smiths departure and apparent death. In many ways this romance though less traditional is more interesting. In order to be with Rolfe Pocahontas must give up her dreams of the road not taken and accept the good things that life has placed in front of her. Like many of us she learns that the first love while often the most heated and intense can burn out quickly and has no future. Malick brings this home. Theres no doubt that the cinematography is showy. It highlights the natural beauty of the scenery and often lingers on faces. (Everything except scenes requiring visual effects was shot in 65 mm making this the first movie since Kenneth Branaghs Hamlet to employ the expensive stock.) The New World is an effective mix of visual poetry and prose. It has the power to captivate. The ambient soundtrack featuring the noises of an unspoiled land is also effective. Unfortunately Malick chooses to add internal monologues from Smith Pocahontas and Rolfe. Not only are these florid voiceovers badly written but they are intrusive and hurt the flow of the movie. In addition they are redundant. Everything thats said in them is expressed by the actors through facial expressions gestures and actions. This isnt a minor flaw - its a major impediment to enjoying the movie. In addition there are times when James Horners score comes across as too loud. Colin Farrell is adequate although the Irish brogue is distracting. His best work is in his last scene which requires him to be introspective and regretful. Christian Bale gives his usual fine performance but he only appears in the films final 45 minutes. Newcomer QOrianka Kilcher displays more maturity than her 14 years (the age at which she began filming) would suggest. She is consistently good and has an expressive face. The supporting cast includes the always reliable Christopher Plummer as Captain Christopher Newport veteran Native American actor Wes Studi (The Last of the Mohicans Dances with Wolves) as one of Powhatans warriors and Irene Bedard as Pocahontas mother. Bedards inclusion is interesting since she supplied the speaking voice of the title character in Disneys Pocahontas. Its hard to say whether this is coincidence or an acknowledgment by Malick. The New World is likely one of those films that viewers will either embrace or hold at arms length. Malick often has that effect. If youre in the mood for something reflective and visually sumptuous this movie will have you enraptured before the 30 minute mark. If youre less patient youll be squirming in your seat. The New World is beautiful and lyrical and except for the ill-advised voiceovers a treat for more than one of the senses. And it tells stories about characters in situations worth caring about. Its a worthy effort and recommended viewing for those who have interest.

While the tale of first contact between Englishmen and the ""naturals"" might seem to play to the strengths of the director Malicks exalted visuals and isolated metaphysical epiphanies are ill-supported by a muddled lurching narrative resulting in a sprawling unfocused account of an epochal historical moment. The skies surrounding Jamestown in ""The New World"" are almost invariably flat and colorless a condition that unfortunately also describes the storytelling and dramatis personae in Terrence Malicks new picture. While the tale of first contact between Englishmen and the ""naturals"" as the Brits felicitously refer to the Native Americans might seem to play to the strengths of the meticulous and unhurried director Malicks exalted visuals and isolated metaphysical epiphanies are ill-supported by a muddled lurching narrative resulting in a sprawling unfocused account of an epochal historical moment. The support of Malick loyalists notwithstanding New Line will have trouble generating more than a modest commercial response. ""The New World"" is just Malicks fourth film in a career that began 32 years ago with ""Badlands."" No one elses films look like his and Disney to the side no filmmaker has ever chosen to take a serious look at the initial English incursion onto American soil a period invariably encrusted by starch and must in history books. Malick brings palpably alive the physical manifestations of the British presence in Virginia beginning in 1607. Stirringly beginning with the opening strains of Wagners ""Das Rheingold"" written to evoke a rivers swirling and the emanation of life from it the film presents without preamble the arrival of three British ships like a cascading wave upon the shore. Without a clue what to expect the Englishmen remain cautiously reserved as the naturals scamper about hoot talk and even sniff and touch them before retreating back into the sylvan wilds. Sequence has a freshly charged even humorous aspect that holds considerable promise. White contingent is led by Captain Newport (Christopher Plummer) who as he strides upon the land summarily releases Captain John Smith (Colin Farrell) from his death sentence (for unexplained ""mutinous remarks"") and appoints him to lead an expedition to the natives compound. Along the way the other men are killed while Smith is captured only to spared at the last minute by Pocahontas (Qorianka Kilcher) the teenage daughter of the Powhatan tribal king (August Schellenberg). The months that follow constitute the heart of the matter for Malick. In each of his films but especially in ""Days of Heaven"" and the early section of ""The Thin Red Line"" the director has excelled at evoking nature in its pure state from the sensual swaying of grass and wheat in the former to the intoxicating qualities of the tropics in the latter. Here there is an Adam-and-Eve-like quality to the playful sensual but not precisely carnal frolicking of Pocahontas (Kilcher was 14 when pic was shot) and the Englishman twice her age who falls under the spell of a culture so very different from his own. Although the storyline has been fictionalized at least in regard to the romance between the leading characters the filmmakers have gone to great lengths to achieve authenticity on the production side. Lensing along the Chickahominy River very close to the original Jamestown settlement Malick production designer Jack Fisk costume designer Jacqueline West and all other hands have fashioned a convincing version of indigenous American life 400 years ago that has a gratifyingly hand-tooled feel. When Fort James is first seen its ugliness truly resembles a scar upon the land. But the films impact begins and disappointingly ends with these tactile impressionistic effects. Minimalizing dialogue in favor of mostly unilluminating voice-over narration from Smith Pocahontas and later newly arrived Englishman John Rolfe screenwriter Malick (who first penned the script 25 years ago) cant get inside the heads of any of his characters and fails to establish a connection for the audience. While Kilchers girl/woman charm poised naivete and intriguing unfamiliarity lend Pocahontas a considerable fascination Smith remains grievously underwritten for a leading role. One hasnt a clue what drives him what he might have left behind in England whether or not hes a trustworthy character (or narrator) with a good heart. Under the circumstances Farrell cant do much more than interact in an agreeably spontaneous way with his leading lady. Thesps in lesser roles register hardly at all. Pocahontas is said to have been one of many children of the king but there is no attempt to delineate the native groups family or power structure or this tribes relationship with its neighbors. Explicit exposition may not be Malicks thing but the lack of moorings has the predictable effect of leaving the viewer adrift in what shapes up as the directors most literal albeit not overly didactic depiction of the despoiling of Eden. Before long pic falls into an ill-formed midsection marked by muddled action abrupt transitions and a lulling torpor. With Newport having sailed back to England for more supplies and manpower the English settlement languishes but revives upon Smiths return. Once Powhatan figures out that the Brits plan to stay he prepares for battle with them. Hes foiled however by his favorite daughter who warns Smith leading to her exile from the tribe and adoption by the English. Just as Smiths embrace of native ways made for unusual moments so does Pocahontas slow Anglicanization stir modest interest although in a sadder way with her natural manner literally constricted by the European clothes she wears. Told Smith is dead she at lengthmarries tobacco grower Rolfe (Christian Bale) who later takes her to his homeland. This development momentarily proves stimulating as Malick is wonderfully adept at showing England from an innocents point of view with its dark wet stone and formal gardens contrasting starkly with the new worlds lush land and untamed foliage. Along with the dramatic shortcomings pic surprisingly disappoints somewhat on the visual side as well. To be sure Malick and ace cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki have come up with some arresting original and mobile images. But the combination of the overwhelmingly dull skies with the decision to film entirely without electric lights serves to drain a lot of the color and interest from the frames especially compared to what the director achieved in ""Days of Heaven"" and ""The Thin Red Line."" In the end there is also a feeling of pictorial repetition of what Malick has done before particularly in the reliance on nature shots; more than once one is made to recall the old saw about how if a scene isnt cutting together you cut to a seagull flying overhead. With this and the heavy narration one senses a certain artistic treading water the opposite of what the churning waterborne motifs of ""Das Rheingold"" are meant to suggest. The repeated Wagner excerpt remains the dominant musical signpost of the film much as the Saint-Saens ""Carnival of the Animals"" extract was for ""Days of Heaven."" Among other pre-existing music Mozart plays a leading role and James Horners original contributions to the score are discreet and dramatic. The New WorldProductionA New Line Cinema release.
