"Chasing Liberty Eluding Enjoyment washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Chasing Liberty Eluding Enjoyment Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday January 9 2004 An endless virtually laugh-free pastiche of Aaron Sorkin by way of Aaron Spelling ""Chasing Liberty"" features Mandy Moore trying so strenuously to be the next Americas Sweetheart that she almost pops a vein. Moore plays Anna Foster the 18-year-old daughter of the U.S. president portrayed here by Mark Harmon in what ""West Wing"" fans will find a mind-bending performance (wasnt he Secret Service a few seasons back? Didnt he die? Is that C.J. hes calling right now?). Tired of her cosseted life Anna breaks free of her overprotective dad and her Secret Service detail during the G-8 summit in Europe; she takes up with a sober but hunky Brit (Matthew Goode) who turns out to have more of an interest in her than she thinks. Lethargically directed by Andy Cadiff who works from a tired script by Derek Guiley and David Schneiderman ""Chasing Liberty"" gets off to an unpromising start with a Clinton administration joke that fell as flat with a recent preview audience as it does on-screen with White House security guards. From there the movie takes bits from the aforementioned ""Wing"" bits from ""Roman Holiday"" and a smidgen from ""Two for the Road"" -- leaving all the punch romance and style of those titles on the highways and byways of Europe. Moore blows out her cheeks and slits her eyes as a good girl trying hard to be bad; it isnt terribly convincing. The filmmakers have made a real find though in Goode who brings the appeal of a budding Hugh Grant but with a bit more gravitas. There are some yummy shots of Prague and Venice as the two traipse across Europe their junket culminating in Goodes character saving the First Midriff from a horde of taunting Europeans. At this point ""Chasing Liberty"" turns into an all-too-plausible horror film. Make it stop Chasing Liberty (111 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for sexual content and brief nudity.

(AP Photo/Jaap Buitendijk) Mandy Moore and Matthew Goode star in Alcon Entertainments young adult romantic comedy ""Chasing Liberty."" (AP Photo/Jaap Buitendijk) Photo JAAP BUITENDIJK Mandy Moore rises above cute in Liberty 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Chasing Liberty Romantic comedy. Starring Mandy Moore Matthew Goode and Mark Harmon. Directed by Andy Cadiff. (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Its no longer enough to say that Mandy Moore is a better actress than Britney Spears or any other teen idol pop star. Its getting time to say that Mandy Moore is an actress one who listens and thinks and looks like a real person not an antiseptic princess. She takes a role in ""Chasing Liberty"" that if played by someone else -- say Jessica Alba -- might have been used as an occasion for ingratiating gestures. Moore invests it with quick intelligence and emotional readiness and the entire picture is elevated. She plays Anna the daughter of a U.S. president in the midst of his second term and just to make sure that half the audience doesnt hate her on principle the president (Mark Harmon) is patterned on neither Clinton nor Bush II. Actually President Foster seems a little like Howard Dean in that he speaks in complete sentences and barely ever cracks a smile. The president has a country to run and unlike Theodore Roosevelt who understood he could either run the United States or his young daughter President Foster tries to keep a tight grip on 18-year-old Annas comings and goings. Whats immediately apparent -- and refreshing -- about ""Chasing Liberty"" is that it doesnt play cute with its premise. The first scene shows the elaborate security involved in the first daughters going on a dinner date. The young man is all but strip-searched on his way onto the White House grounds and a caravan of agents follows their car to the restaurant. As they eat everyone stares. The movie establishes quickly that this is a suffocating way to grow up and an impossible way for a vivacious girl to come into her young womanhood. Anna longs to cut loose but shes not so ambitious as to try to run away -- that is not until she goes with her father to Prague and he betrays a promise he made to her. Typical politician. He tells her she can go to a show accompanied by only two agents but she soon realizes she is surrounded by them. She makes a break for it and hooks up with Ben (Matthew Goode) a British photographer motorcycling through Europe. ""Chasing Liberty"" is a kind of remake of ""It Happened One Night"" (1934) updated and retooled for a young audience that wont recognize the connection. There are faint allusions to the famous hitchhiking scene and to the bedroom scene in which the two sleep with a partition between them. Like Claudette Colbert Moore plays a young heiress on the run. And Ben like the Clark Gable character in the original version is charged with bringing her back. Unknown to Anna hes a Secret Service agent too Her father has decided to let Anna have the illusion of rebellion but in perfect safety. Anna and Ben romp through Prague and later Venice having adventures and misadventures and meeting various colorful characters and its all quite engaging. We understand what this freedom means to Anna partly thanks to Moores expressive intelligence but also through director Andy Cadiffs technique. We see a rock concert a late-night outdoor screening of an operatic film and the splendors of historic cities through the eyes of a young girl experiencing them for the first time. Everything is injected with a sense of exuberance and unfolding life. And it all seems an analogue for Annas blossoming sexual awareness which is handled with frankness and good taste both of which are a surprise. The movies one sour note a minor one but it grates is its depiction of the Venetians specifically a gondolier and his mother who are presented as the sort of happy hysterics one might find in a spaghetti sauce commercial. In fact Venetians are if anything reserved and shrewd and gondoliers are particularly crafty customers. The filmmakers shot ""Chasing Liberty"" on location and had the real people staring them in the face. Why persist in the condescending stereotype when the truth is more interesting? Advisory This film contains discreet nudity and sexual situations.

Its an innocuous occasionally cute movie made watchable by the appealing Mandy Moore and hunky Matthew Goode a Brit who has a bit of Hugh Grant charm in an otherwise silly role. (Related item Matthew Goode chasing fame) First daughter Mandy Moore throws caution to the wind when she hops on a motorcycle with a dashing Brit in Chasing Liberty. Warner Bros. via AP Unlike Britney Spears another songbird who has tried her hand at acting Moore actually has talent and a modicum of smarts to accompany her adorable persona. She just hasnt found the right material to showcase her talents choosing instead sappy romances such as A Walk to Remember and the earnest teen flick How to Deal. Chasing Liberty centers on Anna the 18-year-old daughter of the president who longs to escape the watchful eyes of Secret Service agents and live a little. Her protective dad is played capably if a bit dully by Mark Harmon. Her mother (Caroline Goodall) tries to champion her daughters freedom but she is ineffectual in swaying the leader of the Western world. But the movie is supposed to belong to Anna. About the movie Chasing Liberty  (out of four) Stars Mandy Moore Hark Harmon Matthew Goode Director Andy Cadiff Distibutor Warner Bros Rating PG-13 for sexual content and brief nudity Opens nationwide Friday Anna though shes perky and cute has had few suitors thanks to her dads high-profile job. When she accompanies her parents on a state visit to Prague she performs all her ceremonial duties then cuts loose by hopping a train to Berlin and the ""Love Parade"" a sort of Woodstock-meets-Mardi Gras love-in. She falls for a cute stranger (Goode) and mayhem and romance ensue. Some moments will remind moviegoers of the awful The Lizzie Maguire Movie particularly when Moore hops on the back of a strangers motorcycle and zips around a romantic European city. Perhaps those montages are cinematic code for teenage rebelliousness. This is a movie made for fans of last years What a Girl Wants. It comes from the same producers Broderick Johnson and Andrew Kosove who presented last months Love Dont Cost a Thing starring Nick Cannon (who like Moore deserves better material). Perhaps these producers should think about forgoing the insipid teen comedies for movies more like their first venture the wonderful My Dog Skip.

Inoffensive adolescent escapism laced with surprising amounts of genuine charm pic should hold its own in the barren field of high-profile January releases posting mid-range numbers close to Moores 2002 hit ""A Walk to Remember."" The third film in as many years to topline singing sensation Mandy Moore ""Chasing Liberty"" is a teenybopper ""Roman Holiday."" Its the first of two competing studio pics originally titled ""First Daughter"" both scheduled for the same release date and both springing from the exact same premise. (The other project from Fox still titled ""First Daughter"" was bumped to release later this year.) Inoffensive adolescent escapism laced with surprising amounts of genuine charm pic should hold its own in the barren field of high-profile January releases posting mid-range numbers closer to Moores 2002 hit ""A Walk to Remember"" than her 2003 underperformer ""How to Deal."" Featuring Mark Harmon and Caroline Goodall as a president and first lady decidedly more Bill-and-Hillary than George-and-Laura ""Chasing Liberty"" centers around an age-old parent-child quandary How to strike an appropriate balance between the self-reliance young adults seek and the protection parents still feel obliged to provide them. Eighteen-year-old Anna (Moore) is constantly followed by a throng of Secret Service agents and recognized everywhere she goes by hordes of adoring fans. And although she does a pretty good job of handling the pressure she longs for a romantic evening with a boyfriend sans security or fans. When a G8 summit in Prague occasions something resembling a family vacation Anna begs her dad to allow her while in Europe to attend the Berlin Love Parade with her friend the French ambassadors tongue-pierced daughter Gabrielle (spunky Beatrice Rosen). But when that proposal fails she and Gabrielle begin planning Annas escape. In the crowded bathroom of a hot loud Prague nightclub the two swap Annas clothes with those belonging to a passed-out drunk and give the slip to the agents. Anna disappears into the night on the back of a Vespa driven by a dashing knight-in-leather jacket who just happens to be standing at the clubs entrance. Though Annas savior Ben (Matthew Goode) introduces himself as a photographer traveling through Europe its revealed to viewers quite early on that he is in fact a British-based field agent for the Secret Service. Of course Ben has been assigned to secretly look after Anna and just in case things go awry -- as they inevitably do -- the president also assigns two of Annas regular protectors the bickering Weiss (Jeremy Piven) and Morales (Annabella Sciorra) to keep their eyes on Ben. When Anna and Ben accidentally board the wrong train for Berlin (while Weiss and Morales board the correct one) ""Chasing Liberty"" morphs into a travelogue of Western Europe with stops in Italy Austria and Germany allowing Ben ample time to really fall for Anna. Its all very familiar stuff courtesy of tyro screenwriters Derek Guiley and David Schneiderman who claim to have been inspired by seeing Chelsea Clinton hounded by the media while attending a Stanford basketball game (though surely some credit is also due Irving Berlin who dramatized a not-dissimilar dilemma in the song ""The Secret Service Makes Me Nervous"" from his 1962 musical ""Mr. President""). But the movie works despite overstaying its welcome by about 20 minutes largely because of the chemistry between the naturally charismatic Moore and the effortlessly debonair Goode making his bigscreen debut in a role Sean Connery might have played in his 20s. Though Piven and Sciorra lend generous support their patter has a decidedly scripted rehearsed feel to it. Like the recent ""Freaky Friday"" pic also manages to maintain an appealingly even-keel temperament sympathizing with the frustrations of both parents and children. Of course its also a movie in which the worst potential horrors awaiting an 18-year-old girl traveling unaccompanied through Europe are comical pickpockets and daredevil bungee-jumpers. On the other hand though it may give some parents pause the movie is decidedly more honest in its depiction of teen consumption of alcohol -- particularly overseas where the legal drinking ages are lower -- than most American teen pics where the characters are either cookie-cutter straight or raging delinquents. Pic gets a huge boost from its location shooting throughout Europe particularly in Prague which so often (due to low shooting costs) doubles for other Euro cities but which here beautifully plays itself. Second-time feature director Andy Cadiff (who previously helmed the ""Leave It to Beaver"" movie after a long background in TV directing) does a serviceable professional job that lacks the overall energy or imagination that might have further distinguished the film. Kudos however to music supervisors Maggie Rodford and Jon Leshay for breaking up the soundtracks boy-band monotony with a little Offenbach.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr C+ Chasing Liberty Genre Comedy; Starring Matthew Goode Mandy Moore Mark Harmon Jeremy Piven Annabella Sciorra; Director Andy Cadiff; Author Derek Guiley David Schneiderman; Release Date Wide 01/09/2004; Runtime (in minutes) 111; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted January 7 2004 -- 1200 AM EST Now is the winter of our disconnect when the moviegoing choices are either big-ticket releases missed over the holidays foreign-language films recommended by friends who live in bigger movie towns or lobbed commercial snowballs like Chasing Liberty made to splat quickly before next weeks volley of post-New Years mush. How wet is this meltable young-adult light romance which stars Mandy Moore as the cutest fictional daughter of a sitting U.S. president were likely to see until Katie Holmes takes up the position with ""First Daughter"" later in the year? So wet that Moores Anna Foster the Chelsea Clinton-inspired only child of a photogenic President (Mark Harmon) is introduced doing that thing that all teenage girls do in movies that are too lazy to figure out what teenage girls actually do dancing around her bedroom in innocent imitation of provocative rock-star poses and applying lip gloss. The twist of course is that Annas girlie bedroom is in the White House. Anna is protected by Secret Service agents at all times. (In the premise-setting opening scene a nice young fellow with the wherewithal to ask her out is quickly defeated by the weirdness of dating under surveillance.) And so frustrated by her lack of independence Anna makes a break for it while on a European diplomatic tour with her family. With the help of Ben Calder (Matthew Goode) a cute English guy with a Vespa she meets on the street she shimmies into an innocent imitation of provocative rock-star clothing shakes off her security detail and hits the road. From Prague to Venice to Berlin - its an American girls own ""Roman Holiday"" with pop star Moore as Audrey Hepburn sort of with lip gloss and British stage actor Goode as Gregory Peck sort of with a backpack Ill get to the substantial charms of Mr. Goode in a minute passing by the insubstantial ethnic-romantic-screwball subplot between Jeremy Piven and Annabella Sciorra as unusually bumbling Secret Service agents assigned to Annas protection. (""Liberty"" is the First Daughters code name just as ""whatever"" is the movies genre category.) But can we pause for a minute here and talk about lip acting and its place in girl movies? Lip acting is what happens when an actress of slender dramatic means - Moore say - chews her kisser to denote demure hesitation or sincere thought or shy romantic interest. Lip acting is the telegraphing and stylizing of intention so that the one doing the lip gnaw can simulate anxiety sexuality or anger without actually owning the grown-up feelings. (Sometimes this is enhanced by sweater acting which involves the tugging of overlong sleeves.) Well Moore goes into lip overtime in a tortured scene in which Anna who has not told Ben her identity tries to seduce him and he - a gentleman who for that matter has not exactly told her his story - chivalrously averts his eyes all so that Anna can announce ""Naked virgin safely in bed."" Im just saying. (The naked-virgin script is by newcomers Derek Guiley and David Schneiderman directed by former ""Home Improvement"" producer-director Andy Cadiff.) At least some Goode may come from ""Chasing Liberty"" I hope well be seeing more of the handsome and unboyish young man with big star potential who looks ready to take on more not Moore. In a drippy story about a girl who needs more protecting than she knows this discovery with his charm from the Hugh Grant school and substance a la Ben Chaplin breaks from the motorcade and emerges as a viable candidate for freedom from staged photo ops like this one.

"Chasing Liberty | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; chasing-liberty ) Chasing Liberty (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli Chasing Liberty is a fairly standard-issue teen romantic comedy. Its primary intent is to follow the accepted rules and what at first seems to be an intriguing premise turns into something more formulaic than some might hope. On the other hand for those who like cute boy-meets-girl stories and are in the mood for some light unpretentious romance Chasing Liberty catches its prey. For what it is it works. In addition to being the years first romantic comedy (the designation may be a misnomer since very little about Chasing Liberty is intended to be funny) this film is also a Mandy Moore vehicle. Moore is an interesting individual. Shes attractive and has an undeniable screen presence. But her acting talent is raw. She can do cute and sprightly with no problem but when the script requires that she show deeper emotions she runs into trouble. Fortunately Chasing Liberty keeps those moments to a minimum. Moore is no Natalie Portman or Christina Ricci but shes light years ahead of other singer-turned-actress wannabes like Britney Spears and Beyonce Knowles. Chasing Liberty starts at a more elevated level than the typical teen romance. Anna Foster (Moore) is not an average 18-year old girl dealing with baby fat zits and raging hormones. Shes the daughter of second-term President James Foster (Mark Harmon) and has spent her entire teenage life in the White House surrounded by her fathers political cronies and the ever-present Secret Service. She craves privacy and normalcy - two things that are denied to her because of her fathers vocation. Early in the movie as director Andy Cadiff (a veteran TV director of more than 20 years and two-dozen shows plus the feature film Leave it to Beaver) explores this kind of life (Anna seems part Chelsea Clinton and part Bush twins) there are some interesting moments. But as movies of this sort are wont to do Chasing Liberty quickly distances itself from the real world by establishing itself as a modern-day fairy tale. Anna runs away from home - sort of. While attending a chaperoned concert in Prague she momentarily escapes from her ""captors"" with the help of a dashing British chap named Ben Calder (Matthew Goode). It turns out that Ben is actually a Secret Service agent incognito only Anna doesnt know that. She thinks hes just a good-looking guy she ran into by accident. The President concocts a scheme that will let Anna experience rebellion without being in any real danger. He orders Ben to keep his identity secret and to stay with Anna and brings in two other agents - Weiss (Jeremy Piven) and Morales (Annabella Sciorra) - to keep tabs on her. The trip goes from the streets of Prague to the canals of Venice to the roads of Austria before ending up in Berlin. Along the way Ben and Anna alternately spar with confide in and make calf eyes at each other. Of course by the end of the road they are passionately in love. Although Chasing Liberty is at heart a romance its also a road movie which is its least endearing characteristic. The exotic locales inject a little interest but this is essentially two characters traveling from point A to point B. Theres little freshness or originality in the ""colorful"" individuals they meet on their journey. These include a sticky-fingered hippie named McGruff (Martin Hancock) a friendly gondolier (Joseph Long) and his good-hearted mother (Miriam Margolyes). Weve encountered these people or at least those who are similar in countless other road movies. Its hard to fault Chasing Liberty for following the formula since thats its goal from the beginning. Its looking to please a certain audience and going too far afield might miss the target. The accessory romance between Weiss and Morales could have been excised since neither character is developed enough for it to matter. Their interaction has the rhythm and screen time of something deleted from Love Actually. But aside from padding the running length by about 10 minutes its not a serious fault. The film avoids the painful pitfall of putting Annas life in danger. Moore and Goode generate just enough heat and the requisite number of sparks. The sex scenes are suitably tame and the only nudity is of Anna skinnydipping from behind and in the dark (and not Moore at all - clearly a body-double). The script is laced with innuendo but nothing is raunchy and theres almost no profanity making this friendly to younger teens. Chasing Liberty is not daring or adventurous but considering its release date (early January) its more palatable than one might anticipate.
