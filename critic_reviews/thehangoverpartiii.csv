Credit Melinda Sue Gordon In Theaters Now Rating /4 Maybe the Wolfpack should have disbanded after they got home from Las Vegas. Since then their adventures have grown tired and uninspired and this time out is no exception. PHOTOS Summer movie guide At least audiences get a fresh premise Phil (Bradley Cooper) Stu (Ed Helms) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) must track down crackpot on-the-lam thief Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) and deliver him to John Goodmans drug goon. (Or as Chow refers to him twice ""a fat f--k."") PHOTOS Best and worst movie remakes The dudes trek from Tijuana Mexico to Las Vegas to carry just a few jokes in their baggage. The bulk of them belong to the surreally odd Galifianakis who even milks hilarity out of licking a lollipop. Cooper and Helms meanwhile are underutilized as exasperated straight men. Somewhere between Phil shimmying down the front of Caesars Palace and Mr. Chow on all fours eating dog food it becomes clear how far the franchise has fallen. PHOTOS Celebrity bromances A sad reminder of the originals spark the flimsy scene in which Alan talks to the tot he memorably bonded with in the first movie. Wheres Mike Tyson when you need him?

Occasionally you find a good one but more often the second or third installment dissipates all the fun and sense of discovery that made the original a hit in the first place. The Hangover is one of the funniest movies in recent memory. I tried to remind myself of that as I watched The Hangover Part III a pointless and mostly unfunny film that can only be seen in a positive light because its infinitesimally better than The Hangover Part II. I wont waste much time describing the storyline. Suffice it to say that Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms get in trouble again because of their dimwitted friend Zach Galifianakis whom they try to deliver to a rehabilitation facility in Arizona. Instead theyre waylaid by bad guy John Goodman who holds their friend Justin Bartha for ransom until they can produce the slippery bad guy known as Chow (Ken Jeong). Among the movies built-in problems are the fact that Galifianakis character is more pathetic than amusing and Jeong has far too much screen time for a character who is only funny in tiny spurts. This dreary lamebrain comedy takes everything that was fresh and original in 2009 and beats it into the ground. Director Todd Phillips and his co-writer Craig Mazin are probably laughing all the way to the bank but I had little reason to laugh as I suffered through this time-waster. Lets hope they mean it when they say this is the final film featuring these characters.

Comments click to enlarge The Hangover Part III Video Rated R  100 minutes  2013 Zach Galifianakis takes center stage for this final installment in the party-boy franchise which wisely drops the narrative gimmick of alcohol-induced amnesia that made the first movie so unusual and the second its pallid copy. This time the demented Alan (Galifianakis) grieved by the death of his father is being transported to rehab by his three pals (Bradley Cooper Ed Helms Justin Bartha) when theyre sidetracked by a fearsome goon (John Goodman) who wants them to locate their disreputable pal Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong). The series has always turned on the power of money to buy pleasure (especially in the Third World) yet the single funniest scene here involves Alans doe-eyed flirting with a coarse pawn shop owner (Melissa McCarthy) their love sealed by a shared sucker.

Whats The Worst Thats Happened? Credit Warner Bros. Pictures From The Hangover Part III - Chow Is A Cancer Chow Is A Cancer Credit Warner Bros. Pictures Well they did say this one was going to be different. After The Hangover II essentially duplicated the structure of the first movie --three guys piecing together a night of debauchery and mayhem none of them can entirely remember -- director Todd Phillips promised that the third would go in a new direction. And in a bold if unbelievable move in the era of never-ending sequels he pledged that this Hangover would be the last. A kind of encouraging predictive logic indicated that a third movie might embrace the franchises better instincts While its predecessors suffered from a sensibility mired in casual sexism and homophobia the first also had an inventive conceit a handful of talented comedians in memorable supporting roles and a Zach Galifianakis performance bubbling with unpredictable weirdness. With Phillips given the freedom to conclude this story of debauchery and blackouts on his own terms you might hope for a mixed bag swinging toward decency. Instead theres Hangover III an excessively violent action comedy that handily manages the tough task of feeling at once tired and aggressively heartless. You can almost see its underdeveloped soul shriveling away as the movie kills off any sense of fun the franchise used to have Where The Hangover found its representative image in Galifianakis and that misplaced baby decked out in matching sunglasses this movie offers ... a decapitated giraffe head. Out is the formula with no hangover and few comedic set pieces; in is much more nonsense involving Wolfpack nemesis Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong) a surprisingly high body count thats mostly mammalian and a dark tonal shift that begins when the movie turns on the mostly benign oddball Alan (Galifianakis). Alans antics have occasionally walked the line between harmlessly mad-hatter and unintentionally destructive -- his earnest desire that the guys have a good time together is what got them dosed with roofies in one movie and a muscle relaxants/ADHD meds cocktail in the other. But now his actions have consequences and what The Hangover once asked its audience to read as eccentricity is now viewed as signs of a serious mental problem. Stu (Ed Helms) Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Doug (Justin Bartha) stage an intervention in a scene that both tries to sell Alans behavior as clinically unstable and still trading on it for jokes; its a mixed-message perspective thats all the cheaper because up till now the characters behavior has played a lot more like a loose mix of written and ad-libbed quirks carried by Galifianakis talent than like any diagnosable disorder. Aaaaaanyway On their way to a treatment center the guys are run off the road and held at gunpoint by a group of thugs. An overdose of exposition reveals a menacing John Goodman as Marshall a mobster connected to a minor event in the first movie and now out for revenge on Chow whos recently escaped from a Thai prison. Marshall takes Doug hostage making him the MacGuffin once again -- something the movie refuses to wink at. Only instead of being merely missing hell be dead in a few days unless the others find and deliver Chow. This threat of violence sets up the movies sensibility fueled mostly by funny one-liners from Galifianakis tempered by the straight-up murders of chickens dogs and even people. A franchise that began with successful gags involving guys getting tazed or punched in the face by Mike Tyson now offers up various unstylized unfunny and objectively horrible things as the Wolfpacks remnants track Chow to Tijuana and thence to Vegas. Stu and Phil -- blandly written wastes of Helms and Coopers talents whove never had much to do -- are further reduced to reacting naturalistically to the grim things happening around them. Theyre just a couple of guys having a really bad couple of days. Its the malevolent Chow of Hangover II whose presence and worldview dominate this movie; hes identified as a cancer more than once but his particular brand of evil is unspecific. Hes a broad caricature even less defined than Alan psychopathic sex-obsessed drug-obsessed death-obsessed colorblind dyslexic and fond of karaoke -- hes whatever the plot needs him to be really and whatever kind of insane Ken Jeongs mad-libs make him. The lack of a true characterization wasnt a problem when he occupied a minor spot in the first film but elevated to driving story force he becomes an unmotivated creator of chaos and one too exposed for much of his nonsense to be funny. Theres something or other at the end about Alans eventual growing up a process helped along by his meeting a foil in a pawn-shop owner played by Melissa McCarthy. But the winning moments between them are too few and in the end theres little joy to be gained from any of what happens in this third dull ache of a Hangover; in dumping his formula Phillips throws out just about everything else that made the first movie even a little likable. Theres even a suggestion here that the groups cycle of lost nights and poor choices will repeat with Chow in their lives forever. If that happens lets hope they dont remember it -- and we dont have to see it.

Find out whats happening in the world as it unfolds.Bradley Cooper Zach Galifianakis and Ed Helms star in ""The Hangover Part III.""Story highlightsThe gang is all back for this ""Hangover"" sequelThis time the action takes them to MexicoCritic calls it ""a comedy for sociopaths""If only what happened in Vegas had stayed in Vegas.Everything that made ""The Hangover"" such an unexpected hit -- its bold brilliant pick-up-the-pieces story structure; the way it reveled in exposing the wild side of its outwardly conventional (if mismatched) buddies; and the big dose of strange that was Zack Galifianakis in his breakthrough movie role -- has been squandered and cheapened in two uninspired largely mirthless and meretricious sequels. So much for hair of the dog. At least this time Todd Phillips and co-writer Craig Mazin have come up with some new beats in ""The Hangover Part III"" instead of presenting a carbon copy of the first film. (Original writers Jon Lucas and Scott Moore are long gone of course.) If youre looking for plot theyve got one. Its lazy but at least its straightforward. Phil Stu and Doug (Bradley Cooper Ed Helms and Justin Bartha) are escorting their emotionally volatile buddy Alan (Zack Galifianakis) to a rehab clinic when theyre forced off the road. Crime boss Marshall (John Goodman) explains -- at length -- how their old sparring partner Chow (Ken Jeong) has escaped from a Bangkok prison. Marshall means to hold Doug captive until the Wolfpack produces Chow and the gold bullion he stole. The hunt for Chow takes them to Mexico for no very good reason then back to Nevada for closure (we hope).

His seething hatred for man and beast (""Make sure you kill the guard dogs"" he insists at one point) is so venomous it smacks of some kind of warped integrity. Not that Phillips and company are aiming for warm and fuzzy here. The movie begins (you probably saw a PG version in the trailer) with a giraffe coming to a sticky end on a highway overpass. After buttering us up with this grotesque roadkill the writers follow through with a scene of Alan blithely badgering his father into a fatal heart attack. Its daring I suppose almost a form of anti-comedy. Its so divorced from anything you would want to laugh at. Except that almost none of the audience I saw it with was laughing. Too often in ""Hangover III"" profanity passes for wit and bad taste is equated with taboo-busting. If there is something subversive about Alans man-love for Phil -- and Galifianakis presexual overgrown adolescent remains the movies closeted comedic focal point -- its all bound up in an ugly tangle of homophobic taunts male bonding cliches and the virtual exclusion of the opposite sex (Heather Grahams solitary scene very much included). For a series built on friendship this is one cold and alienating movie a comedy for sociopaths. The longer we hang out with these guys the less fun they are to be with. And judging by the way he seems to be edging out of the frame all the time Im guessing Bradley Cooper feels the same way. It may represent a marginal improvement on the disastrous second film but there must be a hole in the desert somewhere big enough to bury this sorry sordid franchise once and for all.

The Hangover Part III (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Hangover Part III (R) A crass and grating cash-grab by bored-looking actors in search of a script. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com5/23/2013 Editor rating 1 Theres exactly one good scene in all of The Hangover Part III  a hilarious bit of business halfway during the end credits that reminds you what made the original film so good. The rest of this odious mean-spirited movie -- the crassest cash-grab to come out of a Hollywood studio in recent memory -- appropriates the title and the characters from the previous pictures and sends them on a would-be adventure involving gangsters gold bars and that pinnacle of hilarity  decapitated giraffes. Although The Hangover Part II grossed 586 million worldwide audiences complained it was mostly an uninspired remake of the first movie. Intent on giving viewers something different director and co-writer Todd Phillips set out on an new yet hackneyed direction. No more wild bachelor parties or bouts of amnesia or inspired bits of absurdist humor. Instead the four pals known as The Wolfpack (Bradley Cooper Ed Helms Zach Galifianakis and Justin Bartha) are threatened by a mobster (John Goodman) to find the elusive Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) and bring back the loot he stole -- or else. What ensues is a series of chases through Mexico and eventually Las Vegas with the actors trying hard not to look bored and failing. Galifianakis who is usually reliable for off-the-wall improvised riffs seems to have stuck to the lame script this time. Cooper and Helms go through the paces but its clear they are here only for their paychecks. Bartha as usual for the series is MIA for most of the picture stuck with one of the most thankless roles in cinematic history. The movies main focus is actually Jeong (TVs Community) who can be hilarious in small doses but gets way too much screen time to do his grating homophobic racist schtick. The Hangover Part III like the rest of the films Phillips has directed looks fantastic and contains some elaborate setpieces that make you wonder how the filmmaker would fare with a straightforward action picture. But the story is moribund the energy low and the movie is so wan that even a cameo by Melissa McCarthy falls flat proving for the first time that the terrific actress isnt capable of enlivening any comedy shes in. The Hangover Part IIIs biggest sin is that there are hardly any actual jokes or sight gags in it (Galifianakis asking Cooper where he bought his shirt is not a joke). This is a smug witless picture that makes you feel like youve been had -- at least until that great bit over the end credits shows up and you go home wondering how that movie might have turned out.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday May 24 2013 1201AM EDT Last updated Friday May 24 2013 1201AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Todd Phillips Written by Todd Phillips Craig Mazin Starring Zach Galifianakis Bradley Cooper Ed Helms Classification 14A Genre comedy Year 2013 Country USA Language English ""I told myself I would never go back.""Guys go out on the town get roaring drunk wake up with a hangover cant remember what they did. If that doesnt sound like a billion-dollar global franchise to you check the receipts - even Hollywood accountants cant fiddle those sorts of grosses. Of course the first Hangover established the brand earning big bucks because it had a clever reverse narrative and was actually pretty damn funny. So the second didnt have to be funny and wasnt but at least existed somewhere in the general vicinity of that borderless country known as Comedy. Part III doesnt not even remotely which makes it not just bad but weirdly fascinatingly bad. What exactly is this? Certainly a cash cow definitely an exercise in cynicism maybe even a cri de coeur from the self-hating principals. Whatever a comedy it aint. Multimedia The Hangover Part III The official trailer video Video Ferrell Galifianaki campaign for laughs ""Do you even know whats going on?""Consider if you dare the plot. Sorry to be the deliverer of sad news but the hangover is entirely missing from Hangover III. Theres no booze. Instead in a yarn that appears to be swiped from a moribund heist flick there is bullion a whole lot of ill-gotten gold that our four returning dudes - Bradley Cooper Zach Galifianakis Ed Helms Justin Bartha - are obliged to track down and give back to its villainous owner without as I mentioned the aid of any alcoholic stimulants. Thats one way of looking at the so-called plot. Another might be this Four actors who got rich playing drunk are now chasing after more money sober. My advice is to forget the nonsensical text and focus on the more interesting subtext which isnt funny either but does raise an intriguing question. Watch the faces of our fab four especially Coopers and youll see that question writ large ""Can I totally phone in a performance and still collect my bullion?""""I got a plan but youre not gonna like it.""The fascinatingly bad continues. Death abounds in this non-comedy. Many things die. Animals get killed; people get killed; needless to say our patience gets thoroughly slaughtered. We arrive at the killing field early when Galifianakis whose man-child dominates the outing is driving on the freeway. Hes in a convertible thats pulling an open trailer on which stands an elegant giraffe. Car driver trailer beautiful tall creature speed toward a low overpass when splat beauty is decapitated. The head literally rolls whereupon this being a foul-mouthed non-comedy someone is made (more or less) to say ""He killed a giraffe. Who gives a damn?""""Youre not good for me.""A bunch of dead chickens a dead daddy a matched set of dead guard dogs and a couple of dead gangsters later what seemed like a mere exercise in cynicism has morphed into a full-fledged marathon all run under the fluttering banner of ""Who gives a damn?""As long as that other animal the sacred cash cow is alive and healthy nothing else matters. And at this billion-dollar juncture in the franchise everyone involved here - director writers cast - knows that the cash cow doesnt require much in the way of maintenance. They dont need to be good they dont need to be funny they just need to be there.""You just dont get it do you?""You may have noticed the italicized quotations scattered above. All are taken directly from the movie admittedly lifted out of context. Yet these quotes and others much like them recur so often that it cant be coincidence and so they seem to establish their own context seem to be a kind of subliminal movie within the movie. Thats when the self-hating cri de coeur is heard. I told myself I would never go back. Youre not good for me. We sure arent laughing but you might have thought the principals were at least on their way to the bank. But no. Amid all the slaughter here - that giraffe our patience the good name of entertainment - even the slaughterers sound worried about the blood on their hands. Culturally speaking its enough to drive you to drink and hang the hangover.

Watch a clip from the film ""We Steal Secrets The Story of WikiLeaks"" a documentary that details the creation of Julian Assanges controversial website which facilitated the largest security breach in U.S. history. (Photo/Video Focus World) By John Anderson May 23 2013 637 p.m. ET Director Alex Gibney has a gift for transforming the impenetrable into the palatable if not frogs into princes Jack Abramoff Eliot Spitzer Henry Kissinger and the Enron culprits have all been given the Gibney treatment and emerged bruised if not bowed. So its unfortunate as well as ironic that Mr. Gibneys latest documentary ""We Steal Secrets The Story of WikiLeaks"" contains not a single first-hand interview with Julian Assange engineer of the biggest security breach in U.S. intelligence history the ""crazy white-haired Aussie"" as described by the U.S. Armys very incarcerated Pfc. Bradley Manning. As Mr. Gibney relates in voiceover Mr. Assange the ""transparency radical"" engaged the filmmaker in six hours of negotiations for an interview whose ""market rate"" was 1 million. There was some wriggle room Mr. Assange would consider meeting Mr. Gibneys price--free--if Mr. Gibney would spy for him on others in the film. The offer was declined. ENLARGE Julian Assange left with WikiLeaks staffers Focus World The engine of Mr. Assanges cupidity may well have been his expensive legal problems stemming from sex-abuse charges in Sweden from which he is currently hiding in the Ecuadoran Embassy in London. Regardless a warm affection for the films subject is not a requirement for appreciating the virtues of the film. ""We Steal Secrets"" is a documentary constructed on dualities among them state security vs. the First Amendment. And good vs. evil. Mr. Assanges lack of charisma and his flexible morality are key to making Mr. Gibneys unspoken point that the only thing close to a hero in this story is a short angry sexually confused Army private first class named Manning. It was Mr. Manning currently residing in Ft. Leavenworth Kan. who in 2010 leaked the video of a 2007 airstrike in Baghdad that killed two children two Reuters reporters and eight other people who happened to be on the street. Mr. Gibney includes the footage. Not surprisingly the image surpasses words. But what WikiLeaks released in 2010 were in fact words--250000-plus U.S. documents most of which have ultimately been more embarrassing than damaging save for regimes brought down during the Arab Spring which the WikiLeaks event was credited with helping to incite. Much of the story is also about email. So how do you make this a motion picture? Some might call it sleight-of-hand but its something Mr. Gibney has proved himself adept at time and time again--that is the massaging of raw information and talking heads into cinema through the use of stylistic flourishes a keen ear for music and a buoyant rhythm that carries the viewer along. The portrait of Mr. Assange is constructed through second-hand interviews and archival footage of his appearances in say Iceland where an early WikiLeaks offensive blew the lid off that countrys banking scandal. The portrait of Mr. Manning meanwhile is created via still photographs a snatch of video footage and his emails which become a surprisingly effective device Displayed in lowercase typed out against a vast monochromatic backdrop they mirror a lonely troubled personality wracked with doubt but committed to doing what he feels is right. The messages become doubly plaintive for having been exchanged with Adrian Lamo a hacker and ""security consultant"" who turned Mr. Manning in after having become his confidant. Mr. Lamos several appearances are rather pathetic his speech slurred his tears apparently encouraged by a considerable amount of medication. Mr. Gibney may not have had access to Messrs. Manning or Assange but he has lots of other people with lots to say. The effervescent Gen. Michael Hayden a former head of both the CIA and the NSA is certainly forthcoming and glib He says he agrees with Mr. Assange that Americans should know what their government is doing; he just hasnt figured out a way to keep the same information from our enemies. Nick Davies a reporter for the Guardian of London who worked closely with Mr. Assange portrays the WikiLeaks chief as an information absolutist who didnt care what sensitive names might be in the leaked documents especially if those people had ""collaborated"" with coalition forces in Afghanistan. Asked how WikiLeaks compared with say Apple Gavin MacFadyen the director of the Center for Investigative Journalism roars with laughter It was ""more like a corner gas station with a couple of very bright attendants."" Such Assange intimates as James Ball who assumed the leadership of WikiLeaks after Mr. Assange was accused of rape by two Swedish women (one of whom is interviewed and makes a very convincing witness for herself) have clearly lost their faith. WikiLeaks assumes the past tense in ""We Steal Secrets"" although the story is not quite over at least for Pfc. Manning. --Mr. Anderson is a critic in New York. Joe Morgenstern is on vacation. The Hangover Part III Its no wonder these guys seem exhausted. When the first ""Hangover"" arrived in 2009 it seemed to come out of nowhere a tale of the Las Vegas bachelor party that wouldnt end (little did we know) and starring up-and-comers Bradley Cooper Zach Galifianakis Ed Helms and madman Ken Jeong. That it earned about eight times its budget necessitated a sequel set largely in Bangkok and now we have Part III the alleged finale which involves trips to Tijuana and again Las Vegas. The geographic circularity is reassuring although no one has actually ruled out ""Hangover on Ice."" ENLARGE Ed Helms Bradley Cooper and Zach Galifianakis Warner Bros. Pictures Watch a clip from the film ""The Hangover Part III."" This time theres no wedding. No bachelor party. What could go wrong right? But when the Wolfpack hits the road all bets are off. (Photo/Video Warner Bros) Still ""Hangover III"" is likable enough even as it collapses in a heap. Alan the oh-so-annoying boy-man played with a demented brilliance by Mr. Galifianakis has driven his father ( Jeffrey Tambor) to his grave. Which leads the rest of the so-called Wolf Pack to stage an intervention so Alan will get the psychological help he needs if not the swift kick in the pants. En route to the facility the boys are intercepted by crime boss Marshall ( John Goodman) who launches into a 10-minute explanation of whats happened in the previous episodes whats happening now why he desperately wants to get his hands around the throat of the nefarious fugitive gay gangster Mr. Chow (Mr. Jeong) and why hes taking their pal Doug ( Justin Bartha) hostage until they deliver Chow. Mr. Bartha who has been escorted off the storyline in every other ""Hangover"" seems resigned to his fate. Theres so much exposition its almost a self-reflective joke This is how you write screenplays writer-director Todd Phillips seems to be saying when youre looking for an escape hatch. The only thing that breathes life into the movie is Mr. Jeong who is outrageous politically incorrect and therefore incredibly tastelessly funny. The lasting image from ""Hangover III"" will be Mr. Jeong paragliding through the Vegas night bellowing ""I love cocaine"" It may not be much. But at least its over. --J.A. The English Teacher A screwball comedy that could have been screwier ""The English Teacher"" is as interesting for its cast as its content. Julianne Moore plays Linda Sinclair the repressed lit-loving spinster of the title; Michael Angarano is Jason Sherwood a returning high-school alumnus and frustrated playwright whose dark drama Linda decides the school should stage. Greg Kinnear is Dr. Tom Sherwood Jasons father whom Linda recklessly accuses of suffocating his son--a lad who is everyone comes to agree something of a knucklehead. Dads not quite sure about Ms. Sinclair either. ENLARGE Julianne Moore Everett Collection Watch a clip from the film ""The English Teacher."" An English teachers (Julianne Moore) life is disrupted when a former student returns to her small town after failing as a playwright in New York. (Photo/Video Cinedigm Entertainment Group) Very much to his credit ubiquitous television director Craig Zisk has cast his comedy with three consistently outstanding performers who always seem like round pegs negotiating square holes. With the glorious exception of Todd Hayness ""Far From Heaven"" Ms. Moores far-too-few movies have made full use of her combination of beauty and depth. Mr. Angarano is a convincing reflexively funny actor of whom one never sees enough. Mr. Kinnear simply exudes too much native intelligence to be plausible in most leading man roles so he plays writers in crisis thwarted inventors frazzled fathers or something else off center. He does it again here true but in this film he doesnt have to hide being smart. The flashes of discordant tonalities in ""The English Teacher"" suggest that the script by Dan and Stacy Chariton was tempered in the translation from English to ""English Teacher"" but its a very likable comedy enhanced by a couple of Broadway regulars ( Norbert Leo Butz and Jessica Hecht as clueless school administrators) Nathan Lane as the schools feckless drama teacher and the three principal actors who seldom let you down if theyre aboard a vehicle in tune with their talents. The vinegary narration by Fiona Shaw adds to an appetizing mix. --J.A. Before Midnight Something close to rapture will greet this sequel to Richard Linklaters two previous ""Before"" movies--""Before Sunrise"" (1995) and ""Before Sunset"" (2004)--idiosyncratic romantic adventures that give new meaning to the term ""talkie."" Back in 1995 Jesse ( Ethan Hawke) and Celine ( Julie Delpy) met on a train got off in Vienna spent the night in deep conversation and promised to meet in six months. Nine years later (""Before Sunset"") Jesse is unhappily married with a son he and Celine reconnect and by the time the sun actually sets the machinery of their happiness has been set in motion. ENLARGE Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke Sony Pictures Classics Watch a clip from the film ""Before Midnight"" the sequel to ""Before Sunrise"" and ""Before Sunset."" Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) are now a couple living in Paris and parents to twin girls. (Photo/Video Sony) So what happened? Time. Everything about Mr. Linklaters fluidly photographed poetic picture is about time beginning with the fact that the characters are on vacation on a Greek seacoast the kind of place where time would seem to both stop and move too fast. The languorous multigenerational dinner that opens up the film is an affront to studio-style hyperactivity. The conversations between Celine and Jesse are prolonged occasionally to the point of pain. What they talk about--their children their regrets their resentments--are all about how theyve used or abused what are beginning to look like vanishing years. The final protracted argument between the principals consumes the last 30 minutes of the film. Its a wildly uneven enterprise overall. The early sequences work wonderfully but when Mr. Hawke and Ms. Delpy start delving into the dysfunctional heart of their relationship Celine grows shrill Jesse more tiresomely tolerant. For all the marvelous filmmaking in ""Before Midnight"" its embrace of a free-form visual style and a script that aspires to feel improvisational conflicts with an often stilted delivery by the actors These are not people who have spent the last nine years together. Theyre people catching up after nine years. No couple with twin girls and a custody issue would have to tell each other so much. They wouldnt have to tell each other anything. In fact if they harbored as much resentment as Celine and Jesse they might not talk at all. --J.A. DVD Focus ENLARGE Far From Heaven (2002) Director Todd Haynes honors and explodes the very consciously constructed social mirage erected by 1950s director Douglas Sirk (""Magnificent Obsession"" ""Imitation of Life"") in this postmodern soap about artifice and longing. Cathy Whitaker (a transcendent Julianne Moore) is a Connecticut housewife living a June Cleaver existence in a postcard world whose husband ( Dennis Quaid) is gay and whose instinctive liberalism clashes with the stuffily staid world around her. Shes confused poor thing and her response to the tumult--an almost-romance with the black gardener Raymond Deagan ( Dennis Haysbert)--takes matters where Mr. Sirk never quite could. ENLARGE The Man in the Chair (2007) Christopher Plummer would not win his elusive Best Actor Oscar for this 2007 film by director Michael Schroeder but he might have As Flash Madden curmudgeon retired gaffer and nostalgic veteran of a bygone Hollywood the actor pulls out all the stops bouncing deftly off two fine co-stars. The esteemed M. Emmet Walsh is even crankier than Mr. Plummer; together they nurture then-newcomer Michael Angaranos semidelinquent would-be director who discovers that Flash is the last surviving crew member from ""Citizen Kane"" and enlists him in making a movie. Its a mentors tale and a showcase for solid unrestrained acting. ENLARGE Taxi to the Dark Side (2007) An Oscar winner for Best Documentary Alex Gibneys examination of torture murder and institutionalized brutality at the U.S. detention facility in Bagram Afghanistan is a model of angry/objective reportage and an example of aesthetics in service to journalism. The narration music graphics and the precisely composed images of cinematographers Maryse Alberti and Greg Andracke temper the despair at the heart of a film that pulls no punches Coming on the heels of Mr. Gibneys Oscar-nominated ""Enron The Smartest Guys in the Room"" ""Taxi"" does for command responsibility what ""Enron"" did for corporate hubris.

"Hangover Part III The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; hangover-part-iii-the ) Hangover Part III The (United States 2013) May 23 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli The Hangover Part III is an obvious example of how wrong things can go when the almighty dollar is allowed to rule what comes out of Hollywood. When the first Hangover stunned analysts by becoming not just successful but a massive hit director Todd Phillips was immediately approached about a sequel. He did what most people in his position would do he took the money and churned out an inferior product that was nearly a carbon copy of the original. Although not as inventive or energetic it was still funny and thats the most important quality that can be attributed to a comedy. The Hangover Part II was therefore also a box office giant. Therein were planted the seeds that germinated into the giant weed of The Hangover Part III. Phillips once again lured back by an oversized paycheck elected to ""go in a different direction"" this time. Apparently ""a different direction"" means eliminating most of the humor in favor of B-grade caper/thriller elements relegating Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Stu (Ed Helms) to supporting roles in the Alan (Zach Galifianakis) and Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) Show and including action scenes that seem like Mission Impossible outtakes. The Hangover was high octane fun. The Hangover Part II despite its repetitive nature was enjoyable. The Hangover Part III is some kind of hideous experiment in mass consumer torture. This time no ones going to a bachelor party. No one wakes up in a strange hotel room surrounded by evidence of a nights debauchery. Instead the event that brings Phil Stu and Alan back together is an intervention being held by Alans brother-in-law Doug (Justin Bartha) for the hairy man-child after he decapitates a giraffe and presides over his fathers funeral. The four guys hop in a car for a road trip but before they can reach Arizona theyre kidnapped by Marshall (John Goodman) a gangster-type who wants to use their ""friendship"" with Mr. Chow to locate the crazy Chinese psycho. Apparently Chow has stolen millions of dollars in gold from Marshall and he wants it back. He holds Doug hostage with the promise to kill him if Phil Stu and Alan cant deliver. All this is played with a dour seriousness that encourages us to forget that this is supposed to be a comedy. In small roles in The Hangover and The Hangover Part II Ken Jeong was a blast. With his part expanded in The Hangover Part III he quickly overstays his welcome. This time around hes not an adjunct to the main storyline; he is the main storyline. The majority of The Hangover Part III involves The Wolfpack chasing him and when they catch him joining up with him for one reason or another. Jeong pitches his performance at the level most likely to grate on a viewers nerves although he has plenty of competition from Galifianakis whose socially inept Alan not necessarily the most likeable guy in the other installments is nails-on-the-blackboard irritating here. It doesnt take long for us to wish that the giraffe has survived and Alan had lost his head. For about 100 minutes The Hangover Part III stumbles and bumbles along caring less about generating laughs than advancing the lame quasi-thriller subplot that might have been amusing if the tone wasnt so grim. Along the way a few old friends make appearances (Heather Graham and Mike Epps) but those cameos only stir a deep sense of nostalgia and remind us how much better the first Hangover was. Like Mike Tyson the elements that made the first two movies ""destination comedies"" is completely M.I.A. The Hangover Part III finally hits its stride during the end credits - and thats not intended as a snarky comment. Theres a 90-second inter-credit scene thats funnier than anything in the main feature. It can either be seen as a stand-alone gag or if theres a fourth Hangover as a teaser for the next movie. After more than an hour and a half of dreary halfhearted material that short segment offers a burst of comedic adrenaline although far too little far too late. The audience loved it which is more than can be said about everything that precedes it. Its sad to watch a series that began with so much promise devolve into something so tedious and irrelevant. Movies like this may make money but they devalue their franchises. Look no further than The Matrix for an example. All three chapters were profitable but the existence of the final two regarded in hindsight as bloated excesses have hurt the reputation of the first. The Hangover Part III is a testament to why some movies should never get made and when they are what the result can end up being.

Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide The first ""Hangover"" movie was a monster hit that I found mildly amusing. The sequel was a scummy unfunny mess. Now we have ""The Hangover Part III"" which is being billed as the last in the series. Lets hope so.The wolf pack is on the prowl again ending up in Vegas where it all began sort of. Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms are essentially straight men to Zach Galifianakiss Alan and Ken Jeongs Mr. Chow both of whom take turns trying to gross everybody out. But gross-outs devoid of laughs?The tonal problem of the second installment which often resembled a drug-infested pulp thriller instead of a comedy is also problematic here.

Area theaters. If every generation gets the comedy team they deserve heres good news for all of us The guys from the ""Hangover"" films have hilariously crazily evolved. Not that Phil (Bradley Cooper) Alan (Zach Galifianakis) and Stu (Ed Helms) are thinking deep thoughts. But the pleasant surprise of ""The Hangover Part III"" is a belated bout of adulthood has only made the extended-adolescent characters funnier. The result is a more traditional but more hysterical crowd-pleaser. Alan in fact is acting like a troubled teen when Phil and Stu catch up to him. The 42-year-old just buried his dad (Jeffrey Tambor) beheaded a giraffe (dont ask) and is acting lost (when not acting out). So Alans family intervenes and books him at a Southwestern mental health facility with Phil Stu and Alans brother-in-law Doug (Justin Bartha) driving him there. But theres a hitch. Barely out of L.A. the guys are shanghaied by a mob boss (John Goodman) owed 21 million in gold by Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong) the nutsy albatross around the guys necks. The mobster takes Doug hostage until the gold is retrieved. Heather Graham co-stars as Jade in The Hangover Part III. Turns out the gold is hidden in Vegas a place the still-shellshocked Stu vowed never to return to after the lost bachelor party of four years ago. But for Alan its a step forward especially after a brief encounter with a tattooed antique store owner (Melissa McCarthy). Abandoning the ""What happened last night?"" structure -- which marred the second entry -- frees ""Part III"" to relax into its own goofy groove. Director Todd Phillips wild ride through the mind of the American guy (strippers monkeys road trips troublemaking) now lopes easily from epic set-pieces to male rite-of-passage shenanigans. Even Jeong is palatable as Chow the films irrepressible id. On the lam from a Bangkok prison the out-there oddball is less punch line and more endearing. ""The Hangover Part III"" focuses on the character of Alan played by Zach Galifianakis. (Melinda Sue Gordon/AP) Yet its the connection between the main trio thats most winning mainly because the actors avoid cartoonishness. Coopers droll way with throwaway lines (well deployed in his Oscar-nominated turn in ""Silver Linings Playbook"") has only improved. The wry Helms dials down the hysteria as Stu approaches his own self-revelation. Galifianakis though is the key here. Able to smash a scene to smithereens with the simplest of lines the hirsute comic is as unpredictable as ever yet takes director Todd Phillips bait to up the stakes. Its a treat to see the loony man-child Alan blooming in love friendship and even faux-fatherhood after a reunion with baby Carlos from the first film. Alan happily will be okay. Just keep him away from the giraffes. Tags positive review Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Didnt the letdown of The Hangover Part II - basically Part I set in Thailand but minus the laughs - teach you anything? Guess not. I left Part III thinking that everyone involved went dutifully through the motions. Nothing more. The first movie left you with an exhilarating rush. All that Part III leaves is well a hangover. More News 26 Movies Not to Miss This Summer Zach Galifianakis Reluctant Superstar All Stories >> There are a few smiles. First its nice to see the Wolfpack back. Bradley Cooper as teacher Phil Ed Helms as dentist Stu Justin Bartha as Doug (the lost groom from the first movie) and Zach Galifianakis as Alan the misfit whos lost in almost every situation. My second smile happened after the boys have a near-lethal run-in with a gangster (Hangover newbie John Goodman) and found themselves back in Vegas where The Hangover earned its place in history as the most successful R-rated comedy in well history. Youd think that Sin City would remind the actors and director Todd Phillips who co-wrote the script with Craig Mazin what made the first Hangover work like gangbusters. But no. Except for the nut-ball presence of Ken Jeong as crazed mobster Mr. Chow the movie just lies there. In one scene Chow parachutes down over the Vegas Strip muttering curses about the ""motherfuckers"" whove ruined his party. Watching the movie strain for laughs makes you feel Chows frustration. For a movie critic screaming ""motherfuckers"" just wont cut it. Theres a responsibility to dig deeper into the reasons the final chapter in the Hangover trilogy goes wrong - beyond indicting the paycheck-driven greed that incites Hollywood to repeat and repeat every movie that mines box-office gold. Or maybe thats reason enough. Motherfuckers. Dont Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox.

The Hangover Part III a sobering conclusion review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Hangover Part III a sobering conclusion reviewThe final chapter in Todd Phillips movie series The Hangover Part III disappoints even if the Wolf Pack does end up in Vegas again.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterMovie WriterThu. May 23 2013 The Hangover Part III 2 stars Starring Bradley Cooper Ed Helms Zach Galifianakis Justin Bartha and Ken Jeong. Directed by Todd Phillips. 100 minutes. Opens Thursday at major theatres. 14A Sobriety is not Todd Phillips s friend. Article Continued Below In The Hangover Part III  the third and final instalment of his gold-plated franchise the director chases the tale of the buddy groomsmen a final time tying up loose ends and filling in plot holes we didnt realize existed in a story of three clear-headed men and a psychotic. This makes for a more interesting movie story-wise than 2011s Hangover II  the lazy unfunny retread of The Hangover spiced up in desperate fashion with a chain-smoking monkey. But dont pop the champagne just yet. Those looking for hilarity and hijinks with episode three will find the party is indeed over. For The Hangover Part III  Phillips and writer Craig Mazin ( Hangover Part II  Identity Thief ) seem less concerned with laughs than they are with penning a freaky desert chase epic. A brave choice but in so doing Phillips has excised the plot points that once drew the biggest yuks theres no clock running out on a wedding no bachelor party and no drunken blackouts. In fact the most amusing part of the movie happens after the end credits start to roll a gift to fans who may have been feeling unsatisfied and perhaps even ripped off by the previous 100 minutes. This time the story focuses on Alan ( Zach Galifianakis ) the creator and curator of the Wolf Pack. The three-bean salad of neurosis and psychotic behaviours is off his meds (exactly how he is different from Alan on his meds is debatable). Hes so out of control he buys a giraffe which he then gleefully drives into a highway bridge and decapitates. (This is hardly a spoiler; its the focal point of the trailer.) His Wolf Pack pals handsome Phil ( Bradley Cooper ) worrywart Stu ( Ed Helms ) and disposable Doug ( Justin Bartha ) stage an intervention to convince Alan he needs to go to rehab. Theyll even drive him to Arizona for treatment. Road trip A carload of masked thugs has other plans forcing them off the road and into the waiting arms of mobster Marshall ( John Goodman  hardly his finest hour) who is convinced Alan is in contact with his old nemesis effeminate wild man gangster Leslie Chow ( Ken Jeong ). Turns out he is. Chow has skipped from a Thai prison and is sending Alan affectionate text messages. Seems theres a large amount of Marshalls gold missing and disposable Doug will do nicely as a hostage until the Wolf Pack tracks down Chow and gets it back. Characters from previous installments return for quick bits that serve as flashbacks and there are glimpses of the originality that made this journey initially worth taking. But its short lived as Phil Stu and Alan (and Chow) end up back in Las Vegas by way of Tijuana where Chow and the lads show just how sad the whole business has become with a remarkably unfunny scene involving fighting cocks and a small room. Alan slips deeper into whatever nasty stuff is stewing in his melon which occasionally leads to surreal moments and even some solid comic bits. His exchange with Bridesmaids  Melissa McCarthy (fast emerging as a comic genius) as a horny Vegas pawnshop owner barred from certain casinos for good reason is sublimely funny. Back in Vegas theres no laughs jackpot even with the aid of a crazed limo chase and some amusing business involving bed sheets and the roof of Caesars Palace. Lines that should be funny dont hit the mark making the events come with a sense of deja vu punctuated with a nagging feeling that something is missing. What could it be? Oh yeah humour. Initially a hilariously funny R-rated buddy flick wrapped around a missing-groom-in-Vegas yarn The Hangover grossed an estimated 467.5 million established the careers of its stars and earning a well-deserved place on my Top 10 movies list for 2009. Although it stumbled badly in the second instalment Part II still earned more than 100 million more than the original. The Hangover Part III will likely set the box office aflame once again but it will be all thanks to the goodwill and good times of the original. The adventures of the Wolf Pack we are told ends here. And it brings to mind words about bangs and whimpers.

Credit Warner Brothers Pictures The Wolfpack rides again. Or rather it limps exhaustedly over the tundra in what is billed as the final edition of the ""Hangover"" trilogy. Defanged with glazed eyes and creaking joints these superannuated party animals try vainly to stir up some enthusiasm during a return visit to Las Vegas the site of the first ""Hangover"" movie. But their heart isnt in it.As the expectant audience at the screening I attended waited for ""The Hangover Part III"" to explode into action with the usual lewd gross-out antics only a few scattered laughs could be heard along with much grumbling after the final credits. For ""The Hangover Part III"" directed by Todd Phillips from a screenplay he wrote with Craig Mazin is a dull lazy walkthrough that along with ""The Big Wedding"" has a claim to be the years worst star-driven movie.In case you need to be reminded or somehow missed the earlier editions the Wolfpack includes Phil (Bradley Cooper) Doug (Justin Bartha) Stu (Ed Helms) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) four of the unlikeliest on-the verge-of-middle-age buddies ever to join forces in search of adventure. Phil is the charmer Doug the straight arrow Stu the square and Alan the infantile id.""The Hangover Part III"" concentrates more on Alan than the earlier movies did and on their troublemaking sometime sidekick and nemesis the whiny-voiced sociopathic Asian gangster Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong). An early scene in which Alan is speeding home in his sports car with a giraffe in an attached trailer promises more comedy than is subsequently delivered. As Alan reaches an underpass his long-necked pet is decapitated and the accident causes a traffic pileup. It is the first of several acts of cruelty to animals. Dogs are shot and a coked-up chicken is smothered. Photo From left Mr. Galifianakis Ken Jeong Mr. Helms and Mr. Cooper. Credit Melinda Sue Gordon/Warner Brothers Pictures After the giraffe mishap the other Wolfpack members stage an intervention to which Alan reluctantly agrees. While taking him to a rehab center they are intercepted by a hulking mobster named Marshall (John Goodman) and his goons wearing pig masks. Marshall blames Chow for stealing millions of dollars of gold bricks and takes Doug as a hostage until Chow is brought to him along with the gold.The story awkwardly zigzags to Mexico and back. When the guys discover that Chow is in Las Vegas holed up in a heavily guarded penthouse suite with drugs and escorts at Caesars Palace they re-enter Sin City -- where all their troubles began -- and try to capture him. These Las Vegas adventures are a sequence of perfunctory stunts entering the penthouse from the roof on tied-together sheets Chows escaping by parachute and the tedious chasing that pads out the movie. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In the most amusing scene set in Las Vegas Alan and Cassie (Melissa McCarthy in a cameo role as a mean-spirited pawnbroker) make goo-goo eyes at each other in a grotesque flirtation that involves the passing of a red lollipop from one mouth into another. The most strained and lifeless moment brings back Heather Grahams character from the first ""Hangover"" simply as a reference.At their best the earlier ""Hangover"" movies were anarchic absurdist farces descended from Abbott and Costello the Three Stooges and the Hope-Crosby road movies but with a libido inflamed by drugs and booze. In the spirit of those forerunners the members of the Wolfpack may age but they never learn from experience. One excuse for their naivete is that most of their mayhem takes place while they are blind drunk. Their hangovers seem to last only a few minutes before theyre up and running.But the toll has been severe on the series if not the characters. Only in a sight gag during the final credits is there a momentary flare-up of the old antic spirit. Otherwise ""The Hangover Part III"" is dead.Goodbye and good riddance.""The Hangover Part III"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for strong language brief nudity and violence.

Print Email Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on May 23 2013 at 642 AM updated May 23 2013 at 1202 PM comments Did you like the original ""The Hangover""? Dont feel guilty. I liked the original ""The Hangover"" -- and so did millions of other people. But apparently no one liked it as much as its director Todd Phillips - because he keeps doing it over and over again. There was the sequel ""The Hangover Part II"" -- which was so similar it might as well have been a remake. And ""Due Date"" which brought back one of the ""Hangover"" stars to trot out even more jokes about road trips from hell and overgrown frat boys (Which would make sense because before ""The Hangover"" Todd Phillips two biggest films were ""Road Trip"" about a road trip and ""Old School"" about overgrown fratboys. He also once shot a documentary called ""Frat House."" Do you see a pattern here? Or at least just a particularly narrow frame of reference?) And now it seems its time for ""The Hangover Part III"" because well who doesnt like money? And in the past Phillips has done a very good job of separating audiences from theirs. The problem? Phillips hasnt had any ideas for jokes since ""The Hangover"" (whose jokes actually came from two other screenwriters). And not having ideas for jokes can be a problem when youre trying to write your own new comedy. His strategy for the first ""The Hangover"" sequel was simply to repeat all the old gags only louder. His novel intention in this one was apparently to try to make a comedy without any gags at all. The story has friends Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms volunteering to drive odd hanger-on Zach Galifianakis to a sanitarium. Sounds like a good idea. But along the way they run into John Goodman playing a murderous gangster who bears them a grudge and now wants them to kidnap the nasty Mr. Chow. This isnt exactly logical -- who would put these three screwups in charge of anything? -- but at least it makes more sense than bringing the villainous Chow back especially as a main character. In the first film Ken Jeongs mad foul-mouthed little villain was a joke in and of himself; he came on screen got his laughs and left. But making him an even larger figure than he was in ""II"" not only cuts down on the interaction between the other actors -- half the fun of the original -- but quickly wears out his welcome. Five minutes of Chow might be funny; 100 minutes of his put-on pidgin-English screeching is numbing. Galifianakis gets some laughs solely from his own hard work. He has a wonderfully weird flirty scene with Melissa McCarthy (another comedy MVP). And the deadpan way he delivers a line almost tricks you into thinking youve just heard a joke. But outside of a wild purposefully tasteless gag with a giraffe early on (dont ask) the movie just limps along occasionally dragging in a previous guest star in vain hopes youll somehow find it all nostalgic. Hey remember when this was funny? But by the time the whole cast is back in Vegas -- again -- you can smell the desperation like flopsweat. The first ""Hangover"" was good dirty fun; the second was dirtier and less fun. But the third? Its just a chore -- and no hair of the dog is going to make it any easier to bear. Youre better off staying on the wagon. And wed all be better off if Phillips swore off this stuff for a long long while. Ratings note The film contains strong language drug and alcohol abuse full-frontal nudity sexual situations and violence. The Hangover Part III (R) Warner Bros (100 min.) Directed by Todd Phillips.

"Review Hangover Part III is just one long headache - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Hangover Part III is just one long headache Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Who let the dogs out?In 2009 the Baha Mens lyrics felt caustic clever comical and slightly subversive perfect for the debauched Las Vegas bachelor party that was about to unfold. Phil Stu and Alan -- a.k.a. the Wolfpack played by Bradley Cooper Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis -- were about to begin their politically incorrect impossibly irreverent and consistently perverse struggle to reconstruct the night and figure out where they lost the groom. Side-splittingly hilarious it used a heady blend of Mike Tyson a Bengal tiger a hooker a baby a chicken and a crazed screaming and sometimes naked Mr. Chow to incredible comic effect. The movie came out of the blue. It was blue -- its hard-R edge took the summer by surprise.And then it took the summer. PHOTOS Scenes from ""The Hangover Part 3""Ah those were the days historic even when ""The Hangover"" stood for something. For better or worse a cultural threshold had been crossed the raunch rules rewritten.And now? Im not sure who let the dogs out this time but they should be made to pay.Or forced to suffer the fate of the giraffe in the ubiquitous trailers -- the one whose long lovely neck wont clear the low clearance bridge. The giraffe is only a portent of bad things to come. The audacious jokiness of a chicken picking through the morning-after wreckage in the first film has devolved into fighting cocks being thrown out windows and worse. If I were going to point fingers -- and I am -- Id suggest the first mistake was in jettisoning the original writers. Jon Lucas and Scott Moore who came up with the characters the idea and the story in the first place are now relegated to ""character credit"" and cashing checks Im sure.Initially director Todd Phillips seemed to know what he was doing -- that the best way to handle all the outrageousness was to be even more outrageous. It worked.Phillips stayed to direct the Wolfpacks disappointing wedding trip to Thailand for 2011s ""Part II."" And hes the man in charge of ""Part III."" Meanwhile the box office along with the myth that the ""Hangover"" is still funny has hung on long after the comedy has left the building.PHOTOS Summer Sneaks 2013Phillips and Craig Mazin co-wrote the three-quel dropping Scot Armstrong who helped them with the dirty work on ""Part II."" Since Phillips name keeps turning up like a bad penny lets put the blame for the down-slide on his shoulders. In fact lets send him to the Bangkok prison where ""The Hangover Part III"" begins.Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) is incarcerated inside its ancient walls and as things get underway the inmates are in full rebellion. Toilet paper beds guards basically anything within reach is raining down. By the time we see Chow hes racing through the tunnels that snake their way under the prison. Sewage is involved.Something has to be concocted to get the guys back together and us to the theater. Instead of a wedding its an intervention to get Alan into rehab in Arizona. There are problems as soon as they hit the road most significantly a kidnapping with Justin Bartha reprising his missing persons role as Doug.The conflict comes in the form of a series of detours. Chow has taken a bunch of gold from a mob guy named Marshall (John Goodman). Because of Alans connection to the Asian outlaw -- theres a trail of prison letters -- Marshall is threatening to kill Doug in three days if they dont deliver Chow and the gold.Jeongs time with the Wolfpack has been well spent turning him into one of Hollywoods highest profile punch lines -- a featured player in seven films this year alone and a series regular on NBCs ""Community."" It has also made him perhaps the most visible Asian actor since Jackie Chan Bruce Lee and Jet Li kicked their way into the game which only underscores the difficulty for rising male talents such as John Cho (""Star Trek"" ""Harold amp; Kumar"") who are trying to get beyond the stereotypes.Whatever ""The Hangover"" has done for Jeong it is equally telling what he has done for the franchise. His sideshow-freak Mr. Chow has become the main attraction in ""Part III."" Like the Demerol that Stu is forced to dispense many times in the next hour or so Chow is much better in very small doses.PHOTOS Hollywood backlot momentsBefore the smoke clears there will be a run-in with the Mexican police a reconnection with former hooker Jade (Heather Graham) a flirtation with a Vegas pawn broker (Melissa McCarthy) yet another wedding and yet another morning-after in which Stus body once again serves as a reminder of how bad things got. Galifianakis the comic gift in the first keeps on giving. Just not as generously. Still what humor there is to be found in ""Part III"" is due to that innocent idiocy he embodies in the 42-year-old man-child of Alan.For the most part though the Wolfpack has grown meaner over time. Coopers main job except for one cool stunt atop Caesars Palace is to look good drop F-bombs and scowl. Helms role is to remain angry and insecure about the whole dentist-versus-doctor thing. Chow if possible is more bitter than ever. If old friends have to be sacrificed to keep Marshalls fortune so be it.Come to think of it Chow is actually an apt metaphor for the movie -- indescribably irritating and only in it for the money.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com-------------------------------------The Hangover Part IIIMPAA rating R for pervasive language including sexual references some violence and drug content brief graphic nudityRunning time 1 hour 40 minutesPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Weddings Movies Zach Galifianakis The Hangover (movie) Bradley Cooper Mike Tyson Zach Galifianakis thrills fans at Hangover Part III premiere Bradley Cooper on living with his mom Theres no other choice Report Justin Bartha of The Hangover engaged to Lia Smith Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad76deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-mn-hangover-part-iii-20130523,0,6184496.story?track=rss&utm_source=feedly",200,thehangoverpartiii18,thehangoverpartiii,latimes

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Setting aside the rampant sexism broad racial caricatures and unfunny Mike Tyson cameos the most irksome thing about the Hangover films may be the gimmick that drives them. What could be less exciting and less cinematic than three hapless dudes spending an entire movie being told about the mischief they got into the night before? (No surprise that the photo montages during the end credits which deliver a few glimpses of genuine naughtiness earn the biggest laughs.) The best that can be said for the third supposedly final chapter is that it jettisons the retracing-our-steps scenario of the 2009 original and its 2011 carbon-copy sequel. There is in other words no hangover in The Hangover Part III. And yet a sense of creative dehydration still pervades. ""I will never change"" declares Zach Galifianakis crazed man-child at his fathers funeral. The line feels like a mission statement a permanent pledge from Todd Phillips the franchises mastermind to keep churning out frat-friendly lowbrow odysseys. In his latest the mayhem commences with a road trip as Bradley Coopers exasperated preppie Ed Helms nervous dentist and Justin Barthas incidental fourth wheel push an off-his-meds Galifianakis to a mental-health clinic. Their plans go south quickly when a bellowing kingpin (John Goodman) takes Bartha hostage promising his safe return only on the condition that the ""Wolfpack"" tracks down series co-star Ken Jeong whos ripped Goodman off. Sending its trio of travelers to Tijuana and then on to more familiar stomping grounds The Hangover Part III tweaks its predecessors formula only marginally. As usual there arent so much jokes as zany setpieces Jeong performing an atonal rendition of Trent Reznors ""Hurt"" the boys dangling from a high building a whole menagerie of animals--dogs chickens one unlucky giraffe--meeting ghastly ends. ""Outrageous"" remains a poor substitute for funny. Perhaps aware that everyone involved is essentially going through the motions Phillips amuses himself by spoofing action movies; the opening scene in which Jeong escapes from the Bangkok slammer during a prison riot is the most entertaining example. The actors meanwhile just look bored. Fresh off his revelatory turn in last years Silver Linings Playbook Cooper cant even muster the asshole peevishness he brought to the last two installments. Helms too seems to be in pure check-cashing mode summoning not a single hissy fit. (Thats perhaps a relief; his hysterical performance in Part II was a bit much.) Only Galifianakis granted a love interest in Melissa McCarthys pawnshop owner seems committed to the films cause. His shtick still works even as seeing the character win over a lady--any lady--is about as believable as Phillips claims that this will be the last Hangover movie.

What happened in Vegas shouldve stayed in Vegas By Mary Pols MaryPolsMay 22 2013 Share Read Later Send to Kindle Melinda Sue Gordon / Warner Bros. Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture Todd Phillips deliberately offensive films have always courted controversy but The Hangover Part III marks a tonal shift for his successful franchise. The movie is so aggressively nasty and barely funny that it feels as though Phillips is trying to cull his own Wolfpack down to only the most hardcore fans. The tagline on The Hangover Part IIIs posters is ""The end"" and there may be some wish fulfillment implied. The Hangover Part III gives off such a stench of creative decay that it hardly seems possible that even Phillips or his co-writers have any use for the movie themselves. If a movie can be self-loathing and self-destructive its this one. Even the impetus behind the journey which does include a trip back to Las Vegas the scene of the wickedly fun original is bleak. Instead of a rollicking bachelor party enhanced by drugs theres a funeral followed by an intervention. Alan (Zach Galifianakis) has been off his meds for six months when the movie begins. He is enticed to enter a treatment facility in Arizona by a promise that Phil (Bradley Cooper) and the rest of the Wolfpack -- Stu (Ed Helms) and the guy who always gets left behind Alans brother-in-law Doug (Justin Bartha) -- will drive him there. Of course the trip to Arizona is derailed -- and the purpose of it completely forgotten -- by an encounter with a drug-lord-type named Marshall (John Goodman) and his henchmen including ""Black Doug"" from the first film. Marshall demands the guys find and bring him Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) who double-crossed him around the time of the first Hangover. (MORE Proof That Our Reviewer Took Some Pleasure in The Hangover Franchise in the Past) Alans specific mental-health issue has remained vague throughout the series but whatever it is it leads to some spectacularly dunderheaded and mean behavior. In his first scene in The Hangover Part III Alan drives down the freeway pulling a wagon with a giraffe upright in it. Its his new pet. The giraffe is obviously almost entirely computer-generated but still looks smart soulful friendly. It is decapitated by an overpass and the severed head plunges nose first into the windshield of an approaching car. The preview audience I was with seemed stunned into silence. Not by what had happened -- the outcome is telegraphed from the beginning of the scene -- but by a sort of larger why? Hardly anyone laughed. What a contrast to the hilarity of the sight gag of that tiger in the bathroom of the Vegas hotel in the original movie. Even the abused penis-nibbling monkey in The Hangover Part II seems slightly amusing in comparison. The dead giraffe served no purpose except to be grossly provocative. As oily pretty-boy Phil Cooper demonstrated in the two earlier movies an uncanny ability to make almost any line funny but here hes reached his limits. Its not Coopers fault but the screenwriters. No one not Ernie Kovacs or Johnny Carson or Mel Brooks or even Chris Rock could make Phils line ""Oh come on he killed a giraffe. Who gives a [expletive]?"" funny. Other jokes that fail involve the cruel ends of a pair of guard dogs and some chickens trained for cockfighting and fueled on a diet of cocaine. They are variously shot smothered drugged etc. (MORE Joel Steins Interview With Zach Galifianakis and Will Ferrell) The threat to the dogs even causes the cynical Phil to protest. ""I didnt know you worked for PETA"" says Mr. Chow (Jeong reprising his role from the earlier films). ""What a [expletive]."" Maybe that line is supposed to make the audience feel chagrined about being such softies as well but it isnt witty enough to work. I suppose the dumb beasts give the steadily ridiculed character of Mr. Chow someone to look down on. Homophobia and underlying racism directed at Asians permeate this movie just as they did the others with the ambiguously sexed Mr. Chow -- he had or has a wife but like Alan cant stop drooling over handsome Phil -- subject to considerable verbal abuse. Despite everything Jeong has turned playing Mr. Chow into some strange art form. He gives the character radical style and confidence; no wonder Mr. Chow has become the central figure in The Hangover Part III. Phillips perhaps couldnt make another movie without him (although blessedly that promise that this is ""the end"" does seem serious). The impish outrageous mischief maker is the only force propelling the movie forward unless you count the romantic subplot involving Galifianakis Alan and Melissa McCarthys pawn-shop proprietor which is of a piece with the usual insulting mainstream grotesquerie involving the sexuality of the overweight. The Hangover Part III is such a misery that when Mr. Chow directs the Wolfpack to ""stay low like dog"" it might as well be the films motto.

Pictures) The good news is that Ed Helms doesnt wake up in a Tijuana brothel with an amputated leg and a donkey in the room. The bad news is that youll wish he had.""The Hangover Part III"" is the second sequel to the highest-grossing R-rated comedy of all time. Whereas the first sequel was a tasteless regurgitation of the memory-loss formula this one is like bottling the backwash and slapping familiar faces on the label.Those faces are alpha-dog Phil (Bradley Cooper) sensible dentist Stu (Helms) and uncensored idiot Alan (Zach Galifianakis). Theyre like the Kirk Spock and Scotty of this enterprise with Ken Jeong as the unstoppable alien and poor Justin Bartha as the faceless crewman who gets used as cannon fodder. In this episode an evil warlord from planet Vegas (John Goodman) kidnaps Doug (Bartha) to force the rest of the Wolfpack to hunt down the fugitive Mr. Chow (Jeong) who stole a stash of the bad guys gold.The caper entails Alans making a date with his pen-pal Chow on the lawless side of the U.S.-Mexico border.While fans of the franchise might expect an orgy of coke snorting and cock fighting the trip to Tijuana is as dull as refried beans garnished with a limp twist that takes the gang back to Sin City for more moronic high jinks. Part of the fun of the first movie was the looming idea that these regular guys had wives and jobs that were jeopardized by their misbehavior. But here the characters are cardboard cutouts placed into predicaments that arent remotely real. Or funny.Jeong gets a long leash to sniff around the party-animal stereotype and Galifianakis milks the absurdity from Alans digressions and non sequiturs; but without a narrative hook they cant salvage such an unimaginative script. Comedy connoisseurs and theater owners will always fondly remember ""The Hangover"" but continuing to roll the dice on this bankrupted franchise has produced craps.What ""The Hangover Part III""  One and a half stars out of four  Rating R  Run time 140  Content Strong language some violence sexual references and brief nudity Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

Credit Warner Brothers Pictures The Wolfpack rides again. Or rather it limps exhaustedly over the tundra in what is billed as the final edition of the ""Hangover"" trilogy. Defanged with glazed eyes and creaking joints these superannuated party animals try vainly to stir up some enthusiasm during a return visit to Las Vegas the site of the first ""Hangover"" movie. But their heart isnt in it.As the expectant audience at the screening I attended waited for ""The Hangover Part III"" to explode into action with the usual lewd gross-out antics only a few scattered laughs could be heard along with much grumbling after the final credits. For ""The Hangover Part III"" directed by Todd Phillips from a screenplay he wrote with Craig Mazin is a dull lazy walkthrough that along with ""The Big Wedding"" has a claim to be the years worst star-driven movie.In case you need to be reminded or somehow missed the earlier editions the Wolfpack includes Phil (Bradley Cooper) Doug (Justin Bartha) Stu (Ed Helms) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) four of the unlikeliest on-the verge-of-middle-age buddies ever to join forces in search of adventure. Phil is the charmer Doug the straight arrow Stu the square and Alan the infantile id.""The Hangover Part III"" concentrates more on Alan than the earlier movies did and on their troublemaking sometime sidekick and nemesis the whiny-voiced sociopathic Asian gangster Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong). An early scene in which Alan is speeding home in his sports car with a giraffe in an attached trailer promises more comedy than is subsequently delivered. As Alan reaches an underpass his long-necked pet is decapitated and the accident causes a traffic pileup. It is the first of several acts of cruelty to animals. Dogs are shot and a coked-up chicken is smothered. Photo From left Mr. Galifianakis Ken Jeong Mr. Helms and Mr. Cooper. Credit Melinda Sue Gordon/Warner Brothers Pictures After the giraffe mishap the other Wolfpack members stage an intervention to which Alan reluctantly agrees. While taking him to a rehab center they are intercepted by a hulking mobster named Marshall (John Goodman) and his goons wearing pig masks. Marshall blames Chow for stealing millions of dollars of gold bricks and takes Doug as a hostage until Chow is brought to him along with the gold.The story awkwardly zigzags to Mexico and back. When the guys discover that Chow is in Las Vegas holed up in a heavily guarded penthouse suite with drugs and escorts at Caesars Palace they re-enter Sin City -- where all their troubles began -- and try to capture him. These Las Vegas adventures are a sequence of perfunctory stunts entering the penthouse from the roof on tied-together sheets Chows escaping by parachute and the tedious chasing that pads out the movie. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In the most amusing scene set in Las Vegas Alan and Cassie (Melissa McCarthy in a cameo role as a mean-spirited pawnbroker) make goo-goo eyes at each other in a grotesque flirtation that involves the passing of a red lollipop from one mouth into another. The most strained and lifeless moment brings back Heather Grahams character from the first ""Hangover"" simply as a reference.At their best the earlier ""Hangover"" movies were anarchic absurdist farces descended from Abbott and Costello the Three Stooges and the Hope-Crosby road movies but with a libido inflamed by drugs and booze. In the spirit of those forerunners the members of the Wolfpack may age but they never learn from experience. One excuse for their naivete is that most of their mayhem takes place while they are blind drunk. Their hangovers seem to last only a few minutes before theyre up and running.But the toll has been severe on the series if not the characters. Only in a sight gag during the final credits is there a momentary flare-up of the old antic spirit. Otherwise ""The Hangover Part III"" is dead.Goodbye and good riddance.""The Hangover Part III"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for strong language brief nudity and violence.

VPC Claudia Puig USA TODAY 1023 a.m. EDT May 23 2013The third film in the comedy franchise is a weak brew of tired ideas.Zach Galifianakis Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms return for Hangover Part III.(Photo Melinda Sue Gordon)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY review  1/2 stars out of fourStars Bradley Cooper Ed Helms John Goodman Ken Jeong Zach GalifianakisRated R; Runtime 100 minutes; Opens Thursday nationwide""Leslie Chow is madness"" says John Goodmans crime boss in assessing Ken Jeongs maniacally cackling and ever-grating character in The Hangover Part III.But thats hardly a good reason to center a movie on him.When the franchises ""Wolfpack"" come into Chows orbit ""bad things happen and people get hurt"" says Alan (Zach Galifianakis).Chows response ""Yes thats the point. Its funny.""Its not however. And thats the biggest problem with The Hangover Part III ( 1/2 out of four; rated R; opens Thursday nationwide).This sequel makes a major tactical error by focusing excessively on the most outlandish -- and least comical-- character from the previous films. Its more a road movie with action elements than a comedy and the debauchery of the first two films is missing. Since the guys arent stuck in Vegas drunk or drugged their willingness to go on a wild adventure doesnt ring true. Wrongheaded attempts at humor abound. For starters theres a decapitated giraffe.STORY No cure for Hangover stars appealREVIEW Ken Jeong sees cinematic feast as Mr. ChowPREMIERE Cooper Hangover end is bittersweetGUIDE USA TODAYs summer movie calendarREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYThe core characters from the previous films -- Alan Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Stu ( Ed Helms) -- are tasked with tracking down Chow who absconded with 21 million in gold bars that belong to Marshall (Goodman).If they dont bring him back Marshall will kill their beleaguered buddy Doug (Justin Bartha) the groom-to-be who was mostly AWOL from the first film. He has almost as little screen time here.Hes the lucky one.After staging an intervention the guys are taking Alan to a rehab center called New Horizons. Who knew that there was rehab for childish thick-headed fools?But Alan never makes it there. They get sidetracked by Goodman and his goons who accost them on the highway. Doug is held hostage and the pack is forced to detour to Tijuana to find Chow and his bounty.As Chow Jeong sings bad karaoke and keeps killer chickens in his hotel room. What he neglects to do is be funny. The comedy quotient is also missing from his antics involving a parade of hookers the slaughter of guard dogs and a cocaine-fueled parachute ride where he sings I Believe I Can Fly.Nothing about this rote exercise feels remotely fresh. Its a re-tread of the 2009 original sans the inspired lunacy.It was that inventive insanity that made the first Hangover so much fun. But the players seem like theyre going through the motions here. Cooper and Helms spend their time reacting or making wan snide remarks. Galifianakis tries a bit harder but Alans strangeness is more distracting than comical. He does however get to have a romance with Cassie (Melissa McCarthy) who is essentially the female version of Alan.References to the previous films pop up frequently serving both as padding for the thin plot and reminders of how the series has gone wrong.Much as the studio actors and comedy-seeking audience would like it to be otherwise The Hangover was a one-hit wonder. 50 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 9 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/197qm7P",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/05/22/hangover-3-review/2107107/?utm_source=feedly&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+UsatodaycomMovies-TopStories+%28Life+-+Movies+-+Top+Stories%29,200,thehangoverpartiii25,thehangoverpartiii,usatoday

RELATED NEWS Interview Ken Jeong By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Wed May 22 2013 1031 AM Remember how when ""The Hangover Part II"" came out in 2011 everyone thought it was a mistake a craven misguided attempt to cash in on the surprisingly enormous success of the original? Turns out it wasnt a mistake. It was genius. Bravo Todd Phillips who again co-wrote and directs. By dropping the expectations below whatevers beneath the basement ""The Hangover Part III"" had to look good in comparison. And it does. But only in comparison. Otherwise its an unnecessary movie with some funny parts and a few callbacks to the original as if visiting Las Vegas for a bit might bring back some of the original magic. It doesnt but at least this time it seems like theyre trying. A little at least. Death brought about at least in part by stupidity brings the Wolfpack together again. I wont spoil it by telling you who or what that involves but the word ""stupidity"" should be a big hint. This leads to Phil (Bradley Cooper) Stu (Ed Helms) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) once again having a reason to set off on an adventure to take Alan to rehab in Arizona though I was not aware previously that you could rehabilitate someone for just being kind of an idiot. And once again events conspire to knock Doug (Justin Bartha) out of the picture for most of the movie. That happens when the gang gets sidetracked on the way to Arizona. Kidnapped you might say by a shady character named Marshall (John Goodman). He has Black Doug (Mike Epps) working for him but Black Doug is not the only person from the gangs past whos involved in the story It turns out that Marshall has a longtime score to settle with Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) whose dealings with the Wolfpack in the first movie set in motion a chain of events that lead them to Mexico and to ... Seriously does it matter? No it does not. These are likable actors all of them. Good actors. Check out Coopers Oscar-nominated turn in ""Silver Linings Playbook"" for instance. Its just that every character trait from the first two movies is on display again without any sort of progression. Phil is still the handsome brains of the operation; Stu the wet blanket. Alan is still aggressive in his stupidity; Doug mostly absent. Phillips seems uninterested in getting anything else out of them. That said Galifianakis can still milk absurdity for laughs mostly in throwaway lines involving his weird take on the world. And the scene in which he flirts with Melissa McCarthy who plays a pawnshop worker who turns out to be his soul mate is unsavory fun. What has changed since the franchise started is the ascension of Mr. Chow as a focal point of the films. Hes as unhinged as Alan (which makes them kindred spirits and friends) only more dangerous. Jeong who was once a physician (really) can be really funny but these films tend to stretch his comedic gifts to the breaking point and like everything else they touch keep steamrolling on. David Letterman used to espouse a theory of comedy that if you kept going at the same joke again and again either it would become unbearable or hilarious. If you needed proof of that theory at least the former portion of it ""The Hangover III"" provides all that youll need. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr HAIR OF THE DOG Justin Bartha Zach Galifianakis Ed Helms and Bradley Cooper return each taking a little bit from each previous Hangover to finish off the trilogy (Warner Bros) B- The Hangover Part III Genre Comedy; Starring Bradley Cooper Zach Galifianakis Ed Helms; Director Todd Phillips; Release Date Wide 05/24/2013; Runtime (in minutes) 100; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted June 6 2013 -- 1200 AM EDT For a franchise known for pushing boundaries The Hangover Part III isnt nearly outrageous enough. In his wild 2009 original Todd Phillips goosed the stale men-behaving-badly formula giving it a rude hard-R twist. But his Bangkok-set 2011 follow-up felt like a road trip on cruise control. I dont know why but I came to the latest (and final) chapter with bullish optimism. It seemed like a perfect chance for a course correction tapping back into the first films whacked-out Wolfpack spirit. Oh well. Hangover III is Alans story. Played again by the manic potbellied elf Zach Galifianakis Alan has decided to go off his meds which results in some bad decisions (even for him) including a joyride with an ill-fated giraffe. An intervention is staged and its up to Phil (Bradley Cooper) Stu (Ed Helms whose Maori face tattoo has been lasered off) and Doug (Justin Bartha quickly sidelined again) to take him to rehab in Arizona. During a pit stop in Vegas they hook up with some familiar faces Mike Epps Black Doug Heather Grahams Jade Ken Jeongs Mr. Chow. Theyre also introduced to Marshall (John Goodman) an ascot-wearing heavy who forces the boys to track down Chow and recover 21 million in gold bars that the cocaine-fueled imp has stolen. Mild mayhem ensues. Part caper part coming-of-adulthood story Hangover III never settles into a debauched groove. As a Sin City romp its too tame. And as a ""very special"" ode to Alans journey to responsibility its a miscalculation of what fans want from a series featuring a smoking monkey. That said you should stick around for the end credits because theres a Helms sight gag thats absolutely priceless. The movie couldve used more laughs like that one.

The well dries up so to speak and for a prime example you need look no further than ""The Hangover 2 Copy / Paste Edition"". For the thing that made the original ""Hangover"" great non-linear innovation was the very thing that made ""The Hangover II"" poor there was nothing resembling innovation. So it gives me great pleasure to report that ""The Hangover Part III"" doesnt suffer from the same problem and it is funny and huzzah who doesnt love a summer comedy done right? If the three films were boxers ""The Hangover"" would be Mike Tyson full of tremendous uppercuts while ""The Hangover 2"" would be Michael Spinks only good for about 90 seconds of entertainment. ""The Hangover Part III""? Evander Holyfield steady and solid though still slightly battle worn and ear torn. Fair warning ""The Hangover Part III"" starts off on a discordant note though thankfully its about as unfunny as the film gets. Alan (Zach Galifianakis) has purchased a giraffe and for some reason hes towing it behind his car leading to an eventual (and completely predictable) sight gag. This sort of idiocy is almost without precedent in the series as the ""Hangover"" series has been embedded with the gritty realism of drug-induced bad decisions and seedy environments. This giraffe angle was almost as if someone had this idea back in their 6th grade creative writing class and finally saw a way to make that dream come true. Nothing about this makes sense you cant buy a giraffe in the United States and even if you could you certainly couldnt tow it behind your convertible like some kind of giant moronic rube. The scene is meant to convey Alans dip into crazy but all of the audience here is credentialed weve been pre-dipped into Alan and sorry for your luck if you somehow missed the first film. And really if there is a problem with the ""The Hangover Part III"" it comes surprisingly in the form of Alan a character who has been utilized well up until this point. They stay with Alan about one beat too long for almost every joke and they lose a little momentum each and every time they do it. Also check out ""The Hangover Part III"" and Hollywoods Struggle with Intellectual Disabilities Fortunately the rest of the film proceeds nicely well-paced and with steady barrage of laughs. The character of Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) is handled particularly well this time around hes still fit for a loony bin but his personality is developed a bit more and he exhibits a baseline competence that makes his life as a gangster entirely more plausible. Enter John Goodman (as Marshall) - hes got serious beef with Chow and he ""enlists"" the wolfpack to assist him in asset recovery. Heres where the film will start winning you over mostly because there are two ""Big Lebowski"" callbacks from John Goodman and a movie cant ever go wrong with those. Also on the plus side director Todd Phillips continues to deliver great soundtracks and his films are greatly augmented by the tone set when hes leaning hard on pop music. From Fred Neils ""Everybodys Talking at Me"" to ""Can We Get Much Higher?"" by Kanye West ""The Hangover Part III"" is drenched in music but in a good way. Additionally Carlos and the Bandidos provide maximum impact with ""Down in Mexico"" and the iconic Johnny Cash version of ""Hurt"" is revived and much as with Jeff Becks take on ""Hallelujah"" it never fails to haunt and in this case cajole strange uncomfortable laughs from the audience. Which leads us to another factor really working in ""The Hangover Part III"" the overall oddness of the film. There are moments of true depravity here that rival anything seen in mainstream cinema. Frankly I dont know how some of them made it past the MPAA even in an R-rated movie. These moments do land however mostly because theyre so unexpected. ""The Hangover III"" somehow pulls off the dual trick of being sentimental and yet the darkest of the franchise a nice little trick that leads to a fine finale. Quirkiness doesnt always work just look at ""The Big Wedding"" but when its laced with this much pathos it creates a sense of fluidity rarely found in comedic efforts. One quick note on the title of the film theres again no hangover to be found in the film. And really since the opening scenes of ""The Hangover"" there havent been alcohol-induced issues unless you count a purposeful drugging of the gang which is a stretch. If anything these films will be remembered as ""The Alan and Chow Show"" or even ""Wolfpackin"" but I suppose they had to keep the original title once the first one cashed in worldwide. Yeah this is a ticky-tac complaint but as there wont be a fourth version it should probably go on the record for posterity if only so that future generations dont think theyre getting a boozy movie here. Minuscule issues aside ""The Hangover Part III"" has at least 85 (out of 100) strong minutes. Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms continue to provide huge amounts of levity within the ensemble while Melissa McCarthy provides a smallish cameo that places unorthodox comedy front and center. Can we get much higher? In the case of ""The Hangover III"" Id argue we cant. The franchise is sent off in style a reminder of why it earned such praise and affection in the first place the wolfpack giving us one final howl at the moon. SCORE 7.7 / 10 Laremy wrote the book on film criticism and probably hasnt even had three hangovers in his entire life so perhaps hes not the best person to pass judgment.

Photo Credit Warner Bros. Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Haunted by past misdeeds the Wolfpack must return to Las Vegas. (R for pervasive language including sexual references some violence and drug content and brief graphic nudity) BOTTOM LINE The comedy franchise nails its coffin shut with this dark violent sour-humored kiss-off. CAST Zach Galifianakis Bradley Cooper Ed Helms DIRECTOR Todd Phillips LENGTH 140 It begins with a bloody decapitation continues with a man grinning through his fathers funeral then proceeds to fill car trunks and swimming pools with lifeless bodies. Its ""The Hangover Part III"" billed as the end of a trilogy that began with 2009s rollicking comedy ""The Hangover"" and it seems to have one goal to be so dark nasty and joyless that audiences wont want Part IV. Remember the freewheeling Wolfpack with Bradley Cooper as cowboy-cool Phil Ed Helms as nerdy dentist Stu and Zach Galifianakis as the addled manchild Alan? Theyre here but its as if all the substances theyve ingested over the years have curdled in their systems making them tired and cranky. Alan has lost his pure-hearted nature and has become a sociopath. He sets the movies creepy tone early by playing Billy Joels ""My Life"" while his father (Jeffrey Tambor) dies of a heart attack. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Alans deepening psychosis brings the Wolfpack back together to stage an intervention though its interrupted by crime boss Marshall (an ice-cold John Goodman) who wants them to track down their old frenemy Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong). It seems Chow stole some gold and Marshall is holding Alans brother-in-law Doug (Justin Bartha) until he gets it. What follows is a queasy combination of black comedy and bleak crime-thriller. Chow once such a wildly flamboyant presence is now a jittery sweaty criminal who mostly murders animals. Theres precious little slapstick in the violence and all the jokes feel strangely hostile. Melissa McCarthy plays a pawnshop owner who bonds with Alan because they both hate their mothers (hers is disabled). Returning director Todd Phillips who co-wrote with Craig Mazin (""The Hangover Part II"") wipes the smiles from his audiences faces so thoroughly that his perversity is almost admirable. Rarely has such a beloved comedy franchise been so coldly put to death. The closest equivalent might be when cartoonist Robert Crumb killed Fritz the Cat with an icepick to the head. 205 MoviesThe Hangover Part III trailer As if to hammer home the emptiness ""The Hangover Part III"" ends without the familiar montage of wild-and-crazy Polaroids.

Pictures The third times no charm. TWITTER The third installment of director Todd Phillips phenomenally popular series finds Zach Galifianakis Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms back in Vegas. There are two deaths within the first five minutes of The Hangover Part III.  One of them will not be described here since it involves a minor plot surprise.  But the other is worth mentioning.  Alan the nerdy character played by Zach Galifianakis is driving home with a giraffe in a trailer attached to his sports car. Since the animal has to duck under a couple of freeway underpasses it isnt hard to guess what might happen next. The poor creature is graphically decapitated causing a massive freeway pileup. ""This is an early sign of the movies desperation.  PETA and other animal lovers should be warned as there are a few other dead animals on the horizon. Hangover III is so determined to defy political correctness that it breaks one of the last cinematic taboos. Any schlockmeister can slaughter hundreds of people on camera but how many filmmakers dare to kill dogs other mammals and even smother a rooster? THR COVER The Uncensored Oral History of The Hangover But this cavalier attitude toward the killing of animals is just about the only eyebrow-raising touch in an otherwise tame and pallid climax to the Hangover trilogy. Young viewers looking for unbridled raunch will be sadly disappointed and so will other moviegoers expecting more than a few wan chuckles. This picture is like a brightly colored balloon with all the comic air seeping out. The first Hangover was honestly outrageous and frequently hilarious but its worth remembering that it also had a very clever story devised by screenwriters Jon Lucas and Scott Moore.  Part II which was co-written by the director of all three films Todd Phillips was bigger but not better though it did have a few memorable jolts of lewd crude humor. Part III is a step further down and there were very few laughs from the young male viewers recruited at the screening I attended. That wont hurt the initial box office numbers which will be huge but word of mouth may kick in and puncture the grosses after the first weekend. As the giraffe scene indicates the new movie opens by suggesting that Alan is in serious need of help. With the instigation of his family the other members of the Wolfpack--Phil (Bradley Cooper) Stu (Ed Helms) and Doug (Justin Bartha)--decide to stage an intervention and drive him to a rehab facility in Arizona. They dont get too far into the desert when they are stopped by a menacing mobster named Marshall (John Goodman) who blames them for the theft of some gold bars that were stolen from him by the Asian gangster Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) who has bedeviled the pals since the first movie. The ever hapless Doug is taken hostage and to save his life the other three have to find Chow and the gold.  And so the mayhem begins. PHOTOS The Hangover Part III Exclusive Portraits of Bradley Cooper Zach Galifianakis Their quest takes them to a mansion in Mexico a jail in Tijuana and eventually back to Las Vegas where their adventures started. At a pawnshop in Sin City Alan meets his soulmate played by Melissa McCarthy in a cameo that is one of the movies only bright spots. The other cast members seem to be just going through the motions. After his Oscar-nominated turn in Silver Linings Playbook and his even deeper performance in The Place Beyond the Pines Cooper doesnt have to do much heavy lifting here. He still manages to be charming and Galifianakis trots out his typical dorky shtick with some aplomb. But Helms is surprisingly lackluster on this outing and Jeong was more startlingly funny in the earlier installments. The Hangover series has never offered much opportunity to its female performers. Heather Graham returns but her new incarnation as pregnant hausfrau is completely unrewarding. There is one spectacular stunt which forces Phil and Alan to dangle from the roof of Caesars Palace. Otherwise the visuals are as flat as the script. Sequels are rarely rewarding but this sorry retread of a once inspired comedy only confirms the bankruptcy of sequel mania. At least its fairly short and although a bizarre end-credit sequence seems to be opening the door for another chapter the filmmakers have promised that this will be the end of The Hangover. We can only hope.

"Review The Hangover Part III short on laughs - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview The Hangover Part III short on laughsBy Charlie McCollumcmccollummercurynews.comPosted 05/22/2013 100000 AM PDTUpdated 05/22/2013 052731 PM PDT In Theaters This Week Get showtimes watch movie trailers Opened Thursday The Hangover Part III Opening Friday Fast amp; The Furious 6 Epic Epic 3D What Maisie Knew Frances Ha Related StoriesMay 21Bradley Coopers success leaves him more tipsy than hungover (interview)Back in 2009 ""The Hangover"" became the highest-grossing R-rated comedy ever made. The film was rude and crude and took the concept of political incorrectness to new heights but it was also smart character-driven and hysterically funny. It ended up being ranked by many as one of the best movies of the year and should have received at least some Oscar recognition.Its very hard to remember that as you sit watching ""The Hangover Part III"" which may stand as the ultimate cautionary tale of the dangers of trying to turn certain successful films into long-running franchises. What was a brilliant bit of comedy has now been dragged out stretched and strained to near the breaking point with some very good actors becoming increasingly disengaged from the material and their characters. This film image shows Zach Galifianakis in a scene from ""The Hangover Part III."" (Melinda Sue Gordon/Warner Bros. Pictures) With ""The Hangover Part II"" director/co-writer Todd Phillips was smacked around by critics for essentially doing a lazy remake mechanically reprising all the rhythms and high notes of the original. So this time around the director takes a completely different tack turning ""Hangover"" into a caper film involving elaborate robberies car chases and a rooftop break-in at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. Its almost as if Phillips has decided that the ""Wolfpack"" -- Alan (Zach Galifianakis) Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Stu (Ed Helms) -- has morphed into Oceans Three.Advertisement All of the conventions of the earlier films (the hangovers the flashbacks) have been eliminated in favor of a loopy narrative but along the way Phillips has lost all of the sharp humor keen sense of debauchery and just plain fun that marked the original. There are stabs at gross-out comedy but even those moments (youve probably seen the giraffe on the freeway bit in the trailers) come off as perfunctory.The plot as slim as it is goes something like this The effeminate gangster Mr. Chow (the irrepressible Ken Jeong) breaks out of prison in Thailand while the Wolfpack is called to an intervention with man-child Alan who has gone off his meds and gone full psychopath rather than just wild-and-crazy guy. While taking in Alan for psychiatric treatment they get bushwhacked by a crime boss named Marshall (John Goodman) who thinks they can help him get 20 million in gold that Mr. Chow stole from him around the time of the original movie.Marshall takes Alans brother-in-law Doug (Justin Bartha) hostage until the Wolfpackers can retrieve the gold. That leads to a road trip to Tijuana and eventually and inevitably back to Las Vegas where the first film was set.Perhaps the biggest problem with the film is that it focuses on Alan and the crazed Mr. Chow both fan favorites but also characters best taken in small doses. Cooper who has gone on to much bigger roles since the first ""Hangover"" and Helms are basically there as straight men which may partly account for how detached the two actors seem throughout the movie.There is only one scene that really harks back to what ""The Hangover"" was. That comes toward the end when Melissa McCarthy turns up as a wonderfully vile Las Vegas pawnshop owner and has a moment with Alan that is just priceless. For at least a few minutes the humor is honest and not forced.At one point in the film Alan turns to Mr. Chow and says ""When we get together bad things happen.""To which Chow replies ""Yeah its funny.""Well actually Mr. Chow it was funny -- and its not anymore.For film news and more follow Charlie McCollum at Twitter.com/charlie_mccollu.THE HANGOVER PART iii  1/2Rating R (for language sexual content some violence and nudity)Cast Bradley Cooper Zach Galifianakis Ed Helms and Ken JeongDirector Todd PhillipsRunning time 1 hour 40 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Review Holocaust haunts family in The GatheringReview In Hearts of Palm bumbling corporation aims to plunder paradiseReview In Bad Moms fast food and booze spike the stress of motherhood Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

Pictures The good news is that ""The Hangover Part III"" isnt a rerun like the second episode. The bad news is everything else. For all the promise of mayhem and WTF moments the final episode hits you with all the force of a warm can of ODouls. When basing your movie on four characters you really shouldnt have two of them (Bradley Coopers Phil Ed Helms Stu) stand around being boring and reacting to things. As for the uselessly strange Zach Galifianakis who hasnt made me laugh since 2007 his Alan is stupid in boring ways while even the talented Ken Jeong can do nothing with Chow the laboriously wacky Chinese guy who serves as the fuse on this soggy firecracker of a movie. Theres no spree/hangover this time just a failed intervention during which the fellas try to take Alan to a rehab clinic (they have that for a case of dumbass?). Instead all are kidnapped by a gangster (John Goodman) linked to the dealer who sold Alan drugs in the first film. John Goodman in ""The Hangover Part III"" (Melinda Sue Gordon) Goodmans Marshall tells the guys that Alans friend Chow who has recently escaped from a Thai prison robbed him of 21 million in gold bricks (which according to this movie can be easily lugged around in three or four duffle bags but even more easily stolen from a sheik who brings it on a plane with him with less security than your average 7-Eleven). Marshall says if the Wolfpack doesnt bring him Chow hell kill their pal Doug who again is played by the woebegone nonentity Justin Bartha. In the three films combined he gets about as much screen time as Rebecca in ""Rebecca."" Chow is in Tijuana so the friends head to Mexico where Chow helps them break into a house he says he used to own where the gold is hidden (Though since its not actually his house its a mystery why he knows everything about it.) RELATED THE HANGOVER TOPS POST READERS FAVORITE BUDDY MOVIES LIST In the second half of the movie we bounce back to Vegas to rappel off the roof of Caesars Palace and chase a parachuting Chow. Randomly thrown in are ""trailer moments"" unconnected to anything Why is Alan driving down a freeway with a giraffe on a trailer and heading for a low underpass? No reason because that would require actual writing instead of comedy hacks sitting around asking each other ""Wouldnt this be off the hook?"" Why does Alan sing ""Ave Maria"" in a gorgeous soprano? See previous. Why do the kidnappers wear Porky Pig masks if theyre going to reveal themselves anyway? Ditto. I beg of you dont ask me to choose between ""Hangover"" II and III. That would be like asking a mother to choose between her children assuming she hated her children never wanted to see them again and wished theyd never been born in the first place. Part II was like being No. 68 for takeoff at LaGuardia on a parked plane with the air conditioning off while an overcaffeinated psychotic in the seat next to you keeps repeating himself. Part III is more like being a hundred feet from the punch bowl at your class reunion and trapped in the corner by the most insistently dull guy in your high school class as he regales you in pathetically vast detail about the habits of his extensive collection of pet ferrets.

Cocky Phil (Bradley Cooper) fidgety Stu (Ed Helms) and incorrigible Alan (Zach Galifianakis) stumble across the finish line of their misadventure trilogy in rare and raunchy form dragging the boundaries for perverse comedy along with them. The three bumbling amigos/sparring partners who bonded during an epic bender on a Vegas bachelor party come full circle here. Still cemented in their grudging love-hate for cuddly psycho Alan his buddies agree to carpool him to a sanitarium. Their intervention is interrupted by Mike Epps reprising his role as drug-dealing Black Doug and mob chief John Goodman who send the simpleton Sherlocks on a do-or-die mission to capture their old nemesis Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong). The fey ferocious gangster has evolved from a colorful footnote in the first film into a monster-clown in the tradition of Heath Ledgers Joker. Once again the misadventures involve Sin City debauchery casino rooftops drugs guns kidnapping call girls wrecked cars and chickens. Lots of chickens. ""The Hangover"" was a twisted mystery with the ill-matched amnesiacs trying to unearth what happened during the catastrophic night before when they tore up Sin City blasted on Jagermeister and roofies. This episode is a standard catch-the-fugitive chase. ""Memento""-style puzzles are unnecessary. The jagged interplay between the stars propels the movie. And this time writer-director Todd Phillips adds aggressively in-your-face gags about the homoerotic subtext of frat-boy humor. Cooper Helms and Galifianakis virtually unknown in 2009 became overnight stars with the original ""Hangover."" Now their characters are as well-established as the Three Stooges. Cooper the straight man of the group is loyal but with a timorous yellow streak that belies his action-hero looks. Helms is the prissy professional man of reason (not a dentist hell have you know but a doctor of dental science) suppressing a kinky side that erupts with absurd consequences. Warner Bros. From left Justin Bartha Zach Galfianakis Ed Helms and Bradley Cooper in ""The Hangover Part III."" The most original creation is Galifianakis stunted over-entitled rich boy. Still attached umbilically to his fathers money Alan is a snobbish hostile loser covering up his loneliness with macho bluster. Its a droll role spiced with just the right touch of melancholia. The trios kettle-on-fire of simmering exasperation boils over often and uproariously. Anyone whose best pals drive them crazy (most of us Im guessing) will identify. Melissa McCarthy shines as a Vegas pawnshop owner who just might be Alans match. Still its Jeong who owns the movie. As the mad hatter comic villain hes a seething volcano of absurdist malice. He doesnt just steal his scenes he holds them captive bound and gagged. Hang around for the now-traditional epilogue in the end credits and marvel at how far hes willing to go for a surreal gag. Colin Covert has covered films for the Star Tribune for 20 years interviewing Peter Jackson Kate Winslet Steven Spielberg Cate Blanchett Quentin Tarantino Neil Gaiman and John Travolta to name a few. Colins job as a film critic consists mostly of thinking up synonyms for ""mediocre."" He still gets a thrill when the lights dim and all too often a bigger thrill when they come on again.

To read the whole story subscribe to BostonGlobe.com THE HANGOVER PART III Share Comment ""The Hangover Part III"" doesnt bother to Xerox the original 2009 hit comedy as 2011s witless ""Hangover 2"" did. Instead it heads in different if utterly formulaic directions. So its not terrible. Its just bad. Ditching the morning-after-the-night-before gimmick the new film sends the ""Wolf Pack"" -- Bradley Cooper Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis -- out to locate antic Asian gangsta Ken Jeong so hell return crime kingpin John Goodmans stolen gold. Occasional chuckles leak out almost all of them due to Galifianakiss man-from-Mars line readings but far too much of ""Hangover Part III"" hangs on the notion that you find Jeongs pansy-pottymouth schtick funny and thats asking a lot.

They were shitty human beings who probably grew up to be like Ellis from Die Hard or EPA agent Walter Peck from Ghostbusters. We identified with the slobs because Americans like underdogs and also because the slobs were so often played by Bill Murray. But the snobs could be hilarious too--see for example every single line spoken by Ted Knight as Judge Smails in Caddyshack.Now the snobs have seized the cultural momentum and basically won the American economy. With The Hangover Part III director Todd Phillips continues to occupy an apt (and very lucrative) niche casting rich entitled fraternity dicks as underdog heroes beset by shrewish women foreigners with funny accents and even animals--often cute animals with big dewy eyes.Film Details The Hangover Part III RatingR GenreComedy Running Time100 More Info Trailer ""So he killed a giraffe--who gives a fuck?"" says Bradley Cooper in what amounts to a candid articulation of the trilogys worldview. Coopers Phil is defending the sub-neurotypical Alan (Zach Galifianakis) who has indeed beheaded an adorable giraffe.Unlike its predecessors The Hangover Part III doesnt open with the aftermath of a substance binge. Alan has quit taking unspecified meds causing him to behave like an enormous bastard. Following the death of his wealthy father and a family intervention the ""Apple Dumpling Gang""--sorry ""Wolf Pack""--agrees to accompany him on a cross-country road trip to a vaguely described inpatient psych facility.Theyre intercepted by the first films crime boss Black Doug (Mike Epps) and his boss Marshall (John Goodman) who force the ""Special Peoples Club""--sorry ""Wolf Pack""--to undertake a quest for Leslie Chow (Dr. Ken Jeong) who has stolen 21 million in gold bars.The ensuing crime plot involves an elaborate housebreaking Mexican jail some dead dogs some dead chickens base-jumping over Las Vegas and a lot of punching down at lower-status characters. Its a violent film and the leads though amiably antisocial arent murderers. The psychopathic Chow becomes a kind of storytelling force majeure descending from the sky to kill inconvenient antagonists so Cooper Galifianakis and Helms wont get non-giraffe blood on their hands.The momentum of the Hangover films lies in forcibly upending the status quo sending the pieces flying and then restoring it exactly. The ""Best Friends Gang""--sorry ""Wolf Pack""--plunges into life-and-death situations involving gangsters and duffel bags full of bullion but like sitcom characters emerge unchanged. Its the definition of a reactionary worldview that Judge Smails would approve of. Sure Alan meets a girl (the awesome Melissa McCarthy who has a cumulative four minutes of screen time) but they only connect because they have exactly the same personality reflecting and affirming their mutual callowness.The anxious Stu (Ed Helms) who lost a tooth and awoke with a facial tattoo in the previous films here goes unmaimed. Stus redemptive moment in the first film was standing up to his cartoonishly mean-spirited girlfriend; now he struggles with the professional insecurity that doctors are more admired than dentists a conflict that is not riveting. While sparing Stu from scarring injuries and relationships avoids repeating the jokes of the earlier Hangovers it robs this film of the single character who ever had a chance of growing.In his stand-up work Galifianakis is less ingenuous than Alan but both the comedian and the character obliviously violate social norms. Hes never funnier than when hes bluntly asserting absurdities as obvious facts. In all three films Alan is both the storys means of status-quo-upheaval and the ultimate source of its restoration encapsulated by a ""nothing changes"" speech at the conclusion. His naivete continually thwarts the groups strategies and activates new plot threads and the cluelessness of his cruelty to other people at least is intentionally grounded in the characters privileged and overprotected background.What Warner Brothers marketing is now calling the ""Wolf Pack Trilogy"" is funny but unlovable asking the audience not just to laugh at all this meanness but actively to identify with it. Theres nothing in the films world to contradict the self-satisfaction of its characters and even the bad guy honors the ""Wolf Pack""s dumbass name.At its best antisocial comedy is society-affirming because it capitalizes on a shared sense of social norms and the outrageousness of violating them. It wouldnt be possible to laugh at Judge Smails if you didnt sense his solipsism and selfishness. Youre being asked to laugh at him not with him. By contrast the Hangover franchise positions spoiled douchebags as admirable and cool visually aggrandized with slow-motion hero walks like Gemini astronauts in The Right Stuff. Phillips is zero percent interested in exploring the narcissism of his characters as long as they arrive back exactly at the point of departure. So he killed a giraffe. Who gives a fuck?

Success breeds sequels or in the case of The Hangover II the exact same movie reset in Bangkok. This third - and if there is a benevolent god last - entry finds our unholy trinity returning to the original scene of the crimeVegas. Wolf Packers Phil (Bradley Cooper) Stu (Ed Helms) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) are on the road again when theyre kidnapped by John Goodmans mob boss; it seems Mr Chow (Ken Jeong cringeworthy as ever) has stolen some gold bricks and only the trio can find him.Youd think that a Vegas reprise might channel some of the first films gonzo energy but other than an early giggle-inducing shocker (two words giraffe decapitation) Part III has curiously little interest in being even remotely funny. Instead director Todd Phillips inexplicably aims at making a standard action movie complete with car chases and break-ins that compound the sense of creative bankruptcy. Galifianakiss clueless manchild act feels pitifully DOA while Cooper and Helms having realised they could play their roles in their sleep proceed to do just that. Its only in an end-credits coda that the envelope-pushing of the series is displayed. That you have to wallow through 100 minutes of Hollywood dry-heaving to get there is the sort of fuck-you to the fans youd rather forget.

However though the film never really reaches the heights of the first film. Goodman is good Chow is amusing but annoying and Alan is still the lost and annoying man child you would find amusing for a couple of hours but would want to kill within 2 days. A week after watching Fast 6 in a virtually full screening there were only half a dozen watching this at the same time on a Saturday PM. Time to call a halt to a story that has run its course.

Five minutes into ""The Hangover Part III"" a giraffe is gruesomely decapitated by a freeway overpass. While this unfortunate event is ultimately tangential to the films plot it nonetheless marks its best shot at leaving a lasting legacy with the phrase ""beheading the giraffe"" perhaps someday supplanting ""jumping the shark"" as the cliche of choice to mark a franchises official descent into pitiable pointlessness. Nearly bereft of laughs this final ""Hangover"" should nonetheless generate lucrative business due to simple brand recognition and a desire to see the old gang one last time as they dutifully distractedly wind down the clock. Once the highest-grossing R-rated comedy ever made the first ""Hangover"" was one of the best surprises of 2009; a thoroughly modern callback to the great politically incorrect bro comedies of the 1980s enlivened with a novel narrative twist. A 2011 sequel reeked of laziness reprising the originals every beat with mechanical obligation yet it still managed to squeeze out some quality gags. ""Part III"" however takes the opposite path to even worse results. Ditching the hangovers the backward structure the fleshed-out characters and any sense of debauchery or fun this installment instead just thrusts its long-suffering protagonists into a rote chase narrative periodically pausing to trot out fan favorites for a curtain call. SEE ALSO Warner Bros. Unveils New Man of Steel Poster At times its debatable whether ""The Hangover Part III"" should even be considered a comedy at all as it more often plays like a loopily plotted exposition-heavy actioner. Despite a career-long devotion to low-brow comedy director Todd Phillips displays a deft touch for the various jail breaks heists and car chase sequences that arise here while the films attempts at basic comic banter wither on the vine. One wonders how he would fare directing a straight genre project in which he could use dark humor to spice up the action beats rather than the other way around. But as for the film at hand it focuses on goonish outcast Alan (Zach Galifianakis) then kicks into gear as he accidentally jumps the ... or rather beheads a giraffe and sparks a subsequent highway pileup the aftermath of which causes the death of a minor character. One of the more subtle subversions of the whole ""Hangover"" trilogy is its notion that any real-life person who embodied the old ""wild and crazy guy"" comic archetype would actually be a terrifying psychopath and that theme reaches its logical conclusion here as the assembled returning characters stage an intervention. Wolfpackers Phil (Bradley Cooper) Stu (Ed Helms) and Doug (Justin Bartha) convince Alan to check into a psychiatric treatment facility in Arizona by promising to drive him there themselves. No sooner have they reached the desert than theyre run off the road by a gang of pig-masked thugs commanded by crime boss Marshall (John Goodman). For reasons too confusing and irrelevant to relate the Wolfpacks first Las Vegas bacchanal four years ago somehow allowed the effeminate Chinese gangster Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) to steal a truckload of Marshalls gold bricks. Taking Doug hostage Marshall gives the remaining trio three days to find both Chow (sprung from a Thai prison in the pics prologue) and the purloined gold entailing a journey to Tijuana and then back to Vegas. That the plot is convoluted and ridiculous isnt really a problem but by playing things completely chronologically -- and worse soberly -- this films shenanigans feel witlessly arbitrary in a way that the previous installments avoided. Another key failing is the films centerstage placement of characters who work best on the fringes like Alan and (especially) Chow. As unhinged as they were both earlier ""Hangover"" films managed to keep the focus on Cooper and Helms whose characters bore at least passing resemblance to actual adults while Galifianakis and Jeong brought in desultory rushes of cartoonish anarchy. Reverse those proportions however and the proceedings become unpalatably frenzied akin to being served a full plate of wasabi with a sushi garnish. Having recently proved he can tackle roles of far greater sophistication Cooper seems the most disengaged among the cast and several of his disdainfully delivered lines cant help but feel like meta-commentary on the whole affair -- ""who gives a fuck?"" and ""what the fuck are we watching?"" in particular. Goodman brings surprisingly little to his heavy role although fellow newcomer Melissa McCarthy playing a deliciously vile Vegas pawn-shop owner steals the one scene here that could be spliced into the original film without a loss in quality. Tech credits are topnotch throughout with special plaudits going to lenser Lawrence Sher and second-unit d.p. Josh Bleibtreu for crafting some genuinely elegant compositions where lesser work probably would have sufficed. Elaborate old-school aerial stunt work shot over Las Vegas Boulevard and on a (convincing) replica of the Caesars Palace facade leaves a strong impression.

Frank Caruso says May 21 2013 at 944 am Why are all movies that have sequels shot for at least three Where is all this creativity? Not at major studios thats for sure. Thank God there are a fair amount of independent films out there especially on DVD or download. Major Theater chains support these studio films and they deserve each other. Reply George Valentin says May 21 2013 at 358 am I am looking forward to seeing this movie on May 23. Reply SeinfeldFan180 says May 20 2013 at 1042 pm Okay all I got from this review is that Zach and Ken spend most of the movie doing crazy shit Melissa McCarthy plays a ""deliciously vile Vegas pawn-shop owner"" in one hilarious scene and the cinematography and stunts are awesome. If that doesnt describe a comedy Ill eat my hat. Seriously who goes to a ""Hangover"" movie to watch Bradley Cooper act like a mature adult? Ive always wanted more Mr. Chow and Zach cant not be hilarious. So this review doesnt deter me one bit. Im also definitely looking forward to seeing the role of jade reprized by the gorgeous and comedically brilliant Heather Graham whom this review has failed to even mention. Reply Tye-Grr says May 20 2013 at 1142 pm Thats because Heather Graham fails to be more than an unfunny cameo in the film. Thats it. You dont have to take my word for it- go read the other reviews and youll see that what they all have in common is that they say that this film is much darker than the first two and much less funny. Oh and anyone who wants more of Ken Jeong has my deepest sympathies. He has to be one of the most annoying and unfunny people on this planet.
