Oh if only that meant - yep this is what weve been reduced to - ""Bad Boys III. Instead we get ""Big Mommas Like Father Like Son with Lawrence pulling his prosthetic bazoombas tablecloth dresses and bad wig out of mothballs for another case as FBI agent-in-drag Malcolm Turner. And this time Malcolm has a gal pal of sorts his all-grown-up stepson Trent (Brandon T. Jackson ""Lottery Ticket) a cross-dressing vision of homeliness in his own right.Not that the two dont have their issues (besides the whole tranny thing that is). Malcolm proudly dreams of sending his kid off to college at Duke but Trent defiantly pushes his own plan to hit the concert circuit as a rapper. Without Trents mom around to mediate -- Nia Long has been written out here for anyone keeping track -- the spat spills over into Malcolms workday. When Trent foolishly lands himself square in the sights of a Russian baddie (Tony Curran) that Malcolm is after dad and son are forced into hiding.The pair are MacGuffined off to a girls high school for the arts where Malcolms Big Momma alter ego conveniently fills a dorm mother vacancy and Trents kneesocks-sporting ""Charmaine salivates at the pajama-party prospects. Then Trent falls for good-girl hottie Haley (Jessica Lucas ""Melrose Place) blows his cover and sets the gangsters back on his trail. All of which is beside the point of course -- were here to see Big Momma get roped into modeling for a life drawing class one of the few gags that sort of works here.The listless comedy isnt helped any by punchless sparring between Momma and an attitudinal ballerina (Portia Doubleday ""Youth in Revolt) she cant help lecturing. ""Big Mommas is going to sermonize about body image? Really? Director Patrick Whitesell (""Big Mommas House 2) also tries to change up the tone with a ""Fame-style musical number here and there but the best the movie manages is a Disney Channel-ing duet between Jackson and Lucass characters.Looking back its strange to remember that the first two movies were both hits and that Paul Giamatti and Terrence Howard even saw enough in the premise to sign up for the original.

"Big Mommas All in the family drag | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesBig Mommas All in the family dragReview of Big Mommas Like Father Like Son by entertainment reporter Bruce DeMara.Martin Lawrence right is undercover and under much makeup once more now with Brandon T. Jackson in Big Mommas Like Father Like Son.By Bruce DeMaraEntertainment ReporterMon. Feb. 21 2011 Big Mommas Like Father Like Son (out of 4) Starring Martin Lawrence Brandon T. Jackson. Directed by John Whitesell. 107 minutes at major theatres. PG In a future time as an alien civilization begins to pore through the shattered ruins of our defunct civilization to determine the causes of our ruination the multi-disciplinary effort will doubtlessly include a team of social anthropologists whose job will be to study the vestiges of our doomed collective culture. This team of extraterrestrial deep-thinkers will inevitably come across African-American comic/actor Martin Lawrence and his body work in film including the latest Big Mommas Like Father Like Son. One preliminary conclusion they are likely to draw is the pervasiveness in black American culture of the archetypal Earth Mother -- or in the lingua franca of this sub-culture Big Momma -- a figure revered for both her tough love and tenderness her wise but salty tongue her ability to work tirelessly to feed her family keep a roof over their heads and to tend their various physical and emotional needs. The more discerning among them will quickly understand how wretchedly exploited this benevolent figurehead has been throughout this comedy franchise most particularly in its third installment. Here FBI agent Malcolm is on the trail of a Russian mobster named Chirkoff -- a reference which will cause the E.T. scholars a moment of puzzlement to decipher its purported humour value -- and most particularly for a flash drive containing incriminating evidence hidden somewhere in an Atlanta girls school for the arts. Unfortunately his son Trent has witnessed a murder by said mobster and before you can say Flip Wilson as Geraldine Jones Malcolm is back in fat drag as the schools newest den mother with his/her awkwardly homely grand-niece Charmaine in tow. The ease with which the two are able to assume these new identities the speed with which they are able to change in and out of costume -- reminiscent of a quick glide down the Bat-pole -- and the voluminous quality of the wardrobe which emerges from the two small carpet bags they bring along as luggage will cause some initial consternation to our cadre of outer space intellectuals until they become better acquainted with the human concept of suspension of disbelief. A quick reference to Gilligans Island may assist especially on the third point. Cultural slang references will surely be noted and duly deciphered i.e. ""Ambush him (Malcolm) at his grind"" Trents friend proposes ""grind"" in this case referring to his step-fathers job site. ""Im feeling you"" Trent replies which means ""I understand"" or ""Good idea."" An assessment of the film as part of a dissertational examination of Lawrences contribution to comedic posterity and to African-American cultural history will surely note that the film was not pre-screened for critics in advance and that despite its highly negative reception by the entertainment critic-erati that it still achieved a sizeable economic return for its producers. And with this report concluded this far-off race of beings will be another small step closer to the answer they are seeking.

Share Tweet Note carefully the title of the third Big Momma movie. Theres no house and no numeral giving the chilling implication that the series will no longer be restrained by space and can potentially spin off into infinity adding momma after momma with each new entry. Only the subtitle will change Big Mommas The Search For Big Mommas Gold Big Mommas Mommas To Moscow Big Mommas In Space etc. etc. Or maybe not. Star Martin Lawrence now the sole remaining element from the original Big Mommas House 11 years ago looks pretty tired both in and out of makeup here bringing only a fraction of the purse-slapping fat-jiggling energy on display when the series began. He isnt the only worn-out element of the film which opens with him overseeing a botched attempt to catch some criminals by wiring one of their own. One dead informant later Lawrence and stepson Brandon T. Jackson are both donning dresses and going undercover at an all-girls art school in search of an incriminating flash drive. Thats a ridiculous excuse to get the leads in drag but to be fair its no more ridiculous than any other plot in the Big Momma series. And again being fair the slackness of the gags that follow--which include an impromptu cafeteria-moving rap sequence and a flesh-pressing game of Twister played by Lawrence and an unbilled Faizon Love--are also perfectly in keeping with whats come before. But it all seems so much more perfunctory. Playing a high-school senior but looking every one of his 26 years Jackson doesnt have the chops to compensate for Lawrences obvious disengagement. Lawrences grotesque fat-granny act wasnt funny the first time around but at least he was trying. Theres no punch to his flailing and chastising anymore and with Jackson failing to rise to the occasion theres no one to take the torch from his exhausted fat-suited hand. Even Big Momma deserves better than this. Share Tweet Filed Under Film More Movie Review Previous Movie Review Unknown Next Movie Review Of Gods And Men Dont miss a story--follow The A.V.

Jackson and Martin Lawrence in ""Big Mommas Like Father Like Son."" Credit John P. Johnson/20th Century Fox Since new school versus old school is one of the plot-generators (as opposed to ideas) floating around in the amiable schlocky family comedy ""Big Mommas Like Father Like Son"" it seems fair to point out that of all the cross-dressing comedies of recent decades none has channeled ""Some Like It Hot"" quite so thoroughly.Martin Lawrence plays Big Momma his F.B.I.-agent-in-drag character for the third time now with the addition of a rapping stepson (Brandon T. Jackson). Some narrative nonsense involving a murder and an F.B.I. mole sets the scene for both Mr. Lawrence and Mr. Jackson to don fat suits fake breasts and plus-size womens clothes and hide out in a girls performing-arts high school just as Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon insinuated themselves into an all-girls band in ""Some Like It Hot.""John Whitesell whose television directing credits stretch back to ""Roseanne"" and ""Coach"" blends the films various ingredients -- Billy Wilder ""Fame"" TV mystery shows -- into a smooth pap and milks the occasional contrived laugh from the sexual and generational setups. About the only honestly funny thing in the movie is Faizon Loves uncredited performance in the Joe E. Brown role as the school maintenance man whos immediately smitten with Big Momma. His ""not again"" isnt quite the equal of Browns ""nobodys perfect"" but it still gets the movies biggest laugh.BIG MOMMASLike Father Like SonOpened on Friday nationwide.

"Movie review Big Mommas Like Father Like Son - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review Big Mommas Like Father Like SonThis unfunny underdeveloped and slapped-together sequel stars Martin Lawrence in drag a again.February 19 2011|By Mark Olsen Special to the Los Angeles Times Brandon T. Jackson as ""Charmaine"" and Martin Lawrence as ""Big... (20th Century Fox )There are likely numerous reasons for the creation of ""Big Mommas Like Father Like Son"" a film so drained of entertainment or simple humanity it is difficult to relate to as anything other than industrial artifact. First and foremost the two previous installments in the comedy series a featuring Martin Lawrence as an FBI agent who finds himself in situations that demand he wear a latex fat suit with a highly detailed facial prosthetic to imitate an elderly woman a combined made hundreds of millions of dollars worldwide. Since the release of ""Big Mommas House"" in 2000 there also has been the rise of the wildly successful Tyler Perry films and his own granny-drag character of Madea which presumably caused Lawrence at some point to think ""Hey I do that too."" Additionally Lawrence might have possibly been motivated by a desire to reclaim the crazy that has more recently been usurped by actor and comedian Tracy Morgan whose Tracy Jordan character on the sitcom ""30 Rock"" seems partly based on Lawrence. What ""Big Mommas"" needs most of all is in fact a healthy dose of crazy some energy some sense that the people who created it cared in the least about the poor saps who might have to sit through the thing. The film is perfunctory and programmatic from its very start with a bluntly efficient montage of Atlanta locations. From there the setup is quickly established that Lawrence and his teenage stepson (Brandon T. Jackson) must go into hiding dressed as women at an upscale all-girls boarding school. The bad guys are vaguely foreign possibly Eastern European with wobbly accents that dont always match the way they look. The plot engine is something about a missing flash drive with incriminating evidence. (Thats as specific as it gets.) After Lawrences stepson witnesses a murder the villains set their sights on the youngster. And like that with a single cut to the pair on an escalator in slow-motion Lawrence and Jackson are in their drag costumes with no further explanation. (Is that the first step of FBI protocol?) Lawrence though it is never mentioned presumably had his costume from the previous films sitting in a closet somewhere. Jackson however must have been fitted for a full-face prosthetic mask and padded suit in a scene elided from the film. An audience is left to imagine on their own the hilarious getting-ready montage that might have been. The film is credited to director John Whitesell and writers Matt Fogel and Don Rhymer but it could easily have been created by some sort of auto-pilot algorithm. ""Big Mommas Like Father Like Son"" is a lifeless piece of pure product slapped together with haphazard disregard for comedy storytelling and filmmaking. It is a movie in a very broad sense of the term. Beyond that there is nothing much else to say. calendarlatimes.com Big Mommas Like Father Like Son MPAA rating PG-13 for some sexual humor and brief violence Running time 1 hour 48 minutes Playing In general release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESMovie review My Afternoons With MargueritteSeptember 16 2011Movie review The Other WomanFebruary 4 2011Capsule movie reviews Alien GirlDecember 17 2010MOVIE REVIEW  Especially on Sunday a Satisfying Trio of...August 13 1993MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesFilmEntertainmentStepsonCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-big-mommas-20110219,0,2771022.story",200,bigmommaslikefatherlikeson4,bigmommaslikefatherlikeson,latimes

Jackson and Martin Lawrence co-star in Big Mommas Like Father Like Son. (Twentieth Century Fo) Elizabeth Weitzman Friday February 18 2011 516 PM Title Big Mommas Like Father Like Son An FBI agent and his son go undercover as women. With Martin Lawrence Brandon T. Jackson. Director John Whitesell (147). PG-13 sexual humor violence. At area theaters.The most disturbing image in ""Big Mommas Like Father Like Son"" isnt the vision of Martin Lawrences 300-pound granny in the nude. Its the sight of Brandon T. Jackson following in Lawrences high-heeled footsteps. When Lawrence first attracted attention (""Do the Right Thing"" ""House Party"") he was a mischievous motormouthed prankster you couldnt stop watching. Right now youd be doing him a favor by looking away. Though Jackson (""Tropic Thunder"" ""Lottery Ticket"") has been working for a decade he still has a promising career ahead of him. So why is he cashing the easiest paycheck to come his way? Surprisingly the two have no chemistry as father and son though this may be because the 27-year-old Jackson is absurdly miscast as high school senior Trent. But realism is hardly a priority here so the plot kicks off when Trent and Malcolm (Lawrence) an FBI agent begin bickering about post-graduation plans. An aspiring rapper Trent is offered a tour the very day his Duke admissions letter arrives. In an effort to convince his dad to forget about college Trent shows up at a surveillance site witnesses a murder and has to go into hiding until an incriminating flash drive can be found. The drive has been stashed at an Atlanta boarding school for girls so Malcolm pulls out his dusty Big Momma costume (this is the franchises third and presumably final installment). Trent enrolls in the school as Charmaine befriending the other girls while secretly falling for gorgeous Haley (Jessica Lucas). With Big Momma ensconced as the new house mother all kinds of hijinks ensue. Oh wait--no they dont because first-time screenwriter Matthew Fogel runs out of ideas immediately. So all we get is an endless montage of Momma playing twister with Faizon Loves security guard while the worlds dumbest villains make enough mistakes to extend the running time to a torturous 107 minutes. Whether hes playing Charmaine or her smooth ""cousin"" Trent Jackson looks uncomfortable enough to suggest he feels our pain while Lawrences brief early flashes of humor disappear entirely once he dons the fat suit. It definitely doesnt help that the movie is preceded by a preview for ""Madeas Big Happy Family""; if Tyler Perry finds liberation in lipstick Lawrence has become suffocated by Spanx. When his nemesis calls him a ""master of disguise"" in solemn admiration its the only truly funny moment in the entire movie.

Its all an openly lame excuse for Lawrence to hop back into the eye-assaulting muumuus of his alter ego Big Momma a wheezing overripe hybrid of a Southern dumb-belle and a Julia Child drag impersonator. The trouble is once the movie drops its cop-drama trappings it doesnt do any better as a comedy. Lawrences gender-bending jokes are played out and his slapstick is wooden and slow. Its understandable Clowning around underneath that fat suit must be exhausting. Almost as much as watching it.

But maybe it should have been. Attempting to double down on the one-joke premise that profitably propelled two earlier franchise entries ""Big Mommas Like Father Like Son"" is kind of a drag when it resorts to frantic slapstick and tired action-comedy tropes but modestly engaging during stretches that suggest the project would have worked better as an exuberant musical. With Martin Lawrence back as the femme-disguised FBI agent he played in ""Big Mommas House"" (2000) and ""Big Mommas House 2"" (2006) the new sequel should be able to trade on its brand-name appeal for fair-to-middling theatrical B.O. and homevid biz. Once again Lawrences brash Malcolm Turner dons improbably efficient prosthetics and an amply padded fat suit to disguise himself as Big Momma a kinda-sorta soul sister of Tyler Perrys Madea. For ""Big Mommas"" Malcolm creatively cross-dresses to go undercover as a housemother at the Georgia Girls School of the Arts where an informant hid a flash drive containing evidence incriminating a Russian mobster (Tony Curran) before being inconveniently killed. Complicating the caper Trent (Brandon T. Jackson) Malcolms rebellious 17-year-old stepson must join his stepdad on campus and pass himself off as Charmaine Big Mommas grand-niece having witnessed the murder of the aforementioned informant. Director John Whitesell (who helmed ""Big Mommas House 2"") and scripter Matthew Fogel dutifully recycle comic shtick from the previous pics. Predictably Trent/Charmaine must struggle to maintain his cool and his disguise around scantily clad femme students and actually falls for a young college-bound beauty (Jessica Lucas) whos set on earning a music scholarship. Meanwhile Malcolm/Big Momma tussles with a mean-girl ballet student (Portia Doubleday) and wards off advances from a lovestruck school security guard (an unbilled Faizon Love). Lawrence comes across as more strident than usual in pics early scenes as he impatiently rousts a mailman (a wasted Ken Jeong) to grab Trents college acceptance letter then condescendingly dismisses his stepsons desire to become a free-styling rapper instead of a freshman at Duke. Indeed the actors trademark charisma doesnt begin to shine through until midway through ""Big Mommas"" Lawrence and Jackson share an unexpectedly sweet musical interlude as Malcolm and Trent riff on a classic Temptations tune. This duet and a handful of other scenes -- including an energetic cafeteria-set production number that plays like a ""Fame"" outtake -- likely will make some auds wish the filmmakers had taken even greater advantage of setting their plot in a high school for performing arts students. This is not quite ""Big Mommas House The Musical."" But maybe it should have been. In contrast theres little that is fresh and nothing at all inventive about scenes involving the brandishing and firing of guns the unfunny excesses of a putatively comical car chase and the repetitious sass and brass of Big Mommas life lessons. Jackson makes an appealing impression especially when Trent is able to doff his disguise to woo the charming Lucas. Standouts in the student body include Doubleday whose character isnt nearly as bitchy as she initially appears and Michelle Ang as an unlucky-in-love lovely who gets a crash course in self-respect. Makeup effects by Spectral Motion are almost too good; its more than a little distracting to note how easily Malcolm can hide his mustache with artfully applied prosthetics. Other tech values for this shot-in-Atlanta feature are more than adequate.

John Whitesells extraordinarily witless movie operates as a checklist for cultural and racial cliches Young black men prefer hip-hop dreams to college educations; foreigners are evil; fat people are hilarious; skinny white blondes are bitches; and girls (even artistically talented ones) secretly spend their free time staging lingerie dance parties. Amid these cruddy generalities lies a lame premise Fed Malcolm (Lawrence) and his 17-year-old wannabe-rapper son Trent (Brandon T. Jackson) go undercover as overweight women at an all-female Atlanta arts school in order to catch a Russian criminal (Tony Curran). Dutiful Bosom Buddies-style scenarios ensue with Malcolm being romantically pursued by a hefty security guard (Faizon Love) and Trent attempting to woo a beautiful pianist (Jessica Lucas)--though the narratives prime objective is milking nonexistent laughs from Lawrences latex-swaddled sassy-mammy routine. Fatally anorexic in terms of comedy action and romance Big Mommas depressingly corroborates Trents belief that ""theres no rush to greatness.""

TWITTER The threequel which stars Martin Lawrence and ""Tropic Thunders"" Brandon T. Jackson wont likely disappoint fans of men-in-drag comedy but doesnt offer much thatas original or funny. You get two Big Mommas for the price of one in Big Mommas Like Father Like Son where Martin Lawrences FBI agent forever undercover as a girth-challenged woman passes the torch -- no make that a fat suit and wig -- to a stepson who joins him in drag. This is not a case of doubling the fun so much as an anxious attempt to revive a franchise running out of gas. While not likely to increase the Big Momma audience the movie isnt likely to disappoint either if one is prone to love men-in-drag comedy which reaches back even before Milton Berle. The moral here is if you slap a dress on a guy they will come. So Fox should see decent critic-proof business for a couple of weeks. Not that Uncle Miltie didnt have better gags. For that matter so did Mrs. Doubtfire and Dame Edna Everage not to mention Josephine and Daphne in Some Like It Hot. But credit the Martin Lawrence movie series at least with this Hes a lot funnier than Tyler Perrys Medea. Now that woman is just scary. It no doubt would be much funnier to witness the story sessions where director John Whitesell who helmed the first sequel and screenwriter Matthew Fogel were confronted with the challenge of figuring out how to get the FBIs oddest agent into womens clothes for a third time. When Fogel got his B.A. in English from Yale and MFA from Columbia University do you suppose he had this in mind? In the end the story can endure no scrutiny because little makes sense beginning with an opening sequence where the FBI agent commits major felonies simply to get a letter from a postman about to deliver it anyway. The men these being Lawrences Malcolm Turner and comedian-actor Brandon T. Jackson as his stepson Trent come to an Atlanta-area girls school as a house mother and her beefy young niece to hide out from three criminals even as they search for the computer flash drive that will put these three stooges behind bars forever. This sets up a series of gag situations where the schools hulking security guard develops a crush on Turners Big Momma while Charmaine Trents nom de femme develops a warm womanly friendship with a beauteous singer-songwriter Haley (Jessica Lucas). Other gags stem from classes in ballet art and the like where Big Momma and Charmaine labor to maintain their poses. The positive side to this third Big Momma film concerns less what it does do then what it doesnt do. The film doesnt go overboard with bad-taste jokes like the previous two. The absence of toilet humor feels like an actual blessing. Nor does the movie turn Jackson who had a solid turn as a rapper in Tropic Thunder into a Big Momma clone. Hes his own woman so to speak. In other words the movie couldve been worse. But Like Father Like Son doesnt do anything very original or very funny either. The flatness of some gags is downright astonishing. The lack of real menace from the criminals or real energy in the search for a missing flash drive or real relationships among the girls in the school is breathtaking. Is this all Big Mommas brain trust could come up with in the four years since the last film? Technical credits are middling. Theres nothing to be ashamed of here but neither is this title going high on anyones filmography.
