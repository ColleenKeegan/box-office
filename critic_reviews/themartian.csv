By Anthony Lane Matt Damon is stranded on Mars in a new movie directed by Ridley Scott.   Credit Illustration by Tomer Hanuka Poor Matt Damon. Nobody wants to be friends with him. Last year in ""Interstellar"" he played an astronaut named Mann who was sent through a wormhole and ended up alone on a frozen planet. This year in ""The Martian"" he plays an astronaut named Mark Watney who is marooned in a pelting storm and left behind alone on the red planet. The difference is that Mann was cunning and resentful prepared to cause havoc in his desperation to escape whereas Watney is cunning and resourceful--not a blamer or a soul in meltdown but a model of cockiness and grit as he sets about the business of survival. Watney is part of Ares III a NASA mission to Mars captained by the phlegmatic Lewis (Jessica Chastain) who floats around her ship like a zero-gravity mermaid. The rest of the crew comprises Martinez (Michael Pena) Johanssen (Kate Mara) Vogel (Aksel Hennie) and Beck (Sebastian Stan). Having landed on the planet and settled into base camp they last eighteen days before the storm blows in and forces them to abort blasting off at a perilous angle. Watney is abandoned presumed dead. All this happens fast at the outset of the movie--so fast indeed that its the only section that feels rushed. We scarcely have a chance to get our bearings before they are thrown out of whack and we see very little of Watney before he wakes up in the desert on a nice bright Martian day with a length of broken radar antenna sticking out of his gut. No matter. From here on we have all the time in the world. And he has four years to kill on his world before anyone can swing by to pick him up. But how do you dramatize a waiting game? Given the threat of tedium and the stony desolation of the backdrop some viewers will be bracing themselves for Beckett in space with the added twist that Godot could burn up on reentry. Do not fret. The director is Ridley Scott who as if taking a cue from his hero rejoices in the challenge of solitude. He cuts between the cameras mounted inside the base which show Watney toiling away (plus in a worrying side panel the pressure temperature and oxygen levels). There is also a video diary to which Watney confides his schemes and ruminations all of which scorn the existential in favor of the pragmatic. He is the mission botanist ideally placed to raise crops with which to feed himself. ""Mars will come to fear my botany powers"" he declares before gathering the dried excrement of his colleagues. Plug your nostrils add soil sow seeds hang around and--hey presto--potatoes. If there is water on Mars nobody told Watney so he has to brew his own. In short when he announced early in his predicament ""Im going to have to science the shit out of this"" he wasnt kidding. Ridley Scott is seventy-seven years old yet the startling fact is that ""The Martian"" appears to be the work of a young man. When Watney having made contact with Earth states that he is ""really looking forward to not dying"" he speaks for the whole production which thrums with an appetite for life. It cant get enough of the right stuff. There are plenty of scenes back at NASA where the bigwigs--played by good-humored actors like Jeff Daniels Chiwetel Ejiofor and Kristen Wiig--struggle to keep up with Watneys progress and where even a simple press conference is framed and edited to keep the tone sprightly and deft. Much of Scotts output in the past decade from ""Kingdom of Heaven"" (2005) to ""Exodus Gods and Kings"" (2014) resounded with a heavy tread whereas the new film based on a novel by Andy Weir is so light on its feet that anybody listening at the door of the theatre might think that there was a comedy playing inside. Again and again chances for portentousness arise and get batted aside. When the folks on Ares III still journeying home learn that their friend is alive and that lines of communication are open Martinez sends him an e-mail ""Sorry we left you on Mars but we just dont like you."" He knows that Watney will get a kick out of that and behind the joshing is the unspoken promise that come what may the crew will move heaven and earth to get him back. It is thirty-six years since Scott made ""Alien"" and the true companion piece to that great film is not ""Prometheus""--the gloomy beautiful and oddly superfluous prequel that he directed in 2012--but ""The Martian."" Sigourney Weaver and Matt Damon are cut from similar cloth. True the first is faced by a beast with acid for blood while the second solemnly reveals that ""it has been seven days since I ran out of ketchup"" but both are loners by force of circumstance and copers by instinct. In a recent interview Scott described ""Robinson Crusoe"" as ""one of my favorite books as a kid"" and its hero as ""the first astronaut"" and the new film tunes in to that old fixation. So does its leading man. Damon has never seemed more at home than he does here millions of miles adrift. Would any other actor have shouldered the weight of the role with such diligent grace? He is our most unstarry star no longer needing to hunt for our good will. Someone like Tom Cruise is too acutely conscious of his image to convince as a regular Joe and Christian Bale too remote whereas Damon like Crusoe feels stranded on our behalf tasked with digging up the best of himself. Hence the first grainy picture of Watney that is patched through to NASA; he may be Lazarus come from the dead but he poses in his spacesuit thumbs way up as the Fonz. Terrible place Mars. Happy days. If you think Mark Watney is in a tight spot look at Jafar Panahi. He is the Iranian director whose works include ""The White Balloon"" (1995) ""The Circle"" (2000) and ""Offside"" (2006). With every film three things have occurred he has strengthened his reputation as a wry and dexterous humanist; he has urged us to listen to those Iranians especially women and children whose voices might not otherwise be heard; and his overlords have grown ever more convinced that this guy is a pain in the neck. The crunch came in 2010 when Panahi was sentenced to six years imprisonment on a charge of creating propaganda against the regime and banned from making movies for twenty years. Since then he has occupied himself with projects designed to exasperate his foes. One result was a film with the Magrittean title of ""This Is Not a Film"" (2011) which was reportedly smuggled out on a flash drive concealed in a cake. If only all releases could be handled in so thrilling a fashion. Imagine if the new James Bond movie could arrive inside a chocolate eclair. Panahis latest exercise in outwitting is ""Taxi"" in which he plays himself. He spends almost the entire film behind the wheel of a cab which he drives around Tehran. Its never quite clear if he has slid under the radar of the authorities or if they consider life in a car to be a kind of mobile incarceration which at least will keep him out of mischief. Nice try fellows. His conversations are filmed by a dashboard camera which he occasionally swivels around to inspect the road ahead or to record the activity of his passengers one or two at a time. ""Whats that?"" he is asked. ""An anti-theft device?"" ""Sort of"" Panahi replies and hes right. Simply by catching these lives on the fly he offers a fresh rebuke to the embezzlement of his free speech. The people in his taxi are a mixed bunch. Are they actors or passersby plucked from the streets? We dont know and there are no end credits but the mystery is sweet. We get a loudmouth who discussing thieves announces ""If I were head of state Id hang a couple of them just to shake them up"" then adds that hes a mugger by trade. Theres a victim of an accident his head wet with blood who gets ferried to hospital; a couple of elderly ladies bearing an open goldfish bowl sloshing with water as if lent to Panahi by the ghost of Mack Sennett; and a man named Omid--stumpy and sweaty delivering foreign DVDs around town like drugs. (""I brought you The Walking Dead Season Five."") Then comes Panahis niece Hana a chatterbox of ten or eleven and Arash an acquaintance from his neighborhood. Finally we meet ""the flower lady"" as Hana calls her a human-rights lawyer en route to a client in jail. She lays a red rose next to the windshield as if by the headstone of a grave. The urge to film is never far away. The wounded man dictates his last will and testament into Panahis iPhone; Arash has CCTV footage on his iPad showing him being mugged which he wants to share with Panahi; and as for Hana she has to shoot a short movie for school under risible restrictions. (For good characters pupils must ""use the sacred names of Islamic saints."") All this could have yielded something clammy and cloistered just as Panahis status as a martyr for his art could have gulled him into loftiness and pride; and yet by some miracle ""Taxi"" stays as modest as his smile the point being not to recruit us to his cause but to put us on the side of his compatriots. The mocking of oppression may be steely but the films an easy ride.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

To wit ""Im gonna have to science the (expletive) out of this."" Said when ill fortune leaves him stranded and alone on Mars with only his wits and his knowledge of well you know to keep him alive until a rescue can be mounted. As a botanist and an engineer Watney is well-equipped with the brain power needed to overcome the many obstacles director Ridley Scott and screenwriter Drew Goddard strew in his path on the Red Planet. The fact that hes kind of a wise guy as well makes him a very relatable hero. Damon is perfectly cast to play the smart-alecky Everyman which is how hes presented in the Andy Weir best-seller on which the movie is based. Daunted when a freak sandstorm injures him and forces his crewmates to blast off from the planet believing hes been killed he quickly blows past despair and goes into ""lets work the problem"" mode. That quote is one of the most memorable utterances in ""Apollo 13"" a movie that ""The Martian"" with its NASA-centric story and its all-hands-to-the-pumps cooperation-is-key vibe resembles more than just a little. Back on Earth the world with NASA leading the charge is gung-ho to help plucky persistent Watney and bring him back alive. There are no villains here no dark forces conspiring against the good guys. And that makes it a most atypical Ridley Scott project. The last thing youd expect from the maker of ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"" and ""Prometheus"" is an unfailingly positive story like this. Its pretty sunny and often funny a space oddity for a director not known for pictures with a sense of humor. Quite a bit of the humor arises from the incorporation of disco tunes into the story an element directly lifted from Weirs book. Alone on Mars the only music Watney has to listen to are disco hits left behind by his departed commander played by Jessica Chastain. Donna Summers ""Hot Stuff"" and Gloria Gaynors ""I Will Survive"" are employed to great effect underscoring and commenting on the action. Oh and duct tape? Used to make lifesaving fixes in critical busted components. Funny. Soren Andersen asoren7575yahoo.com Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights delivered weekday mornings.

Handling the elements of his signature style with a flair he hasnt shown since Gladiator (2000) Ridley Scott returns to mainstream mastery with The Martian a space misadventure turned survivors tale. Similarities to Apollo 13 and the more recent Gravity will be obvious to anyone whos ever rocketed into zero-g thrills but thats not to say that Scott--who does well by Andy Weirs science-heavy 2011 novel (smartly streamlined by scripter Drew Goddard)--doesnt bring his own spin. A scary storm on Mars swarms the Ares 3 crew in a blizzard of frozen dust reminiscent of the inhospitable planet from Alien (1979). After an emergency evacuation strands Matt Damons presumed-dead astronaut Mark Watney on his own his initial wandering of the vacant ""hab"" outpost plays like any number of Scotts moody sci-fi classics from Blade Runner to Prometheus. But differently The Martian has spunk in store ""Im not going to die here"" Watney says in his video diary and we actually hear a heavy-metal power chord as this chatterbox of a botanist gets to work manufacturing water from hydrogen creating a greenhouse-enclosed potato farm (fertilized by the disappeared crews waste packets) and cooking up a way to contact Mission Control. Bringing optimism nerd-itude and a touch of crazy to his characters solo ordeal--at one point scraggly Watney calls himself a ""space pirate""--Damon is the key to the movies exuberance. This is his Cast Away and its hard to imagine another star commanding the role with such boyish brainy confidence. The rest of the film though about Watneys rescue suffers slightly in comparison. Sometimes it plays rivetingly via Jeff Danielss NASA administrator eyeballing the bottom line and weighing the costs of a public-relations disaster; sometimes it plays in a discordant Armageddon-ish comic register as when klutzy astrophysicist Donald Glover slips on his spilled coffee. (As for the distracting presence of Kristen Wiig lets just say her role is brief enough to be a skit on SNL.) But mainly The Martian strikes an invigorating note of lets-work-the-problem cool bringing in the Chinese space program for a utopian assist and saluting a little insubordination as Jessica Chastains guilt-ridden orbiting commander decides to go rogue in an explosive finale. A movie about intellect triumphing over fear loneliness and an all-disco playlist (the only tunes Watney is left with by his departing cohorts) it gets the mind racing.

Although there were some similarities along the lines of the ""stranded in space"" theme Matt Damon was the difference. For a serious movie Damon provided quite a bit of comic relief with some well-timed self deprecating humor. At times it was a bit too playful back on earth but overall it worked well.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreFeb 29 2016Peter YtastemakerFeaturedThe Martian is less a space movie than a movie about the powers of hope and unwavering belief. After an initial accident Matt Damon is left barely alive and stranded in Mars (surprise). With only his previous knowledge and scientific theories Matt has to fend for himself and survive before a rescue effort can be mounted. While the film succeeds in painting a grandiose image of space it really shines in showcasing human emotions when one is faced with an almost insurmountable task. Due to the films length there invariably will be some moments that dragged on for a bit too long. However timely comic relief from Damon really helps the pacing and makes the film that much more enjoyable. Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreFeb 22 2016CarrollsfeettastemakerFeaturedEffortlessly watchable The Martian transports you to the red planet Mars on a rescue mission to retrieve the stranded astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon).Damons comic relief counterbalances the direness of his situation where he is challenged to grow enough potatoes to survive and MacGyver a communication system with mission control.Despite Damons entertaining ingenuity ""Houston we have a problem"".  In characteristic Ridley Scott form The Martian has a strong first half but lags with sluggish technicalities in the second half.The Martian also missteps with several other space movie stereotypes like ""Space Films that are Way Too Long"" (see Contact and Interstellar) and ""Astronauts that are Implausibly Good-Looking"" (see George Clooney in Gravity and Sam Worthington in Avatar).  Add to this the difficulty of suspending disbelief as split-second calculations and astrophysical feats become increasingly farfetched.Flaws aside the technical execution is so impressive that you forget what youre watching is mostly CGI.  In the end it is worth checking out now that it is available on DVD/steaming.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreFeb 10 2016Lindsey WTastemakerFeaturedI really like space movies sci-fi movies anything a little out of this world so I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I had previously heard that the book was a little slow paces and inner dialogue heavy so I was skeptical as to how this would translate to the screen but it did a great job of keeping my attention. It was actually quite funny at time (for such a depressing subject).

I feel like I never felt the true gravity of his situation (""gravity"" ha-ha) due to how often humor was used I guess I had just expected it to be a bit more serious than it ended up.

After an emergency departures from Mars that left Matt Damon behind NASA eventually discovers that he is still alive.  The problem was that it took 4 years to reach Mars and his food supply was not sufficient enough to last.  Thankfully Damon is a botanist and figures out how to grow veggies on Mars to survive.

On other occasions its the result of extraordinary collaboration. The Martian is one of these latter cases. Yes Matt Damon is awfully good. But Matt Damon is always awfully good. Yes director Ridley Scott has a terrific eye for the material. But he had a terrific eye in Prometheus as well and that didnt save it from being an utter mess. Yes Drew Goddards screenplay is a sharp nimble adaptation of the novel by Andrew Weir. But ... you get the idea. Related Story Will Living on Mars Drive Us Crazy? The Martian succeeds because everyone involved does his or her job and does it superbly. There are no tedious backstories no leaps of rampant illogic no poorly cast performances no tacked-on romantic subplots no extended narrative lulls. The film is a profound testament to the rare--and underrated--virtue of simply not screwing anything up.The story is a simple one. On a manned mission to Mars the crew of the transplanetary vessel Hermes is surprised by a sudden violent sandstorm that forces them to evacuate their landing site. In the midst of their frenetic escape one crewmember appears to have been killed and they leave him behind. But the crewmember is not actually dead and he wakes to find himself abandoned and alone in the airless inhospitable waste of the Red Planet. So that crewmember Mark Watney (Damon) begins the slow arduous chore of not allowing himself to die.Hes the ships botanist which helps as he feeds himself in part with potatoes he grows and fertilizes with his own shit the circle of life compressed all the way down to a single individual. Its almost two months before NASA notices changes at the landing site via satellite photo--wasnt the rover on the other side of the habitat in the last picture?--and realizes that Watney is alive. Its another couple of months before NASA decides to tell his old crewmates sailing through the void back to Earth that they left him stranded.Not that there isnt plenty for Watney to do during this time. In addition to the potatoes there are the problems of water (""the good news is that I know the recipe"" Watney tells the recording camera that is the closest thing he has to a companion) of heat (never has a deteriorating plutonium core come in handier) and of finding a way to communicate with Earth. These tasks Watney undertakes with ingenuity and (mostly) good cheer. As he will explain the process later ""You do the math. You solve one problem. And then you solve another. And then another. Solve enough and you stay alive.""And though Watney may be alone hes no longer abandoned. Back on Earth NASA employees (played by Chiwetel Ejiofor Jeff Daniels Kristen Wiig Sean Bean Benedict Wong Mackenzie Davis and Donald Glover) are scrambling frantically to come up with a feasible rescue plan. So too are his former shipmates (Jessica Chastain Michael Pena Kate Mara Sebastian Stan and Aksel Hennie). Indeed one of the most refreshing elements of The Martian is that it has no villain no foil--apart from the inconceivable hardships of Mars of course. Theres no craven crewmember on the Hermes whod rather leave Watney behind no penny-pinching bureaucrat back on Earth who says theres not enough money for a rescue mission.There are disagreements--some of them substantial--about the best course of action. But every character in the film is fully committed often at substantial personal cost to the goal of getting Watney home safe. (Even one of the United Statess global competitors offers its help.) This unanimity of purpose imbues the film with a rare generosity of spirit. The term ""uplifting"" might be appropriate here had it not fallen on such hard times.The film is a profound testament to the rare--and underrated--virtue of simply not screwing anything up.How good is The Martian? Well its good enough that I didnt begrudge it the appropriation of Bowies ""Starman"" which in a lesser film would be an act of criminal coyness. Indeed despite its intermittent calamities and constant life-or-death tension The Martian has a degree of humor uncharacteristic of a Scott film including a running gag about the awfulness of the disco tracks that were left behind with Watney. (""Hot Stuff"" ""Rock the Boat"" and ""Love Train"" all make appearances. Even under the circumstances however ""Waterloo"" remains a bridge too far.) But perhaps the movies best joke involves the love for J.R.R. Tolkien that is apparently encoded into the DNA of every living male nerd.Damon is as noted excellent--but then so is literally every member of the supporting cast. To call out any in particular would be an injustice to those left unmentioned. In this the collaborators who put together the film--Scott Goddard the cinematographer Dariusz Wolski the entire cast and on down the list--resemble the NASA folks and Hermes crewmembers of the movie itself They are all pulling together toward the same goal and doing so with extraordinary skill and tenacity. The result is to an uncommon degree a complete success.

But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

After Khizr Khan spoke politicians and commentators on most networks said they were moved humbled inspired choked up. (Commentators on Fox did not say these things because their coverage cut away from the Khans for Brit Hume and Megyn Kelly plus a Benghazi ad.)

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip.

Its directed by science fiction legend Ridley Scott. By Peter Rainer Film critic October 2 2015 Save for later Saved Mark Watney (Matt Damon) tries to engineer his own deep-space survival in The Martian. Aidan Monaghan/20th Century Fox/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of When I first heard that Ridley Scott would be directing the movie adaption of Andy Weirs science fiction novel ""The Martian"" starring Matt Damon as a NASA botanist stranded on Mars after a sandstorm forces his crewmates to abort the mission I assumed we were in for another outer space gorefest a la ""Alien."" Instead what we have is almost jocular - a semiserious survivalist jaunt studded with wisecracks. In some ways this is a relief. After intergalactic thudders like Christopher Nolans ""Interstellar"" that black hole of ponderosity I was more than willing to sit back and enjoy a no-frills space adventure without all that metaphysical hoo-ha. For much of the way Scotts 3-D movie which takes place over two years and was written by Drew Goddard plays like a nuts-and-bolts manual for how to stay alive Robinson Crusoe-style on Mars. Damons Mark Watney left for dead after being impaled by a communications antenna some 18 ""sols"" (Martian days) into the mission manages to subsist on the Red Planet through sheer force of cunning. Even though as a botanist he was the least tech savvy of his crewmates (played by among others Jessica Chastain and Michael Pena) his skills prove indispensable in isolation. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time He recycles his own waste to fertilize potatoes burns rocket fuel to create water and in general manages to create enough sustenance to theoretically last him until the next planned mission nearly four years away - that is until the inevitable disasters (Martian frost chemical explosions) upend his plans. Eventually after much NASA haggling a round-trip rescue mission is engineered by his earthbound crewmates who were late in learning of his survival and guilt-ridden at having left him behind. The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide Marks survivalist spunk is so upbeat its almost creepy (though not intentionally so). He jokes to himself in homemade videos and ruefully notes that his only source of entertainment are the disco hits and ""Happy Days"" tapes left behind by his crew. While he occasionally mentions in passing that his chances of staying alive are slim for the most part hes sunny and upbeat. (Had he already read through the script?) He takes perverse pride in the fact that on this planet whatever he does or wherever he goes ""Im the first.""  Entertaining as the movie often is this all-American can-do attitude is also the source of its shortcomings. Given the enormousness of its subject there is a radical lack of awe in this movie. Norman Mailer once groused about Apollo 14 astronaut Alan Shepards hitting a golf ball on the moon as if the act was insufficiently respectful for such a transcendent enterprise. I kind of agree. The same problem exists in ""The Martian"" which is also transcendence-challenged. The film showcases Mark as a spunky jokester conveniently without even a family back home to pine over. Hes a gumption machine. (The films anthem Im sorry to say is Gloria Gaynors ""I Will Survive."")Although the film is pretty good at being scientifically sound without boring us its optimistic agenda goes awfully easy on the actual conditions on Mars. In a recent New York Times op-ed titled ""Lets Not Move to Mars"" writer Ed Regis pooh-poohing futuristic talk about colonization of the planet calls Mars ""a veritable hell for living things were it not for the fact that the planets average surface temperature is minus 81 degrees Fahrenheit."" Obviously he didnt figure on Mark and his fertilized potatoes.The question of just how transcendent sci-fi movies should be is a tricky one. I thought ""Gravity"" not nearly as scientifically sound as ""The Martian"" was just fine as long as the astronauts were loop-the-looping in broad arcs through silent space. Its when George Clooney and Sandra Bullock opened their mouths and out popped Hollywoodspeak that matters came crashing earthward. Sci-fi movies that try to be trance-outs like Stanley Kubricks ""2001"" or Andrei Tarkovskys ""Solaris"" are at the opposite end of the sci-fi movie spectrum from ""The Martian."" They get the awe part all right but just as often they up the snooze factor. On Pinterest? Explore the stars and planets follow the Monitors Astronomy board Perhaps the best mix for me was Steven Spielbergs ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" which at least fit my temperament for this sort of thing It was extravagantly funny but also awestruck with wonderment about the great beyond. Scott for all his visual panache has never been a depth-diver. His movies even the most effective of them - ""Blade Runner"" the most harrowing New World dystopia on film - are all on the surface. ""The Martian"" plays to both Scotts strengths and weaknesses. By relegating Marks predicament to a purely survivalist scenario he keeps things humming along without ever widening the horizon. But there was an obligation to widen the horizon. I didnt come out of this movie humbled awed frightened or transported. Scott is hitting golf balls in the galaxy.

"The Light Stuff Ridley Scotts Fun Remote The Martian << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com The Light Stuff Ridley Scotts Fun Remote The Martian 20th Century Fox Movies October 2 2015 by Alex Pappademas Facebook Twitter Print At times The Martian feels like Ridley Scotts apology to anyone still annoyed by the degree to which Prometheus hinged on ostensibly brilliant scientists making fatally dumb-ass choices. Its a brisk funny piece of competence-porn sci-fi about a stranded astronaut (Matt Damon) who totally keeps his shit together -- and uses it to fertilize a DIY potato crop on a planet where no food grows. The story adapted by Drew Goddard from Andy Weirs 2011 novel is basically Robinson Crusoe (or 1964s Robinson Crusoe on Mars). But the specific brand of ingenuity it celebrates feels thoroughly 21st century. Damons Mark Watney is (luckily enough) a botanist and (even more luckily) an upbeat get-er-done maker-nerd who masters the harsh Martian landscape by approaching each obstacle as a matter of lifehacks or death. He even vlogs the whole experience into a GoPro; I kept waiting for him to 3-D-print a carbon-fiber wallet or stop and talk into the camera for 20 minutes about why you should always add turmeric to your Bulletproof coffee. You may remember Stranded Astronaut Matt Damon from such films as Interstellar but the similarities are only superficial. Christopher Nolans film was a cerebral puzzle box with ""Cats in the Cradle"" heartbreak at its core -- astrophysics notwithstanding it was a fable about a man who goes off to work and comes home to find his children all grown up. The Martian doesnt treat space as a metaphor. Its not a vast and forbidding Kubrickian void where puny humans tremble in the face of the incomprehensible. Its not even a crucible where characters must confront their tragic Earthly backstories in order to carry on the way Sandra Bullock does in Gravity. Space is just a problem to be solved by groups of smart adults armed with duct tape and plastic sheeting and scale models and binders full of ASCII code and dry-erase boards. Once hes performed some fairly gruesome autosurgery on injuries sustained in the accident that causes his crewmates to leave him for dead the next thing Watney does is sweep their left-behind personal effects into plastic storage bins as if homesickness is a waste of calories. Level heads prevail both on Mars and back on Earth where the news of Watneys survival launches a rescue effort led by a cavalcade of stars. 20th Century Fox Damon Jessica Chastain Sebastian Stan Kate Mara and Aksel Hennie in The Martian. Special-effects categories notwithstanding you couldnt quite call this an Oscar-bait movie but casting-wise it sure looks like the Oscars or at least the Golden Globes. Jeff Daniels plays the director of NASA mediating the occasionally divergent priorities of a team that includes Chiwetel Ejiofor Kristen Wiig and Sean Bean (plus the great Mackenzie Davis from AMCs Halt and Catch Fire ably holding her own in intimidating company). Jessica Chastain Michael Pena Kate Mara and Sebastian Stan play Damons erstwhile Mars-mission crewmates who sport comfy shawl-collar astro-sweaters and Lululemonish NASA hoodies and float around a spaceship furnished like a hip architecture firm. At NASAs Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena the movie picks up Donald Glover (channeling both Troy and Abed as a possibly on-the-spectrum hipster astrophysicist) and Prometheuss Benedict Wong whose performance as the Jet Propulsion Labs long-suffering boss comes out as one long deadpan sigh. Even the Chinese space-program bigwig who appears in a couple of brief scenes is played by a star the popular Hong Kong character actor Eddy Ko. His subplot in which American ingenuity gets a much-needed assist from Chinese good sportsmanship feels like a nod to the foreign-market realities that shape movies made at the 100 million price point. The China scenes are in keeping with the movies cheerful worldview. Goddard has described the movie as ""very much a love letter to NASA"" and a story in this weeks Hollywood Reporter detailed the productions ""unusually close relationship"" to the space agency from the lengthy phone chats Sir Ridley had with a NASA scientist known as ""Dr. Mars"" to a September preview screening aboard the International Space Station. When asked if the timing of this weeks announcement regarding liquid water on the Red Planet was NASA doing the production a viral-marketing solid Goddard told Indiewire ""We should be so lucky."" And in return for NASA helping make this movie look real Scott amp; Co. have made NASA look good. Even when the plot requires Daniels to balk at a particularly risky Hail Mary solution the script takes care to distinguish his caution from cowardice by having him remind Bean that ""Every time we lose one the world forgets why we fly."" Ironically though the film goes about restoring our faith in space exploration by glossing over any connection between this government agency and the actual government -- apart from a passing reminder that Chastains crew is part military -- and instead ascribing to it the virtues we associate with bold private-sector companies. This is a nimble rule-bending virtually red-tapeless space program ever ready to pivot to the next great outside-the-box idea -- a dot-gov that behaves like a dot-com with Damon as the ultimate corporate self-starter doing more with less. Watney curses Mars and his bosses and gripes repeatedly about Chastains Commander Lewis leaving behind an iTunes library full of nothing but cheeseball disco hits and when he runs out of traditional condiments he seasons his potatoes with crumbled Vicodin. But we never see him shed a tear curse his God or otherwise appear to be seriously entertaining the notion that Mars (or ""Turn the Beat Around"") can break him. He does convey some instructions about what to tell his parents if he doesnt make it but it plays like one more to-do list item being crossed off. Its hard to create a sense of jeopardy around a movie star in a scenario like this -- hard but not impossible. A classic Robinsonade like Cast Away works whether or not you believe for a second that Robert Zemeckis will kill Tom Hanks because whats actually in danger is the self Hanks brought with him to the island. You can be sure even on first watch that a rescues coming but you worry there wont be anything left of that guy when they get there. In The Martian Watney never loses his ability to find the humor in his predicament and if this eminently enjoyable movie has a flaw its that his unfailingly even keel -- and Damons careful avoidance of anything remotely histrionic -- robs his logistical struggles of any real psychological dimension. The barrenness of the planet never really gets to him which keeps it from quite getting to us. Filed Under Movies The Martian Matt Damon Ridley Scott Alex Pappademas is a staff writer for Grantland.

Photo Aidan Monaghan/ Twentieth Century Fox Sci-fi fans might feel a frisson at the end of The Martian when the credit aDirected by Ridley Scotta fades in over a shot of space. It evokes the same credit over a shot of space in Scottas 1979 sci-fi classic Alien a a cold cynical icky film still a prime specimen of the subgenre known as abody horror.a The Martian is so not that. It flips Alien on its polar axis In this space everyone can hear you scream. The whole world in fact is watching and rooting for space botanist Mark Watney (Matt Damon) left for dead on the red planet and now tasked with keeping himself from starving before NASA can send fresh vittles and/or bring him home. Mark is an amazingly resourceful guy but the film still says it takes a village. And I couldnat help thinking as I watched Iam part of that village Itas like wanting to clap for Tinkerbell. Cynical as I am about how monster-budget blockbusters have come to dominate the studio mind-set I canat imagine anyone not liking this one. The Martian is shot designed computer-generated and scripted on a level that makes most films of its ilk look slipshod. Scott and writer Drew Goddard arenat trying to make an aimportanta sci-fi movie like Interstellar. They aim lower but blow past their marks. Related Stories The Martian and The Intern Are Movies About Nice People. We Need More Like Them. The movie is even more ingratiating than Andy Weiras best-selling novel a guileless un-crafty piece of storytelling that holds you anyway because its writer is so absorbed in How Things Work on a lifeless planet that you canat wait to see Mark solve the next unsolvable problem. Weir is the son of a particle physicist and an electrical engineer and he immersed himself in the mechanics of space travel. Even NASA folks who found Gravity scientifically ridiculous sat up and saluted him. (Fun fact Heas afraid to fly.) The film has the advantage of filling out the thin characters with charismatic A-list actors and Damon gives a confident movie-star performance He uses his great comic timing to crack wise while also managing to suggest hes really frigging scared. The Martian opens with the catastrophe that strands him storm comes mission gets aborted Mark gets slammed by debris and vanishes into the maelstrom and his commander (Jessica Chastain) searches desperately until the last possible second before getting her team the hell off the planet. The effects are awesome. The astronauts stagger through the storm -- fuzzed out by swirling soil -- in an image that evokes Mario Bavas ominously beautiful Planet of the Vampires (a source of inspiration for Alien) and when the storm passes the 3-D brings out every ripple of Marss mountainous terrain. You might think youre watching a travelogue. For a while no one knows that Mark survived but The Martian doesnt unfold in silence even when hes all by his lonesome. He keeps a video diary. He frets jokes and trash-talks the red planet. (""Mars will come to fear my botany powers"") He literally shovels shit to help grow potatoes. He does self-surgery -- always good for a wince and a laugh. He soberly calculates his odds. (""Eventually Im gonna run out of food. So yeah. [pause] Yeah.) Its an emotionally irresistible moment when a few ""sols"" (Martian days) later a young NASA monitor (Mackenzie Davis) sees evidence that Mark is alive and alerts mission director Chiwetel Ejiofor who alerts NASA PR director Kristen Wiig who alerts NASA head Jeff Daniels -- who alerts the world. Suddenly everyone in The Martian is problem-solving including Donald Glover as a zany science student who comes up with an outlandish plan when all seems lost. Even our archrivals the Chinese get into the act. It takes a global village. Plus a lot of good actors. Sean Bean is around doing something important and zooming toward Earth are Michael PeA+-a Kate Mara Sebastian Stan and Mark Vogel. None of their characters know that Mark is still alive because Danielsas NASA director doesnat want to burden them with that knowledge. I think theyad be happier to know his body wasnat back there ossifying. Whatever. The real reason of course is that The Martian needs an authority figure whose authority every character gets to flout a to applause and cheers. Even so at the end of the sol heas a nice guy. Are there terrific roles for all these terrific actors? By blockbuster genre standards theyare okay but no character has more than one or two traits. Itas nice to see Wiig in astraighta roles a it would be nicer if she werenat so self-effacing. Chastainas commander is supposed to be an a80s disco nut (a running gag is that Mark has nothing else to listen to on Mars) but there isnat much disco in her performance. (Sheas still fun to watch though a thatas one face that holds the camera.) Daniels does an amusing job as the administrator forced to calculate more variables than Watney does and Ejiofor classes up anything heas in. I trust they were all well-paid. These are not empty calories. As Star Trek has inspired generations of astronauts astrophysicists and insufferable Comic-Communists so might The Martian move kids to study science math and even botany. Do you think Im pie-in-the-skying this? This is the movies banner line after Mark bumps up against an unusually formidable obstacle ""Im going to have to science the shit outta this."" The rollicking climax suggests that by working together humans can bend space to their will. The movie turns Alien into Friends.

"Martian The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; martian-the ) Martian The (United States 2015) October 02 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli The Martian is the latest in a series of realistic science fiction films - movies that eschew the space opera elements of the genre and concentrate instead on believable aspects. Following in the wake of Christopher Nolans Interstellar (and featuring two of the same cast members) The Martian speculates about how a near-future manned Mars mission might evolve. With the exception of a slightly over-the-top ending the film mostly avoids the ""Hollywood-isms"" that sometimes degrade science fiction into futuristic fantasy. This is neither an action-oriented motion picture nor a special effects extravaganza. Its an introspective story about what it might be like to be the sole inhabitant of a distant world and knowing that instant communication isnt possible and a rescue is at best a year away. Its also an examination of how necessity truly can be the mother of invention - not only for the survivor but for those on Earth seeking to find a way to save him. The events of The Martian transpire in the near future although an exact date isnt given. As the movie opens the six-person crew of the Ares 3 mission are on the planets surface conducting experiments and gathering samples. In addition to astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) and mission Captain Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) the crew includes pilot Rick Martinez (Michael Pena) chemist Alex Vogel (Aksel Hennie) and specialists Beth Johanssen (Kate Mara) and Chris Beck (Sebastian Stan). The approach of a major storm - one that has the potential of tearing apart the fragile artificial habitat - forces Lewis to order an emergency evacuation. In the race to the escape craft Watney is struck by a piece of flying debris lost and presumed dead. He is reluctantly left behind by his fellows. When NASA receives the news director Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) and Mars mission controller Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) make the news of the death public. Watney isnt dead however. Although injured he is able to use an emergency medical kit to close a wound and after coming to terms with the enormity of his situation he assesses what he will have to do to survive. Within a month NASA has become aware of his survival and not long after rudimentary communications are possible. The film then becomes a race against time to save Watney before his provisions run out. Most movies about Mars (and there have been a lot of them) are hybrid science fiction-horror or science fiction-thriller productions with little emphasis on the ""science fiction"" part of the equation. Since The Martian isnt interested in the exploitation aspect that makes it an outlier in the ""Mars"" canon. Instead its a close cousin to sci-fi stories like Moon Gravity and Interstellar and deals with some of the same themes and ideas as Cast Away and Touching the Void. The Martians drama evolves from showing how the character copes with isolation. There are certainly physical challenges but the psychological difficulties are the most compelling ones. Although the concept of a modern day Robinson Crusoe marooned on Mars might sound like a depressing proposition the films tone never ventures into dark and downbeat territory. Without detracting from the seriousness of the situation director Ridley Scott infuses the production with moments of low-key appropriate comedy. Watneys introspective video journals illustrate not only his practicality and innovation but his wry (sometimes gallows) sense of humor. Likewise some of the Earth-based scenes while not openly comedic are played with a lighthearted sensibility. For Matt Damon this is a rare opportunity to show his range. Neither action hero nor supporting character nor George Clooney sidekick he gives a performance to rival The Departed as the best of his career.  One key difference here he isnt surrounded by the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio Jack Nicholson and Martin Sheen. This is Damons movie and its hard to find a flaw in the way he brings Watney to life. The fear the anguish the loneliness the desperation and the joy... theyre all there. Only once does Watney give into despair and on that occasion it doesnt last long. The secondary cast is impressive with names like Jessica Chastain Kristin Wiig Chiwetel Ejiofor and Sean Bean lending their talents but their roles arent large. They support and never threaten to take the spotlight away from Damon. (Considering that he also played a stranded astronaut in Interstellar one wonders whether he has become Hollywoods go-to guy for this kind of character.) As a director Ridley Scott is by no means a ""cant miss"" proposition.  Although one can rarely fault his ambition the results have been mixed especially in recent years. When it comes to science fiction however Scotts track record is solid Alien Blade Runner Prometheus - two bona fide classics and one flawed but compelling odyssey. The Martian is a different kind of film from those but no less impressive. Scott uses special effects as a tool to enhance the experience rather than as the means to define it. Many of the effects in The Martian are of the practical variety with CGI used primarily to add an otherworldly flavor to the Martian landscape. The space sequences are nearly as good as those in Gravity. The 3D although not as impressive as in Alfonso Cuarons 2013 picture feels neither gimmicky nor unnecessary. As uneven a director as Scott can be he can do some amazing things when hes ""on""; this is one such occasion. The Martian is based on Andy Weirs novel of the same name and uses a similar science-based approach to many of its scenes. NASA was involved both at the script stage and during filming and although there are instances in which The Martian takes liberties with the laws of physics it presents one of the most accurate screen depictions of space travel to date. This authenticity is one of the factors that attracted Damon and Scott to the project and Weirs continued involvement brought NASA on board. In releasing The Martian 20th Century Fox has fired the first shot in the 2015 Oscar competition. Although the science fiction genre is more often associated with the escapist fare of summer than the serious offerings of the fall The Martian is an exception. Those who crave nonstop action and seizure-promoting editing may find this films pace too deliberate. They may be unable to appreciate its character focus and slow but undeniable build-up of tension. This is science fiction for sophisticated audiences and as such a fulfilling and satisfying experience.

Barry Hertz The Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 02 2015 1200AM EDT Last updated Wednesday Oct. 07 2015 1221PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Ridley Scott Written by Drew Goddard Starring Matt Damon Chiwetel Ejiofor and Jessica Chastain Genre scifi Country USA Language English On Monday NASA surprised the world by announcing it had found water on Mars. To the jaded and conspiracy-minded - who are drawn to stories about the space agency like flies to the lights of Capricorn One - the reveal seemed less like a bit of great news in the annals of science and more a dastardly Hollywood marketing trick to promote Fridays release of The Martian. But Ridley Scotts sci-fi drama doesnt need any PR stunts Its pure blockbuster cinema expertly engineered to appeal to the widest audience possible. Mere word of mouth not secretive schemes will ensure its box-office success. Of course the movie is also the best advertisement NASA could ever hope for. Unlike recent films that portray space travel as a terrifying ordeal (Interstellar Gravity Scotts own Prometheus) The Martian makes the outer limits and the scientists who explore them not only fun but smart sexy and cool. Hell Im scared of simply sleeping outdoors and I walked out of the movie with just the tiniest daydream of strapping myself into a rocket and shooting for the stars (ideally with Matt Damon as my co-pilot).Most radically though its not brawn or quips or deus ex machinas that save the day in The Martian its simple intelligence and ingenuity. Theres a central hero here sure but the film is not meant to celebrate the efforts of one man. Instead the saviour of the day is science. I doubt a single blockbuster over the past decade could say the same thing.Credit for this wild diversion from the status quo chiefly goes to Andy Weir and Drew Goddard. The formers self-published novel is not only an expertly written thriller but a love letter to the stirring heights of the human brain. (After selling 35000 e-book copies in three months Crown Publishing purchased the rights for a proper hardcover version.) In the wrong hands a big-budget adaptation could have turned Weirs witty and technically sound prose into plodding sci-fi gobbledegook. Thankfully Goddard (The Cabin in the Woods Cloverfield) is one of the smartest screenwriters working today and instead smoothed Weirs words into a tightly crafted ode to creativity.The story starts in the near-future where a manned mission to Mars is quickly abandoned because of a massive storm. In the chaos astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon who can be very charming when not mansplaining things in the press) is struck by flying debris and presumed dead. His comrades leave the red planet for their long journey back to Earth; yet Watney wakes up just a few hours later injured alone with few supplies and virtually no way of contacting home.Instead of giving up though Watney starts racking his intimidating brain to in his words ""science the shit"" out of his situation. Soon enough hes communicating with a gang of equally resourceful geniuses back home (played by a murderers row of character actors including Chiwetel Ejiofor Jeff Daniels Sean Bean and Kristen Wiig) growing potatoes hot-wiring land rovers and generally humiliating anyone who ever majored in English.Its one thing to bask in the glories of science though and another to make it so much damn fun. And here is where Scott with a huge assist from Goddard shines. With expert pacing sharp dialogue that never dumbs things down and a cheeky disco soundtrack (yes) The Martian is nearly all things to all audiences a ticking-clock drama an intimate character study a sci-fi comedy a rollicking space adventure. Its almost impossible to dislike which is perhaps its only flaw. When a huge film reveals its eager-to-please intentions from the get-go the stakes evaporate awfully quick.Still that shouldnt discount the immediate pleasures of The Martian nor its hopefully endearing after-effects. If everyone can get excited about an improbable NASA-Hollywood-Mars water conspiracy surely we can also embrace a film that only wants to highlight our better smarter selves.

Forget existential dread the fifth dimension and anything else Christopher Nolan explored in the drab ""Interstellar""; ""The Martian"" is a rollicking outer space adventure with a classic rock and disco-fueled soundtrack and a good old-fashioned movie star turn from good old-fashioned movie star Matt Damon.Its no brain-dead exercise in moronism. ""The Martian"" packs a surprising amount of science into its script (by Drew Goddard adapted from Andy Weirs book) but always makes it palatable to the audience. Character A says ridiculously complicated thing involving mathematics trajectories and actual rocket science; character B explains what was said in terms those of us who dont have Ph.Ds in astronomy can understand. It makes science accessible and botany cool no small feat for a trip to the multiplex where brain cells go to get obliterated.Damon is astronaut Mark Watney who early in the film gets left behind when a mission to Mars goes bad. From there its up to his fellow astronauts (including Jessica Chastain Michael Pena and Kate Mara) the NASA team on the ground (Jeff Daniels heads up the crew which includes Kristen Wiig and Chiwetel Ejiofor) and several control rooms full of people who burst into applause to bring him home to safety. (If there was a Super Bowl for movies with scenes of large groups of people bursting into applause ""The Martian"" would win it.)Damon carries much of the film himself in stretches where hes alone on screen and he beams charisma in a radiant confident performance. Hes not Tom Hanks in ""Cast Away""; hes surrounded by technology and devises ways to communicate with his command center back home. He feeds himself learning to farm inside his space station by using human waste to grow potatoes. (The real disaster occurs when he runs out of ketchup.) And he keeps himself sane by filming video diaries and listening to pop music. The films use of ABBAs ""Waterloo"" may have been director Ridley Scotts sly wink to his rumored knowledge of the presence of water on Mars far ahead of this weeks surprise announcement.Scott whose recent track record is spotty at best (""The Counselor"" and ""Exodus Gods and Kings"" -- anyone?) is firing on all cylinders here. (He tends to do well in outer space. See ""Alien"") However he stays at the party too long. One of the great pluses of Alfonso Cuarons ""Gravity"" for example was the way he wrapped things up in a taut 90 minutes but Scott cant resist stretching ""The Martian"" out well past the two-hour mark. Theres one big action set piece too many one more disco joke than was needed. Its not a deal breaker but it does dull its impact and Scott should have known better when it was time to come down to Earth.Still as far as a good time is concerned he brings it home.

Either way Mars is calling Andrew OHehir Follow Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Extraterrestrial Life on Mars life on other planets and moons Mars matt damon Movies NASA Our Picks Our Picks Movies Outer Space ridley scott science fiction Science Fiction and Fantasy space program the martian Entertainment News News (Credit Twentieth Century Fox) I believe it was the film historian Mark Harris (also the undisputed heavyweight champion of Oscar bloggers) who first injected a note of cynicism into the furor surrounding one of the biggest scientific discoveries of the 21st century Flowing water on the surface of Mars. Was it entirely a coincidence Harris tweeted that the very same week was also bringing us Ridley Scott and Matt Damons science-nerd extravaganza ""The Martian"" the most pro-NASA movie in many years? Which is by the way a tremendously exciting popcorn spectacle and also a portrait of extraplanetary survival convincing enough that it had my tech-obsessed 11-year-old companion on his feet cheering on several occasions.Im pretty sure Harris was kidding and did not think that NASAs big announcement was a movie tie-in. But I also dont think Matt Damon actually meant to say that he thought gay actors should stay in the closet which was how a clumsy statement he made in a Guardian interview has been interpreted. But before we move on from the briefly titillating question of whether we will find unexpected life on another planet within our lifetimes to the far more important issue of Celebrities Who Say Dumb Things (which often feels like the central theme of the Internet after amusing cat videos) - wait hang on lets not move on dammit.Lets go to Mars. If this weeks unlikely coincidence of life and art is sending us a message from God or our alien overlords or the marketing geniuses of Hollywood thats what it is. I think we have to go to Mars. If your first reaction is to say we cant afford it or theres too much screwed-up stuff to deal with here on Earth - well sure. But thats not the way the human species has ever approached things and I believe that on some fundamental level its neither the right answer nor a true answer.Launching a new manned spaceflight program alongside the current unmanned research missions that have immensely expanded our understanding of our planetary neighbors and the universe does not mean giving up on addressing climate change or developing alternative energy technology or reducing poverty and inequality. It might over the long haul make those things easier to deal with rather than more difficult. Science and technological possibility and human ambition are not zero-sum equations; one of the dorky but inarguable points made over and over again in Drew Goddards screenplay for ""The Martian"" (which is adapted from Andy Weirs bestselling novel) is that ambition breeds innovation and innovation spurs on ambition.Yes it will cost fabulous almost unimaginable sums to develop and execute a human Mars mission like the one that goes awry in ""The Martian."" If anyone were to propose a concrete number -- 100 billion has repeatedly been floated but given the history of the space program that is almost certainly a lowball estimate - the inner Grover Norquist within all of us would rise up and vow to drown this pointless scheme in the cosmic bathtub. But thats small-minded thinking from a nation that has grown distressingly hunched and small. In 1962 John F. Kennedy made that famous speech at Rice University announcing that the United States would put a man on the Moon before the end of that decade -- and it happened. In 2004 George W. Bush announced a plan to send humans back to the Moon by 2020 and establish a long-term base there to be used as a launchpad for missions to Mars and elsewhere. Hows that been going?Among the innumerable signs of Americas imperial decline few are clearer than our abandonment of a manned space program and the governmental defunding of numerous scientific disciplines. We have collectively decided - or we have permitted it to be decided in our names which comes to the same thing - that science is not trustworthy and not worth it that wed rather cut taxes for millionaires and build up the national debt by pouring our grandchildrens dollars into the black hole of permanent war and an omniscient security state.Sure I can hear those murmurs of prudence and caution coming from the liberal quadrant too which has grown hunched and small in its own distinctive way. As I was about to wrap up this article I heard about Rush Limbaughs pronouncement that NASA was lying about the discovery of water on Mars in order to push a ""leftist agenda"" and I could just rest my case right there. To a certain disturbingly widespread mind-set scientific discovery and the advancement of human knowledge are suspicious in themselves and likely to produce culturally unhealthy outcomes. Look at the mess Galileo and Darwin got us into Of course the right knows or pretends that evolution is dubious and that schoolchildren should ""study the controversy."" How convinced are they really that this whole business about the Earth orbiting the sun - when common sense tells you otherwise -- is not the cover story for a ""leftist agenda""? You Might Also Like Anyway liberals - please dont start in about how we need that money to feed the hungry provide universal healthcare make higher education affordable and clean up the environment. Im in favor of those things too but were not doing them anyway and we wont until we have a more realistic taxation structure in this country and can break free of the ideological hypnosis of austerity and privatization and ""market-based solutions."" (Which was inflicted upon us by Bill Clintons administration and the Democratic leadership caste of the 90s at least as much as by Reagan and the Republicans.)If we dont have single-payer health insurance and a way to send every qualified kid to college and a realistic plan to land a woman on Mars by 2027 its not because we lack the resources. Its because our minds have been clouded by lies and manufactured delusions and because our priorities are hopelessly screwed up. Lets assume that 100 billion estimate for a Mars mission is low way low. Lets assume its too low by a factor of 10 and that sending human beings to the Red Planet and getting them back in one piece would cost more like 1 trillion. Unimaginable right? Yeah its a lot - so much that its almost one-fourth the estimated total cost of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Which were super-necessary and did so much for humanity that we cant possibly imagine having done without them.As for ""The Martian"" if its a feature-length advertisement for the possibilities of a new human spaceflight program its a damn fine one. If the sheer number of low-tech solutions stranded astronaut Mark Watney (Damon) must improvise in order to stay alive indefinitely on Mars -- after being left behind alone badly injured and with little food or water -- beggars the imagination each individual stroke of genius is plausible enough. Back on Earth we have perhaps my favorite dork-moment in the movie (there are dozens of those if not scores) when a young telemetry genius at NASA unveils his outrageous breaking-all-the-rules plan to rescue Watney after more conventional methods have failed. His codename for the scheme is Project Elrond and everybody in the room begins exclaiming about how thats the perfect monicker for a secret meeting where a radical shift in strategy is decided upon while the NASA P.R. official played by Kristen Wiig looks on in bewilderment announcing ""I hate you all so much."" This is Ridley Scotts most entertaining and energetic film in a very long time and made me want to forget ""Prometheus"" all over again (having pretty well forgotten it once already). You can argue that the plot of ""The Martian"" doesnt offer many surprises but this is a movie of innumerable delightful moments and small discoveries and even more of infectious enthusiasm. Goddards screenplay captures and distills the tirelessly geeky behind-the-scenes camaraderie of this massive technical exercise and also the dedication and momentum that keeps pushing Damons character forward even when he is 99 percent sure he will die alone millions of miles from home.In casting the large and delightful multiracial and mixed-gender ensemble of ""The Martian"" which includes Jessica Chastain as the Mars mission commander Michael Pena as a fellow astronaut Chiwetel Ejiofor as the head of Mission Control in Houston and Donald Glover as the telemetry wunderkind who may save the day Scott has done more than score identity-politics points. (Although I dont doubt that such a motivation was in the mix.) Hes announcing that the infectious nerdy enthusiasm this film celebrates and embraces - and indeed proposes as the true solution to what ails us embodied here by the reverse-Christ figure of one solitary dude trying to grow potatoes on a (presumably) lifeless planet - has spread far and wide and cannot be stopped.These days it isnt just bespectacled white boys (and Asian boys) who love physics and engineering and microbiology who worship technology on its own terms and also for the human possibilities it opens and who will take massive dorky enjoyment in being part of something called Project Elrond. Boys and girls and men and women of all colors and on all continents will thrill to this movie this week as they have thrilled to the news that the red orb out there in space which has teased us so long at the outer edges of human imagination and human possibility may not be barren after all. Can we afford to go to Mars? We cant afford not to. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Or crack jokes or take inventory or talk to a computer considering his chances for survival.Watney a botanist was abandoned on the Red Planet when his NASA crewmates beat a hasty retreat in the mighty whorl of a storm. He had gotten separated in the minutes before the emergency launch and when he was hit by debris and his suit stopped emitting signals he was presumed dead.Wrong.But it will take months for the resourceful scientist to figure out a way to let Mission Control know that hes alive and ticking and it will take years - years - for Houston to ready a mission to get up there and bring him home. Even if Watney rations out the packs of food in the kitchen of the ""Hab"" - the prefab habitat he and his Ares III buddies had shared - hes unlikely to live long enough to meet his rescuers.Whats a poor deserted astronaut to do?Adapted from Andy Weirs 2011 novel of the same name - a self-published success story if ever there was one - The Martian is never less than engaging and often much more than that. For at least half the film it is Damon alone rooting through his departed colleagues personal effects trekking across the otherworldly sands recording his thoughts for posterity and then in a display of Eagle Scout ingenuity harvesting crops - potatoes - in a place where nothing grows.""Mars will come to fear my botany powers"" Watney says in what we come to learn is his characteristic mode - deadpan defiant. Damon is terrific here balancing wiseguy levity with a sturdy resolve and glimmers of doubt and dread. There are moments when he realizes he could die - but he shakes them off soldiers on.Using Drew Goddards text-faithful screenplay an unwavering affirmation of science and scientific know-how Scott and his team (cinematographer Dariusz Wolski pointing the way) create an utterly credible near-future scenario. By the time the movie returns to Earth to catch up with NASA and its politics-and-PR sensitive director (Jeff Daniels) its administrators engineers and flight controllers (Kristen Wiig Sean Bean Chiwetel Ejiofor Mackenzie Davis) and their counterparts at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena the suspense is mounting mightily.Finally the Hermes crew - the spaceship manned by Watneys fellow rocketeers still believing him dead - making their long tedious trip home are informed of the situation. Jessica Chastain is Melissa Lewis the flight commander whose decision it was to leave Watney behind; Kate Mara is the crews tech expert; Michael PeA+-a pilots the Hermes; Aksel Hennie is the chemist onboard; and Sebastian Stan is the flight doctor. Zero G-ing around in space they assess the news deciding what if anything they can do.The Martian doesnt have the aura of existential doom that permeates Scotts Alien and it lacks the moviemaking virtuosity of a more recent lost-in-space extravaganza Alfonso CuarA3ns Oscar-winning Gravity. But The Martian is stirring and powerful boasting a commanding performance from Damon.If this Watney guy can keep alive - and keep his sanity - 50 million miles from home maybe theres still hope for us Earthbound schmos after all.sreaphillynews.com215-854-5629Steven_Rea The Martian 1/2 (Out of four stars) Directed by Ridley Scott.

When a freak accident (wind-loosed antenna piercing bio-monitor) leads to his being stranded on the red planet astro-botanist Matt Damon decides he aint got time to muse on fate the fragility of existence or mans place in the universe. Not when theres rations to number schedules to draw up and basic questions of survival to be answered (in an audio diary that works nicely to provide explanatory voiceover). As he puts it ""Im going to have to science the shit out of this."" Ridley Scotts (Exodus Gods and Kings) nuts-and-bolts answer to the existential drama of Alfonso Cuarons Gravity works best when it keeps its camera on Damon -- whose usually impervious puss actually manages to show signs of strain and stress -- as he takes care of business and deals with various disasters. (Not pictured what he does with the empty hours in between.) The film flattens out a bit when dealing with the thoroughly (and dully) decent crew who left him behind and gets downright goofy when it touches down on earth to show NASA and Jet Propulsion Labs scramble to save their man. (Donald Glovers visual reveal of his rescue plan is hilarious but not in the way it intends to be.)

After 90 years of making movies about Earthlings landing on Mars the film industry has finally produced a great one Ridley Scotts The Martian is a thrilling adventure that also happens to be based on sound science for the most part. Matt Damon in one of his most complete complex wide-ranging intimately nuanced and appealing performances plays the title character. He is American astronaut Mark Watney a construct of American novelist Andy Weir (who is the son of a physicist and who has his own background in computer science). Weir set down a plausible foundation for the story and Scotts filmmaking team used that as its template -- including in the excellent special effects -- while ignoring some matters such as Martian gravity and the extreme temperature range on the Red Planet. In this story set in the near future Watney is part of a manned American mission to Mars. But when a Martian storm creates a crisis that forces an emergency evacuation Watney is left for dead by his commander. Jessica Chastains guilt-ridden Melissa Lewis now leads her crew safely to their spaceship which heads home to Planet Earth. During that odyssey NASA officials suddenly realize that there is activity around the abandoned Hab (or Martian habitat pods where the astronauts live during their visit). Watney is obviously alive. A rescue mission may -- or may not -- be launched. It depends on the circumstances the chances of success the budget and the science involved in speeding up a mission before Watney dies of hunger thirst disease or disaster. Damon has joked that if he became boring in his solo sequences as a high-tech outer space Robinson Crusoe filmmaker Scott could juice up the action by cutting back to the crew in the spaceship and back to the people back on Earth who are concerned with his fate as the story unfolds. No worries. Scotts film editor does cut back-and-forth of course but Damon is as thrilling to watch as the action scenes. Sometimes witty-funny sometimes acerbic sometimes profane sometimes resigned to his inevitable death even while plotting how to make do as long as possible the actor is a wonder to behold. Damon now in his prime makes us feel his characters emotional mood swings inner torments and indomitable will to survive. This is true even when we sense plot points coming from millions of kilometres away (for the record the distance between Earth and Mars ranges from 56 million to 401 million kilometres depending on each planets orbit). There are several pods of interest in The Martian besides Damons exploits as Mark Watney even though we do like watching him innovate grow potatoes burn hydrazine to produce water and show off his other survivalist skills. One pod is the spaceship with Chastain and other key astronauts played by among others Kate Mara and Michael Pena. Another pod is at NASA (in Houston) and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (in Pasadena) where an excellent support cast grabs our attention. Among them are Jeff Daniels Chiwetel Ejiofor Donald Glover Kristen Wiig and even Sean Bean who generates an amusing cross-reference by sitting in on a Lord of the Rings in-joke among the science geeks. Still another pod is in China where scientists there confer on whether they should help the Americans. The welcome twist is that the fate of Watney becomes an international matter not just an American concern. Like Alfonso Cuarons wonderful close-space thriller Gravity Scotts The Martian is all the more interesting because it is linked with possibilities and even probabilities. With fresh news of scientific evidence that water may exist in a flowing state on the surface of Mars that planet is a lure for human exploration. NASA cooperated with Scotts project because officials see the benefits of promoting travel to Mars; in turn that helped the filmmakers and benefited audiences. So the bottom line is impressive Mars fires up the imagination holds you in thrall and delivers an intelligent well-executed adventure that may just be a harbinger of what is to come in real life.

Matt Damon in one of his most complete complex wide-ranging intimately nuanced and appealing performances plays the title character. He is American astronaut Mark Watney a construct of American novelist Andy Weir (who is the son of a physicist and who has his own background in computer science). Weir set down a plausible foundation for the story and Scotts filmmaking team used that as its template -- including in the excellent special effects -- while ignoring some matters such as Martian gravity and the extreme temperature range on the Red Planet. In this story set in the near future Watney is part of a manned American mission to Mars. But when a Martian storm creates a crisis that forces an emergency evacuation Watney is left f Also in this article The Martian trailer Top stories Popular Latest Videos Bullets fly at Christie Pits park boot camp Mayor John Tory kicks off the dancing at start of Caribbean Carnival parade Police ID man killed in rooming house Suicide Squad Who are the villains populating DCs next hit?

Comments (3) click to enlarge The Martian Video Rated PG-13  142 minutes  2015 Imagine Ridley Scotts predicament when two months before the release of his sci-fi adventure The Martian NASA informed him on the down-low that it had discovered water on Mars. In The Martian Matt Damon plays a U.S. astronaut mistakenly left behind on the red planet; forced to improvise he manufactures his own water by burning the rocket fuel hydrazine to release hydrogen which then combines with the oxygen in his little laboratory to create condensation. But now NASA has announced evidence of briny water flowing beneath the surface of Mars and wetting the ground facts that would have been well known to our futuristic hero. These things happen in the sci-fi game but its an unlucky break for a filmmaker like Scott--since the days of Alien (1979) and Blade Runner (1982) hes put across some truly fantastical conceits by coating his stories with a sheen of hard science.

Aidan Monaghan/Courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox hide caption toggle caption Aidan Monaghan/Courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox Astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) faces insurmountable odds as he tries to survive on a hostile planet. Aidan Monaghan/Courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox The filmmaker who did more than any other to bum us all out about space travel now wants us to feel inspired by it again. Thats the rough arithmetic behind The Martian the feel-good (and real good) NASA-condoned Damon-powered survival adventure flick from director Ridley Scott. More a visual stylist than an exponent of any particular worldview Scott made the feminist road movie Thelma and Louise the Best Picture-winning swords-and-sandals epic Gladiator and about 20 other features. But the two thatll have their titles chiseled on his tombstone are still his second and third Alien and Blade Runner. Set respectively in the 22nd century and um 2019 this influential pair shared a vision of the future that can be summed up in one word Worse. Released just a decade after Neil Armstrongs great leap for mankind Alien imagined our manifest interplanetary destiny as utterly routine -- a mercenary endeavor carried out by working stiffs who dont especially like or trust one another all on the payroll of a powerful corporation that doesnt blink before sacrificing their lives. Crew Expendable the secret orders in the ships computer said. The Martian resoundingly rejects all that. Bright thematically can-do fast-paced almost to a fault and fundamentally optimistic The Martian is science fiction of the infinitely more comforting Star Trek strain. We will solve this daunting problem by working together it coos. When someone decodes a secret message in this movie it isnt a death order. Its a lifeline. Adapted intact by geek-TV veteran Drew Goddard from computer programmer Andy Weirs (initially) self-published novel The Martian avers that humanitys interplanetary ambassadors -- the few up there aboard the Hermes and the many supporting them back here on Earth -- will be the noblest most inventive most courageous of us. No wonder NASA loves this movie. But even adjusting for flattery its an easy film to love -- one so suspenseful and funny and just richly consistently good you might get mad at it falling a few astronomical units short of great. If it gets a generation of seventh-graders fired up about science Ill happily swallow my nitpicks about overcaffeinated pacing and underdeveloped relationships wah wah wah. For those who havent read Weirs wildly clever and original book its almost a spoiler to say there are no cowards or backstabbers or greedheads in The Martian and precious few tortured pragmatists. The storys big and only bad is the hostile countryside of the Red Planet (played onscreen by Wadi Rum Jordan star of Lawrence of Arabia among others) where Mark Watney -- the indefatigable botanist-astronaut played by Matt Damon -- finds himself stranded after his crewmates leave him for dead. (Its not their fault in the parlance of an old Matt Damon movie.) Stirred from his slumber by a low-oxygen alarm in his spacesuit Watney binds his wounds (this is the second Ridley Scott joint in recent years to feature graphic stomach-stapling) and starts puzzling out how to keep himself from exploding suffocating freezing or starving until the next Mars expedition lands. In four years. In a spot thousands of barren kilometers away. If the more craven among our species (hey what are you looking at me for?) mightve liked to see Damon lean into the crushing isolation and hopelessness of Watneys predicament just a little harder -- an existential reckoning also absent from Weirs novel -- its still enormously satisfying to watch him MacGyver his way out of one malice-free deathtrap then another and another. And all he can do to celebrate another day of livin is maybe sprinkle some Vicodin on his half-a-potato dinner and raid a crewmates stash of 70s TV shows and music -- a running joke that gives the movie license to indulge in some on-the-nose-but-welcome song selections notably David Bowies ""Starman"" and that one by Gloria Gaynor. The films clean airy look comes courtesy of the same production designer cinematographer and editor with whom Scott collaborated on his prior decidedly less scientific sci-fi 2012s Prometheus. While he and Damon are both in fine form here its ultimately Weirs genius that their work preserves. Hes the guy who figured out how Watney might convert hydrazine (rocket fuel) into water grow food and even phone home -- an SOS that spurs NASA to put everything aside and devote all its mighty human and material resources to Watneys rescue. In space no one can hear you scream but here on Earth? Hey guy Everyone is working around the clock and cheering and praying just for you. Can it possibly be worth it? This interruption of a grander mission to save a single life? Watney like his crewmates is clearly prepared to sacrifice himself in the name of scientific progress. Jeff Daniels as the administrator of NASA -- a decisive leader where other movies wouldve made him a careerist worm -- is the only person who even dares to ask. This insoluble moral calculus got more play in Weirs book. Its de-emphasized in the movie perhaps because This Very Question was already mulled in Saving Private Ryan where the just-one-life in question was ... uh Matt Damons. That examination isnt the only casualty of The Martians compression even at a 140-minute run time. We barely get to know Watneys crewmates for example though they become key to his salvation. Led by Jessica Chastains steely eyed Commander Lewis (who gets a possibly negotiated more direct hand in the finale than she had in the book) theyre all smart and loyal and kinda dull and suspiciously good-looking even after many months in space. Indeed The Martian is one of several current films that populates even its smallest roles with actors who are more than capable and yet so famous it becomes distracting Chiwetel Ejiofor Kristen Wiig Kate Mara Sean Bean Donald Glover (Black Mass and Everest suffer from this same weird syndrome.) But its clearly Damons show. If it never quite seems like hes hurting as much as he oughtta be -- even when we catch a rare late glimpse of his wizened malnourished body -- the depth of my investment in Watneys survival still caught me surprise. (So I cried a little. Is that what you want me to say?) This resonant emotional chord isnt the product of a single masterful scene like Tom Hanks silent dissolution at the end of Captain Phillips; instead its the accrued effect of a team of talented and committed professionals working in harmony toward a shared and noble end. There are worse ideas you could take away from a blockbuster.

"The Martian is out of this world review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Martian is out of this world review Ridley Scotts The Martian isnt just an excellent sci-fi yarn. Its one of the years best movies and 3D experiences a crackerjack adventure that celebrates ingenuity over contrivance.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Oct. 1 2015The MartianStarring Matt Damon Jessica Chastain Chiwetel Ejiofor Jeff Daniels Kristen Wiig Michael Pena and Sean Bean. Directed by Ridley Scott. At GTA theatres. 141 minutes. PGGive Ridley Scott a great story and even the sky is no limit.And The Martian isnt just an excellent yarn. Its one of the years best movies and widescreen 3D experiences a crackerjack adventure that celebrates human ingenuity over mechanical contrivance.Article Continued BelowThis triumphant return to outer space for Scott who directed Alien and Prometheus adapts the best-selling novel by Andy Weir which began as a self-published e-book. (The screenplay is by Drew Goddard director and co-writer of The Cabin in the Woods an ingenious horror thriller.)Matt Damon uses a lot of ingenuity to survive day to day in The Martian.  (Giles Keyte)  Matt Damons stranded Mars astronaut Mark Watney also has to employ do-it-yourself strategies if he hopes to survive. Hes left alone but not forlorn after a six-person expedition to the red planet led by Jessica Chastains Commander Lewis is forced to make an emergency evacuation.Lost in a dust storm Watney is presumed dead. The shock of his miraculous survival quickly turns to sky-high suspense as NASA and his crewmates contemplate a high-risk rescue mission one that on paper could take years -- unless they find a way to speed things up. Houston has more than one problem. Politics and public relations also intrude as hardnosed NASA chief Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) considers the very real possibility that a failed rescue bid could result in six dead astronauts rather than one. Watney must use his wits and science knowledge to buy time. NASA this week announced it has found water on Mars which seems like a fantastic (and deliberate) promotion for the movie. But that could actually detract from the exceedingly clever and scientifically accurate methods Watney employs to deal with urgent food and water issues.One thing Watneys not in short supply of is a great sense of humor which Damon delivers in an A-OK performance that invites Oscar attention.Chiwetel Ejiofor Kristen Wiig Michael Pena Sean Bean and Donald Glover (AKA rapper Childish Gambino) join the stellar cast in a film that also gets the look of space travel right. Spacecraft and spacesuits are based on NASA prototypes and Jordans otherworldly Wadi Rum region makes a convincing stand-in for the rugged desert terrain of Mars.I call The Martian ""real-fi"" rather than ""sci-fi"" because its so down-to-Earth in its realism both on this blue planet and the distant red one. More than anything though its just a great time at the movies.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

(20th Century Fox image.) Science helps sell the fiction of The Martian By Gail Pennington St. Louis Post-Dispatch Gail Pennington Oct 1 2015 (...) Matt Damon is alone on Mars in ""The Martian."" (20th Century Fox image.) Left for dead an astronaut wakes up alone and injured on Mars.He has enough food for 400 ""sols"" (a Martian day) but potential rescue is four years away. How can he survive?Science of course. Science and a sense of humor. Matt Damon perfectly cast as astronaut Mark Watney in ""The Martian"" makes us care not just about his wisecracks but also about his science. The latter is a credit to Andy Weirs novel as adapted by Drew Goddard and smartly directed by Ridley Scott.The setup has a team of U.S. astronauts 18 days into a Mars mission when a catastrophic sand storm whips up. As they attempt to evacuate Mark disappears and his vital signs blink out. Mission commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) is forced to take off without even recovering his body or risk losing the whole crew.Mark isnt dead. After patching himself up though he faces a future in which he will surely starve to death if Mars doesnt get him first.There are no space aliens in ""The Martian"" no little green men or beautiful blue women. Instead this is an action movie with botany as Mark tries to farm potatoes in a place where nothing grows and chemistry as he works to turn rocket fuel into water. Theres technology as he eventually begins to communicate with Earth. Dont be skeptical; all this is riveting. In a device effectively adapted from the book Mark communicates with the audience and keeps the first third of ""The Martian"" from being a silent movie via video diaries in which he records the ups and downs of his efforts to stay alive.Although emotions do get the better of him at some points he most often bounces back with self-deprecation gallows humor and an F-word or two. (Marks language which irks NASA is the only reason a sensitive parent might not take kids to ""The Martian."")Back on Earth once NASA realizes Mark is alive the drive is on to save him and the whole world roots for the effort to succeed. Jeff Daniels plays the pragmatic head of NASA with Sean Bean as the mission commander and Kristen Wiig as the PR chief. The big Earth-bound cast also includes Chiwetel Ejiofor Donald Glover (""Community"") and Benedict Wong. The movie skimps on letting the audience get to know Marks crew even though Chastain gets second billing and is a key player in the end game. You can easily guess what that end game is; theres never a doubt even as NASA scrambles for solutions what the answer will be only how it will be executed.That doesnt detract from the enjoyment of ""The Martian"" a gorgeous film that could inspire a whole new crop of astronauts. But dont let seeing the movie stop you from reading the book.What ""The Martian""  Three stars out of four  Run time 222  Rating PG-13  Content Strong language and some intense scenes Gail Pennington  314-340-8136TV criticgailpennington on Twittergpenningtonpost-dispatch.com Tags Movie Review The Martian Matt Damon Andy Weir Ridley Scott Gail Pennington Gail Pennington Gail Pennington is the television critic for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

Meanwhile NASA tries to figure out a way to bring him home. Ridley Scotts film about an astronaut (Matt Damon) stranded on Mars is funnier and more entertaining than you might think. Its not heavy lifting but it is a love letter to science.Matt Damon is funny and heartfelt as a stranded astronaut in ""The Martian.""(Photo Twentieth Century Fox)Story HighlightsCritics rating 4 stars out of 5Matt Damon is outstanding funny and heartfeltThe supporting cast hits all the right notes especially Jeff Daniels and Chiwetel EjioforWhen ""Star Wars"" came out in 1977 there were stories of people watching the movie leaving the theater and getting back in line to see it again.Its nice to imagine people doing the same with ""The Martian"" except that every single person in the perpetual line is a science teacher. This is their moment.Movies that feature astronauts often go to great lengths to remind us that the men and women who travel into space arent just brave theyre also really smart. Remember Tom Hanks (playing real-life astronaut Jim Lovell) working out the insanely complex math in ""Apollo 13"" in seconds to avert disaster? Or a little less believably Sandra Bullock relearning and remembering how to fly various spacecraft in ""Gravity?""""The Martian"" Ridley Scotts enormously entertaining movie about an astronaut stranded on Mars celebrates science in a way that makes it exciting and useful -- life-saving even. It probably wont prevent backward-thinking politicians from continuing to cut critical funding that helps support more of that dang ol book learnin but we can always hope.AZCENTRALMatt Damon on The Martian top directors and going back to Jason BourneThe film begins with a crew of astronauts on Mars. A big storm hits so big they have to evacuate the planet but not before Mark Watney (Matt Damon born to it) gets clobbered by an antenna and is left for dead.Except of course hes not. Though he might as well be. He has enough rations to last 400 days (or ""sols"" in NASA terminology). The next mission to Mars is scheduled to arrive in four years -- and no one knows hes alive.You dont have to be as smart as an astronaut to know that this isnt good. The balance of the film is spent with Watney -- a botanist handily enough so he has a leg up in the food-growing department -- figuring out how to stay alive and let everyone else know he is so they can bring him home.AZCENTRAL10 space movies that are out of this worldHe speaks into a camera for a video diary in case he dies and the next crew will know what happened. But hes determined not to die on Mars. Buckling down to get started he utters a line that every teacher should love ""Im going to have to science the (expletive) out of this."" (Famed scientist Neil deGrasse Tyson has proclaimed on Twitter that its his favorite line in the trailer.)Scott directed ""Blade Runner"" and ""Alien"" so you might think hes going for something similarly heavy here. Hes not. The script by Drew Goddard and based on the book by Andy Weir is surprisingly funny even though the stakes are never less than life or death.Damon is terrific. But this is by no means a one-man show. The supporting cast includes Jessica Chastain Kristen Wiig Jeff Daniels Kate Mara Michael Pena Sean Bean Donald Glover and Chiwetel Ejiofor. Thats a talented bunch and if its members are not always given enough to do Damons good-natured optimistic performance makes up for the loss.AZCENTRALThe Martian (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsBecause ultimately it comes back to him. We arent just hoping he will survive -- geez youd have to be a pretty hard-hearted sort not to no matter what actor was in the role. With Damon front and center for so much of the movie Watney is someone we want to spend time with while hes on Mars which is sort of antithetical to his desires. He wants to get home.Scott and Damon make it immensely enjoyable to watch as he and the rest of his team try to figure out how.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Director Ridley Scott rediscovers the light touch hes been missing in recent misfires such as Prometheus The Counselor and Exodus Gods and Kings. Scotts film version of the bestselling debut novel by space nerd Andy Weir fires on all cylinders fueled by a heroically entertaining performance from Matt Damon. OK its not a deep-think piece like Interstellar (in which Damon had a malevolent cameo) or 2001 A Space Odyssey. And there are no little green monsters busting out of human cavities like in Scotts Alien. But The Martian with a you-are-there script by Drew Goddard works you over without a hint of dystopian doom in all of its bracing 142 minutes. This suspenseful survival tale smartass to its core slaps a smile on your face that youll wear all the way home. More News Fall Movie Preview 2015 From James Bond to Star Wars The Top 20 Sci-Fi Films of the 21st Century 10 Best Things We Saw at 2015 Toronto Film Festival Watch Matt Damon Fight to Survive in The Martian Trailer All Stories >> Related Matt Damon and Ridley Scott on The Martian How the star and filmmaker turned a lost-in-space tale into a funny harrowing survivalist epic ""Im pretty much fucked"" are the first words Weir puts in the mouth of astronaut Mark Watney (Damon). After only 18 sols (a sol is a day in Martian-speak) this NASA botanist has been left for dead on the Red Planet. His crew including Michael Pena Kate Mara Aksel Hennie and Sebastian Stan all under the command of a no-bull Jessica Chastain believe he died in a freak dust storm his spacesuit and torso punctured by a flying antenna. So they abort the mission and head back to Earth where Watney is mourned as a martyr. Cue the complications. Satellite photos reveal that Watney is still alive using botany ingenuity to survive. He even grows potatoes -- youll never guess whose manure he uses as fertilizer. But how is he going to ""science the shit out of"" his plight and stay alive for the four years itll take to land a rescue mission (he has enough food for only a month)? You do the math. Actually you dont have to since the NASA director (Jeff Daniels) his Mars expert (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and their harried PR guru (Kristen Wiig of all people) are back home sweating out a solution. Will the original crew members still in transit to Earth risk their lives on a rescue mission? Ill put it this way The space program hasnt had a propaganda boost this effective since Apollo 13. As he was in Saving Private Ryan Damon is again a symbol of the American determination to leave no man behind. Related Watch Matt Damon Jimmy Kimmel Take Feud to Couples Therapy Actor reveals hes lived in a Kimmel dressing room for 12 years waiting to appear on show Cornball? Maybe. But The Martian is a hell of a joyride. Kudos to Scott his FX team and the gifted cinematographer Dariusz Wolski shooting in Jordan to rep Mars. Nice touch too having the diversion-starved Watney forced to rely on a collection of disco hits left behind by his commander. Some things really are unforgivable. Going nearly two years without company (think Castaway or a longer Gravity) with only the occasional ""fuck you Mars"" to show frustration Watney comes close to coming apart. Luckily Damon -- a fine actor with the magnetism you only find in a true movie star -- keeps you glued to the film. Youre with him all the way.

Meanwhile NASA tries to figure out a way to bring him home. Matt Damon is an astronaut who must draw upon his ingenuity to survive an alien planet in The Martian.(Photo Giles Keyte 20th Century Fox Film)Sure water was just found on our neighboring planet but even with that milestone Matt Damon still might be the best thing ever to happen to Mars.As an astronaut stranded on the desolate landscape of another world the A-lister powers the awesome combo of adventure humor and human drama in The Martian (1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide) director Ridley Scotts latest venture into the sci-fi genre. Instead of aliens or replicants the biggest antagonists in front of Damons Mark Watney in the adaptation of Andy Weirs novel are time and the wild and woolly nature of outer space.The manned mission of Ares III is wrapping up and heading home when a wicked storm cuts Watney off from the rest of the crew (including Jessica Chastain Kate Mara Michael Pena and Sebastian Stan). They presume hes dead as does NASA director Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) who has to handle the potential PR nightmare back home alongside his embattled media-relations chief (Kristen Wiig).USA TODAYIn Martian Damon is a castaway for selfie generationHowever a little sandy but not too worse for wear Watney ends up surviving though he has to use his smarts and ingenuity to figure out how to stay alive until NASA can figure out how to come get him. But as he deadpans ""Mars will come to fear my botany powers.""He gets his math on divvying up rations and uses his feces as fertilizer to grow potatoes in a DIY greenhouse collecting condensation as water. When Watney has to get across the planet so he can find a rendezvous point he rejiggers a space vehicle to meet the situation at hand. Its hard to believe any ""super-botanist"" is quite this good at his job but Damon totally sells what is arguably his most likable role in years with a balance of charming personality and compelling need to cheer hard for this guy.In Damons favor is the planetary setting Scotts team has fashioned. As Watney tools around the Red Planet Mars sandy beauty is alien wondrous in ways yet also feels exceedingly real -- just as much as it does inside the astronauts man-made workspace.The stranded Earth mans story is the most interesting yet Scott also manages to craft important subplots elsewhere in the universe. NASA has to work with other countries -- and a gifted young engineer (played with winning kookiness by Donald Glover) -- to figure out the science of saving their golden boy. Meanwhile the Ares team faces its own problem Do they risk going back for Watney and lose that much more time with the families and relationships that are near and dear to them?USA TODAYPresenting the funniest tweets about water on MarsThe supporting cast is an embarrassment of riches for Scott and Chastain is particularly strong as the concerned commander of the mission. Yet this is most definitely Damons movie and a throwback to the unabashed idealism of Hollywood past. One would be hard-pressed to find a single space rock of darkness or cynicism in The Martian which instead chooses to be a love letter to yesteryears manifest destiny of reaching toward the stars as well as embracing the human spirits willingness to say ""(Screw) you Mars"" when the chips are majorly down.Much like Tom Hanks talking to a volleyball in Cast Away Damon telling space potatoes that hes technically the first guy to colonize Mars shows us how we all would hope to bravely face certain doom in a foreign place. ""In your face Neil Armstrong"" Watney proudly states in a movie thats one small step for Damon and one giant leap of galactic goodness. 1837 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDIN 20 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1KPgFgI",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/10/01/the-martian-matt-damon-review/73067020/,200,themartian22,themartian,usatoday

Close Join the conversation... With Chris Vognar Share This Story Share Discuss Meh In space as Ridley Scotts Alien once reminded us no one can hear you scream. But in The Martian they can hear you crack jokes curse up a storm at ground patrol and crow about your botany prowess. Scotts charming nerdfest of a sci-fi adventure is the most good-humored movie youre ever likely to see about a man marooned on a desolate planet.Its also a whole lot of Matt Damon whose stranded astronaut Mark Watney spends a good chunk of the film telling a video log and the audience how he intends to survive on the red planet until he can get some help. See Mark explain his newest scientific gambit. Watch him execute said gambit. Mix. Stir. Repeat. Its a pleasant enough experience even if it gets glib pretty fast and repetitive shortly thereafter. The Martian is fueled by charm curiosity and the scientific method. It plays like a modernized Kennedy-age fantasy of discovery space and can-do initiative. As Mark himself explains the process ""If you solve all the problems you get to come home.""Marks crew which includes Jessica Chastain and Michael PeA+-a and doesnt have a whole lot to do through the course of the movie has fled Mars after a sudden storm. The crew members have lost contact with their comrade. They think hes dead. The head of NASA played by a perfectly bureaucratic Jeff Daniels is chagrined when everyone discovers the fallen astronaut has in fact risen. This means they have to bring him back. And that task requires -- you guessed it -- a lot of science.And a lot of political infighting. The Martians peppiest sequences revolve around the suits and technicians scrambling back on Earth to devise Marks return. This is where youll find the films best supporting players including Daniels; Chiwetel Ejiofor as the head of Mars missions; Kristen Wiig as NASAs icy PR honcho; and Benedict Wong as the calm but harried guy solving problems over at Jet Propulsion Laboratories. Matt Damon in ""The Martian."" Aidan Monaghan/20th Century Fox via AP The dialogue they speak was written by Drew Goddard who adapted the screenplay from Andy Weirs novel. But if you close your eyes youll hear an echo of Aaron Sorkins hyperclever back-and-forth wonkiness (which will be front and center with the Oct. 16 Dallas release of Steve Jobs).Meanwhile as the earthlings plan and squabble Mark just gets stuff done. He wouldnt care much about this weeks news of water on Mars because he knows how to make his own out of hydrogen and oxygen. Not enough food? Plant some potatoes using fertilizer made from human waste. Need to communicate? Bust out the ol hexadecimal alphabet. Mark is like an outer space MacGyver who paid close attention in his science classes.Scotts Mars looks a little like an HD version of John Fords Monument Valley with a red tint. The Martian doesnt really strive for visual awe or cosmic wonder; for those qualities youre better off returning to Gravity. In fact the past couple of years have brought a fascinating variety of approaches to big-screen cosmos from the spiritual inspiration of Gravity to the high-flown (and muddled) philosophy of Interstellar and now the cool-headed rationality of The Martian. In case you didnt notice theres a whole lot of room out there to explore. THE MARTIAN (B+)Directed by Ridley Scott. Rated PG-13 (some strong language injury images and brief nudity). 141 mins.

He must survive and find a way to contact Earth. (  / 20th Century Fox) The conspiracy-minded among us could be forgiven their suspicions when NASA announced evidence of liquid water on the surface of Mars just days before the opening of ""The Martian."" In addition to being an old-school sci-fi thriller Ridley Scotts tale of a plucky astronaut stranded on the Red Planet also happens to be a big wet kiss aimed straight at the researchers and technological whiz kids at the federal space agency. After all more than a few truthers insist the moon landing was dreamed up on a Hollywood soundstage. Whats a little marketing tie-in and victory lap between friends? It turns out that ""The Martian"" doesnt need extra help. Whats being marketed as a sober straightforward sci-fi drama (the words ""Bring him home"" superimposed on an unsmiling Matt Damon inside a space helmet) is instead a smart exhilarating often disarmingly funny return to classic adventures of yore. Imagine George Clooneys wisecracking character from ""Gravity"" fetching up on Mars only to be the subject of an ""Apollo 13""-style rescue mission and you get a sense of what part of fictional outer space ""The Martian"" occupies. Refreshingly irreverent but unapologetically worshipful when it comes to honoring real-life science this bracing riff on exploration gumption and ingenuity shows what Big Movies can do when they resist taking themselves too seriously. What could have been a disposable genre exercise or fashionably po-faced downer instead is a fun rousing thoroughly entertaining kick in the pants. And Damon -- recent real-life gaffes notwithstanding -- is just the guy to deliver it. As Mark Watney a botanist who gets separated from his space station team during an epic sandstorm Damon embodies just the right measure of confidence and self-deprecatory vulnerability to make his character a slightly goofy Everyman -- even as hes expertly MacGyvering his way from one outlandish work-around to the next. [The ups and downs of Matt Damons highly unfortunate press tour] Kristen Wiig and Chiwetel Ejiofor star as members of a NASA team tasked with bringing home astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) after a sandstorm leaves him stranded on Mars. (Peter Mountain/Twentieth Century Fox) Once Watney discovers that hes been left for dead he doesnt succumb to despair but flies into action recording his plight on a video log that serves as audience surrogate. Helpfully explaining each problem its life-and-death stakes and how he will solve it Watney then goes about the drudgery and hard work that defines day-to-day survival. Meanwhile back on Earth a NASA team composed of Kristen Wiig Chiwetel Ejiofor and Jeff Daniels -- at his deadpan best as the agencys somewhat cynical director -- scramble desperately to bring Watney home before his food potable water and PR potential run out. [In this movie science itself becomes an action hero] The fact that ""The Martian"" has been directed by Scott -- the man who made the future look so un-bright in ""Blade Runner"" and ""Alien"" -- comes as something of a shock considering its sunnily wholesome tone. But the filmmaker brings his signature sense of detail spectacle and startling beauty to a production that switches easily and evocatively from ochre and sienna sandscapes -- suggestive of a grand intergalactic Monument Valley -- to techno-sleek command centers. The telling difference in this production is the script which has been adapted by Drew Goddard from a book by Andy Weir While keeping several narrative balls in the air (have we gotten to the Earthbound space capsule commanded by Jessica Chastain? Or the young astrodynamics prodigy played by Donald Glover?) Goddard injects an impressive amount of sophisticated humor into otherwise dry recitals of factoids and ""Hey Ive got an idea"" self-interruptions. Chief among its many strengths may be that ""The Martian"" is the only sci-fi action adventure in cinematic history to reference both the hexadecimal numeric system and the Algonquin Round Table. Occasionally those juxtapositions can be too ingratiating by half The disco-infused soundtrack harks back a little too familiarly to ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and the film finally succumbs to bloat both in running time and hokey emotionalism. Less forgivable is the addition of 3-D to a movie that benefits not a whit from that gratuitous gimmick. With a script like this one and Damon bringing it to life so appealingly ""The Martian"" has plenty of dimension without cash-grabby bells and whistles. Its tempting to call the values of initiative enterprise and resourcefulness that ""The Martian"" extols purely American but the movie celebrates pluralism as well -- even if a plot point involving the Chinese space program may have more to do with the booster technology of that countrys funding sources and markets than with high-minded ideals. Either way at a time when a kid can get busted for bringing a DIY clock to school presidential candidates seriously debate the value of vaccinations and even the Pope cant win over global warming skeptics the problem-solving valorized in ""The Martian"" provides a simultaneously stirring and spirited example of how cool science can be. As NASA-Hollywood plots go this one is worth lapping up like all the water on Mars. PG-13. At area theaters.

"The Martian review Damon tries to MacGyver his way back to Earth - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies The Martian review Matt Damon tries to MacGyver his way back to Earth The Martian Aidan Monaghan Twentieth Century Fox/AP Matt Damon in a scene from the film ""The Martian."" Matt Damon in a scene from the film ""The Martian."" (Aidan Monaghan Twentieth Century Fox/AP) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Mars needs Damon And Damon runs the show in Ridley Scotts engaging tribute to problem-solving. A highly enjoyable zestily acted team-building exercise with Matt Damon playing the team of one director Ridley Scotts ""The Martian"" throws a series of life-or-death scenarios at its resourceful botanist-astronaut stranded on Mars but making the most of it. Its one of the most comforting science fiction films in years.""Im not gonna die here"" Damons character Mark Watney declares early on to the camera. Left for dead by his crew amid a monstrous windstorm in which hes thought to be killed by flying debris Watney must solve a crazy array of challenges beginning with finding a way to signal his survival to grief-stricken NASA colleagues back home. His extended solo improvisation exercise finds Watney keeping a video log of sorts. (Its a movie so he has to; he cant write things down and hope we guess what hes thinking about.) What to eat for example once the prepackaged pouches of NASA food run out? The answer learn to grow potatoes in soil not hospitable to growing potatoes. The making of ""The Martian"" preceded this weeks news that definitive signs of liquid water have been located on Mars surface.Based on Andy Weirs diary-form novel ""The Martian"" serves as a less fraught (if also less visually arresting) bookend to Alfonso Cuarons ""Gravity."" Watching it you feel youre getting useful lessons from a hardy life coach in accentuating the positive and not panicking under duress. Or how to fake it anyway. Despite some similarities to ""Gravity"" Scotts film is very different in its tone and in its inclusion of ""meanwhile back home"" stories all of which become part of a global effort to retrieve the guy left behind by accident. The time is a few years in the future at which point the U.S. government has somehow found the money and the interest in a manned Mars space program. Jessica Chastain plays the stalwart commander of the six-person crew of the Hermes spacecraft wrapping up the third-ever mission to Mars. The commander must decide Do we all die attempting a rescue of our colleague Watney whos almost 100 percent certainly dead or do we save the others?

(ScreenPlay) See more videos NASA officials (Jeff Daniels plays the head; Chiwetel Ejiofor portrays the Mars missions director) are the first to learn Watney is alive. Theyre reluctant to inform the surviving Hermes team making the long trip home to Earth. In ""The Martian"" loyalty plus guilt counts for everything. The expansive nicely fleshed-out script by Drew Goddard keeps introducing lively new characters that become crucial to Watneys fate.This is no zippy-skippy time frame a la ""Gravity"" which managed to imperil (and imperil and imperil) its astronaut protagonist and ultimately save her in a narrative matter of hours. Watneys a wiseacre which helps pass the time -- for him and for the audience -- when at one point in his multiyear improv lesson he embarks on a 50-day road trip. Some of the jokes in ""The Martian"" are pretty corny many of them involving Watneys resistance to a crew members penchant for disco. Those who prefer their science fiction more dour and dire may resist the films fuzzy humanist impulse. I found it refreshing and sincere. Even the tightly wound NASA public relations maven played by Kristen Wiig has something like a human pulse. And that is Damons enduring appeal as both a movie star and as an actor. He has a way of making a superhumanly cool-headed cucumber feel like a relatable earthling.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Ridley Scotts space operas have been pretty bleak. ""Alien"" and its follow-up prologue ""Prometheus"" carried us to places where everyone can hear you scream. ""Blade Runner"" brought killer androids from their slave confines on extraterrestrial colonies to destroy their creators on Earth. Scotts goal has been to make us unsettled not uplifted. Unlike the ""Star Trek"" franchise hes never inspired NASA engineers. Until now that is. ""The Martian"" a survival story about an astronaut stranded on the red planet is by far the most inspiring entry in the 77-year-old directors ample catalog. Its a big-hearted mash note to science nerds optimism grit and guts. With wonderful dramatic pacing acting subject matter Abba soundtrack anthems and ""Lord of the Rings"" jokes ""The Martian"" is a clever feel-good movie on an epic scale. A big crowd pleaser needs a central character to root for and this one has an irreverent winner in charismatic Matt Damon. He plays Mark Watney a droll botanist facing insurmountable odds as he settles in for an extended stay on Mars. After his crestfallen colleagues (including Jessica Chastain and Michael Pena) believe he died in a hellish sandstorm they evacuate the planet returning to Earth in the orbiting mother ship. The marooned Watney must spend at least four years waiting for a return flight. In a facility designed for a 31-day mission. With scant food and oxygen. It sounds like the recipe for a story of starvation and isolated cabin fever insanity but ""The Martian"" is about can-do staying power. With heroic self-reliance and witty zingers to keep his spirits up until the cavalry comes Watney films daily video diaries. ""Ive gotta figure out how to grow three years worth of food on a planet where nothing grows"" he grumbles early on. ""Mars will come to fear my botany powers"" Charting the problems he faces then solving them one by one he pushes ahead like MacGyver performing brain surgery with a Swiss Army knife. The films irresistible tone is based on Andy Weirs hit novel and scripted by Drew Goddard (director of the delicious horror spoof ""The Cabin in the Woods"" and creator of Netflixs ""Daredevil"" TV show). While harrowing stories like this usually have a supporting cast of dislikables ""The Martian"" goes in exactly the opposite direction of current science fiction. Theres not a villain onscreen. 20th Century Fox Matt Damon is ""The Martian."" Back on Earth NASA Director Teddy Sanders (played by Jeff Daniels) at first looks like a smug stuffed suit motivated to control the medias information about Watney as a way to protect his agencys public image and federal funding. But we soon realize that his cool as a cucumber control is aimed at handling the crisis with maximum efficiency. Though Damon controls the first third of the film in a largely one-man show he shares the big picture with an impressive ensemble cast. Kristen Wiig Chiwetel Ejiofor Donald Glover Benedict Wong and more deliver three-dimensional characters dramatic heft and perfectly delivered laugh lines. The ever-stylish Scott is in top form here transforming Jordanian locations into amazing Martian landscapes of blustery red sand. His story high-fives the geek geniuses at NASA and -- as Watneys story draws global attention -- their allies around the world. As it builds to its exciting and satisfying climax the film creates an inspiring tone of idealism. It makes you feel that for all the bad press we often earn sometimes it feels great to be a member of the human race. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet There are those that like to assert that science is a religion of its own. Thats utter nonsense for a variety of reasons that would require this entire review to unpack but The Martian in which an astronaut accidentally stranded on Mars decides hes going to ""science the shit"" out of his dilemma comes close to serving as the secular equivalent of faith-based inspirational films like Gods Not Dead and 90 Minutes In Heaven. Thankfully its not as ham-fisted as that genre and understands that any message should reside beneath a protective atmosphere of pure entertainment; the film works superbly as an adventure/disaster flick albeit one thats unusually focused on technical matters. Still at its heart The Martian is an unapologetically stirring celebration of our ability as a species to solve even the most daunting problems via rational thought step by step by step. Its basically Human Ingenuity The Movie.Faithfully adapted by Drew Goddard (The Cabin In The Woods) from Andy Weirs initially self-published sci-fi novel and directed by Ridley Scott The Martian imagines a near future probably just a few decades from now in which the U.S. is sending regular manned missions to the Red Planet. Early into one of them a freak storm snaps a radio antenna and sends it hurling into engineer and botanist Mark Watney (Matt Damon) apparently killing him--his biometric spacesuit indicates no sign of life and the crew reluctantly heads back to Earth without him so the storm doesnt swallow them up as well. But Watney has improbably survived and awakens to find himself completely alone on a desolate world with no hope of rescue for at least four years. His food supply (including the food for the five crew members who left) will last only a quarter of that time but Watney after a brief moment of despair decides hes not going down without a fight. Meanwhile back on Earth NASA eventually notices via satellite that hes still alive and the best minds on the planet get to work figuring out how they can help save him. Given that Jessica Chastain plays the captain of the abandoned mission accompanied by the likes of Kate Mara and Michael Pena its just possible that this may involve turning a certain spaceship around though thats not exactly as easy as turning an airplane around. (Cue Donald Glover as a manic astrodynamicist.)Sticking closely to Weirs novel which is extremely nuts-and-bolts Goddard and Scott subordinate everything to a detailed chronicle of the various difficulties Watney faces and his painstaking efforts to overcome them. All Is Lost the movie about Robert Redford alone on a sinking sailboat in the middle of the ocean memorably achieved something similar with virtually no dialogue but Watneys methods are too complex to be readily grasped by non-scientists. He maintains a regular video log explaining to the camera how for example hes converting hydrazine into water so that he can irrigate a potato farm hes managed to create from the handful of spuds that were onboard for the crews Thanksgiving dinner. And Damon has a lot of fun playing Watney as the gigantic nerd Weir conceived--the kind of guy who when ordered by NASA to provide a publicity photo decides to strike a Fonzie pose. (His hatred of disco which is the only music he can find among the crews belongings is a running gag.) Had The Martian been just a Cast Away-style survival tale with the video log serving as Wilson few would have complained.Nonetheless its the scenes set on Earth that give the film much of its inspirational punch. Weir isnt particularly skilled at dialogue or characterization (or elegant prose for that matter; hes a technician who works with words) and the actors playing NASA personnel--including Jeff Daniels Chiwetel Ejiofor Kristen Wiig Mackenzie Davis and Benedict Wong--are mostly stuck playing mouthpieces. And theres a legitimate argument to be had which the film never even raises about the ethics of spending what must be billions of dollars to rescue one astronaut when the same money could potentially save many thousands of lives at home. (Admittedly its Matt Damon who was also deemed important enough to bring home no matter the cost in Saving Private Ryan.) But the movie though decidedly America-centric imagines the entire world consumed with Watneys fate--China plays an especially key role--and theres a rousing ""We can do this"" attitude throughout thats genuinely hopeful about mankinds future. For viewers worried about climate change and other existential threats The Martian will be the rah-rah event of the year. Without ever openly stating as much it suggests that we might well all be martians one day.

Movie review The Martian Article Tweet Twentieth Century Fox Matt Damon in The Martian The Martian      (out of five) Director Ridley Scott Cast Matt Damon Jessica Chastain Chiwetel Ejiofor Rated PG-13 (strong language injury images brief nudity) Running time 141 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 400pm on Wednesday Sep. 30 2015 Wednesday Sep. 30 2015 Thursday Oct. 01 2015 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram The last time Matt Damon went into space he was a scientist driven to insanity and attempted murder after isolation on a distant ice planet in Interstellar. Now in The Martian hes once again a scientist stuck alone on a foreign planet but instead of lapsing into bitterness over his abandonment he turns into a Boy Scout with killer survival skills a dry sense of humor and a growing appreciation for disco music.If that sounds a bit loopy this is exactly what makes The Martian -- based on the bestseller by Andy Weir -- such a welcome switch from the usual serious tone of movies about people who find themselves stranded and on the edge of death. From Gravity to 127 Hours both remarkable films in their own way theres a tendency for filmmakers to aim for the awestruck and transcendent as the hero teeters on the abyss.But Mark Watney (Damon) doesnt have much time for reflection as he needs to find a way to stay alive long enough on Mars for NASA to send someone to rescue him. He has more come-to-science than come-to-Jesus moments.Hes in this situation because his team of astronauts including commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) and his best friend Rick Martinez (Michael Pena) is overwhelmed by a sandstorm thats much worse than NASA predicted. Its so bad that theyre ordered to abandon the mission and head back to Earth. But Mark is laid low by a flying piece of debris and presumed dead. When he wakes up many hours later hes totally on his own.What follows is a master class in making do as Mark trained as a botanist has to find a way to communicate with Earth make the remaining rations last create water and a conducive environment to enable potatoes to grow and not go insane -- thats where the disco comes in handy.Directed by Ridley Scott ( Blade Runner Black Hawk Down) with a surprisingly light touch The Martian maintains the humor readers liked about Weirs novel and the film is occasionally laugh-out-loud funny. Though he may be a science Superman Mark is just a regular guy who wants to get home all while grooving to Donna Summers Hot Stuff. Damon proves adept at portraying both sides of Marks personality.Meanwhile back on Earth NASA -- led by Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) -- has to navigate the tricky issue of telling the world Mark is alive after announcing his death. (Kristen Wiig is the head of public relations but she plays it fairly straight.) More to the point they have to find a way to get him back and decide if its even possible.For all of its veneer of real science The Martian does have an air of the fanciful. That Mark could be so level-headed and not prone to anger or self-pity seems beyond human and many have already dissected how ""true"" the films science is. But the general consensus is that The Martian gets a lot right. More than that -- with NASA getting help from the Chinese and a multiracial team worthy of a United Colors of Benetton ad -- the near-future of The Martian seems to be more harmonious than our current world.Not everything works. The Martian isnt as engaging in its second half as the first. It becomes more predictable as it becomes more of a rescue story and less of one about survival.Still this marks a solid return to form for Scott whose last few films ( Exodus Gods and Kings The Counselor and Prometheus) have veered from the leaden to the unwatchable. Scott may have found himself by getting lost in space. Cary Darling 817-390-7571 carydar Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

"Matt Damon in The Martian reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Martian Is Pure Hokum of the Most Satisfying Kind The Martian Is Pure Hokum of the Most Satisfying Kind Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Oct. 1 2015 1041 AM Saving Astronaut Watney Matt Damon tries to stay alive while a loyal team fights to bring him home in Ridley Scotts entertaining The Martian. By Dana Stevens Matt Damon in The Martian. Photo by Giles Keyte. Courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. A few dozen days (or as a rotation of the planet is referred to in NASA jargon ""sols"") into his lonely survival ordeal on Mars the stranded astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) delivers a kind of mission statement into the video log hes recording for posterity. Faced with the challenge of finding or creating enough food and water to survive the four years until the next mission is scheduled to reach the red planet Mark decides with the beleaguered optimism of a born survivor to ""science the shit out of this."" Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. That was pretty much also the strategy of Andy Weir who wrote the best-selling sci-fi novel on which The Martian is based. Weir a software engineer and the son of a physicist put in meticulous research to support his speculations about the viability of say indoor agriculture in a Mars habitat (Marks eventual if temporary solution to the what-to-eat problem). I couldnt say to what degree Ridley Scotts adaptation in turn sciences the shit out of Weirs source material. But Scott has against all odds broken one of the most fundamental laws of physics the tendency of systems toward entropy. Scotts recent films many of them grand-scale spectacles (Prometheus Exodus Gods and Kings) have grown progressively longer slower and more ponderous. Now suddenly the director has changed course with a movie that while certainly long--The Martian approaches 21/2 hours--feels as bouncy and light as a beach ball. Advertisement If thats not the metaphor you prefer for your sci-fi blockbusters--if you like them on the more philosophically weighty side--then there are plenty of movies out there for you already. The Martian is a nerdy process film about outer space survival with a boyish indifference to archetypal symbolism (cf. Gravity) or brooding debates about fate and free will (cf. Interstellar). Dont bother asking Damons Mark Watney how he feels about being completely alone on a planet inhospitable to human life where its very likely hell starve to death before help can reach him. Hell simply throw a spade over his shoulder repair a crack in his helmet with duct tape and head out to shovel some more good red Mars dirt. In that dirt--fertilized by the human waste left behind in vacuum-sealed packs by Mark and his former crewmates--he will grow enough potatoes to buy himself a few hundred more sols worth of food supply. Meanwhile the Hermes the spaceship on which Mark was serving as team botanist is on its way back to earth its crew members still unaware that their colleague survived the dust storm that forced them to cut their mission short. The final hour of The Martian is pure hokum albeit of the most satisfying kind. As many observers have noted The Martian isnt Matt Damons first go-round as the sole inhabitant of a hostile alien world Last year Christopher Nolans Interstellar landed the actor in a similar pickle. (Damon has also done his share of plodding through barren desertscapes here on Earth in Gus Van Sants black-comic parable Gerry.) Its easy to see why Damon would be your go-to stuck-on-a-planet actor. Hes Robinson Crusoe via the Hardy Boys stalwart without being stolid and hopeful without being (thank God) chipper. And as written by Buffy the Vampire Slayer veteran Drew Goddard--whose touch with snappy dialogue is largely responsible for The Martians unexpected buoyancy--Mark Watney is funny a quality too seldom exhibited by leading men in space. Marks ability to see the comic absurdity of his predicament even in moments of extreme peril comes to seem inseparable from his iron will to live and Damon conveys that connection without ever straining for bathos. The early scenes have an austere one-man show element with Damon interacting only with the video monitor where he records his log and the harsh Martian environment that constantly threatens to engulf him. (Many exteriors were filmed in the Wadi Rum desert in Jordan a frequent movie stand-in for the fourth planet from the Sun.) By about halfway through though the solar system of The Martian has gotten pretty crowded. In addition to a following the progress of the Hermes--captained by Jessica Chastain with a crew that includes Michael Pena and Kate Mara--the audience is gradually introduced to a boatload of supporting characters at NASAs Houston headquarters Jeff Daniels as the PR-conscious head of the space program. Chiwetel Ejiofor as the mission director who presses him to prioritize Watneys rescue once they realize the stranded botanist is still alive. Kristen Wiig as NASAs snippy director of PR (who confusingly has the same first name as her Bridesmaids character making you wonder how she went from cupcake entrepreneur to aerospace bureaucrat). Donald Glover as an entry-level astrodynamicist with a left-field idea about how to speed up the rescue mission. Top Comment ""Dont bother asking Damons Mark Watney how he feels about being completely alone on a planet inhospitable to human life where its very likely hell starve to death before help can reach him.  More... -Joe Join In The plan for Watneys rescue may rely on solid science (even if some of the last-minute MacGyvering with tarps and duct tape seems a little sketchy). But dramatically the final hour of The Martian is pure hokum albeit of the most satisfying kind. Watney tinkers with the space junk at his encampment to engineer a solar-powered roving vehicle all to the accompaniment of a left-behind playlist of vintage disco ABBA and David Bowie (no not ""Life on Mars"" but something almost as thematically apropos). Back on Earth the Chinese and the Americans agree to collaborate on an unprecedented international mission to save the stranded astronaut. Like Brad Birds Tomorrowland The Martian offers a deeply optimistic vision of the future of space travel--its utopic rather than dystopic. But unlike Tomorrowland The Martian neither scolds nor preaches. In a way its Saving Private Ryan without the World War II setting (or the breathable atmosphere)--a simple moving tale of comrades rallying to retrieve Matt Damon. Dariusz Wolskis dazzling 3-D cinematography often shows people dwarfed by the immensity of their surroundings Watney by the mountains and craters of Mars the Hermes crew by the infinite blackness of outer space even the NASA engineers huddled together under their enormous and too often useless screens. But the animating humanism of Scotts film is irreducible. Its a wry tribute to the qualities that got our species into space in the first place our resourcefulness our curiosity and our outsized ridiculous beautiful brains.

"Review Polished Martian will compute for many earthlings - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Ridley Scotts geek respect pays off in The Martian The Martian movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews ""The Martian"" starring Matt Damon. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews ""The Martian"" starring Matt Damon. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter The entire plot of ""The Martian"" a tip-top science fiction entertainment is encapsulated in the three little words that dominate the films advertising ""Bring Him Home.""Turning the plight of astronaut Mark Watney inadvertently abandoned on the planet Mars 50 million miles from Earth into the most polished of crowd-pleasers was the work of many hands not the least of which were sine qua non star Matt Damon novelist Andy Weir who wrote the original book and screenwriter Drew Goddard. Director Ridley Scott despite spending more cinematic time in the future than Buck Rogers was a late addition to ""The Martians"" team (Goddard was originally set to direct) but a crucial one.SIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter gt;gt; It was Scotts ability to join together two aspects of his filmmaking persona and in a sense bring it all back home that proved critical to ""The Martians"" success.A consummate storytelling professional and visual wizard who knows how mainstream entertainment should be put together Scotts previous science fiction films including ""Alien"" ""Blade Runner"" and ""Prometheus"" have lived on the dark end of the street. Movie and TV Martians through the years Dave Lewis The mysteries of the Red Planet have long captured the imagination of storytellers and filmmakers and Hollywood?s latest effort to grok life on Mars is Ridley Scott?s ?The Martian? in theaters this Friday.

The mysteries of the Red Planet have long captured the imagination of storytellers and filmmakers and Hollywood?s latest effort to grok life on Mars is Ridley Scott?s ?The Martian? in theaters this Friday. In the film Matt Damon plays U.S. astronaut Mark Watney but as per the title he?s arguably... (Dave Lewis) But back on planet Earth Scott in films like ""A Good Year"" and even ""Thelma amp; Louise"" has shown an interest in positive stories but its not until ""The Martian"" that a science fiction film with a hopeful tone has come out under his name. Its been worth the wait.That tone comes courtesy of Weirs strongly plotted novel which he initially gave away free chapter by chapter on his website before it became a print bestseller and was scooped up by Hollywood. Though dystopian science fiction has dominated the contemporary field for years ""The Martian"" is decidedly optimistic with a self-reliant Mr. Can Do kind of hero whose command of science comes in handy when things get rough. (Which as you can imagine on a place like Mars happens a lot.) See the most-read entertainment stories gt;gt;Open link That man would be astronaut Mark Watney (Damon) introduced as one of the six members of the Aries III team from spacecraft Hermes doing research and otherwise minding their own business in the Acidalia Planitia area of Mars.The other crew members well-cast and given more definition in the film than the book include among others steely Cmdr. Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) jokey pilot Rick Martinez (Michael Pena) and computer whiz Beth Johanssen (Kate Mara).Things start to go badly for this group when a dust storm as unexpected as it is enormous leads Lewis to decide the planet must be evacuated immediately. On the way back to the ship brutal winds unmoor a satellite dish that flattens Watney and ends all communication with him.As the rest of the distraught crew begins the 10-month journey home everyone on board not to mention everyone back on Earth thinks Watney is dead. Except hes not.It turns out that Watney wasnt killed merely knocked out and impaled by the dishs antenna. Once he gets himself to the artificial living habitat or Hab and doctors himself up hes good to go and starts keeping a video log to prove it. Which is where Damon begins to shine.Damon is as likable an American actor as we have and ideally cast to convey the pleasing self-confidence and intrepid sense of humor that characterized Watney in the book. Hes just the kind of guy to add interest to the storys considerable science and make Watneys ""Robinson Crusoe on Mars"" situation plausible.Watneys initial task is to keep himself alive for the four years until the next Mars expedition is scheduled to land and job one in that department is to procure enough food. Fortunately as Watney himself wryly comments hes the expedition botanist and he vows with mock solemnity that ""Mars will come to fear my botany powers."" Or so he hopes.But as author Weir candidly admitted in an essay in Salon ""My plan was to torture Mark.... I decided that each problem Mark faced had to be a plausible consequence of his situation -- or better yet an unintended consequence of his solution to a previous problem."" And as ensured by Goddards skillful script so it quite pleasurably goes.While Watney is mucking about on Mars it takes a bit of time for people on Earth to figure out he is in fact alive but once they do the folks at NASA start to scheme about getting him home with complications galore making their lives as difficult as Watneys.As with the crew of the Hermes excellent acting (Carmen Cuba and Nina Gold were the casting directors) makes all the difference in plausibility. Doing fine work are Jeff Daniels as the caring but cautious suit who runs NASA Chiwetel Ejiofor as the passionate director of Mars missions Sean Bean as the dogged astronaut advocate and Kristen Wiig as the beleaguered media-relations director.Special mention should be given to adroit casting for two of the films numerous nerdy roles Mackenzie Davis as an eagle-eyed satellite image viewer and Donald Glover as a Jet Propulsion Lab thinker who gets a big idea. ""The Martian"" is a film that respects the geekiest among us and that pays off all around.-----------------------The MartianMPAA rating PG-13 for some strong language injury images and brief nudityRunning time 2 hours 21 minutesPlaying In general releaseMOREFor Matt Damon movie The Martian lots of research -- and a watery coincidenceHeady days for Jessica Chastain as The Martian and Crimson Peak loom For The Martian NASAs news about water on Mars is cosmically good publicity Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Space Space Exploration Matt Damon Ridley Scott The Martian The Martian trailer Matt Damon gets down to earth about taking on The Martian role Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad83deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-martian-review-20151002-column.html,200,themartian30,themartian,latimes

Photo Credit AP / 20th Century Fox advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A lone astronaut struggles to survive on Mars. Rated PG-13 (peril language). BOTTOM LINE Youll root for Damon as a resourceful science whiz but the movies total absence of plot results in a narrative vacuum. CAST Matt Damon Jessica Chastain Chiwetel Ejiofor LENGTH 221 The most fascinating sequence in Ridley Scotts science-fiction survival epic ""The Martian"" comes when NASA astronaut Mark Watney stranded on arid Mars decides he must grow food. Using a plastic tarp a flame and a bucket of self-produced fertilizer Watney creates not just a small potato farm but enough water to sustain it. When the first green shoots emerge from the soil Watney played by an enthusiastic Matt Damon realizes he has performed a modern miracle He has made a lifeless planet habitable. Does it take anything away from Watneys fictional achievement that NASA recently announced signs of flowing water on Mars? Well yes and no. Whats fun about ""The Martian"" -- based on Andy Weirs self-published deeply researched novel -- is its ferocious dedication to scientific plausibility. Watney can solve just about any problem using math chemistry physics botany and computer science. Damon helps makes this space-based MacGyver a trustworthy figure We rarely doubt that whatever hes doing can actually be done. Any errors based on suddenly outdated information can be forgiven. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Science however is the only thing fun about ""The Martian."" Tension mounts as Watneys supplies dwindle and the weird beauty of Mars turns menacing but this movie has nothing even resembling a plot. Watneys former crewmates (Jessica Chastain Michael Pena and others) struggle with guilt over leaving him behind while NASA director Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) seems to be hiding something from his press officer (Kristen Wiig). These notes of mystery however are abandoned to make room for even more scientists (Chiwetel Ejiofor Donald Glover) who solve even more problems in order to rescue our hero. Damons Watney is a likable figure but unlike Tom Hanks Chuck Noland in ""Cast Away"" he has no inner life and nothing urgently calling him back to Earth (aside from obvious reasons like oxygen). Screenwriter Drew Goddard (""World War Z"") could have fleshed Watney out perhaps with a family a backstory a terrible secret something. Instead the character exists in -- well a vacuum. In a sense ""The Martian"" is too much fact and not enough fiction. ""Im going to science the heck out of this"" Watney announces (though he uses a stronger word than heck). That one line is essentially the entire synopsis of ""The Martian.""

When it debuted as an Oscar hopeful at Toronto others remembered ""Gravity."" And of course the parallels to Robinson Crusoe - not to mention ""Robinson Crusoe on Mars"" - were always there. But the closest film to ""The Martian"" is ""Cast Away."" And its clearest greatest theme is hope. The story is scary simple During a manned mission to Mars a sudden severe storm forces the team to abort. One astronaut is killed during the hurried blastoff; the others manage to launch. Except that one astronaut isnt really dead. Hes merely been left behind. With about two months worth of food and the next rocket due to arrive in - oh four years. There is a lot here to delight audiences of many kinds. Theres the old-fashioned Jack-London-ish story of survival. Theres the sci-fi angle - (although perhaps the only fiction here is imagining a big booming NASA program again). And theres the chance as there was in ""Cast Away"" to see an actor basically going it alone for two hours. You need a special kind of performer for that and Damon fits the bill. Yes hes an underrated actor as you know if you remember his fine work from ""The Departed"" or ""The Talented Mr. Ripley."" And hes charismatic obviously - thats a movie-star essential. But while some stars -- Tom Cruise Robert Downey Jr. - let cockiness overwhelm their charisma Damons heroes radiate simple decency. Thats essential in a film where we not only have to be intrigued by an actor basically giving a long monologue (Tom Hanks had his soccer ball to bounce it off; Damon has a video camera) but we have to worry about him. Strand a Cruise on Mars and hed build a new rocket grinning all the while; Downey would do it while aiming a string of snarky insults into outer space. Damon needs us. This movie needed him. But it also needed director Ridley Scott who both respects the outer-space genre and yet is unintimidated by it. Yes like ""Alien"" this film has a smart capable woman in Damons commander played by Jessica Chastain; yes like ""Prometheus"" theres a nasty bit of emergency self-surgery. But what Scott is going for here is quieter internalized. It still has his signature style though. Few filmmakers have the command of the frame that Scott has the eye for the precise image. He can go big with widescreen vistas of endless red deserts. He can go small down to a closeup of a tiny budding potato plant. But each shot has its proper place. His control is very occasionally less on target with the actors. Kristen Wiig plays a NASA press-relations exec but enters the film loud and sarcastic; unconsciously shes playing a movie publicist not a government one. Conversely Damon is a little too quiet at first; admirable as his stoicism is hes a little too calm a little too quickly. But in a way thats part of the film and the core of its biggest idea which is optimism. Stranded with only minimal supplies on a barren planet Damon could simply give up; arguably thats not defeatism but simple realism. And yet he gets to work. He perseveres. He keeps going. He knows that nothing will get him home again but hope. After all hope is what got us into space to begin with. Ratings note The film contains strong language brief nudity. The Martian (PG-13) Fox (141 min.) Directed by Ridley Scott. With Matt Damon Jessica Chastain. Now playing in New Jersey.    1/2 Stephen Whitty may be reached at stephenjwhittygmail.com.

The Martian (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Martian (PG-13) Matt Damon is an astronaut stranded on Mars in director Ridley Scotts brainy crowd-pleaser. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com10/1/2015 Editor rating 3 After a space mission goes wrong an astronaut is stranded on the surface of Mars and forced to seek out the essentials for life -- oxygen water food -- until help arrives. That was the premise of 1964s Robinson Crusoe on Mars except the astronaut was accompanied by a resourceful monkey. Also there were aliens. The Martian director Ridley Scotts thrilling adaptation of Andy Weirs unlikely bestseller has neither apes nor E.T.s but it shares that previous films adherence to science or at least the plausibilities of science. If an astronaut were to be left behind on the surface of Mars during a manned mission under these exact circumstances -- with a heap of life-support technology and other handy remnants of planet-roving -- then yes The Martian is sort of plausible (forget this weeks reports announcing NASAs discovery of water on the red planet because they would totally gunk up up the movies plot). Weirs novel which has legions of rabid fans even though it reads like the appendices of a fat Popular Mechanics compilation has been smoothed over and streamlined into a movie-friendly yarn by Drew Goddard (The Cabin in the Woods). Most of the fun science-fact remains intact How do you create water on a barren planet much less grow potatoes? If it requires a minimum of four years for a spacecraft to travel from Earth to Mars but the stranded astronaut Mark Watney can only remain alive for three (provided no accidents occur) how will he ever be rescued him in time? Forget wormholes and black holes; leave that stuff to Christopher Nolan and the Interstellar crowd. The Martian is about what could conceivably happen all right? Besides all matters of credibility melt away under the warm glow of Scotts grand 3D images (is there another director who knows how to use the technology better?) and Matt Damons friendly everyman demeanor. Scott has cast the movie deep Seemingly every speaking part is filled by a familiar face including Chiwetel Ejiofor as the director of the failed mission Jeff Daniels (still channeling The Newsroom) as the head of NASA Jessica Chastain as a fellow astronaut Donald Glover as a personable nerd who saves the day and Kristen Wiig as herself (OK not really but shes basically here to inject levity at random moments). Mostly though theres the charming Damon talking to himself (and us) as he sciences the s--t out of his dilemma. Scott throws in disco music and gargantuan eye candy to sell the illusion. Yes The Martian does look like it was shot on Mars even though the films tone is suspiciously light and cheerful for Scott who tends to thrive on a chillier more dour habitat. But who can bemoan this great filmmaker a crowd-pleaser? The Martian is impossible to dislike right down to its stand-up-and-cheer ABBA-soaked finale. About that science though Could an extra-thick Hefty bag really protect you from outer space? Really? Cast Matt Damon Jessica Chastain Kate Mara Michael Pena Sebastian Stan Chiwetel Ejiofor Jeff Daniels Sean Bean Donald Glover Kristen Wiig. Director Ridley Scott. Screenwriter Drew Goddard. Based on the novel by Andy Weir. A 20th Century Fox release. Running time 142 minutes. Brief vulgar language outer space peril. Playing at area theaters.

The new Ridley Scott movie is fascinating and charming and crammed and overstuffed and its a curious case too. It gets all the seemingly hard things wonderfully right but then caves in at points that should have been easy. Worst of all ""The Martian"" turns sluggish right when it needs to speed up. By the time the ending comes the only people who still care are onscreen -- and theyre just acting. The sluggish turn is especially odd because ""The Martian"" is the furthest thing from languorous at the start. A space crew is conducting experiments on Mars and after a minimum of obligatory comradely banter word arrives A storm is coming and its going to be big In this way the story kicks in about a minute into the picture and soon the crew is scrambling to return to the spaceship and take off back to Earth. Even at this stage there are hints something might be amiss but theyre minor enough to ignore. The whole sequence of the astronauts fleeing the storm is Scotts first chance to raise the audiences pulse but the scene is visually flat just generic commotion and confusion with what looks like 3-D snowflakes (or confetti) fluttering into the foreground. The extra dimension doesnt help and Scotts renowned visual sense isnt in evidence. But soon the storm lifts and the movie settles in for a good long stretch. This is when we find that the element that sounded least promising about ""The Martian"" is actually the aspect that works best. An astronaut (Matt Damon) injured and presumed dead is left behind on the planet. He wakes up and the film stays with him as he gives himself medical treatment takes stock of his food supply and tries to figure out how to survive for years until the next Mars expedition comes to town. Another kind of science fiction movie would have had Matt Damon battling space monsters and yet another kind would have him discovering intelligent life. But ""The Martian"" is a low-key film in which the astronaut is the only Martian and his struggles are simple but crucial growing food devising a water supply figuring out how to extend the life of a jeeps battery etc. Its surprising how interesting this can be especially with an actor of Damons skill and innate appeal. All suspicion that ""The Martian"" is going to be maudlin a sort of ""Cast Away"" in a space helmet is dispelled the first time the astronaut speaks into the space stations video log. In these scenes Damon is supposedly talking to himself but he is in effect talking directly to the audience and hes so engaging so without self-pity and so fixed on devising solutions to each problem he faces that we know right away that hes going to be very good company. The filmmakers -- Scott Damon and screenwriter Drew Godard (adapting Andy Weirs book) -- know something important that there is no need to treat the astronaut as a philosophical proposition or to emphasize the existential torments of loneliness on a deserted planet. The situation takes care of that part on its own. Much better to show him taking the powdered waste in the latrine and reconstituting it with water so as to make manure for his plantings. So long as the film stays with Damon its fine and when it broadens out to include NASA it maintains its sure footing for as long as the action is about the astronaut and his problems. But when it becomes a movie about crusty-but-caring government bureaucrats and weird-but-cuddly scientists and a merry-but-devoted space crew (led by a stern Jessica Chastain) it becomes worse than typical. It becomes typical as rendered by a major director which means self-important. By the finish the science discussions have become impenetrable the musical sequences are coming fast and furious and every bit of action that should take five minutes takes 15. For the record its easy to identify the precise moment that ""The Martian"" shifts from quirky originality to bloated cliche. Its when we get a landscape shot of the Martian red sands as the soundtrack intermingles the usual Soaring Strings of Hope with the ever-popular Horns of Humane Triumph. Look out for those horns. At that point its time to step out for popcorn -- or just go home. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicle staff writer. E-mail mlasallesfchronicle.com.

The Martian is a science fiction popcorn movie that is destined to be a genuine crowd pleaser. You can write the plot on the head of a pin. When a storm hits outer space the crew of Sol 19 a space mission to Mars commanded by Jessica Chastain is ordered to emergency-evacuate the planet leaving astronaut botanist and mechanical engineer Matt Damon behind. Declared dead by NASA he is stranded 140 million miles from home to face the unknown challenges that await him while he waits to be rescued. THE MARTIAN  (3/4 stars) Written by Drew Goddard Directed by Ridley Scott Starring Matt Damon Jessica Chastain and Kristen Wiig Running time 141 min. This all happens in the first 10 minutes. The next two hours chronicle the ingenious ways he manages to stay alive using his unique skills to make water fertilize a new food store and keep from freezing to death. He also has to battle depression and fear and fight going insane from the disco music left behind on the spacecraft. Based on the novel by Andy Weir theres a lot of talk in Drew Goddards screenplay about airlocks proximity radars and aeronautic science we heard in Gravity as well as the same floating stars and shooting comets in Ridley Scotts direction that we saw three years ago in Prometheus. But the appealing thing here is the unquenchable spirit of the stranded astronaut his horrified crew on the mothership Hermes after discovering their comrade is still alive and the scientists administrators inventors and assorted space nerds in Houston who rack their brains to bring him home. Theres not a lot of suspense because hes the most brilliant astronaut alive so we know hes going to survive. The fascination comes from watching everyone test the limits of the space program to beat the odds. The way Mr. Damon figures out a way to re-establish communications with NASA how China heroically compromises its own space program to offer assistance how an aerodynamics geek comes up with a plan of his own to send the five-man crew of the Hermes to intercept Sol 19 in an unprecedented meeting in mid-galaxy while millions gather to watch in Beijing Texas and Times Square--these are some of the strategies guaranteed to keep your attention from straying. The stellar cast includes Kristen Wiig Chiwetel Ejiofor Sean Bean and Jeff Daniels. The camera draws the viewer into the action transforming us into participants instead of passive voyagers. A lot of the information in The Martian will be incomprehensible to the lay audience and the climax is...well not exactly original. But it makes for one hell of an entertaining ride.

Did I mention relentless? Hes like The Terminator with a sense of humor.Most people couldnt spend extended time in a fully-equipped mall on Earth without blowing a brain gasket. How Watney spends so much time alone -- 50 million miles away in an environment that seemingly wants to kill him -- without going insane is incredible to contemplate. And thats without factoring in his Bear Grylls lifeskills and Carl Sagan knowledge. Matt Damon as astronaut Mark Watney in The Martian. (Aidan Monaghan/Twentieth Century Fox) ( Aidan Monaghan/Twentieth Century ) Thats why we go to movies -- to consider the impossible and Damon sells it packing the best of humanity into one astronaut with the survival sense of a cockroach. But at times hes almost too good. You almost want him to experience more setbacks to prove hes human. Same goes for the people who work around the clock to bring him home. Yes there are mishaps and obstacles along the way but not enough to keep you from shaking your head at the ending.Watney is part of a team of astronauts exploring Mars. When a sudden storm descends (this is where the 3D glasses come in handy) our heroes abandon their small temporary settlement. Forced to leave Watney behind the team -- led by Melissa Lewis (the typically great Jessica Chastain) -- heads back to Earth not realizing hes alive. While NASA director Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) tells the world it lost a hero Watney is just starting to ramp up the real heroism millions of miles away.Advertisement After an impressive bit of minor self-surgery Watney lays out the dilemma in a series of video log entries. He has 30 days of supplies no way to contact Earth and is marooned on a planet where things dont grow. The next NASA mission to Mars is four years away.No problem. As long as theres enough duct tape and one-liners nothing is impossible. Watney tackles overwhelming odds in multiple scenes that recall the square-peg-in-a-round-hole air filter scenario in ""Apollo 13."" He does so with genuine humor and astounding problem-solving skills (math and science teachers might require students to see this). Once he ingeniously figures out how to contact Mission Control the race is on to figure out how to get him back without creating a public-relations nightmare. Kristen Wiig is wasted as NASAs PR person and Chiwetel Ejiofor and Sean Bean are OK as decision-makers on the ground. But I kept waiting for someone to command the room like Ed Harris in ""Apollo 13"" or Scott Beach in ""The Right Stuff.""No matter the good stuff is in outer space. Very few directors blend sound or lack thereof with scenery like Ridley Scott who superbly conceptualized Drew Goddards script (adapted from Andy Weirs best-selling novel). The director of ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"" does a great job playing up the difference between the chaos on Earth and gorgeous long shots of the silent Martian landscape. Of course he also included a montage of Watneys activities backed by a recording of 70s disco music left behind that he loves to hate. Its sort of misplaced but Scott was clearly trying to keep some light humanity in a film that couldve buried itself in technology.Once the big brains on Earth decide a course of action the climactic rescue is attempted. Up to this point the films unbelievability is charming. By the end ""The Martian"" gets pretty ridiculous but not so much that it ruins the rest of the voyage.

In both novel and movie American astronaut Mark Watney is stranded on Mars when his fellow crew members leave him for dead after a ferocious dust storm. He comes to alone on a planet indifferent to his existence and presumes hes simply going to die. But he doesnt Even on a dust-dry rock Watney figures out how to make water; using his own excrement for manure he succeeds in conjuring an indoor potato field jump-started by spuds that had been sent into space with the crew as a treat for their Thanksgiving dinner. And because hes a scientist -- a botanist -- he keeps a log of his experiences one thats both specific in its technical detail and cheerfully colloquial. His interior monologues have a ""Hey I might end up dead"" esprit.Weirs novel heavy on science patter is all about problem-solving; cozy American ingenuity burns brightly in its heart. Watney even finds a way to communicate with NASA types back on Earth who race the calendar to keep him alive until they can get him back home. It takes a long time to get supplies to Mars let alone send up a rescue crew and that little potato crop cant last forever. For those longing for realism in their science fiction movies -- whatever realism means in that context -- Scotts 3-D adaptation of The Martian may be just the thing. Everything in it is reasonable. Even if you dont know much about the scientific principles involved -- I certainly didnt -- by the end youll feel pretty confident that if you should ever find yourself stuck on Mars youd know how to save yourself using spare space gear and wood shavings from a small crucifix. Youd also feel secure in the knowledge that some brainiac back on Earth could bring you back using a combination of physics geometry and the finest slingshot technology available. The Martian is only partly a story about a man in peril; its mostly a story about men (and a few women) taking control of the uncontrollable. Its confident swaggering sci-fi not the despairing kind.That may be why as elaborate and expensive-looking as The Martian is its almost totally lacking in poetry. This is an overwhelming picture oversize in its scope and ambition especially when viewed in 3-D Itll wow you with shots of jumbo metal space gears churning around and lots of people floating -- just because in space you can. The actors are treated as accessories and there are plenty of them On Earth at NASA headquarters stalwart Chiwetel Ejiofor is the chief scientist fighting to get Watney home though even he is lost in the movies grinding machinery. Jeff Daniels is the head of NASA who also wants Watney back on Earth soil as long as it doesnt mess up his bureaucratic hair too much. Kristen Wiig -- a brilliant comedienne who doesnt need to be a ""serious"" actress and who should perhaps stop trying -- struts around NASA headquarters in stiff little professional dresses looking glumly anxious over what kind of spin to put on this lost-astronaut story. Her character the resident PR honcho looks as if all the spirit has been crushed out of her.Whatever The Martians problems are Damon is the best thing in it.Meanwhile out there in space the crew of that original mission -- among them Michael Pena Kate Mara and the captain a boringly dutiful Jessica Chastain -- are hunkered down in their ship and headed back to Earth after leaving poor Matt Damon seemingly skewered to death by a communications antenna (oh the irony) on the Red Planet. Damons Watney is the only one worth feeling anything for and whatever The Martians problems may be Damon is undoubtedly the best thing in it. Even in middle age he looks boyishly vulnerable especially when seen in that tight-fitting skullcap astronauts wear beneath their helmets kind of like the ones Baby Jesus wears in Flemish paintings. How the hell is his Watney going to hold it together on Mars armed only with those potatoes for nourishment and a clutch of disco tracks for entertainment? (The latter have been left behind by Chastains captain and theyre a running gag -- Watney hates disco.) But Damon looks like the kind of boy who could fix your bike chain in a jiffy. Sure he can survive Its fun watching him figure out how to plant his garden -- with some clever editing Scott speeds up the process of waiting for the sprouts -- or find 1001 uses for a plastic tarp. (There are a lot of tarps in The Martian.)Scott orchestrates all of this like a pro. Two of his last three movies (Exodus Gods and Kings and Prometheus) were so grand in scale that making this one probably wasnt a leap. Hes workmanlike in his approach to science which always trumps magic in The Martian -- thats the point. But if we cant feel a sense of wonder at the magnitude and mystery of space why even bother? In 3-D at least The Martian is handsome only in a perfunctory way As with so many 3-D movies -- Hugo and Gravity are exceptions -- its hues look somewhat anemic and drained. (Stills from the film look brighter and richer suggesting it might be best viewed in 2-D.) Even Marss craggy landscape is less than vivid. Portions of the film were shot in Wadi Rum in Jordan but cinematographer Dariusz Wolski fails to make this desert landscape look otherworldly -- the Death Valley of so many B westerns looks more mysterious and threatening.Or flipping to a more recent reference what about the satiny red sandscape of Brian De Palmas 2000 Mission to Mars a half-dreamy half-plausible effect achieved in part by cinematographer Stephen Burums use of light reflectors made of copper sheeting? If I have to be stuck on Mars for any length of time thats the one I want. The most affecting sequence in The Martian comes late after Damons Watney has been stranded on this dangerously semi-hospitable planet for such a very long time His previously robust frame is bony. His face -- that of a man who even in his mid-forties looks barely old enough to shave -- has sprouted a rangy mountain-man beard. Watney has refashioned himself as a space pirate. Finally hes gone potty but only just a little -- hell spring back to normal soon enough.But for a few moments hes a spiritual twin to Don Cheadle in Mission to Mars another left-behind astronaut who managed to make stuff grow. By the time Cheadles friends and colleagues finally rescue him he has become the prisoner of a greenhouse that has also saved his life -- its enemy and sustenance at once. And even though he like Watney regains his sanity theres a glimmer of madness in his eyes that will never fully dissipate. Mission to Mars was derided on its release but there are few movies about space exploration as visually resplendent or as delicately perched between mournfulness and optimism. And have we really reached the point where advanced special effects count for more than visual imagination? De Palma himself a high school science fair winner approached space as a mystery a problem beautiful in its vast unsolvability. Scott all about solutions gives us the most seemingly authentic Mars money can buy. That doesnt make it the best.The Martian Directed by Ridley Scott 20th Century Fox Opens October 2 Directed by Ridley Scott. Written by Drew Goddard. Based on the novel by Andy Weir.

"Review Damon charms as stranded astronaut in The Martian | The Big Story Skip to main content Latest News The Conversation Review Damon charms as stranded astronaut in The Martian By SANDY COHEN Sep. 28 2015 328 PM EDT Without Matt Damon the solitary fight for survival on Mars would be lonely indeed. Alone on screen for most of his scenes as an astronaut stranded on the red planet the Oscar-nominated actor is the winning heart of Ridley Scotts epic space adventure ""The Martian.""With Damons charm center stage Scott has crafted an exciting hopeful story about humanity at its best The brightest minds working together for a common goal that bridges international borders and forges a feeling of unity.Affable and intelligent playful and determined Damons Mark Watney is so endearing and entertaining as a narrator and subject its easy to see why the world would want to save him.The story begins with Watney accidentally left behind during a NASA mission to Mars. When a fierce storm forces an emergency evacuation from the planet he disappears in the chaos and is presumed dead. He isnt of course and as his fellow astronauts mourn him during their months-long journey back to Earth and NASA officials struggle with how to explain his death to the public Watney wakes up injured and alone.But hes incredibly optimistic and resilient. He fixes his wound with minor surgery and immediately goes about prolonging his survival knowing it could be years before a manned spacecraft returns to Mars. He puts his skills as a botanist and engineer to work devising a way to grow crops in the arid soil and make water by burning hydrogen. He rewires old equipment from a past Mars mission in hopes of communicating with NASA.Watney is curious and talkative keeping himself company by narrating his every move. He tracks his obstacles and progress in daily video logs. He chats to himself in footage from the helmet cam in his spacesuit cracking jokes he knows no one can hear.Seeing his efforts through various camera perspectives -- the helmet cam a bunk cam inside his sleeping quarters a dashboard camera inside his space rover and the video diaries where he appears to talk directly to the audience -- adds visual interest though Damon would probably be just as magnetic talking to a hand-held camera in an empty room.Meanwhile NASA director Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels at his most clinical) and Mars mission chief Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) learn through satellite photos that Watney is alive. As NASA spokeswoman Annie Montrose (a miscast Kristin Wiig) scrambles to protect the agencys public image the men strategize how to bring the stranded astronaut home.""The Martian"" unfolds in three settings all spectacularly realized by production designer Arthur Max. Theres life on Earth set inside NASAs sterile Houston headquarters and the lively Jet Propulsion Laboratory; and life on Mars a dusty red rocky expanse where nothing lives (which filmmakers actually found in Jordan). Then theres life aboard the films elegant spacecraft from the rugged rover Watney uses to explore Mars to the Enterprise-inspired ship that carries his fellow crewmembers and their commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain).Unlike other recent big-screen space trips the science here is presented simply enough that no suspension of disbelief or quantum leap through the time-space continuum is necessary. It all seems plausible and author Andy Weir upon whose novel the film is based insists it is calling it ""a technical book for technical people.""""I had no idea mainstream readers would be interested at all"" he said.With Scott at the helm and Damon leading the cast ""The Martian"" is accessible and beautiful cinematically and intellectually. Even though its a big Hollywood production Watneys survival really does seem in question and audiences will want to join the international crowds on screen in cheering for his rescue.""The Martian"" a 20th Century Fox release is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""some strong language injury images and brief nudity.""

Somewhere along the way the promise of that great big beautiful tomorrow went away while science itself became suspect among recalcitrant politicians who couldnt publicly commit to believing in the theory of evolution or the destruction of the ozone layer lest they lose points among certain anti-intellectual segments of their base. Superheroics are the prevailing dream being peddled by todays movies but there are limits to the aspirations they inspire we can hope to be as brave as Batman or as resourceful as Iron Man but none of us are ever going to become Asgardian deities or flying Kryptonians or talking trees. See Video The Martian Trailer Matt Damon Struggles to Survive While Stranded on the Red Planet All of which brings me to ""The Martian"" one of the most exciting film-going experiences Ive had all year. Its a movie that believes in humanitys capacity to travel the universe but it also cheerleads for the scientific know-how required to build a rocket or to calculate a trajectory or even to grow crops using astronaut poop. Its a film that believes in peoples better instincts and the potential for our ability to create an exceptional future. (""Tomorrowland"" tried to accomplish something similar with less success.) Perhaps most importantly not only does the film stress the importance of using math and physics and botany and chemistry to solve problems but it also makes a plot based on scientific inquiry and audacity just as exciting and even more unpredictable as the movies usual brand of problem-solving the kind that involves punching everyone and then blowing everything up. And coming on the heels of ""Exodus Gods and Kings"" -- draw your own conclusions about ""Prometheus"" or even ""The Counselor"" -- ""The Martian"" reinforces Ridley Scotts place as an accomplished storyteller one who can focus on human-sized characters even against a backdrop as big as the Milky Way. Matt Damon stars as Mark Watney part of a team of astronauts on a manned mission to Mars. His team is forced off the planet by a sudden windstorm during which a detached satellite dish knocks out Watneys radio and drags him out of the others sight. Determining that he must be dead Commander Lewis (Jessica Chastain) reluctantly decides to leave him behind in order to save the other crew members. Watney it is no spoiler to say is not dead. Staggering back to the crews temporary compound he must remove a chunk of antenna lodged in his sternum (good news for those who liked the self-surgery scene in ""Prometheus"") before listing out all the reasons hes doomed he could run out of food or water he could run out of oxygen his quarters could depressurize. Once hes established what could kill him Watney then begins to ""science the shit out of"" that list devising ways to grow crops create water from scratch and possibly even travel to a spot where the next Martian explorers are set to land in the next year or so. Lucky for him NASA notices that somethings been moving the rovers and adjusting the buildings and once people back on Earth - including scientist Chiwitel Ejiofor administrator Jeff Daniels and flack Kristen Wiig - realize Watneys alive they go into overdrive first re-establishing communication and then figuring out just how they might rescue him. See Video Matt Damon Isnt Anti-Gay Hes Just Old Wrap Trends Adapting the novel by Andy Weir Drew Goddard (""Cabin in the Woods"" Netflixs ""Daredevil"") very skillfully juggles suspense -- you may feel you know how this movie ends but the steps it takes to get there will come as a surprise -- and humor; Watney records a video log long before he has a chance to talk to anyone back on Earth and his sardonic good humor goes a long way in keeping both his spirits and the movie afloat. (Kudos to supervising music editor Tony Lewis and his team who must have had a blast selecting the very specific genre songs that Commander Lewis left behind on Mars much to Watneys consternation.) The results are less like ""Gravity"" -- even though that films successful melding of prestige-picture awards baiting and large-format ticket prices paved the way for this one as well as for ""Everest"" and ""The Walk"" -- and more like ""Apollo 13"" in which a seemingly insurmountable series of catastrophes is broken down into a set of discrete problems each of which ultimately has a solution. (""The Martian"" may or may not boost science in the eyes of todays schoolchildren but it definitely makes Jet Propulsion Labs seems like a really sexy place for smart wonks to work.) Also Read Matt Damons The Martian Latest Movie to Challenge the Curse of Red Planet This ranks among Damons finest work allowing him to be both puckish and brainy amidst his travails but the film is by no means a one-hander -- Goddard and Scott surround him with fascinating support teams whether its the folks at NASA or JPL or even Watneys fellow Mars explorers (played by Chastain Kate Mara Michael Pena Sebastian Stan and Askel Hennie) who remain crucial throughout. ""The Martian"" is thrilling and amusing from start to finish -- and it made my inner Weekly Reader subscriber dream anew about those cities on the moon. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

""No"" he emphatically declares as one familiar up-tempo 70s song whirls in the background. ""I will not turn the beat around"" PHOTOS Summer movie hunks Its an amusing line. But the most incredible part about it is that hes alone and talking directly to a camera. On Mars. Yup The Martian -- which premiered Sept. 11 at the Toronto International Film Festival -- is that kind of picture. Both surreally funny and a 3D visual stunner this first-rate film is one of the best of the year. Damon plays Mark Watley an astronaut and part of a team of NASA crew members sent to explore the red planet. But after only a few weeks on the premises a severe storm hits and the mission is quickly aborted. Mark is struck by debris and left for dead as his commander (Jessica Chastain) and the team hightail it back into outer space. PHOTOS Matt and Ben Afflecks bromance Just one tiny glitch Mark is alive and well. Fine ""well"" is a relative term. He just stapled his bleeding stomach closed. Hes got limited food and water rations on the space station (called a ""hab"") on a dry dusty planet incapable of vegetation. His oxygen is limited. Hes unable to communicate with anyone. And most damning of all all he has for musical entertainment is Chastains lousy disco music collection. Any other person would crumble under the circumstances. Not this guy. Damon in true movie star mode brings a self-assured confidence to the role. Using a video camera in the station he v-logs his every move and thought. (Think of the camera as his ""Wilson."") Never once does he panic. Instead as he tells us hes going to ""science the s--t"" out of his circumstances. To quote another disco classic he will survive. His ideas are nothing short of ingenious. A skilled botanist he uses poop to fertilize and grow a potato garden. He combines hydrogen and oxygen to make water. (For kindle he takes apart one crew members wooden cross.) And soon enough -- yes -- hes able to communicate to NASA via a computer server. MacGyver himself would be astounded. Through it all he maintains a wry if exasperated sense of humor. Mark may be smarter than all of us but theres something about Damons performance that makes him an empathetic everyman. The cast of The Martian. Courtesy of 20th Century Fox PHOTOS Stars whove lost or gained weight for roles The loose tone extends across the galaxy too. Back in Houston NASA has a problem (couldnt resist). How in the world can they explain to the public that this astronaut is alive -- and then work to get him back home? In a refreshing twist there isnt a single scene in which someone gives an overwrought speech or a room full of men breathlessly speak in a mythologized language. No way. Not with Kristen Wiig() playing NASAs cynical media director. She along with the agencys director (Jeff Daniels) and Mars specialist (Chiwetel Ejiofor) are wary tactical shrewd and still playful. After the group finally figures out a risky rescue plan Ejiofor hilariously attempts to decipher Marks reaction. Even in the pressure of the moment he muses if the reply of ""are you f--ing kidding me?"" is one of excitement or dread. With all this snappy fun its easy to forget that this is still a heavy-duty sci-fi film. Indeed space master Ridley Scott -- whose credits include Alien Gladiator and Prometheus -- directs with effortless aplomb. The orange-red vistas of Mars look rich and textured while the climactic sequence in space is a nail-biting thrill. Remarkably hes able to smoothly shift the action between Damon on that planet Chastain and the crew in orbit and the brain trust in Houston without ever losing the films exhilarating pulse. (And unlike Prometheus hes not saddled with an incomprehensible script either.) This is his best work in eons; same for his unfettered leading man. As for the disco music?

Thankfully I have more room than that. And Im glad I do because Scotts sci-fi adventure is the kind of film you leave the theater itching to tell your friends to see. Like Apollo 13 and Gravity it turns science and problem solving into an edge-of-your-seat experience. The problem that needs solving is this The crew of NASAs Ares III mission is collecting samples on the Red Planet when a violent sandstorm whips up. In all of the zero-visibility chaos Damons Mark Watney is presumed to be dead. So his team (led by Jessica Chastain) evacuates and irreversibly heads back to Earth. But Watney isnt dead hes merely a bit roughed up and now hes stranded 140 million miles from home. Watneys team left behind only enough provisions to last a few months. Which sounds like a long time until were told by NASA officials (Jeff Daniels and Chiwetel Ejiofor) that it will take four years before a rescue party can reach him. Watney may be alive but hes living with a death sentence unless he can figure out a way to use his wits and turn the lifeless planet into a makeshift Eden with water and food. Fortunately hes a botanist. ""Im going to have to science the s-- out of this"" he says. Thereve been a lot of movies about Mars. And there have been a lot of movies about lone castaways (see sidebar). There was even one that combined the two 1964s Robinson Crusoe on Mars. But The Martian based on Andy Weirs best-selling novel and Drew Goddards airtight script is the first to make you feel what its like to be stranded there thanks to both Scotts 3-D visual grandeur (this is after all the man behind Alien and Blade Runner) and his charismatic Crusoe Damon. Watney keeps a video diary to track his Mr. Wizard experiments and to hold on to his sanity--its his high-tech version of Wilson the volleyball. Damon sells these confessional monologues about thermodynamics hexadecimals and even Donna Summer in a way few actors could. Hes equally at home peddling pathos and punchlines. And he single-handedly turns an epic survival tale into something intimate and human. The Martian isnt perfect. There are too many secondary characters (Kristen Wiig as a NASA functionary just stands around looking concerned and Donald Glovers Aspergian physicist is like an annoying rejected cast member from The Big Bang Theory) and Scotts ending is disappointingly corny considering how uncorny everything leading up to it is. But it seems churlish to point out a few flaws in a film thats such a thrilling testament to human ingenuity. Its a rare blockbuster with the brains to match its budget.

Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Matt Damon in The Martian. Twentieth Century Fox ID 6884370 Of all the stanning Hollywood has been doing for NASA in the last few years from Gravity to Interstellar to Tomorrowland The Martian is by many kilometers the nerdiest.And thats also the reason its the best.Forget all those themes of rebirth and manifest destiny and utopia and the occasional weird undercurrent of restoring American greatness -- The Martian is about science and it is about math things those other movies handwaved their way past in order to get to the flashier parts about bravery and the human spirit. Mark Watney (Matt Damon at his most unassumingly lovable) the astronaut who gets stranded on Mars and left for dead in the opening sequence of The Martian has plenty of bravery and spirit but thats not the point of his story. He decides he wants to live that hes going to live and after that the focus is on how he goes about doing that on an inhospitable planet years from rescue.The Martian directed by the unpredictable Ridley Scott is an exciting and sometimes very funny movie thats stirringly confident that something like the growing of crops and the extending of battery life can be suspenseful and dramatic when theyre happening on Mars and are a matter of life and death. View this image > Peter Mountain / Twentieth Century Fox ID 6884410 The film based on Andy Weirs web serial turned best-selling novel of the same name and adapted to screen by The Cabin in the Woods Drew Goddard is technically science fiction in the sense that it involves technology more advanced than our own and in that its literally fiction about science. But its characters and its world feel otherwise comfortably contemporary. Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) the head of NASA deals with issues of funding and media coverage. Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) the commander of the Ares 3 mission has a love of disco music that provides the movie with an amusing throwback soundtrack.And Mark? Mark is a dork who when asked for a photo for PR rep Annie Rose (Kristen Wiig) strikes a Fonz pose and who says things like ""Mars will come to fear my botany powers"" But that irrepressibility in the face of terrible odds becomes the kind of thing that can squeeze a few tears out of you. Instead of spiraling into despair Mark sometimes through visible force of will fondly mocks his fellow crewmembers choice of retro games (Zork II) and explains his problem-solving process in not always graspable detail into a video log that no one might ever see his version of Cast Aways Wilson. View this image > Twentieth Century Fox ID 6884432 But unlike Tom Hankss Chuck Noland Mark is never really alone. He gets in communication with NASA and a group of people on the ground and in space that include Michael Pena Sean Bean Kate Mara Sebastian Stan Aksel Hennie Chiwetel Ejiofor Donald Glover Benedict Wong and Mackenzie Davis. The multi-pronged rescue attempt reveals The Martian to be a wide-reaching ensemble film.The Martian doesnt invent an antagonist -- space is more than enough of one. And it doesnt fill time with screenwriterly cul-de-sacs in which there are misunderstandings and miscommunications. Mark understands immediately why he was left behind and accepts it just as Vincent Kapoor (Ejiofor) quickly figures out what Mark is up to when he heads away from the habitat in which hes been living toward another area of the planet. The narrative efficiency of these choices serves as a nice underlining of the characters intelligence which is demonstrated in actions instead of accessories or vocabulary. A scene in which characters take a vote on a big decision is thoughtful and emotional while also being so free of the expected bickering that its practically an applause moment.The Martian is a sprawling international adventure with some thrilling space sequences and some windows in which wonder is allowed to filter through but its satisfactions are really those of a workplace drama. Its ultimately about people who are great at and who love their jobs love them enough to risk death and to feel lucky to have had the chance even in the face of those odds. For a movie that avoids the grandstanding of something like Interstellar in which Damon and Chastain also starred The Martian turns out to be almost shockingly poignant in its affirmation not of a lone great man but of what can be done when capable people work together one step at a time.

Photo Courtesy of TIFF/Twentieth Century Fox via AP An unpretentious popcorn classic that builds to a white-knuckle climax the nerd-driven space opera ""The Martian is the best thing that either Matt Damon and director Ridley Scott have done in years. For his third trip into space (after ""Elysium and his ""surprise unbilled supporting role in ""Interstellar) Damon spends around 75 percent of the two-hour-plus film on screen alone. Hes an American astronaut whos left behind for dead by his crew mates after they begin the long journey back to Earth following a storm that forces them to abort their mission. Damon whos been impaled by an antenna eventually regains consciousness. Taking care of his injury in the well-equipped base is relatively easy. The hard part is stretching his limited food supply until the scheduled arrival of a Mars lander four years in the future since he has no way of communicating to Earth that hes still alive. Fortunately Damon is a botanist and a very ingenious one at that managing to create a greenhouse and generate extra water to water his crop of potatoes. He eventually figures out a way to re-establish contact with Earth using the primitive technology of a 1996 Mars probe (the film takes place in the not-too-distant future). A bit before this his colleagues at NASA have already figured out that Damon who has already been given a heros funeral is still alive based on satellite images. This causes them a number of dilemmas Do they tell his crew mates who are still en route to earth but lacking the sufficient supplies to turn around and rescue him? Can they mount a rescue mission to save Damons life -- and if so at what risk to other astronauts? There is much debate between the conservative image-conscious NASA director (Jeff Daniels) and the more gung-ho head of NASAs Mars missions (Chiwetel Ejiofor). While all this is going on Damon is figuring out ingenious solutions to all sort of problems until Murphys Law kicks in and he literally has to resort to a plastic tarp and duct tape to keep going. Damons performance (long stretches of it without dialogue) grounds all these science-nerd goings-on with much more humor than youd ever expect from Scott the director of ""Alien and ""Prometheus who has delivered yet another great-looking movie here but has rarely been known for his light touch. A highly complicated and extremely risky rescue mission involving a top-secret Chinese missile and Damons fellow crew members (including Kate Mara and Michael Pena) develops. Lets just say that Jessica Chastain who is barely in the first two-thirds of movie as the mission commander heroically justifies her second billing. Kristen Wiig who plays NASAs very busy director of public relations is mostly called on to provide comic relief. Derived from a novel by Andy Weir ""The Martian is a straightforward and thrilling survival-and-rescue adventure without the metaphysical and emotional trappings of ""Interstellar. Awards prospects seem minimal outside the technical categories but that probably wont bother Fox since the studio has a brainy-but-fun film that could achieve the trajectory for something like the 675-million worldwide gross achieved by ""Interstellar.

Daily Edition Login to download The Martian TIFF Review 152 PM PDT 9/11/2015 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS Ridley back in (a good) space. TWITTER Ridley Scott adapts Andy Weirs sci-fi novel about an astronaut played by Matt Damon left stranded and struggling to survive on Mars. Ridley Scott goes back to the future a familiar destination for him and returns in fine shape in The Martian. Although technically science fiction by virtue of its being largely set on a neighboring planet this smartly made adaptation of Andy Weirs best-selling novel is more realistic in its attention to detail than many films set in the present giving the story the feel of an adventure that could happen the day after tomorrow.  Constantly absorbing rather than outright exciting this major autumn Fox release should generate muscular business worldwide. Scott has famously been up in space before thrillingly in Alien far less so in Prometheus (a sequel to which he is currently preparing). This time hes telling a survival story pure and simple of an American astronaut thought to be dead whos left behind on Mars when an enormous storm compels his five fellow crew members to hastily cut short their extra-planetary visit.  Its Robinson Crusoe on Mars but without the monkey and aliens. When Mark Watney (Matt Damon) regains consciousness after having been impaled by an errant antenna and knocked out he quickly assesses the situation Hes millions of miles from home and based on the food supply concludes that hes got a month to live. But hes by nature a can-do optimistic kind of guy a botanist by profession possessed of a sardonic self-deprecating sense of humor and decides that he has no intention of dying even though the next Mars mission from home isnt due to arrive for another four years. See more The Scene at TIFF 2015 (Photos) Most of the early-going is devoted to the man making calculations as to how he can maximize his time on the arid planet beginning by growing more potatoes from the ones hes got (in part by using his own homemade manure). Living in the relatively spacious quarters he and his colleagues set up Mark cannibalizes everything he can carefully apportions his rations and settles in for the long term; at moments the biggest threat to his sanity is the exclusive collection of 70s disco music left behind by one of his former astronauts. The claustrophobia and solitariness of Marks situation is shortly broken up by events back on Earth. After Marks tragedy has been duly mourned by the public a sharp-eyed NASA technician notices ground movement in her surveillance of the Martian surface that could only be Mark moving around. Communication is duly re-established which ignites both elation at his survival and frantic assessments of what it would take and cost to launch a rescue mission. Weirs book is heavy with technical assessments of food and oxygen supplies mechanical capabilities flight duration and the physics of inter-planetary travel. Screenwriter Drew Goddard (World War Z Cloverfield) has respected all these details while whittling them down to manageable and comprehensible levels. Officials at NASA and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (represented by a lively and individualistic cast including Jeff Daniels Kristen Wiig Sean Bean Chiwetel Ejiofor Mackenzie Davis and Donald Glover) do everything they can to develop a feasible rescue plan and are ultimately helped out by a surprising foreign partner. But ultimately it comes down to the willingness of Marks astronaut colleagues (Jessica Chastain Michael Pena Kate Mara Sebastian Stan Aksel Hennie) to place themselves at great risk by attempting a long-shot rescue attempt a decision that raises the provocative moral dilemma of whether its correct to put five lives at great risk for the remote reward of saving one life. Scott does generate a degree of suspense in this climactic stretch but the films overall tone is dominated by the characters collegial humor mutual respect among professionals and smart people being tested by an unprecedented challenge. The director and screenwriter downplay the conventional melodrama inherent in the situation in favor of emphasizing how practical problems should be addressed with rational responses rather than hysteria knee-jerk patriotism or selfish expedience. Read more TIFF Michael Moore Talks ""Prankish"" New Film The result is an uncustomarily cheery and upbeat film from Scott a number of whose works range from the despairing (Thelma and Louise Black Hawk Down) to the nihilistic (Hannibal The Counselor). There is also a insinuation that the meticulous sense of resourcefulness the upbeat get-the-job-done attitude exemplified by Mark is very much akin to the directors own to the point that the optimistic lining common to both the novel and the film seems at one with the story itself and not an artificial Hollywood-induced spin. In significant measure due to his characters mordant humor which Goddard has slightly amplified from the book Damon provides comfortable company during the long stretches when hes onscreen alone and the actors physicality makes Marks capability entirely credible. The scenes back on Earth provide a hectic densely populated counterweight to the Martian aridity which is magnificently represented by exteriors shot in the vicinity of Wadi Rum in Jordan not far from where great stretches of Lawrence of Arabia were filmed. Cinematographer Dariusz Wolski turns the neat trick of providing the film with a fundamental documentary reality while also making a thing of great beauty. Extra attentiveness is amply on display in all creative departments.

With ideas like cryogenic sleep and warp speed the movies have a tendency to make space travel look easy. Not Ridley Scotts ""The Martian"" an enthralling and rigorously realistic outer-space survival story in which Matt Damon plays a NASA botanist stranded on the Red Planet after a sandstorm forces his crewmates to abort mission. Like Robinson Crusoe on Mars Damons ""right stuff"" hero has to get by on his own wits and ""science the sh-"" out of his predicament. It wont be easy but it is possible -- and thats the exhilarating thrill of both Andy Weirs speculative-fiction novel and screenwriter Drew Goddards ""science fact"" adaptation. Considering that the United States hasnt launched a manned space mission since 2011 ""The Martian"" should do far more than just make Fox a ton of money; it could conceivably rekindle interest in the space program and inspire a new generation of future astronauts. As Mark Watney Damon serves as the poster boy for these future space travelers a good-humored all-American team player whos just 18 ""sols"" (or Martian days) into his mission when he is impaled by a communications antenna and left for dead by his colleagues during a forced evacuation. Watney is the lowest-ranking member of his team and the least equipped to handle such a situation with one notable caveat As a botany specialist his assignment was to investigate whether plants could grow in an environment without fertilizer or water -- and now with only enough food to last 400 sols and the next planned mission nearly four years away Watneys ability to pull off that tall order will determine whether he lives or dies. Actually there are a thousand different real-world things that could kill him but its clear he wont survive unless he manages to ""cultivate"" Mars. Before ""Gravity"" studio executives might have thought twice before greenlighting such a big-budget space drama (surely such Mars-set disappointments as ""Red Planet"" ""John Carter"" and ""Mission to Mars"" must have given them pause) and while a good portion of ""The Martians"" audience will surely be hoping for a repeat of Sandra Bullocks white-knuckle experience Scott has a different agenda altogether. The helmer is already responsible for two of most influential sci-fi movies of all time ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"" and he has better things to do than repeat himself -- or anyone else for that matter. ""The Martian"" finds Scott and his team innovating once again this time moving in the direction of the plausible to present the most realistic version possible of a manned mission to Mars (with a few well-chosen stylistic flourishes courtesy of costume designer Janty Yates). Though the film proves reasonably suspenseful in parts Scott isnt trying to generate the same real-time intensity as ""Gravity"" (in fact ""The Martian"" takes place over nearly two years demanding an altogether different pace). Nor does he distract himself with attempting to pioneer the field of 3D filmmaking though he does incorporate the technology in effective yet nondistracting ways. At its most basic ""The Martian"" serves as an epic homage to the nerd -- a deferential widescreen celebration of human intelligence in a genre that so often hinges on speed braun or sheer midi-chlorian levels (thanks for nothing George Lucas). And while Watney may be stranded by himself on Mars hes anything but alone with the best minds on Earth working overtime to bring him home -- if only he can figure out how to communicate with the good folks at Houstons Johnson Space Center. Nothing brings the people of this planet together quite like space travel and Scott manages to alternate between the immediate Readers Digest appeal of Watneys sol-to-sol survival on Mars with the unifying impact his potential rescue has back on Earth where TV viewers follow every development and the Chinese even declassify a secret space program in order to help. With no acid-dripping extraterrestrials to menace him on Mars and no James Cameron-style greedy corporate villains ready to sacrifice him on Earth (just Jeff Daniels still in ""The Newsroom"" mode as a pragmatic NASA honcho forced to make some tough calls) ""The Martian"" feels downright well Martian compared with the vast majority of space-travel dramas. Its not without precedent however. The sleek science-friendly elegance of Arthur Maxs production design recalls ""Silent Running"" (another sci-fi parable with a botanist hero) while its running series of logistical challenges echoes Arthur C. Clarke sequel ""2010."" But instead of trying to scare people off space travel Scott and company recombine these elements in hopes of inspiring a generation for whom the moon landing and shuttle missions are now ancient history practically nostalgia while the American space program sits mothballed. While not propaganda per se the film seeks to galvanize (rather than terrorize) those who might shape the future. That was the hollow promise ""Tomorrowland"" offered this past summer featuring a feel-good epilogue in which its white heroes recruited a diverse range of talented young people around the world. But instead of waiting for that time to come ""The Martian"" puts mans potential for problem solving to to the test today assembling a gender-balanced multi-culti cast and combining their brightest ideas to save Damons character. Scott recycles some of his cast (including mission commander Jessica Chastain) from Christopher Nolans eye-crossing ""Interstellar"" in which Damon played an astronaut with far more sinister intentions and though ""The Martian"" can be even more densely geek-speak in places Goddards script manages to parse the technical jargon for lay viewers. As Michael Pena puts it ""But like in English what would that be?"" after his colleagues hit him with one of their more technical solutions. (Chastain and Pena share the return vessel with Kate Mara Aksel Hennie and Sebastian Stan while Chiwetel Ejiofor Benedict Wong Donald Glover and a half-serious Kristen Wiig brainstorm from the ground.) Weir did his research when writing the novel basing each of Watneys MacGyver-like solutions (using recycled human waste to turn Thanksgiving potatoes into a viable crop burning hydrazine rocket fuel to create water etc.) as well as their subsequent setbacks (killer Martian frost explosive chemical reactions) on scenarios that could reasonably arise on Mars. Scott carries that scrupulous adherence to science forward in the film eschewing a more predictable suspense-movie score from composer Harry Gregson-Williams in favor of the sort of mellow musical chain reaction heard in natural-science docs and Discovery Channel reality shows. The idea here is to capitalize on the excitement of human ingenuity the musical metaphor for which can be heard percolating behind the teams every breakthrough -- and they are a team. Unlike so many films that cast heroism as the doing of a single rebellious soul this one does justice to the idea that truly amazing feats depend on the collaboration of exceptional people. In ""The Martian"" we identify with Damon but he couldnt do it without the planets best behind him. Rather than giving Watney a Wilson volleyball or HAL-like supercomputer to chat with Goddard relies on another of the books ""Robinson Crusoe""-like touches (Daniel Defoes novel was written in the characters voice and fooled early readers as a faux travelogue) giving him amusing ""HAB journal"" entries -- or video diaries -- in which to document his own progress. By applying 3D to these digital recordings as well d.p. Dariusz Wolski seamlessly eases audiences between the intimate loneliness of Watneys habitat and the magisterial land- and space-scapes beyond -- no easy feat as Ray and Charles Eames ""Powers of Ten"" proved the year Scott made his directorial debut. Though Watney has already proven his resourcefulness by doctoring his own puncture wound his recordings serve the dual purpose of giving him a chance to explain complicated science ideas while endearing us to Damons naturally charismatic personality. The poor guy does his best to keep his mind active on Mars but with only a collection of disco hits and ""Happy Days"" episodes to simulate human company even the sanest astronaut would start to go a little stir-crazy -- although admittedly Gloria Gaynors ""I Will Survive"" has seldom seemed a more appropriate anthem.

This movie ""The Martian"" was nothing more than a liberal spin from the get go. The acting was bad the directing was typical the movie itself was an expected boring piece of work. No wonder why the overall media gave it +4 stars. Now if you want a truly good to see movie get ""Gravity"" instead. Reply Michel says January 13 2016 at 445 pm An very entertaining some what family friendly movie (well done to all cast amp; crew) which I feel was well worth spending the 22.26 for the DVD to add to our library. Reply Gerry Mattia says January 11 2016 at 1007 pm I am wondering how your article is sitting well with the recent Golden Globe awards of ""The Martian"" in the Comedy category - more than one award for COMEDY?"". ""At its most basic ""The Martian"" serves as an epic homage to the nerd -- a deferential widescreen celebration of human intelligence in a genre that so often hinges on speed braun or sheer midi-chlorian levels (thanks for nothing George Lucas)"" -- how did you miss slipping in Robin Williams for his nerd-Na-Nu-Nu""? I left the following on rag todayRidley Scott - How the hell can you allow ""The Martian"" to be considered a comedy at any award show? Amazing that Sci-fi has yet to be a category at The Globes. Of course Matt Damon was confused accepting the award for ""Best Actor In a COMEDY"". I read the book while on vacation and I can assure that its author is wondering what the hell happened after he signed it over to Hollywood. A series of script lines of ""How bad disco is"" does not a comedy make. Anyone who truly read the novel got a bit lost in the empirical attraction it offered. You are not Watney for allowing that banner up there and everyone should see how far you are from being rescued. Reply Mike Buck says January 7 2016 at 921 pm Loved it all scenery special effects writing screen adaptation and Matt was simply fantastic cant imagine where he went in his head to pull together such a variety of emotional tapestry? Well done should be very proud Reply Michael Maxwell says November 10 2015 at 959 am Not an original movie script or book. Just a another rewrite-twist of an original movie Robinson Crusoe on Mars from 1964. Reply Hoops says November 6 2015 at 332 pm A truly great and inspiring movie flawlessly made abd acted. Reply emmy says October 31 2015 at 1013 pm Horrible movie. Matt Damon and Jessica Chastains potentially great performances were swallowed whole by the plodding silly predictable plot of this overrated bloated film; plus too much screen time given to the ultra-wooden Jeff Daniels and the films many secondary characters who we never got to know or care about; and the crazy-bad casting of Kristen Wiig as who/what? (so distracting-like an extra jumping in for close-ups and a handful of stammering pointless lines). Finally Matt Damons body-double used for his extreme weight loss scenes only made you feel how little he was willing to actually invest in his role with the crappy-cheap effect akin to super bad lip-syncing. I cannot understand the high rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Utterly mind boggling Reply Davo says October 12 2015 at 828 am Too bad they didnt make him grey at the end a primary telltail sign of acute and chronic stress which if they were striving for a degree of realism would have happened; plus it would have made for a visual impact to be long remembered by the viewer and a topic of discussion afterwards. Reply Chris says October 9 2015 at 1002 am ""The Martian"" borrows heavily from ""Apollo 13"" except it takes place on a planet not in space. Technical and acting achievements aside I was more invested in the real-life drama of astronauts stranded in space than this fictional account. We knew from the outset that Mark Watney was going to be able to utilize the existing equipment left behind with little concerns about his seemingly unlimited sources of power. I also think Mark should have experienced more crisis moments during his wait to be rescued instead of being so unrealistically plucky throughout. Reply Leandro Arteaga Vega says October 20 2015 at 846 pm Maybe part of the training for such a long mission help him to avoid turn banana crazy. Reply AllHopeAbandon says October 3 2015 at 418 pm Great book Sad to see a libtard injected into such a role...probably will skip movie. Reply Mark Powell says October 3 2015 at 500 am Mr. Tapley and Ms. Rodman First Tapley Okay; you asked; so heres one for you If youre not even embarrassed to make such a fool of yourself you cant be helped only the shame would give you a chance for improvement. First ""Dafoe"" is not a typo any more than say ""Vice President Byden."" Its (as hello I noted) not knowing/recognizing/being able to write the name of one of the great authors. And being willing to just take a guess. Its not far above e.g. USA Todays recent citation only typical these days for that paper of happenings ""while the negotiations [no kidding not ""went""] when on."" Thats not a ""typo"" or even incompetence compounded by negligence such as Varietys; rather the drastic illiteracy that literally knows English only by colloquial sound not in writing and thus uses wholly wrong words. Varietys lesser but still ugly misspelling rates as not even grade-school journalism but clownery. In any case do you also defend a ""leading"" mag at least in the entertainment sphere leaving it uncorrected so long? Would or should say Jonathan ""Zwift"" (which could conceivably be a typo only b/c ""s"" and ""z"" are adjacent but should of course instantly be seen even in the most basic proof by a lemur) or (more of ""Dafoe""s type I think) John ""Milltin"" have likewise gone unfixed? I see ""Dafoe"" has now finally been corrected -- because of my supposedly offensive notice which clearly was needed as an ill body needs its medicine. (And you whine that it tastes bad.) Anyway by defending that as a ""typo"" and abusing that needed term for a whole universe of minor errors that might not rate as incompetence rather ""just"" negligence you lose any credibility you mightve had... had you not made your other foolish remarks re/ sols and how much sustenance with which Mark/Matt faces his challenge Again note -- since you either mendaciously pretend to ignore the key point or are too dim to grasp it -- that I noted not seeing the film rather simply reading and comparing a few reviews. Ive also not seen the book which might well say 400 sols (which would make a more realistic challenge viz. extending his supply by a factor of ca. 3.6-3.7 to roughly four Earth years than multiplying a months worth to four years). The other reviews Ive seen including outlets more respected than Variety if touching the matter explicitly at all say he has a month or 30 or 31 days. The (hello) character himself says 31 in a clip Ive seen. All these references -- absent any other reader/viewer exposure/familiarity with the product -- clearly imply nay state the supply (food and/or water) applies to Watney alone not to (?) what was to sustain the whole crew. (If the last wouldnt he say such as ""I have a months supply for [X] people""? And how many were in the landing anyway? Last I checked 31 goes into 400 just about 13 times. But I get the impression (again from reviews/clips/cast listing) the landing involved just a few people. So any rational reader/clip-viewer seeing Varietys ""400"" would flag it at least as suspiciously at odds with others. So Kris why are you so desperate to defend the indefensible rather than accept the obvious? Paid stooge? Just partial to Variety? And/or just dim? Whatever yours is obviously a more wretched ""angry little world"" attacking correction rather than error than mine doing the reverse in dismay disdain and wish for better (and by my choice to date almost never expressed publicly as here; most of the many thousands of top-outlet cases Ive filed are more egregious than all this). I just want to see standards raised to within a few parsecs of what should be grade-school journalism and/or academe. The Problem is not too-mordant error-notices but the ubiquity of such as say (just in recent space-exploration news) Pluto-probe program chiefs including the chief so incompetent they say on NPR BBC and elsewhere such as that radio signals to and from Pluto take months ( rather than a few or several hours) and that the probe left Earth with 10 times the moonbound Apollo crafts escape velocity (actually from what I read ca. 1.4 times; weve never flown anything at anywhere near a quarter-million mph). Or also from NPR and just this week -- and much more typical of my files of many thousands of entries -- Detroit-""expert"" Pulitzer-winner and Washington Postie David Maraniss saying ""many hundreds of people"" died in Detroits 1943 riot. (The universally reported figure is 34.). As ever of course with no correction from ""erudite"" hosts. Too embarrassing. People might say such as ""Gee if this expert doesnt know that and says whatever he feels like and nobody corrects all while bosses say such errors arent made and are corrected whenever they are made... Maybe the whole journo-academic landscape is full of samp;. And that and the prevasive persistent intimidation and harassment of any even intimating let alone attempting whistleblowing are The Problems."" So understand just a little better now clown given my munificent patient gentleness with you here in this little entertainment-mag example on which I decided to post a flag? Earth to Kris Major fundamental factual errors especially of history geography science and math are ubiquitous due to rampant unmolested incompetence and utter individual and institutional psychopathy IRT any notice of any error. Thats Reality. You seem the type -- most common among the semiliterate and unethical -- to excuse it all; say the above examples; as ""just verbal typos; just misspeaking."" Youd make a good pol or flack for a pol by prevailing standards. ++++++++++++ Ms. Rodman Likewise you too only make a fool of yourself in your case by (like apparently in a different way [re/ ""400""] the review) not even paying basic attention in your case even to whom you address You aimed to answer/rebuke me but addressed yourself to Tapley. Hard to take seriously anything after such as start. At least you though uh ""give me"" ""Dafoe"" without calling it a ""typo."" I dont need you to ""give me"" anything. Id like to see other readers say/post something when say... just e.g. from the files and off the top of my head as a (here Kris; enjoy) howler in both stupefying error and stupefying lack of public ID of it; and not even unusual for CNN CNNs 2013 story on the Chelyabinsk-area meteor (the second such event in Russia in little more than a century and a harbinger of a future world-historical event if not world-ender) reported -- this is a good example of when such as ""anencephalic"" rather than ""just"" ""howlingly incompetent and brain-dead"" is rated -- that (if I dont recall this exactly its close) 77200 square miles of glass was broken in that (not-so-glassy to start) Siberian city. That for you spatially and even area-challenged types (a rubric covering seemingly almost all ""top""-outlet journos and academics) is almost exactly Nebraskas area. Of glass. Broken. In a Siberian industrial city. So just how stupid can things get before someone says something? When I saw that piece ca. two months after pub there were 1161 reader comments. Fascinated I scanned all though maybe missed a few. Maybe half were sane (relatively good for MSM reader comments); i.e. rationally or almost rationally discussing the meteor from every conceivable PoV rather than banging on about say the president being an illegal alien. But not one I saw noted the 90000 lb. gorilla in the closet the (cheers Kris) ludicrous inflation of the broken-glass area by well over uh (do you comprehend?) 100 million percent. (I looked up a credible figure for the broken glass I think in square meters did some should-be-second-grade math and figured it ca. 135 U.S. football fields with end-zones. Thats a lot of broken glass from an explosion 60+ miles away. But Nebraska? This again while memorable is not unique. Its Where We Are In ""Journalism."" And academe. Did you know the say University of Texas fanatically refuses to admit wrong one of its distinguished profs citation in a scholarly book of Montevideo as Chiles capital? Or say PBS (among well over 1000 such examples filed on a few years light sampling) continues to repeat daily somewhere in America on ""History Detectives"" that President Taft was VP under TR? Hey they put the words in the mouth of an Ivy League department chair so it must be right. Or say the New York Times IDs Robert E. Lee in a copyrighted feature thats either a verbatim reprint of his 1870 obit or a modern notion of such as Robert Edmund? (Atop of course badly erring on at least a dozen basic major Civil War facts?) Theres your 15-minute Intro to Reality courtesy one willing to try to help you not be jackasses and accomplices as comsumer-lemmings in The Problem that j-schools and media/academe ""critics"" for all their 25/8 blathering about politics real and imagined will not discuss. ++++++++++++ So people toss whatever barbs you like at simple correction of negligence incompetence and stupidity; they shame you not me. My first post stands unscratched based on all facts (and those stated as unknown). Were you adults youd now man/lady-up and (as) graciously (as possible in the circumstances) own your fault while acknowledging the ""editors."" Ms. Rodman maybe you can lady-up. Im sadly pretty sure Kris cant man-up. Reply Kristopher Tapley says October 3 2015 at 1030 am ""Paid stooge? Just partial to Variety?"" Well I DO work here. As for the rest too long; didnt read. Youre clearly challenged. But good luck. Reply Mark Powell says October 2 2015 at 608 pm Earth to Variety and all posted commenters 17 posted comments and not one on either of the two ludicrous howlers in this review three weeks old as I write? As ever be there 17 or 1700 comments on a story in whatever ""learned"" outlet I wonder if thats because everyones anencephalic or because the outlet rather than correcting errors scrubs comments correcting factual errors. Daniel DEfoe not DAfoe wrote ""Robinson Crusoe."" Faking Being A Learned Outlet 101 includes not name-dropping (here just the putative inventor of the modern novel and one of Englishs acknowledged great writers) and misspelling the name. Maybe Variety (forget its ""chief international film critic"") ""editors"" are confused between Defoe and living actor Willem Dafoe. Another syllabus item in FBALO101 is at least paying attention however ignorant to the review subject (i.e. actually reading the book watching the film -- and not making stuff up when not doing so). Watney/Damon is stranded with just ""400 sols"" (sol denoting a Martian solar day) of food? I havent seen the film -- and I unlike Varietys illustriously incompetent incompetently illustrious chief international film critic wont be paid to see it let alone early at a foreign film festival -- but all the several other outlets reviews Ive now read that touch that aspect say hes stranded with a month of food. A Martian solar day is ca. 24 hours 37 minutes so 400 sols is 400-and-some Earth days. Well over an Earth year many times more than a month. Still a fraction of the time before a supposed four-year-distant rescue mission but wildly different than what other reviewers say is in the film. The second fault reminds me of e.g. Roger Eberts review of 2009s Clive Owen-Naomi Watts ""The International"" citing Palestinian terrorists and nuclear weapons in the story. There are none. Ebert was confused with another film and/or just made stuff up. And of course Eberts paper was apoplectic at notice of the embarrassing error refusing to even admit let alone correct it (like virtually every supposed journalistic or academic outlet on whatever hard-factual error). Lets see if this comment posts and stays and whether or not the errors are corrected. Reply Kristopher Tapley says October 2 2015 at 700 pm 1) There is enough food to last one month for the entire crew. Since the crew is gone with Watney left behind that number is able to be stretched with rationing to 400 sols. This is explained in the movie. 2) Daniel ""Dafoe"" is an easy enough typo to make Im sure just about anyone would agree. But please give us another dissertation on how these two items (one of which is something you got wrong) count as ""ludicrous howlers"" in your angry little world. Reply Jeanette Rodman says October 2 2015 at 1146 pm Dearest Mr. Tapley You should have read the book The Martian in which Mark Watney clearly says he has enough food at 3/4 rations to last about 400 sols. Assuming they havent changed that in the film this was not an error. Ill give you Defoe though. The book was terrific and very funny. I hope they kept the funny. I am heartened to hear they kept the nerdy. Sanman1 says October 1 2015 at 450 pm ""Conquest Of Space"" is a1956 mission to Mars George Pal movie. check it out. Reply gaurav says September 29 2015 at 846 am does Sean Bean die in it ) Reply Chuck spets says September 29 2015 at 1205 pm I read the book The story held my grateful attention with a vivid never boring or un-credible episode right to the very end. I am looking forward to the release of the DVD. Matt Damon is probably the best choice for the maim character. I believe it will be an international favorite. Reply snipping tool says September 25 2015 at 1037 pm Maybe Rachel should review more movies as I very much enjoyed this one When I read ""The Martian"" I felt as though all of the detailed descriptions were begging to be filmed. I really want to see that tricked-out rover with the inflatable bedroom. And as Rachel points out it isnt like the film adaptation is going to sacrifice a bunch of nuanced subtle prose relating to Marks inner life. I thought it was telling that whenever the character started contemplating anything as touchy-feely as say the quietness of Mars he admonished himself and immediately returned to sensible topics like heat dissipation. But what intrigued me most was the notion that in addition to a personal quest for survival this story was also all about spending millions of dollars to rescue one individual. From the strict standpoint of ethical pragmatism the argument could be made that this money could have been spent saving many many more lives here on Earth. (You know that whole ""needs of the many"" business..) But the underlying premise was an argument against an Ethical Optimization Algorithm in favor of the aesthetic desire to save this one salient life. Which means that this highly-technical science-geek movie depends entirely on an unquantifiable notion of human love.

Reply katz says September 13 2015 at 501 am Mission to Mars and Red Planet were both awesome movies. 2001 A Space Odyssey is of course the standard bearer. Reply Craig Mayfield says September 13 2015 at 533 pm Well...to survive at anything...ya gotta stay cool...life is fragile...tough it out with humor if you can...but methinks it comes much more than once.. Reply JT says September 12 2015 at 1154 am While the book was an exciting read and Im sure Ridley will deliver an equally great movie the entire setup for the story is based on impossible science in a story where the hero has to science the shit out of things to survive. The hero is stranded on Mars due to a deadly wind storm that nearly destroys the base and almost kills him -- an impossibility. Mars has an atmosphere of just 1%. A hurricane force wind on Earth would be a mere breeze on Mars. There are plenty of things on Mars that could kill you but wind is not one of them. Reply JAB says September 12 2015 at 954 am It looks like Scott Goddard amp; company did the novel justice. Sorry Star Wars toy collectors I am much more excited about this movie than anything with talking droids in it. Reply Jeanette Rodman says October 2 2015 at 1149 pm As Andy Weir says in his comments he had to fictionalize that bit.... Reply Kaavish says September 12 2015 at 335 am stopped reading after the low blow aimed towards George Lucas. Grow up. Reply dug says September 13 2015 at 502 pm Im not sure youve correctly identified the person who needs to grow up. Reply Ken says September 11 2015 at 711 pm STAR WARS is sci-fi? Hardly. Its a fantasy - a great one but fantasy nonetheless. CLOSE ENCOUNTERS/3rd KIND can be considered sci-fi. And really ALIEN and BLADE RUNNER the most important sci-fi movies? Is the critic on some kind of space crack? How bout a little influential entry from 1968 called 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY...it was directed by a little known visionary named Stanley Kubrick. (You may want to add DESTINATION MOON and DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL to the list.) Still cant wait to see THE MARTIAN. Reply pushingbits says September 11 2015 at 547 pm You mentioned Silent Running and I almost cried. I thought that jewel was forgotten. Reply Dean Treadway says September 11 2015 at 305 pm In mentioning Charles and Ray Eames film POWERS OF TEN the article refers to them as brothers. This is incorrect. They were a husband-and-wife team. Also. have to quibble with the exclusion of 2001 in the ""most influential sci-fi films"" statement. Its 2001 then maybe STAR WARS then BLADE RUNNER and then maybe METROPOLIS then ALIEN if one is being generous. Reply Bill Warren says September 11 2015 at 303 pm I think the second most-influential SF movie is 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY. Reply stevenkovacs says September 11 2015 at 222 pm Im going to see it Reply 85wzen says September 11 2015 at 147 pm You should read the book first... its very good.

Andy Weirs self-published 2011 novel envisioned the plight of an American astronaut stranded on Mars in the not-so-distant future using his command of physics and botany to survive for months while his Earthbound colleagues cobbled together a rescue plan. Weir compensated for a lack of commanding prose with hard science that in retrospect makes Christopher Nolans ""Interstellar"" look like pure fantasy. Scotts movie follows suit in many ways unfolding -- in ways both good and bad -- as a kind of anti-""Interstellar"" Rather than mirroring Nolans attempt to combine awe-inspiring cinema with tangible theories of other worlds ""The Martian"" is rooted in this one (and its not-so-distant neighbor). Weirs story adapted to the screen by Drew Goddard remains more or less intact At the very beginning Ares 3 astronauts exploring Mars empty red landscape suddenly make a break for it when a dust storm overtakes their camp; in the chaos Watney (Matt Damon) gets knocked to the side and his bereaved captain (Jessica Chastain) assumes the worst. But while Weir jumped into the aftermath of these proceedings opening with Watneys diaries ""The Martian"" allows Scott to establish this seemingly doom-laden scenario in spectacular visual terms. Mirroring many of the sights and sounds that distinguished the spaceship maneuvers in ""Prometheus"" Scott shows the crew -- which also includes bit parts for Sebastian Stan Kate Mara and Michael Pena -- shooting devastated glances at the one empty chair of their vessel as they rocket to the heavens. The image goes a long way toward setting the stage for much of the action which involves Watney alone on Mars alternately babbling to himself and engaging in ""MacGyver""-like tactics to stay alive. From growing potatoes indoors using his own waste as fertilizer to tracking down an old NASA lander in a bid to regain communication with Earth Watneys tactics offer a constant sense of excitement. The innovations rapidly pass by but the details feel just coherent enough to create the elements of a genuine survival story. Following the beats of Weirs novel ""The Martian"" broadens its terrain when NASA discovers the interplanetary castaway via satellite and must brief the world. While dyspeptic NASA chief Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels frowning on autopilot) attempts to weigh the various risks involved in bringing Watney home ambitious project manager Venkat Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) dashes from one workstation to the next crunching numbers and constantly changing course. Meanwhile the other astronauts remain oblivious to Watneys ongoing state -- until theyre not at which point ""The Martian"" adds yet another set of strategists to its stacked deck. In this swirling cast of intense figures attempting a bold gamble ""The Martian"" sometimes struggles from too many moving pieces. The massive ensemble makes room for enjoyable bit parts by a deadpan Donald Glover as an ultra-geeky computer genius Mackenzie Davis as a satellite analyst and the ever-impressive Sean Bean as a wayward consultant but Scott never manages to shake the sense of stock characters tossing around technical language with no semblance of interior lives. Intrusive title cards identifying each new face only further the impression of an overly busy picture. Of course Scotts best work involves stories with immediate hooks and ""The Martian"" certainly offers plenty. Its strongest moments find Watney journeying through his barren surroundings while his colleagues watch helplessly from afar. The scope of these scenes shot by regular Scott collaborator Dariusz Wolski convey massive scale and isolation in a single elegant frame. Watney meanwhile remains the best-realized character with his smarmy one-liners elevating the otherwise constant uncertainty surrounding his fate. For every complex assessment of his next plan comes another throwaway gag about the awful disco music left behind by his captain. Further stabilizing the material Goddards script tacks on an epilogue clearly intended to polish off the novels rough edges. As commercial entertainment ""The Martian"" delivers on expectations of a ""smart"" blockbuster even as it adheres to the formula of a relatively simple feel-good drama. Though ""Interstellar"" aimed for more ambition ""The Martian"" plays it safer Its a brainy studio effort that sticks to familiar ground in more ways than one. Even more noteworthy than its daring zero gravity finale is the movies tone which strikes a cheery contrast to Scotts usual ominous routine. In the last few years the 77-year-old filmmaker has endured his own castaway story stranded in a no-mans land of troubled projects. But like Watney Scott is a keen survivalist and ""The Martian"" proves he still has a few tricks left. Grade B ""The Martian"" premieres this week at the Toronto International Film Festival and opens nationwide on October 2.

We see the Ares crews families and we get a sense of Parnells quirky work relationship with his bosses and colleagues. I wonder if this reviewer has seen Apollo 13 which was based on actual events and where much of the supporting cast of characters were similarly presented. Plus this reviewer doesnt really make much of a connection between Interstellar and The Martian other than that theyre both science fiction films that happen to star Matt Damon. In short this review is rather amateur-hour and not much better than what Id expect from a high school writing assignment from an articulate but rather lazy or sloppy student. Grade C- Reply Adam May 12 2016 558 pm Just saw the movie and I couldnt agree more with the review. The execution was great and there were some truly marvelous shots embedded throughout however it was very transparent; each sequence seemed a dance rather than a fight and for survivals sake it was ironic. Reply Heywood Jablomie May 12 2016 558 pm Ridleys last three films have been his most personal and uncompromising since his FIRST three. The tragic death of his brother seemed to liberate the auteur in Ridley. To say that he has been ""trapped in a no mans land"" is pathetic. I guess this writer wishes for him to go back to the days of Russell Crowe and roses. Reply Ikjyot Singh Kohli May 12 2016 558 pm I really wish folks would stop calling Interstellar fantasy. The science in Interstellar was 100% accurate See my article at Relativity Digest. Reply Hans May 12 2016 558 pm I just assumed that The Martian was a sequel to Interstellar. What is Matt Damons character survived the space station explosion? Reply Jeffrey May 12 2016 558 pm I have never been enamoured with Ridley Scott and I read some of the details on how Matt Damons character goes about trying to survive. I dont care how many critics go gaga over this film. Im out. Reply JAB May 12 2016 558 pm Any who read -amp; loved- the book knew that this movie would have as much in common with ""Interstellar"" as ""Apollo 13"" had with ""2001"" (3 movies which Ive seen multiple times). This review is actually the least favorable review Ive read so far from the serious reviewers opining from last nights premiere. Reply Anita May 12 2016 558 pm Theyre characters in the book are not ""bit-parts"" they are key and substantial. Yes they are very accomplished actors. Cant wait to see their collaborative efforts in this movie. Reply Anna May 12 2016 558 pm `Bit parts` for Sebastian StanKate Mara and Michael Pena.I`m guessing they`re a little more than `bit parts`.Those are three accomplished actors.
