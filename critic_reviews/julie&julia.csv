Email| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + ""Julie amp; Julia is the easiest thing Nora Ephron has ever done with a movie. Theres not much to argue with. Half the film is spent with Meryl Streep as Julia Child in France in 1949. Half is spent 50 years later with Amy Adams as Julie Powell a Texan living in Queens who devotes a year (and a blog) to exploring the recipes from the tome Child spent a decade completing ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking.Ephron has adapted two memoirs Childs ""My Life in France and Powells ""Julie amp; Julia 365 Days 524 Recipes 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen. And the movie shes built out of them is more than a tale of two women (although it is certainly that). Its a tale of two different ages for women. The movie is lighter than that sounds. Ephron doesnt make dissertations. She makes ""Youve Got Mail.So the movie glides for more than an hour like butter in a hot skillet. But it doesnt glide witlessly. We jump back and forth between France where Child is the 36-year-old wife of Paul Child (Stanley Tucci) a Foreign Service officer and New York where Powell lives in a cute apartment above a pizzeria with her husband Eric (Chris Messina).The movie begins with neither woman really knowing what to do with herself. Child takes French classes learns to play bridge tries hat making. None of it suits her. She winds up trying to enroll in the Cordon Bleu culinary school over the objections of an imperious headmistress who once Child is accepted wishes her nothing but ill. These scenes of this giant vaguely slouchy American woman (Child stood 6 foot 2) towering over tiny meticulous men at a counter are a riot. One of her goals is to master the art of the minced onion. She sets her knife to dozens which gives Tucci an opportunity to do some tickling pinpoint slapstick upon seeing and presumably smelling the eye-watering aroma that a pitchers mound of chopped onions produces.This is blissful moviemaking. Much of the pleasure we have in watching it comes from seeing Tucci and obviously Streep connect. But its also the effortlessness Ephron reveals in bringing it all together. There could have been something cartoonish about Streep who usually appears to be standing on a box to approximate Childs height. But beneath each of these scenes between Streep and Tucci and Streep and the women playing her French coauthors of ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking (Linda Emond and Helen Carrey) and her sister (Jane Lynch) between Streep and the vegetables playing the food is a deep abiding joy. Its not just the onions that bring a tear to the eye. The image of Streeps china-plate face topped with Childs curled red hair is automatically amusing. But she sings in Childs congested falsetto with an uncanny blend of phlegm and melody. Its Child in the key of Streep. (""What could this mean? she intones poring over an entry in a Larousse dictionary.) Ephron expresses a loud vote of confidence in her stars interpretation when she sits the Powells down on the sofa to laugh at Dan Aykroyds ""Saturday Night Live version of Child. The director is showing us the difference between inspired sketch comedy and actorly soul.People who knew or worshiped Child will question some of the movies details. Did she and Paul for instance really have this much sex? Was he this romantic? (""Wheres my big sprig? Paul says to his wife.) But that misses the larger point of these scenes. When in an American movie do regular people have that much sex? Plus - and this is important - Stanley Tucci is very sexy.Ephron understands this marriage this woman her friendships the hassles not only of finishing a massive book but getting it published. Ephron doesnt seem to find the same fulfillment in her movies modern New Yorker. Powells decision to start a blog stems from frustration with her job at the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation taking calls from people waiting for money after 9/11. Shes not the go-getter her friends are. Theres a funny restaurant scene between Powell and some girlfriends whom she dislikes seeing (""Ritual cobb salad. Dreading. Dreading. Dreading). Shes a dolphin. The girlfriends are sharks. One of them writes a pitying profile of her for New York magazine.I imagine part of Ephrons attraction to Powell as a character is that shes as whimsically old-fashioned in some ways as Ephrons other heroines. Powell cooks from Childs books in pearls for one thing. The spiky pouty altogether marvelous Mary Lynn Rajskub plays Powells best friend but youd be forgiven for wondering whether her true cosmic sisters are any of the women Meg Ryan has played in Ephrons other movies. There is as much tenderness and truth about friendship in this half of the movie as there is the other. But the joy of cooking is replaced here by the stress of it. Killing a lobster boning a duck Were too wimpy for that.A few people have worried that Adamss half of the movie isnt as lively or as brightly lit as Streeps (it isnt) - or that Adams isnt Streep. But it isnt that the Adams half suffers from Adams not being Streep. Its that Julie suffers (as all American cooks do) from not being Julia. And this is why the Powell parts of the film work. Its Ephrons way of coming to terms with a real consequence of post-feminism. Powell is a woman in a job she hates who finds a source of liberation doing something certain liberated women still see as oppressive housework.She turns to Childs book partly as therapy partly as anthropology. Cooking used to be about cooking but in so many ways its became about politics and the politics loosely start to take their toll on Powells marriage. Powells loving husband having been trained to accept her as a professional equal now has to learn to take his wifes kitchen work seriously. Paul Child is just as fully evolved but free of any angst over his wifes success. Hes rooting for her.Ephron works best when telling tandem stories. The paramours-to-be in ""When Harry Met Sally. . . ""Sleepless in Seattle and ""Youve Got Mail talked and typed their way into idealized romances (gallingly so in the case of ""Youve Got Mail). This time the two halves dont meet physically or philosophically. Powells project becomes a media sensation but rumor has it that Child finds it frivolous and doesnt approve (she didnt). So this might be the first of Ephrons romantic duplexes to culminate in heartbreak. It also might be the first that manages to comment on itself. The unbearable lightness of some of Ephrons moviemaking finally meets the sting of her essays. Ephron has been guilty of frivolity too. But in ""Julie amp; Julia she doesnt merely concede that food is life. She celebrates it.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation.

A happily married but childless housewife desperate for something meaningful to do she is larger and louder than women are allowed to be anywhere towering over the petite French and even her husband played here with bemusement and palpable joy by Stanley Tucci. Ephron has a lot of fun with optical illusions which emphasise Childs stature and when her equally gigantic sister comes to stay some delicious comedy occurs.We experience the ecstatic effect of French food--with its mouthwatering stocks herbs sauces stuffings glazes souffles and mousses--on mid-20th century Americans reared on cheese spread and tinned meat.Ephron is often disparaged as a chic flick director despite the huge success of her hits (Sleepless In Seattle When Harry Met Sally etc.) but the cleverness of this film which shouldnt work and does proves she is one of the greats.The counterpoint to Julia Childs journey to worldwide fame and influence is the modern story of Julie Powell (played with equal bravura by Amy Adams) a childlike waif with the will of iron who keenly feels her lack of notability and yearns to be somebody. Based on the blog which became a best selling book the film follows her decision to spend one year cooking from Childs classic the Mastering the Art of French Cooking every day. As neurotic self-obsessed and insecure as Child is majestically grounded and outgoing Julie nearly drives the audience if not her encouraging husband to distraction with her flops and crises but this film is as much about happy marriages as it is about the need for women to find fulfillment just as men do beyond the parameters of parenthood.Ebullient witty and wonderfully warm-hearted Julie amp; Julia is a celebration of how to live life to the full.

Comments (7) click to enlarge Julie amp; Julia Video 2009 Writer-director Nora Ephron combines two cooking memoirs Julia Childs My Life in France and Julie Powells Julie and Julia stirring briskly to keep them from separating in the bowl. The main reason for seeing this is Meryl Streeps deft comic performance as the fluttery TV chef shown here in the 1950s as she learns her craft and sets out to publish a cookbook of French cuisine for Americans. The other half of the story stars Amy Adams as Powell who made a name for herself in 2002 with a year-long project to prepare and blog about every recipe in Childs book. The parallels are interesting up to a point but as Ephron cuts between the two women Powells self-pitying spats with her husband (Chris Messina) settle at the level of Ephrons crowd-pleasing rom-coms (Sleepless in Seattle Youve Got Mail) even as Childs loving marriage to U.S. diplomat Paul Child (Stanley Tucci) grows more rich and complex. One keeps waiting for the title characters lives to intersect but when they finally do--with a reporter asking Powell to comment on Childs disparaging remarks about her--Ephron scurries away from the moment and its implications.

"Review Julie amp; Julia is just the right dish - Mercury News Hot Topics Big Sur fire Balloon crash No-parachute skydive Deadline 29 to Vegas Sheryl Sandbergs Option B Steve Torrence Ask Amy Comics SV150 Print Email Font ResizeReview Julie amp; Julia is just the right dishBy Charlie McCollumcmccollummercurynews.comPosted 08/07/2009 120000 AM PDTSometimes a meal can be less than perfect but still so thoroughly enjoyable that a missed ingredient here or a bit of overcooking there doesnt really matter.Thats the case with ""Julie amp; Julia"" the delicious dish of a movie whipped up by writer-director Nora Ephron from two books -- food blogger Julie Powells bestseller about her attempt to cook her way through Julia Childs gastronomical guide ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" and Childs autobiographical volume ""My Life in France."" (The latter was published after her death with additional work by her grandnephew Alex Prudhomme.) There are flaws in the way Ephron has concocted the recipe but only a true food snob would complain.Much like Ephrons ""Sleepless in Seattle"" ""Julie amp; Julia"" uses parallel story lines. In post-World War II Paris Child is trying to decide what to do with her time while her (very supportive) husband Paul works at the U.S. Embassy. ""What do you like best?"" Paul asks her. ""Well I like to eat"" replies Julia with the kind of joie de vivre that marked her life. So its off to cooking school and eventually to cowriting ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" with Louisette Bertholle and Simone Beck.Advertisement In modern-day New York Julie Powell -- working at a dead-end government job and living in a cramped apartment over a pizza joint in Queens -- is also looking for something more. Her solution cook (and blog) her way through all 534 recipes in Childs book over exactly one year. That means learning to bone duck for duck en croute make a credible boeuf bourguignon and develop the proper technique for poaching an egg (not as easy as it may sound).It is something of a small miracle that Ephron manages to infuse the two womens culinary journeys with such energy. For most of its two-hour-plus running time ""Julie amp; Julia"" gallops along even though testing and blogging recipes are hardly dynamic cinematic undertakings. (Good foodie movies -- ""Big Night"" ""Ratatouille"" ""Babettes Feast"" -- are few and far between.) And when Powell attacks her final recipe (that pesky duck en croute) with verve (""no fear Julia no fear"") and the first edition of ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" arrives at Childs home you want to stand up and cheer their fierce dedication.While Ephrons words are a delight -- this is a truly witty film that earns its considerable laughs honestly -- a very good cast gives the film its true joie de vivre.From the first moment she appears on screen Meryl Streep is an absolute wonder as Julia giving an imposing performance that never once falls into parody. (Ephron uses a long clip of Dan Aykroyds memorable take on Child from ""Saturday Night Live"" as if to point up just how much life Streep brings to the role.) Every line is sharply delivered and Streep even manages to play tall (Child was 6-foot-2; Streep is 5-foot-6) with help from some camera tricks.A very droll Stanley Tucci is almost as good as Paul Child providing a perfect balance to Streep. As Powell Amy Adams -- who held her own with Streep in ""Doubt"" -- leavens her inherent sweetness with just enough tartness; Chris Messina (""Away We Go"") does a nice job as her husband Eric who often wonders what he has gotten himself into by encouraging this cooking and blogging thing. And the film is littered with marvelous little supporting turns stage actress Linda Emond as Simone Beck Jane Lynch as Childs sister Dorothy Frances Sternhagen as Irma Rombauer of ""The Joy of Cooking"" and Mary Lynn Rajskub (Chloe on ""24"") who gets some of the best lines as a friend of Powells.The film does have some flat moments. It could have been more tightly edited (the Aykroyd bit goes on too long). Despite Adams best efforts Powell is a bit too sweet as written and the character doesnt completely resemble the Julie Powell in the book. Most notably there is a imbalance between the story lines Childs life was so compelling (and Streep and Tucci are so good) that you may come away wishing more time had been spent in Paris and less time in Queens.But so much of ""Julie amp; Julia"" is such a tasty delight that its flaws are only marginally bothersome.Indulge in a hearty meal before seeing the film. The food in ""Julie amp; Julia"" (designed by Susan Spungen former food editor of Martha Stewarts Living) looks so luscious that I started drooling when Child is first served sole meuniere in a Paris bistro. By the time Powell serves the duck en croute at the end I was ready for a five-course meal.Bon appetitContact Charlie McCollum at 408-920-5245.""Julie amp; Julia""HHRating PG-13 (for brief strong language and some sensuality)Cast Meryl Streep Amy Adams Stanley Tucci Chris Messina and Linda EmondDirector-writer Nora EphronRunning time 2 hours 2 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Talend Silicon Valleys latest tech IPO has a strong debutSource Tesla looking at cameras radar in Florida crashCartoons Hillary Clinton makes history Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

By David Denby Brad Pitt as an officer and Diane Kruger as a spy in Quentin Tarantinos movie.   Credit Illustration by John Ritter In Quentin Tarantinos ""Inglourious Basterds""--an extravagant jest about the Second World War--Joseph Goebbels commissions a propaganda combat film and assembles the Nazi leaders in occupied Paris in 1944 for its premiere at a lovely Art Deco theatre. As the big night approaches groups of European movie people and Jewish American soldiers plot to use the occasion to eliminate the Nazi command and bring an end to the Third Reich. (Some plan to set fire to the theatre others to blow it up.) The anti-Nazi cinemaphiles include the female theatre owner; her black lover and projectionist; a leading German actress who spies for the British; and of all people a critic--an English expert on German cinema who attempts to pass himself off as an S.S. officer. The Americans are themselves right out of the movies the Inglourious Basterds as they are known are a kind of Jewish Dirty Dozen led by a Gentile Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) a blunt jawjutting tough guy from Tennessee (which is where Tarantino is from). In brief Tarantino has gone past his usual practice of decorating his movies with homages to others. This time he has pulled the film-archive door shut behind him--theres hardly a flash of light indicating that the world exists outside the cinema except as the basis of a nutbrain fable. Since 1941 the Basterds have been killing German soldiers in occupied France sometimes by beating them with a baseball bat. Then they scalp them (the explanation Raine has Native American blood). The lieutenant also carves swastikas into Nazi foreheads. Whether the Basterds are Tarantinos ideal of an all-American killing team or his parody of one is hard to know. Very little in ""Basterds"" is meant to be taken straight but the movie isnt quite farce either. Its lodged in an uneasy nowheresville between counterfactual pop wish fulfillment and trashy exploitation between exuberant nonsense and cinema scholasticism. In the middle of this crazy narrative Tarantino pauses to pay his respects like an unctuous film professor to the immortals of German cinema. The great G. W. Pabst Emil Jannings (They are brought to Paris for the premiere.) The cinema it seems is both innocent and heroic; it creates great art and it will end the war. The fire is started by the burning of old nitrate-based movies behind the screen. ""Inglourious Basterds"" is not boring but its ridiculous and appallingly insensitive--a Louisville Slugger applied to the head of anyone who has ever taken the Nazis the war or the Resistance seriously. Not that Tarantino intends any malice toward such earnest people. The Nazis for him are merely available movie tropes--articulate monsters with a talent for sadism. By making the Americans cruel too he escapes the customary division of good and evil along national lines but he escapes any sense of moral accountability as well. In a Tarantino war everyone commits atrocities. Like all the directors work after ""Jackie Brown"" the movie is pure sensation. Its disconnected from feeling and an eerie blankness--its too shallow to be called nihilism--undermines even the best scenes. At the beginning for example in 1941 an S.S. patrol led by Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) questions a French farmer about a family of Jews who may be hiding on his property. The scene is methodically staged. Colonel Landa is polite even flirtatious and Tarantino increases the tension gradually shooting and editing the confrontation with classical rigor. Landa promises the farmer--a man of great dignity--that he will protect his family if he turns over the Jews which he finally does though unwillingly. They are hiding under the floorboards and Landas men shoot all of them except for a young woman Shosanna (Melanie Laurent) who disappears into the countryside. (We meet her again later as the owner of the Paris theatre.) Does Landa keep his promise and allow the farmers family to survive? The scene ends and Tarantino doesnt say. His refusal to show us how events play out comes across as sheer negligence or indifference. Moral callousness has been part of Tarantinos style in the past. In ""Pulp Fiction"" his merry roundelay set among Los Angeles lowlifes the aggressive acts that the characters commit against one another are so abrupt and extreme that they become funny. The movies outrageous panache gave the audience license to enjoy the violence as lawless entertainment. But in ""Basterds"" Tarantino is mucking about with a tragic moment of history. Chaplin and Lubitsch played with Nazis too but they worked as farceurs using comedy to warn of catastrophe; they didnt carve up Nazis using horror-film flourishes. Tarantinos hyper-violent narrative reveals merely that he still daydreams like a teen-ager. It should be said however that the scenes set in Paris in which Tarantino imagines the formal but abrasive nature of social life among the Nazi elite are all beautifully designed (by David and Sandy Wasco) and photographed (by Robert Richardson). The director has also given prominence to a good actor new to American audiences the Austrian-born Christoph Waltz who as Landa exudes the kind of insinuating menace characteristic of Nazis in old Warner Bros. movies. The role may be a cliche but Waltz is brilliant in it; he takes an intellectual pleasure in devilry. The film is skillfully made but its too silly to be enjoyed even as a joke. Tarantino may think that he is doing Jews a favor by launching this revenge fantasy (in the burning theatre working-class Jewish boys get to pump Hitler and Goring full of lead) but somehow I doubt that the gesture will be appreciated. Tarantino has become an embarrassment his virtuosity as a maker of images has been overwhelmed by his inanity as an idiot de la cinematheque. ""Inglourious Basterds"" is a hundred and fifty-two minutes long but Tarantinos fans will wait for the directors cut which no doubt shows Shirley Temple arriving at Treblinka with the Glenn Miller band and performing a special rendition of ""Baby Take a Bow"" from the immortal 1934 movie of the same name before she fetchingly leads the S.S. guards to the gas chamber. Julia Child in ""The French Chef""--her first TV series which began in 1963--was amazingly quick. Moving her pots and pans and little bowls of chopped onions and clarified butter around the counter she might have been a three-card-monte player in Times Square. American home cooks may have mastered Childs recipes but her hands in their sureness and speed were unmatchable by anyone but a pro. Child was strong in so many ways and her absence of fear and self-consciousness allowed her to express a good cheer and a satisfaction in life that even a five-year-old could feel. Her verbal style in its high-pitched insistence may have resembled that of a Boston dowager but she was a Californian from Pasadena and probably spoke that way naturally not as a cultural inheritance but as an irreducible expression of self. She was incapable of modern irony. In ""Julie amp; Julia"" Nora Ephron who wrote and directed and her star Meryl Streep push the mannerisms a bit. They have to--the comic possibilities are irresistible. The filmmakers mounted Streep on platform heels stretched her out and put her together with the compact Stanley Tucci (as Childs loving husband Paul). Like a tall ship in full sail Streep leans tilts and billows. Odd explosions of air--whoops exclamations--come hurtling through the passageways. She runs out of breath and then settles mysteriously like an old Bible that italicizes ordinary words on a single syllable. Its all extremely funny but Ephron and Streep stop short of camp. They know that theres no way anyone can make or would want to make Julia Child look second-rate. The movie alternates between Childs story as a restless American in Paris in the nineteen-fifties longing to write a cookbook and the adventures in Queens in 2002 of a lost young American wife (Amy Adams) who sets out to replicate Childs recipes--a structure that is more a rhyming device than a dramatic idea. Yet it works well enough to hold together a dual fable of driving ambition and anxious discipleship. ""Julie amp; Julia"" is one of the gentlest most charming American movies of the past decade. Its subject is less food as something to cook than food as the binding and unifying element of dinner parties friendship and marriage. Manners and sociability obsess Nora Ephron How did a happy middle-aged couple like the Childs speak to each other sixty years ago? How does that compare with the way a young couple speak now? And the director exploits a neat little joke--the formal and serene Childs have a hot sex life while the hip young couple hardly make love at all. The miracle of the Childs marriage was that food was never the main course. It was more like a perpetual appetizer.  David Denby has been a staff writer and film critic at The New Yorker since 1998.

You go to a movie like this for the sauces and stews and for the considerable pleasure of seeing (and listening to) Meryl Streeps drolly exuberant performance as Julia Child the towering culinary icon with the distinctively plummy vocal intonations evoking a flute an oboe and Ed Wynn after a couple of sherries. Best known for ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and ""Youve Got Mail"" writer-director Nora Ephron adapts and intertwines two books here Childs ""My Life in France"" (co-authored by Alex Prudhomme) and Julie Powells ""Julie amp; Julia."" The latter grew out of Powells online experiment a year spent cooking and blogging her way through all 524 recipes from the seminal Child volume ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking."" (This was in the off-hours from her job at the Lower Manhattan Development Corp. in the wake of 9/11.) The movie is scrupulous in juggling its stories and time frames to a fault While Ephron surely wouldnt equate Powells modest achievement with Childs the structure cant help but inflate the former at the expense of the latter. Yet Amy Adams (above with Chris Messina) is very good as Powell. She sells it without overselling it and while her domestic crises are eminently predictable--will the marital spat get resolved? Why I believe it will--Adams has a way of playing into a cliche so that it becomes tolerable even viable. Everybody in this upscale comfort-food movie has been shrewdly cast from Stanley Tucci (as Childs loving diplomat husband) to Messina (as Powells easygoing mate) to Linda Emond (a wide-eyed delight as Childs French cohort Simone Beck who wrote the cookbook along with a third credited author Louise Bertholle). The film is two films one beginning in 1949 with the Childs arrival in Paris the other beginning in 2002 with the Powells arrival in Queens. We hear Streeps voice before we see her and its almost Ephrons way of revealing that yes Streep has once again nailed The Voice. As Child falls in love with Paris the stars enthusiasm in playing such an enthusiastic sparkler is infectious. She and Tucci work in deft counterpoint--shes a fountain hes a quiet pond--and the first time the Childs go to a bistro and taste the catch of the day cooked in an ungodly amount of butter the dialogue goes like this ""Its just--""""I know.""""I mean--""""I know"" Theyre in heaven and were drooling. At heart ""Julie amp; Julia"" is a writer-empowerment picture contrasting the painstaking nearly decade-long development of Childs cookbook while she and her husband contend with job reassignments all over the globe with Powells head-first dive into her blog. It turns into a hit and a book and (as the films end-credits say proudly) a movie. One cant help but wonder if Ephron wouldve been better off focusing exclusively on Child Shes simply more interesting screen company. But Ephrons commercial touch serves her well here. And when Jane Lynch shows up as Childs even taller sister for a brief but choice scene youre seeing simpatico comic acting of an exceptionally high order. In some films Streep can come off like a solo act (especially in comedies); shes spectacularly assured every second but often in a way that trumpets all the details that go into a performance from the dialect to the physicality. In ""Julie amp; Julia"" shes doing a lot and you could describe certain bits as stooping (literally stooping the way Child used to) to shamelessness. Then she turns around and makes you cry. And then laugh again.

"Julie amp; Julia | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; julie-julia ) Julie amp; Julia (United States 2009) August 08 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli When I was three years old and my playmates were happily watching Sesame Street and cartoons I would sit in front of the television and gaze at the force of nature that was Julia Child (I also liked Graham Kerr The Galloping Gourmet). Her larger-than-life personality coupled with a self-deprecating wit and a genuine love for what she was doing came across even to someone as young as I was at the time. It didnt matter that her subjects were cooking (something about which I knew nothing) and food (one of lifes necessities I wished I could have gone without); Julias program was more entertaining than any of the kid-oriented mid-afternoon shows. To hell with Bullwinkle and Rocky; I wanted The French Chef. As enjoyable as Julia Child was to watch in 30-minute bites however her off-screen life was terribly ordinary and not the sort of thing that would merit cinematic treatment. Perhaps thats why writer/director Nora Ephron chose to merge Julias story with that of a 2002 blogger who cooked her way through all of Julias recipes. The marriage of these two tales however should have ended in divorce court. There are two serious problems with Julie amp; Julia - one is structural and the other pertains to dramatic thrust. Before discussing those however let me say a few words about the acting. Meryl Streeps interpretation of the iconic chef is uncanny. For about two hours Streep is Julia and its not merely a case of mimicry. Shes so good that one can almost understand the existence of the film merely as an excuse to get Streep on screen in the role. Alas movies need more than top performances to succeed. Streeps co-star (for the second time in less than a year) is Amy Adams who with a shorter hairstyle than she has sported in recent movies is adorable as always even playing a character who is amazingly self-centered (a self-confessed ""bitch""). She brings some heft to a part that could have been written for Meg Ryan 15 years ago. (Julie Powells dialogue sounds a lot like Sally Albrights.) Stanley Tucci and Chris Messina as the respective husbands of Julia and Julie provide able albeit largely unmemorable support. Julie amp; Julia intercuts scenes from the life of Julia Child in the late 1940s and 1950s with those of Julie Powell a Queens writer who uses her love of Julia as the foundation for a blog she begins in 2002. Her goal cook every recipe in Julias cookbook (Volume 1 of Mastering the Art of French Cooking) over a period of one year and write about each success and failure. Thats 524 dishes in 365 days. In the beginning her husband loves the project - it focuses Julies energy and has the byproduct of providing him with a varied menu every day. But as the blog becomes more popular and Julie becomes obsessed with the cooking and writing the marriage buckles under the strain. Meanwhile in the middle of the 20th century Julia is learning how to cook during the period when she and her diplomat husband live in Paris. She then decides to write a cookbook for American women who want to cook French dishes - a project that would occupy her time for a decade. In order to make the frequent transitions between Julias era and Julies world less awkward Ephron imposes artificial parallels between the women and their lives. It doesnt help - the back-and-forth structure is distracting and never seems natural. To make matters worse Julia Childs story is not especially interesting. If the movie is to be believed she led a perfectly normal life and thats not the thing of which compelling cinema is made. Julies story is more engaging but even filling 50% of a two-hour slot its stretched thin. Perhaps the most disappointing thing about Julie amp; Julia is the lack of dramatic closure. In real life Julie never met Julia although the latter woman was still alive when the former completed her blog project. (According to one scene Julia was more offended than flattered by what Julie accomplished.) Although Ephron could have contrived a fictional encounter she chose not to - a decision I applaud. However the way in which the script is constructed points to something happening to bring the two together at the end and when that doesnt happen were left feeling deflated. The issue isnt that theres no meeting between Julie and Julia but that the structure of and clues within the screenplay point to this happening. I was surprised when the end credits began; it didnt seem the movie had reached a conclusion even though the major threads (Julias cookbook; Julies blog) were resolved. This is Nora Ephrons first feature since 2005s Bewitched (the less said about that the better) and she hasnt had a bona fide success in more than a decade (since 1998s Youve Got Mail). Known primarily as a chick flick purveyor Ephron slots Julie amp; Julia into that category. Its moderately successful in addressing some fairly standard issues about finding oneself through doing something one loves (in this case cooking) but its less effective in developing the sort of mouth-watering food-related experience delivered by the likes of Babettes Feast Eat Drink Man Woman and Big Night (which also featured Tucci). Despite showing plenty of meals and dishes Ephron lacks the directorial skill to stimulate the salivary glands. Arguably the best parts of Julie amp; Julia are the re-creations of segments from The French Chef and an airing of Dan Aykroyds classic parody. As good as Streep is however its still more enjoyable to watch the originals and the SNL bit can easily be found elsewhere. Consequently the best that Julie amp; Julia has to offer doesnt require seeing the movie at all.

"Julie amp; Julia | RichardRoeper.com BLOG On Camera RR YOUTUBE CHANNEL QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS Home    Movie Reviews    Julie amp; Julia Print Page Email Page Search Julie amp; Julia (2009; Rated ) B+ "" Liked the chef more than the brat."" -Richard Roeper MOVIE INFORMATION Julie amp; Julia(2009; PG-13)In theaters Friday 7 August 2009 Summary Julia Childs story of her start in the cooking profession is intertwined with blogger Julie Powells 2002 challenge to cook all the recipes in Childs first book. Genre Biography Comedy Drama RomanceDirector Nora EphronCast Meryl Streep Amy Adams The other day I watched a dead woman cook a hamburger on Public Television and it was just effin great. Clarification Its not a Zombie cooking show. The woman wasnt dead at the time. Shes dead now. But when she was with us Julia Child was a life force----a towering tittering wisecracking passionate smart immensely charming woman who delighted millions with the landmark book Mastering the Art of French Cooking and of course all those TV shows most notably ""The French Chef."" And now the equally treasured Meryl Streep pays tribute to Child with a masterful and wondrous performance in ""Julie amp; Julia"" a movie with SLIGHTLY fewer explosions than youll find in ""G.I. Joe""----but about a 1000-point edge in overall cinematic I.Q. Nora Ephron deftly volleys back and forth between the story of Julia Childs epic struggle in the 1940s and 1950s to become a chef and get her book published and blogger Julie Powells effort a half-century later to cook all 524 recipes in Childs landmark tome. Powell is played by the ever-sunshiney Amy Adams who gives a fine performance here as always even though shes saddled with playing a sweet but self-pitying type whose passion for Child sometimes makes her come across as a thirtyish version of a ""Twilight"" fan. (""Julia would NEVER do that..."") By the time her husband finally explodes at her for being so selfish and for mining every detail of their life for a blog item you want to shout ""About time you grew a pair sporto."" [SIDEBAR Powells next book reportedly details the affair she had with a close friend. Ephron said that wasnt in the movie because it happened after the time frame depicted. Even if had happened during the period chronicled in the film theres no way it would have been a part of ""Julie amp; Julia."" Audiences would have LOATHED Julie----not a good thing when shes supposed to be the heroine of the story.] From the moment Child and her husband (Stanley Tucci) arrive in Paris and she greets the locals in her trademark pitch which sounds like John Cleese doing a female character on an old ""Python"" sketch you cant help but love Streep/Child. The average-sized Streep----with the considerable help of cinematographer Stephen Goldblatt and the props team----does a remarkable job of occupying Childs giantess frame and her larger-than-life personality. Undaunted by setback after setback after setback Julia presses on with her dream of mastering French cooking and sharing her secrets with the world. In the meantime Julie is more ""daunted"" by setback after setback after setback but she too perseveres albeit with less charm and romance than her idol. (In Julies defense her story is set in Queens in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 while the bulk of Julias story is set in a storybook postwar version of Paris.) Tucci lends his dry wit and sly warmth to the role of Julias supportive husband who adores her so. Jane Lynch has a classic cameo straight out of the 1930s-screwball-comedy playbook as Julias taller wackier sister. The guy playing Julies husband is um hold on here Chris Messina whos done some good work in other stuff but is stuck here either saying ""Delicious"" as he samples Julies dishes or stomping about because shes more concerned about whats cooking in the kitchen than whats cooking elsewhere. When she deigns to make love to him hes like a grateful puppy. Adams can be heartbreakingly charming as when she says to her husband ""Are you back? Pleeeeze be back."" But this is Streeps movie every inch of the way as she hits every comedic line out of the park but never reduces Child to an impersonation or a caricature. There is genuine sadness and weariness in Julias eyes when her cookbook is rejected or when her husband tells her they have to leave her beloved Paris; there is a deep love in her expression when she gazes upon her husband. Streeps Julia Child is not a saint but she sure as hell is someone youd want to share a hundred dinners with no matter who was doing the cooking. Every time we flash forward to Julies story youre thinking More Julia less Julie and this would have been a perfect recipe. About that burger It was a ginormous hunk of meat on a big bun and Julia bathed it in ketchup and cradled it in lettuce and onions. It was so huge they had to cut it in half just to take a bite out of it. And when the burger was finished Julia and her guest chef toasted the audience with a glass of red wine. Beautiful.

ALL IMAGES ARE PROPERTY OF SONY PICTURES ENTERTAINMENT) Globe review Julia and Meryl overshadow Julie and Amy - as they should Add to ... Kate Taylor From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Thursday Aug. 06 2009 129PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 319PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Julie amp; Julia Written and directed by Nora Ephron Starring Meryl Streep Amy Adams Stanley Tucci and Chris Messina Classification PG A movie about the parallel lives of a famous cook and an unknown blogger Julie amp; Julia employs the usually reliable narrative strategy of alternating between two stories cutting from one to the other at the moment most calculated to generate suspense. You know that director Nora Ephron hasnt got the balance quite right however when we leave blogger Julie Powell at a point of great excitement - yet find we have largely lost interest in the identity of her mystery dinner guest when we return to her story. In the meantime we have been savouring meaty scenes from the life of the great Julia Child the famed American cook who helped introduce French cuisine to the United States. Child was a large personality and Meryl Streep is a great actress - the combination does rather overshadow young Amy Adams in the role of Powell the earnest disciple. And theres an irony because everybody involved here from Ephron and Streep to Childs publishers owes the real Powell a huge debt Julie is the reason the persona of that over-effusive purveyor of butter-soaked cuisine is suddenly so delightful again handing Streep a plum role and the Child estate one presumes fresh royalties. Powell has done what the most devoted fan can only dream of She has introduced her mentor to a whole new audience. It was the real Julie Powell an unhappy government clerk in New York with an unfinished novel in her bottom drawer who decided to spend a year cooking every recipe in Childs Mastering the Art of French Cooking and blogging about the experience. The blog found a loyal following and was written up in The New York Times; a book deal soon followed. This movie is based on Powells 2005 Julie and Julia 365 days 524 recipes 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen and on Childs memoir My Life in Paris . Ephrons adaptation of the story of Powells rise to fame is like some diluted version of the romantic comedies such as Youve Got Mail or Sleepless in Seattle with which she has made her reputation. The rebirth of the unfulfilled Powell through her blog seems predictable; the fight with her loving husband and his departure for a night or two on the office couch seem perfunctory. There is a really funny scene with a pot full of lobsters and the story a post-modern happily ever-after in which the democracy of the blogosphere delivers success to the deserving has a few gentle things to say about the relationship between the famous and the unknown. The aging Child who died the year before Powells book appeared is informed of the blog but proves dismissive. The film is at its best in scenes set in Europe in the 1950s - the protracted genesis of Mastering the Art provides the drama here. The wife of an American diplomat stationed in Paris Child turned to cooking because she loved eating took the Cordon Bleu course to entertain herself met up with two Parisians who were trying to write an English-language cookbook devoted to French cuisine and eventually spearheaded that project always encouraged by an adoring husband whose own career was increasingly stagnant but not uneventful. (There is a McCarthy-era scene in which Paul Child is interrogated about ""un-American activities."") It took almost a decade of work by Child and her co-authors Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholle (the latter is presented here as lazy and less involved) before the first volume of Mastering the Art of French Cooking was finally published in the United States in 1961. In the role of the irrepressible dynamo Streep produces an impersonation but not a caricature - she does a superb job of effusing over food in a way that is comic without being ridiculous. And she makes Childs energy and optimism absolutely irresistible; the movie is as snappy as those lobsters whenever shes on screen. Stanley Tucci provides an amusing and lusty foil in the role of Paul Child while Adams as Julie and Chris Messina as her patient husband Eric are left being sweet and cute on the sidelines. Quote-hungry publicists are going to hope that critics call this a movie that makes you want to eat but it made me want to shop for butter for brie for baguette - and for books not Julie amp; Julia  of course but rather both volumes of Mastering the Art of French Cooking .

After Ward Childs is basically it for point guards on the roster unless you count the inexperienced Rick Brunson. With Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell starting in the ""think big"" backcourt yesterday Childs waited patiently for his chance off the bench and he produced in a positive way in the Knicks 87-73 win over the Pacers. Childs dishing out nine assists to only two turnovers and scoring five points in 30 minutes of quality time provided a spark for the Knicks and he too got under Reggie Millers skin. The highlight was an offensive foul against Miller who knocked Childs hard to the floor and still left the Gardens favorite punching bag staring at the officials in disbelief. It was enough to ignite the Garden crowd into one of its patented obcenity-laced chants and spark the Knicks. When it was suggested to Childs that he ""out-flopped a flopper"" Childs said ""It wasnt a flop. I got hit in the jaw. It was a call he normally gets."" If the statistics hold true Childs mission was well accomplished. The Knicks were plus-four points over the Pacers with Houston and Sprewell in the backcourt plus-13 with Childs in the game and minus-three at the end with Brunson running the point.

Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday August 6 2009 725 AM Title Julie amp; Julia Well what do you know? It turns out there was an accent Meryl Streep hadnt yet tackled - and as anyone might guess she handles it with remarkable finesse.Once you see Streeps trilling bigger-than-life portrayal of Julia Child in fact youll find it impossible to imagine that anyone else could have done justice to the delightfully awkward kitchen icon.The other half of ""Julie amp; Julia"" belongs to Amy Adams who plays real-life blogger Julie Powell. Their stories are parallelled throughout as director-screenwriter Nora Ephron alternates between postwar Paris and 21st-century Queens. Powell is an adrift aspiring writer living in a cramped apartment with her husband (Chris Messina) when she decides to blog her way through Childs classic ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking."" Her goal is to attempt every recipe in a single year from soups to souffles. Meanwhile the adrift aspiring chef Child is living in France with her diplomat husband (Stanley Tucci) searching for something to do. Back and forth we go watching two talented women inch their way toward the books that made their careers. (Powells story is based on her memoir which gave the film its title.)Regrettably Ephron encourages a meringue-sweet performance from Adams who is stuck playing a role that veers too close to cloying. (She does get extra points for showing up to work every day despite the atrocious hairstyle forced upon her.) Streep on the other hand has found the ideal match for her outsized talents and digs into the challenge with undiluted glee. She makes Child simultaneously comic and poignant while Tucci provides a wisely muted foil. As for the food every dish is so lovingly portrayed that even aspic sounds appealing.There are things to quibble about throughout from the overlong running time to the uneven script. Fortunately though everyone involved understands that Streep is the most important ingredient in this recipe. Its thanks to her youll walk away satisfied while simultaneously hungry for more.eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"Julie amp; Julia - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEW Julie amp; JuliaNora Ephron whips up something wonderful in Julie amp; Julia. Bon appetit indeed.August 07 2009|Kenneth Turan FILM CRITIC""Julie amp; Julia"" does it right. A consummate entertainment that echoes the rhythms and attitudes of classic Hollywood its a satisfying throwback to those old-fashioned movie fantasies where impossible dreams do come true. And in this case it really happened. Twice.Starring Meryl Streep and Amy Adams and written and directed in her most accomplished work to date by Nora Ephron this film adroitly combines two separate stories told by two different books (the characters never meet) that are linked not only by subject but also by theme.The first is Julia Childs ""My Life in France"" a memoir by the celebrated cook teacher and writer whose ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" and accompanying ""The French Chef"" television show radically changed the American culinary landscape.The second memoir ""Julie amp; Julia"" follows writer Julie Powell as she works her way through a self-imposed quest cooking all 524 recipes in Childs book all specifically formulated for ""the servantless American cook"" in the space of one 365-day year.These two books are linked not only by Powells decision or even by the authors shared zeal for butter but also by a similarity in personality and situation. Both women are unstoppable forces searching for something worth their involvement and both find that cooking completes them makes them feel alive in ways wonderful and unforeseen.Its also worth noting that these two stories are tales so to speak of sisters doing it for themselves. Though both women have loyal and encouraging husbands (played by fine actors Stanley Tucci and Chris Messina) who are crucial to their success this is the rare Hollywood film where its the men who are the support team not the women.""Julie amp; Julia"" is very much a female coming to power story which is one of several reasons why the producers were fortunate to get Ephron to write and direct.Herself a passionate cook who told The Times John Horn ""I felt my entire life had prepared me to write this screenplay -- my obsession with food"" Ephron shares with her protagonists a deep appreciation for the pleasures of the stove. Though ""Julie amp; Julia"" is a film about love and accomplishment as well as cooking its especially animated by a genuine enjoyment of food as one of lifes warmest and most pleasing satisfactions.As felicitous as the choice of Ephron was her decision to cast Streep in the Julia Child role. No one needs to be told at this late date how formidably accomplished an actress Streep is but she outdoes herself here in a comic-dramatic role that is not only enormously funny but also trickier than it may seem at first.Thats because with her inimitable voice and unmistakable mannerisms Child was simultaneously a real person and a kind of caricature a personality so extreme its initially hard to separate the clip we see of Dan Aykroyds ""Saturday Night Live"" impersonation from the real thing.Streep makes crossing this chasm look simple easily conveying Childs phenomenal energy and relishing the contradictions of the character the way Julia herself relishes a particularly delicious sole meuniere. This is a performance to cherish and enjoy.Though the films Julie Powell sequences were shot first ""Julie amp; Julia"" opens with Julia Child arriving in France in 1948 not knowing the language or a thing about the cuisine. But to say shes an enthusiast is not to say the half of it and not content to be merely the wife of U.S. Embassy cultural attache Paul Child (Tucci) Julia searches for something to be enthusiastic about.After a failed foray into hats and the realization that eating is one of the things she does best Child enrolls in the Cordon Bleu cooking school run by the disagreeable Madame Brassart (former French Vogue editor Joan Juliet Buck). Being thrust into a class of professional men rouses her competitive spirit -- a sight gag involving chopped onions is priceless -- and thus begins the adventure leading to a chance meeting with Simone Beck (Linda Emond) and the years-long process resulting in the first modern English language guide to French cooking.Meanwhile in a universe far far away and 50 years in the future we meet a woman facing a different set of challenges. The year is 2002 and Julie Powell (Adams) is a once-promising young writer who now sits in a cubicle at the Lower Manhattan Development Corp. fielding phone calls from malcontents.Frustrated by her job and her power broker friends and encouraged by husband Eric (Messina) Julie comes up with the idea of tackling Childs recipes in her small Queens kitchen and recording her progress in the then-new arena of blogging. Like her role model she faces down obstacles and perseveres to the happy ending we feel she deserves.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESJulia Childs 100th birthday Toques off to a culinary...August 15 2012Food FYI More memories of Julia Child on her 100th birthdayAugust 15 2012Los Angeles Times Bestsellers for Nov. 1 2009November 1 2009Julia Child cookbook sales are on fireAugust 11 2009Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/reviews/movies/la-et-julie-julia7-2009aug07,0,1724703.story",200,julie&julia16,julie&julia,latimes

""Julie amp; Julia"" Movie Review -- Julie Powell was happily married nearly 30 and convinced that her life was going nowhere. Julia Child was happily married nearly 40 and convinced that her life was going nowhere. Julie amp; Julia (PG-13) Columbia (123 min.) Directed by Nora Ephron. With Meryl Streep Amy Adams. Now playing in New Jersey. STEPHEN WHITTYS RATING THREE STARS Rating note The film contains strong language adult situations and high cholesterol. But then Child began to cook. And then more than 40 years later Powell began to copy her. Slowly something wonderful began to simmer. Powell was a bored secretary when she came up with her project to spend one year cooking every recipe from Childs ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" and chronicle her efforts in a blog. Unfortunately Powell had an e-generation tendency to overshare delivering way too much information (maggoty kitchens ob-gyn appointments) and way too little novelty (trite observations about friends and coworkers). It grew even more tiresome when it became a full-fledged book. Nora Ephrons very smart movie adaptation fixes that by radically readjusting the ingredients emphasizing one taste over another. Yes we still have the comically overburdened Julie flailing about trying to make sense of her life (and a particularly difficult poached-egg recipe). But now we also have Julia as well. And thats a special delight because while Julie is sweet Julia is heroic a woman who saw what life put on her plate murmured a quick ""Bon appetit"" and then dug in. She was a winner not a whiner; a woman not a 30-ish teenager. Even more delightful is that we have Meryl Streep playing her. Of course Streep a fine mimic gets the voice -- that mad trilling call to arms -- absolutely right. But she even manages magically to get the intimidating size of the woman. (Streep is about 5-foot-6; the one time I saw the 6-foot-2-inch Child walking past me in Manhattan it was as if the Chrysler building were out for a stroll). But most of all Streep (and Ephron who wrote much of this from scratch) gets the characters genuine quiet modest strength. Child was if nothing else capable -- full of a good humor and a practicality that was a hallmark of her generation. These were the people who got things done. In a way the rewrite is not quite fair to co-star Amy Adams who plays Powell. Adams who last appeared with her mentor Streep in ""Doubt"" is ineffably sweet as Julie but her character is clearly second best a child who seems to have wandered downstairs while the grown-ups are having cognac and needs to be shooed back to bed. Even without trying her role model pushes her off the stage. Child faces the red-baiting of her State Department husband; Powell has a slight and spurious fight with hers. Child perfects recipes; Powell replicates them. Child searches for a publisher; Powell just hits ""enter."" The struggles arent exactly equal. Still you can see how Child could inspire a young woman sitting in a crummy kitchen in Queens. Its the same way she has inspired cooks of all kinds for decades and why really she inspired two old pros like Ephron and an Oscar-worthy Streep to make this movie. Child who died in 2004 at 91 is such a breath of fresh air. (Well maybe not fresh. Maybe vermouth-and-shallot scented.) She doesnt complain or explain. She loves butter and red wine and conversation and while neither she nor her husband (sweetly played by Stanley Tucci) are particularly young or beautiful theyre in love (and lust) with each other and quite content. We need more people like her. In fact we need even more of her on-screen here. If ""Julie amp; Julia"" occasionally falters its because of that ""Julie amp;"" in the title. Its ""Julia"" who truly delights and who we want seconds of. Like the food she dishes up shes warm and spicy hearty and satisfying. Everyone else is strictly an appetizer.

Media San Francisco Chronicle Julie amp; Julia Comedy-drama. Starring Meryl Streep Amy Adams Stanley Tucci and Chris Messina. Directed by Nora Ephron. (PG-13. 123 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Few movies are as delightful as ""Julie amp; Julia."" Everything youve ever liked about Meryl Streeps invention spontaneity and inspired silliness - and everything you may have ever loved about Julia Childs joy of life and singular eccentricity - come together in Streeps performance as the great American chef. Then theres the food and the films celebration of food ... and the sense of fellowship and good times that come with food ... and the lovingly re-created Paris of the 1940s and 50s ... At its best this is an abundant irresistible film. Written and directed by Nora Ephron ""Julie amp; Julia"" gives us the improbable true story of a 40-year-old woman with no previous experience who discovered her gift and her passion for cooking - and went on to become the most influential American cook of the 20th century. Along the way Ephron crafts a rare detailed cinematic portrait of a happy marriage in the depiction of Childs relationship with her husband Paul (Stanley Tucci).

Amy Adams in ""Julie amp; Julia."" Amy Adams as ""Julie Powell"" in Columbia Pictures JULIE amp; JULIA. Photo Jonathan Wenk Sony Pictures Review Julie amp; Julia celebrates good life 1 / 1 Back to Gallery In fact if ""Julie amp; Julia"" focused entirely on the ""Julia"" part it would be without question one of the best movies of the year. But theres another side to the movie the Julie Powell side. Powell is a young New Yorker who gave herself the challenge of making over the course of a single year every recipe contained in Julia Childs ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking."" You know so she could blog about it. The movie intersperses scenes of Julia Child in midcentury Paris with scenes of Julie Powell in modern-day Queens New York and after an hour or so the viewer may feel a tug of reluctance at leaving the Paris scenes and a sense of relief each time one of the New York segments is over. The reason hasnt to do with the atmosphere or location but with the character and personalities of the women. Child is a burst of joy while Powell as played by Amy Adams is a churlish ambition-driven opportunist. That wouldnt be a problem except that the movie just assumes that Powell is a sympathetic figure. Then it goes about justifying the juxtaposition of the two women by finding shallow parallels between them. In fact their differences in moral stature and achievement are staggering Julia Child passionately applies herself in an effort to do something worthwhile and finally achieves a foothold in success after 13 years of hard work and setbacks. Meanwhile Julie piggybacking on the efforts of a great woman tries to get famous by writing a blog - and succeeds inside a year. On the way to her book and movie deals she whines throws tantrums and puts her poor husband (Chris Messina) through utter hell. In one typically discordant moment Julie Powell throws live lobsters into boiling water - what a charmer - because shes too squeamish to kill them before putting them into a pot. Believe it or not that scene is played for laughs. Alas it takes longer to explain the one thing thats off about ""Julie amp; Julia"" than to explain the many things that are right about it. In truth by the time the movie is over few people will be talking about the sourness of the Julie scenes except in passing. Theyll repress them. Instead theyll be talking about Julia Child striding through a Paris open-air market towering over everyone with her great height and buoyant spirit. (Streep is little more than average height but every short extra in the world is in this movie.) And theyll be talking about the quiet moments between Julia and her kindly and supportive husband. Tucci is lovely in this. Theyll also be talking about the wonderful lunch scene with Streep and Jane Lynch as Julias sister. What a spectacle Two expert screen comedians each topping the other and working in hilarious harmony as they play these cheerful giantesses. This is fun virtuoso generous comic acting. And generosity is what ""Julie amp; Julia"" is about the generosity of the earth and the generosity of effort required to make good food; the generosity of spirit that goes into a good dinner and the generosity of investment that goes into a lifes calling. Its about the recipe for the good life how one woman finds it and how the other one couldnt even with a map. -- Advisory This movie has brief strong language and sensuality.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post What an expression of the joy of cooks and cooking ""Julie amp; Julia"" turns out to be. From the first moment Meryl Streep playing Julia Child utters ""bon appetit"" the film celebrates appetite over ambition. And while those two words might bring the first smiles in writer- director Nora Ephrons seemingly blithe always spirited comedy they are hardly the last. There are plenty of verbs to capture Ephron and her able leads feat. They have whisked stirred seared and trussed two sources -- Julia Childs ""My Life in France"" (co-authored with Alex Prudhomme) and Julie Powells best-selling ""Julie amp; Julia"" -- into a tale of two women. The latter originated as a blog. Powell who is played by Amy Adams decides she will write about her efforts to cook in 365 days all 524 recipes in Childs groundbreaking 1961 tome ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking."" Moving between Paris in the late 1940s and 50s and Queens New York in the wake of 9/11 Ephrons script links the two Js who lived in distinctly different periods. When Julie embarks on her lunatic culinary adventure she is working at a city agency processing 9/11 claims. She and mate Eric (Chris Messina) have made what Julie considers a decidedly downward move from Brooklyn to Queens. Julia on the other hand relocates upward from Washington to Paris when her husband Paul is appointed to head a U.S. Information Service office. Production designer Mark Ricker has great fun capturing the Paris that captures Julias heart. A great charm of this romantically inclined comedy is its belief in marriage. ""Julie amp; Julia"" is also Paul amp; Erics stories. Each is a partner in his mates adventure Julias study at the famed Cordon Bleu cooking school. Julies endeavors to not only conquer lobster thermidor and boeuf bourguignon but to become the writer she hoped to be. Stanley Tucci hits especially sweet notes as the career diplomat. He and Julia met in Ceylon. They traveled to China where they continued to work for the precursor to the CIA the Office of Strategic Services. ""I know I know"" Paul says again and again when his beloved is struck dumb by a delicious meal or heartbroken by great news from her sister. When Julias younger sister Dorothy visits then marries we get a glimpse of Julias Pasadena Calif. roots. Their father John McWilliams supported Sen. Joseph McCarthys efforts to flush out communists an undertaking Julia and Paul experience firsthand. Dorothy is played with nice gusto by Jane Lynch (""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" ) in a part unlike those bromance turns she does so well. Messina appeals as Eric. An archaeology magazine editor he initially digs his role as guinea pig to Julies grand experiment. But then comes the heartburn. Adams does strong work with arguably the movies toughest assignment. Julie is not a towering force but a woman about to turn 30 who feels shes lost ground. The ""ritual Cobb salad lunch"" she submits to with a clique of college ""friends"" in power suits is pure self-flagellation. Its also one of the less subtle gestures on Ephrons part. And theres something sad about the movies commentary on contemporary female friendships. Julia had them with co-author Simone Beck (played by Linda Emond); with Avis with whom she keeps a regular correspondence. For Julie female support is harder to come by. Her mother is a judgmental voice on the phone. Even best girlfriend Sarah (Mary Lynn Rajskub) seems not quite up for the task. Julies great if imagined friend turns out to be Julia Child. Now a word or two about the food. Stephen Goldblatt shoots the dishes for maximum craving. Its a fine discomfort to sit in a theater as a buttery browned sole meuniere is boned tableside. And a few more words not about food but sound. Julia Childs voice is musical. And it doesnt seem to matter if her delightful warble comes from the real deal (via a YouTube search). Or from Dan Aykroyd on ""Saturday Night Live."" (Bravo to Ephron for taking on that indelible parody of the titan of the kitchen.) Or from Streep who disappears into the endearing trill of it with well-suited bonhomie. The blog Julie writes became a book which in turn became this movie. That trajectory fits perfectly our Horatio Alger hankerings. Yet the richest point in this vivacious but also subtle pleasure is that we can cook our souffle and eat it too.

"Julie amp; Julia Too many cooks | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesJulie amp; Julia Too many cooksMeryl Streep completely captures the gangly six-foot-two woman who changed how America cooks. But the films second story line seems like a distraction.Meryl Streep as Julia Child in Julie amp; Julia. Streeps own mother ""only had one cookbook and it was called The I Hate to Cook Book and she used to say `If its not done in 20 minutes its not dinner.  (SUBMITTED PHOTO)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Aug. 6 2009 (out of 4)Starring Meryl Streep Amy Adams Stanley Tucci and Chris Messina. Directed by Nora Ephron. 123 minutes. At midnight tonight at AMC Yonge-Dundas opening Friday in major theatres. PGMeryl Streep not just playing Julia Child but seemingly possessed by her discovers food in Paris in the early going of Julie amp; Julia and attacks a hunk of sole crisped in sizzling butter with the kind of pure sensual joy usually reserved for pursuits of a more private nature.Streep completely captures the gangly six-foot-two woman who changed how America cooks mimicking her attacks on both syllables and chicken carcasses her breathless warble and the way she used her whole body as a punctuation mark arms flailing.Child was often imitated but Streep lets us see her jubilant soul.Thats the best part of Julie amp; Julia. But the side dish that accompanies Child is a rom-com that seems to belong in another movie.Article Continued BelowWriter-director Nora Ephron (Sleepless in Seattle) has melded two foodie books into one story blogger Julie Powells Julie amp; Julia and My Life in France by Julia Child with Alex Prudhomme. More than 50 years and a continent separate New York civil servant Powell from Child who ends up living in Paris in 1948 with husband Paul when he is posted there with the foreign service.As Powell a failed novelist who is looking for a purpose Amy Adams is determined to cook all 524 recipes in Childs Mastering the Art of French Cooking in one year in 2002 and blog daily about the process.She idolizes Child and talks about her as more than a mentor; shes a soul mate. Whether Julies marriage can survive her frequent meltdowns crying jags and growing self-absorption is another matter. But there is something so likeable about Adams (teamed again with Streep after sharing the screen in Doubt although they are never together in Julie amp; Julia) that we are willing to overlook the undercooked edges of her story.So if its not all domestic bliss for Julie and husband Eric (Chris Messina) things in the Child household are hotter than a Scotch bonnet pepper.The onscreen chemistry Streep had with Stanley Tucci in The Devil Wears Prada takes a decidedly different turn here where he plays Julias devoted husband Paul. The two are giddy as teenagers happily devouring what Julia learns to cook when she enrols in lecole Le Cordon Bleu then lustily tumbling into bed after lunch before each returns to class and office.Ephrons mistake in stitching these two stories together is to assume that since both deal with the same subject - Julia Child - they should blend effortlessly. The Child story gets bogged down in smallish details and it feels like a letdown when the movie skips to 2002 and Julie. We want to stay in France and watch Julia truss ducks and swoon over fresh oysters feeding the choicest bits of her meal to Paul as they smoke and down martinis in cafes.""Is there anything better than butter?"" Julie asks as she drops hunk after hunk into a sizzling pan.Probably not. Julia certainly agreed; you can never have too much butter. But another kitchen saying comes to mind too many cooks spoil the broth.

Its a light and entertaining treat with winning performances sharp writing and some happy surprises. For foodies the film will be a particular delight. Mouth-watering delicacies are artfully presented and the ""secret"" ingredient is an unending supply of butter. MORE 5 Fun Facts about Amy Adams Learn all about the Julie star WATCH Meryl Streep talks about eating on the job Julia is Julia Child (Meryl Streep) author of Mastering the Art of French Cooking and an early TV chef whose distinctive blend of culinary instruction and gastronomic gusto was both beloved and parodied. Julie is Julie Powell (Amy Adams) a thirtysomething writer at a professional crossroads. She has a bureaucratic day job but by night she embarks in 2002 on a plan to prepare all 524 recipes in Childs seminal 1961 cookbook over the course of a year and to blog about it. The film -- based on Powells 2005 book Julie amp; Julia and Childs 2006 memoir My Life in France-- traces a crucial period for Child just after World War II when she and her American diplomat husband Paul (Stanley Tucci) are living happily in Paris. Intent on spending her days productively Child studies cooking at the renowned Le Cordon Bleu. But the undertaking that changes her life is the eight-year process of writing an exhaustive collection of recipes and culinary instructions intended for Americans who are ""servant-less"" and eager to whip up tasty French fare. Streep plays Julia Child to perfection. She nails Childs distinctive vocal cadence loping gait awkward gestures and above all her voluble enthusiasm. Streeps turn as the sprightly TV chef is not only a wondrous impersonation but an intelligent and respectful portrayal. Adams performance is more low-key. She plays someone not as intrinsically likable as Child. But because Adams is a consistently engaging actress its hard not to feel some measure of warmth toward the character. Julies supportive husband Eric (a charming Chris Messina) suggests the blog idea and figures prominently in her year-long quest just as Paul unfailingly encourages Julia and predicts that her book will ""change the world."" This is writer/director Nora Ephrons funniest and most appealing film. She melds the parallel stories set several decades apart and creates a narrative that is at times enchanting although occasionally slightly forced. Though not an all-out feast Julie amp; Julia is spiced with plenty of humor and affection. The experience is well worth relishing.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor August 7 2009 Save for later Saved Meryl Streep protrays chef Julia Childs in Columbia Pictures ""Julie amp; Julia"" which opens nationwide Friday. Columbia Pictures/Sony/Jonathan Wenk/AP          View Caption In 2003 the Monitor interviewed self-taught chef and blogger Julie Powell shown here making an open-faced Piperade omelette who spent a year cooking every recipe in Julia Childs Mastering the Art of French Cooking. Melanie Stetson Freeman / The Christian Science Monitor/FILE          View Caption About video ads View Caption of You dont have to know who Julia Child is in order to appreciate Meryl Streeps bravura comic performance in writer-director Nora Ephrons ""Julie and Julia"" but it helps. This actress who for most of her career specialized in roles of the utmost gravitas has in recent years unleashed her inner goofball - and were all the better for it.Im thinking not so much of ""Mamma Mia"" which was less a performance than a vaudeville turn but rather ""Adaptation"" and ""A Prairie Home Companion."" Comedy makes Streep seem ecstatically down to earth.Julia Child on the other hand always came across as larger than life. At six-feet two-inches and gawky she didnt so much stand as teeter. With a stentorian voice pitched falsetto-high except for occasional runs down the octave Child was perhaps the least likely star in the history of television. Although I didnt care about cooking I used to watch her show ""The French Chef"" as a kid because I got such a kick out of her especially when she would accidentally drop onto the floor some ingredient like a piece of veal and then bemused briskly wipe it off and plunk it into the pan. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Ephrons movie is really two movies The first and by far the best is drawn from Childs posthumously completed 2006 memoir ""My Life in France"" and is all about how at 36 stationed in France in 1948 with her US Foreign Service employee husband Paul (the excellent Stanley Tucci) Child found her calling becoming the first woman to graduate from the snooty male-dominated Cordon Bleu before going on to co-write the classic ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" - the book that yanked America out of the processed food era (for a time anyway alas). Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review Julie and Julia The other film set in 2002 is about the real-life Julie Powell (Amy Adams) who works a boring stressful job for an organization involved in rebuilding the World Trade Center. Then she has brainstorm. In her off hours she will change her life by cooking all 524 of the recipes in ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" in 365 days and blog about her experiences. A blog pioneer she turns her writings into a book ""Julie and Julia My Year of Cooking Dangerously"" proving once again that the way to a publishers heart is through its stomach. (As the film shows the Monitor interviewed Ms. Powell in 2003 when she was about halfway through Ms. Childs book.)Ephron intercuts these two womens lives in fairly simpleminded fashion. The idea I suppose is that Julia (as I will now refer to the great lady) is the avatar and Julie the acolyte. They are linked across space and time. Both women turn their lives around through cooking and both have adoring husbands who reap the bliss not to mention the boeuf bourguignon.Theres something blandly but also pushily inspirational about all this especially the Julie parts. Its like being put through a candy-colored motivational seminar. Change your life Find something you love to do and do itThe bliss factor in this movie is so high that Ephron has to work hard particularly with Julie to get any conflict going. Julies husband Eric (Chris Messina) who edits an archaeology magazine is by any measure a saint and so of course there must be a scene where he protests ""I am not a saint."" But except for the ever-present bottle of Tums on his nightstand he seems to be in hog heaven throughout. Its never really explained how this couple on a meager income can afford all these fancy meals but at least Ephron didnt take the low road and turn Eric into a bank robber or something. (Messina according to the press notes was chosen for the role in part because he ""simply looked good chewing a mouthful of Lobster Thermidor."")Amy Adams is a charming performer but her role not to mention her performance just doesnt measure up to Streeps. I wish Ephron had jettisoned the Julie stuff altogether and made ""Julia"" instead (especially since the two women never meet). On the other hand what actress in her right mind would want to go up against Streep in all her goony glory? (Well Jane Lynch in a wonderful cameo as Julias sky-high sister does.) One can make a case though I wouldnt that what Streep is doing here is more impersonation than performance. But who cares about such fine distinctions when the work is so enjoyable?Ephron does one very difficult thing very well She makes absolutely believable a genuinely happy marriage. Theyre so happy together that Ephron drags in Julias childlessness and Pauls McCarthy-era political woes as party poopers but her hearts not in it. In their smitten silliness Julia and Paul are made for each other in the same way that Shakespearean lovers (and clowns) sometimes are. There are many things wrong with ""Julie and Julia"" but if youre looking to get hitched you wont find a better booster. Just make sure that one of you can cook.

Her 1961 bestseller ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" saved our society from a dismal diet of TV dinners casseroles and Jell-O salads. (At least it saved the other 49 states.) When she went on public TV the following year narrating her cleaver work in that lofty sing-song voice America fell in love. Streep nails Childs mannerisms of course but so much more -- her sincerity and warmth her gentleness and charm her patrician air and common touch. She is the one reason to see the film and if you close your eyes during the chapters when she is off camera you will have a jolly time. Unfortunately there is much more to the movie. Amy Adams Streeps co-star from last years ""Doubt"" plays Julie Powell a New York cubicle drone who set out to cook her way through Childs treatise preparing all 524 recipes in 365 days and blogging about the experience. Writer/director Nora Ephron wrings obvious irony out of the contrast between the womens lives. The Child sequences set in gauzy gorgeous 1950s French locales are little gems of grace and glamour. Her husband (Stanley Tucci demonstrating a nice chemistry with Streep) is suave and adoring. Their apartments look like anterooms in Versailles. Powell circa 2002 lives above a skeevy pizzeria in Queens and every day is a struggle. Her girlfriends are shallow successes who broker multimillion-dollar deals on their phones at lunch (and all eat dull Cobb salads). Her job is dismal She administers federal payouts to people victimized by the 9/11 attacks and angry callers yell at her nonstop. Ephron presents Powells average lower-middle-class existence as if it were a life-size bad-taste exhibit -- George Segal sculptures in banal living color. Powells one blessing is a limitlessly supportive husband (Chris Messina) who suggests that she shake off her blues by combining the two subjects shes passionate about -- cooking and writing. Her blog catches on and soon shes microfamous. JULIE amp; JULIA  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for brief strong language and some sensuality. So we get two women leading parallel lives never meeting. Ephron made a similar story structure work for ""Sleepless in Seattle"" with a pair of intriguing characters emotionally linked to each other struggling to connect. Here we get one charismatic lady and a mouseburger with no real bond. Neither speaks in the cute zingers that Ephron characters normally employ (and the biggest laugh is swiped from the fantasy novelist Douglas Adams). Neither travels a great dramatic arc. Childs chief antagonist is a snippy functionary at the Cordon Bleu cooking school. The worst things that happen to Powell are (spoiler alert) an overcooked boeuf bourguignon and a tiff with her husband that occurs only so there can be a last-act reconciliation. With such ingredients how do you dramatize two women cooking and writing about cooking? Ephron makes the kitchen scenes sensually alluring -- the film is a eulogy to veal stock pork fat sausage organ meat demiglace and stinky cheese. French cuisine is an art and she presents it artfully; the film could be subtitled ""The Joy of Cooking."" As for the writing no one has ever made that drudgery look interesting onscreen; neither can Ephron. The story cries out for a tricky device a Charlie Kaufman fantasy sequence where Julia enters Julies imagination and leads her on a tour of Wonka-esque castles of goose liver pate. Or an ""Iron Chef"" showdown. Something. But Ephrons approach is clumpingly literal and structurally dull. Ten minutes of Julia cut. Ten minutes of Julie cut. As in Ephrons last movie 2005s ""Bewitched"" which had Nicole Kidman playing Samantha the ethereal witch and Will Ferrell playing Jack the earthbound movie star ""Julie amp; Julia"" never works its characters into a single coherent narrative. The film feels like two stories fighting to coexist in the same space. Loved the first course hated the second.

Email| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + ""Julie amp; Julia is the easiest thing Nora Ephron has ever done with a movie. Theres not much to argue with. Half the film is spent with Meryl Streep as Julia Child in France in 1949. Half is spent 50 years later with Amy Adams as Julie Powell a Texan living in Queens who devotes a year (and a blog) to exploring the recipes from the tome Child spent a decade completing ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking.Ephron has adapted two memoirs Childs ""My Life in France and Powells ""Julie amp; Julia 365 Days 524 Recipes 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen. And the movie shes built out of them is more than a tale of two women (although it is certainly that). Its a tale of two different ages for women. The movie is lighter than that sounds. Ephron doesnt make dissertations. She makes ""Youve Got Mail.So the movie glides for more than an hour like butter in a hot skillet. But it doesnt glide witlessly. We jump back and forth between France where Child is the 36-year-old wife of Paul Child (Stanley Tucci) a Foreign Service officer and New York where Powell lives in a cute apartment above a pizzeria with her husband Eric (Chris Messina).The movie begins with neither woman really knowing what to do with herself. Child takes French classes learns to play bridge tries hat making. None of it suits her. She winds up trying to enroll in the Cordon Bleu culinary school over the objections of an imperious headmistress who once Child is accepted wishes her nothing but ill. These scenes of this giant vaguely slouchy American woman (Child stood 6 foot 2) towering over tiny meticulous men at a counter are a riot. One of her goals is to master the art of the minced onion. She sets her knife to dozens which gives Tucci an opportunity to do some tickling pinpoint slapstick upon seeing and presumably smelling the eye-watering aroma that a pitchers mound of chopped onions produces.This is blissful moviemaking. Much of the pleasure we have in watching it comes from seeing Tucci and obviously Streep connect. But its also the effortlessness Ephron reveals in bringing it all together. There could have been something cartoonish about Streep who usually appears to be standing on a box to approximate Childs height. But beneath each of these scenes between Streep and Tucci and Streep and the women playing her French coauthors of ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking (Linda Emond and Helen Carrey) and her sister (Jane Lynch) between Streep and the vegetables playing the food is a deep abiding joy. Its not just the onions that bring a tear to the eye. The image of Streeps china-plate face topped with Childs curled red hair is automatically amusing. But she sings in Childs congested falsetto with an uncanny blend of phlegm and melody. Its Child in the key of Streep. (""What could this mean? she intones poring over an entry in a Larousse dictionary.) Ephron expresses a loud vote of confidence in her stars interpretation when she sits the Powells down on the sofa to laugh at Dan Aykroyds ""Saturday Night Live version of Child. The director is showing us the difference between inspired sketch comedy and actorly soul.People who knew or worshiped Child will question some of the movies details. Did she and Paul for instance really have this much sex? Was he this romantic? (""Wheres my big sprig? Paul says to his wife.) But that misses the larger point of these scenes. When in an American movie do regular people have that much sex? Plus - and this is important - Stanley Tucci is very sexy.Ephron understands this marriage this woman her friendships the hassles not only of finishing a massive book but getting it published. Ephron doesnt seem to find the same fulfillment in her movies modern New Yorker. Powells decision to start a blog stems from frustration with her job at the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation taking calls from people waiting for money after 9/11. Shes not the go-getter her friends are. Theres a funny restaurant scene between Powell and some girlfriends whom she dislikes seeing (""Ritual cobb salad. Dreading. Dreading. Dreading). Shes a dolphin. The girlfriends are sharks. One of them writes a pitying profile of her for New York magazine.I imagine part of Ephrons attraction to Powell as a character is that shes as whimsically old-fashioned in some ways as Ephrons other heroines. Powell cooks from Childs books in pearls for one thing. The spiky pouty altogether marvelous Mary Lynn Rajskub plays Powells best friend but youd be forgiven for wondering whether her true cosmic sisters are any of the women Meg Ryan has played in Ephrons other movies. There is as much tenderness and truth about friendship in this half of the movie as there is the other. But the joy of cooking is replaced here by the stress of it. Killing a lobster boning a duck Were too wimpy for that.A few people have worried that Adamss half of the movie isnt as lively or as brightly lit as Streeps (it isnt) - or that Adams isnt Streep. But it isnt that the Adams half suffers from Adams not being Streep. Its that Julie suffers (as all American cooks do) from not being Julia. And this is why the Powell parts of the film work. Its Ephrons way of coming to terms with a real consequence of post-feminism. Powell is a woman in a job she hates who finds a source of liberation doing something certain liberated women still see as oppressive housework.She turns to Childs book partly as therapy partly as anthropology. Cooking used to be about cooking but in so many ways its became about politics and the politics loosely start to take their toll on Powells marriage. Powells loving husband having been trained to accept her as a professional equal now has to learn to take his wifes kitchen work seriously. Paul Child is just as fully evolved but free of any angst over his wifes success. Hes rooting for her.Ephron works best when telling tandem stories. The paramours-to-be in ""When Harry Met Sally. . . ""Sleepless in Seattle and ""Youve Got Mail talked and typed their way into idealized romances (gallingly so in the case of ""Youve Got Mail). This time the two halves dont meet physically or philosophically. Powells project becomes a media sensation but rumor has it that Child finds it frivolous and doesnt approve (she didnt). So this might be the first of Ephrons romantic duplexes to culminate in heartbreak. It also might be the first that manages to comment on itself. The unbearable lightness of some of Ephrons moviemaking finally meets the sting of her essays. Ephron has been guilty of frivolity too. But in ""Julie amp; Julia she doesnt merely concede that food is life. She celebrates it.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation.

""Julie amp; Julia"" follows a womans quest to cook everything in a Child cookbook.By Carrie Rickey Inquirer Movie CriticPosted August 07 2009Meryl Streep is saucy as Julia Child in Julie amp; Julia an irresistible account of the American who taught her countrywomen to cook a la FranASSaise. And who 40 years later inspired the foundering Julie Powell (Amy Adams at her most winsome) to find her moorings by cooking all 524 recipes in Mastering the Art of French Cooking - and blogging about it.Like Nora Ephrons captivating film Streeps performance is haute cuisine disguised as comfort food a complex preparation yielding effects both broadly entertaining and subtly moving.Bewigged and booted to resemble the formidable figure who stood 6-foot-2 Streep has jolly fun channeling her inner Child her piping voice swooping and whooping across the Atlantic and back.In losing herself in the larger-than-life Julia awkward except when wielding whisk like scepter Streep physically conveys the transformation and triumph of a lost woman who finds her vocation. She is transcendent.Yes Julie amp; Julia is a double portrait of women who discover their power in whipping shallot reduction and wine into submission. But its also a movie about food as sex (think of prep as the foreplay) about marriage friendship and those recipes for personal and domestic happiness that dont come in books.Even if you dont give a shiitake mushroom about food theres much to savor in this lively comedy with dramatic aftertastes.Intercutting scenes from the lives of both figures (gleaned from Childs My Life in France and Powells Julie and Julia 365 Days 524 Recipes 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen the movie spans more than a decade in Childs career but only a year in Powells.Ephron often jumps between parallel narrative tracks that ultimately converge. Previously she did this in her screenplay for Rob Reiners When Harry Met Sally . . . and for her own Sleepless in Seattle and Youve Got Mail. If the two-track structure works less successfully in Jamp;J its because a) the tracks dont converge and b) Julia is a fully formed figure and Julie an unfinished woman.Still there are piquant contrasts between Child who moved from the States to Paris in 1948 and Powell who moved from Manhattan to Queens in 2002.Child who had always worked followed her husband Paul (Stanley Tucci brilliant and wry) to his State Department posting in Paris. She is a stoic looking for meaningful work. She greets adversity with a shrug and a smile. When life hands her a lemon she makes lemon-caper sauce.Powell a promising Amherst grad who believes she is destined for better things than working in a 9/11 relief agency worries that she has not achieved enough. She greets adversity with a whine and a whimper. While Adams is superb something about Powells moaning takes a little of the air out of Ephrons souffle.Julia cooks because she is a sensualist and food gives her pleasure second only to that of sex. Julie cooks because cooking gives her a measure of control over her disordered and disappointing life.In these contrasts Ephron gently implies the difference between the pioneer and the settler. Still the way Ephron structures her unapologetic work of heroine-worship shows how Julia inspires Julie - and how Julia and Paul Childs marriage inspires us all.Atmospherically shot by cinematographer Stephen Goldblatt the film is even more beautifully cast and presented.Streep and Tucci (reunited from The Devil Wears Prada) perform a comic duet with timing and gestures as impeccable as singers in a Mozart opera. Adams and Chris Messina (as Powells husband Eric) are as nicely paired as toast and marmalade.Frances Sternhagen is a hoot as Joy of Cooking scribe Irma Rombauer ditto Jane Lynch as Julias rangy sister Dorothy.Ephron who has not had a success since Youve Got Mail achieves a perfect balance of look and sound. From Alexandre Desplats puckish score to Mark Rickers lived-in art direction to Ann Roths unshowy shirtmaker dresses the elements serve to develop rather than distract from the characters.Ephron is an astute observer of how technology reshapes social intercourse. She made one of the first films about e-mail Youve Got Mail; Jamp;J may be the first about blogging.Read about culinary consultant Susan Spungen who grew up in Huntingdon Valley and was food editor of Martha Stewart Living magazine for a dozen years and try your hand at the recipe for Boeuf Bourguignon.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com Read her blog Flickgrrl at http//www.philly.com/philly/blogs/flickgrrl/ Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""http//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> comments powered by Disqus Commenting policy | Comments FAQ FEATURED ARTICLESApothecary gardens fuel farm-to-medicine-cabinet movementTiffany Trump and Naomi Biden graduate Penn dad and granddad looking onPowerball fever Jackpot rises to 900 millionMoreDe Mazia Art Brings 2.38 MillionLeader Of Jbm Sentenced To Life Aaron Jones Was Convicted Of Conspiring To Distribute 100 Million In Cocaine.

Share Tweet Simultaneously adapting Julia Childs autobiography My Life In France and Julie Powells blog-turned-memoir Julie amp; Julia Nora Ephrons Julie amp; Julia is two movies in one. Thats one more movie than it needs to be. One portrays Childs self-discovery through cooking. The other focuses on Powells attempt to spend a year preparing all the recipes in Childs co-authored 1961 breakthrough Mastering The Art Of French Cooking a cookbook that made classic French dishes accessible to ""the servantless American cook."" The first is a charming story of a woman finding a calling in a time and place when women werent generally thought to need callings. The second is an accidental dissection of Internet-enabled 21st-century narcissism rendered in broad strokes and easy punchlines. Meryl Streep thoughtfully plays Child as a passionate woman with an easy laugh and an outsized personality to match her looming frame. Following her diplomat husband Paul (Stanley Tucci) on assignment to Paris Child struggles to find an outlet for the passion not directed toward her loving marriage. She soon follows her palate to Le Cordon Bleu where she struggles to overcome the perception that shes merely dabbling. Ephron tells Childs story with a lot of love and little urgency letting small developments in the long creation of Art Of French Cooking set the pace as Streep and Tucci create an enviable vision of domestic compatibility. Her story alternates Godfather Part II style with a depiction of Powells blog project begun as an attempt to find a creative outlet beyond her job at the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation in the days after 9/11. Discovering that her innate charm has limits Amy Adams plays Powell as a monstrously self-absorbed woman who--even overlooking the ruins of the World Trade Center--sees her friends professional success as a cosmic slight against her. Once the blog becomes her focus she taps away happily--accompanied by Youve Got Mail-style voiceover--as the Internet starts to pay attention to her quirks. She isnt the sort of woman who grew up wanting to be Julia Child. Shes the sort who grew up wanting to be a Nora Ephron heroine and Ephrons attempts to rhyme the two stories only makes one look shallow by comparison.

That ought to be enough for one movie and theres more handsome settings (the City of Light regaining its prewar lustrousness) midlife romance (Stanley Tucci is Julias charmingly ardent husband Paul) and foodie porn (brie chocolate cream pie and beurre blanc sauce in lascivious close-ups). Strangely though there isnt enough for one movie and the first clue to why lurks in the titles ampersand a sort of linguistic duct tape holding together two stories that never really function as one. ENLARGE Meryl Streep as Julia Child in ""Julie amp; Julia"" Columbia Pictures The Julie story intercut with Julias takes place in New York half a century later and involves a real-life blogger Julie Powell who is played by Amy Adams. A bright woman doing dull office work in the depressing aftermath of 9/11 Julie sets out to cook in the space of one year all 524 recipes in ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" the landmark book that Julia wrote with Louisette Bertholle and Simone Beck. Julies intention is to write a blog about her culinary adventures but the blog leads to a popular book of her own published in 2005 that provides half of the films structure though much less than half its substance. The parallels are intriguing at first. Two women happily married and blissfully obsessed by food follow their bliss as they seek to define themselves in love and work. (Ms. Ephrons alter ego in ""Heartburn"" was a food writer played by Ms. Streep.) And the early scenes in Paris are so enjoyable that youre set to go along with whatever may come. (The cinematographer was Stephen Goldblatt.) Ms. Streep starts off with huge and affectionate energy--the unworldly warble of Julias birdcall voice precedes the first glimpse of her towering physique--and never relents. (To help the star measure up to her character who stood 6 feet 2 inches tall the movie surrounds Ms. Streep with shorter actors and scaled-down props. One scene in which Julias feet overflow a Parisian bed looks like ""The Incredible Shrinking Woman"" in reverse.) The remarkable thing about the Julia segments given Ms. Streeps daring flirtations with caricature is how full and affecting they prove to be. Yes Julias windmill arms are outlandish; so is her awkward stentorian French and her religious belief in the miracle of butter. Yet shes an endearing figure a woman who digests the life around her with enormous gusto while shes breaking the gender barrier at a Cordon Bleu cooking class or much later after fame has struck digests with incredulity her husbands advice that she ought to be on TV. Mr. Tuccis Paul plays a subordinate role in the story but his dry wit and calm love are perfect counterpoints to the intensity of Julias enthusiasms. (The film includes a bit of Dan Aykroyds deathless send-up of Julia Child on ""Saturday Night Live."") The Julie segments though are pallid by comparison--dollops of margarine that barely hint at butter. Theyre agreeable enough at least until Julie and her husband Eric (Chris Messina) fall into banal wrangling over the emotional cost of her new career. And Ms. Adams is appealing as always. (""Are you back?"" Julie asks with lovely guilelessness when Eric reappears after briefly leaving her. ""Please be back."") Yet those segments arent very interesting despite a pervasive sense of calculation--Julies plan for her blog sounds like a movie treatment--so they grow constantly more intrusive to the end which is notable only for its clumsiness. The joys of the Julia parts are cumulative and addictive. The Julie parts keep forcing us to go cold turkey. Cold Souls Paul Giamatti has made a specialty of playing tortured characters so its easy to see why he wanted to do ""Cold Souls."" He plays an actor--named Paul Giamatti--who suffers from severe soul-sickness until he comes upon Soul Storage a mysterious high-tech company that extracts spiritual essences and stores them cryogenically. Mr. Giamatti is the best reason to see the film a first feature by Sophie Barthes; his on-screen version of himself goes from soulful to soulless--and then soulful again--with the greatest of unease and hes entertaining in either phase. The second best reason is Andrij Parekhs cinematography. His formal compositions are haunting yet his style is unusually fluid and full of surprises. The filmmakers style on the other hand feels derivative and self-enchanted as if tossing off clever notions were the equivalent of working them out. ENLARGE David Strathairn as Dr. Flinstein and Paul Giamatti as himself in ""Cold Souls"" Samuel Goldwyn Films The notion of a soulectomy certainly qualifies as a promising comedy premise; never mind that the high-tech company in question bears a marked resemblance to Lacuna Inc. the outfit that erased unwanted memories from clients brains in Charlie Kaufmans script for ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."" And its a pleasant touch that Giamattis soul sitting on the bottom of a transparent cylinder turns out to resemble a chickpea. But it comes as a bit of a letdown when the extractionist Dr. Flintstein (David Strathairn) shrugs off the question of whether the soul is immortal by saying he doesnt have a clue. And even though Mr. Giamatti is quite funny as the newly evacuated actor playing ""Uncle Vanya"" without the burden of human emotion you may find yourself wondering what kind of artist would want to shed his soul in the first place; its not as if hes popping a Zoloft that will wear off. The more elaborate the plot becomes the sillier it gets. In search of his soul which he comes to miss but which has gone missing Giamatti travels to St. Petersburg where a thuggish Russian is trafficking in illicit souls for export and trying to score those of American movie stars for import; his extremely silly wish list includes Johnny Depp Robert Redford and Al Pacino. The nicest development in this pseudosolemn nonsense is a growing attraction between Giamatti and a drug mule of sorts named Nina--she smuggles souls inside her body past customs agents at American airports and shes played beautifully by the Russian actress Dina Korzun. Giamatti and Nina arent soul mates you understand; theyre just drawn to each other like regular people. G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra The folks at Paramount wouldnt screen ""G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra"" for critics--they must love the movie so much they want to keep it to themselves. But why do I have to see it to review it? People debate the merits of movies they havent seen all the time--especially on the message boards of the Web where vast numbers of fanboys apprentice fanatics and professional grousers turn an endless supply of baseless assumptions into groundless conclusions. Watch a street chase sequence from ""G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra."" Video courtesy of Paramount Pictures. At first I felt shut out but then I realized I was missing the point of a double blessing. Paramount has spared me the pain of sitting through another military-toy epic (the recent ""Transformers"" sequel having been a near-death experience) and the studio has set me free to reach my own conclusions--not quite groundless but close--on the basis of the ""G.I. Joe"" trailer. The first thing that happens in the trailer involves the Eiffel Tower which is hit by a missile and makes a splash by falling into the Seine. I dont like movies that trash the Eiffel Tower although I loved ""The Lavender Hill Mob"" in which Alec Guinnesss mild-mannered bank clerk smuggles gold bars out of England by turning them into Eiffel Tower paperweights. The second thing involves an actor intoning voice-over ""We have never faced a threat like this. A team is being assembled. Theyre the best operatives in the world. When all else fails we dont."" Even apart from the actor pronouncing ""assembled"" as ""assimbled"" the speech suggests a sound clip from an early rehearsal of a junior-high-school pageant. I dont like movies with bad actors reading dumb lines. Most of all I dont like vast industrial productions based on toys I never played with as a kid (although the first ""Transformers"" was actually good fun). When I wrote a review suggesting that the sequel would hasten the end of civilization a reader emailed me to say ""I have more than 700 Transformer toys and you dont know . . . "" Thats as far as I read since what I did know is that he was right. I am no more qualified to judge the details of these toy-based monstrosities than a toy critic--there are toy critics arent there?--would be qualified to review ""Casablanca."" (Though a battery-powered Rick puffing real smoke might be collectible.) Nonetheless I insist on my right to say that ""G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra"" will also hasten the end of civilization and may well be as dreadful as its said to be by countless online blatherers who exactly like me havent seen a single frame of it on a big screen. These days not seeing is believing. DVD FOCUS Adaptation (2002) Meryl Streep is the writer Susan Orlean in this one-of-a-kind comedy about another real-life writer Charlie Kaufman--hes played brilliantly by Nicolas Cage--struggling to do a screen adaptation of ""The Orchid Thief"" a particularly dense and discursive book written by Ms. Orlean. Chris Cooper plays the books subject John Laroche a smart scruffy and passionate poacher of rare orchid species. Ms. Streep and Mr. Cooper deserve one another and thats meant as high praise for both. The script was written by Mr. Kaufman who shares credit with his brother Donald Kaufman. The director was Spike Jonze. Vanya on 42nd Street (1994) ""Cold Souls"" starts with a sequence that could pass for a homage to this last film directed by Louis Malle--Paul Giamatti in rehearsal as Vanya the role played here by Wallace Shawn. The production grew out of Malles collaboration with Mr. Shawn and Andre Gregory in a series of informal restagings mostly for friends of Chekhovs ""Uncle Vanya"" as translated by David Mamet. If you want to be literal about it the process on screen is an actors workshop but literalness cant describe the hypnotic ease with which the actors assume then shed then reinhabit their roles. Toy Story 2 (1999) Against most odds the sequel turned out to be at least as wonderful as Pixars 1995 original--maybe more so. The heroes as before are Woody (Tom Hanks) a pull-string sheriff with the loose-limbed eccentricity of Ray Bolger in ""The Wizard of Oz"" and Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) a lantern-jawed space ranger struggling with the realities of his existence--hes not really an intrepid galactic explorer but a plastic plaything manufactured in Taiwan. This time Woody is stolen by an unscrupulous toy dealer after Andy the boy who owns him goes off to summer camp. --Joe Morgenstern Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Photo Credit Columbia Pictures / Sony advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The true stories of chef Julia Child and the blogger she inspired BOTTOM LINE Warm and fluffy with a standout turn by Streep as the lovably dotty Child. CAST Meryl Streep Amy Adams Stanley Tucci Chris Messina LENGTH 203 Butter that rich but simple staple lies at the heart of every great dish according to ""Julie amp; Julia"" a salty-sweet movie in which a young blogger finds inspiration in the recipes of Julia Child. Meryl Streep as Child is this films butter; everything else is garnish. Affectionately written and directed by Nora Ephron working from both Childs memoir ""My Life in France"" and the blog-turned-bestseller ""Julie amp; Julia"" the film juxtaposes the biographies of two women who find purpose and meaning in food. Childs story however proves to be the more engaging. advertisement | advertise on newsday Thats partly because she faced the sexism and conformity of the 1950s while laboring over her still-iconic book ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking."" And of course theres Streep incarnating Child to perfection the yodeling voice the tottering height (6 feet 2 inches) the general daffiness that made her television show ""The French Chef"" such a hoot. And thanks to Stanley Tucci as Childs ever-encouraging husband Paul ""Julie amp; Julia"" also serves up a tender even amorous love story. Amy Adams has less to work with as Julie Powell an unfulfilled office drone living in Queens whose bland husband (Chris Messina) suggests she start a cooking blog. Its still intact at blogs.salon.com complete with cutesy punctuation ( as well as ?) and words like ""ugh."" Nevertheless Powells attempt to make all 536 recipes in Childs famous book gains such a following that the blog itself becomes a book (and as the movie wryly notes a movie). Powells story while inspirational seems slightly trivial. Before her death in 2004 Child said she found the blog somewhat of a gimmick; audiences may feel the same way.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Aug. 6 2009 102 PM Julie amp; Julia Meryl Streep is amazingly good as Julia Child. By Dana Stevens After youve seen Julie amp; Julia come back and listen to our Spoiler Special discussion of all the tasty tidbits You can also click hereto download the MP3 file or youll find this and dozens of other Spoiler Specials in our iTunes podcast feed here. Meryl Streep as Julia Child in Julie amp; Julia Watching Julie amp; Julia (Columbia Pictures) I could hear in my mind the faint buzz of what the movies detractors would probably say. Theres not nearly enough conflict in this upbeat story of two happily married women overcoming minor obstacles to find themselves as cooks and writers. The screenplay is meandering lacking in dramatic structure. The modern-day scenes in which Amy Adams plays the Queens-based food blogger Julie Powell lack the zing of the wonderful period segments with Meryl Streep as Julia Child in mid-20th-century Paris. The score by Alexandre Desplat can get overly expressive earnestly underlining the pathos or humor of moments that were doing just fine on their own. But I didnt let this imaginary nitpicking interfere with my pleasure. When you sit down to a meal do you want it to be filled with ""conflict"" and ""structure""? Do you whine if the witty little amuse-bouche (Adams) doesnt quite match the piece de resistance (Streep) in complexity and richness? In short do you complain that your dinner was too delicious? If so its not hard to locate a McDonalds and a theater showing G.I. Joe. But if you dont mind the occasional dip in a bain-marie of pure joy give yourself over to Julie amp; Julia. The opening titles announce that the movie will be based on two true stories Childs years in Paris with her diplomat husband Paul (Stanley Tucci) as chronicled in her autobiography My Life in France and Powells (Amy Adams) memoir of her year spent cooking and blogging her way through Childs seminal cookbook Mastering the Art of French Cooking with the support of her own well-fed but sexually starved spouse Eric (Chris Messina). Nora Ephron who wrote and directed the movie loves this kind of parallel cross-cutting structure; the leads in Sleepless in Seattle never met until the last scene and Julies and Julias lives overlap even less. Julie works at a phone bank at the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation overlooking the 9/11 ruins as she dispenses useless advice to frustrated survivors. (""Do you have any power?"" barks one caller. ""I want to speak to someone with power."") Julie a would-be writer with an unfinished novel is bored and depressed until Eric suggests she turn her passion for food into an online writing project. In the year that follows Julie looks deep within herself--a little too deep for Eric who starts to resent her all-consuming obsession with poulet roti a la Normande raspberry Bavarian cream and her blogs steadily growing yet mysteriously unquantifiable readership. (I know its supposed to be 2002 but havent these people ever heard of hit counters?) Advertisement Its when Ephron cuts to Paris that the poulet roti hits the fan. Streeps incarnation of Julia Child towers literally and figuratively over the movie. She plays the beefy 6-foot-2-inch Child with lusty comic verve yet her performance isnt broad in the least. Every word that emerges in that familiar octave-swooping voice is both hilariously funny and deeply felt. From the movies first scene in which Streep and Tucci wordlessly bond over the deliciousness of a sole meuniere we understand this woman completely Shes a sensualist and an adventurer deeply in love with her husband and far too ambitious to settle for the life of a diplomats wife. Tuccis understated performance as the wryly bemused partner of this human tornado is a treasure too. In two brief scenes its suggested that Julia and Paul now in middle age have missed out on their chance to conceive a child. When Julia learns that her sister (a sidesplittingly funny Jane Lynch) is pregnant Streep makes all Julias reactions--resentment joy grief resignation--visible in quick succession. Because the movie turns on plot points no bigger than ""Will my book be published?"" and ""Is the boeuf bourguignon overdone?"" Julie amp; Julia may be dismissed as insubstantial fluff a ditzy ""womens picture."" And its true that Nora Ephron doesnt rank among our nations deepest thinkers though she shows a surer directorial hand here than she has before. Still the relationship at the heart of this movie--between a female mentor and pupil who never meet but who share a common passion and a drive to reinvent themselves--is one you dont often see depicted in the movies. Julie amp; Julia makes deboning a duck a feminist act and cooking a great meal a creative triumph. The stakes may not be as high as the kill-or-be-killed suspense of a summer action movie but the sauces are way tastier. Slate V The Many Voices of Meryl Streep Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic.

Standing in the kitchen of her PBS series The French Chef which debuted in 1963 she was scarily tall (62""). Leaning down she would press those linebacker shoulders into the chicken she was butter-massaging describing the process in that famously exacting high-pitched warble --? a singsong quaver with a squawk of hysteria running through it. In Julie amp; Julia Nora Ephrons vivaciously wry and affectionate dramatization of how Julia Child became...Julia Child the woman who taught America to cook Meryl Streep plays Julia as a very grand figure of fun. Streep has made herself over so that she looks as tall and gawky as Big Bird (shes also just as disarmingly cheery) and she exquisitely mimics that voice -- the sound of a tipsy Victorian headmistress who has lost control of her flock. Julie amp; Julia is structured as a two-part culinary adventure The movie cuts back and forth between the true-life stories of two quirkily ambitious self-invented strivers from vastly different eras. (Its based on both of the womens memoirs.) Theres Julia who devotes herself right up to the early 60s to co-writing and finding a publisher for Mastering the Art of French Cooking which will be the very first French cookbook ever written in English. And theres Julie Powell (Amy Adams) a post-9/11 cubicle worker with the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation who in 2002 decides to save herself and her husband (Chris Messina) from the doldrums by retreating after work to their cramped kitchen in Queens and cooking every recipe in that book -- all 524 of them -- in one year while writing a blog diary about the experience. You could say that Julie amp; Julia is the first Nora Ephron movie that isnt a romantic comedy. Only that wouldnt be quite right. Not only is the film tartly witty its about a very deep love affair the one between Julia Child and the endless dinner party she thinks life can be a party Julie extends with ardent and neurotic intensity into the present day. Julia arrives in Paris where her husband Paul (Stanley Tucci) has been stationed by the OSS (the year is 1949) and when she sits down to her first Continental meal -- its a savory sole meuniere -- she cant believe how tangy-good it is. Streep makes Julias coos of pleasure as delighted as a babys gurgle. Were invited to coo and laugh along with her as the camera ogles the food -- which it will continue to do with taste-bud-teasing bliss throughout the movie. Julia a former clerk at the OSS herself (she mockingly hints that shes been a spy) is casting about for something to do so she talks her way into the Cordon Bleu cooking school where shes like Lucille Ball in basic training. Walking into the classroom which is full of male (and only male) chefs she tries with abandon to slice a pile of onions and then perfects the skill at home by dicing a mountain of them. It doesnt take long to get used to the funny goose-honk perfection of Streeps impersonation. Only then in fact do we really start to connect to the serious life-loving performance behind it. Julias gangly eagerness conceals a will of iron as well as a generosity of spirit thats too passionate to be merely funny. Shes a woman who wants to feed everyone gloriously -- herself and her husband her friends and the world. The Julia half of Julie amp; Julia is irresistible the Julie half less so. Not that it doesnt work exactly. Amy Adams nails the obsessiveness of Julies devotion to her muse Julia. She also captures the tactile pleasures and challenges of cooking (how in Gods name does one bone a duck?). And Ephron gives us nothing less than the first full-scale Hollywood portrait of the life of a blogger in all its creative fire and solitary caffeinated how many comments did I get? midnight narcissism. Yet the movie wants to make Julie an edgy ""bitch"" and soften her at the same time which doesnt exactly jell.

"movie review julie amp; julia julie amp; julia movie review julia child meryl streep julie powell amy adams - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Entertainment Entertainment Movie review Julie amp; Julia -- 4 out of 5 stars Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Julie amp; Julia is a gloriously frothy confection a late summer delight built on Meryl Streeps hilarious impersonation of The French Chef Julia Child.The comedy about a would-be writers attempt to cook her way through Childs culture-changing cookbook sees Nora Ephron return to her Sleepless in Seattle form. She combined Julie Powells book on her quest to ""be like Julia"" and Childs own memoir of her years in France to create a movie that engages every time it focuses on Julie (Amy Adams sweet as ever) in her Queens N.Y. kitchen and tickles every moment it flashes back to Julias struggles to learn French learn French cuisine and write the cookbook that taught America ""Bon appetit"" Julie was living in quiet desperation with a thankless job dealing with irate grieving New Yorkers over plans to replace The World Trade Center. But she liked to cook. Her husband (Chris Messina solid support) suggests a blog. And Julie comes up with a task the chance ""to finally finish something"" in her life. She will follow the 524 recipes in Childs Mastering the Art of French Cooking cook them all within a year and blog about it.As Julie goes through this culinary metamorphosis we skip back to the late 1940s when newlywed Julia Child (Stanley Tucci is spot-on perfect as her droll husband Paul) moved to Paris and found her lifes calling. The tall loud woman with the silly fluty voice boundless enthusiasm and adorably self-deprecating wit comes back to life in Streeps hands. Virtually every time she opens her mouth as ""Joooooolia"" she lands a laugh. Streep even plays ""tall"" a neat trick. Through her performance we realize as Julie did the truth in her husbands dont-be-intimidated-by-the-great-cook pep talk.""Julia Child wasnt always Julia Child.""Another coup -- landing the towering comedienne Jane Lynch (Role Models) as Julias sister. She holds her own with Streep and then some. Every bit of casting works so well that even slower moments sing.Julie amp; Julia does tend to bog down in the last act and using the entire riotous Dan Aykroyd ""Save the liver"" Saturday Night Live sketch is a cheat. But as Child put it whenever a souffle fell or crepe didnt flip ""Never apologize""Julie amp; Julia Four of five starsCast Meryl Streep Amy Adams Stanley Tucci Chris Messina Jane Lynch Director Nora EphronRunning time 2 hoursIndustry rating PG-13 for brief strong language and some sensuality.

Julie amp; Julia Good Director Nora Ephron. Cast Meryl Streep Amy Adams Stanley Tucci. Rating PG-13 for brief strong language and some sensuality. Related Julia Child bigger than life - and big screen Sweet Child o mine Meryl Streep is the Julia of Julie amp; Julia Spotlight Meryl Streep Spotlight Amy Adams Food in the movies Sorry. Well try to keep the cooking references to a minimum. But the fast-food analogy holds because although the calories ultimately are empty they sure are enjoyable. Bored with her menial job aspiring writer Julie Powell decided to cook all 524 recipes in Julia Childs ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" - in one year. Her husband Eric suggested she blog about it; she did and quickly became popular online and elsewhere. It was a daunting task. To sustain herself during times of trial and sensing some parallels Powell imagined the life of a bored Child living with her husband in Paris who for lack of anything better to do started taking cooking classes. Fortuitous decision it turned out like Picasso picking up a paintbrush. Writer and director Nora Ephron has taken her film from two books Childs ""My Life in France"" and the book Powell wrote about her project ""Julie amp; Julia My Year of Cooking Dangerously."" More important Ephron got Amy Adams to play Powell and Meryl Streep to play Child. Adams has in some ways the easier job. Powell while somewhat well-known in food (and blogging) circles isnt a household name. Child however is a legend her idiosyncratic television presence familiar to many and so different from anything audiences were used to that it would be easy to allow a portrayal of her to slip into parody. (In fact for those old enough to remember them Dan Aykroyds brilliant skits on ""Saturday Night Live"" as Child slicing her thumb stands as a well-loved gently mocking tribute so much so that some might worry theyll see bits of it in Streeps performance. Evidently aware of this Ephron tackles the problem head-on in a clever way.) Streep is tremendous a phrase thats probably stored in the cut-and-paste file of movie critics everywhere. She never devolves into parody; instead she infuses the character with a must-forge-ahead attitude that makes her both entertaining - dont try to tell her she cant chop onions - and relatable. She was just a woman looking for a hobby after all and after trying hatmaking and bridge stumbled onto something she was really good at. Cant we all picture doing something like that? Powell could. Adams plays her with the customary amount of pluck weve come to expect - the woman cant help but be adorable. Which is OK; shes not playing a serial killer. Its just not as well-rounded a performance nor as well-rounded a character as Streeps. The food of course looks awe-inspiring; youll walk away hungry. Ephron works hard to get the details right. She does the same with blogging capturing the unique thrill of when Powell goes from sending her writing into the ether to actually finding an audience. Ephron manages not to let telling parallel stories feel too forced at least until the last few scenes. But theres only a finite amount of time to tell those stories so when the frustration Powell and her husband (Chris Messina) feel comes to a head its startling. Where did that come from? Childs relationship with her husband Paul (a constantly bemused ever patient Stanley Tucci) feels more lived in perhaps because it was. But Ephron also glosses over details. How did Powell and her husband for instance pay for such an expensive project and the equipment and ingredients it required? Theres a reference to putting a PayPal button on her blog but surely that didnt foot the bills. Those are minor quibbles though like reading the nutritional information on a chocolate-chip cookie-dough Blizzard. Its best to think of ""Julie amp; Julia"" as dessert not a main course and to devour it accordingly. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

Nothing fancy like pheasant stuffed with pate and truffles in Champagne brandy but you can order her meat loaf at the Monkey Bar. She also loves movies and makes so many good ones that with a surfeit of junk polluting marquees everywhere shes become something of a treasure. In the kitchen or in the movies shes had her misses. At the stove I imagine shes no stranger to a fallen souffle or an over-salted stew and on the screen it takes work to forgive a pair of catastrophes like Michael and Mixed Nuts (even she couldnt make Adam Sandler funny). But when shes on her game she is perfect. Just to prove it I suggest--nay insist--you drop everything and race to see Julie amp; Julia as fast as your feet pedals wheels and walkers can carry you. This movie is an emerald of enchantment in the current sewer of cinematic trap rock. Julie amp; Julia is a journey into the heart of transcendental gastronomy based on a pair of books by two women who never met but who both found their identities and unlocked their souls through the joy of cooking. In 1949 Julia Child a bovine 6-foot-2 oddball from Pasadena Calif. shaped like a side of mutton with a voice that sounded like her tongue had been trussed with cotton twine for tying pork roasts moved to Paris with her husband Paul a diplomat in the American Embassy. Bored and looking for something creative to do during her husbands assignment she tried bridge and hat-designing before she signed up as the only woman in a class at the Cordon Bleu school. When she enrolled she didnt know how to fry an egg or say ""bonjour"" but in the decade that followed she devoted her life to every culinary detail of French cuisine and in 1961 with co-authors Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholle she published the first of two volumes of Mastering the Art of French Cooking a revolutionary kitchen Bible that taught American housewives to sharpen their knives and tackle beef bourguignon like it was no more daunting than a tuna casserole. Beyond teaching and publishing she became the first celebrity chef on television (even though she was the butt of many stand-up comic lampoons for sounding too much like a drag queen) famous for dropping food on the floor scooping it up again and plopping it back into the bouillabaisse. In 2006 her memoir My Life in France was published; its been reissued and repackaged for Nora Ephrons movie. Though 8 feet shorter than her subject and hardly built like linebacker for the Green Bay Packers Meryl Streep channels Julia Child so magnificently that mere descriptions are rendered impossible. Cut to 2002 when a mid-level cubicle worker named Julie Powell (played with delicate undeterred passion by Amy Adams) moves into a cramped little flat above a pizza parlor in Queens and like her mentor escapes reality (a stressful job as an administrative assistant listening to the telephone calls of woeful victims of 9/11) in the kitchen. Her goal to cook her way through the first volume of Mastering the Art of French Cooking one recipe at a time and write a blog about it. Her deadline 524 recipes in 365 days perfecting everything from A (spics of cold quail) to Z (zucchini in Mornay sauce). The results were published as Julie amp; Julia 365 Days 524 Recipes 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen in 2005. The movie catalogs the frustrations and triumphs of both women and their long-suffering well-fed husbands (Stanley Tucci as Paul Child and Chris Messina as Eric Powell both splendid). The stories waffle back and forth 50 years apart complementing each other while requiring constant fashion shifts in the styles of shoes wigs and saucepans. (No Cuisinarts for the original Julia; her first assignment as a Cordon Bleu student reduces Ms. Streep to red-eyed weeping over a mountain of chopped onions. Hilarious) The imposing narrative trajectory of combining two separate memoirs makes it impossible for writer-director Ephron to avoid fragmentation but it couldnt matter less. I was hypnotized from start to finish. When Julia Child died in 2004 the two chefs had never met (informed of Julies project Julia was not only unimpressed but curtly refused to include her on the guest list for her 90th birthday party) but the impact left on the younger woman by her mentor has been profound. Its an awfully good story well researched beautifully photographed hugely entertaining and oh baby the food Every scene is enhanced by it and the people eating it. Chicken smothered in truffles and cream; gorgeous towering chocolate layer cakes with fudge frosting that never slides sideways; lobsters swimming in saffron-colored hollandaise--all photographed like Cezannes. Youre shown a raspberry Bavarian cream that looks like a brand-new Ralph Lauren designer paint. What youre not shown is how hard and time-consuming it is--or what a mess it makes. Ms. Powells aspic does slide down the drain and there are chicken livers all over the floor but nobody is ever seen doing the dishes or blasting burned caramel off a copper saucepan. Lets be honest. Despite the popularity of the Food Network and everybodys indispensable love affair with eating (to many with hearty appetites a greater priority than sex) nobody is enough of a purist to really cook like this at home anymore. I dont know anyone who poaches an egg by dropping it into a pan of boiling water. As Michael Pollan pointed out so eloquently (and verbosely) in last weeks New York Times Magazine everything has changed. Who has the time after eight hours at the office to come home and de-bone six ducks in a reduced orange-pomegranate glaze for dinner guests? Who has the space for Julias army of double boilers and earthenware crocks for rillettes of rabbit the correct cutlery for cutting artichokes on the bias scraping lemon zest filleting trout or making paper ring covers for a bourbon apricot savarin? Most regrettably who can boast the cholesterol levels to accommodate a pound of salted butter for every sauteed chicken liver? When was the last time you turned out flambeed apricot crepes with pear marmalade humming in Cointreau? If this describes you then Im coming for dinner. Never mind. You will have a fabulous time drooling. The cast is a revelation. As Julie and Julia Amy Adams and Meryl Streep last seen together as nuns in Doubt are perfect counterparts and sisters under the skin. They are as different as two women tending their stoves can be but you still learn a lot about their similarities Both worked in menial government jobs before they discovered the magic of a salad fork; both married wonderful supportive husbands; both were lost and found themselves saved by food. Julias eight years of globe-trotting while waiting for her masterpiece to be published and Julies kitchen heroics in Queens are skillfully intercut. Myriad cooks substituted in the kitchen before each take and the budget for every dish exceeded the entire cost of Who is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe? and Tom Jones combined. Still its worth the acid reflux. Julie and Julia is the best food flick since Babettes Feast. Meryl Streep is so versatile that nothing she does surprises me but one is not exactly prepared to see her hand surgically attached to a wire whisk dripping with beaten egg whites. Diligent observant and fastidious she is amazing in the ways she channels Julia Childs big bones impossible 60s hair bulldog jaw and Cambridge lockjaw voice. I loved them both but nobody ever tells you what they did with the leftovers.

It was the worst of movies. Which is to say Theres half of a great movie in Julie amp; Julia--but since Meryl Streep has already starred in one titled Julia (Fred Zinnemanns penultimate feature in 1977) perhaps it was merely necessary to tack on the ""Julie"" half to distinguish Nora Ephrons butter-basted effort from its Lillian Hellmans mayonnaise-covered predecessor. (Sorry. So sorry.) If nothing else that tortured introduction reveals which half is the great half--the one featuring Streep as Julia Child but of course and not the Smithsonian-enshrined encased-in-amber forever-in-reruns Julia Child either but the toweringly lean and tremendously lustful Julia Child new to France in the late 1940s and ready to devour everything in sight even her husband Paul (Stanley Tucci).But back to them in a moment--best to skim the film off the film first in this case the half of Julie amp; Julia adapted from Julie Powells blog-turned-memoir from which the movie takes its name. The tome is an absolutely delightful read in which Powell uses Child and in particular Childs 1961 cookbook Mastering the Art of French Cooking to discover ""what it takes to find your way in the world"" as she wrote. Yet all Ephron saw in that tale was just another dreary romantic comedy about a woman played by a slow-simmering Amy Adams who hates her job (tending to the families of people killed in the World Trade Center attacks--Powells office was perched over the gaping wound) hates her friends (climbers as self-obsessed as she) hates her apartment (in Queens over a pizzeria) and escapes into cooking and writing about cooking till she leaves behind her supportive husband Eric played by Chris Messina but only briefly whew. The book originally shopped as a stand-alone project could have made for a scrappy scrumptious indie--all the outer-borough funk and main-course ""fucks"" of the book left intact Bridget Jones doused in Bearnaise sauce and vodka gimlets. But Ephron has excised the heart (and gizzard and liver and so on) from Powells tale. How could the writer-director not see that she had rigged this patently unfair game of Compare and Contrast?Still if Ephron is to be criticized for treating Powell like a soggy sitcom creation she (along with Streep) should be celebrated for rendering Child flesh and blood--all passion and pleasure even during moments of self-doubt. Not in forever has a movie character been this joyful this playful this much fun to be around. Her delight is infectious from the first moment we see her ogling the sights and sounds of Paris upon her and Pauls arrival there in 1948; the first time we actually meet her Julia is mmmmmm-ing over the sight and smells and first bite of fish melting in butter. Ephron captures the earthy delights and everyday thrills found both in Childs cookbook and 2006 autobiography My Life in France; the filmmaker gets us to positively revel in everything Julia from the perfect slicing of an onion to the publication of a cookbook a decade in the making to the afternoon ""naps"" she and Paul would enjoy between feasts. Yes indeed Julia Child as sex objectStreep and Tucci are a joy to be around--such pragmatic romantics. Paired again after The Devil Wears Prada in which Tucci played whipping boy to Streeps ice queen they have the rapport of bygone on-screen couples--William Powell and Myrna Loy maybe partners in crime. Every slight glance feels absolutely natural; every kiss deeply felt. Perhaps someone will do for Julie amp; Julia what one enterprising Star Wars fan did for Episode I The Phantom Menace when he released a bootleg shorn of that annoyance named Jar-Jar Binks and titled it The Phantom Edit. Surely theres room enough in this world for two Meryl Streep movies named Julia.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Half-Baked At least the Julia Child portions of Julie amp; Julia are scrumptious. Plus Miyazakis poetic Ponyo. _ By David Edelstein Published Aug 3 2009 ShareThis (Photo Jonathan Wenk/Courtesy of Sony Pictures Entertainment) For teachers of the method shaping a character begins with psychological self-plumbing but some actors find that by getting the externals right (cadence physical mannerisms wardrobe) they can cut a direct path to the soul. Thats the case with Meryl Streep as the middle-aged Julia Child in the comedy Julie amp; Julia What begins as a great impersonation becomes a marvel of sympathetic imagination. The performance is transcendental. Streeps voice is deeply musical starting in the chest and erupting into that burbling falsetto with its trills and diphthongs. The voice is Streeps way into Childs pleasure centers and the bodystiff-shouldered sloshing around like an ocean linerfollows along in a kind of daffy interpretive dance. Streep isnt tall but shes photographed carefully and projects height; she understands that the six-foot-two Child learned not to be ashamed of her size but to go with it. Her Julia is a force. At one point she falls into bed with her husband Paul (Stanley Tucci) and ones instinctive responseJulia Child having sex Ewww gives way to Julia Child having sex Awesome Anything to hear that voice in full happy throttle This is a Nora Ephron movie which means cartoonish extroverts pulling faces. But Streep kicks it up about a million notches and Ephron is an enthusiastic cook so the film has some foodie texture. Its a shame the protagonist isnt Julia but Julie Julie Powell (Amy Adams) who in real life distracted herself from a messy existence with a blog that chronicled her effort to cook all 524 dishes in Child and Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholles Mastering the Art of French Cooking. Powells book about that yearlong homage/ordeal is fast and fun and the recipes are so out-of-fashion (aspic) its like a voyage back in time. But when Ephron cuts between Paris in the fifties and Queens in 2002 to show Julia and Julie as they both achieve autonomy through cooking The Godfather Part II this aintthe connection is strained. (The Child material is based on her memoir My Life in France written with her nephew Alex PrudHomme.) Julies character doesnt even track. Shes referred to as a bitch but all weve seen is the patented Ephron adorable klutz. (Adams is too good to waste on Meg Ryan parts.) Ephron should make a film about the person she herself is (smart acid) instead of the cutie-pixie of her dumb fantasies. Julie amp; Julia is full of holes but you dont even care when Streep is onscreen. In one scene Julia greets her sister at a train station and the marvelous Jane Lynch makes a whooping entrance a giantess even more ebulliently uncoordinated than her sister. Tuccis Paul gazes on them like a man in clover. Tucci has a wonderful easy presence here My guess is his bedazzlement with Streep merged with Pauls bedazzlement with Julia and the whole is even greater than the sum of its parts. When actors like these are cooking its better than haute cuisine. Hayao Miyazakis latest animated film a very loose adaptation of The Little Mermaid called Ponyo is more straightforward and kiddie-friendly than such multilayered masterpieces as Spirited Away but in some ways its simplicity lets you see the directors greatness more clearly. The title character a fish who turns into a little girl to be with a boy named Sosuke runs on top of the turbulent waves during a fierce typhoon and those waves are suddenly huge dark fish that dissolve back into waves and then again into fish and again into waves as the girl is carried forward. I could invoke the Buddha or fix Miyazakis ethos with a neat label like pantheismbut his universe is too unpredictable too fluid too protean. Nothing in Miyazakis universe ever stops transforming There are spirits tucked away ready to turn what you think you seethe visible worldinto something else. Miyazaki proves why two-dimensional hand-drawn animation will always be more thrilling than 3-D It doesnt need to pretend to be bound by the laws of physics. The borders between flesh and spirit are infinitely porous. Before I get too high-flown let me say that Ponyo is unsullied by Disneys English-language casting of Miley Cyruss little sister as Ponyo and a Jonas brother as Sosukealthough Noah Lindsey Cyrus is a tad shrill. But Liam Neeson has gravely splendid pipes as Ponyos father a once-human wizard who lives underwater and despises humankind for polluting the planet. The early scenes recall Peter Maxs Yellow Submarine with the father in a blue candy-striped jacket and flowing hair a kind of undersea ringmaster. The father keeps his precious daughter in a bubble afraid shell be carried to the surfacewhich she is anyway on a jellyfishand before he can rescue her the wee fish begins her evolution. The natural world goes into an uproar as the moon descends and waters rise and it falls to young Sosuke to prove his love for Ponyo is true. 1 2 Next Share this story...

It should come as no surprise that Meryl Streeps delightfully daffy turn as Julia Child the woman who demystified French cuisine for American households is the freshest ingredient in ""Julie amp; Julia."" Otherwise this middling melange of Child biopic and contempo dramedy feels overstuffed and predigested as it depicts two ladies who found fame and fulfillment in their respective eras by cooking and writing about it. Despite the lack of shared screen time the reteaming of ""Doubt"" duo Streep and Amy Adams under the femme-friendly imprimatur of writer-director Nora Ephron should yield tasty returns for this self-satisfied foodie fairy tale. ""Julie amp; Julia"" shares its title with Julie Powells barbed-and-bubbly 2005 book about her plan to chop stir bake and whip her way through Childs seminal 1961 cookbook ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking."" Powells blog devoted to her crazy yearlong experiment dubbed ""The Julie/Julia Project"" developed enough of a following to earn her a book deal and as the end titles note with characteristic cuteness inspire this movie. Probably aware that Powells story alone wouldnt sustain an entire feature Ephron opted to divide the films 122-minute running time between Julie and Julia also drawing material from the latters posthumously completed 2006 memoir ""My Life in France."" Upon arriving in Paris in 1948 with her husband Paul (Stanley Tucci) who has taken a job at the American embassy Julia (Streep) a self-described ""36-year-old rather loud and unserious Californian"" is enraptured by French culture in general and French cuisine in particular. The pic efficiently traces Julias determined rise from impassioned gourmand to master cook from her education alongside unfriendly male competition at the Cordon Bleu school to her friendship with fellow epicureans Simone Beck (Linda Emond) and Louisette Bertholle (Helen Carey) -- her eventual collaborators on the 524-recipe cookbook that no publisher would initially accept. Meanwhile in a rickety Gotham apartment circa 2002 Julie (a redheaded Adams) alarmed at the prospect of turning 30 and having little to show for it embarks on her insane assignment -- working as a government secretary by day cooking and blogging by night. Fortunately Julies husband Eric (Chris Messina) loves her enough to put up with her exaggerated mood swings whenever a dish goes awry though his patience and sensitivity wear thin as the project drags on. And so the film implies a kinship between two women who never meet united across time and space by their love of butter their doting husbands their search for meaning through pleasure and their struggles to see their work in print. (Call it ""Publisher-less in Paris."") The crucial difference one Ephron doesnt seem to grasp is that while Julie courts the fickle attentions of the blogosphere and the media Julia yearns to create something of lasting value a work with genuine potential to enrich peoples lives. Ironically the pics decision to foreground Julias life only ends up trivializing it; by conflating the characters so neatly ""Julie amp; Julia"" becomes the slick presumptuous vanity project that Powells book was not. Doing her formidable best to counteract these drawbacks is Streep whose 5-foot-6 frame makes her an imperfect physical match for the 6-foot-2 Julia but who proves more than up to the challenge of tackling this beloved celebritys equally outsized personality. Delivering an elegant approximation of the womans distinctly flutelike vocal pitch and endearing mannerisms Streep abundantly conveys the warmth rich humor and joie de vivre so evident in Julias TV appearances and her writing. She and Tucci (as fine a foil here as he was in ""The Devil Wears Prada"") etch moving portraits of two people who can scarcely conceal their delight at being married to each other. As a more prosaic and bickersome modern couple Adams and Messina acquit themselves well enough; Adams rather miraculously manages not to sink under the weight of her characters cloying perkiness and weepy hysterics. The overall tone of the present-day material strikes familiar unsubtle romantic-comedy beats with a few catty dashes of ""Sex and the City"" and ""Bridget Joness Diary"" thrown in to taste. While Ann Roths costumes and Mark Rickers production design nail the dual milieus with impressive versatility the Paris scenes feel slightly gauche and unconvincing; commercial considerations likely account for the near-total absence of French dialogue. Most disappointingly aside from the occasional glimpse of boeuf bourguignon the film misses a clear opportunity to offer glorious culinary eye candy on the level of ""Babettes Feast"" or ""Eat Drink Man Woman."" Whatever auds make of ""Julie amp; Julia"" its hard to imagine that Julia Child herself an unapologetic Francophile with one hell of an appetite would have been much of a fan.
