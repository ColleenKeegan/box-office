Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Family audiences have turned this sequel to 2010s surprise animated hit into a certified smash. Im not surprised. Three years have turned Despicable Me into a DVD babysitter with kids enjoying multiple viewings of the villainous huncbacked inventor Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) and his Minions yellow munchkins born for mischief. So what if the followup comes up short in originality and surprise. Its still a first-class charm assault. Carell growls gleefully as he distracts his three adopted daughters with inventions so cool that we forget (almost) that hes grown a squishy heart. Gru even gets a love interest in secret agent Lucy Wilde voiced by Kristen Wiig with enough scene-stealing comic verve to make the Minions jealous. The plot cooked up by Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio involves a secret serum and is spindly enough to rival Grus legs. But co-directors Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin who do Minion voices expertly never let up on the laughs. A fart joke in 3-D may not be three times as wacky but the high spirits of Despicable Me 2 are irresistible fun.

Nope (B) Can you have too many minion moments in Despicable Me 2? Nope (B) By NANCY CHURNIN nchurnindallasnews.com Staff Writer Published 03 July 2013 0237 PM Updated 03 July 2013 0337 PM Related Reel Genius Kids will think Despicable Me 2 is the best thing theyve ever seen The appeal of the minions our ""Despicable"" Id If only you could buy a reduced ticket for just the first hour of The Lone Ranger (C-) Reel Genius White House Down basically Die Hard in D.C. Villainy Romance Minions And lets say it again minionsYes the Despicable gang is back for Despicable Me 2 and it looks as if this could follow Monsters University as the second animated franchise to hit it big this season.What made the 2010 movie irresistible was telling the story from the point of view of the hulking villainous Gru (Steve Carell) and seeing how the love of three little orphans originally intended as pawns in one of his dastardly schemes ultimately changes him into a good dad and a good person.But how do you tell a story about a bad guy who is no longer a bad guy? Despicable Me 2 embraces the dilemma and adds new ones.Gruesome Gru still lives in the one dark and mysterious house on an otherwise sunny street but now on his front yard theres a princess birthday party with a crisis.When the performer he hires as a fairy princess cancels Gru dons a frilly tutu in a scene reminiscent of Steve Martin dressing up as the cowboy who failed to show at his kids birthday party in Parenthood. (The joke will no doubt seem fresh for Despicable fans born long after the 1989 film.)Grus minions are now playing with the girls and making foul-tasting jams under the direction of former evil-weapons creator Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand). Meanwhile the girls want a mom and Gru hates to date. Then Lucy (Kristen Wiig who was in the last movie as nasty Miss Hattie) kidnaps and brings him to a mysterious Anti-Villain League where hes asked to use his know-how to find and stop a new mastermind.The cool twist is that the villains scheme involves the minions. And in case you were wondering if it is possible to have too many minion moments it turns out no.Much fun has been made at the expense of Al Pacino who dropped out as the villain due to what he called an offensive characterization (the part is now voiced by Benjamin Bratt). For the record I agree with Pacino.Apart from this misstep the tone by returning directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud and writers Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul is spot on the 3-D animation is glorious and the voice work particularly by Wiig and Carell is funny affecting and endearing.It turns out that this is just the tip of the Wiig-and-Carell iceberg this year. The pair team up for Anchorman The Legend Continues plus Wiig stars in The Secret Life of Walter Mitty both due out in December and Carell who starred in The Incredible Burt Wonderstone in March opens in The Way Way Back in theaters Friday.As with the minions they keep making us eager for more.Despicable Me 2(B) Directed by Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud.

Technically thats true but this pleasing sequel is actually a classic marriage plot. Having acquired those three cute daughters (Edith Margo and Agnes) and reformed his supervillain ways (hes attempting to make jams and jellies in his basement laboratory) the domesticated Gru (Steve Carell) is now after a lifetime of avoiding the opposite sex for fear of rejection shoved into the dating market. We first catch glimpse of him at Agnes birthday party where the besotted new dad is forced into donning a frilly dress that would do Little Bo Peep proud (the rented fairy princess failed to show). He hasnt lost his edge entirely though. ""How come youre so fat?"" one of the little party guests asks accusingly. ""Because my house is made of candy"" Gru tells her. ""And sometimes I eat instead of facing my problems."" While the Minions provide most of the obvious laughs -- the flatulence humor is plentiful -- returning screenwriters Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul slip in choice lines like this for the parents in the audience. (MORE Richard Corliss on the First Despicable Me) Gru remains top-heavy bald and possessed of a nose as sharp as scythe but the local moms arent about to let an eligible man go unmatched. A simpering blonde neighbor Jillian (Nasim Pedrad) sends him out on a date with one of her desperate housewife friends. (This overexercised puffy-lipped creature is voiced by the great Kristen Schaal which made me hope for a second date despite how badly the first one goes.) His adopted daughters even join in the dating game creating an online dating profile for him. But ultimately Grus love interest is Lucy (Kristen Wiig) an aggressive agent with the Anti-Villain League who bests him with her lipstick taser on the first encounter -- this sequence involving Lucy piloting a car that turns into a boat and then back into a car again is one of the more artful pieces of animation in a nifty-looking movie. (MORE The Lone Ranger Lost in a Western Myth) Gru is recruited for a mission involving teaming up with Lucy for undercover work at a local mall where a supervillain is supposedly hiding in plain sight preparing some nefarious plot involving a toxic serum that turns even the sweetest puppy into a killing machine. In a nod perhaps to Wiigs Bridesmaids baking-obsessed character their false front is a cupcake shop although no one spends much time in the bakery. Gru is most suspicious of the proprietor of a Mexican restaurant El Macho (Benjamin Bratt) who bears a strong resemblance to an allegedly dead former colleague of his but much of his animosity could stem from the fact that El Machos young hipster son (Moises Arias) catches the eye of Edith now at the age of texting. (MORE White House Down D.C. Meets Die Hard) The character of Lucy is beautifully drawn a sharp slender 1960s-style silhouette but Wiigs voice work is curiously flat. Much of her dialogue is almost without affect and you can picture the actress behind the character at that point mumbling those droll little asides on Saturday Night Live. Much as a break from the customary shrill voices of animated family movies is appreciated Lucys shrinking-violet voice sometimes seems ill matched to a character so fiercely committed to her bold crime-fighting career. But thats a quibble; Despicable Me 2 is far more entertaining than the disappointingly bland Monsters University and as a sequel stands level with the first film (also directed by Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud) and may have the edge on it. I saw the movie in 3-D which generally speaking I can take or leave but prefer to leave given the extra expense. But Despicable Me 2 makes expert use of it; stay for the end credits which are fabulous and give rise to the hope that the upcoming 2014 release Minions may be a worthy spin-off. I was very resistant to the Minions the first time around but have grown quite fond of Grus squishy yellow helpmates whose versatility extends from vacuuming to doing a fine rendition of the Village Peoples ""YMCA."" As the song goes there is no need to feel down. Not when the Minions are around.

Slideshow Despicable Me 2 still delivers Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about Despicable Me 2 >> Happily one sequel doesnt take itself too seriously the animated supervillain family pic Despicable Me 2 featuring the inimitable Steve Carell as the voice of that nefarious and most gruesome of all baddies Gru. Sure it visits the same ground as the 2010 monster hit which to date has earned more than half a billion dollars worldwide. And yeah the jokes digital-effects wizardry and visual gags will be familiar to fans of the first. But Despicable Me 2 still manages to deliver more fun per pound than the bloated Man of Steel director Zach Snyders attempt to  re-re-re-resurrect the Superman franchise. When we last saw Gru he had given up villainy - of either the super or minor kind - to take care of his three adopted daughters Margo Edith and Agnes. We learn that Gru and his best friend the ancient and remarkably decrepit Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) have embarked on a new career path making jellies and jams. As the film opens Gru and his lovable Minions are hosting a lavish fairground-style birthday party for Agnes on the front lawn of their Gothic Dr. Frankensteinian house in the suburbs. But fate has plans for Gru and hes pulled back into the supervillain business when comely Anti-Villain League superagent Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig) recruits him to fight the forces of evil and save the world. Seems a mega-bad-guy who runs a store at the nearby mall has stolen a secret serum that can turn anyone it touches into an invincible homicidal - and very purple - monster. Madcap adventures and derring-do follow including car chases rocket rides fistfights and even a cockfight. Theres romance Gru nearly has a breakdown when his eldest girl Margo falls for a smooth-talking black-leather-jacket-clad operator named Antonio Perez (Moises Arias). For his part Gru goes all goo-goo for Lucy. A happy ending is had by all. If youre looking for quality prepackaged predigested Hollywood family fun this summer you could do a lot worse than Despicable Me 2.

"Review Despicable Me 2 takes refreshing risk with grown-up themes - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Despicable Me 2 takes refreshing risk with grown-up themes Despicable Me 2 Movie review by Betsy Sharkey Betsy Sharkey reviews Despicable Me 2 starring Steve Carell Steve Coogan Kristen Wiig and Benjamin Bratt. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Betsy Sharkey reviews Despicable Me 2 starring Steve Carell Steve Coogan Kristen Wiig and Benjamin Bratt. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Betsy Sharkey Film Critic The pressures of being a single father. The realization that despite everything your kids still long for a mom. The difficulties of getting a teenage daughters attention between texting and a boy. The boy. The treacherous emotional terrain of middle-age dating. The challenges of staying relevant in the workplace.This is ""Despicable Me 2""? It is. The softhearted villain Gru so disarmingly voiced by Steve Carell has gotten a lot more than he bargained for after 2010s ""Despicable Me."" Adopting three adorable orphans brought a slew of issues into his life and those modern problems frame the sequel.PHOTOS Despicable Me 2 premiere What a refreshing twist. Also a risk -- fans of big hits have expectations. But I think the filmmakers were smart to try turning the animated kid-flick formula on its head and go for the adults as much as the kids.Tiny top-knotted Agnes (Elsie Kate Fisher) pink punker Edith (Dana Gaier) and teenage Margo (Miranda Cosgrove) who first wrapped the worlds No. 1 bad guy around their sticky little fingers in 2010s ""Despicable Me"" have taken over Grus life.The daddy gig barely leaves time for villainy. A birthday party for Agnes which gives the 3-D animated film its first big visual pop makes clear just how good Grus gone.All the sweetness has Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) plotting new ways to draw Gru back into more cynical schemes. Its hard not to side with Nefario at least a bit on this one. But co-directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud and screenwriters Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul -- the creative team behind the first -- are intent on testing new waters. Sometimes choppy ones that occasionally get the better of them.For the small set the filmmakers have thrown in some kid crises that touch on blended families and growing up. But mostly they rely on Minion mayhem and a few other tricks to keep the squirm factor in check. The toothy little yellow optimists forever at Grus beck and call are about to be compromised in ways that will rock his world. And probably launch a new toy line.PHOTOS Hollywood backlot momentsVillainy just not Grus still lurks around every corner and its set once again to the hypnotically dark beat of hip-hop maestro Pharrell Williams.We get a hint of the bad in the opening sequence. A super-secret research lab is lifted right off the polar ice cap where it was hiding. In the wrong hands the stuff being tested there could do terrible things. So of course it is now in the wrong hands -- but whose?Answering that question is why the Anti-Villain League headed by Silas Ramsbottom (Steve Coogan) -- whose name sends the Minions into laughing fits that rival the effect of the first films Fart Ray Gun -- has summoned Gru. Well technically hes had agent Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig) kidnap him. Turning Lucy and Gru into an undercover team sets up the films major conflicts.Their on-the-case one-upmanship is electrifying -- or at least Lucys lipstick Taser is -- and their chemistry is slightly terrifying. All the cool gadgets guns and cars that go along with the job allow the animators to go off the rails with them.The super-secret stuff is really just the tease. What makes for such fun is its gross transformative powers. Traces have been found in Paradise Mall where Eduardo Perez (Benjamin Bratt) operates a Mexican restaurant. Eduardo reminds Gru of an old nemesis and Margo is smitten with Eduardos teenage son. Its a coin toss which is more nerve-wracking.Even with slightly heavier issues like its predecessor ""Despicable Me 2"" is light on its feet visually inventive and very fast with the repartee. It requires actors who can pull off the many peppery lines at warp speed and in that the film is lucky with its voice cast.Carell is impossible not to like with his Transylvania accent shifting between bravado and acquiescence. It fits the films clean yet slightly sinister animated look epitomized by Grus bald head prominent eyebrows long pointed nose and that irrepressible grin. Wiig is a good opposite number for Carell assertive without becoming a caricature of extremes which is an easy trap when voicing a cartoon.With little girls in the house I guess it was only a matter of time until the idea of finding a girlfriend for dad would arise. As amusing as it is to watch them work on a dating profile for Gru the story gets too squishy when it goes too mushy. The movie is on far more solid ground when the goop is unleashed. For a while the entire despicable world goes completely crazy and the animation matches the insanity marvelously.As delightfully different as all the relevancy is ""Despicable Me 2"" suffers slightly from not being as despicable as it could -- or probably should -- be. Perhaps just another blast or two from the Fart Ray Gun would have been all the despicable wed have needed.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com----------------------------------Despicable Me 2MPAA rating PG for rude humor and mild actionRunning time 1 hour 38 minutesPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Animation (Movie Genre) Entertainment Movies Despicable Me 2 Steve Carell Kristen Wiig Russell Brand With Despicable Me 2 fans again go bananas over Grus minions Despicable Me 2 to beat Lone Ranger at Fourth of July box office Despicable Me 2 premiere celebrates the return of the minions Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad76deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-despicable-me-2-20130703,0,7121425.story",200,despicableme28,despicableme2,latimes

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Gru gets back to work with his lovable Minions in ""Despicable Me 2."" (Universal Pictures) By Stephanie Merry July 2 2013 Follow stephmerry The minions are back. The little yellow torpedoes warmed hearts when they shuffled into 2010s animated hit ""Despicable Me"" with the bounciness of a beach ball the elasticity of a rubber band and a vernacular composed mostly of giggles. Once again they manage to tickle moviegoers big and small in the way only cat videos usually do and they very nearly run off with the sequel ""Despicable Me 2."" But the sweet story holds its own. The Russian-accented Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) is a very different villain than when we last saw him. He has traded in a life of crime including moon thievery and other high jinks for a more sedate occupation. Gru his accomplice Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) and the minions now spend their days making jam and Gru passes his evenings taking care of his adopted trio of daughters Margo Edith and Agnes. His biggest stressors are planning Agness birthday party and coming to grips with Margos interest in boys. But this homey existence is shaken when agent Lucy (Kristen Wiig) of the Anti-Villain League drops in with a lipstick taser and a plan to recruit the reformed bad guy. It seems that an under-the-radar supervillain has used a giant magnet to make off with an entire laboratory that housed a gooey substance capable of transforming people animals and minions into purple snaggletoothed monsters that eat everything in sight. The league has tracked the supervillain to a mall and they need Gru to embed himself deep within the concrete jungle to discern which of the store owners is responsible. Gru agrees to take on the gig although hes hardly thrilled to be joined by Lucy as his new partner. The identity of the villain isnt much of a mystery -- there are only two real possibilities a wig shop owner and the proprietor of a Tex-Mex restaurant -- but other story lines round out the narrative including Grus romantic interest in Lucy Margos crush on a possible supervillains son and a minion-napper who is making off with Grus worker bees at an alarming rate. ""Despicable Me 2"" is a tamer movie than its predecessor which may irk some of that movies fans. A better title might be ""Delightful Me"" given that Gru is entirely devoted to his kids and seems disinclined to revisit his former profession. People change. Expecting Gru to be the same abominable shadow-dweller is like assuming close friends will still want to go out every night once theyve gotten married and moved to the suburbs. Then again Gru doesnt shed all of his former tendencies. Hes still an unassuming action hero with impressive moves for a man built like a barrel balancing atop chopsticks. He just tends to laugh less maniacally between action sequences. Some of those lively operations should provide a bit of nail-biting especially for little ones. But theres plenty of fun music to buoy the mood thanks to original tunes from Pharrell Williams. And the animation is beguiling particularly when Lucy drives her car into the ocean transforming it into a submarine that scoots around sharks and fish. Theres no need however to spend extra cash on the 3-D version. The glasses dont add much allure with one exception During the final credits as in the original film the minions try to reach out from the screen as far as they can. That was the first time the technology elicited ""ooohs"" from the audience. The thought of being so close to those adorable wee beings was too much to silently bear. Luckily theres more where that came from. A ""Despicable Me"" spinoff ""Minions"" is set for a 2014 release. Despicable Me 2  (98 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for rude humor and mild action. lifestyle style true Please provide a valid email address.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Tuesday Jul. 02 2013 1201AM EDT Last updated Tuesday Jul. 02 2013 1201AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud Written by Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul Starring Featuring the voices of Steve Carell Kristen Wiig and Benjamin Bratt Classification PG Genre animation Country USA Language English The Hollywood official motto to any kind of success should be ""You can say that again."" In 2010 when the first Despicable Me was released Variety predicted that box-office prospects for the retro tale of a Bond-style aspiring super-villain and three little girls he adopts looked ""solid but hardly stellar."" Yet Despicable Me went on to earn more than half a billion at the box office giving Universal a cartoon franchise to compete with Pixar (Toy Story) DreamWorks (Shrek) and 20th Century Fox (Ice Age). Once again the super-villain Gru and his chattering robot ""minions"" are back in Despicable Me 2 an animated sequel that despite not achieving the inspired lunacy of the first movie where Gru literally steals the moon is smartly calculated to deliver squeals to kids and amusement to accompanying adults.Though created with computer-generated imagery Despicable Me had a zany alternative sensibility with spiky-looking characters and jokes to match that evoked the art of Edward Gorey the mischief of Jay Wards The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show and the irreverence of Looney Tunes cartoons. In other words it replicates the brash sensibility of the cartoons parents grew up on.Early scenes catch us up with Grus life. The now-retired super-villain (voiced in a Bela Lugosi accent by Steve Carell) is a hulking misanthropic foreigner who lives in the only Gothic home on a street lined with cookie-cutter suburban houses full of friendly bland Americans. Physically Gru resembles an anthropomorphized beetle (or perhaps Vladimir Nabokovs description of Humbert Humbert in Lolita as ""husky big boned wooly chested"" with ""thick black eyebrows"" and ""a face that might twitch with neuralgia."") Like any former self-respecting world-class villain he has an underground lab overseen by a toothy English scientist (voiced by Russell Brand) and manned by his legion of gibbering ""minions"" - tiny yellow creatures dressed in blue overalls and goggles which resemble a warehouse filled with barbiturate capsules.As the new movie begins Gru who having adopted three little girls Margo (Miranda Cosgrove) Edith (Dana Gaier) and Agnes (Elsie Fisher) in the first movie is struggling to adjust to domestic life. He has converted his lab into a factory for artisanal jam and jellies while he resists pressure to date more.Hes recruited by a gangly Olive Oyl-like agent from the Anti-Villain league named Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig in her jumpy oversharing mode) who wants Gru to infiltrate the local shopping mall to learn the identity of a super-villain who is in possession of a ""transmutation"" serum that can turn ordinary creatures into monsters.Gru is immediately suspicious of the gregarious walrus-shaped owner of a Mexican theme restaurant (Benjamin Bratt) who has an unmistakable resemblance to a former super-villain El Macho who dressed like a masked lucha libra wrestler and who almost certainly died years earlier riding a rocket tied to a shark tied to 250 pounds of TNT into a live volcano. At the same time Gru has an entirely personal reason to want to bring the restaurant owner down The mans mallrat son a pint-sized Latin lover seems to have won the heart of Margot the eldest of Grus adopted daughters.While one part of Despicable Me 2 focuses on Grus parental and romantic dilemmas his minions are involved in their subplot in which they are subjected to mass kidnapping and transmutational experiments. The minions serve as a kind of chorus of silent-movie comedians and their childish antics make them the obvious kid pleasers here though for adults in the audience their incomprehensible jabbering may become grating. The minions will get their own movie in 2014 which judging by the final minutes of Despicable Me 2 will be lively ingratiating and a lot less despicably clever than its predecessors.

Comments click to enlarge Despicable Me 2 Video Rated PG  98 minutes  2013 The family animation Despicable Me (2010) proved superior to its ilk thanks to some vivid action sequences and a screenplay that combined actual emotion with surprisingly smart comedy (the occasional fart joke notwithstanding). In this disposable sequel the original movies supervillain-turned-family-man (given voice by Steve Carrell) tries to track down a mysterious criminal; directors Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin deserve credit for not rehashing the basic ideas of their first effort but they never really expand upon its unique universe either. The only characters developed here are the cyclopean yellow monsters known as the Minions whose irreverent tirades recall the anarchic slapstick of Chico Marx and early Looney Tunes.

We think we want characters to ""grow"" and ""change"" but really its the people around us in real life--people who say loudly pick their teeth in restaurants or walk too slowly in public thoroughfares--who need revamping. (We ourselves of course need no improvement.) Theres a liberating joy in watching fictional characters be as bad as they want to be which was one of the open secrets powering Pierre Coffin and Chris Renauds jubilant indecorous 2010 animated feature Despicable Me in which a potbellied misanthrope named Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) procured a shrink ray as part of his evil plan to steal the moon.Gru also ended up adopting a trio of cute orphans which is pretty much the beginning of the end for any world-class villain. Despicable Me released by Universal was close to perfect especially compared with the alleged masterpieces of the almighty Pixar For years that studio coasted on its reputation for putting out costly elaborate constructions like Up and WALL-E that tugged at audiences hearts shamelessly but stealthily. And while Pixar has made a few terrific pictures--namely the Brad Bird-directed Ratatouille and The Incredibles--Despicable Me was so unrepentant in its lack of moral virtue and so much fun that it seemed to have opened up a new world. It was so good in fact that making a sequel sounded like a terrible idea Now that Gru is a dad does he have to be a nice guy? The sort whod never steal let alone shrink the moon? Wheres the fun in that?But Despicable Me 2 remains resolutely unshrunk. Its breezy and affable without ever going completely soft. That becomes clear early on when Gru after staging a backyard birthday party for the youngest of his three little ""gorltz"" blasts an annoying neighbor with a garden hose. In his unidentifiable accent--half borscht half Borscht Belt--he offers the ultimate unapologetic apology ""Im so sorry I did not see you there.""Film Details Despicable Me 2 RatingPG GenreAnimation Running Time98 min. More Info Trailer The kids have made Gru kinder in some ways but also less willing to put up with BS--its all well and good to wax poetic about how raising children makes you a better person but Despicable Me 2 reminds us that parenthood isnt for sissies. And Gru is most definitely not a sissy. This time around hes tough enough to don a fairy costume so as not to disappoint the birthday girl; he joins an outfit called the Anti-Villain League which roots out bad guys at (where else?) the local mall; and he even meets his match in the form of a willowy redheaded AVL colleague known as Lucy (Kristen Wiig). Villainy it seems is much easier than navigating the shoals of love.There are so many ways Despicable Me 2 could have gone wrong and so many things it does right. Working from a script by Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul (who also wrote the first film) directors Coffin and Renaud take great care with the pacing. The opening in which an Arctic Circle research facility is whisked off into the sky is extravagant in a James Bond way. And the finale is suitably action-packed though nervous parents can rest assured that the weapons used here squirt nothing but jelly. (That doesnt stop Gru from pulling off a John Woo-style double-jelly-gun maneuver.)In between Coffin and Renaud keep everything blessedly low-key proving that you dont need an antic plot when your characters are well drawn to begin with. Lucy the love interest is the best kind of animated screwball heroine With her rubbery limbs she has an ostrich ballerinas grace but she can look after herself too--she comes armed with a lipstick Taser and doesnt think twice about using it. And Gru wearing his usual uniform of black drainpipe trousers Beatle boots and Euro-groovy zip-up jacket--hes shaped like a hipster Monsieur Hulot--reaches new heights of grousing and English-mangling some of them marvelously lowbrow. He cant resist a jab or two at the expense of Silas Ramsbottom an uptight English AVL bigwig (voiced by Steve Coogan). And come on--you wouldnt be able to either.Best of all Despicable Me 2 devises an expanded role for the Minions those capsule-shaped overall-wearing underlings--many graced with two googly eyes some making do with only one--who happily do Grus bidding. In Despicable Me 2 the Minions as part of a dastardly plot are kidnapped and brought to a tropical resort where they slurp cocktails wear headdresses made of fruit and hula to Mungo Jerry tunes all day. This vision is exhilarating nutty and not for the over-caffeinated. In fact the dangerous influence of Despicable Me 2 became apparent at the screening I attended populated largely by kids. As the lights came up bunches of them were still whooping it up jiggling their way toward the exits in a kind of mindless Brownian movement chattering at one another in mock Minion-ese. Despicable Me 2 sets a very bad example for otherwise perfectly well-behaved children. Thats just one more reason to love it.Follow VoiceFilmClub Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Stephanie Zacharek Follow szacharek Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 6 p.m. EDT July 2 2013The sequel isnt nearly as imaginative or delightful as the original.Formerly villainous mastermind Gru (Steve Carell) and his loyal but bungling minions return in Despicable Me 2.(Photo Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review   out of fourVoices Steve Carell Kristen Wiig Benjamin Bratt Russell Brand Steve Coogan Miranda CosgroveRated PG; runtime 1 hour 38 minutes; opens Wednesday nationwideThere isnt much to warm up to in Despicable Me 2 (  out of four; rated PG; opening Wednesday nationwide).This shallow sequel to 2010s much cleverer Despicable Me -- the 10th-biggest animated movie in U.S. history -- seems to be merely going through the motions.The endearing (and still barely intelligible) yellow minions are back as is the formerly evil Gru (Steve Carell) who is now a loving dad. In the first movie he was plotting to steal the moon. But his three adopted daughters made him want to be a better man. A reformed bad guy hes also a little bit boring. Hes still cranky however when it comes to dating. (In a flashback we get a vague idea why.) His girls long for a mother and encourage him to try online romance. Havent we seen enough dating disaster montages in movies to last a lifetime?STORY Minions evil plot Steal the show in Despicable Me 2REVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersGUIDE USA TODAYs summer movie calendarGru is contacted by the Anti-Villain League (AVL) which is headed by Silas Ramsbottom (Steve Coogan) to track down a mysterious baddie who has stolen a top-secret lab and its monster-fashioning serum. A colleague in the form of ultra-enthusiastic AVL agent Lucy (Kristen Wiig) is called in to assist Gru. Its not hard to deduce that a romance will ensue. Wiigs talent for offbeat characters seems wasted here in a conventional role that just calls for peppy eagerness. Slapstick high jinks are plentiful though never particularly funny.Having given up a life of evildoing Gru is busy overseeing a jam-making business with his chattery minions as assembly workers and Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) as the scientist concocting flavors. But the final project is foul-tasting. So when Gru is offered the undercover assignment hes hardly keen to preserve his jam production. Of course it helps that he just might save the world in the process.As part of his cover he opens a cupcake shop in a mall. Soon he nurses suspicions about Eduardo (Benjamin Bratt) the friendly owner of a Mexican restaurant nearby. Gru is certain that the gregarious restaurateur is actually the malevolent El Macho who allegedly died while riding a shark into the mouth of a volcano. Bratt is the only new character who seems to be giving his part his vocal all.Grus girls are appealing characters while the minions are clearly the ones that have the greatest appeal for those under 10. Youngest daughter Agnes (Elsie Kate Fisher) is particularly adorable. Theres a short-lived romance between Grus oldest daughter Margo (Miranda Cosgrove) and Antonio (Moises Arias) Eduardos son. Gru takes an immediate dislike to Antonio. Because the screenwriters dont bother to develop the characters of either father or son Grus reactions seem borderline racist.With its predecessor having made a whopping 540 million globally its no wonder that Universal saw fit to order a sequel. But its not enough just to trot out legions of minions and cobble together a plot. Audiences deserve more imagination and inventiveness than this wan recycling. 225 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDIN 55 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/160M3lmSummer Movies Calendar JulyTake a look at the films heading to the box office this July complete with trailers reviews clips related stories and more.

Sorry Pixar. This summer the bad guys are winning. Former bad guys that is. In ""Despicable Me 2"" the chrome-domed Gru (Steve Carell) who used to traffic in supervillainy is now embracing his role as dad to three orphaned girls (""gar-urls"" filtered through his delightfully hammy Russian accent) far more complex than anything his arch-nemeses could have dreamed up. We open on a birthday party for the littlest Agnes (Elsie Kate Fisher) huge-eyed lover of everything pink and fluffy -- so naturally Gru must stuff his potato-on-toothpicks body into a fairy princess costume to make her face light up. As in the original ""Despicable"" masterful physical comedy is what raises this animated pic so far above most of its competitors. Sure its not as novel as the first time we were here but directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud stay true to the clever slapstick vibe. Grus three daughters Margo (from left) Agnes and Edith return in this spot-on sequel. The minions naturally are a large part of the magic. Little yellow and pill-shaped Grus babbling helpers look like escapees from a pharmaceutical commercial -- and their antics are scientifically engineered for maximum kid hilarity (two words fart gun). Of course just when Gru thinks hes out hes pulled back in this time by the ""Anti-Villain League"" and an overenthusiastic junior agent Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig). Wiigs great at voicing animation; her verbal tics and modulations work perfectly for this gawky thrill-chasing character. The initial sequence in which she chases Gru down with the help of ""lipstick taser"" and car-turned-submarine is one of the films best. RELATED WHATS NEW IN THIS SEASONS ANIMATED MOVIES? After she drags an unwitting Gru to the AVLs undersea lair Steve Coogans stern agency head explains theres a new crime boss in town with a dastardly master plan. The reformed Gru can help the good guys by exploiting his bad guy know-how. He and the comely Agent Wilde case a local shopping mall in search of the new villain where candidates include Ken Jeongs wig purveyor and Benjamin Bratts Mexican restaurant owner whos a ringer for a long-missing baddie named El Macho. (Never has 3-D animation been so questionably used as to detail this characters vast expanse of chest hair.) Hes also got a bad-boy son the same age as Grus eledest Margo (Miranda Cosgrove) giving rise to the delicious scenario of a former supervillain reacting to his little girls first boyfriend. The film makes well-timed callbacks to some of the funniest gags in the first one like wizened Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) and his molasses-slow scooter ""getaway"" and Agnes attachment to her ""so fluffy"" stuffed unicorn. Her glass-shattering shriek when an interloper attempts to take it from her is the most potent weapon of all. There are new characters to love like a vicious watch-chicken who guards the Mexican joint (and knows his way around a detonator) and a demented purple version of the minions that harkens back to The Muppets Animal. Like all really quality kid entertainment its full of shout-outs to grown-up stuff as in the Indiana Jones-reminiscent walk Gru must take through a booby-trapped corridor to get to a treasure -- only this hero must correctly dance out the tune to ""La Cucaracha"" on the tiles. And Nasim Pedrad of ""SNL"" makes an appearance as Grus meddling neighbor insistent on setting him up with her irritating friends; his flat ""Oh I did not see you standing there"" after blasting her full in the face with a garden hose will be especially enjoyable for anyone whos been similarly needled. But it really all does come back to the minions who raise the hilarity quotient every time theyre on-screen. Just when you think the directors are going to overdo it with these yellow weirdos they dont -- but the end credits do feature scenes from ""Minion Movie Auditions."" A spinoff is apparently set for 2014 and Im betting where this is where the series loses its edge. Perhaps not though. So far the directors have demonstrated an admirable resistance to cutesiness. Two words fart gun.

Despicable Minions steal Despicable Me 2 By Joe Williams joewilliamspost-dispatch.com 314-340-8344 Joe Williams Jul 2 2013 (...) Jody Mitori Gru Dr. Nefario and a crowd of minions in ""Despicable Me 2."" Hollywood has invented a term for a certain type of movie toyetic which means conducive to spin-off merchandising.Pixar productions such as ""Cars"" and the three ""Toy Story"" films embodied this lucrative principal but ""Despicable Me 2"" is toyetic to infinity and beyond.Whereas the first installment wooed parents with a story about a super villain who adopts three orphans this animated sequel speaks to a younger audience in a language called Minion. Grus peanut-shaped banana-colored sidekicks are so nutty and sweet that kids will want to collect em all. Meanwhile moms and dads can savor the eye candy. This loony toon is dizzy with wonderments especially in 3-D. The spindly-limbed character design owes more to Charles Addams family than to Walt Disneys kingdom while the story and settings evoke James Bond on laughing gas.When a serum to turn the world evil is lifted from a lab in the South Pole adoptive dad Gru (voice of Steve Carell by way of Boris Badenov) is lured out of retirement to help the Anti Villain League investigate. The agency pairs him with a perky junior crime-fighter named Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig). Their mission to infiltrate the domed shopping mall where traces of the serum have been detected.That entails opening a cupcake shop to spy on the other store owners. One of them is Mexican restaurateur Eduardo (Benjamin Bratt) who bears a suspicious resemblance to the villain El Macho from Grus bad old days. As Gru and Lucy snoop around Eduardos kitchen they experience queasy feelings that might be amor and adorable little Agnes (Elsie Fisher) fantasizes about having a mom. Meanwhile Grus eldest daughter Margo (Miranda Cosgrove) develops a nervous itch around Eduardos caliente son Antonio (Moises Arias).Given the gooey message of the first film this sequel has surprisingly little to say about love and family and often what it does say is unintelligible. Thats because the scene-stealing minions talk -- and sing -- in gibberish (mostly voiced by co-directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud). ""Despicable Me 2"" is trying to tickle not teach. In a marketplace full of toxic messages thats not such a bad thing.What ""Despicable Me 2""  Two and a half stars out of four  Rating PG  Run time 138  Content Rude humor and mild language Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

Photo Credit Universal Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Former supervillain Gru now a suburban dad is pulled back into the game of good vs. evil. Rated PG BOTTOM LINE Better or at least sweeter than the first with Wiig adding some much-needed romantic charm to the toddler-level humor. CAST Voices of Steve Carell Kristen Wiig Benjamin Bratt LENGTH 129 Back in 2010 Universal Pictures animated film ""Despicable Me"" seemed like a series of calculated decisions without much heart. A lovable supervillain named Gru (the voice of Steve Carell) provided the high-concept premise while the cutesy factor came from the three little girls he reluctantly took in. Grus banana-hued minions provided the toddler-level slapstick while chattering in an alien language that surely made international dubbing easier. The film became a 543 million worldwide hit. The sequel ""Despicable Me 2"" has a lot more heart or maybe the filmmakers have just gotten smarter. Either way its an improvement largely thanks to Kristen Wiig (""Bridesmaids"") the voice of a superspy named Lucy Wilde. A loopy gangly carrot-top with friendly green eyes she gives this movie a spark of romance and a screwball charm that the original lacked. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? But wait -- another kids movie with a spy theme? That tactic sank ""Cars 2"" (though I liked it) and made a mess of ""Madagascar 3 Europes Most Wanted"" (though everyone else liked it) but it works just fine here. Gru is living comfortably as a single suburban dad to tweenage Margo (Miranda Cosgrove) middle child Edith (Dana Gaier) and wittle Agnes (Elsie Fisher) when hes kidnapped by Lucy an overambitious karate-chopping field agent from the Anti-Villain League. (Shes a cartoon cousin to Sandra Bullock in ""The Heat."") Turns out the AVL needs help capturing an unidentified baddie. What follows is something between Disneys ""The Parent Trap"" and the Jackie Chan romp ""The Spy Next Door."" Gru and Lucy scour a local mall for signs of evil -- hmmm could that Mexican restaurant owner (Benjamin Bratt) be our suspect? -- while the girls try to turn Lucy into Mommy. Its formulaic and the plot threadbare but the blush of romance somehow brings out the best in everyone here. Gru becomes more appealing the girls less cloying and even the minions seem newly inspired.

"Despicable Me 2 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; despicable-me-2 ) Despicable Me 2 (United States 2013) July 02 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Despicable Me 2 feels like a opportunity to get together with some old friends hang out and discover what theyve been up to. The movie lacks the high voltage wit of its predecessor but the breezy charm is still in place and especially for kids its a chance to reconnect with characters who made an unexpectedly enduring impact during their introduction. As a nod to the popularity of the robotic Minions their roles have been upped for this installment. Despicable Me 2 follows the formula for animated success to a ""T."" Theres just enough ""smart"" material to retain the interest of adults sufficient slapstick and colorful ""action"" to keep kids involved and 3-D to ensure that the box office gross gets a nice bump from the surcharge. Note about the 3-D it is used mainly to throw things at the audience a tactic that is employed primarily (and to greatest effect) during the end credits. The movie starts out an unspecified time following the conclusion of Despicable Me. Former supervillain Gru (voice of Steve Carell) is living a life of domestic simplicity with his three adopted daughters Margo (Miranda Cosgrove) Agnes (Elsie Fisher) and Edith (Dana Gaier). Instead of ray guns and diabolical schemes his day-to-day routine now consists of running a legitimate business (making jelly) and planning Agnes birthday party. Along comes Secret Agent Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig) of the Anti-Villain League to recruit Gru for a special assignment. An unknown person has stolen a shipment of a super-secret toxic substance that threatens the worlds safety. If injected it can turn the most passive creature into something that looks like a blue version of the Muppet ""Animal"" and acts like the Tasmanian Devil (Warner Brothers version). The pompous head of the AVL big jowled Silas Ramsbottom (Steve Coogan) wants Gru to go undercover with Lucy at a mall and unmask the nefarious miscreant behind the plot. Theres not a lot to Despicable Me 2. The central plot is thin and the storyline frequently veers off on tangents related to Grus struggle to be a good parent (hes terrified by the thought that his girls especially Margo might be discovering boys) and his attempt to kindle a romantic relationship with Lucy. We even get some Gru-as-a-kid flashbacks. Theres never much mystery about who the megalomaniac bad guy is nor is the climactic battle filled with more than a thimbleful of suspense. Still taking everything together the experience works as light undemanding entertainment. Its not quite as rich a meal as Monsters University but its close. The satirical element that played such a big part of Despicable Me has been toned down considerably here. There are aspects of it but they remain primarily in the background. Now that Gru has crossed over to join the good guys theres little room for the frequent send-ups of traditional over-the-top villainous tactics and methods. With some of the freshness dissipated (as often happens with sequels) the screenplay for Despicable Me 2 loses some of the cleverness that colored Despicable Me. However the writers Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul and directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud have returned and their familiarity with the characters and their situations ensures that the same tone is maintained. The look of the film is similar to that of its predecessor with cartoonishly exaggerated characters influenced by Boris amp; Natasha and their ilk. These arent meant to be photo-realistic. And could the red-haired Lucy be at least in part inspired by Lucille Ball? Despicable Me 2 takes place in an animated world and is proud of the fact. Theres nothing surprising when a car turns into a submarine or when people fall a long distance then get up and dust themselves off. The colors are bright and thankfully the 3-D doesnt ruin that. This is the best use of 3-D in an animated film this year. Despicable Me 2 is probably the 2013 summers most hotly anticipated family film (even more so than Monsters University) and the only ones likely to be disappointed are those expecting something bigger and better than Grus origin story. Like most un-preplanned sequels this one doesnt veer far from the well-trodden path but thats not always a negative especially for a family film. Despicable Me 2 provides a good bonding opportunity for parents and children with enough palatable elements to please members of both generations.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The most successful animated movie of the last decade that wasnt made by Pixar and didnt star a grumpy green ogre Despicable Me strikes a delicate balance between adorable (those parentless tykes) and deplorable (the delightfully black-hearted dastard who took them in). A sequel was a foregone conclusion but how did those responsible lose sight of what made the original special? In the most basic sense Despicable Me 2 reproduces its predecessors winning formula. Here again is Steve Carell adopting an exaggerated Eastern European accent to voice Gru a Dr. Evil-ish arch-scoundrel. Also back are his moppet wards--a trio of orphan girls including the little one with the yen for unicorns--and his absent-minded tech support (Russell Brand a scientist less mad than loopy). And naturally the new film is filthy with minions those nattering subhuman sidekicks taking a break from selling auto insurance and pancakes. Whats missing--and this was the crucial component of part one--is a little sour to undercut the sweet. Like its protagonist a bad guy gone boringly good Despicable Me 2 has no edge. Its fatally nice and insufficiently naughty. Having given up a life of grand larceny to focus on fatherhood stay-at-home supervillain Carell dotes on his daughters and dodges the affections of the local soccer moms. His heart ballooned three sizes since the events of the first film just isnt in the crime game anymore. But when a new megalomaniac starts plucking up research facilities with a giant magnet Carell comes out of retirement to track him down. This requires relocating to a suburban shopping mall--an appropriate central setting for such a domesticated sequel--where he goes undercover to catch the incognito baddie. Half-assing its whodunit conceit the film produces only two suspects. Thats because its main focus isnt mystery but romance Carell gradually swoons for his klutzy do-gooder partner (Kristen Wiig) a rookie agent of the Anti-Villain League. Meanwhile his oldest daughter (Miranda Cosgrove) makes eyes with a preteen Latin lothario (Moises Arias). Love is in the air poisoning the atmosphere of this once-irreverent franchise like a toxic emission from one of Brands patented fart guns. With Carell busy falling head over heels slapstick duties land squarely on the diminutive shoulders of the minions whose giddy gibberish and Three Stooges antics are still pitched at toddlers of all ages. The movies one inspired idea lifted from Gremlins is to transform these glorified plush dolls into slobbering maniacal monsters--a development that lends Despicable Me 2 a brief breadth of anarchy. Alas even this twist feels sanitized as the mutated mascots are unleashed on a deserted island not in a place where they could get into any real mischief. (Perhaps the creators are saving the best pratfalls for next years cash-grab spinoff Minions.) Should this series plod on heres hoping it goes back to the laboratory for a retool. Even if Gru cant revert to his old Lex Luthorian habits theres got to be a way to slow his descent into sitcom cuddliness. He shouldnt be despicable in the way According To Jim is.

That would be 2- to 6-year-olds and parents who enjoy seeing their kids curled into balls of uncontrollable laughter. You need to have seen the original 2010 comedy to get the most out of this sequel. Luckily a lot of people have. ""Despicable Me"" Universal Studios first venture into computer animated cartooning was a smash. It offered a nifty novelty with a would-be supervillain as the central character. Gru (Steve Carell with a larynx-twisting Hungarian accent) was a perversely winning mash-up of Dr. Seuss Grinch and Charles Addams Uncle Fester. The film had a dark and whimsical sense of humor that was occasionally downright grisly. Gru adopted three sugar-sweet orphan girls who could help him infiltrate his archenemys compound. He put the girls to sleep in hollowed-out bombs. When one appeared to be skewered inside an iron maiden he kept in the kitchen he shrugged ""Plan can work with two."" Margo Enid and Agnes are back and more prominent in this tale. No longer a misanthrope Gru dotes on his daughters and spends much of his time fending off inappropriate dates foisted on him by his busybody neighbors. An odd-couple potential romance appears when he teams up with an agent of the Anti-Villain League (Kristin Wiig returning from the original but in a new role) to discover which shop owner at the local mall is a baddie in disguise. Is the new fiend on the block the oddly coiffed owner of the wig shop (Ken Jeong)? The proprietor of the Mexican restaurant (Benjamin Bratt) who serves his customers life-sized taco sombreros filled with guacamole? As before Grus assisted sort of by a zany band of yellow pill-shaped Minions who jabber a gibberish language and cook up all manner of clumsy monkeyshines. The roster of grown-up characters is smaller than in the first outing to make more room for the Minions accident-prone antics and gobbledygook versions of platinum-selling pop hits. Its all as bright and bouncy as a roller-coaster ride. Pretty much any gag that would go over the head of a 7-year-old has been removed. In fact the only grownup joke I noticed was that one missile in an array of doomsday rockets targeted Hoboken. But this is not a movie for jaded grownups. A squeal of excitement shivered through the preview audience when the Fart Gun reappeared from the first film. Same again for the comeback of Kyle Grus green fangy pet dog creature. And for Dr. Nefario Grus assistant and his very slow moped. Feed Loader ""Despicable Me 2"" For an adult the predictability could turn you blase. For kids revisiting these jokes is a howl. Pinkie promise.

Grade B+ Silas Ramsbottom (Steve Coogan) head of the Anti-Villain League tries to lure the reformed evildoer Gru (Steve Carell) out of his cozy single fathers life with the help of a star-struck AVL agent Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig) who thinks Grus villainy ""was kind of amazing."" Grus mission should he accept it is to locate the brilliant wretch who stole a ""transmutation serum"" that can change even innocent bunnies into hideous aggressive creatures. Gru eventually counts himself in -- and so should any fan of corkscrew-funny animation. ""Despicable Me 2"" uses the franchises wacky alternate universe and a wispy espionage plot to riff on everything from the runaway technology of spy films (Lucys Mini Flamethrower matches Grus freeze ray) to the cutesy excesses of shopping malls (she and Gru go undercover at a shop called ""Bake My Day""). Gru the arrested-adolescent genius who once deserved to get arrested goes through some credible growing pains. Hes a doting parent to his three adopted daughters (voiced with affecting emotion and flair by Miranda Cosgrove Elsie Fisher and Dana Gaier). Hes as moody and antsy as a shy teenage boy with grown-up females except for Lucy whos on his geeky wavelength. The adult voice actors match the daft animation; they include Russell Brand as Grus deceptively doddering techno-guru Dr. Nefario and Benjamin Bratt as the combustible macho Mexican-restaurant owner Eduardo. The story doesnt generate enough momentum but the images and characters are always breezy and bold. And whenever the movie flags Grus tiny Minions save the day. The directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud supply the Minions high-pitched gibberish. These caplet-shaped nonsense-spouting creatures have become masters of mugging. The Minions provide mega-doses of pure inspiration. Its impossible to analyze how the directors wring so much humor out of their bright eyes and big pupils the elastic skin around double or single eyes and even their pathetically scraggly hair. Visually these little guys are irresistible. Farcically theyre inexhaustible. Their toothy mouths reshape in an instant from wide-open ""uh-ohs"" to crumpled smiles. They turn juvenile ADHD into comic platinum. Theyre seductively funny not just because theyre easily distracted but also because they never pass up any chance to jump for joy.

On the other hand reports of the movies charm have been greatly exaggerated. Its a reasonably efficient baby sitter done up in 3-D computer-generated animation of no special distinction. But the first ones weird mixture of James Bond bombast and hyperactive pill-shaped Minions (the protagonist Grus goggle-clad helpers) had the element of surprise in its favor.This time Gru is placed in the takes-one-to-catch-one mold of Hannibal Lecter. An arctic research lab gets sucked up into space by a giant magnet in the prologue. The Anti-Villain League (Kristen Wiig voices Lucy the sweet tightly wound AVL agent) recruits Gru to track down the villain in question El Macho. Much of ""Despicable Me 2"" takes place in an antiseptic ""Logans Run""-styled mall where Gru and Lu work undercover and their fellow tenants include a hair-club toupee peddler (Ken Jeong voice) and a seductive Mexican restaurant owner (Benjamin Bratt taking over for the originally slated Al Pacino) whose dreamy teenage son (Moises Arias) catches the eye of Grus oldest (Miranda Cosgrove).To my taste as well as that of several nervous preteens in the preview audience the script by Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio (""The Lorax"" ""Horton Hears a Who"") goes in for an awful lot of cheap scares notably when the Minions are injected with a serum changing them into hairy menacing purple beasts. Would it kill a movie such as this to find another way to keep the target audience in its collective seat? The Minions are amusing but they remain largely undifferentiated creatures saved from pure generica only by their peppy gibberish-based language skills heavy on the flatulence sound effects.Steve Carells Slavic inflections as Gru do the trick as before. Wiigs clever hesitations and comic timing help save the day. The minute her characters pointy-ish nose appears on screen with the rest of her you know she and the extremely pointy-nosed Gru are going to be sweethearts. Next year the Minions star in their own movie titled ""Minions."" ""Despicable Me 2"" will do until that one comes along.mjphillipstribune.comMPAA rating PG (for rude humor and mild action)Running time 138Opens Wednesday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesFilm Review Despicable Me 2June 15 2013Grus band of Minions take spotlight in Despicable Me 2July 2 2013Despicable Me Cheesy 3-D meets mama issuesJuly 8 2010Illumination Chief Chris Meledandri Lines Up Originals for...July 17 2013Find More Stories AboutAl PacinoMinionsGruTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0701-despicable-me-2-20130703,0,5586450.column",200,despicableme223,despicableme2,chicagotribune

By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Jul 4 2013 1015 AM One of the more-dramatic moments in movies is when (sigh spoiler alert) Darth Vader reveals to Luke Skywalker that he is his father. Shocks and chills all around even now. Imagine a sequel in which Darth Vader didnt die but instead hosts birthday parties and play dates for his son and youll have an idea of where ""Despicable Me 2"" is headed. You miss that evil black heart. In the original film released in 2010 Gru (voice of Steve Carell) an evil mastermind (sort of) in the competitive world of being a bad guy plotted to steal the moon. This plan was complicated by his adoption of the adorable little girls Margo (Miranda Cosgrove) Edith (Dana Gaier) and Agnes (Elsie Fisher). By the end of the first film Gru was putting aside his evil ways to concentrate on being a dad. In the sequel the transformation is complete. He is indeed hosting birthday parties for his girls and has tasked the also formerly evil Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) with turning his warped mind to making a line of jams and jellies. However when a serum that turns mild-mannered bunnies into savage killers is stolen from the Arctic Circle (dont spend too much time on the details youll just get a headache) a top-secret outfit called the Anti-Villain League recruits Gru to find the culprit. Gru is reluctant but eventually agrees and is paired with a goofy green agent named Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig). Grus daughters see the possibility of romance. Gru for reasons explained in hilariously sad fashion (one of the few nods to dark humor remaining) does not. But come on. You know where thats headed. You know where its all headed really. Neither directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud nor screenwriters Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul try to hide much. Which isnt to say there arent some laughs. Carells Gru provides some as does Wiig though you cant shake the feeling that she ought to be you know funnier somehow. And if you are a fan of the Minions the cute little yellow creatures in the first film who assisted Gru in his schemes you are in luck. They often take over the film their hijinks stretching things out as the main plot is simple enough that it wouldnt take much time to resolve. If you dont like the Minions this is going to be a long slog. Benjamin Bratt is good as Eduardo the owner of a Mexican restaurant in a mall where the AVL thinks the serum may be hidden. Eduardos son Antonio (Moises Arias) is a little heartbreaker with eyes for Margo much to Grus chagrin. If it sounds like a lot of elements thrown together thats because it is. The meandering story wont bother small children probably but remember someone has to take them. But theres also this No matter what pressing world-threatening event requires his attention if one of his girls needs him Gru drops what hes doing and attends to it. Not always successfully (not even usually) but there is something endearing about his devotion to his family. In terms of creating a good-guy character this goes a long way. Which is ultimately the problem. A too-good Gru is a boring Gru. No matter how much you crank up the adorability factor or offer up the occasional laugh there is no getting around that.

The idea of a diabolical super-villain being turned into a kindly dad is a promising one but Carells Gru character seemed like such a softie to begin with (moon-stealing plans or no) that the shift never felt particularly outrageous or funny. And if you thought ""Despicable Me"" was tame wait until you see how much more neutered things get in ""Despicable Me 2"" which manages to strip nearly all of the characters of whatever sharp edges they once possessed. The minions are still wacky scene-stealers -- and once again we dont get nearly enough of them -- but Gru and his daughters have been blanded down to bad-sitcom level. This time around Gru is a single dad despite the best efforts of his pushy neighbor Jilliam (voiced by Nasim Pedrad) who is always trying to push him off on her single gal pals and his daughters Margo (Miranda Cosgrove) Edith (Dana Gaier) and Agnes (Elsie Fisher) who are setting up online dating profiles for the reformed bad guy. Gru gets recruited by the AVL (Anti-Villain League) to track down the person who has stolen an experimental serum that turns fluffy bunnies into giant purple pain merchants and the League pairs him with agent Lucy (Kristen Wiig). They have a meet-cute when she uses her lipstick-taser on him. The thief is one of several merchants at a nearby mall so Gru and Lucy are set up in a bakery to keep an eye out on their fellow vendors. Exceedingly tame wackiness ensues. Its one thing to turn Gru from an evil genius to a cuddly dad and boyfriend but Agnes isnt nearly as entertainingly hyper as before and even Margo has been rendered all swoony in her first crush on a boy -- Antonio (Moises Arias ""The Kings of Summer"") whose Mexican-restaurant-owning father Eduardo (Benjamin Bratt) may or may not be the guy Gru and Lucy are after the one whos been injecting the minions with the serum and turning them into frizzy-haired beasts. Little kids wont be too bored but adults who found themselves charmed by the first ""Despicable Me"" may or may not be along for the ride this time. Universal has already announced a third sequel ""Minions"" (which sadly isnt solely centered on those walking ids) and heres hoping Gru can be a little despicable-r next time.

The unpredictably hilarious Minions are back in ""Despicable Me 2"" summer 2013s much-anticipated follow-up to Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainments blockbuster comedy adventure ""Despicable Me"". Photo Universal Pictures Illumination Entertainment Despicable Me 2 has Minion-size plot 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Despicable Me 2 Comedy. Starring the voices of Steve Carell Kristen Wiig and Benjamin Bratt. Directed by Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud. (PG. 98 minutes.) Its a credit to ""Despicable Me 2"" that the writing can be so funny in the moment that it takes time to realize theres no cohesive story zero dramatic tension and nary a practical lesson for either the characters in the film or the people watching in the theater. This is the difference between eating a really good cheeseburger with an ocean view and eating the same cheeseburger at your desk at work. The second cheeseburger is still satisfying. But Jimmy Buffett will never write a song about the experience. Illumination Entertainments original ""Despicable Me"" in 2010 was more focused following clumsy James Bond villain caricature Gru as he meets and falls for three foster children. The ending feels complete but the movie made a lot of money and you can imagine the desperate pitch meeting for the sequel ""Lets give Gru a love interest"" ""Maybe do more stuff with those Minions."" ""Have him fight a villain whos a Mexican wrestler this time"" ""How about something with a shopping mall?"" ""Lets borrow from the second half of Gremlins "" They settled on ""all of the above"" pairing Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) with newcomer Lucy (Kristen Wiig) an agent who shares his combination of social awkwardness and capacity for mayhem. In a typically offbeat aside Grus super-villain lair is now being used to make a line of designer jams and jellies. Gru and Lucy must search a mall for a mystery villains serum which is capable of turning his cute yellow Minions into purple (but still cute) killing machines. Theres a lot to like or at least laugh at. Carell once again makes an effort voicing Gru with an emotional core at the center of that ridiculous accent. Writers Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul embrace the over-the-top tone finding offbeat fun in Grus tendency to announce the nature of his secret weapon before firing it. The animation isnt elite so the filmmakers go for broke with the 3-D presentation which harkens back to the comin-at-ya gimmickry of the 1950s and 1980s. (Once in a while its OK to use this medium to blow bubbles into the theater.) And finally working like cinematic spackle are the Minions who look like a combination of R2-D2 and that cute kid with glasses in ""Jerry Maguire."" These asides used as filler play like short films in the middle of the larger work. No surprise a Minion-focused ""Despicable Me"" spin-off is set for next year. It all moves along nicely until you realize the narrative isnt really moving at all. Boyfriend trouble and stalled class projects are all the girls have to do. With no real purpose Grus middle adopted child practically gets Jan Brady-ed out of the plot. If she was visible in flesh and blood instead of tiny pixels youd feel sorry for the actress. Im writing this paragraph less than 48 hours after seeing the film and the ending was so lackluster I dont remember the details. My notebook says ""Sort of rips off Friends. "" Was there a plane involved? A monkey? Did Gru go to Yemen? The makers of the sequel could have shuffled the storyboards like a deck of cards and the movie wouldnt have suffered much. The 8-year-olds next to you would still be laughing nonstop at the slapstick overkill. And the parents next to them would still be thankful that the theater has air conditioning. During a hot summer with limited choices that just might be worth the money. Peter Hartlaub is The San Francisco Chronicles pop culture critic.

On one hand you always want to see more of the characters youve grown to love from ""The Lord of the Rings"" to ""Iron Man"" to yes even good ol Bella Swan. The downside of this familiarity comes sadly with the temptation to merely do the same thing all over again. For if it worked once why not just run it back collect the check and go about your merry way? ""The Hangover Part II"" was the worst modern version of a sequel turning in a lazy effort though films such as ""The Hobbit"" and ""Taken 2"" arent exactly blameless either. Where does ""Despicable Me 2"" land in this equation? Somewhere in the middle never quite reaching the heights of ""Monsters University"" or most of the ""Harry Potter"" series though never fully falling flat on its face. Basically ""Despicable Me 2"" is more than content to glide along trading upon the goodwill generated by the originals charm. Precisely where does this become a bad thing? Well if you ascribe to the notion each story must stand on its own or perhaps if you believe in the idea of wanting each film you watch to bring a little something new to the table. ""Despicable Me 2"" doesnt check the box on either of those accolades. However if youre looking for the always popular ""good time"" ""Despicable Me 2"" certainly has that going for it. The film is lovable though in the same way an adorable puppy is even when careening into the refrigerator in pursuit of a tennis ball or stumbling over wobbly feet on the way to feeding time. This time around Gru (Steve Carell) has gone legit and his focus is the business of jams and jellies. Clearly thats delightful and his adorable trio of little ladies is back in full force too together forming an unstoppable bond of cuteness. Still none of this makes for a story arc and so Gru is enlisted into the Anti-Villian League brought into the fold to find an unknown baddie one intent on building a group of monsters with a stolen secret formula. Gru going good comes along with a partner from the AVL Lucy (Kristen Wiig) who naturally brings her own wonky charms to the story. The animated chemistry between Gru and Lucy is apparent and the temptation to focus more on this plot device must have been seriously tempting (more on that shortly). Unfortunately ""Despicable Me 2"" isnt really about chasing down an evil-doer. There are plenty of asides and these dalliances from the story sap some of the momentum from the piece. Many other themes are introduced in a relatively haphazard manner leaving ""Despicable Me 2"" balancing numerous storylines many of which have completely different tonal directions. Should Gru stay a bachelor? Do the girls need a mother figure? Once youve been evil can you make the transition to positive deeds? Finally how is Gru going to handle the oldest daughter Margo taking a shine to boys? As you can see alternating chase scenes with parental frowns toward dating is a bit like neutral dropping your engine and it leads to some clunkiness. That said ""Despicable Me 2"" is fun especially near the culmination. Structural issues aside its impossible not to like these characters all of them rendered with love always entertaining even when the story around them doesnt make much sense. The minions also routinely score on the comedy front though lets be clear they are basically glorified little yellow stooges. Their humor is completely based upon miscommunication and physical comedy. Again not a bad thing but a worry as the series goes forward because physical comedy tends to wear thin if continually repeated. The strongest elements of the film are the father-daughter relationships and in fact they may have been better off simply jettisoning the ""save the world"" angle but ah yes thats a trap because while it would have made the movie better for adult viewing just as with the Lucy-Gru attraction it would have completely alienated any young minds watching. A nine-year-old doesnt want anything to do with protective parental hijinks or adults dating so its understandable why ""Despicable Me 2"" is somewhat muddled because the intended audience ranges from seven to everybody else. Near the end of ""Despicable Me 2"" theres a musical interlude that slays and its clear that the creators of the film were just dying to get to this bit figuring (correctly) anyone who made it this far with a mere smirk would depart the theater with a huge smile.  ""Despicable Me 2"" is a generally effective sequel even if it often doesnt qualify as a stand-alone bastion of cinema. SCORE 6.3 / 10 Laremy wrote the book on film criticism and thinks parenting a young lady about to date boys would be a nightmare.

"Despicable Me 2 is a Minion mutiny review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesDespicable Me 2 is a Minion mutiny reviewDespicable Me 2 feels slightly less fresh and more formulaic than its predecessor. But its still fun.By Peter HowellMovie CriticTues. July 2 2013Despicable Me 2Animated comedy featuring the voices of Steve Carell Kristen Wiig Benjamin Bratt and Russell Brand. Directed by Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud. 98 minutes. Opens Wednesday at major theatres. G""Never get older"" gruff Gru lovingly tells the adorable Agnes in Despicable Me 2 and its a feeling viewers may share when approaching this animated comedy sequel.Despicable Me was a true original when it arrived in the summer of 2010. It surprised everybody with how much charm resided inside a curmudgeonly character who teased children froze adults and plotted to shrink and steal the moon. Turned out Grus heart was bigger than his ray gun.Article Continued BelowBut what begins as inspiration in Hollywood inevitably turns to calculation. So it is that Despicable Me 2 feels slightly less fresh and more formulaic than its predecessor. Despite Grus warning it has gotten older.The beguiling basics are still there including the goofy gadgets and sly references to other films. But there are a few major twists and changes of emphasis -- Grus babbling Minions once a sideshow now come close to stealing the show. The nimble Steve Carell still amusingly voices Gru the Transylvanian-tongued ex-villain who no longer lives up to the films title. Gru now embraces both fatherhood -- via his precocious adopted daughters Agnes (Elsie Fisher) Margo (Miranda Cosgrove) and Edith (Dana Gaier) -- and hes become more hero than scoundrel.The latter change is slightly less voluntary. Hes abducted by Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig) top agent for the Anti-Villain League who along with her lipstick Taser and her boss Steve Silas Ramsbottom (Steve Coogan) persuades Gru that the planet needs his help in battling a mysterious new bad guy.You may recall that in the first film the versatile Wiig previously voiced Miss Hattie the southern-accented scold in charge of the Home for Girls where the orphaned Agnes Margo and Edith previously resided.Wiigs Lucy is a considerably bigger and daffier presence in the sequel helping to up estrogen levels and to expand Grus heart ever further. Ken Jeong also returns in new guise this time as wigged-out wig store owner rather than a talk-show host. His characters Asian cliches are regrettable but theres company in the stereotyping department Benjamin Bratt unsubtly voices a Mexican restaurateur of dubious intent but Bratt at least has the excuse of being a last-minute replacement for Al Pacino who bailed late in production.Back for more of the same is Russell Brand as Dr. Nefario Grus goggle-eyed gadget guy. So are co-directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud who again also perform multiple duties as the garbled voices of Grus pint-sized yellow Minions now a bigger part of a lamentably thinner plot.Some despicable bean counter must have determined that the Minions were more popular than Gru because they threaten to overwhelm Despicable Me 2 especially when events conspire to have them change hues and plot coups.If you love the Minions youll at the very least like them here. Especially during their curtain-call antics during the credits where they demonstrate how well 3D can work (better than in the rest of the film) and also pimp for their spin-off The Minions Movie which is actually going to happen.It feels at times as if Despicable Me 2 actually is The Minions Movie. Coffin and Renaud and returning screenwriters Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio havent managed to come up with a dastardly plot to rival the shrinking and stealing of the moon from the previous film.Maybe thats because the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie this time and you know how that song goes.But the Minions are pretty funny not to mention hammy and they do get two crowd-pleasing musical numbers one set to the Village Peoples ""YMCA"" and another to the All-4-One/John Michael Montgomery ballad ""I Swear.""If all else fails just sing and dance.

( ) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Tuesday July 2 2013 1201 AM Title Despicable Me 2 Film Info With the voices of Steve Carell Kristen Wiig Animated sequel about a reformed villain and his family. Directors Pierre Coffin Chris Renaud (138). PG Crude humor action. Area theaters. Armed with masses of minions and an excess of adorability ""Despicable Me 2"" is guaranteed to charm anyone whos out of school and already bored. That this lively and sweet animated sequel lacks the subversive edge of the original is likely to go unnoticed by every viewer who just wants well more minions. And of course more Gru. Not even adults could get enough of Steve Carells impeccably accented villain -- or we should say former villain. Having reformed his ways in the original Gru now spends his days reading bedtime stories and planning birthday parties for his three adopted daughters (Miranda Cosgrove Dana Gaier and Elsie Fisher). But perhaps inevitably middle-aged parenthood has started to wear him down. He needs some excitement some adventure some -- dare he admit it? -- romance. All three arrive in his life courtesy of secret agent Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig) who enlists his help in finding the archvillain hiding at their local mall. Carell has a gift for exposing sentimentality in unexpected places and Gru -- who ranks among his best work -- remains as oddly touching as he was in the first film. A former rogue adjusting to life as a stay-at-home dad this Eastern European loner is poignantly unmoored amid his suburban setting. The rest of the voicework is first-rate too with amusing contributions from Benjamin Bratt Russell Brand and Steve Coogan. But the potty humor panders and Lucys broad goofiness is just an easy replacement for any interesting characteristics. More importantly the plot -- which lacks the creative quirkiness of the original -- feels like a device primarily designed to show off silly set pieces. Many of these of course involve Grus cheerful yellow helpers or minions (who naturally are even funnier when angry blue or naked). Theyre the reason youll be paying big bucks for that 3D ticket so make sure you stick around to watch them cause extra havoc through the closing credits.

When the first ""Despicable Me"" cartoon came out in 2010 it had a truly innovative look and a neat idea -- telling the story from the villains point of view -- that made it feel fresh. But the villain himself felt awfully familiar -- a fake Fester Addams living alone in an ornately gabled mansion. The film called him Gru but grow on you he never did. The first movie made money though -- if it didnt we wouldnt now be treated to ""Despicable Me 2."" And actually it is sort of a treat with many of the rough spots of the first film finally ironed out. For example Gru -- now a good guy kind of the way Jimmy Cagney joined the G-Men -- is developing his own non-Fester identity. The ""minions"" -- the bright yellow humanoid nubbins that do his bidding -- are more distinguishable too. And even better the nicely eccentric art -- characters turned into boldly geometric jumbles of cones and spheres perched on spindly legs -- has not only survived but thrived. In this new adventure Gru is recruited by a very ""Man From U.N.C.L.E."" group -- the Anti-Villain League -- to help track down the theft of a dangerous monster-making chemical. Lucy Wilde a tough trainee spy will be his partner. But he already has his prime suspect -- Eduardo Perez the owner of a mall cantina and Gru is sure the long-vanished still fearsome super-villain El Macho. Its silly stuff and perhaps too silly for some -- at the last minute Al Pacino who was providing Perez voice suddenly quit over ""creative differences."" Mull that one over yourself; personally Im flashing on Orson Welles famous ""frozen peas"" moment. (Go YouTube it.) Benjamin Bratt smoothly stepped in though and joined a good vocal cast that includes Steve Carell repeating his work as the oddly accented Gru Kristen Wiig as Lucy and new arrival Steve Coogan (busy week for Coogan and Carell) as the deep-wattled boss of the AVL. Theyre all fun as is the animation which once again has a very different and indefinably European flair (the French animation studio for the first episode Mac Guff was later gobbled up by Illumination Entertainment the producing company and returns here). A number of terrific visual moments stand out too. Like Grus triumphant ""(500) Days of Summer"" walk through town after he falls in love. Or a marvelously over-the-top dance Perez does in between dishing up salsa. Or the little mad minions themselves (the film makes good prankish use of its 3D). The films script unfortunately isnt nearly as inventive as its look; absolutely nothing happens in the last hour of the film that you cant have predicted within the first 20 minutes. And theres something a little sexist in the way many of the female characters are treated. But this is still not only a fun cartoon but -- that rare thing -- a sequel which actually improves on the original. Word is the studio already has plans for another installment. For once that doesnt sound like a threat. Ratings note The film contains some potty humor and a briefly bottomless minion. Despicable Me 2 (PG) Universal (98 min.) Directed by Pierre Coffin Chris Renaud. With the voices of Steve Carell Kristen Wiig.

Universal Pictures <<1>>Whenever Hollywood cranks out a sequel theres the danger it will suffer from a case of the terrible twos.""Despicable Me 2"" a chipper follow-up to the inventive 2010 animated hit mostly avoids that trap. While it isnt as touching or as exuberantly funny as the original its a cute summer diversion for kids with just enough wink-wink slyness and cheeky cinematic asides to hold the interests of older teens and adults. One those grounds its worth the price of a matinee admission. If you feel like paying more the 3-D is astonishingly good.It also fares better over other animated follow-ups by taking us on a new adventure without seeming superfluous or rote. Screenwriters Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul along with returning directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud realize they have a comic gold mine in Steve Carell (""The Office"") so they keep the focus on their supervillain-gone-supersoftie whos dealing with the challenges of being a good dad to three very cute girls. The filmmakers could have taken the easy way out turning Grus character bad again. Instead they introduce a refreshing love interest Lucy a go-get-em agent from the Anti Villain League. The zany Lucy is a most welcome addition and since shes played by the energetic Kristen Wiig of ""Bridesmaids"" youll be smitten too. As youd expect the Carell-Wiig matchup draws aces with Russell Brand as Grus right-hand man Dr. Nefario hitting some high notes.Advertisement Lucys alluring ways are partly responsible for coaxing Gru to join forces with the Anti Villain League. Theyre out to nab an evil mastermind in possession of a serum that when injected can transform anyone into an indestructible monster. If thats not silly enough the league has narrowed the location of suspects which include a rotund owner (Benjamin Bratt) of a Mexican restaurant to one mall. So its up to Gru and Lucy with the assistance of Grus yellow little digit-like minions (scene-stealers as usual) to ferret out the bad guy. The ""Mission Impossible"" sendup is good enough with individual scenes -- Grus date with a fitness fanatic is a comic highlight -- proving to be even better than the spy references. And while directors Coffin and Renaud have trouble with pacing in patches the finale is a lot of zany fun when the dimwitted minions undergo a personality change and turn purple and fierce. But is any of this flat-out hilarious? One or two scenes are. ""Despicable Me 2"" is more often amusing. And on a hot summer day in July when the kids are bored being amusing might be just the refuge a parent needs.DESPICABLE ME 2    Rating PG (for rude humor and mild action)Starring Steve Carell Kristen Wiig Benjamin Bratt Russell BrandDirectors Pierre Coffin and Chris RenaudRunning time 1 hour 38 minutes Print Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Review Holocaust haunts family in The GatheringReview In Hearts of Palm bumbling corporation aims to plunder paradiseReview In Bad Moms fast food and booze spike the stress of motherhood Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

Now he dotes over his three adopted daughters--Margo Edith and Agnes--while concocting a new jelly recipe with his gibberish-speaking Minions (they of the yellow skin and varying number of eyes). But then the crime-fighting Anti-Villain League comes calling Seems theres a new anonymous bad guy in town and Gru along with fetching fellow agent Lucy (Kristen Wiig) are the best candidates to stop him or her. A fleeter film than its predecessor Despicable Me 2 delights more often than it disappoints. With Grus unctuously irritable personality already established codirectors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud let their loony imaginations run wild Where else will you find a movie that references the point-and-scream alien call from the 1978 Invasion of the Body Snatchers while also making room for a hilarious Minions-performed rendition of ""I Swear""? The gags take precedence over the perfunctory plot and the overarching theme about Gru and his girls search for a mother figure is too undercooked. But Carell and Wiig make a splendid vocal pair--Nick and Nora Charles with ice guns and lipstick Tasers--and the candy-colored 3-D animation is always enthralling whether Gru is presiding over a birthday party gone awry or fighting back a horde of hairy purple monsters with a taste for well anything in their path. All this and a (sorta) Village People cameo too? Not so despicable after all.

The lovable Minions enjoy a treat in this animated sequel (Illumination Entertainment) C Despicable Me 2 Genre Animation; Starring Steve Carell Kristen Wiig Al Pacino; Director Chris Renaud Pierre Coffin; Release Date Wide 07/03/2013; Runtime (in minutes) 98; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor Universal Pictures Posted July 12 2013 -- 1200 AM EDT Gru the bald and beetle-browed rascal hero of Despicable Me 2 is an infectious imp -- as voiced by Steve Carell he?s like Uncle Fester with the personality of Nikita Khrushchev. But in the first Despicable Me (2010) he was a supervillain with a grand plan (he wanted to steal the moon) and in the surprisingly toothless sequel he has been neutered into a boring nice guy. The co-directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud create a seductively tactile computer-animated landscape in which gentle slapstick rules the day. For some reason though they have mostly left out the flashes of egomaniacal dastardliness that even a movie for kids can thrive on (e.g. the far superior Will Ferrell animation Megamind). Kristen Wiig voices Lucy the Anti-Villain League agent who has a crush on Gru and recruits him to be a spy. You keep waiting for Wiig to display some of her flaked-out inspiration but she too has been given almost nothing to play but sweetness and light. The best thing in the movie is the army of chattery yellow minions who are injected with a serum that transforms them into gnashing purple beasties. By the end every child in the audience will want his or her own monster-minion toy. Adults will just regret the way that Despicable Me 2 betrays the original film?s devotion to bad-guy gaiety.

With sequels to Monsters Inc and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs also on the way the multiplex is a veritable Sesame Street of cuddly familiarity. Quite what kids stand to learn from this loud broad and disjointedly amusing follow-up to the 2010 surprise hit is open to question. But its repetitive qualities are beyond reproach. Every bit as amiable and disposable as its predecessor it recycles everything from slapstick gags to its own voice cast (Kristen Wiig pops up again but as an entirely different character). The first film ended with Steve Carells reformed Russian supervillain Gru settling down with his sickly-sweet trio of adopted daughters. Here hes still trying to go straight with an unpromising business making jellies and jams in the pipeline. The MI6-style Anti-Villain League however has other plans. Enter goofy secret agent Lucy (Wiig) to whisk Gru into a madcap scheme to take down an unidentified despot with dastardly designs on Grus cute cackling horde of canary-yellow minions. Right down to the closing-credits audition for their upcoming spin-off feature the frantic antics of these critters are scarcely disguised as the films raison detre. The human activity including Gru and Lucys appealing but half-baked romance is strictly to get us from A to well A. Youngsters wont mind. Their parents will be as charmed or annoyed - or maybe both - as they were the first time.

The film starts very well and for the first half an hour is on top form. Thereafter it really goes astray. A frankly disappointing mid third that at best could be described as dull and probably better as poor sees the film lose its way with the parent angst over teen love storyline. It gets better towards the end and the last five minutes had me crying with laughter. In places superb often involving the minions sadly superb in far too few places but generally OK. I was disappointed as I am sure will many who loved the first film. The kids will probably love it but a good 3 star film that could and should have been better.

TWITTER The sequel to the Universal hit sees Kristin Wiig join Steve Carells Gru on a mission of Looney Tunes-style nuttiness. Stealing the moon can be a tough act to follow as reformed criminal mastermind Gru and the creative team behind the 540-million-grossing 2010 smash Despicable Me discovered when it was time to dream up an encore. After all it was no mean feat to successfully juggle all that lunar lunacy with a delightful companion plot involving a trio of orphaned girls who in turn steal Grus heart. While the new edition doesnt quite catch that inspired spark theres still plenty to enjoy here courtesy of those zippy visuals and a pitch-perfect voice cast led by the innately animated Steve Carell. STORY Monsters Despicable Me 2 Turbo Summers Brutal Animation War Expect the movies minions to once again turn up in droves with Australian and various European June bows setting the stage for a certain-to-be stellar Fourth of July holiday weekend. Despicable Me 2 finds Carells Gru more or less embracing his newly domesticated life after adopting Margo (Miranda Cosgrove) Edith (Dana Gaier) and little Agnes (Elsie Fisher) even swapping his more nefarious activities for a start-up jelly-and-jam-making operation. But he soon finds himself in a stickier situation when hes dispatched by the top-secret Anti-Villain League to track down the perpetrator of a fresh heist involving a ginormous electromagnet. Setting up an undercover operation in a mall cupcake shop Gru is reunited with fresh AVL recruit Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig formerly the proprietor of Miss Hatties Home for Girls) with his suspicions set on the gregarious owner of a Mexican restaurant (a terrific Benjamin Bratt) who bears a nagging resemblance to El Macho a notorious villain believed to have perished while riding a shark into a volcano with 250 pounds of TNT strapped to his chest. Its those sort of details that lend the Despicable Me franchise an irresistible Looney Tunes-style nuttiness--one even more prevalent this time around in the absence of a more substantial plotline. Still returning directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud and the returning writing team of Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul again maintain the energy at a brisk buoyant clip while Carell and the rest of cast add an extra layer of dimension to those expressively drawn characters. Also amusingly returning to the fold is Russell Brand as rickety resident mad scientist Dr. Nefario Steve Coogan as AVL head honcho Silas Ramsbottom and Ken Jeong as Floyd Eagle-san now the owner of a wig store. Back again to imbue the production with a pleasing visual and aural snap are production designer Yarrow Cheney and on-a-roll Pharrell Williams whose springy songs blend nicely with Heitor Pereiras bright score. Those who foolishly opt to leave at the start of the end credits will be missing out on another entertaining 3D demonstration again led by a handful of those wacky Minions.

Bound to exceed its predecessor at the box office Universal/Illuminations endearing if slightly less inspired sequel finds the still-surly Gru just lonely enough to accommodate a love interest -- the missing ingredient in this unconventional family portrait. After reluctantly admitting that he made a second-rate baddie at best Steve Carells overcompensating character gets a chance to prove himself a first-class hero providing ample opportunity for comic support from his Minions. While not quite as charming or unique as the original ""Despicable Me 2"" comes awfully close extending co-directors Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffins delightfully silly sensibility to a bit larger universe. The story picks up shortly after it left off with Gru repurposing his arsenal of fearsome inventions to keep his three adopted daughters entertained. Meanwhile his highly adaptable crew of gibberish-spouting Minions do double duty alternating between glorified babysitters and elbow grease on Grus latest enterprise developing a line of delicious jellies and jams. The setups good for a few jokes -- and writing duo Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio keep em coming at a steady pace -- but its clear that much of this reformed villains talents are going untapped. Thats where secret agent Lucy Wilde comes in. Voiced by Kristen Wiig but behaving like an elastic version of that googly eyed pitch gal from the Progressive Insurance spots Lucy represents an organization called the Anti-Villain League that seeks to recruit Gru. Tall and gangly with a massive schnoz Lucy is not just Grus equal in nearly every way but obviously his romantic match as well -- a position the script not-so-subtly suggests is vacant as early as Grus first scene. In fact while the pic goes out of its way to concoct an elaborate plot involving a top-secret transmutation serum stolen from the Arctic Circle and stashed somewhere in a shopping mall the unnecessarily complicated scenario clearly serves to bring this odd couple together. This storyline also cleverly satisfies a second objective devising an expanded role for the Minions without letting the little yellow scene-stealers completely abscond with the show. After all the Minions have a feature of their own in the works (a fact the film rather obnoxiously reminds during an end-credits ""audition"" sequence that severely tests ones tolerance for these overly slapsticky buggers) which no doubt explains the modest attempts to distinguish between their personalities here. Whereas so much CG animation loses sight of -- or in some cases outright rejects -- its connection to the classic hand-drawn cartoon tradition the Illumination Mac Guff-made ""Despicable Me"" franchise fully embraces the loony design zany humor and impossible physics pioneered by Hanna-Barbera Friz Freleng and Chuck Jones. The result may lack DreamWorks visual wow factor or the rich emotional connection Pixar consistently achieves but it never forgets to have fun putting amusement as its highest priority. Renaud and Coffin fully commit to this oddly old-fashioned agenda presenting a world where a top-heavy hunchback on spindly little legs can be twisted into pretzels when the situation demands. Their playful attitude extends to the voices which account for much of the pics appeal. That certainly goes for the Minions (whom the helmers perform themselves adding a hilarious form of nonsense-singing to their repertoire) and for such new additions as Ken Jeong Steve Coogan and Benjamin Bratt. Bratt reportedly came aboard as a last-minute substitution for Al Pacino though youd never guess he wasnt the filmmakers first choice for the role of El Macho the swarthy lead suspect in Grus undercover investigation into the theft of the serum. Like Gru El Macho is a former villain whom fatherhood has forced into a lower-profile existence -- in his case managing a Mexican restaurant at the mall. Meanwhile with Gru distracted by his own budding romance eldest daughter Margo (Miranda Cosgrove) falls for El Machos hipster son Antonio (Moises Arias) severely compromising Grus objectivity in the case. Parents whove sat through enough recent studio toons will surely appreciate the way ""Despicable Me 2"" divides its allegiance evenly between the grown-up and kid characters rather than pandering to the youngsters. Taking advantage of the 3D format and Pharrell Williams funky theme the creative team keeps things moving although certain story threads remain unresolved amid the toons rush to entertain. Along the way the pic ditches the mall location and abandons Gru and Lucys cupcake-making cover stories (correctly) assuming that Minion cover versions of ""I Swear"" and ""YMCA"" will excuse the fact the endeavor lacks a proper ending.
