"Pluto A Shaggy Dog Story With Fleas washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Movies Pluto A Shaggy Dog Story With Fleas Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Saturday August 17 2002 They forgot to put something in Eddie Murphys new film ""The Adventures of Pluto Nash."" They forgot to put in the entertainment. The result is something quite rare in professional show business 1 1/2 hours of pure blankness. Its there but its not there. It is but it isnt. It has nothing to offer. Its not forgettable really because theres nothing to forget. This is a philosophically different proposition from and much rarer than simple badness. A bad movie usually has traces of someones ideal dream of it inside and if you try hard you can begin to understand why somebody thought it would work. ""The Adventures of Pluto Nash"" lacks that quality entirely; it feels like a comedy some malicious editor cut all the laughs out of or a thriller in which the same satanic monster deleted all thrills. Its just you know random behavior. The pitch must have been something like this. ""See the hero is a nightclub owner fighting a mobster who wants to take over his place. But heres the wacky part Its on the moon"" If this clown didnt get chucked out of Warners on his ear then heads should roll. Well maybe they already have. Evidently its been sitting on a shelf for more than a year and even Murphy himself has voted thumbs down refusing to do any publicity for it. Who can blame him? Directed by the underwhelming Ron Underwood who had a hit in 1990 with ""Tremors"" and not since its extremely lame but thats all right because its too long also. Barely trying Murphy plays Nash the nightclub owner in a cheesy ""Little America"" a moon colony in the year 2087 that bears a shocking resemblance to that big mall in Anne Arundel County. You know the one. Really ugly. Oh so depressing. Anyhow Nash has gangster problems girlfriend problems mama problems and worst of all robot problems. His android is named Bruno and he is impersonated gamely by Randy Quaid. I say this with regret because Quaid is one of those yeomen who never quite become stars but who try hard and generate laughs wherever they are placed. But this is the worst performance by a professional actor I have ever seen in 20 years of full-time moviegoing. His eyes bulging brightly his throat tightened like hes just swallowed a guppy his body language so stiff you suspect someone injected industrial strength pumice into all his joints his voice childishly modulated hes a one-man horror show. Someone who takes money for his judgment thought this grotesquerie was funny? Really baffling. The plot is simplistic none of the other performers is paying much attention and the scene in which space cars chase each other through moon canyons has got to be the worst special effects sequence since King Kongs robot mitt picked up Fay Wray in the big monkey picture of 1933. I could go on but theres no point to it since there was never any point to ""Pluto Nash"" to begin with. The Adventures of Pluto Nash (90 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for generic violence and sexual language.

"`Pluto Nash An Utter Waste Of Space - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Eddie Murphy `Pluto Nash An Utter Waste Of SpaceMovies - REVIEW - The Adventures of Pluto NashEven An All-star Cast Cant Save This Stinker. Its Easily The Biggest Flop Of The Summer.August 30 2002|By Roger Moore Sentinel Staff WriterSome movies are released the old joke goes. And some ""escape.""And some like The Adventures of Pluto Nash are quietly slipped out the back door of the summer movie season -- late August -- a total write-off of 22 years of development and 100 million in budget.Hard to believe that a movie with Eddie Murphy Randy Quaid Alec Baldwin Joe Pantoliano John Cleese Burt Young Jay Mohr Peter Boyle and Pam Grier in it one written by the loon who concocted Mystery Men and directed by the reliably amusing Ron Underwood-- of City Slickers Tremors and Heart and Souls -- could be utterly laugh free.But it is.In development since 1980 filmed by the then-hot Eddie Murphy for an April 2001 release cut recut tinkered with and production-designed to within an inch of its life Pluto Nash was released two weeks ago to . . . silence. Warner Brothers didnt show it to reviewers in advance. Nobody involved did the TV talk-show rounds.A huge TV ad blitz didnt help. Audiences saw the signs. And Pluto opened to numbers the studios havent seen since well Town amp; Country Ishtar Rollerball and Howard the Duck. Suppose they made a 100 million movie and nobody came? They have and nobody did. The movie may make as little as 5 million making it the biggest flop of the summer surpassing the absurdly expensive Stuart Little 2.But is it as bad as all that? Oh yes. Murphy plays another in a long line of smooth con-men in this comic thriller set 85 years in the future. Plutos a nightclub owner on the moon on the run from mobsters who want to take over his property and turn it into a casino.Randy Quaid plays a robot. Peter Boyle is a streetwise hustler. Pam Grier plays Plutos mom John Cleese is an electronic chauffeur the list goes on. Worth noting comic and abrasive sports talk personality Jay Mohrs career-threatening performance as a lounge singer. He might consider going into hiding. Oh wait hes in Pluto Nash the next best thing.Set in the present on Earth this would have been a 50 million bad idea -- Murphys check alone ran to 20 million. Set on the moon with special effects dazzling crowded sets and a cast of hundreds the bad idea is stretched out to 100 million.In 1996 after years of lazy sloppy expensive flops Murphy was gifted with a comeback thanks to The Nutty Professor and then Dr. Dolittle. He used that Hollywood goodwill to make the prison comedy Life to take a terrific small turn in Bowfinger and do voices in Mulan and Shrek.But he also made Showtime lame sequels to Dolittle and Nutty and the coming big-screen I Spy which doesnt look promising from the trailer that showed before Pluto.In the winner-take-all economy of todays movie business when most studios are gambling everything on making a load of dough that first weekend movie stars are supposed to be what makes people line up on opening day. And even though no star could have saved this under-plotted joke-free comedy you have to wonder who in Hollywood still thinks Murphys worth 20 million?Its not his acting that makes him suspect though he plainly doesnt try very hard any more. Its his judgment. If he cant pick winners what does his name mean on the marquee?""Stinker.""

Photo HANDOUT Far-out Murphy forgets where Planet Funny is located 1 / 1 Back to Gallery THE ADVENTURES OF PLUTO NASH Action/sci-fi comedy. Starring Eddie Murphy Randy Quaid Rosario Dawson Joe Pantoliano Jay Mohr Pam Grier John Cleese and Luis Guzman. Directed by Ron Underwood. Written by Neil Cuthbert. (Rated PG-13. 96 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Formulaic films are released every week but its rare that one has a 100 million budget big stars whose roles are embarrassing to watch and unusual special effects that only serve to mask a predictable plot and cliche-ridden scenes. ""The Adventures of Pluto Nash"" is a new low for Eddie Murphy director Ron Underwood and nearly everyone associated with it but for the sake of offering something positive heres this The images of Earth are fantastic. In ""Pluto Nash"" Murphys title character plays a nightclub owner who lives on the moon. Its the year 2087 and mankind has colonized its lunar surface and turned it into a surreal Las Vegas-like outpost where casinos and cheesy entertainment spots compete for peoples attention. Nash turns down a request to sell his club to a corrupt businessman named Rex Crater who blows it up. Nash survives the pyrotechnics and for the rest of the movie Nash the clubs new waitress (Rosario Dawson) and their big bald bodyguard robot (Randy Quaid) try to track down Crater before he succeeds in killing them. Thats it. Thats the plot. Of course sparks develop between Nash and the waitress whos an aspiring singer and of course there are big chase scenes and of course Nash and the bad guys have lots of futuristic guns that they fire with abandon and of course in the end some good and happy things happen. I wont tell you what those good and happy things are (that would spoil the film right?) but lets just add this The conclusion is as insipid as the rest of the movie. Back to the positive When Nashs trio leaves the moons domed quadrant (called ""Moon Beach"") and drives on underdeveloped surfaces the shots of Earth are inspiring. Surrounded by heavenly stars the Earth is a colorful ball of green blue and white in contrast to the moons dark and mysterious hues. On Earth we are told the year 2087 will have heralded a technological and cultural revolution where everyone has the ability to instantly clone themselves travel into space via retroactive vehicles and hire robots who actually have feelings and needs. The male robots are all big and bald; the female robots are all sexy vacuous and provocatively dressed. What a concept. We have to give ""Pluto Nash"" some more credit. Not every woman in the film is a dumb sex object. The paper money that people use has a portrait of Hillary Clinton -- an indication Clinton had won the presidency at some point and established a legacy of monumental work. The trailers for ""Pluto Nash"" play up a scene involving the currency (Murphys character calls them ""Hillaries"") which is supposed to be funny but in the screening this reviewer attended no one laughed. Before it opened on Friday Warner Brothers didnt make ""Pluto Nash"" available to critics apparently fearing they would savage a film that was reworked and repeatedly delayed after its scheduled release 16 months ago. If ""Pluto Nash"" turns into a critical and commercial flop life will go on for Murphy Underwood Dawson Quaid John Cleese (who plays a chauffeur) Jay Mohr (who plays a lounge singer who -- by default -- is the movies most interesting character) and the other actors and crew. Lets just hope theyve learned their lesson Big budgets and big names dont guarantee anything -- not on Earth and not on any futuristic lunar surface. . This film has violence and strong language.

On that august occasion The Adventures of Pluto Nash will not be mentioned.A paralyzingly dopey mess Pluto sat on the shelf for more than a year while Warner Bros. tried to inject some life into it. You might as well try to revive a stuffed moose.In this rancid bit of sci-fry Murphy plays the title character a former smuggler who owns the hottest nightclub on the moon. Its all champagne and kisses until a mysterious crime kingpin decides to squeeze Nash out of business.The story is set in the year 2080 - although fashions music and slang havent changed one bit. Its comforting to know that Tito Puente references will still have currency in 78 years.Pluto sets out to confront his enemy face to face. The reclusive lunar mastermind is named Rex Crater a gag that would have struck The Flintstones writers as too obvious. Pluto is joined in his search by the aspiring singer Dina (Rosario Dawson). Who knows why these two are thrown together. The movie parachutes characters into the plot with only the flimsiest rationales.Meager comic relief is provided by Randy Quaid as Bruno Plutos obsolete bodyguard robot. With his shaved head grease-pencil eyebrows and badly stitched suit Bruno looks like a sharkskin Frankenstein.Whenever the script runs out of ideas (about every two minutes) it throws in a chase or fight. Nothing novel there. That solution can be traced back as far as Tom Mix serials but rarely has it been as hackneyed and dreary as in Pluto Nash. The action is abysmal like a bad arcade game. And its carried out on cheap claustrophobic sets that look like leftovers from Arnold Schwarzeneggers Total Recall.Alec Baldwin has an uncredited appearance as a crude mobster. Its amazing that other actors such as Peter Boyle Pam Grier and John Cleese didnt also demand to have their names excised from this embarrassment. But theyre closer to retirement age than Baldwin so maybe they need all the Screen Actors Guild credits they can muster.Jay Mohr plays a nightclub singer named Tony Francis. Its the worst Sinatra knockoff since Sid Vicious stumbled through ""My Way."" Near the films anticlimax Nash bursts into Tonys dressing room after a show and demands ""Who do you see about a refund?""Thats a question that will be on many moviegoers minds.Contact David Hiltbrand at 215-854-4875 or dhiltbrandphillynews.com.The Adventures of Pluto Nash  (Out of four stars)Produced by Martin Bregman Michael Bregman and Louis A.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The Adventures Of Pluto Nash comes to theaters with at least two strikes against it Its been languishing in a studio vault for two years gathering dust and bad press and it wasnt screened for critics which is never a good sign. Add a title and publicity campaign to rival Howard The Duck for sheer wrongheadedness and the result is a film likely to be dead on arrival. Only the films supporting cast--which includes such dependable character actors as Pam Grier John Cleese Burt Young Jay Mohr Joe Pantoliano and Luis Guzman--provides the faintest glimmer of hope. The film itself makes that glimmer vanish. A waste of talent and money Pluto Nash seems convinced that simply sticking Eddie Murphy in outer space with expensive special effects will produce laughs. It expects the high-concept idea to do the films work for it and when it doesnt all thats left is a headache-inducing mess without direction or purpose. In perhaps his most tepid performance to date Murphy stars as a former space smuggler and ex-con who now owns a popular nightclub on the moon. But his happy life is upset when bad guys try to buy him out or failing that kill him. Listlessly directed by Ron Underwood Pluto Nash is set in a lunar Vegas that suggests a number of promising comic possibilities all of them studiously avoided in favor of mild gags delivered at a leisurely pace. A trash-heap of secondhand ideas and characters Pluto Nash doesnt even rip off good movies choosing instead to plunder the questionable likes of Heartbeeps and Knight Rider. The flamboyantly ugly production design is bound to induce Battlefield Earth flashbacks but that film at least boasted too much ambition The aggressively mild Pluto Nash seems to take its cues from its stars sleepy lead performance. Long gone are the days when Murphy could coast on charisma alone and here hed need to kick it up a notch just to qualify as phoning it in. Pluto Nash has another connection to Battlefield Earth Like fellow icon John Travolta Murphy has a knack for spectacular comebacks. Unfortunately he also shares Travoltas tendency to choose projects that make those comebacks necessary.

With Eddie Murphy Randy Quaid Rosario Dawson Joe Pantoliano. Directed by Ron Underwood. Running time 95 mins. Rated PG-13 Violence sexual humor. 1 1/2 Stars Eddie Murphys latest comedy ""The Adventures of Pluto Nash"" takes place in the year 2087 which is about the earliest he can hope to be forgiven. The ceaselessly unfunny film which is said to have cost north of 100 million and has been languishing in postproduction hell for more than a year stars a languid Murphy as a reformed smuggler and nightclub operator on the moon. He runs Club Pluto a hip-hop joint in the gravity bubble known as Little America. Taking cues from ""Casablanca"" the filmmakers fashioned Pluto after Humphrey Bogarts Rick with whom Pluto shares a certain insouciance and enigmatic charm two qualities rarely associated with Murphy. Plutos sidekick is a relatively antiquated 2063 robot named Bruno (Randy Quaid poor fool) and his love interest is Dina Lake (Rosario Dawson) a would-be diva working her way back to Earth. Pluto was on Earth once he tells her. The only thing he liked about it was the view of the moon. Ba-da-boom. The plot is set in motion by an order from a mob boss Rex to buy out Club Pluto and corner the lunar casino business. When Pluto refuses to sell thugs arrive with curiously ineffective popguns and the chase is on. Much of that 100 million budget is on the screen - the sets look great. Little America is a little Vegas with touches from Times Square and ""Blade Runners"" L.A. Its good to know that if we have to leave Earth someday we wont have to go without our kitsch. Forensics experts will be digging through the rubble of this fiasco for a long time trying to reconstruct the accident. How did so many lines fall flat? Why were the action scenes so corny and unconvincing? Who put the stink on this? There is one amusing moment and if you insist on spending 10 to be surprised by it stop reading now. When Rexs emissaries try to buy Plutos club they hand him a stack of bills with Hillary Clintons image on them. So thats why Earth was evacuated. Ba-da-boom.

Comments The Adventures of Pluto Nash Another zillion-dollar dud. Eddie Murphy plays the title character a reformed smuggler on the surface of the moon in 2087 whose dance club has been targeted for takeover by an organized-crime kingpin. (Apparently the plot of Harlem Nights has been cryogenically preserved.) Randy Quaid has a few funny moments as Nashs robotic bodyguard and John Cleese delivers some good lines as the virtual chauffeur of a stolen limousine. Screenwriter Neil Cuthbert also penned the quirky superhero comedy Mystery Men but the crowd I saw this with had trouble finding anything to laugh at and I left the theater depressed to realize that when we finally travel to distant galaxies theyll wind up looking like Planet Hollywood. Director Ron Underwood squanders a terrific cast including Jay Mohr Joe Pantoliano Peter Boyle Pam Grier Illeana Douglas Luis Guzman Burt Young James Rebhorn and Rosario Dawson as Murphys predictably light-skinned love interest. 96 min.

Its boring. Its flat. Its ugly. Worst of all for a comedy its not even remotely funny. But it isnt so abominable that Warner Bros. needed to withhold it from us prior to opening day. Not showing us a movie like ""Pluto Nash"" -- starring Eddie Murphy as a nightclub owner on the moon in 2087-- makes us wonder whats wrong with it and provokes stories like the one in this weeks USA Today which catalogued Murphys uneven film choices in recent years. All this attention could have been avoided however just by letting us see the stupid thing. If you plan on seeing ""The Adventures of Pluto Nash"" -- and using the word ""adventures"" in the title was wishful thinking on the filmmakers part -- there are some basic things you should know. Its a massive waste of talented actors who surely had better things to do with their time including Peter Boyle Illeana Douglas Luis Guzman Joe Pantoliano Pam Grier John Cleese and Burt Young. Comedian Jay Mohrs in it too as an accordion-playing kilt-wearing lounge singer who performs at a dive bar on the moon -- but watching Mohr do his famous Christopher Walken impersonation for an hour and a half would have been more entertaining. There is however one very funny cameo by Alec Baldwin in which he pokes fun at his run-ins with the paparazzi. To laugh out loud just once is incredibly refreshing -- but its not worth the price of admission. ""Pluto Nash"" also looks surprisingly muddled considering it was shot by Oliver Wood a cinematographer with more than three decades of experience on films including ""Face/Off"" and this years ""The Bourne Identity."" Everything is blanketed in a grimy gray haze -- and yeah it takes place on the moon but it didnt have to be dreary. Director Ron Underwood (""City Slickers"") doesnt get much out of the sight gags either because theyre not terribly inspired. Among them Plutos habit of carrying moist towelettes wherever he goes. 10000 bills with Hillary Rodham Clintons face on them. A video phone that was innovative back when ""The Jetsons"" debuted in 1962. A human-looking robot dressed as a French maid who repeatedly drops her feather duster and bends over slowly to pick it up. A cryogenically preserved Chihuahua that thaws when placed in a microwave oven. And then theres the plot (which isnt really important because it functions solely to set up the lame sight gags) A mob boss pressures Pluto to sell his nightclub because he wants to buy it and turn it into a casino. Pluto outsmarts him with the help of Dina (Rosario Dawson) a beautiful singer hes just hired and his robot bodyguard Bruno (Randy Quaid). The movie is reminiscent of another one that Neil Cuthbert wrote 1999s ""Mystery Men"" about a ragtag band of superheroes. It also had a big talented cast (Ben Stiller Janeane Garafalo William H. Macy Eddie Izzard Greg Kinnear and Geoffrey Rush) who were all dressed up with nowhere to go. ""Pluto Nash"" has nowhere to go but the video store after the briefest of runs in theaters.

Posted August 14 2002 -- 1200 AM EDT Theres one way that The Adventures of Pluto Nash an action comedy set on the moon seems truly lunar It isnt weighed down by jokes. In the 21st century America sets up a satellite colony that looks like a triple-decker shopping mall built entirely out of discarded hunks of aluminum siding. If only someone had discarded the script As Pluto Nash a stylishly attired opportunist who attempts to hunt down the gangster who blew up his nightclub Eddie Murphy delivers his lines with that weirdly relaxed fake-enthusiastic bonhomie that telegraphs just below the surface a what-am-I-doing-here? bafflement desperate enough to match Elvis Presleys in his worst bombs. Every 15 minutes or so we get a stale crumb of back-to-the-future satire that would have been dated even if the movie had been released on schedule a year ago - Hillary Clinton on a 10000 bill a reference to the intersection of Microsoft and Sixth and so on. How on earth or anywhere else did director Ron Underwood manage to blow 100 million on this? The one lively element is Randy Quaid bald and towering with hypno-eyes and a 50s robot voice as a silver-suited droid who looks like he should have been called Maxi-Me.

"`Pluto dog of a role for Murphy - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs `Pluto dog of a role for MurphyAugust 17 2002|By Robert K. Elder Tribune staff reporter.Following the tepid ""Showtime"" and the flat-lined ""Dr. Dolittle 2"" ""Pluto Nash"" invokes the three-strikes-and-youre-out rule that if nothing else puts Eddie Murphy in underdog status for a third comeback.Here Murphy stars as the title character a former smuggler getting squeezed out by mob forces that want his successful moon-based nightclub. When Pluto refuses to make way for their casino empire pinstriped thug Morgan (Joe Pantoliano) torches his establishment. With a price on his head Pluto drags antiquated robot bodyguard Bruno (Randy Quaid) and aspiring nightclub chanteuse Dina Lake (Rosario Dawson) all over the dark side of the moon fleeing from then pursuing mysterious gangster boss Rex Crater.For all the gunplay and explosions ""Pluto Nash"" just kind of floats there adrift in space. Director Ron Underwood (""Mighty Joe Young"") cant quite light the fire under his actors nor build tension in the chase. And while some of the jokes are clever (such as a pushy seductive slot machine that pursues its prey) they induce only smirks and no real belly laughs. It might be the first sci-fi comedy that could benefit from a ""Threes Company""-style laugh track.Cameos from Pam Grier (as Plutos mom) and John Cleese (as the stuffy computer of a moon car) promise to spice up the plot but dont. Characters seem to float around bumping into one another inside the frame. Production Designer Bill Brzeski cannibalizes other futurist films such as ""Blade Runner"" and pours on a shiny layer of plastic offering up some ridiculously fashionable space suits.Murphy himself remains enjoyably understated cool and even reserved compared to his hyper star-making turns in ""Trading Places"" and the excellent ""Coming to America."" Its commendable for Murphy to tone his persona down to lose himself inside the manic neon future envisioned in hundreds of sci-fi films. But a down-to-earth Murphy doesnt work on the moon. In the end he seems just as weightless and vacuous as the rest of the film.""The Adventures of Pluto Nash"" (star) 1/2Directed by Ron Underwood; screenplay by Neil Cuthbert; photographed by Oliver Wood; edited by Paul Hirsch and Alan Heim; production design by Bill Brzeski; produced by Martin Bregman Michael Bregman and Louis A.

Expect a soft landing for ""The Adventures of Pluto Nash"" an inconsequential futuristic action-comedy lensed more than two years ago and originally planned for release 14 months ago. Unceremoniously dropped into theaters sans press screenings by distrib Warners this Eddie Murphy showcase puts the actor in the familiar role playing a funnyman who can shoot guns and chase bad guys but the proper mix is never found. Ill-conceived and expensive project that winds up looking like a bunch of talented thesps slumming it ""Pluto"" will be quickly eclipsed in the August B.O. wars reemerging for modest vid biz. Weak ""Casablanca""-like premise of a nightclub owner who must deal with threats from intruders or lose his business is married to the clever depiction of a lunar colony circa 2080 with a hip urban America feel thats realized with lots of digital help. Still its a world that would have looked much fresher if it had appeared as was originally intended prior to ""A.I."" Comedy should be the coin of this lunar realm but opening scene doesnt deliver; Murphy as ex-con and ace smuggler Pluto Nash sits through a bad set of ""Scottish crooning"" by buddy Tony (Jay Mohr). When Pluto discovers mobster Gino (Burt Young) is torturing Tony over an old debt Pluto offers to pay it but wants Tonys club in return. Seven years later Club Pluto is the hottest thing in the bustling lunar burg of Little America attracting both guys like henchman Mogan (Joe Pantoliano) who tells Pluto that his boss a reclusive but powerful gambling kingpin wants to buy the club to turn it into a casino -- and dolls like beautiful out-of-work singer Dina (Rosario Dawson) who wants a gig but gets only a waitress job out of Pluto. Adding a surreal touch is Plutos robot bodyguard Bruno (Randy Quaid) whose presence eventually proves grating. This light tone is rudely interrupted by Mogans albino henchman Kelp (Victor Varnado) who leads a bombing of Club Pluto and a laser-gun shootout that miraculously leaves Pluto Bruno and the helpful Dina unscathed. Further detective work with help from ex-cop Rowland (Peter Boyle) puts Pluto and Dina on the scent of Mogans boss but not without some action involving Plutos mom (Pam Grier doing a futuristic riff on her Coffy persona) more shootouts and chases and more shtick that doesnt stick. One senses production designer Bill Brzeski and his large crew of artists had a whole lot more fun making their future world than did Murphy and the cast -- who go through their paces with barely a chance for genuinely inventive comedy -- had acting in it. Even John Cleese on board as the live-action face of the computer in a souped-up car stolen by Pluto simply does a riff on a British butler of the sort he could do in his sleep. Murphys perf is such an obvious replay of his many comic cop roles that it screams for a variation that never comes -- and that includes a climactic tussle with himself as an evil clone. Mohr cooks up a respectable Sinatra act and having Pantoliano as the thuggish bad guy Young as a Mafioso and Luis Guzman as a cocky Puerto Rican illustrates the projects tendency to typecast good talent. Alec Baldwin has fun in a brief cameo as a nasty East Coast mobster. Dawson is pics most refreshing element yet another case of this utterly charming and pleasant actress asked to play the grace notes in an inert comedy. While an obvious amount of money and time went into the extensive effects director Ron Underwood doesnt realize the visual potential of the deliberate anachronism of placing Earth-like things on the moon. Oliver Woods lensing adheres to the standard Hollywood comedy principle of the more light the better but in this context it doesnt work.

Kevin Courrier Special to The Globe and Mail Published Saturday Aug. 17 2002 1200AM EDT Last updated Saturday Mar. 21 2009 1259AM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The Adventures of Pluto Nash Directed by Ron Underwood Written by Neil Cuthbert Starring Eddie Murphy and Randy Quaid Classification PG Rating  The title The Adventures of Pluto Nashis something of a misnomer -- theres nothing very adventurous or heroic happening here. Consider it instead a lame attempt to wed a thirties gangster pastiche (with romantic shadings of Casablanca and To Have and Have Not) to a sci-fi adventure story. What we get is a limp Eddie Murphy vehicle that even he seems embarrassed to be part of. Ron Underwood ( City Slickers) directs like a traffic cop caught in rush hour desperately trying to keep motorists from colliding into each other. The story takes place on the moon in a place called Little America in 2080. Pluto Nash (Eddie Murphy) is a former smuggler who has turned nightclub owner and he owns the hottest spot in town. The local mafia however decides to muscle in and buy it. When Nash refuses the offer the mob blows up his joint which puts Pluto on the lam. As he sets out across the lunar landscape with his robot bodyguard Bruno (Randy Quaid) and his singer-hostess Dina (Rosario Dawson) Pluto looks to confront the head honcho who trashed his prize possession. Although some care obviously went into the look and design of the picture the script leaves a lot to be desired. In addition to the inanity of having the mobsters blow up Nashs club (when it was after all the possession they were after) screenwriter Neil Cuthbert ( Mystery Men) has provided little in the way of decent lines for the actors. For instance Quaid here suggests a cheerfully lobotomized Charles Foster Kane with his cueball head and blissed out peepers. But hes only given to endlessly calling out ""Boss"" to Eddie Murphy. Rosario Dawson turns out to be both pretty and pretty blank. Peter Boyle as Nashs best buddy looks as relaxed as a retired golfer on a pension in Florida. But he vanishes from the screen so quickly you forget he was even there. And that great black action star Pam Grier turns up as Nashs mother but the moviemakers quickly drop her like a hot potato. Only two performers manage to make something out of nothing. The first is Jay Mohr who plays the faux-Sinatra lounge singer Tony Francis. In a few quick scenes Mohr suggests a virtual finishing school of show-biz insincerity. The veteran character actor Luis Guzman as the happy smuggler Felix Laranga demonstrates that whether hes in a good movie ( Carlitos Way) or a bad one ( Magnolia) he has a magical way of connecting with an audience. Then theres the star Murphy. When he arrived on the scene in the early eighties with Saturday Night Live Murphy had the impact of a lightning bolt. If Richard Pryor had paved the way for black comedians to address what it meant to be black in white America Murphy turned that goal into his mission. But rather than dig deep into that anger Murphy developed a yuppie version of black rage. In the hit films 48 Hours Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop Murphys hostility was slick and calculating. He became a big star by playing the angry black man as a pose. Racism became merely a hot button to push pumping up his own popularity. That persona though grew pretty tired. Since then his career has been a struggle to regain his amazing skills for mimicry. Sometimes he has been successful (parts of The Nutty Professor Bowfinger) and many times not ( Life Holy Man). Now we get Murphy reduced to telling silly butt jokes while the movie makes him the butt of the joke. He plays a romantic hero but he doesnt have a single romantic or heroic moment in the picture. The Adventures of Pluto Nash may take place on the moon but the movie never gets off the ground.

Running time 90 minutes. Rated PG-13 (violence sexually suggestive language). At the E-Walk the Chelsea West the Union Square others. ------- THE Adventures of Pluto Nash"" - the Eddie Murphy outer-space comedy Warner Bros. has finally unleashed without advance critics screenings after two years on the shelf - is so unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines. It isnt even bad in a way that could be remotely construed as entertaining unless your idea of fun is counting lapses in continuity and scenes where the actors lip movements dont match the dialogue. Watching it is like watching 90 minutes of outtakes - deleted scenes randomly assembled by a drunken night watchman at the studio. The script attributed to Neil Cuthbert (""Mystery Man"") is beyond stupid - so underdeveloped it feels as if theyd shot the first draft by mistake. Not that theres anything that would justify doing a second. Murphy plays the title character a former smuggler who runs a popular nightclub on the moon in the year 2087 until the mob decides to muscle their way in. So much for the story. There are several dull badly directed chases and fight scenes (blame Ron Underwood who once helmed ""City Slickers"") cheesy special effects ugly sets - and mirthless matchups between Murphy and what seems like half the membership of the Screen Actors Guild. The A-list talent in this Z-grade flick includes Randy Quaid (as Plutos robot bodyguard) Joe Pantoliano Jay Mohr Luis Guzman James Rebhorn Peter Boyle Burt Young Miguez A. Nunez John Cleese - and even poor Pam Grier who is given absolutely nothing to work with as Plutos mother. Lets hope they werent paid in AOL Time Warner stock. With 90 million reportedly squandered on this dead-on-arrival fiasco this may be the worst news for the beleaguered conglomerates stockholders since the last earnings statement - even if ""Pluto Nash"" synergistically predicts America Online and CNN will still be in business 85 years from now. There is in fact exactly one funny scene - and it probably tells you everything you need to know that its a 30-second cameo by Alec Baldwin as a blustering gangster. This is a movie whose big joke - repeated several times like most of the other lame gags - is that Hillary Clintons face will adorn the 10000 bill in a few decades. The goateed Murphy who also plays a second role late in the proceedings occasionally mugs his way through with hysterical desperation. Mostly he seems mired in bored resignation as if he were waiting for someone to finish the script for ""Nutty Professor III."" He has no chemistry whatsoever with leading lady Rosario Dawson (of ""Men in Black II"" who deserves much better) as a singer who follows him around for reasons that seem to have been left on the cutting-room floor. Too bad they didnt leave this whole movie there - or didnt just ship what was salvaged to the remainder bin at Blockbuster. The ads for ""The Adventures of Pluto Nash"" rather desperately promise that ""In space everyone can hear you laugh."" If the opening day audience at the E-Walk yesterday is any indication that definitely wont be the case in movie theaters on Earth.
