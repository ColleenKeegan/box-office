"Boston.com / Aamp;E / Movies / Marci X doesnt know hip from hop Movies    Dining/Food    Local events    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Marci X doesnt know hip from hop By Wesley Morris Globe Staff 8/23/2003 In ""Marci X"" Marci Feld (Lisa Kudrow) takes over a rap label after the raunchy tunes of its biggest act provoke a senator to demand the head of the labels ailing CEO who happens to be Marcis dad. ADVERTISEMENT As the new label chief Marci embarks on a mission to make Dr. S (Damon Wayans) clean up his act. They wind up falling in love. Jaws drop all over Harlem and the Upper East Side and a firestorm of media speculation ignites over the blond Jewish American princess and the obscenely tattooed misogynist. She shops at Henri Bendel; he performs ""The Power in My Pants"" with a Roman candle exploding from his crotch.Richard Benjamin (who plays Marcis father) directed the movie from a screenplay by clever satirist Paul Rudnick and you can almost detect a jagged salvo on the hypocrisies of race sex class and hip-hop lurking beneath the lazy indifference. This could have been like Robert Downey Sr.s ""Putney Swope"" for Jewish girls; instead its exasperating in its enervated politically toothless jabs.I really wanted to be offended -- by its brilliance or by how boldly awful it could be. (I didnt care which.) But ""Marci X"" barely cares about itself. As the senator Christine Baranski is often unwatchable not because shes bad (which she is) but because theres usually makeup clumped on her face.Kudrow is game for the movies ironies at one point even donning an old Erykah Badu kente cloth head wrap and gown. But Wayans for his part provides only a shaky sense that he knows what hes doing. Permed and pimped-out Dr. S is trapped somewhere between one of Wayanss old ""In Living Color"" caricatures and Snoop Dogg resulting in a persona more laughable than threatening. And the hard-core hip-hop thats supposed to be an affront is simply a handful of old tunes from C+C Music Factory that somebody just put in the microwave.The movie has no idea what to make of black people or hip-hop culture; the script seems as if its been written by someone who spent one morning at the doctors office flipping through a copy of Vibe. Rudnick has better luck with vapid Jewish aristocrats which shouldnt be surprising since he spends a lot of time as one He writes a very funny movie column for Premiere magazine as ""Libby Gelman-Waxner."" But here he cant even bring off his assaults against J.Lo Suge Knight P. Diddy and N Sync with anything resembling conviction or aplomb.Rudnick also wrote the floundering ""In amp; Out"" and ""Isnt She Great"" and based on his insistence on half-hearted structuring he doesnt appear to take the craft of screenwriting seriously. In ""Marci X"" hes scribbled himself a gem that he has no interest in polishing.Maybe he knew what I suspected. Had this picture come out 10 years ago we might regard it today as we do other dated ""raptires"" such as ""CB4"" and ""Fear of a Black Hat"" with a sort of cockeyed fondness.""Marci X"" though is just clueless and sad seemingly having missed the point that hip-hop is no longer a novelty to be slapped on the cheek with a white glove. Although now that the music and its lifestyle have conquered the worlds teenagers I suppose the only frontier left is their grandmothers. Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

After all the point in both cases is the dancing. In ""The Medallion"" Mr. Chan proves yet again that he has the virtuosic grace -- and goofiness -- of any of the great clowns of the silent era and a complete refusal to abide by the laws of gravity. Do let us be clear however that the movies plot minus a few roundhouse kicks is straight out of the Scooby-Doo playbook. Mr. Chan is Eddie Yang a Hong Kong police inspector whos helping a cadre of Interpol agents slap the cuffs on Snakehead (Julian Sands) a nefarious international crime lord. Heading up the Interpol operation is the overzealous overweening Arthur Watson (Lee Evans) whos very eager to make clear just whos in charge here Mister. The agents trail their quarry to a Buddhist temple -- puzzling because Snakehead has never seemed to be a particularly religious man. But in this shrine is a small boy who holds great secrets. More to the point he holds a medallion that confers on its owner superhuman strength immortality and the power to annihilate. Eddie showing what sort of man he is objects to Watson bringing weapons into a temple. Watson showing what sort of man he is briskly objects to the objection. The scriptwriters showing the sort of people they are furnish the following dialogue ""Theyre holy guns. They make a big hole-y. Get it?"" No one gets what hes after in the temple. Interpol cant catch Snakehead. Thanks to Mr. Chans Eddie Snakehead snares neither the boy nor the medallion. He has better luck some days later in Hong Kong Harbor when he outwits the police and gets the boy and medallion on a slow boat from China. The story then shifts to Dublin where Eddie has been sent to aid Interpol -- hes the only one who knows what Snakehead looks like. There he hooks up once again with the officious Watson whos mad at Eddie for messing things up in Hong Kong and with old flame Nicole (Claire Forlani) whos mad at Eddie for not having called her in months. Suffice it to say that things really start to heat up in Ireland -- both with Eddie and Claire and with the search for Snakehead. In one heart-stopping chase sequence the prodigious Mr. Chan hurdles over a dozen bikes jumps onto a truck over a wall and over a chain-link fence to name just a few feats. Before the wrap-up the medallion and the little boy change hands several times guns are fired punches are traded and oh yes Eddie gets killed. Good thing hes got that medallion thing. Good thing for audiences too. Eddie back among the living now has superhuman strengths and capabilities (of course Mr. Chan has always seemed superhuman which makes for a great little inside joke). He can leap up and down tall buildings and through the air but hes so unaccustomed to these new powers that he cant yet correctly calibrate his bounces. Watching him here -- delightfully -- is like watching a golden retriever puppy that hasnt yet grown into its legs. Marci X Paramount Pictures chose not to hold critics screenings in advance of the opening of ""Marci X."" (Dimension a division of Miramax made the same decision about ""My Bosss Daughter"" reviewed below.) Now the only thing the companies need concern themselves with is word-of-mouth. In the dated wet-firecracker farce ""Marci X"" which might better have been called ""Marci Why"" Lisa Kudrow is Jewish-American princess Marci Feld a do-good if clueless socialite and the daughter of megamillionaire industrialist-philanthropist Ben Feld (Richard Benjamin who also directed). ""Isnt he handsome?"" Marci rhapsodizes about her father during a speech at a benefit dinner. ""And kosher."" Like Carrie Bradshaw of ""Sex and the City"" Marci is carefully blond absorbed in the minutiae of designer wear totters around Manhattan in stilettos and has a trio of similarly clad friends who fancy themselves sexual buccaneers but seem more than anything else like drag queens. Unfortunately things arent all Gucci-Pucci in Marcis world. Among Bens massive holdings is the record company Felony Assault whose top artist gangsta rapper Dr. S (Damon Wayans) has incited the high-minded fury of termagant senator Mary Ellen Spinkle (Christine Baranski). When Spinkle particularly outraged by Dr. S numbers like ""Six Grades Are Plenty"" and ""The Power in My Pants"" foments for a boycott against any and all Feld products Ben suffers a heart attack and Marci who like everyone else in the movie is more construct than character vows to resuscitate Daddys all-but-comatose company. Mr. Wayans provides a far more valuable service. As the hilariously foul-mouthed sweet-souled Dr. S he slaps ""Marci X"" to life every time hes on screen. But hes up against potent forces a desperately arch script by Paul Rudnick that perhaps could have worked as the basis for a high-camp Off-Broadway musical; Mr. Benjamins lumbering ham-handed direction; and Mr. Wayanss utter lack of chemistry with Ms. Kudrow who seems to wish she were elsewhere. An understandable feeling. My Bosss Daughter Moronic. idiotic. Insulting. Pathetic. But enough with the sweet talk. Lets move on to ""My Bosss Daughter"" which fairly begs for admittance into the witless protection program. Tom Stansfield (Ashton Kutcher) is a hapless milquetoast who toils away in the marketing department of a Chicago book-publishing company praying for two things that hell get to move over to the firms creative side (a laughable idea because Tom as embodied by Mr. Kutcher seems incapable of sentient thought creative or otherwise) and that hell get to put the moves on Lisa (Tara Reid) the lovely blond daughter of his boss Jack (Terence Stamp). Its typical of Toms luck that he thinks Lisa is inviting him on a date when in fact she thinks hes gay and is asking him to house sit at the antique-filled estate of the fiercesome Jack who insults employees with the same jaunty frequency that he fires them. Toms key task is tending to a pet owl but his attention is diverted when Jacks no-good son shows up followed by Jacks recently fired secretary and several of her friends to say nothing of a disgruntled drug dealer. Suffice it to say that the owl is responsible for the only hoots in a movie that attempts to find merriment in jokes about the mentally retarded the blind the deaf the disfigured and the wheelchair-bound. Lately the 25-year-old Mr. Kutcher has been the cynosure of tabloids and celebrity magazines thanks to his April-July romance with actress Demi Moore 40. A few more movies like ""My Bosss Daughter"" and hell have infinite leisure for his demanding social life.    DVD TIP If we can bury directors we can also praise them. Its useful to remember that ""Marci X"" director Richard Benjamin was also responsible for the winning ""My Favorite Year"" in which a hapless young writer on a 50s variety show is charged with baby-sitting the bibulous guest star (Peter OToole). Joe Morgenstern is on vacation.

Your Grade A A- B+ B B- C+ C C- D+ D D- F ? Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Yet another example of what happens when stereotypes collide Marci X offers a portrayal of the rap world that could only have come from a sixtysomething director best known for playing Philip Roth surrogates (Richard Benjamin) a Friends cast member (Lisa Kudrow) a fortysomething Wayans (Damon) and a screenwriter (Paul Rudnick) whose knowledge of rap seems derived entirely from a brief encounter with a C+C Music Factory video. Loosely inspired by Death Row Records and Ice Ts infamous bouts with moral watchdogs and the religious right Marci X casts Kudrow as a ditzy Jewish American Princess forced to take charge of a controversial gangsta-rap label after her father (Benjamin) becomes ill. Wayans plays the labels biggest star an incorrigible gangsta who for reasons known only to the filmmakers talks and dresses like a flamboyant queen. He seems to be going for Snoop Doggs effortless silkiness and pimp-couture fashion sense but he ends up closer to the effeminate cattiness of his own In Living Color gay film critic. Wayans whos old enough to play the father of the average rap star is woefully miscast as a charismatic thug but it seems unfair to single him out when theres so much blame to go around. Rudnick can be an extraordinarily clever writer but he doesnt seem to understand that a screenplay has to entail more than a series of skit ideas strung together. That Kudrow ""raps"" not once but twice indicates the dearth of imagination here as does the fact that Rudnick baldly (and badly) cannibalizes his own In amp; Out script for a sequence in which the films C. DeLores Tucker/William Bennett surrogate (Christine Baranski) reluctantly busts loose to one of Wayans concoctions. The makers of Bringing Down The House should thank the gods of cinema for Marci X which has relieved the Steve Martin/Queen Latifah hit of its status as the years most misguided culture-clash comedy.

Comments Marci X Satire that scores is apt to offend some people which may help to explain why this politically incorrect comedy was shelved by Paramount for a year then dumped into the market without press screenings. Scripted by the irreverent Paul Rudnick (Addams Family Values In amp; Out) its about a Jewish American Princess (Lisa Kudrow) teaming up with a controversial rap artist (Damon Wayans). Its no masterpiece but I found it consistently good-hearted and sometimes hilarious and the sparse crowd I saw it with was laughing as much as I was especially at the outrageous rap numbers. Richard Benjamin who plays a cameo as Kudrows philanthropic millionaire father directed. With Christine Baranski and Jane Krakowski. 84 min.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Aug. 25 2003 1212 PM JAP Rap In Marci X Lisa Kudrow plays a princess with a rap label. By David Edelstein Wayans and Kudrow in Marci X Lets wait and hope for better things Of all the fabulously rich wildly famous and beloved stars in our cultural firmament the one I feel the saddest about is Lisa Kudrow. In 200-plus episodes of Friends she has shown the world her perfect timing her physical aplomb and once in a blue moon her soulfulness. But most people regard her as a one-note virtuoso a Paganini of ditz. I feel lucky to have seen another side. I met Kudrow a couple of times in 1991 when she did a reading of a somewhat elephantine draft of a play Id written She made the dumb lines sound smart and the smart ones Wildean; I had a sense of not just her comic gifts but her complete commitment to her (iffy) material. She was also nice. Advertisement Its too bad she broke out so fast. She was marvelous in the L.A.-based improv group the Groundlings and if shed gone to Saturday Night Live she might have created a whole raft of comic types instead of getting stuck with airheads exclusively. Only two of her performances outside of Friends and Mad About You have excited me Her turn as the bitter ill-at-ease older sister in Don Roos The Opposite of Sex (1998) and her more athletic and exuberant ditz in Romy and Micheles High School Reunion (1997) in which she and Mira Sorvino had a delicious leggy accord. The word is that shes startlingly good--and different--as the drab disappointed wife of the porn star John Holmes (Val Kilmer) in the upcoming Wonderland. In the meantime we have the Kudrow vehicle Marci X which has been in the can for a year or two (at least) and has now been dumped into theaters with no screenings and no fanfare. I was first in line You never know. The premise is neat--that is both nifty and overly tidy A rich Jewish American princess (Kudrow) the daughter of a media mogul (Richard Benjamin who also directed) takes the reins of a rap label that her dad didnt know he owned until it became the target of a censorious senator (Christine Baranski). As she attempts to convince the labels potty-mouthed misogynistic star Dr. S (Damon Wayans)--whose songs include ""The Power in My Pants"" and ""It Aint My Baby Because I Dont Like You""--to repent on MTV she finds herself strangely attracted to this rap rapscallion. The screenwriter Paul Rudnick gives Kudrow some good bits in the first half of the film. Presenting a humanitarian award at an American Jewish Federation ceremony she surveys the moneyed crowd and says tenderly ""You Jews. You wonderful Jews. Who needs Santa Claus am I right?"" And when Marci is challenged to do a spontaneous rap before a hostile African-American audience Kudrow almost pulls off the number--about the power thats not in her pants but in her (groan) purse. If the context of Marci X were more realistic a lot of these gags would soar. But the context is drag-show dinner theater. Rudnick is a very very funny man; I loved the scene in which two of Marcis JAP friends lament the tragedy of the urban poor (""Can you imagine being addicted to heroin?"" ""Mmmm ... But does the weight stay off?""); and theres a riotous bad-taste bit at an auction to make money for kids who cant raise their arms. But Rudnick is too comfortable in his camp little universe When he writes broad comedy he makes it seem as if its beneath him to include real emotion; and his targets (the primly repressive Republican senator the duplicitous Latina sex bomb the effeminate N Sync-like quartet etc.) are fat and obvious. Rudnick is onto something wonderful when he riffs on the connection between nouveau-riche Jews and millionaire rappers The best moment in Marci X is when Marci regards Dr. S Siberian-chinchilla coat and says he reminds her of her Aunt Esther. But Marci doesnt grow or change as a character; as the movie drags on she gets duller and more passive. And Kudrow is horribly photographed with lighting that makes her skin look chalky and her nostrils cavernous. At least Kudrow wont get the blame for Marci X What really sinks the movie is Wayans. There must have been hundreds--thousands?--of African-American actors out there who could have brought an edge and some sexual threat to Dr. S. But Wayans plays the role with a high mincing singsong that might have worked for the Artist Formerly Known as Prince but doesnt begin to suggest the sullen macho insolence of most rappers. Hes girlier than his co-star. As for Kudrow her cinematic future looks brighter in darker roles. Next stop Wonderland. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Think of it as the campy cousin of a Christopher Guest parody. Assume its an occasionally lame occasionally barking-funny episode of ""South Park"" (including worthy songs cowritten by send-up genius Marc Shaiman) only its live action it stars Damon Wayans and Lisa Kudrow (in her shrewder-than-she-looks ""Analyze This"" mode) and it packs more opulent costume changes into 84 minutes than Ivana Trump managed in the entire 1980s. Im trying to get my head around Marci X a talent-stuffed assemblage of barbs and giddy musical numbers that shouldnt be written off as a feature flop - but savored instead for the cult-ready collection of late-night satirical skits and misses it is. Kudrow stars as Marci Feld couture-victim daughter of a Jewish business king played by Richard Benjamin (who also directs). Among Ben Felds holdings is the record label of Dr. S (Wayans) a rapper whose lyrics offend a moralizing U.S. senator (Christine Baranski). When the senator calls for a boycott and Feld collapses with a heart attack daughter Marci does damage control. Part of the problem with this lighter-than-""Bulworth"" commentary on class politics and art (written by agile parodist Paul Rudnick with eyebrow fully arched) is that for all its lighthearted gibes at rap posturing mogul vulgarity socialite vanity and black-white attitudinizing the movie feels disconnected from its own objects of ridicule. Rudnick whose more heartfelt play-turned-1995 movie ""Jeffrey"" featured Baranski in a ""Hoedown for AIDS"" at one point continues his disease-gala dissection in ""Marci X"" with a charity banquet for Children With No Feeling in Their Arms. I predict a robust rental future from the healthy who for no defensible reason laugh at the sight of youngsters solemnly being stuck with forks as a fund-raising ploy.

Pic may get a pass from critics because it isnt the unmitigated disaster that its negative buzz indicated. The term ""wildly uneven"" doesnt come close to charting the sporadic peaks and interminable valleys of ""Marci X"" a slapdash scattershot comedy about a pampered Jewish American Princess and her unlikely alliance with an aggressively controversial African-American rap star. Although it wasnt advance-screened for press pic may get a pass from many critics simply because it isnt the unmitigated disaster that its long-delayed release and deafening negative buzz indicated. Even so token theatrical run seems a mere formality for this trifle best suited for undiscriminating homevid renters. Shrewdly cast leads Lisa Kudrow and Damon Wayans give half-baked project far more than it ever gives them. Kudrow plays Marci Feld the fatuous sunny-bunny daughter of multimillionaire mogul Ben Feld (Richard Benjamin doing double duty as helmer). Marci excels in her avocations as charity fund-raiser society hostess and world-class shopaholic. But shes hard-pressed to be of much assistance when her father is blindsided by uproar over Dr. S (Wayans) a semi-incendiary rapper whose record label is one of Felds more obscure properties. Because of his tenuous connection to filthy music (that corrupts impressionable minds) Sen. Mary Ellen Spinkle (Christine Baranski in starchy snippy mode) an archconservative moralizer labels Feld a public menace -- and worse targets him for a Senate investigation. Severely stressed Feld winds up in a hospital isolation ward. So Marci takes it upon herself to confront Dr. S in the hope of convincing him to clean up his act. Not surprisingly Dr. S isnt eager to bowdlerize his chart-topping tunes. (Among his hit singles ""I Am the King of Your Mouth"" ""The Power in My Pants"" and ""It Aint My Baby Cause I Dont Even Like You."") And even after Marci improbably excites a Harlem concert audience with her own white-bread rap -- an improvised ode to designer handbags -- the preening gangsta refuses to cooperate with her campaign to rehabilitate his image. However Marci and Dr. S find themselves drawn toward each other. And with good reason The opposites are attractive. Kudrow hits the right balance of ditziness and sincerity while Wayans plays the good doctor with sly self-mocking wit. Better still they remain steadfastly in character even as their roles veer into caricature. Many mainstream pics are laughably timid when it comes to dealing with black-white star pairings. To its credit ""Marci X"" refuses to soft-pedal or avoid interracial sexual chemistry and matter-of-factly includes closeup liplocks and a frisky bedroom clinch. Screenwriter Paul Rudnick (""Jeffrey"" ""In amp; Out"") takes broad swipes at easy targets -- censorious right-wingers sexually ambiguous boy bands flighty JAPs gangsta poseurs etc. -- and occasionally hits paydirt with a few well-timed absurdities. (At one point Dr. S reluctantly admits that he and Marci have been cuddling while watching a lot of Meg Ryan movies together.) Supporting players -- including Billy Griffith as a Suge Knight-style record company executive -- are well attuned to pics cartoonishly satirical tone. For too much of its running time however ""Marci X plays like an overextended variety-show sketch. Inspiration flags in second half and Benjamins direction rarely evidences sufficient spark. Choppy continuity and erratic pacing underscore other problems. Pic has the patchworky feel of something that was reshaped in the editing room after previews then clumsily supplemented with last-minute reshoots. It doesnt help that lighting and lensing are so gracelessly unattractive. Amusing production numbers choreographed by stage vet Jerry Mitchell (""The Full Monty"") suggest ""Marci X"" may have been originally envisioned as a musical. Perhaps the pic will be remembered best as source material for a Broadway hit a few years down the road. Marci XProductionA Paramount Pictures release of a Scott Rudin production.

Starring Lisa Kudrow and Damon Wayans. Directed by Richard Benjamin. (R. 80 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Marci X"" a comedy starring Lisa Kudrow and Damon Wayans slipped into theaters on Friday hidden from critics -- but not alas from audiences. A culture-clash comedy about a Jewish heiress and a Harlem hip-hop artist its a dishonest satire that manages to be (disingenuously) contemptuous of white people and (unintentionally) condescending toward black people without ever being funny. The lack of laughs is a surprise considering the talent involved. In addition to Kudrow and Wayans theres funny character actress Veanne Cox wasted in an undistinguished role and Paul Rudnick (""In amp; Out"") wrote the screenplay. Yet theres nothing of Rudnicks incisive wit on display. ""Marci X"" plays like a satire made by people who dont know the worlds theyre satirizing. Kudrow plays Marci a Jewish American princess who dresses something like Reese Witherspoon in ""Legally Blonde"" even though shes from New York not Los Angeles and shes pushing 40. But then doesnt every wealthy New York woman in her late 30s dress that way? No. If theres a joke here its not quite connecting. One day a recording artist Dr. S (Wayans) releases an offensive CD on a label owned by Marcis father (director Richard Benjamin) that causes protests and a boycott of all of Dads vast media holdings. The CD is understood to be wholly without value with songs such as ""Shoot the Teacher"" and had the movie any truth in it Dad would not let his stock plummet over some pop act. Hed cut him loose as fast as he could pick up a cell phone. But no movies cant be five minutes long so Marci contacts Dr. S and tries to persuade him to participate in a public relations campaign. That begins her association with this humorless repellent character whom we first meet singing ""The Power in My Pants"" before an adoring uptown crowd. Soon hes humiliating Marci live onstage and she responds by singing -- just makes it up on the spot -- a rap called ""The Power in My Purse."" And the audience for some reason cheers her on. They think this rich white lady rapping about Gucci and Prada is great. By this point -- 15 minutes in -- the movie has already gone off a cliff and it has become clear why the studio needed to avoid critics. ""Marci X"" is a bomb -- not the bomb but a bomb -- false and tiresome with a fake buoyant energy. For the rest of its mercifully short running time the movie continues in this vein punctuated by witless musical numbers. To watch it is to feel sorry for the actors. ""When black people make love is it different?"" Marci asks Dr. S in whats supposed to be a tender moment. Its a cringe moment for the silliness of the question its unconscious condescension and its implicit and absurd self- effacement. Its a moment symptomatic of the movie as a whole The only thing egalitarian about ""Marci X"" is that its contemptuous of everybody. This film contains harsh language mild violence and sexual situations.

Running time 84 minutes. Rated R (profanity sex). At the E-Walk the New York Twin the Union Square others. MARCI X"" the lamest in the recent run of comedies about uptight white people getting jiggy with it would also be the most offensive - if it werent also the dullest. Lisa Kudrow plays Marci a Jewish-American Princess who knows only from shopping and organizing fund-raisers. When her corporate big shot father (Richard Benjamin who also directed) suffers a heart attack because one of his rap music labels is under attack by a senator (Christine Baranski) Marci decides to reform notorious hip-hop artist Dr. S (a lisping Damon Wayans in gangsta mode) whose hits include ""Shoot the Teacher"" and ""The Power Is in My Pants."" She wins over Dr. S and the sistahs with her own rap which goes something like this ""Im white Im blonde Im Jewish/ Can it get any worse?/But Ive got the power in my purse."" It gets worse Dr. S chinchilla coat ""reminds me of . . . my Aunt Esther"" Marci remarks before landing in jail and on the front page of The Post after a nightclub shooting. Jabs at Donald Trump Snoop Dogg Biggie Smalls Lizzie Grubman Sean Combs and Jennifer Lopez all fail to connect. Some very talented people were involved in this train wreck which Paramount opted to dump without advance press screenings. The guilty parties include Benjamin (who directed ""My Favorite Year"") screenwriter Paul Rudnick (""In and Out"") producer Scott Rudin (""The Hours"") and lyricist Marc Shaiman (""Hairspray""). For all their contributions ""Marci X"" gives ""Gigli"" a run for its money as the summers worst movie.
