(Exclusive) Rio Director Carlos Saldanha in Talks to Replace Joe Cornish on Foxs Rust (Exclusive) Insufferably inane movie assumes that youngsters think paleontology isnt cool -- and that the irritating performances by John Leguizamo and Justin Long will be funny Anyone who remembers Walt Disney Feature Animations 2000 film ""Dinosaur"" also likely remembers how directors Ralph Zondag and Eric Leighton squandered a promising idea by pairing breathtakingly lifelike imagery with embarrassingly phony dialogue. Despite trumping that film in 1999 and on the small screen even with the documentary miniseries ""Walking With Dinosaurs"" BBC Earth decided to follow in Disneys footsteps - including the missteps - with ""Walking With Dinosaurs 3D"" an insufferable family adventure whose impressive animation is consistently undercut by cartoonish self-awareness. Bookended by the contemporary story of a teenager named Ricky (Charlie Rowe) who thinks science is for losers the film stars John Leguizamo (""Kick-Ass 2"" the ""Ice Age"" series) as Alex a prehistoric parrot who tells the story behind a gorgosaurus tooth given to Ricky by his paleontologist uncle Zack (Karl Urban). Alex explains that the tooth was knocked out by Patchi (Justin Long) the runt of a litter of pachyrhinosauri who comes of age during his familys annual migration ritual. Also read Frozen The Croods The Wind Rises Top Oscar Slate of 19 Animated Films Struggling to assert himself beneath the dominant influence of his alpha-male brother Scowler (Skyler Stone) Patchi falls in love with a fellow pachyrhinosaurus named Juniper (Tiya Sircar) as he learns about the bigger challenges of the world around him. But when the herd is threatened by a gorgosaurus determined to turn their migration into a buffet Patchi is torn between staying loyal to his brother and exploring his own burgeoning leadership skills. The decision to use a framing device for this story is both crass and condescending suggesting that ""kids today"" couldnt possibly think paleontology is cool and then assuming that their version of what dinosaurs probably went through is awesome enough to sway even the most disaffected teenager. In spite of the kids ""too cool for fossils"" disposition Urban does his best to make the job look compelling but hes hopelessly outclassed by the dinosaurs who get about 20 times as much screen time as he does. Also read TheWrap Screening Series Epic Director Chris Wedge Calls Animated Filmmaking a 26.5-Mile Sprint As superfluous as that framing device is however it at least provides a respite from the dopey voice acting that Leguizamo and Long bring to these prehistoric characters. Spouting clunky dialogue about alpha males and laws of nature in between freeze-frame title cards announcing the species of each new dinosaur the ""name"" actors and their costars avoid anything resembling nuance or dimensionality even as writer John Collee (""Happy Feet"") confuses Darwinian principles with character loglines. As pathologically annoying as Leguizamo can be Long is by far the worst offender if only because his scrappy delivery is never ingratiating always irritating. But given conflicts that would feel cliched to kindergarteners the inevitability of a happy ending seems even more imminent than the extinction of dinosaurs and as a consequence theres no one for whom to root or about whom to care. (It definitely doesnt help that there are about five poop jokes within the first 15 minutes of the film either.)

Not for sale or duplication. Did dinosaurs feel love? Walking with Dinosaurs must argue yes as the genre of animal-centric edutainment has settled on hustling for respectability by propping up heterosexual norms. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Unfailingly these films go through lifes showiest moments as dutifully as encyclopedia entries birth courtship reproduction always from a male point of view. But the point of Walking with Dinosaurs is to look not to learn. And this new 3D spectacle is a visual miracle. The animation comes alive through a celebration of corporeality the jiggle of fat the stretch and release of sagging skin the tide-like motions of tendons and arteries beneath pebbled skin. Film Details Walking With Dinosaurs RatingPG GenreAnimation Running Time80 More Info Trailer And the dinosaurs themselves are crafted with love and creative extravagance. Set against live-action footage of Alaskan and New Zealand landscapes they barely stand out as the products of ones and zeroes. And the species at the films core are outfitted with horned headdresses so outlandishly rococo they would make Louis XIV weep with jealousy. If only they didnt speak or had anyone speak for them. Virtually every breath of these wonderful lizard gods is overexplained by a logorrheic narrator (John Leguizamo) a time-traveling bird who sounds like hes studying for the SATs (""prehistoric pugilism"" ""mayhem in the ranks""). The awkwardly sophisticated avian patter jars with the barely there romance between two pachyrhinosauri. The only solace from the uninspired characters and crammed-in factoids are the gags about poop and puke -- juvenile yes but also appropriate for the films ""back to nature"" ethos.

Go to a dinosaur exhibit sometime -- it could be one of those animatronic ones or just a regular old fossil display -- and as you stand there marveling at the creatures ask yourself two questions (1) Can you believe such things existed? and (2) Do you think poop jokes would make the experience more compelling? Youd think itd be hard to screw up a movie about dinosaurs and yet Hollywood keeps doing so. Walking With Dinosaurs 3D an attempt to create a kid-friendly movie tied to the famous 2000 BBC TV series is but the latest offender. The problem is clear from the very beginning with its framing device of two young kids who are out on a trip with their paleontologist uncle (Karl Urban). The boy is bored -- because theres nothing that bores young kids as much as you know dinosaurs -- even after theyre presented with a real gorgosaurus tooth. The tikes interest piques however when hes approached by a wisecracking crow (voiced by John Leguizamo) who then morphs into a prehistoric parrot and begins narrating a tale about a submissive young runt pachyrhinosaurus named Patchi (voiced by Justin Long). We first meet Patchi when hes struggling to join in on eating his moms vomit with his brothers and sisters. In the next scene a larger dinosaur shits on him. Are you starting to get the picture? Eventually Patchi finds himself in a bit of a rivalry with his more dominant brother Scowler (Skyler Stone). He also falls in love with fellow pachyrhinosaurus Juniper (Tiya Sircar). Its a humdrum and lifeless plot with occasional pit stops into scatological humor. One marvels at the thinking that assumes young kids the same ones who can spend hours talking about and playing with dinosaurs would need a bunch of dumb gross gags and boilerplate dramatics in order to pay attention to freaking dinosaurs. But sometimes I wonder if it isnt the adults -- as in the filmmakers and executives -- who are trying to keep themselves interested by adding wisecracking crows and whatnot to these stories. Its frustrating because the CG animation in the film is quite excellent with its vast herds of photorealistic creatures migrating across strikingly beautiful real-life landscapes. (""Its a future oil field so dont get too attached"" cracks the parrot at the sight of one of these gorgeous lakes in what must be the films sole halfway decent line.) The quality of the imagery actually adds to the incongruence of the voices and the plot. Not just because one seems to have been done with care and the other with slapdash abandon but also because the dialogue doesnt quite sound right coming out of these creatures. Cartoonish beasties are one thing but these guys are ""realistic"" (to the extent that animated dinosaurs can in any way be realistic) and its hard to look at their beaklike mouths and hear human sounds like say Justin Longs voice coming out of them. It adds an extra layer of amateurishness to the proceedings. Still theres enough technical competence to the imagery itself that it might be possible to enjoy Walking With Dinosaurs if you waited for it to come out on DVD cut out the framing device and turned the sound off. But heres a better idea Just go get the original BBC Walking With Dinosaurs instead.

Rated PG (mild peril and rude humor). At the Kips Bay Orpheum Harlem USA others. Prehistoric creatures migrate south migrate back north and migrate back south again to mind-numbing effect in this BBC Nature co-production which features photo-realistic 3-D animation against beautiful Alaskan backgrounds. What passes for a story in this sub-""Ice Age effort pits underdog dinosaur Patchi (voiced by Justin Long) against older brother Scowler (Skyler Stone) for leadership of the pack. You could write ""Walking With Dinosaurs off as harmless filler for the under-5 set except that the only female dinosaur Juniper (Tiya Sircar) exists solely to moon over Patchi who as a hatchling lost part of an ear to a winged predator. ""She loves me and my hole exults Patchi who has a lot of groan-worthy lines straight out of a Jurassic-era jokebook -- but nowhere near as many as poor John Leguizamo who hopefully got well-paid to voice a stereotypical Latino bird providing a stream of nonsensical narration.

Where was screenwriter John Collee when Terrence Malick was directing his inscrutable digital-dino scenes in ""The Tree of Life""? For better or worse in ""Walking With Dinosaurs"" theres never any doubt what the big lizards are thinking courtesy of wall-to-wall chatter penned by Collee and performed by the likes of Justin Long and John Leguizamo. The constant reptile repartee marks a major departure from the propertys earlier incarnation as a BBC nature series which held kids transfixed as a distinguished British narrator described the actions of silent CG dinosaurs. Aiming for broader appeal as a Fox wide release this comedic 3D update from directors Barry Cook (""Mulan"") and Neil Nightingale might more aptly be called ""Wisecracking With Dinosaurs."" In direct acknowledgement of the challenges grownups face in getting kids to care about learning -- even when the most fearsome creatures ever to have walked the earth are involved -- the film opens with a sullen teen (Charlie Rowe) glued to his iPhone as his uncle (Karl Urban looking more like a country-western singer than a paleontologist) tries to spark his interest in a remote dinosaur dig. Enter Alex (voiced by Leguizamo) a cocky raven who channels one of his ancestors -- a red-and-black Late Cretaceous bird called an Alexornis -- and begins rattling off what ""Jurassic Park"" referred to as ""an adventure 65 million years in the making."" Whereas the BBC series gave screen time to some of the worlds most popular dinosaurs this feature follow-up opts to focus on several more obscure species. The main character is a runty horn-headed Pachyrhinosaurus whom the film treats less like a dino than an oversized dog -- or more accurately an underdog. Nearly devoured in his nest Patchi (Long) gets by with a hole in the bony frill that surrounds his head supplying a nice perch for our increasingly obnoxious narrator Alex. Over the course of the next 80-odd minutes -- which for conveniences sake compress a decade or more of growth into a single cross-country trek -- Patchi blooms into a massive veggie-eating monster. Thanks to Longs playful voice and endearing character work audiences will cheer for this big ugly brute as he falls in love with lady dino Juniper (Tiya Sircar) butts heads with big brother Scowler (Skyler Stone) and defends the herd from a Gorgosaurus attack (like a T. Rex but with even tinier claws). Visually ""Walking With Dinosaurs"" dazzles with its combination of Animal Logic-animated CG creatures (who sometimes rear their heads off the screen) and beautiful practical backgrounds (mostly shot against real Alaska and New Zealand landscapes). The hybrid technique recalls Disneys 2000 ""Dinosaur"" as do certain elements of the plot which relies on a road-trip scenario to mobilize the action. (The ""Ice Age"" series uses the same trick finding excuses to set its characters in motion with each film.) Less dazzling is the constant stream of jokey banter which thwarts the pics educational potential and caps its target age awfully low. Basically viewers must be young enough to appreciate prehistoric poop jokes before the experience starts to grate. And while Collees writing is both cleverer and less condescending than the studio-produced equivalent (the dino-delivered line ""Some day these mammals will go extinct and well have the last laugh"" deserves a chuckle) it appears to be in direct contradiction to the animation style. As in the BBC series the dinosaurs are meant to look realistic with few attempts to anthropomorphize them whereas the dialogue makes them into cartoons. Collee piles on references to such distinctly human concepts as ninjas and ballet while 21st-century expressions (""Worst migration ever"") and a forgettable selection of pop tunes feel instantly biodegradable. Clearly the intention is to draw modern audiences into the prehistoric experience but such concessions date the experience instead.

The bottom line is 3 families walked out on the movie I nearly fell asleep and my 7 year old daughter was bored and kept asking me what time it was. If I would have spent a 1.50 for the rental I would have all felt like I wasted my money. Save yourself the pain unless you need a nap..... Just sit at home and watch an hour and half of commercials. The entertainment would be equal to that of the movie. Reply LOL says December 20 2013 at 1059 am This is what happens when Americans get hold of an earnest British educational programme designed to enhance the factual understanding of children they turn it into crap. No wonder American kids are leagues behind the rest of the world in education. You are not helping yourselves.

Credit 20th Century Fox ""The Lion King"" goes prehistoric in ""Walking With Dinosaurs"" a good-looking extension of the franchise that began as a BBC television series.This family-friendly film combines computer-generated dinosaurs and real settings to tell a story of a herd on the move struggling to survive and facing a leadership change complicated by budding romance. In other words not unlike the struggle/change/romance story of ""The Lion King."" Theres even a bird acting as a sort of guide and troubleshooter.John Leguizamo provides the voice of the bird Alex and pairs nicely with Justin Long who is the voice of Patchi the tales main character. Patchi is a pachyrhinosaurus who starts out as the runt of the litter but is destined for big things. He has a crush on a female named Juniper (Tiya Sircar) and their slowly blossoming romance is essentially a reworking of the one between Simba and Nala those animated lions.Patchi also clashes with his brother Scowler (Skyler Stone) and everything builds to a decisive moment of courage. The movie looks great the writing is peppered with moments of wit and theres even an educational component built in as dinosaur facts are displayed on the screen. But be warned There are genuinely frightening moments because for a new leader of the pack to be needed something bad has to happen to the old leader of the pack.""Walking With Dinosaurs"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for vivid scary moments of fire and death.

The main character starts off a young dino who grows up to fill his fathers shoes as leader of his herd. Claudia Puig USA TODAY 603 p.m. EST December 19 2013The talking doesnt live up to the walking through realistic 3-D backgrounds.Patchi the Pachyrhinosaurus (voiced by Justin Long) as an adult in Walking With Dinosaurs.(Photo Twentieth Century Fox)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review   out of fourStars Justin Long John Leguizamo Charlie Rowe Karl Urban Angourie RiceRated PG; Runtime 1 hour 27 minutes; Opens Friday nationwideWalking With Dinosaurs 3-D is the movie for anyone who has dreamed of watching young dinos in love.For the rest of us this narrative blend of Jurassic Park Disneys computer-animated Dinosaur and The Land Before Time just feels familiar (  out of four; rated PG; opens Friday nationwide). The lead character is a misunderstood jokey adolescent dinosaur who seems a lot like the turkey from Free Birds or the snail from Turbo with some resemblance in character to the teenage Simba from The Lion King.Its a meandering tale of realistic-looking computer-generated beings inhabiting 3-D live-action backgrounds that capitalizes on childrens fascination with the beasts. The photo-realistic look is striking but the dialogue is occasionally wince-inducing. Think a sub-par Flintstones episode.SNEAK PEEK Walking with DinosaursREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersA Pachyrhinosaurus named Patchi (voiced by Justin Long) is a brave and insatiably curious young herbivore who gets separated from his herd in what is now Alaska. Patchi strikes up a friendship and then sparks with Juniper (Tiya Sircar) an adventurous female Pachyrhinosaurus from another herd. The pair are accompanied on a journey by Scowler (Skyler Stone) Patchis big and occasionally bullying brother who also makes a power play for Junipers sizable paw.The film offers some educational points about types of dinosaurs that traveled a less-beaten path than the usual Hollywood fare of T. rexes and Stegosaurs. It introduces a predatory Gorgosaurus along with several other breeds and delineates whether they are carnivorous or herbivorous. It also informs viewers about the modern-day descendants of dinosaurs birds.Still the tale of dinosaurs in a love triangle may be pushing the limits of anthropomorphism.Thats preferable to the excess of jokes involving excrement and vomit. Its as if makers of childrens films think thats the only way to grab their attention. Give kids a bit more credit.Though Walking is billed as ""the first time in movie history (that) audiences will truly see and feel what it was like when dinosaurs ruled the Earth"" the visuals are undercut by the retro story and unfunny dialogue.One of the few non-dinos in the mix is Alex a colorful Alexornis bird sporting a Spanish accent (his origins are in Mexico). Voiced by John Leguizamo Alex serves as a narrator.A live-action framing device involving an adolescent boy on vacation with his sister and paleontologist uncle (Karl Urban) is awkwardly brief and hardly worth noting. It does however introduce Alex who thrusts the action 70 million years into the Cretaceous period.The immersive landscape is stunning and the pedigree behind the film is impressive. Co-screenwriter John Collee wrote the charming Happy Feet and co-director Barry Cook was one of the directors on the winsome Arthur Christmas. His directing partner Neil Nightingale has produced some stunning nature documentaries. Perhaps as a nod to documentary verisimilitude none of the animals mouths move. They may flirt and crack wise but their mouths remain firmly shut.Given the impressive special effects in this kid-friendly version of the BBC series of the same name these dinosaurs successfully walk the walk. If only they had done a lot less talking. 8 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/JMOfJSHoliday Movie Calendar DecemberTake a look at the films heading to the box office this December complete with trailers reviews previews and more.

A lonely writer (Joaquin Phoenix) develops an unlikely relationship with his new operating system (Scarlett Johansson) thats designed to meet his every need. Also starring Amy Adams. (Photo Warner Bros.) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Updated Dec. 19 2013 217 p.m. ET One of the first signs of a new era having arrived was the Tamagotchi a handheld virtual pet that aroused tender feelings in its owners. Now in a blissfully inventive fantasy called ""Her"" Spike Jonze offers a vision of our eras evolution. Its the story of Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix) a lonely guy who falls in love with his smartphones operating system. Not just any OS you understand and certainly not a system with the emotional limitations of Apples Siri. This OS marketed by a software company in the near future is highly intelligent eager to learn eerily intuitive ardent when aroused and able to speak for herself--her name is Samantha--in the lovely voice of Scarlett Johansson. She doesnt have a body but in the deathless words of ""Some Like It Hot"" nobodys perfect. WSJ film critic Joe Morgenstern reviews Her which he calls a blissfully inventive fantasy of a film. Photo Warner Bros. Mr. Jonze approaches perfection in the department of deadpan humor. In other hands his premise could have been a clever gimmick and little more. But he draws us into Theodores world then develops it brilliantly by playing everything scrupulously straight. Theres no big drama when Theodores new OS comes up for the first time and Samantha says almost casually ""Hello Im here""--great romances dont always begin with thunderclaps or violins. Hes surprised but intrigued so they chat; voice recognition has made keyboards obsolete. His surprise grows into quiet astonishment at how good she is at getting a sense of who he is and what he needs. In a matter of nanoseconds she scans the thousands of emails in his inbox--a few make her laugh--and decides that 86 are worth saving ""We can delete the rest"" she says. He agrees casually and just like that a new normal has been established for them and for us. ""Her"" is hugely appealing for a variety of reasons not all of them obvious. For one thing it builds on what we already know about ourselves--at least those of us whove become willing symbiotes to mobile devices. Were already well disposed toward our smartphones; some academic studies of such relationships have reported emotions verging on love. For another it addresses a question hitherto unasked Can one have good phone sex with a phone? All of the performances are impeccable both in their comic timing and their unforced humanity. The latter quality is expressed not only by Mr. Phoenix and Amy Adams who is quietly exquisite as Theodores filmmaker friend--she makes Warhol-like documentaries--but by Ms. Johansson whose voice conveys a wider range of feelings than anyone elses. (Mr. Jonze made eloquent use of James Gandolfinis voice in his 2009 screen version of Maurice Sendaks ""Where the Wild Things Are"" a fantasy that failed to get the respect it deserved.) The film also builds on everyday sights Hoyte Van Hoytema did the extraordinary cinematography. All over the world these days people wander earbuds in ears oblivious to the life around them in trancelike communion with their phones. Its fairly near-fetched to think of the phones themselves becoming sole companions. And since were social creatures as well as gadget slaves we can readily understand the pleasure Theodore takes from sharing his surroundings with Samantha by keeping his phone in a front pocket camera lens facing forward wherever he goes. One sequence falls flat. It concerns an attempt at a corrective to Samanthas disembodiment but the pacing is off and the staging is clumsy as if Mr. Jonze knew hed gone briefly wrong but couldnt bring himself to scrap the whole notion. For the most part however things go remarkably right. Olivia Wilde figures vividly in one of Theodores encounters with flesh-and-blood women. Samanthas program allows for upgrades and when she gets one--who among us wouldnt welcome being upgraded?--her relationship with the man shed been dedicated to serve grows ambiguous. ""Im yours and Im not yours"" she admits. In other words the kind of quantum-state love thats all too common in affairs of the heart. What gives the film a significant upgrade is Mr. Jonzes gift for understated poetry with intimations of philosophy. Lyrical flashbacks illuminate the love its hero once had and lost. (Rooney Mara is his ex-girlfriend.) Samantha brings him out of himself but she grows too so startlingly as to suggest a benign version of Skynet the self-aware computer network of the ""Terminator"" films; she leaves us feeling tenderness toward our limited but sensitive species. ""The hearts not like a box that gets filled up"" she tells Theodore. ""It expands in size the more you love."" This beautiful film conjures with feelings wondering all the while whether you need to be human to have them. Watch a clip from the film ""The Past."" An Iranian man deserts his French wife and children to return to his homeland. His wife starts up a new relationship a reality her husband confronts upon his wifes request for a divorce. (Photo/Video Sony) The Past The recent past of Asghar Farhadis career is illustrious. The Iranian filmmaker won a richly deserved Oscar in 2012 for ""A Separation"" a drama set in Iran that begins with a domestic dispute becomes a mystery of imponderable motives and extends to concentric separations and fissures that define an entire society. His new film set in France is less complex though not much so; the layers have layers in Mr. Farhadis narratives. The title itself is layered with irony; the past is never past but always shaping the present. ""The Past"" plays out within narrower bounds than ""A Separation"" and often at lower velocity--a few moments feel almost Chekhovian. Yet the film is commanding in its own right another exploration of a volatile situation--an estranged husband returning from Iran when his wife requests a divorce--in which flashes of insight or understanding lead to new mysteries. ENLARGE Tahar Rahim and Berenice Bejo in The Past Sony Pictures Classics The husband Ahmad is played by Ali Mosaffa. Like everyone else in the cast Mr. Mosaffa is a fascinating presence and a stern one at first; Ahmad doesnt want a divorce and hes appalled by the emotional chaos in which his wife Marie (Berenice Bejo) has plunged herself and her two daughters. Unbeknownst to Ahmad Marie has a boyfriend Samir (Tahar Rahim) whose own life is in deep disorder. The central mystery of the film turns on what has happened to Samirs wife and who bears the responsibility for it. Im being vague to avoid giving too much away but ""The Past"" isnt vague at all and thats a remarkable accomplishment since at least three of its characters--Samir Marie and her daughter Lucie (Pauline Burlet)--are either strangers to their own motives or operating on false assumptions as they lurch along in search of liberating truth. And theres another dimension to the film one that may help explain how Mr. Farhadi has been able to operate so successfully in a country where other filmmakers have been beset by suffocating censorship or barred from making films and imprisoned. ""The Past"" can be read as the story of a Muslim husband certainly flawed but a man of calm rectitude who restores order and decency to the life of a misguided French woman in a morally reprehensible society. ""You were not made for this place"" an Iranian cafe-owner friend tells Ahmad. Thats not to diminish ""The Past"" only to add one more layer to its depth. Watch a clip from the film ""Walking With Dinosaurs"" a story where an underdog dino triumphs to become a hero for the ages. (Photo/Video 20th Century Fox) Walking With Dinosaurs 3D Its unlikely that a dinosaur wrote the script--the Writers Guild of America makes no provision for Cambrian membership--but this animated feature is dimwitted all the same. The title should be ""Trudging With Dinosaurs"" (in 2.5-D for all the grandeur the glasses confer) because the only semblance of a plot is provided by a long migration to winter grounds. The dinos trudge one way for a while occasionally butting heads; then they go the other way to fill out the films trudging time. Its like ""Babe"" without brains. ""I hate headbutting"" says the young hero Patchi ""its so prehistoric."" But the whole production is prehistoric a shoddy culmination of the TV series in which the migration is accompanied by a full orchestra with a percussion section that bangs away as if the dinos were trudging to war. Another form of headbutting. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download ENLARGE Lars and the Real Girl (2007) Instead of the inamorata being an operating system its a life-size sex doll beloved of Lars Lindstrom (Ryan Gosling in a one-of-a-kind performance) a likable but withdrawn young man who has bought the doll on the Internet then endowed his silicone beauty with a personality. The residents of the small Midwestern town where Lars lives go along with him because they realize hes not a hopeless nut job but a good soul in distress. Of all the unfashionable things in our crass day and age this is a movie about kindness. ENLARGE The Artist (2011) Berenice Bejo is enchanting as an extra Peppy Miller in this mostly silent entirely black-and-white and superbly stylish comedy which is set in Hollywood and starts in 1927 when audiences were still enraptured by the soundless sight of Hollywood stars on the silver screen. The movies fictional star George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is a charming peacock-vain amalgam of Douglas Fairbanks and John Gilbert with a canine companion who does clever pooch tricks. Ms. Bejos Peppy comes to Georges attention by sheer accident or maybe equally sheer ambition. ENLARGE Bringing Up Baby (1938) A dinosaur and a dinosaur bone are central to the plot of this peerless farce which also involves two leopards--the nice ones name is Baby--and a dog that likes to dig as well as Cary Grant (never funnier) and Katharine Hepburn (never more enchanting). Hes a paleontologist seeking a grant from a wealthy donor. Shes the donors niece and the prospective heiress to her fortune. Howard Hawks directed at a breakneck pace from a script by Dudley Nichols and Hagar Wilde. The cast includes Charlie Ruggles May Robson and Barry Fitzgerald. Corrections amp; Amplifications In the Bringing Up Baby synopsis an earlier version of this article incorrectly implied that Katharine Hepburns character was an heiress to her uncles fortune. The fortune belonged to her characters aunt. 45 Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Patchi (voiced by Justin Long) left is much smaller than his brother Scowler (Skyler Stone) in ""Walking With Dinosaurs 3D."" ( 20th Century Fox) By Stephanie Merry December 19 2013 Follow stephmerry Like an elaborately decorated wedding cake the kid-friendly ""Walking With Dinosaurs 3D"" may leave you wondering how something so stunning could end up being so bland. Aesthetic attention to detail even when its painstaking goes only so far when the content is mediocre. The movie begins with a fleeting modern-day framing device about an archaeologist (Karl Urban) on a dig with his niece and nephew and then goes back to prehistoric times to follow a young pachyrhinosaurus Patchi (voiced by Justin Long) and his best friend and co-narrator a colorful bird named Alex (John Leguizamo). Patchi is the runt among his siblings and a run-in with a larger dino leaves him with a distinctive hole in the frill projecting above his head. And yet this underdog has plenty of spirit and more smarts than his burlier brethren. The movie aims to show the harshness of the dinosaur-eat-dinosaur world and it doesnt shy from killing off parental figures Disney style. Yet a bit of comedy and a little love (Patchi falls for Juniper a pachyrhinosaurus from another herd) softens the reality. Nevertheless the plot feels haphazard and repetitive with frequent scenes depicting the dangers as the herd travels north and south depending on the season. And curiously as new characters appear the action pauses while a childs voice states the type of dinosaur the meaning of its name and whether its a carnivore omnivore or herbivore. This might help the audience understand whether that creature will be a danger to Patchi but the information could have been conveyed within the plot. Such is one of the problems with the adventure which is based on a documentary television series of the same name (minus the 3-D). ""Walking With Dinosaurs 3D"" seems to have an identity crisis. Does it want to be edutainment or a feature film? Its reported 85 million budget lands it closer to a blockbuster than to ""The Voyage of the Mimi"" but it doesnt feel adequate in either category. An interview with Barry Cook who directed the movie with Neil Nightingale sheds some light on the varied tones. At first ""Walking With Dinosaurs"" wasnt going to have dialogue; viewers could figure out the story for themselves. The voices were added later and its obvious. The characters who speak English which is a small group appear to be communicating telepathically talking to each other without moving their mouths. Its oddly distracting and with one very funny exception the banter doesnt go much beyond scatological humor and banal exchanges. Its interesting to consider what the movie would have been like without the voices. The images are impressive and intense. The movies scenery was shot in New Zealand and Alaska and the backdrops make an ideal canvas for the computer-generated creatures. The migrating herds look amazingly naturalistic. Of course the vocals help keep the little ones interested and open up the movies potential appeal beyond museum screens. It just seems that any film with so much talent poured into its visuals could have assembled an equally worthy script.  1/2 PG. At area theaters. Contains creature action and peril and mild rude humor. 80 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Walking With Dinosaurs is fine but talking is the trouble By Joe Williams joewilliamspost-dispatch.com 314-340-8344 Joe Williams Dec 19 2013 (...) Jody Mitori Patchi (left) in ""Walking With Dinosaurs."" In the Stone Age of animation -- the 20th century -- audiences would have considered a computer-generated toon like ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" a marvel. And the 3-D enhancements would have blown their little minds. But apparently millennial kids demand something more than mere realism. They demand dinosaurs that can talk.That was the rationale that adapted the BBCs original ""Walking With Dinosaurs"" documentary into this strange hybrid of science lesson and Saturday-morning cartoon.Interestingly the characters mouths dont move so without the sound this could be a valuable educational asset; with the sound its an irritant that could quell kids interest in biology like an ice age. The narrative thats yoked to the visuals is a standard cycle-of-life story (albeit with the yucky reproduction and death scenes discreetly pushed to the side).An annoying narrator bird (voice of John Leguizamo for shame) tells us the setting is 70 million years ago. Thats when a young pachyrhinosaurus (think triceratops) named Patchi (Justin Long) hatches from an egg. Patchi is a runt and his close encounter with a predatory gorgosaurus (think T. Rex) leaves him with a hole in his head plate. In a variation on ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" Juniper (Tiya Sircar) thinks the hole makes him cute. It also lets us identify Patchi in the many herd scenes that follow. Every autumn the dinosaurs migrate south and every spring they return north. Along the way there are struggles for herd leadership (with Patchis older bother asserting his dominance) and mate selection (ditto) but the realistic dinosaur animations seamlessly superimposed on backgrounds from New Zealand are not too scary for grade-school kids. Indeed the kids might laugh so hard at the fart jokes that they miss the evolutionary lessons.In ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" the good intentions are fossilized under the cutesy poop.What ""Walking With Dinosaurs""  Two and a half stars out of four  Rating PG  Run time 127  Content Creature action and peril and mild rude humor Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

"Walking with Dinosaurs talking dinos deserve extinction review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesWalking with Dinosaurs talking dinos deserve extinction reviewWalking with Dinosaurs 3D features talking computer-generated dinosaurs.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Dec. 19 2013Walking with Dinosaurs 3DStarring the voices of Justin Long John Leguizamo Skyler Stone Tiya Sircar. Directed by Neil Nightingale and Barry Cook. Opens Dec. 20 at major theatres. GBack when dinosaurs ruled the Earth -- and talked about it -- there was a cheerful baby Pachyrhinosaurus named Patchi who had a hole in the leathery fringe on top of his head a bullying big brother and a desire to make his mark in the prehistoric world.Beyond computer-generated recreations of dinos banish any thoughts that feature film Walking With Dinosaurs 3D has much in common with its origins the 1999 BBC series Walking With Dinosaurs. This is more The Lion King-meets-Happy Days in the Late Cretaceous Period.Article Continued BelowThe marketing bumph for the film trumpets that ""for the first time in movie history audiences will truly see and feel what it was like when dinosaurs ruled the Earth.""Only if they talked like mall rats spouting lines penned by lousy standup comics like ""sweet pond scum"" while dealing with being pooped on and debating the merits of barfed-up meals. The favourite word in this age (if you believe dinosaurs did indeed talk) appears to be ""butt.""Walking With Dinosaurs 3D is about as dumbed-down as nature cinema can get (at least their lips dont move) made even worse by stereotyped male-female roles that really do hearken back to the Stone Age.Real Alaskan backdrops are used to create a natural environment and occasionally the CGI dinosaurs stand out like parts of a cheap diorama. The computer animation is generally impressive in detail and scope yet the ridiculous story used to put frills and chills into the mix is disappointing.The plot is simple enough Alexomis bird Alex (John Leguizamo leaning heavily on a Latin accent) narrates telling the tale of his best pal Patchi. Hes the runt of the Pachyrhinosaurus litter who lives with his mom (named ""Patchis mom"") herd leader dad Bulldust (he cant talk; he only bellows) and super-competitive jock older brother Scowler (Skyler Stone).The clan heads south for the winter but not before Patchi (voiced by Alvin and the Chipmunks Justin Long) falls for Juniper (Tiya Sircar) the prettiest Pachyrhinosaurus around. Misfortunes and misadventures of the carnivorous variety change dynamics with each new dinosaur species introduced into the film via a child narrator by Latin name and English translation. That sums up the science part.Edmontosaurus the co-star of 2011s March of the Dinosaurs drops some CanCon while scampering possum-like Alphadons take the meerkat roles.Directors Barry Cook (Arthur Christmas) and Neil Nightingale (producer of wildlife films including Meerkats The Movie) and writer John Collee (Happy Feet Master and Commander The Far Side of the World) have done far superior work so their poor delivery here is puzzling.Little viewers will enjoy the saucy banter and onscreen frolicking and parents wont have to shield small eyes from bloodless scenes that explain the survival of the fittest. What they are going to have to explain is that dinosaurs didnt refer to their world as ""awesome""The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Directors Neil Nightingale Barry Cook. PG Mild peril. Area theaters. Kids love dinosaurs. But only the littlest kids will love ""Walking with Dinosaurs."" Even then parents of tiny moviegoers should be aware that this well-meaning but dull prehistoric adventure will require explanations as to why we can ""hear"" the dinos speak when we never see their mouths move. (Its not telepathy just lazy filmmaking.) Yes the films CG dinos look great tromping in the Alaskan wilderness but children deserve better than such unchallenging fare. A plot summary is unnecessary but here are the basics. Its 70 million years ago and Patchi the Pachyrhinosaurus (voiced irritatingly by Justin Long) seeks food a mate and survival. There are poop and puke jokes -- further evidence that this adaptation of a BBC documentary series has no creativity. Disneys underappreciated ""Dinosaur"" in 2000 was much better -- no bones about it.

Comments click to enlarge Walking With Dinosaurs Video Rated PG  87 minutes  2013 BBC Earth Films produced this computer-animated feature an expansion of its 1999 TV series. More educational than your average big-screen family entertainment it provides a lesson in prehistoric geography and the behavior of dinosaurs from the Cretaceous period. Unfortunately the filmmakers must have been worried that the science lesson though perfectly engaging on a visual level would bore small children so the movie is stuffed with glib unfunny wisecracks along the lines of Shrek.

And even though its not really ""of"" the holiday season in any other manner than in the nakedly commercial sense its still a movie that should appear on your ""to-do"" radar if youre the proud mom or dad to a youngin. Yes indeed ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" features of a fair amount of educational content clever and photorealistic dinosaur CGI and John Leguizamo voicing a prehistoric bird. What else would one need for a fun movie stew? Now then what can you expect out of ""Walking with Dinosaurs""? Cartoon dinosaurs trying to eat other cartoon dinosaurs. But thats not necessarily a bad thing and its handled with dare I say a certain scientific elegance. Each time a new dinosaur appears a graphic pops up with the name notes if the dinosaur is an omnivore carnivore or herbivore and then - for good measure - throws in the etymology of the dino name. Which means children will actually be learning a bit while consuming their entertainment. To delve into plot the genesis of ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" is rather awkward even for a PG childrens film. Uncle Zack (Karl Urban) is a paleontologist headed out to a fossil site with his young niece and nephew. Oddly they speed down a dirt road in Alaska in a pickup truck and there seems to be an effort being made to make this ride ... adventurous? Its actually pretty strange and really doesnt tie into anything else in the story but the first couple of minutes feature this wacky score and Uncle Zack looking goofy about the impending frivolity of digging dinos. His niece (Angourie Rice) is excited shes a bit younger but his nephew (Charlie Rowe) is less than enthused about the whole field trip. Hes the teenager type that is far more interested in cellular phone coverage than dinosaur bones. Uncle Zack tries to get him excited about discovering some history but no dice and once they get onsite young Ricky chooses to stay at the car and try to find service for his phone. But then outta nowhere a crow appears and then the crow morphs into an ancient bird. Yep hes got a story to tell the tale of Patchi (voiced by Justin Long) the little Pachyrhinosaurus that could. Patchi and his brother Skowler (voiced by Skyler Stone) are growing up in the last days of the Cretaceous period 70 million years ago back before things got so corporate. Patchi and Skowler are part of a large herd of Pachyrhinos and their dad is the leader of their pack. Of course as you probably already know these are the dinosaurs that headbutt each other for dominance and ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" will have plenty of that action to throw your way too. Thankfully once the ""dinosaur"" angle of ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" starts the film is in much more fluid territory to the point where they probably should have just started there in the first place. Storywise the only real criticism to be leveled at ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" is its stubborn insistence that narrative tension must be attained and then re-attained though its not clear whom this technique is meant to benefit. Surely adults in the audience must know the main character wont be killed off in a horrific manner eaten by a pack of snapping and writhing predators right? Where the children are concerned Im not sure where the ""value add"" comes from in going to this well three or four times either. While they will probably will get a bit bent out of shape that this cool character theyve been watching is about to get eaten up but to what end? Yes the story arc and pacing present themselves as potential liabilities here no doubt about it but again these are minute-long problems not movie-long ones. Theres an ill-conceived love angle and its probably about ten minutes too long but its hard to get too persnickety about anything ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" is looking to accomplish because its big dinosaur heart is in the right place. As we continue along the journey with Patchi and his lovable bird friend Alex (John Leguizamo) theres plenty of visual majesty and a number of good-natured laughs. This is one of the few films that actually has an argument as to why it should be presented in 3-D and the effects are first rate. Everything transpires in about the manner youd expect and theres nothing remotely challenging about the material but overall youll walk away feeling entertained. And your children? Well you may have a whole new epoch to consider afterward the one where you end up buying a bunch of dinosaur books and toys. SCORE 6.7 / 10 Laremy wrote the book on film criticism and thinks it was a bad idea to name them the Toronto Raptors.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The 3-D animated family film Walking With Dinosaurs shares a title and a production company with an acclaimed BBC miniseries but itd be a major mistake to confuse one for the other. The small-screen version which first aired in 1999 had the novel idea of giving CGI dinosaurs their own nature documentary ""observing"" them in the same way a National Geographic special observes penguins or wildebeest. Originally this big-screen extension of the Walking brand was going to adopt the same approach just on a grander scale. Along the way however someone apparently reasoned that kids wouldnt sit still for a movie in which dinosaurs--those amazing captivating occupants of ancient Earth--dont have nattering conversations or learn important life lessons about bravery. And so heres the new but not improved Walking With Dinosaurs which not only saddles its prehistoric attractions with sassy banter but also inserts them into an impossibly generic coming-of-age adventure. Were he real John Hammond might approve of such hucksterism.As if anticipating the patronage of slightly-too-old-for-this adolescents the filmmakers supply a framing device in which a talking bird introduces a bored teenager to the wonders of the Mesozoic Era. (Heres hoping Karl Urban who plays the kids paleontologist uncle got paid handsomely for his day or so on set.) Narrated by the feathered guide (John Leguizamo in warmed-over Ice Age mode) Walking With Dinosaurs focuses on the plight of a young Pachyrhinosaurus voiced by a plucky Justin Long. Narratively speaking the film is less indebted to The Land Before Time than to Bambi from which it borrows a raging forest fire the death of a parent and a bit of spring-fever romance. Curiously only a few dino species even make appearances with the Gorgosaurus filling the toothy fearsome adversary quota. There are however plenty of poop and vomit jokes (for the very young) and pop-song montages (for the musically indiscriminate). Admittedly the effects work is pretty strong. Directors Barry Cook and Neil Nightingale place their scaly hyper-detailed creations against actual physical backdrops seamlessly immersing fake fauna in real nature. But given how quickly CGI tends to age thats a transient triumph. (Character designer David Krentz also worked on Disneys Dinosaur whose effects have--to put it kindly--not held up so well.) As a teaching tool the movie is especially suspect Though the filmmakers flash the full names of the dinos on-screen such interest in classification--and in getting kids hooked on natural history--feels like a begrudging afterthought. Not that anyone should look to this lazy underdog story starring anthropomorphized animals saying things like ""We should have brought more layers"" as a source of hard science. Instructive mainly for screenwriters looking for tips on what not to do Walking With Dinosaurs takes the education out of ""educational entertainment."" The entertainment too.

"Walking With Dinosaurs 2 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article Walking With Dinosaurs 2 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments By Barbara VanDenburgh The Republic | azcentral.com Wed Dec 18 2013 1154 AM Kids dig dinosaurs. And whats not to dig? Big teeth sharp claws a tendency to headbutt things and a sense of majesty that taps into the primal wonder we harbor for the natural world. And they occasionally make for rousing narratives from the tearjerking heroics of ""The Land Before Time"" to the roaring thrills of ""Jurassic Park"" to the educational 1999 BBC series ""Walking With Dinosaurs"" -- upon which this big-screen 3-D spectacle ostensibly is based. But for a film that purports to love dinosaurs this bigger flashier ""Walking With Dinosaurs"" sure doesnt trust them to be interesting enough to carry five minutes of a movie without the copious aid of slapstick and bathroom humor in a screenplay so rote it makes creatures that have been dead for 65 million years feel less fossilized than the jokes. It kicks off with the first of a pair of eye-rollingly bad bookends set in modern-day Alaska where a paleontologist uncle attempts to instill in a pair of teenagers a sense of awe for the late Cretaceous period. When one surly teenager scoffs at fossil-digging in favor of playing on his cellphone a chatty bird named Alex (voiced by John Leguizamo) takes umbrage. ""Every fossil tells a story"" he says whisking the boy back in time to a picturesque real-world Alaska populated by computer-animated dinosaurs. The story that fossils tell unfortunately isnt a very good one. The star of the tired zero-to-hero story line is Patchi (Justin Long) a runty herbivorous Pachyrhinosaurus who spends most of a great-migration time wisecracking with Alex fighting with his beefy brother Scowler and being in love with token girl dinosaur Juniper. None has much in the way of a discernible personality (unless being a girl is a personality) which makes it hard to care when theyre beset by the elements ranging from forest fires to carnivores during their winter migration to warmer weather. To the movies credit the migration certainly looks cool. Filmed largely in Alaska and New Zealand the sweeping landscapes are profound and beautiful. Unfortunately theres no majestic visual this movie cant undercut with bathroom humor as the charmless characters chatter simply to fill the space. Not even aurora borealis is spared. And the animated dinosaurs are less breathtaking. Confoundingly the dinosaurs mouths dont move when they talk making it seem as if they communicate through a sort of prehistoric telepathy that nevertheless conforms to natural laws (e.g. muffled voices when they talk while eating). Maybe that spared the animation budget but it also makes it difficult to tell whos talking in any given scene that features multiple similar-looking dinosaurs; its especially maddening when youre left grasping for context clues to determine whats dialogue and whats narration. Dont trouble yourself. Any movie that features multiple scenes of gross bodily expulsions being ingested isnt much worth understanding.

TWITTER Dinosaurs rule the earth in this big-budget 3D feature update of the late 90s TV show. A supersized riff on the acclaimed BBC series of the same name Walking With Dinosaurs takes rewarding advantage of a much bigger budget and state-of-the-art technology to bring its impressive collection of Cretaceous creatures to vivid life. But while the walking parts pretty impressive the talking part -- not so much. Apparently convinced that the films young target audience wouldnt be sufficiently engaged by those remarkably lifelike main characters and a colorful prehistoric parrot (voiced by John Leguizamo) serving as narrator the powers that be saw fit to add needless dialogue. PHOTOS Brrrrrrr Disneys Frozen and 19 Other Wintry Movies Given that the dinosaurs mouths dont move while the voice cast delivers some truly throwaway lines its safe to assume that the overlay was added after the fact especially considering the evident care and detail that went into the other renderings. While the end result often finds those visual and audio elements butting heads with each other the heavily marketed Twentieth Century Fox release should still unearth some impressive holiday numbers. The six-part series that inspired the movie (not to mention a successful live arena spectacular) originally aired on the BBC in 1999 and was ultimately seen by 700 million viewers globally. Recruited to exploit the brand for theatrical consumption were co-directors Barry Cook (Mulan) and Neil Nightingale creative director of BBC Earth whose different sensibilities would seem ideal for a movie that attempts to graft the series documentary style onto a more traditional animated feature format. PHOTOS The 15 Most Insane Animal Attack Movies Bookended by very brief modern-day live-action sequences the proceedings waste little time in going back some 70 million years to tell the coming-of-age story of Patchi (voiced by Justin Long) an underdog of a young Pachyrhinosaurus whos shown the ropes by the flighty Alex (Leguizamo). Along his trek to adulthood Patchi crosses paths with various prehistoric predators including the fearsome Gorgosauraus as well as locking horns with his older brother and the eventual leader of the herd Scowler (Skyler Stone) and experiencing love at first sight courtesy of the fetching Juniper (Tiya Sircar). Although the plotting credited to screenwriter John Collee (Happy Feet Master and Commander) follows a safely predictable course the visual element employing the cutting-edge 3D Fusion Camera System used by James Cameron for Avatar delivers the strikingly dimensional dino goods set against actual backdrops in Alaska and New Zealand. Its that forced unnecessary and largely unfunny dialogue -- save for Leguizamos spirited way with words -- that comes up distractingly flat.
