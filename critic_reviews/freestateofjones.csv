Newkirk II Jun 28 2016 Culture ""Somehow some way and some time everybody is somebody elses nigger"" is an actual quote that happens around midway through Free State of Jones. Uttered by Matthew McConaugheys Newton Knight a Confederate nurse-turned-deserter-turned-freedom-fighter in defense of one of his black comrades its perhaps the most oblivious remark about race in a film that is remarkable mostly for its astounding oblivion about race. At that point an hour and change into a narrative slog as thick as the Mississippi swamp where Knight and his diverse buddies hide it becomes apparent that the film is going nowhere fast. Related Story Why the Roots Remake Is So Important But to cast Free State of Jones aside as just another bad summer movie might be missing the point. Written and directed by Gary Ross its held back by a slow disjointed plot that doesnt quite know what it wants to do and it betrays no signs of having attempted to develop characters. But with its badness comes a real opportunity for instruction The films ideas about race and its main character Knight are textbook examples of how not to have conversations about white privilege ""allyship"" and black struggle. As such they invite a closer look.To say that McConaugheys portrayal of Newton Knight is a white savior perhaps undersells the trope. After a tragedy sparks his desertion from the Confederate cause he realizes that his opposition to the Civil War as ""a poor mans fight"" is the moral fiber that drives him. A strange jumble of circumstances unexplained moral convictions and a touch of deus ex machina find Knight hiding in a matcha-green swamp amongst a group of impossibly trusting escaped slaves. In perhaps the single touch of insightful racial commentary in the film this band of enslaved folks have all forsaken their birth names in favor of those of Biblical prophets. Their leader played by House of Cardss Mahershala Ali is the underutilized and largely unexplored Moses.Its unclear how Knight became such an impossibly good person but his brief time between desertion and swamp life sees him level up from a scurrying battlefield nurse to something akin to a mix of Robin Hood and Prometheus. In the course of 20 screen minutes Knight frees enslaved people from manacles gives them guns and begins teaching them how to read. His philosophy that economic justice underpins all societal ills seems to motivate his strange goodness and also allows him the inhuman ability to recruit white Mississippians into the ranks of the escaped slaves to form a group of economic freedom fighters who only bicker once about race. Newton Knight is the wokest white dude. Hes so woke that both he and the movie abandon his white wife and child to pursue his romance and eventual marriage with Rachel (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) a mulatto slave who falls for him simply because it serves the plot.This is a quasi-historical telling and--spoiler alert--the war ends and Knights title sovereignty gives way to Reconstruction. The film loses its narrative way and becomes a mashup of vignettes around this point but the vignettes each recall some real-world commentary on race and current events. Theres a massacre of freedmen in a church that evokes Dylann Roofs 2015 massacre in Charleston; theres a mother fretting over her son potentially becoming the victim of violence; there are scenes of purposeful anti-black voter intimidation and suppression. Theres a lynching. Despite the fact that all of these incidents happen to black characters its Knight who is always front and center issuing platitudes about economics poor folks and rightness in McConaugheys textbook drawl. Theres even a scene where Knight leads a group of grown black men to the ballot box because they are too afraid to do so otherwise.Its high time that the southern Civil War mythology is complicated with the fullness of its roster of heroes.I have a soft spot for white-savior films in all their moral simplicity and naivete--I still laugh at the absurdity of Dangerous Minds and The Last Samurai--but Free State of Jones may be the most egregious Ive ever seen. Its lack of self-awareness and the immensity of its privilege are palpable. But all that privilege reflects how real-life conversations about race have often gone. As black activists have pushed the country past its post-racial fever dream and into a space where race is a common--often commodified--topic it pays as a white person with a certain liberal sensitivity to claim wokeness a brand of awareness of the continued existence of racism characterized by consumption of famous black theorists and the use of the word ""ally.""McConaugheys Knight is a gun-toting avatar of Woke Whiteness a man whos both a stylistic and philosophical forefather to so many Millennial social-media users. His message of universal class-based solidarity as outlined in his quote about ownership of niggers is as inadequate as theirs in actually identifying and exploring the roots of racial oppression in America. The notion that white people can be ""niggers"" is about as offensive as they come when considering the history of the epithet and how its long been utilized by poor whites as a demarcation between whiteness--even its lowest rungs--and blackness. Theres a reason why black people were lynched for voting during Reconstruction and are shot for standing on corners today--one that Knights political revolution completely fails to comprehend.A better film would have muddled the clean white-savior narrative with an actual exploration of what the racial politics of a mixed-race insurgency in the South might have been like. Hell Id watch a do-over that focused on just how they really got poor white farmers to fight alongside freed slaves--by all accounts their mortal social enemies--and what happened when things inevitably broke down in the swamps. Id love to see how white farmers and freedmen alike viewed Knight a man of obvious leadership talents who took a white wife and a black wife. If not Newton Knight Id like stories about John Brown or other militant abolitionists. Those stories would benefit from a narrative that doesnt center the white hero to the point of absurdity (this particular story would have been much better with Rachel or Moses as the lead). They might even tell us something about how to have more productive conversations about race today.As Slates Jamelle Bouie has noted its high time that the southern Civil War mythology is complicated with the fullness of its roster of heroes and some of the multi-layered racial and class politics that led to the real-life Knight creating a mixed-race community in the backwoods of the heart of the Confederacy. Its also high time for the richness of the agency of slaves especially enslaved women to be explored. And its long past time that the dialectic of how to be a racially conscious responsible and good white person in a diversifying world is challenged. Its probably hard to be a truly woke white person in a time of changing mores and an ever-increasing challenge to accountability and introspection by black activists as Justin Timberlakes recent awkward Twitter response to black activism illustrates. The answer to each of these is probably to study everything that Free State of Jones did and do the opposite.

Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

At the end of 2013 in the low-slung industrial Taiwanese city of Kaohsiung a bevy of officials came to attend the ribbon cutting of a huge former hotel that had undergone a top-to-bottom multimillion-dollar renovation.

Graham A federal appeals court finds the impact of the states voting law can only be explained by ""discriminatory intent."" Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz.

Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion. Continue Reading Mike Segar / Reuters The Most Inspiring and Depressing Moment of the Democratic Convention Uri Friedman The father of a Muslim American who died in Iraq confronts Donald Trump. Khizr Khan began his speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday with words I wish he didnt have to say ""Tonight we are honored to stand here as parents of Captain Humayun Khan and as patriotic American Muslims--as patriotic American Muslims with undivided loyalty to our country."" I wish he and his wife didnt have to stand there as the parents of a 27-year-old Army captain who was killed by suicide bombers while serving in the Iraq War. And I wish Khizr Khan hadnt felt the need to declare his patriotism and loyalty to the United States of America. Those truths should have been self-evident. The state of the union is not strong when an American feels compelled to clarify such things. In better times Khizr Khan who was born in Pakistan and moved to America from the United Arab Emirates might have begun his speech with what he said next ""Like many immigrants we came to this country empty-handed. We believed in American democracy--that with hard work and [the] goodness of this country we could share in and contribute to its blessings.""

A sex offender is thrown in the stocks presented with a small child and asked if he wants to molest him. A mob of protestors is thrown a ""dummy full of guts"" that is stomped to pieces within seconds. A radio host insists that pedophiles have ""more genes in common with crabs"" than the rest of humanity insisting ""Theres no real evidence for [that] but it is scientific fact."" Its hard to pinpoint the most cringe-inducing moment on ""Paedogeddon"" a special episode of the British TV satire Brass Eye. But 15 years after the episode aired it remains a totemic terrifying satirical vision. Few comedies since have dared to cross the boundaries of taste with such impunity. ""Paedogeddon"" aired in the U.K. in the summer of 2001 a year after the murder of a young girl had sparked national hysteria over the countrys sex-offender registry. Britains most-read newspaper led a campaign to publish the names and locations of all 110000 convicted sex offenders prompting a riot in which an angry mob ransacked the home of an ex-con. Brass Eye a parody of a 60 Minutes-like newsmagazine show had been dormant after airing one season in the UK in 1997. But it returned four years later for this surprise broadcast one that saw its furious (fictional) anchors barking from a dark studio about the plague of seemingly super-powered child molesters stalking the nation holding a funhouse mirror up to the climate of paranoia and fear that had built up around the country. It was a bold wildly insensitive piece of comedy but one that captured the growing madness of the 24-hour news media and foreshadowed some uglier aspects of its future.

Is the McConaissance well and truly over? Looks like it Matthew McConaughey stars in this strident half-successful Civil War drama a movie that leans too hard on its stars Southern-fried smoothness (which is getting to be a joke Oscars coronation aside). Free State of Jones certainly looks and sounds right and probably smells right too--these gunky Mississippi battles and unwashed soldiers feel authentic. The problem as with McConaugheys performance is that you always do feel it. The film is in your face like a brown-nosing student waiving his hand in the front row because he knows the answer. The irony here is that McConaugheys character--the controversial real-life rebel Newton Knight a Unionist who broke from the Confederacy while still remaining racist--could have been exactly the kind of complex role the actor needs. For this overlong plot Knights rougher edges have been sanded down. Theres lots of slave-freeing speech-giving and interracial-romancing (with Gugu Mbatha-Raw in an underwritten part) but little of the kind of cryptic opacity McConaughey is capable of. Writer-director Gary Ross (Pleasantville Seabiscuit) knows how to please crowds so theres fascination in his consistently wrongheaded impulse to add more historical details lengthy scenes of exposition even a leap decades into the future for a courtroom drama involving Knights persecuted offspring. Hes lost sight of the powerful drama at this storys heart about the ennobling swirl of momentous events.

Newton Knight (Matthew McConaughey) a Mississippi medic in the Confederate Army is infuriated by draft exemptions extended to slave owners and angered by taxation of small farmers. He deserts and takes refuge in a swampland among a group of runaway slaves which includes the fiercely principled Moses (Mahershala Ali) and the medically gifted Rachel (Gugu Mbatha-Raw).

Ross carries the action through to Reconstruction and the bloody rise of the K.K.K.; an amazing sidebar set in the nineteen-forties involves Davis Knight (Brian Lee Franklin) a great-grandson of Newton and Rachel whose marriage to a white woman is challenged in a Mississippi court. Rosss powerful assemblage of information offers little psychology symbolic resonance or practical politics. He links economic and racial justice but skimps on the details despite the cautionary reminder that the Civil War and the freeing of slaves were followed by a century of violent racism that remains unredressed.      --Richard Brody Goings On A free New York City events app What to do tonight Follow goingson About Us FAQ Strongbox Customer Care Cartoon Bank On The Town RSS Contact Us The New Yorker Store Careers Reprints/Permissions Press The New Yorker Media Kit Conde Nast Digital Subscribe to a magazine View All Titles - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Bon Appetit Brides Conde Nast Traveler Details Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Lucky Self Teen Vogue The New Yorker Vanity Fair Vogue W Wired Other Conde Nast sites - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Ars Technica Bon Appetit Brides.com Conde Nast Traveler Concierge Details Epicurious Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Hotel Chatter Jaunted Lucky NutritionData Reddit The Scene Self Style Teen Vogue Vanity Fair Vegas Chatter Vogue W Wired Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement (effective January 1 2014) and Privacy Policy (effective January 1 2014).

Privacy Policy or Movie review McConaughey captures hero of Free State of Jones Katie Walsh Tribune News Service on Jun 22 2016 Published in Entertainment News Subscribe Subscribe Your email is safe with us. Privacy Policy or Matthew McConaughey -- lean dark with hollowed darting eyes -- portrays the real-life Civil War rebel Newton Knight in ""Free State of Jones"" written and directed by Gary Ross with a story by Leonard Hartman. Its a film that grapples with the reverberations of this period throughout our collective American conscience and proves to be a richly rendered history lesson. Its undeniably politically charged and deeply complex especially through the lens of 2016. Period pieces cant just be interpreted for the era in which they take place but also the era in which they are made and this one doesnt offer easy answers.Knight was a farmer Confederate deserter and eventual guerrilla rebel fighting for racial and economic equality. His legacy extends to the 1948 miscegenation trial of his great-grandson Davis Knight (Brian Lee Franklin) descended from Knights union with former slave Rachel (Gugu Mbatha-Raw). These timelines intersect in the film demonstrating Knights personal legacy in the journey toward equality but the main plot is the tale of Knights rebellion in Jones County Mississippi and subsequent struggles during Reconstruction.McConaughey pitches his performance right into that sweet spot of feral nobility that marks his best work and its effortless -- McConaughey just exists as Knight on screen. Ross approaches the intense material with a sense of thoughtful contemplation and an even languid pacing. The photography of French cinematographer Benoit Delhomme underlines this approach everything framed just so the emerald chamber of the swamp where the rebels hide out; a soldiers head caved in by a bullet. The camera quietly observes all.Its clear that Ross bit off more than he can chew in ""Free State of Jones."" The story lolls and wallows in wartime violence and the rebellion then rushes through the horrors and trauma of Reconstruction relying on text titles to speed through the historical context. Paired with archival photos these sections offer authenticity but feel more like a PBS documentary.Knight astutely calls out the Civil War for what it was an economic dispute driven by profit margins and craven capitalism wherein rich slave owners exploited poor white folks and African-American slaves alike. But this is a false equivalency and Knight eventually has to figure that out the hard way. Its nearly impossible to reconcile so many difficult sociopolitical issues in the life story of one man but Knights ideals were radically modern and he lived them fully.Any American anti-government libertarian tale goes hand in hand with firepower and ""Free State of Jones"" does offer up a strong argument for the Second Amendment a battle that rages on today. Guns are the supporting characters in the film -- always close at hand used to throw off tyranny and symbolic as gifts currency even books. Guns are protectors of the vulnerable. Knight places shotguns in the hands of tiny girls and tells them to aim for the Rebs whove come to collect supplies. ""Gun dont care whos pulling the trigger"" he drawls. Unfortunately theres a devastating ironic truth to that line that enacts itself everyday in America.While the dream of the egalitarian libertarian utopia of Jones proves elusive ""Free State of Jones"" susses out and manifests what has become the real American dream prosperity. Its a dream planted here with gunpowder and watered with blood. You do indeed reap what you sow for better or for worse.FREE STATE OF JONES2.5 out of 4 starsCast Matthew McConaughey Keri Russell Gugu Mbatha-Raw Mahershala Ali Brian Lee Franklin Jacob LoflandDirected by Gary RossRunning time 2 hours 19 minutesRated R for brutal battle scenes and disturbing graphic images.(c)2016 Tribune Content Agency LLCDistributed by Tribune Content Agency LLC.

June 23 2016The Neon DemonStarring Elle Fanning Jena Malone Abbey Lee Bella Heathcoate Keanu Reeves and Christina Hendricks. Directed by Nicolas Winding Refn. Opens Friday at major theatres. 117 minutes. 14AThe ideal audience for The Neon Demon would be a theatre where every seat had a mirror tilted toward the screen. This is a film in love with its own reflection one that is by turns gorgeous and horrifying.Director Nicolas Winding Refn (Drive Only God Forgives) is convinced that profundity resides beneath the shallows of narcissism. Its a tough sell but an intoxicating one especially upon subsequent viewings.Article Continued BelowRefn is hardly the first moviemaker to find a link between supermodels and scary monsters but he may be the most style-minded one to make the connection. Imagine an issue of Vogue with Maleficent as guest editor.The Neon Demon swoons along with the Hollywood denizens who encounter Elle Fannings Jesse a hayseed with an angels face (but maybe not the innocence) who seeks L.A. stardom just past the age of 16. Her beauty youth and implacability ruffle the feathers and sharpen the teeth of fixated fashionistas played by Jena Malone Abbey Lee and Bella Heathcote all slightly older than Jesse (20 is considered ancient in this jaded realm). They jealously consider her both a threat and a celestial presence ""Youre the sun"" one hungrily admires.Jesse lives in a Pasadena motel managed by Keanu Reeves sleazy Hank who has more kinks than a Slinky. Yet he -- and the mountain lion that somehow breaks into her room -- pose merely natural threats.Frequent Refn collaborator Cliff Martinez heightens the dread with his seductive electronic score which beautifully meshes with Natasha Braiers iridescent cinematography. Together they make the vapid seem deep.- Peter HowellTickledDocumentary directed by David Farrier and Dylan Reeve. Opens Friday at Bloor Hot Docs Cinema. 91 minutes. PGThis New Zealand doc tickles the funny bone but also chills the spine. It delves into a goofy fetish that leads down serious and unsettling paths. Journalist David Farrier and co-director Dylan Reeve begin their film as a humorous report on a peculiar yet apparently harmless ""sport"" called ""Competitive Endurance Tickling."" Farrier specializes in ""looking at the weird and bizarre side of life"" and this certainly qualifies.He and Reeve get way more than they bargained for. Their investigation follows a labyrinth of Internet links involving cyberbullying identity fraud online shaming and extortion. Not much should be said about the film going in -- it proceeds like a thriller -- but its no spoiler to say that anyone who has seen the 2010 doc Catfish will recognize how deception is now very much a part of online activities.- Peter HowellFree State of JonesStarring Matthew McConaughey Gugu Mbatha-Raw Mahershala Ali and Keri Russell. Directed by Gary Ross. Opens Friday at major theatres. 120 minutes. 14AA Civil War rebellion becomes an enervating movie by Gary Ross.Determined to instruct more than inspire producer/director/writer Ross (Hunger Games) unspools a fact-based and overly familiar historical narrative of the righteous white freedom fighter. Matthew McConaughey capably stars as Newton Knight an 1860s Mississippi farmer rebelling against war and slavery although in so doing he creates his own militia of former slaves and fellow farmers. The first half proceeds well enough when Knight and his conscripts are defending their land against both Confederate and Union forces. Two renegade slaves emerge as particular allies -- Gugu Mbatha-Raws Rachel and Mahershala Alis Moses -- but its clearly the bigger stars movie.The story splinters in the postwar second half when too much exposition is crammed in (including a 20th century court case) and momentum is lost.- Peter HowellHunt for the WilderpeopleStarring Sam Neill Julian Dennison Rima Te Wiata and Rachel House. Written and directed by Taika Waititi. Opens Friday at Cineplex Yonge amp; Dundas. 101 minutes. PGNew Zealand writer-director Taika Waititi blends sharply cynical humour with huge heart in arguably his best film to date Hunt for the Wilderpeople. Pudgy Ricky Baker (a perfect Julian Dennison) has been written off as a bad egg by childrens services.But foster ""aunt"" Bella (Rima Te Wiata) sees the good in the oddball kid who expresses himself with crude haikus even if her cranky husband Hec (Sam Neill) has no time for the newcomer.Circumstances send Ricky on the run deep into the wilderness bush with survivorman Hec. Their adventure blends humour and warmth as the two chafe share secrets and warily bond. Gorgeous scenery excellent cast and a freshly clever script from Waititi who also triumphed with Boy and What We Do in the Shadows make for a must-see film.- Linda BarnardFastball (DVD)Documentary on the most feared baseball pitch written and directed by Jonathan Hock. Narrated by Kevin Costner. Available on DVD June 28. STCESPN director Jonathan Hock throws straight and true with this history of baseballs most important pitch.Hock illuminates and entertains as he sketches portraits of the greats from original fireballer Walter Johnson to the indomitable Nolan Ryan. Batters cant always see a fastball but they sure can hear it ""It sounds like trouble"" says ex-Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter.Combining rare archival footage with contemporary interviews Hock chases both the legend and science of the fastball something that couldnt even be precisely measured until the radar gun arrived in the 1970s.We learn why theres a world of difference between a 92 mph (148.12 km/h) ball and a 100 mph (161 km/h) one and why physicists dispute batters claim of a ""rise"" over the plate.Dont listen to them record hitter Hank Aaron says ""I dont believe they ever played baseball.""- Peter Howell The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Murray Close/STX Productions/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide In ""Free State of Jones"" Matthew McConaughey plays the real-life figure Newton Knight a Mississippi farmer who enlisted a group of renegade slaves and white Southerners for a rebellion against the Confederacy. Its a powerful story but as written and directed by Gary Ross it has a by-the-books straightforwardness that sacrifices nuance for homiletics. Newton is valiant from the get-go when as a medic in the Confederate Army he witnesses the death of a young boy he befriended and goes rogue. Nothing really roils his sense of mission. McConaughey is convincing as far as the role allows him to go which in psychological terms isnt all that far.In supporting roles Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Rachel the equally valiant house slave Newton makes his common-law wife and Mahershala Ali as Moses the leader of the renegade slaves provide some powerful moments.

Brad Wheeler The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 24 2016 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Jun. 24 2016 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Gary Ross Written by Gary Ross Starring Matthew McConaughey Gugu Mbatha-Raw Keri Russell Classification 14A Country USA Language English In the determinedly intense and historically honest Civil War yarn Free State of Jones Matthew McConaugheys guerrilla soldier-farmer shows someone how to shoot a gun explaining the difference between half-cocked and full-cocked. Nobody does full-cock better than McConaughey. Here he plays Newt Knight a controversial real-life figure who deserted the Confederate Army for principled reasons and became the inspirational rebel leader of a ragtag mixed-race group of dissatisfied Mississippians. Directed by Gary Ross (Seabiscuit) the saga lacks the magic odyssey of something like Cold Mountain and doesnt quite have the battle-happy thrill that the films trailer promises. The chemistry between McConaughey and Gugu Mbatha-Raw (as his Creole common-law wife) is non-existent their ""romance"" basically consisting of one conversation about biscuits. Instead of captivating us with swagger McConaughey chooses to go grim and dogged. Director Ross does the same.

Call it a civil bore.Matthew McConaughey stars as Newton Knight a Confederate soldier who defects from the war and establishes his own community in the swamps of Mississippi eventually leading a rebellion against the Confederacy.He first teams up with a gang of runaway slaves including Moses (Mahershala Ali) who is outfitted with a gruesome spiked iron torture device around his neck. Knight offers to free him of it even though the clanging will echo throughout the swamps and invite the attention of soldiers and their dogs.No problem Knight quickly -- too quickly -- teaches his new crew how to fire weapons and become ace marksmen and they swiftly dispose of the soldiers and roast the dogs for food.Knights reputation grows and he attracts more soldiers women and slaves eventually forming a free society that under the films star becomes something of the United States of McConaughey. He doesnt say ""alright alright alright"" but the Oscar winners rough-hewn dude charm is never far from the surface even underneath his scraggly beard and wily eyes.As Knight becomes the groups leader town preacher and moral center he takes on numerous racial injustices and breaks down a tough war into overly simplistic terms.McConaughey is earnest and noble in the lead role moreso than history might have you believe about the real Knight. Writer-director Gary Ross (working from a story by Leonard Hartman) buffs the edges off Knights character and practically puts him in a cape turning him into a symbol rather than a man.And the movie becomes a symbol too a checklist of Americas racial hatred that wants to draw parallels to today. We get N-word speechifying the birth of the KKK and a history of voting prejudice all of which feel crammed in despite the films laborious 139-minute running time.Mahershala Ali left and Gugu Mbatha-Raw star in the Civil War drama. (Photo Murray Close / STX Productions)Ross (""Seabiscuit"" the first ""Hunger Games"" film) stuffs so much into his story -- including a 1940s court case thats wedged in like a jam underneath a door -- that hes forced to offer up title cards that act as explainers to fill the narrative gaps in his story.Meanwhile the women in the film -- Keri Russell plays Knights wife Serena and Gugu Mbatha-Raw is Rachel the former slave whom Knight teaches to read and takes as his common-law wife -- are wasted reduced to sad and pretty faces respectively.Ross stages several battle scenes with a bloody realism that is graphicly jarring. But his attempts to lend the film a ""12 Years a Slave""-style grit are undercut by his own need to tidy everything up into pre-packaged take home lessons War is bad racism is worse etc.Early in the film Knight is disillusioned when a young soldier hes offered to mentor is suddenly killed. ""He died with honor Newt"" a fellow soldier tells him while Newt rebuts ""No he just died."" The same can be said for ""Free State of Jones.""agrahamdetroitnews.com(313) 222-2284twitter.com/grahamoramaFree State of JonesGRADE CRated R for brutal battle scenes and disturbing graphic imagesRunning time 139 minutes 12 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/28Qploz TOP VIDEOS Oakland County Sheriff car chase052East Detroit Schools CEO superintendent ready to work together333Trump denies he encouraged Russia to hack Clinton emails035Donald Trump discusses pulling out of NAFTA tariff for Ford123Zoom Gas Station029Surveillance video of breaking and entering029Highland Park eco village brings basics back to Avalon Street2572016 Festival of Chariots parade154Debbie Dingell adresses unity town hall meeting118World Peace mural135 MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/columnists/adam-graham/2016/06/23/movie-review-free-state-jones-cuts-corners-civil-war/86317656/,200,freestateofjones8,freestateofjones,detroitnews

Slideshow Free State of Jones Matthew McConaugheys Civil War epic sure is long Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon Its a trite obvious point but it bears repeating given the gross generalizations about the South we get in so many Civil War movies. Oscar-nominated writer producer and director Gary Ross (Seabiscuit The Hunger Games) hammers home that point most insistently and repetitiously in Free State of Jones a pedantic overlong 139-minute epic about Newton Knight a little-known real-life hero from Jones County Miss. who took up arms against Johnny Reb. Mixing elements from documentaries biopics war flicks and Hallmark romances Ross film is a living history tour but with gory special effects and a smoldering smattering of sex appeal. The sizzle is provided by Matthew McConaughey as Knight and the delightful British up-and-comer Gugu Mbatha-Raw (Concussion Jupiter Ascending) as Rachel whos his wife and partner in crime and a former slave. A poor farmer from Jones County Knight was so disgusted by the economic motives behind the Souths secession that he deserted from the Confederate Army. As McConaughey breaks it down to his fellow soldiers in rather simplistic terms the fat cats who own plantations get rich exploiting free slave labor and then safeguard their wealth by sending off impoverished white folks to fight their wars. Knight recruits fellow deserters and runaway slaves to form a guerrilla army in support of the Union arguing that they share the same enemy. Constructed of tightly edited episodes Free State of Jones uses on-screen text to document dates and locations as it follows his activities through the last three years of the war. Ross documents everything - including the violent battle scenes and the budding love story between Knight and Rachel - with a studied cool detachment. Its a blessing Theres so much melodrama here a more emotive approach would have yielded a sickly sweet soap opera. The film reaches a natural climax with the end of the war but then it keeps going - and going and going - through Reconstruction the rise of the Ku Klux Klan and the adoption of Jim Crow laws. Theres even a subplot about Davis Knight a great-grandson of Newton Knight and Rachel who was tried and convicted in 1946 of breaking Mississippis laws against interracial marriage. I admire Ross for his refusal to end the story on a note of false hope He follows through on the history of Jones County to show how life for freed slaves and their descendants would not fundamentally change for a century. But its just too much history for a single film. Instead of making us hungry for more we feel overwhelmed. tirdadphillynews.com 215-854-2736 MOVIE REVIEW Free State of Jones 2 1/2 stars (Out of four stars). Directed by Gary Ross.

Like the worst civics lesson this movie bores away at you till your reactions are dulled. More News Summer Movie Preview 2016 Attack of the Blockbuster Clones Qamp;A The Americans Star Keri Russell on Playing the Spy Next Door 11 Best Movies of 2016 So Far All Stories >> Related 20 Best Matthew McConaughey Performances From the alright to the all right all right all right here are the greatest acting turns from the Interstellar star Matthew McConaughey sucked dry of his usual acting panache plays Newton Knight a real-life Mississippi farmer and army nurse who rebelled against the Confederacy with a militia of fellow deserters and renegade slaves. ""Everybody is just somebody elses ner"" he tells his ragtag troops. A new law declares that that anyone who owns 20 slaves can avoid military service bolstering Newts claim that this is ""a poor mans fighting a rich mans war."" After Newts possessions are seized and his wife Serena (Keri Russell) takes off in terror Newt runs for the swamps and starts fomenting a revolution that will declare Jones county a state and free its citizens of allegiance to North or South. Its a tall order and a potentially exciting one that writer-director Gary Ross (Seabiscuit Pleasantville the first Hunger Games) dripples away with historical footnotes that break the cardinal rule of drama show dont tell. Even when Newt takes house slave Rachel (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) as his common-law wife and frees another slave Moses (Mahershala Ali) from his shackles to develop his powers as a leader Newt remains outsider his own story another in a long line of Hollywoods white saviors. What is this dude really thinking? What are the flaws in his character? Where is his secret heart? Not in this movie. Free State of Jones keeps flashing forward to a future where black lives still dont matter. After the Civil War ends freed slaves are still bought and sold but this time under the category of ""apprentice.""  The Ku Klux Klan is born to enforce inherent racism. In 1940 Newt and Rachels great-grandson is jailed for marrying a white woman. We get the point but that doesnt stop Ross from hammering it again and again -- and without the passion that would make it come alive onscreen. Free State of Jones needed to blow the dust off history so that it stings for the here and now. What we get is a droning sermon that sacrifices urgent immediacy for moral rectitude. Damn shame.

"Review Free State of Jones bares forgotten Civil War tale Skip to main content Latest News The Conversation Review Free State of Jones bares forgotten Civil War tale By LINDSEY BAHR Jun. 23 2016 502 PM EDT Share article 10 photos This image released by STX Productions shows Matthew McConaughey and Jacob Lofland in a scene from ""The Free State of Jones."" (Murray Close/STX Productions via AP) i By LINDSEY BAHR (AP)Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed.Newton Knight was a poor Mississippi farmer and Confederate soldier who deserted the Army in early 1862 waged a rebellion against the Confederacy and ended up forming a little colony of exiles which they referred to as the Free State of Jones. Their numbers rose with deserters as the Confederate effort floundered. They even took over Jones County and raised an American flag at the courthouse. Its a fascinating slice of forgotten history. Coming after three years after ""12 Years a Slave"" made sure wed never forget the name Solomon Northup its not unreasonable to expect that maybe ""Free State of Jones "" could do that for Newton Knight or his fellow rebels. The film out Friday might teach you the name Newton Knight (played by a scruffy gaunt and almost feral Matthew McConaughey) but it is far too sprawling and too unfocused to be placed in the canon of forgotten Civil War-era stories alongside ""12 Years a Slave."" This tale follows Newt from his last days in the service to his near-accidental establishment of a rogue state in a swamp as the war rages on all the way to emancipation and reconstruction. If 14 years sounds like a lot of territory to cover it is and the movie takes its time doing so running nearly two and a half hours. And yet it still feels hurried. It begins promisingly enough with the requisite war is hell reminder -- fast-cutting between horrific injuries on the battlefield and then in an overrun makeshift hospital. Newt grudgingly participates mostly by helping the wounded but then something happens that rattles him personally and he heads home to his wife Serena (Keri Russell looking very concerned) and their young child. Things are bleak there too where Confederate soldiers regularly rampage homes and take anything they might need and want -- corn livestock blankets -- for the war effort. Theres also the deplorable ""Twenty Slave Law"" which allows members of the Confederacy to opt out of conscription if they provide 20 slaves. Its a law that benefits only the rich and that is not lost on Newt or his poor friends none of whom own slaves or support the Confederate cause either. Being a deserter Newts mere presence endangers everyone. Serena even packs up the kid and leaves. When they literally send the dogs after him he retreats to the swamp where he meets some runaway slaves and they begin to grow their community. Its here where things get a little murky and rushed. Director Gary Ross (""Seabiscuit"" The Hunger Games"") wants badly to present a lyrical epic and there are some moments of grace but mostly its just labored propelled only by the passage of time pages worth of printed exposition on the screen and the hope that Newts journey is a good enough engine. And yet with all of those years covered Newt is as defined as vapor and his supporting characters even less so. Theres also a jarring cut early on to a trial in 1948 in Mississippi where one of Newts decedents is suspected of having African American ancestry despite looking white. While you get used the back and forth it doesnt ever drum up the suspense of a courtroom drama or achieve its intended poignancy. Newt does in fact take up with Rachel (a powerful if underused Gugu Mbatha-Raw) a former house slave to a plantation owner. The question being asked in 1948 is whether or not they had any kids thus starting a line of mixed race ancestors. Its certainly an interesting thread that this fight could continue so many generations after the war but as with most things here in execution its just more pasta thrown at the wall. Rachel is one of the more compelling characters in the film as is Moses (Mahershala Ali) who we meet with steel claws around his neck and see progress into a true protest leader by the time the war is over when despite emancipation little has changed for the former slaves and actually seems to be getting worse. The Civil War and reconstruction were messy and ""Free State of Jones"" wants to tackle it all. In the end its too much for any one film to handle compellingly with such specificity. ---- ""The Free State of Jones"" a STX Entertainment release is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""brutal battle scenes and disturbing graphic images.""

Photo STX Productions By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com June 23 2016 328 p.m. ET 50 COMMENTS In ""Free State of Jones"" a fiction film all too freely adapted from historical records by its director Gary Ross Matthew McConaughey stars as Newt Knight a fascinating figure on the margins of 19th-century American history. Strong acting often lends authenticity to writing that lacks it and Mr. McConaughey is to be sure an exceptionally strong actor. Yet this screenplay is so arid in its didacticism so pallid in its would-be passion that it defeats his efforts and our involvement however much we may want to cut the film some slack for being about things of consequence--chief among them slavery and racial conflict in the South. More Reviews Hunt for the Wilderpeople Eat That Question Frank Zappa in His Own Words Knight a farmer from Jones County Miss. earned his place in the history books for leading like-minded deserters from the Confederate army in a rebellion against the Confederacy during the Civil War. Their safe haven was a mangrove swamp where they felt invulnerable to attacks by Confederate cavalry. Their motives are still the subject of debate. Were they outlaws? Opportunists? Idealists? In Mr. Rosss recounting antislavery idealism was the driving force. His version paints a vividly idealized picture of principled whites--though with some dissent in their ranks--joining forces with runaway slaves in a sort of rainbow coalition that sets up a secret community where life is mostly harmonious politically purposeful and (a sticking point for literal-minded me) conspicuously hygienic. How I kept wondering could all these fugitives from civilization be so well-scrubbed well-shaved and well-fed not to mention well-spoken and not all that badly dressed? Matthew McConaughey in Free State of Jones Photo STX Films This is well-scrubbed history illustrated by Benoit Delhommes splendid cinematography. Its also clumsy speechifying and sermonizing Mr. McConaugheys purring eloquence notwithstanding. And vague dramatizing. In one example among many a sequence toward the end finds Knight living with two women at the same time--his wife Serena played by Keri Russell who has had almost nothing to do throughout and a slave Rachel (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) whom Knight in fact later married after she had gained her freedom. Yet no relationship between Serena and Rachel has been written or shot. It isnt that theyre hostile to one another. They arent anything to one another. They simply dont have much to say. The clumsiest aspect of the film involves flash-forwards to Mississippi in 1948 where Davis Knight a great-grandson of Newt and Rachel is on trial for miscegenation. Here the script is based on irrefutable and dismaying facts. The trial turned on whether Rachel was black and the defendant was found guilty though the verdict was later overturned. These flash-forwards are clearly meant to remind us how little of the Souths racial torment was changed in the wake of the Civil War. But the information they convey might reasonably--and effectively--have been consigned to title cards at the end. Instead of strengthening the overall storys impact jumping back and forth in time only fragments it and this is not a film with strength to spare. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download Glory (1989) In Edward Zwicks thrilling uplifting epic the Civil War is seen from the Union side--and not just the Union side but the 54th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry the first all-black fighting unit in the Union Army. Matthew Broderick is Robert Gould Shaw the son of abolitionists and the regiments idealistic young colonel. The extraordinary cast includes Denzel Washington as a runaway slave Andre Braugher as a cerebral recruit and Morgan Freeman as a former gravedigger. 28 Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Floating Food Forest Arrives in New York City RNC vs. DNC Sizing Up the Conventions Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillarys One-Candidate Race Opinion A Disunited Partys Successful Convention GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% The Olympic Fantasy Confronts Reality Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Based on true events.CAST Matthew McConaughey Gugu Mbatha-Raw Mahershala AliRATED R (Bloody violence)LENGTH 219BOTTOM LINE Strong work from McConaughey as a charismatic leader but the films meandering historical scope will test your patience. Good intentions become a fatal flaw in ""Free State of Jones"" Gary Ross epic-length biography of a fascinating figure in Southern history. Matthew McConaughey plays Newton Knight a Confederate Army deserter who becomes the charismatic leader of a secessionist territory based on racial equality. ""Free State of Jones"" is an authentic-looking film with strong work from a fine cast but it makes the fatal mistake of trying to broaden its scope to encompass nearly 90 years of race relations in the United States.

Knight is a somewhat murky figure who has been painted as both hero and opportunist but ""Free State of Jones"" -- written by Ross -- chooses to hang a halo over the man. PhotosAmerican Sniper more great war filmsGETTYSBURG amp; MOREBest Civil War moviesSUMMERS MUST-SEE MOVIES25 big movies out this summer Barely a moment goes by when Knight is not rescuing a wounded soldier freeing a chained slave or outwitting white bullies. If we buy this line its thanks largely to McConaughey a natural in the role of a lean flinty principled Southern man. Any film about a ragtag army from ""Braveheart"" to Ross own ""The Hunger Games"" is bound to have its rousing moments and ""Free State of Jones"" has its share. The movies violence can be strong and even a bit overdone with strangulations castrations and imploded faces. Still the movie conveys genuine outrage at the injustices and terrors of the era. That makes the love between Knight and Rachel (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) a house slave seem less like an obligatory romance and more like a triumph. One of the films most harrowing sequences involves the freedman Moses (an Oscar-worthy Mahershala Ali) as he attempts to register blacks to vote. Therein however lies a problem. ""Free State of Jones"" continues past the Civil War through emancipation reconstruction and all the way up to the late 1940s when a light-skinned descendant of Knight (Brian Lee Franklin) runs afoul of entrenched racial laws. advertisement | advertise on newsday That storyline told in flash-forwards wrecks the rhythm of the movie and takes us out of the more compelling Civil War drama. ""Free State of Jones"" wants to show that Knights enemy -- namely racism -- hasnt yet been vanquished. Thats a valid point to make but the result is an overlong and meandering movie. MoviesAmerican Sniper more great war films Four popular Jones charactersWhats in a name?

The films real attraction was the fiery Oscar-nominated performance by Dorothy Dandridge in the title role.TOM JONES (1963) -- Albert Finney earned his first of five Oscar nominations the bawdy hero of Henry Fieldings classic novel set in 18th century England. The movie won four Academy Awards including best picture.RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK (1981) -- Harrison Ford had his tough firmly planted in cheek as adventurer Indiana Jones in this Steven Spielberg blockbuster that served as a big-budget throwback to the movie serials of the 1930s.

Credit Murray Close/STX Entertainment ""Free State of Jones"" begins on the battlefield with a flurry of the kind of immersive combat action that has long been a staple of American movies. The setting is familiar in other ways too. As a line of Confederate troops marches across a field into Union rifle and artillery fire a haze of myth starts to gather over the action a mist of sentiment about the tragedy of the Civil War and the symmetrical valor of the soldiers on both sides of it. But this is a sly piece of misdirection The rest of the movie will be devoted to blowing that fog away using the tools of Hollywood spectacle to restore a measure of clarity to our understanding of the war and its aftermath. Video Movie Review Free State of Jones The Times critic A.O. Scott reviews ""Free State of Jones."" By AINARA TIEFENTHALER and ROBIN LINDSAY on Publish Date June 23 2016. Photo by Murray Close/STX Entertainment. Directed by Gary Ross (""Seabiscuit"") with blunt authority and unusual respect for historical truth ""Free State of Jones"" explores a neglected and fascinating chapter in American history. Mr. Ross consulted some of the leading experts in the era -- including Eric Foner of Columbia University whose ""Reconstruction"" is the definitive study and Martha Hodes of New York University author of a prizewinning study of interracial sexuality in the 19th-century South -- and has done a good job of balancing the factual record with the demands of dramatic storytelling. The result is a riveting visual history lesson whose occasional didacticism is integral to its power.The hero of this tale is Newton Knight a poor farmer from Jones County Miss. who led a guerrilla army of white deserters and escaped slaves against the Confederacy during the war. Afterward he tried to hold this coalition together as a political force in the face of Ku Klux Klan terror. As played by Matthew McConaughey Newton is an ordinary man radicalized by circumstances. His hollow cheeks and wild whiskers suggest a zealous temperament but the kindness in his eyes conveys the decency and compassion that lie at the heart of his moral commitment. Photo Matthew McConaughey leads a group of dissident white farmers and escaped slaves in Gary Rosss ""Free State of Jones."" Credit Murray Close/STX Entertainment Mr. McConaughey is too rugged and ragged to sink into saintliness which is one reason that his righteous characters -- including Ron Woodroof in ""Dallas Buyers Club"" and Mick Haller in ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" -- are sometimes more fun than the movies they inhabit. And while Mr. Rosss story makes Newton unambiguously heroic this is not yet another film about a white savior sacrificing himself on behalf of the darker-skinned oppressed. Nor for that matter is it the story of a white sinner redeemed by the superhuman selflessness of black people. ""Free State of Jones"" is a rarer thing a film that tries to strike sparks of political insight from a well-worn genre template.Its a western of sorts and a romantic rebel movie of sorts -- there are hints of ""Viva Zapata"" and ""Shane"" and a half-dozen other underdog classics -- but with an unusually clear ideological focus. After fleeing the army where he had served as a battlefield nurse and witnessing Confederate authorities confiscating his neighbors livestock and grain Newton takes refuge in a swamp with a small group of slaves who have run away from a nearby plantation including a man named Moses (Mahershala Ali) who becomes his friend and confidant. Through his conversations with Moses and with Rachel (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) a domestic slave who brings the fugitives news and supplies from the plantation house Newton comes to believe that the slaves share a common enemy and a common interest with poor white farmers like himself. Photo Mahershala Ali left and Gugu Mbatha-Raw in ""Free State of Jones."" Credit Murray Close/Stx Entertainment ""Free State of Jones"" is careful not to suggest that the conditions endured by disenfranchised white and enslaved black Mississippians were identical. The system may be rigged against both but in different ways. Especially after the war the alliance proves fragile as white supremacy reasserts itself with renewed brutality. Its persistence is emphasized by a subplot that takes place 85 years after the war in a Mississippi courtroom where Davis Knight (Brian Lee Franklin) a descendant of Newtons is on trial for breaking the states law against interracial marriage. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The question of Daviss racial identity turns on whether he is descended from Rachel or Serena (Keri Russell) Newtons wife at the beginning of the movie. The romance between a white man and an enslaved black woman is to say the least a delicate issue for a movie like this to deal with but Mr. Ross handles this and other fraught matters with impressive tact and sensitivity. The film does not minimize the violence of slavery including the sexual violence that was the daily experience of women like Rachel but it also refrains from turning cruelty into spectacle. Mr. Ross has an old-fashioned faith in the power of editing and in the ability of the audience to imagine what he refrains from showing explicitly. Video Trailer Free State Of Jones A preview of the film. By STX ENTERTAINMENT on Publish Date May 25 2016. Image courtesy of Internet Video Archive. Watch in Times Video >> embed Which is not to say that ""Free State of Jones"" is a subtle movie. Why should it be? There is nothing wrong with a story that has clear heroes and villains especially when such roles have been misconceived for so long. The wily and charismatic Newton Knight is a revisionist archetype a white Southern rebel fighting against the mythology that such figures usually embody. He takes down the Stars and Bars and raises Old Glory above his territory; this movie holds no truck with magnolia-scented nonsense about a genteel Southern way of life menaced by Yankee aggression.It is obvious to Newton and certainly to Moses that the Glorious Cause of the Confederacy was a rapacious and exploitative cotton-based capitalist economy and that the resistance to Reconstruction was intended to restore that system. This view reflects the current scholarly consensus but much of American popular culture like much of American politics remains besotted by the old mythology. Freedom is a long struggle.""Free State of Jones"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Unfortunately for earnest writer-director Gary Ross (The Hunger Games) and anyone watching his epic-length historical drama it lacks everything else needed to escape mediocrity. After a strong beginning Ross clumsy opus soon becomes overwrought under-edited often tedious and utterly devoid of energy. It is also unbelievable on occasion even though it is ""inspired"" by a true story that took place during and after the U.S. Civil War from 1862 to 1876. That story is the remarkable if highly controversial saga of Newton Knight a Mississippi farmer who enlisted in the Confederate Army became disillusioned and embittered deserted started a Unionist movement and led a guerrilla war against Confederate agents and soldiers who preyed on other struggling farmers. Knight was also an abolitionist and eventually remarried this time to Rachel Knight one of his grandfathers former slaves. Enter Reconstruction opportunists and the racist Ku Klux Klan in the wake of the war to force segregation deny voting rights to freemen and institute new forms of enslavement. So there is social racial and political complexity here -- too much of it for any movie to embrace. Meanwhile Ross does not so much discuss the issues as make proclamations and try to ""educate"" us on his revisionist point-of-view. Ross also inserts flash-forward scenes of a 1940s miscegenation trial involving Knights great-grandson to really hammer his ideas home. As for the films final act during Reconstruction it is all awkward docu-drama. Knight is played by Oscar-winning Texan Matthew McConaughey who looks like the real Knight based on an early daguerreotype photograph. But he never really brings a full-blooded human being to life in his performance. British actress Gugu Mbatha-Raw has the same problem at least emotionally. Her character is too poorly written first as a noble victim and then as a stock heroine. Keri Russell does not fare much better while playing Serena who befriends Rachel without so much as a conversation about ""their"" husband. Sorry that is just weird. Ditto for the problems of showing Knights guerrilla army which has its origins in a Mississippi swamp while he is being tended by escaped slaves including Mahershala Alis dynamic character of Moses. Racial tensions rumble but are addressed only superficially. That is just not believable in the context of the times or within the confines of the film. As a result Free State of Jones is a great opportunity lost.

Photo STX Productions LLC MOVIE REVIEW Free State of Jones Running time 139 minutes. Rated R (gory violence). Far be it from me to read political meanings into a Civil War movie but ""Free State of Jones"" is enticingly difficult to chart. Its anti-war anti-plutocracy and anti-racist but its also pro-Bible pro-gun anti-tax and sympathetic to the poor whites who usually get tagged as racist. Its hero is an avowed Republican named Newt. Directed by Gary Ross its a film heaving with ideas that recasts the war along class lines instead of race ones Newton Knight (Matthew McConaughey) a disillusioned Mississippi medic learns that owners of 20 or more slaves have been declared exempt from military service. It dawns on him that poor whites and slaves have both been made to suffer for King Cotton. On pain of execution Newt deserts the Confederate army and hides out in a swamp with escaped slaves while soldiers sniff around the area looking for traitors to hang. Their horses cant penetrate the swamp though and soon scores of ex-soldiers join the cause take up arms and even seize a nearby urban area. They form a secession within the secession dubbing their rebel stronghold the Free State of Jones. Separated from his wife (Keri Russell) Newt finds love with a runaway slave (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) and befriends another Moses (Mahershala Ali) whom he literally frees from his shackles and here the movie strikes the tripwire of todays nutty political correctness sentries Blacks are liberated with the aid of whites and the professional left cant bear that even if the story is true. ""Free State of Jones"" doesnt have the righteous fury that will likely carry the upcoming slave-rebellion film ""The Birth of a Nation"" to Oscar nominations and it glosses over the racial divide between rebellious whites and blacks. Yet its a fascinating thoughtful film willing to confront the tangled aspects of both the war and Reconstruction in a way that recalls ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" which also didnt sentimentalize either side. Improvising crazily to stay alive Newt even tries to form an alliance with Union commander Sherman as the generals ransacking the South but is refused. As bizarre as Newts scheme though many an American will find resonance in his words ""It seems that we aint got no country. I guess were kind of our own country."" Newt has an untamed glory to him and whats more American than that? If McConaugheys performance is a little too jut-jawed and noble the script has plenty of force. Everybody says Newt is ""somebodys n - - - - r"" and a title on-screen reads ""one year after emancipation "" as we watch ex-slaves tilling the same fields as before this time restyled as ""apprentices."" Though Ross finds a 20th-century echo to the story in a courtroom decades later ""Free State of Jones"" doesnt really have an ending. Maybe the history of American race conflict doesnt either.

Share Tweet Free State Of Jones is the type of movie that tends to either win Oscars or become an also-ran punchline due to its failure to win Oscars. Neither distinction is particularly fair; there are enough laments about the sequel-saturated summer movie landscape that the mere existence of a wide-release historical drama targeted at adults counts as some kind of a win awards traction be damned. What it doesnt count for though is a good movie at least not this time.The story is almost interesting enough to fake it. Jones opens on a Civil War battle wherein Newton Knight (Matthew McConaughey) functions primarily as a medic for the Confederates. It becomes clear early on that Newt as hes called is more interested in saving lives on his side than taking lives on the other--and that hes not especially invested in ""sides"" to begin with. He increasingly sees the armed conflict as an attempt by rich Southerners to stay rich (noting that owning a certain number of slaves exempts certain families from the draft) and eventually deserts the Confederates decamping for a community of runaway slaves in the swamps of Mississippi. These outcasts with help from house slave on the inside Rachel (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) rally more poor farmers to their cause. Together they create their own separate ""state"" thats not exactly Union-affiliated but fights the Confederates when push comes to shoot which it often does.On a scene-by-scene basis this works as setup though its a bumpy ride even early going. At first director Gary Ross seems to be making up for eliding some of the more horrific violence in his Hunger Games movie by not flinching away from battlefield carnage here; there are shots of blown-off faces and plenty of shockingly young men meet terrible fates. But if anything the filmmaking here seems less assured than it was on his YA dystopia picture. Some sequences cover McConaughey from an absurd number of angles achieving confusion not from the speed of the editing but the incoherent variety of shots. An early two-man dialogue scene for example utilizes at least four different angles for reasons that are never made clear. When Ross pulls back and sinks into a wide shot he comes across some stark Western-style images. But he only sustains a handful of these moments. More often he cant resist going back in for a close-up and then a close-up from a slightly different vantage. This coverage-heavy restlessness is particularly damaging to Free State Of Jones because it visualizes rather than disguises the storys hodgepodge quality. Ross may not be a great director but he has written some very good screenplays none of which sprawl out like this one. Without a strong narrative flow carrying the movie along Ross feels free to interrupt himself with Civil War photographs onscreen text filling in historical details about the frequent time jumps and most audaciously occasional interludes set in a courtroom 85 years after the events of the movie where a descendant of Newt and Rachel is on trial for participating in an interracial marriage. The fact that many Civil War conflicts continued to fester and flare up in this country for the next century and a half all the way up to our present day does give Free State Of Jones a certain currency. It also creates the uneasy sensation that the movie itself may never end.So it goes on for well over two hours with only McConaughey to anchor it. The resurgent actor is fine in the role mostly avoiding white-savior martyrdom (though there is a scene where he literally removes a black man from bondage something that has somehow not occurred to anyone else in the movie to try). But his performance lacks both the swagger and nuance of his best recent work. Hes placed opposite a lot of other actors but none of them really connect even the talented Mbatha-Raw; Newt and Rachel make the transition to a romantic partnership without so much as a kiss and their most meaningful conversations are conveyed through unresolved fragments. Thanks to the courtroom subplot their relationship becomes more totem than human.Thinly developed characters can still inspire empathy and there are plenty of moments in Jones that successfully boil the blood. The back half of the movie illustrates how the U.S. simply internalized the racial abuse of its pre-Civil War past but its only intermittently successful as actual drama. Instead of building to a crescendo the movie trails off. By the end serious-minded adult moviegoers may find themselves longing for another product from the well-oiled sequel machine.

Comments click to enlarge Free State of Jones Recommended Video Rated R  139 minutes  2016 When the word emancipation turns up in the narrative titles of Free State of Jones a new Civil War drama its enclosed in quotation marks. That skeptical touch is only a sign of our times--growing racial tension in the U.S. stoked by police killings of unarmed black citizens the rollback of voting rights and the ongoing injustice of the drug war have created an appetite for fresh views of American slavery and more critical assessments of its legacy. Steven Spielbergs Lincoln (2012) painted an unvarnished portrait of the president as he pushed the 13th Amendment through Congress and Steve McQueens 12 Years a Slave (2013) shocked people with its frank re-creation of the racist antebellum south. More recently the History Channel unveiled a remake of the 1977 miniseries adapted from Alex Haleys best seller Roots about several generations of a slave family and this fall Fox Searchlight will release Nate Parkers Birth of a Nation which dramatizes the Virginia slave rebellion led by Nat Turner in 1831.

(  / STX Films) Matthew McConaughey seethes with righteous fury in ""Free State of Jones"" a tale based on an intriguing little-known chapter of Civil War history that despite impeccable intentions becomes mired within a poorly structured dubiously focused movie by Gary Ross. Its easy to see why McConaughey embraced the chance to play Newton Knight the scrappy iconoclast at the storys center. A native of Jones County Miss. Knight deserted the Confederate army in 1862 enraged both by conscription policies that favored the wealthy sons of slave-owners and by the marauding bands of rebel soldiers who routinely commandeered his fellow yeoman farmers livestock and supplies. Over the next several years he led a growing band of impoverished deserters and freed slaves who fought against the South from within finally establishing the country-within-a-country of the films title. [Summer Movies Guide Superheroes sequels reboots and much more] Wearing what looks like a set of yellowed prosthetic teeth his face hidden behind stringy hair and a scraggly beard McConaughey delivers a solemn sharp-eyed portrayal of Knight whose character and contradictions one senses cant possibly be contained even in a nearly 2 1/2 hour movie. After returning home to his wife Serena (Keri Russell) and their young son he eventually takes up with an enslaved house servant named Rachel (Gugu Mbatha-Raw). With her he starts another family setting up his swampland community and delivering sermons on self-sufficiency altruism and the immorality of slavery. Meanwhile he becomes a mythic figure in Mississippi where he and his guerilla fighters will in time gain control of three counties. Matthew McConaughey as Newton Knight. (Murray Close/STX Entertainment) McConaughey (Knight) and Gugu Mbatha-Raw (Rachel) star in ""Free State of Jones."" (Courtesy of STX Entertainment) Knight is a captivating figure and Ross makes sure that his ideas -- borne of his primitive Baptist upbringing but of a piece with emerging Marxist theories -- resonate with unmistakable prescience. ""Free State of Jones"" traces Knights crusade all the way into Reconstruction when attempts by African Americans to claim political and social space were met with push-back and terroristic violence that feel depressingly familiar at a time when some of us still need reminding that black lives matter. But its just the sprawling multifaceted nature of Knights story that gets the better of Ross for whom ""Free State of Jones"" has been a passion project for the past decade. Understandably trying to cover as much incident and ideological discourse as he can -- including some ill-advised flashes forward to a 1940s court case involving Knights descendants -- he winds up with an earnest but inert and unwieldy historical drama that in its commendable attempt to rescue a forgotten figure from obscurity too often looks and feels like ""12 Years a Woke Dude."" A former slave named Moses (Mahershala Ali) left and Knight (McConaughey) form an alliance in ""Free State of Jones."" (Murray Close/STX Entertainment) In interviews Ross has insisted that he didnt want ""Free State of Jones"" to become another white savior movie but thats precisely what it is especially during scenes when the murderous injustice of slavery is refracted through Knights frustrated tears. Again this is where Ross who wrote the script from a story by Leonard Hartman might have made an enormous difference with just a slight tweak reframing the narrative to focus more on Knights alliance with a former slave named Moses (a composite character played in a breakout performance by Mahershala Ali) or his relationships with Serena and Rachel which according to the historical record were vexingly complex and grew more so as time wore on. Instead Ross seems intent on presenting Knight as a charismatic visionary cut from the same zealous cloth as John Brown -- an appealing image for a star vehicle but one that seems simplistic and self-congratulatory in a cinematic era defined by ""12 Years a Slave"" and ""Selma"" on the one hand and Nate Parkers upcoming ""The Birth of a Nation"" on the other. Attractively photographed by Benoit Delhomme ""Free State of Jones"" possesses verdant atmospheric beauty and some occasionally striking iconography especially when Knight is rallying the local womenfolk to defend their homes with long rifles and level-eyed aim. And the political critiques embedded within its epochal moment -- when economic racial and sexual oppression converged so violently -- make for fruitful reflection if not always pulse-quickening viewing. As gratifying as it is to see forgotten history brought to light its disappointing too Theres an epic story to be told within ""Free State of Jones"" but this white-knight tale isnt it. R.

Its a film about slavery and Reconstruction set in Mississippi in the 1860s and 1870s -- but a white man is front and center as the hero of the story. When Matthew McConaugheys Newton Knight explains to a bigoted white man that all poor Southerners are essentially the n-word (and he uses the n-word) when he leads two dozen armed singing black men into town in 1875 so they can cast ballots for the first time it smacks of the ""Crusading Caucasian"" syndrome. As author and history professor Kellie Carter Jackson says in an article in the New York Times ""If [the story] is really about Knight being an ally then shouldnt McConaughey be the supporting actor and not the lead?"" Also expect to hear criticism of the films somewhat sanitized depiction of Newton Knight as a charismatic noble superhero of civil rights with speechmaking abilities to rival Lincolns and the unwavering compassion of a saint. (In what might be a first for a historical biopic ""Free State of Jones"" comes with its own heavily annotated website on which director Gary Ross footnotes some 35 scenes and topics of discussion from the movie.) The truth as is almost always the case with fictionalized biopics of historical figures is much more complex. (Update Newtons COMPLETE family history to modern times and Im not sure even the most salacious producer would turn it into a reality show. To say he and his descendants kept it all in the family would be a huge understatement.) It would seem irresponsible to address an important film that focuses on race -- the dominant issue in the history of this nation -- without noting the aforementioned concerns but our primary purpose here is to review the film Gary Ross has made and not the film others might wish he had made. And while ""Free State of Jones"" is indeed a movie about slavery and race with a white man as the leading hero and while it most certainly shall we say ""streamlines"" that mans personal life it is primarily an immensely gripping tale rooted in historical fact and filled with unforgettable images and yes lessons that ring hard and true a century and a half later. As glossy and polished as McConaughey looks in those ubiquitous luxury vehicle ads as ridiculous as he sometimes came across during his ""Shirtless Romantic Comedy Role"" lost years we know he also wont hesitate to strip away all vestiges of vanity when the role calls for it. (The obvious example being his Oscar-winning turn in ""Dallas Buyers Club."") As Newton a farmer turned Confederate medical nurse turned deserter turned leader of a rebellion McConaughey loses himself in a bushy beard mud- and blood-speckled face historically accurate discolored and uneven teeth and a mop of hair drenched in sweat and grime. More important is the work he delivers. Its pure and true -- a raw and honest performance. Even when McConaugheys Newton is clinging tight to a woman he loves or igniting a crowd to action theres never a hint of his famous twinkle or his look-at-how-great-I-am grin or his stoner drawl. We believe this movie star as a swamp-soaked Mississippi outlaw-crusader. ""Free State of Jones"" begins in 1862 with the Civil War in full bloody bore. (Ross camera doesnt shy away from excruciating close-ups of spilled innards severed limbs and faces turned into horror shows by gaping wounds.) Already steaming about a new law exempting Confederate sons from military service depending on the number of slaves the family owns (for every 20 slaves another son is sent home) Newton reaches the breaking point when his beloved young nephew lasts but a few hours in combat before a Union sniper takes the boy out. Newton is taking his kin home. Its as simple as that for him. Of course thats also known as desertion and once Newton is back on his home turf in Mississippi its a matter of time before Confederate soldiers are hunting him down with the same dogs they use to track runaway slaves. Wanted for treason and depending on the kindness (and yes the sometimes nearly magical powers) of sympathetic slaves Newton holes up deep in the bayou with a small band of runaways including Moses (Mahershala Ali) who retains his dignity and resolve even with a heavy spiked metal collar still bolted to his neck. Writer-director Ross provides helpful subtitles and historical updates as the story progresses. (Occasionally we jump ahead some 65 years for a trial involving one of Newtons descendants.) Newtons wife Serena (Keri Russell) is out of the picture having fled to Georgia with their infant son. As Newtons company of runaway slaves and Confederate deserters grows to 100 then 200 and more he finds love with Rachel (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) who somehow manages to make her way to the bayou with food and other provisions on a regular basis even though shes still the property of the evil plantation owner James Eakins (Joe Chrest). Week by week month by month Newton and his ragtag band outwit and outgun the Confederates taking over a considerable portion of southeast Mississippi. (Newton declares his home county ""The Free State of Jones."") At times the speechifying in ""Free State"" stretches credulity. Is it possible Newton was even remotely this articulate? And even though its true Newtons wife and son returned to Mississippi and wound up living on the same property with Newton and Rachel a scene where Serena and Rachel share a moment on the front porch comes across as highly idealized. The terrific character actor Thomas Francis Murphy (""12 Years a Slave"" ""Focus"" ""Self/Less"") brings a Donald Sutherland-esque casually slithery villainous touch to the role of the Confederate commander who counters Newtons rebellion by hanging children and burning down farms. Alis portrayal of Moses is strong and memorable. Mbatha-Raw gives a wonderful performance as the strongest female character and the true heart of the story. This is no history lesson but its mainstream Hollywood entertainment that respects the history and seems to invite discussion and debate. 1/2 STX Entertainment presents a film written and directed by Gary Ross. Running time 139 minutes. Rated R (for brutal battle scenes and disturbing graphic images). Opens Friday at local theaters.

STX Entertainment photo Matthew McConaughey in ""Free State of Jones."" STX Entertainment photo Newton Knight (Matthew McConaughey) is a Confederate medic whos had enough of the carnage and supports neither slavery nor the secessionist agenda of the South. So when the opportunity presents itself he turns deserter. Knights not the kind to dodge a fight but it has to be for something he believes in.Returning to his farm in Mississippi he discovers that Confederate soldiers are stealing from his neighbors and burning down the homes of anyone who objects. Resistance is called for and Knight is just the man to organize it.In a nearby swamp he gathers a band of rebels including renegade slave Moses Washington (Mahershala Ali). Knight also makes the acquaintance of Rachel (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) a house slave who collaborates with the rebels on the sly. Knight proves to be a true leader adept at rallying his followers through appeals to their common humanity. Its not long before his rebel band -- in which blacks and whites and men and women fight side by side -- has become a significant threat to Confederate forces.But thats not the whole story. In flash-forwards one of Knights descendants is taken to court in the 1940s on charges of miscegenation. ""Free State of Jones"" aspires to greatness but fumbles badly. In the early going writer-director Gary Ross (""Seabiscuit"") is on solid ground capturing the enormity of the challenge facing Knight and his army. But the film promises an epic confrontation that never happens and meanders through a series of episodes with little narrative momentum before ending abruptly and unsatisfyingly. McConaughey who won an Oscar for ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is quite persuasive as a man thrust into the role of messiah. But the film is more of an educational than an emotional experience.Indeed ""Free State of Jones"" demonstrates just how wrong the Academy Award-winning and far superior ""12 Years a Slave"" could have gone.What ""Free State of Jones""  21/2 stars out of four  Run time 219  Rating R  Content Brutal battle scenes and disturbing graphic images Calvin Wilson  314-340-8346calvinwilsonstl on Twittercalvinwilsonpost-dispatch.com Tags Free State Of Jones Calvin Wilson Matthew Mcconaughey Knight Slave Calvin Wilson Calvin Wilson is an arts writer for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

Matthew McConaughey and Gugu Mbatha-Raw star. Gary Ross film about a southern farmer who leads a revolt against the Confederacy could have been intriguing. Instead its one-note.Matthew McConaughey and Jacob Lowland star in ""Free State of Jones.""(Photo STX Productions)Story HighlightsCritics rating 2.5 out of 5 stars""Free State of Jones"" is a well-intentioned slog through a potentially fascinating bit of Civil War history brought to life only by Matthew McConaugheys performance and then only occasionally.Note Its two hours and 19 minutes long so make that a long slog.RELATED 4 questions with Matthew McConaugheyGary Ross whose resume includes ""Seabiscuit"" and the first ""Hunger Games"" movie tells the story of Newton Knight a farmer who served as a nurse on the Confederate side during the war but who we learn from the start harbored no illusions as to any sort of glory of the cause. Already cynical about making the rich richer (the true cause of war he figures) he becomes incensed when he learns of a new Confederate mandate that allows the first son in a household to be exempt from fighting if the family owns at least 20 slaves. When he takes the body of a relative home and sees Confederate soldiers looting their own peoples farms (part of a ""tax"" that is routinely abused) hes had enough. He stands up to the soldiers virtually ensuring he will be hanged as a deserter.Matthew McConaughey stars in ""Free State of Jones."" (Photo STX Productions)Instead he flees for the swamps of Mississippi leaving his wife (Keri Russell little seen) and young son behind. There he and a group of runaway slaves and later other soldiers who have deserted take the fight to the Confederate soldiers who have been stealing food and goods from other Southerners. They arent exactly fighting for the Union Knight explains. Its just that they and the Union are fighting the same people.AZCENTRALThings To Do app Get the best in events dining and travel right on your deviceThe political and societal implications of that fight are intriguing. But rather than explore it in depth Ross goes another route -- that of making Knight a hero one so selfless so enlightened so righteous that you wonder why he didnt just fit him for a halo and be done with it. (Knight has an opposite number a Confederate lieutenant played by Bill Tangradi who is just as one-dimensional on the evil side. There is not a lot of subtlety to this story.)The harmony in Knights regiment which includes men and women make it more like a commune. With the exception of one bad apple everyone loves everyone -- evidently including Knight who fathers a child with Rachel (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) a former slave. When the war is over and Knight is reunited with his wife and child he sets them up in a guest house and lives with Rachel -- and the two women raise the new baby as one big happy family.Matthew McConaughey and Bill Tangradi star in ""Free State of Jones."" (Photo STX Productions)Ross jumps back and forth to 1948 to show the trial of one of Knights descendants who has been arrested in Mississippi for marrying a White woman; though he looks White prosecutors have researched the family tree and believe hes a descendant of Rachel as well. The penalty -- in the 20th century remember -- was imprisonment.MORE AZCENTRAL ON SOCIAL Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | PinterestIts an attempt to show that the racial divide didnt end with the Civil War but the story already does that. When the war ends while slaves are now ostensibly free the south comes up with insidious ways to keep them all but enslaved (""apprenticeships"" are particularly ugly). Knight of course continues to fight the good fight.Matthew McConaughey and Gugu Mbatha-Raw star in ""Free State of Jones."" (Photo STX Productions)To his credit McConaughey invests Knight with an intensity that guides his devotion to the cause even as the cause evolves. The romcom days behind him the actor continues to sink his teeth into dramatic roles with gusto even if the roles are weakly written.As a whole ""Free State of Jones"" would have benefitted from more nuanced storytelling. Instead its a flat reading of a story you know has more depth leaving you intrigued but ultimately unsatisfied.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Area theaters. Matthew McConaughey sheds any and all trace of Hollywood glamor for ""Free State of Jones"" based on a bloody but little known slice of Civil War history. Buried beneath a scraggly beard and sporting a mouthful of mangy molars he plays Newton Knight a Mississippi farmer and Confederate army deserter who led a rebellion against greedy Confederate forces with a ragtag band of white rebels and runaway slaves in 1863. Its a meaty role. McConaughey is front and center almost every minute -- all 139 (oh brother) of them. If the ""Dallas Buyers Club"" Oscar winner was simply seeking a role that gave him scads of screen time he chose well. But if he was also looking for a project that rose above being earnest but unexceptional the choice wasnt so alright alright alright. Free State of Jones actress has spiritual moment at slave grave The film gets loses its firm grip a third of the way in. Too bad since the film directed and co-written by Gary Ross (""The Hunger Games"" ""Seabiscuit"") gets off to a bang-up beginning. Matthew McConaughey and Gugu Mbatha-Raw aim for a life together in ""Free State of Jones."" (Courtesy of STX Entertainment) Gritty -- and gory -- combat scenes summon edge-of-your-seat intensity. Theyre so good that the bulk of the movie -- set amid Reconstruction and roiling with racial hatred and violence -- comes off slack and and predictable. Performances offer some compensation. McConaugheys star turn is straight-up and persuasive. Gugu Mbatha-Raw is earthy and believable as Rachel the slave Knight falls for and has a child with. Mahershala Ali brings depth and dignity as escaped slave Moses. The always fine Keri Russell has little to do as Knights wife. An awkward subplot designed to show the decades-leaping and merciless reach of racism pads out an already overlong movie.

(Courtesy of STX Entertainment) Movie review of ""Free State of Jones"" Matthew McConaughey plays a Confederate deserter who joined African Americans in a Civil War rebellion and later during Reconstruction. Rating 2.5 stars out of 4. Share story By John HartlSpecial to The Seattle Times Like the 1989 Civil War drama ""Glory"" writer-director Gary Ross ""Free State of Jones"" is based on a rarely dramatized aspect of the War Between the States. Unfortunately its so ambitious that its constantly straining to find a focus. Whereas ""Glory"" told one story well ""Free State"" cant settle down and concentrate. The effect is sometimes exhilarating but covering several decades of Southern history turns out to be an energy drain. Only one memorable character emerges Matthew McConaugheys Newton Knight a Mississippi farmer who deserted the Confederacy and ended up joining African Americans in a rebellion that ultimately included Reconstruction. Movie Review 1/2   Free State of Jones with Matthew McConaughey Keri Russell Gugu Mbatha-Raw Sean Bridgers. Written and directed by Gary Ross based on a book by Victoria E. Bynum. 139 minutes. Rated R for brutal battle scenes and disturbing graphic images. Several theaters. Ross relies heavily on his charismatic star to carry Knights story without making Knight appear to be the centerpiece. But its a struggle particularly when the filmmakers dont demonstrate much interest in the fact that he apparently had two live-in wives.

Critics regarded it as a dim rip-off of 1939s ""Gone With the Wind""; its based on a 1942 novel. Ross film is based on Victoria E. Bynums 2001 book ""The Free State of Jones."" They both lean toward a nonfiction approach though Ross follows narrative tradition by blending real characters and creating new ones that are more symbolic than historical. The director of ""Pleasantville"" and the first ""Hunger Games"" Ross stages the battle scenes efficiently. But few of the many death scenes have much emotional weight.

"Free State of Jones review Matthew McConaughey shows his skills in frustrating Civil War drama - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Free State of Jones review Matthew McConaughey shows his skills in frustrating Civil War drama Free State of Jones Trailer Free State of Jones Trailer (YouTube) Free State of Jones Trailer (YouTube) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune In so many Civil War-era photographs a bone-weariness of spirit coupled with a kind of faraway intensity lurks in the soldiers eyes. Plenty of actors can fake that sort of thing but Matthew McConaughey really does have it. He looks right and convincing in a period drama such as ""Free State of Jones"" the historical biography equal parts intrigue and frustration written and directed by Gary Ross.McConaughey plays Newton Knight like Oskar Schindler an anomaly in a horrific time and place. Knight a pro-Union Mississippi native marshaled a guerrilla war against his own side the Confederates with troops (as many as 500) including deserters and runaway slaves alike. In modern-day Mississippi -- theres a fine March 2016 Smithsonian feature about Knights complicated legacy -- this ""Southern Yankee"" remains a hugely divisive figure. Free State of Jones STX Entertainment Matthew McConaughey left and Jacob Lofland in ""Free State of Jones."" Matthew McConaughey left and Jacob Lofland in ""Free State of Jones."" (STX Entertainment) He fathered five children in his common-law marriage to a former slave and nine more with his wife. Both families shared the same 160-acre farm. Progressive hero or backwoods disgrace? The arguments according to the Smithsonian piece and half-dozen books on Knights life continue to this day. Even if you carve Knights rich personal life out of a cinematic retelling (which would be pretty stupid) youd still have a rebel who in 1864 managed to prevail over the Confederates in Jones County Miss. and declare the county the Free State of Jones. That is highly promising movie material albeit squarely in the White Savior division of racially conscious historical biopics (i.e. the easiest to bankroll in Hollywoods eyes).MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR As the film begins Knight scrambles across battlefields as a Confederate medic; soon his eyes are fully opened to the wars costs and the way it grinds through white and black lives. Ross script the unwieldy result of what appears to have been a rabbit hole of historical research deftly sets up Knights moral awakening. In an early scene a nephew of Knights is killed on the battlefield just before he deserts. Soon Knight himself turns his back on the war and his guns against it.In another early scene Knight breaks the terrifying neck-shackle loose from the formerly enslaved Moses Washington (Mahershala Ali). In the Reconstruction-era sequences ""Free State of Jones"" turns much of its attention to Moses and his efforts to register voters among newly freed slaves. Knights own postwar activities are rather hastily covered and you can tell Ross ran into some trouble working everything in judging by how often he relies on expository title cards placed on top of gorgeous black-and-white period photographs.These have a way of tossing us out of the story. So do the flash-forwards to 1948 where Knights great-grandson Davis Knight is on trial for miscegenation versus the state of Mississippi. The leaps ahead are meant to illuminate how things have changed and how they havent but the interpolations feel uncertain.With extreme tact ""Free State of Jones"" establishes the domestic mosaic of Knights domestic lives. Gugu Mbatha-Raw portrays the slave-turned-common-law wife Rachel; Keri Russell has a couple of scenes as Knights first wife Serena and at one point Serena calms Rachels newborn and the women share a ""isnt this nutty?"" laugh that hints at everything Ross cant make time for in a 139-minute movie. Hes a filmmaker (he did well with the first ""Hunger Games"" among others) of considerable taste but often in ""Free State of Jones"" we feel like visitors to a historical re-enactment site. From camera composition to production design everything looks and feels fresh-scrubbed and somewhat staid and you dont quite believe what youre seeing. I certainly felt that way during utopian Piney Woods military camp scenes where Knights men and women white and black share a common cause and theres always a fiddle or a harmonica accompanying the pig roast. At such times the movie threatens to turn its protagonist into a male version of Katniss Everdeen glamorous indominable leader of the rebellion. McConaughey is too wily and skillful an actor to falsify his end of the bargain. Ross smooth steady film is just interesting enough to make you wish it were a lot grittier and better.Michael Phillips is a Tribune Newspapers critic.mjphillipstribpub.comTwitter phillipstribune ""Free State of Jones"" -- 2.5 starsMPAA rating R (for brutal battle scenes and disturbing graphic images)Running time 2 hours 19 minutesOpens Thursday eveningRELATED STORIESHow Independence Day Armageddon and others bred the schlockbusterThe Neon Demon review Elle Fanning strikes a pose in dull horror flickThe Wailing review Deafening evil from South Korean director Na Hong-jin Caption Trailer Bad Moms Watch the trailer for ""Bad Moms.""

By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 712am on Thursday Jun. 23 2016 Thursday Jun. 23 2016 Thursday Jun. 23 2016 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Theres an intriguing if not widely known series of events at the center of the Civil War movie Free State of Jones. Its one of those wartime curiosities that slips through the pages of American history becoming a mere asterisk amid a larger story of battles won and lost.In 1862 white Mississippian Newton Knight deserted the Confederate Army after becoming disillusioned with its cause and outraged at how struggling non-slave-owning white farmers were having their possessions plundered by the Confederacy to help feed and support the soldiers at the front.But instead of just fleeing the South he recruited other deserters and allied with runaway slaves whod been living deep in the swamps declared war against the Confederacy and invented his own state -- called Jones as he was from Jones County -- and enjoyed success in routing his far more powerful adversaries. Through it all he fell in love with a black woman Rachel.Thats a movie that writes itself. Unfortunately the movie that director/co-writer Gary Ross ( The Hunger Games Seabiscuit) has written is well-made but struggles to be an all-encompassing nearly 2 1/2-hour epic that gets mired in historical detail. The last third of the film as it stuffs more and more in feels less like a movie and more like cramming for a history exam at 2 a.m.Matthew McConaughey brings the right amount of both indignation and weariness to the role of Newton Knight and the rest of the cast -- including Gugu Mbatha-Raw ( Belle) as Rachel and Mahershala Ali ( House of Cards) as his brother in arms Moses -- is quite strong as well. The problem rests with how Ross and co-writer Leonard Hartman shape the narrative.Instead of just focusing on Knights guerrilla war against the Confederacy and how the blacks and whites in his ""army"" put aside their anger and suspicion for a larger goal Free State of Jones stretches into the post-war Reconstruction era and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan. It even flashes forward 85 years to a court case involving one of Knights descendants. It makes for a fractured frustrating film that squanders its potential.At one point as more Confederate deserters are joining Knights cause and everyone is drunk on the possibility of victory theres a party with the requisite roast pig. When Moses tries to get some hes yelled at by one of the soldiers for not knowing his place.Its the only moment in Free State of Jones that hints at what it must have been like in that dank swamp for these two groups trying to live and survive together. Also because this is Knights story theres little exploration of the mixed emotions the former slaves might have had about his ambitions.Knight remains a controversial polarizing figure in some quarters and there have been many books published about his fascinating life and times. Its too bad that the film that is going to introduce him to a wider audience isnt half as compelling as his real story must have been.

Photo Murray Close Associated Press Jones an ambitious powerful Civil War story 1 / 5 Back to Gallery Matthew McConaughey looks like a Confederate soldier. He has the cold eyes and the steady gaze you find staring out from old daguerreotypes and in ""Free State of Jones"" he also has the slicked-back unwashed hair and the aura of a man whos from the 19th century and proud of it. He looks young and yet older than time older than anybody is today. The film directed and co-written by Gary Ross tells the little-known story of Newton Knight a soldier who deserted the Confederate army and then led an insurrection against it. With a makeshift band of escaped slaves and disgruntled farmers he held several counties in Mississippi against Confederate forces and survived the war. He created his own free state based on the idea that ""every man is a man"" and that ""no man ought to stay poor so another man can get rich."" ""Free State of Jones"" is an extraordinarily ambitious film and for that reason its not perfect. Through Knights story it attempts to tell the true history of Reconstruction and at times -- despite the movies 139-minute length -- events seem rushed. Nonetheless until something better comes along this is the movies most comprehensive and honest portrait of a pivotal and misunderstood period of American history. So its a good film absorbing from beginning to end but its also important. A generation ago it could not have been made. It is very much the product of changing attitudes about the Civil War and several decades worth of scholarly research into Reconstruction. Its an expression of our era as well in that it blends two strains in our current political discourse multiculturalism and angry populism. Knight is a witness to carnage as the movie begins working as a nurse in the Confederate army. Like a lot of soldiers at the time he sees the conflict as ""a rich mans war and a poor mans fight."" Circumstances lead him to desertion and he comes home to Jones County Mississippi to find his own people struggling. Poor farmers are having their corn and their livestock confiscated by the army. Theyre being left to starve while the wealthy landowners who started the war are not only staying rich but avoiding service. At his best McConaughey has always been a little bit strange as if listening to music that no one else hears and that quality serves him well in ""Free State of Jones."" As played by McConaughey Knight has two traits that are much rarer than they should be the ability to see whats going on and the courage to admit it. So Knight isnt bound by false concepts of honor; and hes not a racist even though he lives in a racist world. Neither a liberal nor a philosopher hes just a naturally fair-minded person. Soon his effort to escape the hangman throws him right into the company of escaped slaves who live in the swamp where the army cant bring its horses. The swamp is a magical place where rowboats seem to float on leaves of grass. Ross captures that hint of enchantment while staying true to the era. So teeth are dingy clothes are old and the women dont wear makeup. Beyond that Ross has a feel for how people talked and thought as when Keri Russell as Knights first wife says ""The rebs burned my first farm. Sherman burned my second. At least they agree on that."" Thats it the rueful humor of country folk and the sound of the 19th century the voice of people who wont be beaten. Even as it looks back ""Free State of Jones"" also looks out to the promise of a new America as when Knight and his second wife Rachel -- a former slave played with alert sensitivity by Gugu Mbatha-Raw -- look at their newborn child. They cant decide if the baby looks black or white; and then Rachel tells her son ""Youre just a brand-new thing arent you?"" She says it simply but we feel the impact. This is the United States. This is what it has always been about -- people coming together from all conditions and situations and locations to make things that are new and beautiful and that change the world. Ross distills it all into that moment. It can give you goose bumps. The movie tries to distill a lot more than that the hope that followed the end of the war the disappointing aftermath the second wave of hope that followed the enfranchisement of black men the rise of the Ku Klux Klan and even the short-sightedness of Abraham Lincolns successor Andrew Johnson. Thats a lot to stuff into 139 minutes but its almost a compliment to say that a movie that long should have been longer. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Griffiths notorious Civil War epic Birth of a Nation as ""writing history with lightning."" Gary Rosss Free State of Jones which covers roughly the same period as Griffiths film is more like writing history with index cards. Diligent and informative but also fragmented and inert it plays like a series of scenes and notes for a longer more fleshed-out movie.Its easy to see the appeal of the story though. In 1863 a poor Mississippi farmer named Newton Knight (Matthew McConaughey) led a rebellion of deserters and escaped slaves against the Confederacy waging guerrilla warfare from the swamps and eventually declaring their county the ""Free State of Jones."" After the war Knight moved away from white society with his new wife a war ally and former slave named Rachel (Gugu Mbatha-Raw). He also tried to help with the Reconstruction effort but soon saw that the old racist laws were simply being replaced by new racist laws. The real-life Knight lived well into the twentieth century; he died in 1922 having fathered fourteen children. (Some of these were kids from his previous marriage to a white woman Serena played here by Keri Russell. In what may be a sop to contemporary mores the film shows her with only one child.)Film Details Free State of Jones RatingR GenreAction/Adventure Running Time139 min. More Info Trailer On its surface Free State of Jones seems like yet another story of a Great White Savior -- a tale to salve stir and reassure liberal hearts. That said its a fascinating piece of history and its to the filmmakers credit that they dont falsely portray Knight as a warrior for racial justice straight out of the gate -- we watch his consciousness develop. This was a man enraged at first not at the racial politics of the South but by its class inequities. (By most accounts this is also factually accurate Most of the residents of Jones County were much too poor to own slaves and thus suspicious of the Confederacy.)When we meet Newt hes serving as a reluctant nurse in the Confederate army in 1862 deep in the gore and horror of the battlefield. Hes suspicious of the war (""Im tired of helping them fight for their cotton"" he rails to his comrades amid protestations that the war is really about ""honor"") but he winds up deserting almost by accident as he tries to save his fresh-faced nephew Daniel (Jacob Lofland) from the savagery of combat. Upon returning home Newt discovers that Confederate soldiers have raided his and other families lands seizing grain and hogs and corn condemning them to starvation. Meanwhile a recently passed ""Twenty Negro Law"" deeming that anyone who owns twenty slaves can avoid military service confirms to Newt and his neighbors that this is a case of ""a poor mans fighting a rich mans war"" Hard-luck farmers are dying to maintain an institution that only benefits rich plantation owners.After a run-in with the hounds of the local military police Newt finds himself hiding out in the woods with a band of escaped slaves secretly ministered to by Rachel whos still in the service of her abusive white master. Among the runaways is Moses (Mahershala Ali) who jokes of a dog that bit Newt ""You must taste like we do the way it latched onto you."" Slowly as others find their way to it the group becomes self-sufficient out there in the swamps; after the Southern defeat at Vicksburg their ranks swell seemingly overnight.Ross is a director whose career has encompassed both soft-focus Oscar bait and franchise fare. But as he proved with the first Hunger Games hes better with action movies than he is with prestige pictures. (Some will disagree Seabiscuit and Pleasantville for all their musty reverence were critical and awards-season successes.) Early on in Free State of Jones as the story remains grounded in Newts experiences of combat and the urgency of his desertion and initial rebellion were immersed in this world. McConaugheys wide eyes and tense gestures convey a compelling mixture of bewilderment and fear.But as events accelerate -- as the Confederacy is defeated and Reconstruction begins accompanied by the violent rise of the Ku Klux Klan and the eventual passage of the Fifteenth Amendment -- Ross loses the thread. The movie is gradually overwhelmed by onscreen title cards doling out historical context along with the occasional informative and/or inspirational speech. I applaud the directors thoroughness -- he doesnt want this to be another Hollywoodized bulldozing of complexity and veracity. But I would have gladly given up all those onscreen facts for made-up scenes of Knight and his brethren interacting with one another demonstrating what this rebellion and freedom meant for them.The clutter doesnt end there. Ross often cuts to a 1948 court case when Newt and Rachels great-grandson was convicted under Mississippis miscegenation laws for marrying a white woman. Thats also an interesting story but its doled out in flashes -- grace notes really -- so that these characters too are denied their agency and individuality becoming momentary pawns in the films attempt to illustrate a historical process instead of a human fact. Its a bold move narratively demonstrating that the past is never really past. But if so why choose the 1940s? Why not show history in dialogue with today? Ross does throw in an occasional shot or moment that suggests what Free State of Jones had the potential to be a group of mothers calmly walking to cut down the bodies of their hanged sons; a quiet exchange right after the war when Rachel now finally able to live with Knight admires the feather bed shell sleep in for the first time in her life. And even as the film loses McConaugheys physicality relegating him to speeches and canned bursts of righteous anger Mbatha-Raw and Ali manage some scenes of real tenderness; too bad we dont see more of them.Nevertheless Rosss failure is a noble one He seems obsessed with this story and wants to tell the whole thing. But he doesnt have the time or narrative juice. He forsakes the dramatic imagination required to make history come alive -- to find the subtlety the intimacy and lived-in experience that will humanize the struggle and the pageantry. Instead we get mere fragments and shadows of the film Free State of Jones could have been.Free State of Jones Directed by Gary Ross STX Entertainment Opens June 24 Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Bilge Ebiri Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film and TV Film Reviews Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

C Free State of Jones Genre Historical Drama; Starring Matthew McConaughey Gugu Mbatha-Raw; Director Gary Ross (Director); Release Date 06/24/2016; Runtime (in minutes) 139; MPAA Rating R Posted June 21 2016 -- 1214 PM EDT See also WATCH McConaughey empowers the people in Free State of Jones clip Matthew McConaughey leads resistance in Free State of Jones trailer Matthew McConaugheys mouth is full of craggy teeth and speechy dialogue as Civil War mutineer Newton Knight in this drippy vanilla way-too-long history lesson. Knight was a Mississippi farmer who led a rebellion against the Confederacy backed by a small army of yeomen and escaped slaves and later helped fight injustice during Reconstruction. His messianic status is debated among historians but the Jesus beard that McConaughey wears is historically accurate. So is the fact that Knight had children with a black woman (played by Gugu Mbatha-Raw) even if the subject is handled with such History Channel good taste. As Knights wife The Americans great Keri Russell has never been so misused. Free State of Jones is the least idiosyncratic film by Gary Ross (Pleasantville Seabiscuit The Hunger Games) whose askew view of the world is fogged by  period-piece banalities worst of all in easy-to-hate villains and Knights ex-slave sidekick named Moses (Mahershala Ali). Unlike 12 Years a Slave which never flinched inside its antebellum horror house the movie lacks brio. Ross wants to shake up the format--notably with a few scenes set 85 years after the war--but like so many directors who have tackled historical social issues before him he confuses noble cornball sermonizing for art.

TWITTER 6/24/2016 Matthew McConaughey stars as Newton Knight the Mississippi farmer who led a rebellion against the Confederacy from the inside with the help of renegade slaves. A compelling and little-known story of the Civil War period is studiously reduced to a dry and cautious history lesson in Free State of Jones. As if afraid to offend anyone or put a wrong foot in an era of racial hypersensitivity writer-director Gary Ross tiptoes as if through a minefield in relating the fascinating tale of Newton Knight a Mississippi farmer who had the temerity to lead a rebellion against the Confederacy from the inside with the help of a growing number of renegade slaves. Serious and upfront films about slavery have been scarce enough through the decades that its notable to have at least two of them in 2016 this one and Nate Parkers impactful but also problematic Sundance winner The Birth of a Nation set for release on Oct. 7 and bound to be the bigger audience-pleaser. Returning to action four years after making the first Hunger Games installment Ross opens well with sobering scenes of Civil War carnage as Confederate troops are systematically mowed down while being marched directly into Union lines of fire. Ross underlines the butchery with dialogue footnotes about Dixies class divide as the poor do the fighting on behalf of rich landowners who are exempt from military service if they own at least 20 slaves. There could scarcely be a more sympathetic member of the Confederacy than Newton Knight (Matthew McConaughey) a medic whos both anti-secession and anti-slavery; hes a reb by geographic happenstance alone. The quick death of a youngster hes taken under his wing is the last straw for the aging farmboy who deserts and back home tries to protect his wife Serena (Keri Russell) from the illegal confiscation of most of their possessions; she soon sees no choice but to flee. More provocations send Newt fleeing to an impenetrable swamp where in league with a small band of escaped slaves he begins his career as a maverick marauder against his increasingly beleaguered Southern brethren. In its sober and considered way the film is absorbing at first even for those with more than a passing knowledge of the war. Americans fighting Americans delivers a sharp sting and Ross succeeds in establishing a thoughtful non-sensationalistic tone as he lays the foundations for Newts unintended career as a leader of disenfranchised men. Twenty-five minutes in the focus abruptly shifts to a courthouse scene in the late 1940s in which a Caucasian-looking man is seemingly being accused of being part-black and therefore vulnerable to charges of miscegenation. Some sort of related link to the Civil War story is clearly in the offing. In a gradual Seven Samurai-like manner Newt builds a belief in his hitherto subservient and downcast new allies that they can strike back against their longtime tormentors. ""Nobody done nothin like that for them before"" remarks Rachel (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) a house slave at a nearby plantation who ends up doing many favors for the renegades and eventually becomes Newts common-law wife. The first order of business is getting a dreadful iron necklace with upward-pointing spears removed from Moses (Mahershala Ali) the clear leader among the ""collective."" The second is for Newt to teach them all how to shoot; they learn very quickly. But just as the film seems like its about to really click into a higher gear it loses momentum midstream and ultimately becomes didactic in its time-jumping final act. There is much incident Families are shattered innocents are hanged farms and churches are burned and the hell that is war and the fundamental unfairness of life are on abundant display. Still Ross is more attentive to what is historically known of Newt Knight and his times than to the imperatives of good drama; the veteran screenwriter has neglected to write any interesting or emotional scenes between Newt and Rachel dialogue is devoted far more to issues than to quotidian banter and the Reconstruction-era scenes jump from one increasingly negative historical moment to the next. The Ku Klux Klan is born plantations are restored to their former owners apprenticeship becomes a euphemism for slavery voting rights for blacks are squelched and ""emancipation"" is a term that must be enclosed within qualifying quotation marks. As the characters recede the final stretch becomes a checklist of setbacks for racial fairness and equality a build-up that concludes with a consequent outrage in the resolution of the 1940s court case. Well before its over then Free State of Jones (which never really does satisfactorily address the issue of the three relevant Mississippi counties ever having been declared a ""state"") has devolved from an engaging historical drama into a compendium of regressive racial developments. Despite endowing Newt with a right-amiable manner and an easy way with speechifying McConaughey doesnt get the opportunity to create a fully dimensional man -- hes given precious few intimate moments and no flashes of self-doubt. Ali is charismatic and his characters arc is the most eventful and tragic but Mbatha-Raw is given little opportunity to flash the talent shes suggested previously. Shot entirely in Louisiana the film benefits from its lush rural locations and the lived-and-died-in look of its sets and costumes.

A sober overly studious account of one of the wars strangest most extraordinary campaigns -- that of Mississippi deserter Newton Knight (Matthew McConaughey) leading an armed anti-Confederate rebellion of white farmers and runaway slaves -- ""Free State of Jones"" doesnt neatly fit into Hollywoods track record of boldly emotional war sagas or queasy white-centralized versions of the black experience. See Video Matthew McConaughey Leads Rebellion Against Confederacy in Free State of Jones Trailer The real story which Ross valued enough that he annotated his movie with notes onscreen and a fully-sourced companion website is certainly complex enough to defy categorization. But the movie also doesnt entirely escape an arid educational quality coming off mostly as a curious hybrid of the best and the regrettable in right-side-of-history cinema. We meet Newton Knight on the battlefield as a Confederate Army medic tending to wounded soldiers and railing against a war he not only disavows morally but also sees as a rich mans battle fought by poor folk like himself. After witnessing his terrified nephew (Jacob Lofland ""Mud"") shot and failing to save him Newt becomes a deserter returning to his wife Serena (Keri Russell) and child only to learn that Confederate cavalry and tax agents routinely commandeer his struggling neighbors harvests livestock and provisions for the war effort. Also Read Matthew McConaughey Looks Exactly Like His Real-Lilfe Free State of Jones Character Following an armed standoff against a snarling lieutenant (Bill Tangradi ""Argo"") Newt officially becomes a wanted man fleeing into the swamps with the help of a kind sweet plantation servant named Rachel (the ever-appealing Gugu Mbatha-Raw ""Belle"") who first caught Newts eye when she once tended to his sick boy. There in a tiny camp of Maroons he meets Moses (Mahershala Ali) an escaped slave still shackled to a hideous crook-pronged neck collar and the pair form a bond. Soon with caches of smuggled-in rifles and a growing influx of local deserters fed up with the Confederacy appropriating their property and conscripting their kin Newt becomes a de facto Southern Unionist leader to this ragtag mixed-race outfit committed to raiding plantations re-seizing stolen crops and fighting all who dare to end their rebellion. At the captured town of Ellisville their hundreds-strong group declares themselves a free state with Newt announcing that one of their key principles is ""every mans a man."" Judging by a surviving photo of the real Newton Knight shown at the end McConaugheys just the kind of wild-eyed force to bring his zealotry to life. The go-to star for Southern gadflies is mostly in control of his sometimes infuriating in-the-moment vibe believably depicting a good simple man drawn to a cause hes making up as he goes along. But Ross doesnt always make Newts heroic motivations clear and it leaves a small enough hole that becomes increasingly hard to ignore. The fact that there arent any other memorably rendered characters to truly bounce off of McConaughey despite a talented ensemble only serves to stress this cryptic deficiency in the screenplay whipping as it does through many years and the movies central performance. Also Read David Oyelowo Gugu Mbatha-Raw to Star in Sci-Fi Thriller God Particle And if this all sounds like one more ""white savior"" movie it is even if it hews closer to the ""Glory"" model of admirably gripping painstakingly recreated outlier history than the ""Cry Freedom"" brand of dull tone-deaf nobility. There are choices Ross makes that push his hero even more into white-knight mode than necessary whether its showing him help Rachel learn to read when weve already seen her at the plantation sneaking glances at the owners childrens lessons or after the war having Newt literally walk freed blacks into a hostile polling place to ensure their federally granted voting privileges. (Early on Ross does give Moses one choice bit of perspective-correcting dialogue. When Newt marveling at Moses harsh collar says ""I guess you can get used to anything"" Moses quietly retorts ""No you cant."") Still theres a good deal here worth chewing on as a dramatic slice of little-known righteousness especially when Ross solemnly wades into the Reconstruction -- the movies best sequence tonally -- and shows how quickly and easily sham laws coupled with private hooded vengeance could bring an updated tinge of fear and unfairness to the newly unchained. Also Read Hunger Games Actor Mahershala Ali Cast as Cottonmouth in Marvels Luke Cage Less effective however are Rosss use of footnote text (in Ken Burns-regulation font no less) and the occasional flash forward to a 1948 court case in which Newts white-looking great grandson David (Brian Lee Franklin) is arrested for miscegenation by attempting to marry a white woman. As a slow across-the-eras reveal that Newt and Rachel eventually lived together as man and common-law wife (and that the struggle never really ended) it nevertheless plays more like a twist from a PBS documentary with recreations than an urgent drama about defiant activists falling in love against all odds. If ""Free State of Jones"" its firelit confabs rural greenery and Southern heat nicely captured by cinematographer Benoit Delhomme (""The Theory of Everything"") has a standing flaw its born of good intentions the need to teach and the fear of turning the past into melodrama. That you may learn a good deal about an unusually driven man but never quite feel emotionally connected to him means Ross has hit a workmanlike middle crafting a handsome textbook more than a blood-pumping portrait.

David Ehrlich Jun 20 2016 828 pm davidehrlich Share This Article Pin It Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Print Talk ""Free State of Jones"" STX Entertainment Hate -- as no one reading this needs to be reminded -- clings for life to this country like a cat with its claws sunk into the side of a space shuttle as it screams towards the stratosphere. So while the inert inelegant and (wait for it) somewhat problematic ""Free State of Jones"" may not be a valuable contribution to the canon of American historical epics the  shapelessness of its story is worth celebrating for how palpably it conveys the tenacity of prejudice. In the wake of emancipation a nefarious ""apprenticeship"" system is enacted in order to resume the tradition of slavery by another name; from the ruins of the Confederate Army the Ku Klux Klan rises up to lynch a race of newly liberated citizens. And all the while a brusque and bearded Matthew McConaughey rides against injustice from deep within the swampy heart of Mississippi punctuating a half-century of historical footnotes with the tip of his bayonet. ""Free State of Jones"" Sure to be a tough sit for anyone whos grown impatient with stories of white saviors ""Free State of Jones"" is the second film to be made about the life and times of Mississippis favorite renegade southern Unionist Newton Knight (the first being George Marshalls 1948 melodrama ""Tap Roots"") and also most likely the last. Beginning with the 1862 Battle of Corinth and stretching all the way to the middle of the 20th century at such a slow pace that it eventually feels as though its being told in real time this awkward war saga traces Knights remarkable evolution from a pacifist farmer to the leader of a well-regulated militia who liberated the length of Jones County Mississippi for all men. Written and directed by ""Seabiscuit"" helmer Gary Ross ""Free State of Jones"" is structured with the haphazard flow of a miniseries thats been cleaved down to feature length and shot with the boxed-in functionality of basic cable television; it would be a misfire even if it werent completely tone-deaf to the current climate. As it stands the well-intentioned film is most compelling as an argument for the value of Nate Parkers Sundance-winning ""The Birth of a Nation"" an unconvincing Nat Turner biopic that nevertheless pulses with the righteous urgency of the voiceless oppressed. In a genre that continues to be defined by the likes of ""Glory"" and ""Gettysburg"" a bad movie about slaves in self-motivated revolt is better than a bad movie about the white men who fought for their freedom. ""Schindlers List"" is a masterpiece but if 95% of Holocaust movies were about Germans who grew a conscience -- movies that turned the Jews into the supporting characters of their own genocide -- people would have good reason to be upset. READ MORE ""Free State of Jones"" Director Annotates His Film With A Website Of course there will always be a genuine value to humanistic stories about the power of empathy and no idea could resonate more strongly in contemporary America than the notion that were all in this together. At times McConaugheys Knight even comes off as a proto-Bernie bro on horseback arguing that no man should ever stay poor so that another man can be rich (and like Bernie his message that white people should be allies rather than obstacles often falls on deaf ears). Unfortunately over the course of 145 minutes Ross doesnt always find the most cogent way for his hero to express such high-minded principles. At one point in the film after Knight has amassed a militia of fellow deserters and freed slaves he tells his diverse group of freedom fighters that ""Everybody is just somebody elses nigger."" And uh... hmm. You can appreciate what he means -- solidarity -- but its one thing to be forcibly conscripted into an army whose soldiers are at war with basic human rights and quite another to be considered property under the eyes of the law. ""Free State of Jones"" The ""problematic"" elements of the film would be easier to overlook or contextualize if the movie told a compelling story but ""Free State of Jones"" shambles through a few dark chapters of American history with all the zeal of a kid doing his homework. McConaughey plays Knight like historys greatest badass a fearless killer pacifist who would sooner take his own life than take a shower; his performance is all surface and no soul. Ross doesnt do the star any favors fundamentally diluting his character from the start How cheap -- and cheapening -- to invent a nephew for Knight to avenge when the vile Twenty Negro Law was what pushed the actual man to action. Beyond that Ross consistently reduces Knight to a mechanism more of an impassioned historical tour guide than the protagonist of a would-be blockbuster (particularly during the final portions of the film which trudge into the post-war years with so much on-screen text that you spend more of the last act reading the movie than you do watching it). Knight was a unique American hero and remains largely overlooked because of that but his characterization here is so generic that he might as well have wandered out of an Ed Zwick epic. Hes even given a loyal ""native"" to befriend and a slimy red-bearded Confederate colonel to serve as his villain. Too robust to sink into the rhythms of a character study but too financially limited to tell a story that matches the sweep of its directors vision ""Free State of Jones"" is a film divided against itself and it cannot stand. Ross heart lies in the history and the dramatic trappings he uses to gussy it up all smack of apathy. Knights first wife (Keri Russell) and the son they had together are bizarrely relegated to the sidelines with no attention -- not even a furtive glance -- paid to their feelings for one another. Meanwhile Knights burgeoning relationship with a slave named Rachel (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) never generates a moment of drama and feels shoehorned into the story only so that Ross can swing for the fences with his films strangest gambit. ""Free State of Jones"" 45 minutes into the movie the action abruptly skips forward 85 years into the future dropping us into a sweltering Mississippi court room where one of Knight and Rachels great-grandsons is standing trial for miscegeny (though only 1/8th black it was still considered a crime for him to marry a white woman). Ross quickly deflates any hope that ""Free State of Jones"" will be Hollywoods biggest bait-and-switch since Pixars ""Brave"" cutting back to the 19th century and only checking in on the legal proceedings a handful of times after that. And yet however clumsy the attempt this unexpected narrative hail Mary is a rare glimpse of the movie that Ross could have made had he better reconciled his task of making a biopic with his desire for illustrating a history lesson. In a film that features a character turn to the camera and state that ""What you sow is what you reap"" in a film that forgets to mention that Rachel was actually owned by Knights grandfather before they married these flash-forwards are the only thing that makes the past feel like more than something that happened to other people.

Thats strange that you consider it a ""white savior"" movie as it was screened a few weeks back for the Congressional Black Caucus and the NAACP and tweeted reactions were overwhelmingly positive. So I really was looking forward to this. In fact the Legal Defense Fund tweeted they are hosting the premiere. Youd think they wouldnt support a ""white savior"" movie.

"Free State of Jones Review Matthew McConaughey as a Civil War Rebel | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review Free State of Jones Owen Gleiberman Chief Film Critic OwenGleiberman 38 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr Courtesy of STX Entertainment June 20 2016 | 0425PM PT Matthew McConaughey plays a Confederate deserter turned guerrilla saint in a Civil War drama more dogged than exciting. Newton Knight the Mississippi-farmer-turned-Confederate-deserter-turned-guerrilla-leader played by Matthew McConaughey in ""Free State of Jones"" is a historical figure of some controversy. Hes regarded by many as a heroic freedom fighter; some think of him as a reckless criminal. (The divide in opinion no surprise tends to fall along North/South lines.) But in ""Free State of Jones"" a Civil War drama written and directed with more doggedness than excitement by Gary Ross there is never much doubt about the kind of man that Newton Knight is. Hes Kevin Costner in ""Dances with Wolves"" crossed with a saintly Marxist professor crossed with a white version of Malcolm X. For all the ravaged surface appeal of McConaugheys performance the character is a little too good to be true but then thats just the sort of movie ""Free State of Jones"" is. Its a tale of racial liberation and heroic bloodshed that is designed at almost every turn to lift us up to that special place where we can all feel moved by what good liberals we are. The historical events exert some ongoing interest but the treatment is pious and stiff-jointed enough to leave you wondering what a two-hour-and-19-minute drama that never begins to attain the moral urgency and fascination of something like ""Glory"" or ""12 Years a Slave"" is doing being released in the middle of the summer. Box-office prospects dont exactly look rousing since the film itself simply isnt rousing enough. In 1862 when ""Free State of Jones"" begins Newton Knight is just an anonymous battle-weary medical nurse up to his elbows in carnage who ducks out of combat to take the corpse of a young neighbor home for a proper burial. Once there however he sees Confederate soldiers looting local farms and his witnessing of this minor outrage fuses with his already testy anger over a new law that exempts the oldest sons in Confederate households from military service as long as their family owns at least 20 slaves. (If they own 40 then two sons are exempt.) Its a law designed to protect rich men and thate enough to make Knight question what hes warring for. ""Im tired of helpin em fight for their damn cotton"" he says -- a line that perhaps calls a little too much attention to its contemporary topical relevance. (All thats missing are subtitles stating that the Iraq war was really fought for oil.) Newtons standoff with the looters leads to his desertion from the Confederate Army and he winds up hiding in the Mississippi bayou along with half a dozen former slaves who become the genesis of his newly formed fighting force. Its his rebellion against the Southern rebellion but its not just a combat unit. Its a ragtag band of idealists a community with Newton as its commander moral compass and spiritual guru. One way to characterize the McConaissance is to say that it was all about Matthew McConaughey going into the darkness. In his cheesy star-has-fallen period he was all sweetness and light -- the dimply narcissism the good-ol-boy charm so relentless that it had begun to verge on smarm. But in movies like ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" and (especially) ""Magic Mike"" where he began to let bits of sleaze and sinister manipulation ooze through the cracks of his aging pretty-boy glamour (a journey that culminated in his staggering performance on ""True Detective"") McConaughey began to dance between the angelic and the demonic and it liberated him as an actor. Of course he also won the Oscar for playing a scoundrel with a heart of gold in ""Dallas Buyers Club"" and that has a way of influencing the kind of roles you take. In ""Free State of Jones"" his Newton Knight is a figure of enlightened valor who has left any shades of moral ambiguity behind. Yet McConaughey has become so skilled at portraying sinewy desperation that he takes even a badass plaster saint like Knight and gives him an ornery intrigue around the edges. Gaunt and reserved with cold staring eyes and a scraggly black beard he makes Knight a ravaged desperado a Southerner of primitive Old Testament faith whos looking for somewhere to invest that belief since he can no longer find a place for it in the Confederacy. In the bayou when he meets Moses (Mahershala Ali) a former slave with a spidery metal guard thats been bolted around his neck it taps right into the depths of his human decency. A former blacksmith Knight volunteers to remove the guard with a hammer and wedge -- but the clanging sound is destined to bring on the soldiers and their dogs. So he and Moses and the other runaway slaves get ready to take up arms. The film builds up a fair amount of curiosity about how Knight is going to succeed with his insurrection given that the entire Confederate army of Mississippi is arrayed against him. But ""Free State of Jones"" is one of those historical dramas with a script thats big on crowning lines of moral fervor and not so big on nuts-and-bolts detail. At several points Ross employs real Civil War photographs (with explanatory titles) to advance the story and after the film uses one of these shots to tell us that in July 1863 Confederate desertions were on the rise we cut to Knights woodland guerrilla army -- and its suddenly a force of 100 people all united in their renegade passion. Im not sure that the film ever quite recovers from this short-handed piece of exposition. How does everyone under Knights command get along? More or less famously. Theres a fiddle-music montage of a corn-and-roast-pig picnic and we always know when were supposed to stop and hiss because the Confederate baddie Lt. Barbour (Bill Tangradi) shows up in his George A. Custer decadent blonde ringlets. Knights army by contrast is a racially and sexually integrated paramilitary utopia. It includes a handful of women who can shoot a rifle as well as any man and although most of the group is comprised of former Dixie soldiers theres almost no friction between blacks and whites. The way Ross presents it its really a Southern aristocrats war in which every one of the Confederates whove dropped out can see right through the illusion of why they were ever asked to fight. (Its all about the cotton man And the one percent.) The only instance of racial tension within Knights army comes when a soldier calls Moses the N-word and Moses simply replies ""How you aint?"" By which he means How you aint a n---r? -- since all of them black and white are being exploited by the very same forces. One truly has to wonder whether a conversation like this one ever took place in 1863. As Knights rebellion grows it takes over the southeast portion of Mississippi including Jones County which Knight declares to be ""the free state of Jones."" It would seem as though his declaration applies to matters of the heart as well. The film recounts the story of his relationship with a former slave Rachel (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) whom he teaches to read and fire a gun and who ultimately bears his child. The films portrayal of biracial harmony is admirable and touching yet the staging of this love story is far too decorous and restrained even when Knights wife Serena (Keri Russell) and Rachel wind up sharing the duty of raising Knights baby son. In reality Knight had five children with Rachel who became his common-law wife and nine children with Serena and he lived with both families on adjoining properties. That story would have made for a fascinating movie much more so than the tale of predigested enlightenment and generic idyllic romance that is ""Free State of Jones.""

Frank Lopez says July 26 2016 at 555 pm Great review. Hate movies that portray the white savior helping the inferior minorities. Cornball white liberals love these movies. If I were black these type of movies would probably embarass me greatly. Reply Karl says July 26 2016 at 654 pm INteresting pespective from a person whose comment shows so clearly exactly WHY these movies are so important and so needed-to remind us that even now there are racist people with racist attitudes who blithely whitewash the sins of history and prefer to bury their heads in the sand claiming that all is well in their lily white worlds perspective. Reply Jones says July 19 2016 at 515 am I heard this is a true story. still i didnt watch the movie. after the read of this article i think i should watch this movie thanks for article. Reply Karl says July 17 2016 at 805 am This review and the reviewers disgustingly cynical opinion had me frothing...if anything this movie didnt ""remind me what a good Liberal I was"" (to paraphrase his unfortunate choice of words); no more like it reminded me of how truly despicably evil the side of humanity which most accurately charactierizes modern Conservatism is and why it is SO important to make movies like this which remind us that if we dont learn from our past we are doomed to repeat it. This movie was AWESOMElt; incredible and VERY moving. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. PS Variety dump this loser of a reviewer. Reply stevenjohnson says June 30 2016 at 625 pm In real life the blacks and whites in Jones county trusted each other with their lives just as every band of fighters in war do. Owen Gleibermans insistence that they had to spew at each other on screen is childish. It can only be explained by his tacit assumption that black is black and white is white and neer the twain shall meet. He wants to believe that solidarity against the rulers is a fools dream. This is not a bad movie it is one that offends his politics. His claim the movie invites us to feel good about how liberal we are fails miserably. The movie is quite clear that Reconstruction was counter-revolutionary and ""we"" our country failed. The feel good liberal view is that Lincoln the political conciliator and unifier was the wiser man than the likes of Stevens and that mercy instead of revolutionary tribunals was the highest achievement of a blessedly non-revolutionary peace. Gleiberman has every right to be too reactionary to enjoy this movie. He has no right to pretend his distaste has anything to do with esthetic judgment. Reply Michael Brook says July 4 2016 at 1144 am The reviewer says ""the treatment is pious."" How else should one feel about an evil like slavery? Reply Mike Smith says June 28 2016 at 335 pm ""...what good liberals we are."" You must be completely ignorant of the role liberal Democrats played in slavery and the Civil War. Reply Michael Brook says July 4 2016 at 1110 am They actually referred to themselves as ""conservatives."" Reply Alice says June 27 2016 at 326 pm I was prepare to vigorously defend the movie but after seeing it I sadly have to admit the story could have been handled better. Anyone that knows the actual story might feel as I do that that the court case should have started the movie and gave raise to the rest of it. I did however think Mathew McConaughey did a decent job with the material provided. I only wish the movie had been more storytelling and less like a preachy documentary. Reply Michael Brook says July 4 2016 at 1108 am They actually referred to themselves as ""conservatives."" Reply Michael Brook says July 4 2016 at 1109 am Sorry - wrong OP. Richard Carter says June 22 2016 at 434 pm You dont like it cuz its preachy in a Biblical fashion the protagonists indignation arising from his presumably Christian faith. Sort of irritates you nibbles at the corners of your moral relativism rubs you the wrong way doesnt it? Thats good enough for me-think Im gonna go see it. Reply Jonathan says June 22 2016 at 541 pm Thats not what he wrote Richard. He has no problems with faith. Hes saying the ""crowning lines of moral fervor"" are heavy handed and preachy which detaches the audience from the characters. The entire trailer is McConaughey speechifying with no sight of an arc. Thats a tough way to sit through two and a half hours. Youre supposed to leave the theater feeling something. When youve been ""told"" something its not the same. Goes in one ear and out the other. Reply Richard Carter says June 25 2016 at 622 pm OK good point well made. Mick says June 21 2016 at 1145 pm I dont know what movie Gleiberman saw but it must not have been the same one I saw tonight. Free State of Jones was the best film Ive seen this year - by a long shot. McConaugheys performance was naturalistic mastery Mahershala Ali rips your guts out and Gugu Mbatha Raw your heart. A powerful movie. Ill be seeing it again. Reply Dallas says June 22 2016 at 531 pm Wait the premiere was last night in Los Angeles I believe. So you went Mick? You must be a pretty important guy. What are you doing here arguing with Gleiberman? Spinning??? Reply michael says June 21 2016 at 301 pm MM should stick to talking to his imaginary car friends. Reply anthony says June 21 2016 at 1222 pm In reply to Millerfilms query ""How can this film possibly have TWENTY-THREE producers??"" Most are from STXs company who did nothing But were paid by adding their fees in the budget So much for the probably NOT back-end participants. Look for all the future STXs films to have the same continuing STXs producers getting producers credit and adding their fees for doing nothing in the budgets. What else is new Welcome to Hollywoods MO of getting undeserved credit and accounting Reply Daryle says June 21 2016 at 918 am I cant WAIT to see this movie and I hope people wont be dissuaded by this reviewer What happened in Jones County had an impact long after the war and I would quote from the back cover Victoria Bynums new HISTORY book (The free state of Jones Mississippis longest Civil War) - ""there developed a mixed-race community that endured long after the Civil War ended and the ambiguous racial identity of their descendants confounded the rules of segregated Mississippi well into the twentieth century."" Critics really ought to check out their history whenever they write a review of a movie based on actual events. This is not the first time recently where I have been incensed by a review of a film based on history. Reviewers did the same thing with Ron Howards ""In the Heart of the Sea."" They more or less led people to believe they were going to the movie to see the Ahab/Ishmael Moby Dick story and were disappointed but the movie was really the true story of the tragedy of the Essex and was actually pretty faithful to history. I thoroughly enjoyed it and am sorry it end up tanking at the box office. People should check out Bynums book which has had excellent reviews and I hope theyll give the movie a chance. Comes out Friday I believe. Reply Michael Brook says July 4 2016 at 1117 am I saw it and I like it. I checked out the history before + after I saw it. Some things I thought nah theyre pumping him up appealing to modern sensibilities. But when I looked - it did happen. e.g. Knight did save a little black boy from ""legal slavery.""

McPhersons For Cause amp; Comrades Why Men Fought in the Civil War. Well worth a read. Reply EricJ says June 20 2016 at 510 pm Although looking at the trailer I kept thinking ""Didnt we just HAVE a crazy Southern embattled-farmer gun-toting standoff just recently in real life and....no one in the world was on their side?"" Reply Michael Brook says July 4 2016 at 1122 am No one was on Knights side. The Confederates tried to kill him and the Union ignored him. Reply Mike says June 20 2016 at 801 pm That was in Oregon. Dont think Oregon made it into the Confederacy. Reply Mike says June 20 2016 at 454 pm Ive read the Jenkinsamp;Stauffer book about the Free State of Jones. Well its a damn shame if Gary Ross didnt pull this off as the story of Newt Knight is probably one of the most fascinating long forgotten episodes in American Civil War history. I saw Ross website for background reference material and it is brilliant. Every historical movie should now come equipped with such information. However condensing Knights incredibly complicated (and long) life into 2 1/2 hours did seem to me like an impossible feat. More mini-series material to do the man justice. Nevertheless Ill be there opening night. Newt and Rachel Knight were the ultimate badasses and Ill be there to pay my respects.
