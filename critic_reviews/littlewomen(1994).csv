This new adaptation of Louisa May Alcotts classic 1868 novel about an exemplary mother in Civil War-era New England and her four well-adjusted independent-minded daughters is such a graceful unsentimental well-made movie that it would be a damn pity if the thing languished because all the guys in town were blowing their bucks on Dumb and Dumber. Let me therefore point out three big strengths of this film by My Brilliant Career director Gillian Armstrong and screenwriter Robin Swicord for sisterly consideration. First the ensemble work is exceptional. Winona Ryder follows her roles in The Age of Innocence and Reality Bites with an Oscar-worthy performance as Jo the writer who dreams of her own brilliant career (a role made famous by Katharine Hepburn in George Cukors glorious 1933 version -- one of three previous adaptations); Trini Alvarado (Babe) Claire Danes (TVs My So-Called Life) and that tough little Interview With the Vampire bloodsucker Kirsten Dunst play sisters Meg Beth and Amy with uncommon understanding; and Susan Sarandon is strong and serene as Mrs. March. Second Little Women is unself-consciously beautiful in its matter-of-fact attention to detail. Remember the big deal Martin Scorsese made about the look of The Age of Innocence in a watch me I know about fish forks kind of way? Armstrong doesnt make a big fuss about the quilts and teacups that fill her scenes so comfortably probably because she is on regular speaking terms with domesticity. And third this old story is full of contemporary wisdom. ""Nothing provokes speculation more than the sight of a woman enjoying herself"" Mrs. March tells her girls and they all get her point. So should you sisters. If you cant get the man (or boy) in your life to budge have a girls night out with Little Women and leave em guessing at what you enjoyed so much.

What the modern public has done to deserve it is unclear but 1990s audiences are the beneficiaries of an outstanding version of Louisa May Alcotts perennial one that surpasses even the best previous rendition George Cukors 1933 outing starring Katharine Hepburn. Since sound pictures came in every generation has gotten its own ""Little Women."" What the modern public has done to deserve it is unclear but 1990s audiences are the beneficiaries of an outstanding version of Louisa May Alcotts perennial one that surpasses even the best previous rendition George Cukors 1933 outing starring Katharine Hepburn. A moving passionately told story about the connections among four generations of a familys women -- and more tellingly the way women had to struggle to make a mark in a society in which their roles were heavily proscribed -- this handsomely produced period piece is easily the most emotionally effective bigscreen melodrama since ""The Joy Luck Club"" as well as the most intelligent. Even if many men particularly younger ones may choose to resist the pictures charms it will be warmly embraced by most viewers including women of all ages and it is easy to imagine some returning repeatedly. If smartly marketed Columbia has a long-running winner here. One measure of the films effectiveness is that it can stand equally well as a beautifully judged adaptation of a famous book a personal work by director Gillian Armstrong that is very much a companion piece to her first film ""My Brilliant Career"" and a 19th-century bookend for Winona Ryder to the late 20th-century characterization with which she started the year in ""Reality Bites."" Alcotts enduring 1868 novel about the growing up of four sisters in Concord Mass. during and after the Civil War has been filmed four times previously the first time as a silent in 1918. Cukors 1933 version is notable primarily for Hepburns luminous performance in the central role of Jo March and for the giddily conspiratorial feeling generated among the sisters although the picture seems rather stiff and starchy today. By contrast Mervyn LeRoys 1949 remake starring June Allyson and Elizabeth Taylor and a 1978 TV movie featuring Meredith Baxter were notable for very little at all. One significant hurdle for the filmmakers was to take contemporary audiences over the threshold of vastly different mores and social conventions to a time when earnestness family solidarity and sexual reserve were unquestioned standards of behavior and cynicism and the doubting of authority had scarcely been heard of. They have been notably successful in this regard thanks to the breezily conversational quality of Robin Swicords dialogue the warm informality of the young actresses and the firm concentration on dramatic essentials displayed by director Armstrong. The four March ""little women"" are Meg (Trini Alvarado) Jo (Winona Ryder) Beth (Claire Danes) and Amy (initially Kirsten Dunst then Samantha Mathis). Presided over by their mother Marmee (Susan Sarandon) while their father is off fighting in the Union Army the Marches were ""once one of our finest families"" in the snide opinion of a neighbor but have come to live in somewhat reduced circumstances in what is nevertheless a beautiful New England home. The spirited girls are enthralled with dressing up for their own little theatricals and zealously throw themselves into their projects which include helping the truly disadvantaged with irrepressible abandon. In addition the central character Jo is an aspiring writer who precociously spins melodramatic tales of adventure and crime. In due course in a period that atmospherically spans the seasons the Marches forge a strong friendship with the young man across the way Laurie (Christian Bale) whose dreams of a musical career would appear threatened by the call of the family firm. Beth catches scarlet fever as a result of her charitable work with the poor and is never the same again while the very traditional Meg begins a courtship with stolid tutor John Brooke (Eric Stoltz). Halfway through the story jumps ahead four years to Megs wedding to Brooke. Devastating Laurie by rejecting his marriage proposal Jo is encouraged by her mother to ""embrace your liberty"" and moves to New York City. The contrast between the highly feminine Concord and heavily masculine Manhattan is vividly expressed and Jo is only able to publish her sensationalist fiction under the name Joseph. But at her boarding house she meets a German immigrant philosophy professor Friedrich Bhaer (Gabriel Byrne) with whom she has an instant accord. They quote Walt Whitman together and discuss womens suffrage with other men and he introduces her to the world of opera which allows a tentative romance to bloom. At the same time Amy pursues her interest in painting in Europe where she becomes reacquainted with Laurie who has become something of a dissolute playboy. Spurred on by a family tragedy and Bhaers admonition that she ""should be writing from life from the depths of your soul"" Jo drops her formulaic fiction and fulfills her destiny by metamorphosing into Louisa May Alcott writing a novel about her family life. The ending which rather neatly wraps everything up still satisfies as a comparative view of how the various sisters are able to achieve something meaningful to each of them. Armstrong paces her scenes at about half the speed that Cukor did and they are all the better for it in terms of emotional resonance. Scenes are not milked for easy sentiment but build power due to the integrity of the writing and performances. However thwarted Jo may be at various stages artistically and personally she perseveres and happily a late 20th-century feminist veneer has not been unnaturally imposed upon the material. Performances by the actresses are all at least very good with Ryder Alvarado and Dunst making the strongest impressions. The male roles in the story have always been a bit thankless but Bale does a creditable job as the spurned suitor. Shot mostly in British Columbia film has a splendid period look thanks in good part to Jan Roelfs resourceful production design Colleen Atwoods impeccably detailed costumes and Geoffrey Simpsons burnished lensing. Thomas Newmans score is richly emotional without pandering. Pic is dedicated to kidnap-murder victim Polly Klaas from Ryders hometown of Petaluma and the late agent Judy Fox-Scott.

Starring Winona Ryder Susan Sarandon Trini Alvarado Kirsten Dunst Samantha Mathis Claire Danes Christian Bales Gabriel Byrne and Eric Stoltz. Directed by Gillian Armstrong. (PG. 110 minutes.) Meticulously crafted and warmly acted by a cast that includes Winona Ryder as Jo and Susan Sarandon as her mother the devoted Marmee ""Little Women"" is one of the rare Hollywood studio films that invites your attention slowly and elegantly rather than propelling your interest with effects and easy manipulation. Largely autobiographical ""Little Women"" now available on home video takes place in Concord Mass. during and after the Civil War. When it opens in 1864 Mr. March is away at war and his wife and daughters are left at home. In addition to passionate self- doubting Jo theres Meg (Trini Alvarado) the oldest and strongest; Beth (Claire Danes) the sickly one who never dreams of leaving home; and Amy (played by Kirsten Dunst as a 12-year-old and Samantha Mathis as a 16-year-old) the youngest and most determined to marry rich. The family may be hard- pressed during the war -- poor Meg has to borrow a friends dress to attend a coming-out ball and cadge a pair of fancy shoes from a free box -- but the love that the sisters draw from their mother is a rare luxury. A font of wisdom and kindness Marmee is the mother every girl dreams of having a model of composure and insight an early feminist who encourages her daughters to develop their intellect humor and moral courage to ""embrace their liberty.""

"Little Women | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; little-women ) Little Women (United States 1994) A movie review by James Berardinelli ""I think the title [of Little Women] has been so off-putting for men over the generations. They feel this is a terribly girly story. But its actually a wonderful epic tale about family where mens roles are just as important and deeply involved in the story... It is... full of heartfelt emotion and such memorable characters whose lively appeal transcends the years."" - Gillian Armstrong director of Little Women This third and most recent film adaptation of Louisa May Alcotts classic 1868 novel about family and crossing the barrier between girlhood and womanhood is a treatment for todays audiences. As faithful to the original story as a two-hour production is likely to be Little Women is in ways similar and dissimilar to its two cinematic predecessors (released in 1933 and 1949). This tale of four independent sisters of differing temperaments is undeniably melodramatic but its very good melodrama with an accumulation of vitality and charm that elevates the movie to an unexpectedly high level. The basic plot of Little Women isnt terribly original or invigorating; its the effective realization of several memorable characters that gives this film its strength. For those not familiar with the novel it centers around the March demesne of Orchard House in Concord Mass. With her husband away fighting in the Civil War Marmee (Susan Sarandon) is left alone to care for her four daughters the volatile and imaginative Jo (Winona Ryder) the sophisticated Meg (Trini Alvarado) the compassionate Beth (Claire Danes) and the romantic Amy (Kirsten Dunst as a child and Samantha Mathis as an adult). The girls share a bond that no outsider can penetrate although there are some willing to make the attempt -- most of whom are men. Theres Laurie (Christian Bale) a neighbor with a passion for the piano who becomes a friend to all the Marches; John Brooke (Eric Stoltz) a poor tutor who is smitten with Meg; and Professor Bhaer (Gabriel Byrne) a German immigrant who develops a friendship with Jo. With rich colorful cinematography (the Autumn scenes are especially vibrant) and a fine score by Thomas Newman Little Women is technically accomplished. Its the performances however that make this movie special. Winona Ryder fashions a near-perfect Jo Alcotts headstrong alter-ego in the fictional autobiography. Had it been demanded of her the actress undoubtedly could have carried the entire film. However this version allows the other sisters some development independent of Jo and all the actresses hold their own. The only hiccup comes as a result of the change in the aging Amy from the energetic and charismatic Kirsten Dunst to the more sedate Samantha Mathis. Christian Bale after a couple of extremely weak performances (in Newsies and Swing Kids) finally displays some recognizable talent. In fact Bale is so solid as Laurie that its hard to credit this actor as the same one who joined Robert Sean Leonard in the streets of Nazi Germany. Perhaps the greatest fault -- and some may not see it as such -- is that even the best-developed characters in Little Women display an alarming lack of character flaws. Everyone is almost always good kind sweet and pleasant. Rare are the moments when someone says something nasty or does something unsavory. So much niceness occasionally makes Little Women seem too sugary and scripted. Nevertheless the tale is engrossing enough and the film put together with such obvious affection that its not hard to dismiss those things as necessary elements of a beloved period piece.

This new adaptation of Louisa May Alcotts classic 1868 novel about an exemplary mother in Civil War-era New England and her four well-adjusted independent-minded daughters is such a graceful unsentimental well-made movie that it would be a damn pity if the thing languished because all the guys in town were blowing their bucks on Dumb and Dumber. Let me therefore point out three big strengths of this film by My Brilliant Career director Gillian Armstrong and screenwriter Robin Swicord for sisterly consideration. First the ensemble work is exceptional. Winona Ryder follows her roles in The Age of Innocence and Reality Bites with an Oscar-worthy performance as Jo the writer who dreams of her own brilliant career (a role made famous by Katharine Hepburn in George Cukors glorious 1933 version -- one of three previous adaptations); Trini Alvarado (Babe) Claire Danes (TVs My So-Called Life) and that tough little Interview With the Vampire bloodsucker Kirsten Dunst play sisters Meg Beth and Amy with uncommon understanding; and Susan Sarandon is strong and serene as Mrs. March. Second Little Women is unself-consciously beautiful in its matter-of-fact attention to detail. Remember the big deal Martin Scorsese made about the look of The Age of Innocence in a watch me I know about fish forks kind of way? Armstrong doesnt make a big fuss about the quilts and teacups that fill her scenes so comfortably probably because she is on regular speaking terms with domesticity. And third this old story is full of contemporary wisdom. ""Nothing provokes speculation more than the sight of a woman enjoying herself"" Mrs. March tells her girls and they all get her point. So should you sisters. If you cant get the man (or boy) in your life to budge have a girls night out with Little Women and leave em guessing at what you enjoyed so much.
