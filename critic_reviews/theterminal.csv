A better film exists about him British photographer Glen Luchfords From Here to Where blends fact and fiction by featuring a determined American filmmaker trying to document Merhans life. How prophetic. All ties to reality however are much looser here. Forever the crowd-pleaser Spielberg ditches Iran and France (funny that) in favour of a lovable east European - Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) - and New Yorks JFK airport where Viktor is stranded following a coup in his homeland. Face-to-face with the unerring machinery of the state the bumbling Viktor shacks up in the departures lounge has a fleeting affair with a passing air hostess (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and even plays cupid to a Mexican airport worker (Diego Luna) and his belle. Spielbergs desire to highlight the power of the state against the little guy is flawed by a resort to light comedy or soppy romance at every turn. His wholesale recreation of the minutiae of an international airport is gratifying (see Longshots) but it becomes a theatre for too many incoherent or compromised arguments. Does Viktor have to be a likeable guy to deserve fair treatment? Is the entire immigration system rotten or as Spielberg suggests is only the character of one over-ambitious immigration officer (Stanley Tucci) in need of redemption? Theres the potential here for a chilling critique of American bureaucracy or a light measured romance in the vein of Lost in Translation. Ultimately it straddles both and achieves neither.

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

But the director -- surely our film cultures Norman Rockwell -- knows about the telling gesture the symbol the buildup the silence and the subtle roots of a scene. Unlike other merchants of big such as Jerry Bruckheimer he knows how to put special effects and big scenes in human context. Its the terrified look in Roy Scheiders eyes as he waits for the shark that makes ""Jaws"" as powerful as the big fish itself. When Richard Dreyfuss becomes obsessed with building a giant mound of earth in ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" the stricken expression in the eyes of his children raises the emotional ante. And in ""Jurassic Park"" that scary introduction of the T. Rex is indelibly carved in our memories thanks to his reflection caught in a cars side mirror the one that says ""Objects are closer than they appear."" With nothing bigger than a jet plane hovering in the background Spielberg has made a small and charming story out of ""The Terminal."" Set exclusively in an international-arrivals terminal at New Yorks JFK International Airport the movie doesnt have a terrorist in sight. No ticking time bomb no clock set to a doomsday deadline no SWAT teams. Just a tall tale full of warm and fuzzy characters. In a way its the perfect follow-up to Spielbergs ""Catch Me if You Can"" another modestly set drama that involves airplanes. Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) a resident of the (fictional) country of Krakozhia (somewhere in that former Soviet Union corner of the planet) with virtually no command of English is caught up in something he doesnt understand. He has just flown into JFK. And suddenly hes being led into the office of the airport supervisor Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci). Frank tries to explain to Viktor. While he was in the air a military coup took place in Krakozhia. Thus his country is temporarily without official identity. Legally it doesnt exist. Viktors nationality visa status and everything else are frozen. He cannot set foot in the United States until a new government establishes itself. ""Imagine these potato chips are Krakozhia"" says Dixon pointing to a bag of chips on his desk. He holds up an apple. ""This apple represents the Liberty rebels."" Frank brings the apple down on the bag with a resounding bang. Chips go flying into the air. ""You are at this time simply unacceptable."" Viktors new home is . . . the terminal. And so begins a physically claustrophobic yet highly entertaining caper set in a mini-universe of Starbucks Borders escalators and pushcarts. Gradually Viktor starts to see the lay of the land its permanent staffers and the regular passers-through. There are attendants such as the food-services grunt (Diego Luna) who enlists Viktor to get him a date with a female customs officer (Zoe Saldana). Theres Gupta (Kumar Pallana) an Indian floor cleaner who delights in watching people slip on his wet floors. And most significantly for Viktor is flight attendant Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones) whos forever coming and going but always meeting the same married man. After getting to know Viktor she begins to realize she can look for a man whos gentle not to mention single. Watching all of Viktors social encounters is shifty-eyed Frank a humorless and literal-minded bureaucrat whos up for a promotion. He watches Viktor with concern; wondering how he can get rid of this guy without breaking the law or messing up his ambition to become the airports field commissioner. The movie does have its cheese factor. Hes Steven Spielberg not Stanley Kubrick as we found out in ""Artificial Intelligence A.I."" But ""The Terminal"" is also delicately funny and inventive thanks to writers Andrew (""The Truman Show"") Niccol Sacha Gervasi and Jeff Nathanson (who wrote ""Catch Me if You Can"") and of course the director himself. There are fine little touches everywhere ""Strangers in the Night"" playing faintly in the background as Viktor builds a makeshift bed out of chairs on his first night in the terminal; or the frenzied intensity in the security room as Frank and his underlings watch Viktors movements by closed-circuit camera. At one point Viktor is faced with a side door that offers easy escape into America. Frank is hoping Viktor will walk through the door thereby relieving him of his responsibilities. But Viktor isnt quite sure. He looks at the door checks around then takes a couple of steps backward. ""Guess hes trying to get a running start"" hypothesizes Frank. Viktors hesitation and Franks agony continue; and its just one of many such appealing and entertaining moments to come. THE TERMINAL (PG-13 128 minutes) -- Contains mild sexual content.

On a gigantic set re-creating an international airline facility right down to the napkins at the Burger King and the Stephen King novels in the revolving rack at Borders the great American director tells a discordant unsatisfying sometimes emotionally incoherent story about loss hope redemption and taking showers at the sink. <a href=""http//ad.doubleclick.net/jump/wpni.artsandlivingarticle/movies/reviews;dir=hunternode;dir=artsandliving;dir=movies;dir=reviews;dir=hunter;page=article;kw=;ad=ss;ad=bb;ad=hp;pos=ad26;sz=300x250;tile=20;abr=ie;ord=1087561884433?""></a> <a href=""http//ad.doubleclick.net/jump/wpni.artsandlivingarticle/movies/reviews;dir=hunternode;dir=artsandliving;dir=movies;dir=reviews;dir=hunter;page=article;kw=;ad=ss;ad=bb;ad=hp;pos=ad27;sz=160x600;tile=20;abr=ie;ord=1087561884433?""></a> <a href=""http//ad.doubleclick.net/jump/wpni.artsandlivingarticle/movies/reviews;dir=hunternode;dir=artsandliving;dir=movies;dir=reviews;dir=hunter;page=article;kw=;ad=ss;ad=bb;ad=hp;pos=ad24;sz=336x850;tile=20;abr=ie;ord=1087561884434?""></a> Tom Hanks ever adorable in that lumpy Everyguy way of his plays a visitor from a mythical Eastern European country that while hes in the air essentially ceases to exist. Thus he ceases to exist. He cannot enter the United States because he has no valid passport and he cannot return home because he has no valid country. So as the movie has it he spends a year in a hell only a Samuel Beckett could imagine the arrival concourse. Hanks is great; the movie isnt. In the first place you never buy into the premise. Certainly you think a deal could be reasonably worked out and a sensible customs and immigration bureaucracy would find some way to grant this hapless potato a temporary visa. Its never credible that theyd just let him stay there for a year homeless without visible means of support living in some kind of conveniently abandoned gate remodeling project. (There was a somewhat similar real-life case in a Paris airport -- but thats you know France.) You can feel Steven Spielbergs impulse toward mimicry particularly in the early going. At first the film seems almost like a high-tech ""Cast Away"" in which Hankss Viktor Navorski is like his character in that movie alone on an island trying desperately to survive coming up with brilliant improvisations. At least he doesnt have a meaningful emotional relationship with a volleyball. Another inspiration seems to be -- desert islands again -- J.M. Barries ""The Admirable Crichton"" which argued that in a state of nature social distinctions break down and the true aristocrats of the species emerge. And thats a pretty good description of Hankss Navorski He turns out to have little time for self-pity but just sets to work to quickly build himself a decent life. Hes a natural aristocrat with a deep humanity and a vivid morality to boot. Hes resilient resourceful compassionate without rancor or aggression. He wont steal he wont beg he wont disobey. He plays by the rules and within the rules soon flourishes winning the hearts and minds of the ""little people"" of the terminal support staff bringing his sunshine to their beleaguered lives. Hes like a being beamed down from the Planet of Eternal Optimism lightening and brightening the world circumscribed though it may be wherever he goes. You think I overstate? You ought to watch Spielberg overstate But the main stylistic influence seems to be Frank Capra. This is the most ostentatious old-movie re-creation Spielberg has done since ""Always"" his 1989 remake of ""A Guy Named Joe"" and you can feel him struggling to achieve the brilliant tonal balance and minutely detailed orchestration of payoffs that Frank Capra was able to cram into his legendary paeans to the little guy standing up to the forces of corrupt bureaucracy such as ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" and so forth. But he has much less luck than Capra -- or I suppose less skill. The movie is really all subplot start to finish and of the four or five narrative arcs it tracks three or four simply dont work. The early evocation of the culture of the Terminal its physical environs its limits its possibilities all that is fine. It gets exactly the weird vibration of gigantic civic architecture that sense of faux warmth and brightness artificially inserted into huge dead industrial space. Viktors acceptance into ""little people"" culture particularly as he woos and wins janitors waiters clerks and contractors to his side is fine.But then it begins to go off kilter. The ugliness of the federal officers -- personified by an officious Stanley Tucci -- seems uncalled for and particularly unhelpful as these men have incredibly difficult jobs balancing efficiency against security during a time of terror. They should be the heroes not the villains. Then there comes a point where the script requires Viktor to serve as a kind of matchmaker between a young food service worker (Diego Luna) and a young female customs officer. This one is way miswired the young actress in the part Zoe Saldana is probably the best thing in the film -- warm beautiful and wonderfully accessible behind her uniform. And she and Hanks have the best chemistry; you want somehow for them to connect because they take such deep pleasure in each other and they seem so brilliantly suited. Instead once the matchmaking transaction is fulfilled shes exiled from the story which in turn comes to settle for romantic tension on Viktors attempts to woo a fast beautiful international flight attendant named Amelia Warren played by Catherine Zeta-Jones. This one never begins to work. La Zeta-Jones is offered as one of those aging beauties whove seen too much and done too much and spent too much time with handsome but married men. Yeah another one of those; its as if shes wandered in from a David Mamet play about Hollywood. Besides the cliche disparagement of flight attendants the character feels too brittle and modern for the rest of the movie and I never believed for a second that the redemption of decency and honor Viktor is offering her would have a whisper of success. I suppose she represents the America that poor Viktor can yearn for but never inhabit but that symbolic meaning has no weight when the scenario supporting it is so incredible. Then theres the payoff. This is the part that Frank Capra hit out of the park every time Remember Zuzus petals. Boy if youre not weeping then youre the Tin Man. In Spielbergs concoction the emotional weight of the movie is concealed in the reason for Viktors visit which is itself concealed in a Planters Peanuts can he carries. Its mysterious meaning -- this is so old-movie -- teases us for an hour and a half. You know itll be something that socks you right in the puss Dads ashes Moms diamond ring dead brothers Medal of Honor cousins sisters address key to a safety deposit box crammed with original Haloid stock . . . something. But its practically nothing. The balloon deflates the air goes out of the sails and you think Thats what this has been about? Yeah sorry Thats what this has been about. The Terminal (128 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for mild sexual content and language.

Need an entire airport terminal complete with dozens of shops and restaurants constructed from scratch? An Oscar winner (Catherine Zeta-Jones) in a relatively small role? A story so sweet anyone else who made it would be accused of being a sap? ""The Terminal"" is quintessential Spielberg perfectly cast technically breathtaking sentimental to the point of being one sugar cube away from gooey and extremely pleasurable to watch. Its not the directors best even among his recent films -- it doesnt have the lilt of ""Catch Me If You Can"" or the crackerjack story of ""Minority Report"" -- but it works just fine. Based (loosely) on a real-life story the film is set almost entirely at the international terminal at New Yorks JFK airport where Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) has taken up residence. A native of an Eastern European country torn by strife he arrives just in time to learn that a coup has taken place back home and that his passport is no longer recognized by the U.S. He can neither leave America nor enter it -- he is in the words of airport official Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci marvelous as an officious little bureaucrat) ""a citizen of nowhere."" And so Viktor begins a strange temporary life in the terminal making friends finding employment even falling in love with a pretty flight attendant (Zeta-Jones). The film is a little vague about how much time goes by but that feels right Airport terminals have their own sort of timelessness in which everything stays the same. A running joke throughout is how Viktors life has become a metaphor of the sort used by frequent travelers. ""Dont you just feel like you live at the airport?"" a businessman asks as they shave side-by-side in a terminal mens room. Viktor just stares into the mirror unable to respond. Hanks pale and anxious (theres a permanent worry line between his eyes serving as punctuation to his sentences) is the heart of the film and his performance feels so honest that he balances the screenplays sentimentality. Viktor believes in rules in order. Hes guided by the knowledge that he must do the right thing (thats why he wont just slip out of the terminal when Dixons back is turned) and hes come to New York on a mission. I wont reveal it to you -- its one of the films more offbeat surprises -- but will say that its another variant on Spielbergs favorite theme fathers and sons. There are bumpy moments in Sacha Gervasi and Jeff Nathansons screenplay (Viktor learns English even more quickly than Robin Williams Vladimir in ""Moscow on the Hudson"") and the film feels just a tad overlong but ultimately ""The Terminal"" creates an intricate fairy-tale world of its own. Within this sweet universe the movies excesses -- a sudden wedding scene an elaborate sculpture built by Viktor as a tribute to love a wildly romantic spotlit kiss -- seem not over-the-top but natural as Spielberg affectionately plays with the many meanings of the word ""home."" Homecoming here becomes a reward; as does the movie if you let it.

TERMINAL Viktor Navorski (TOM HANKS) must make the best of his accommodations when a coup in his homeland leaves him stranded at the airport in DreamWorks Pictures THE TERMINAL. Being stuck at an airport is actually enjoyable thanks to Hanks Spielberg 1 / 2 Back to Gallery The Terminal Comedy-drama. Starring Tom Hanks Stanley Tucci and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Directed by Steven Spielberg. (PG-13. 130 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In ""The Terminal"" Steven Spielberg has made an ineffably appealing and rather sweet film about a guy who gets stuck in an airport. Thats not easy. Say what you will about some flaws in the movies overall conception or its tendency to veer into schmaltz which has always been Spielbergs default setting. But first take a minute to admire a filmmaker who can transform a potentially static premise into a movie thats one long succession of interesting detailed and amusing moments. Im not in love with ""The Terminal"" but I liked every minute in it. Other films are like empty containers; this ones full. Its full of invention full of moments full of business full of the nuances of human interaction full of feeling. Perhaps it takes a picture about confinement to fully demonstrate how much Spielberg has always been about the journey not the destination. With mediocre filmmakers the whole movie is contained in the climax. With great filmmakers the whole movie is happening every second. Tom Hanks gets his best role in several years as Viktor a visitor from a small Eastern European nation who arrives at New Yorks JFK airport only to find out that his passport is invalid following a sudden coup in his country. He cant go home but without a valid passport he cant enter the United States either. To make matters worse he doesnt understand English so when his plight is explained to him he can only nod. Hes set loose in the international airport to improvise a life for himself. Descriptions of ""The Terminal"" have made it sound gimmicky. What needs to be realized is that despite an undertone of whimsicality and the subtle comedy of Hanks playing Viktors situation carries significant emotional weight. Certainly anyone who has ever been to a foreign country without knowing the language can immediately sympathize with Viktors self-consciousness and near- panic every time he has to ask anyone for anything. (Likewise Viktors wild- eyed freak-out at seeing his country in flames on CNN without being able to understand the newscast brought me right back to my 2001 vacation finding out about Sept. 11 on Italian television.) Its a feeling of complete dislocation and vulnerability. Yet gradually he gets the hang of it. Think of ""The Terminal"" as a less somber less unintentionally ridiculous and more visually stimulating version of Robert Zemeckis ""Cast Away"" with Hanks once again figuring out how to eat where to sleep and how to amuse himself in an inhospitable environment. Along with Spielberg screenwriters Jeff Nathanson Sacha Gervasi and Andrew Niccol somehow found a way to create a sense of forward motion through what easily could have seemed like a succession of disparate incidents. The audience is even able to believe in and track the progress of Viktors English- language immersion. Viktor meets a lot of people. Most significantly he meets a flight attendant played by Catherine Zeta-Jones who takes an interest in Viktor whom she assumes to be another frequent traveler. As played by Jones who is even more beautiful than usual here the flight attendant is like the female fantasy from countless 1970s films -- a warm neurotic available troubled woman who above all is unaccountably attracted to the humble hero. The romance is appealing but it also exists on the movies fault line the one between truth and fable. Its a strange thing to realize Spielberg never adequately accounts for why Viktor must stay in that airport for months. Instead he uses his cinematic fairy dust to make us stop asking the question. As you may have read theres a fellow in France who has lived in de Gaulle airport for 15 years. In his case he just refuses to leave. Spielberg eschews that possibility -- that would make Viktor a little nutty. Instead he puts the blame on the authorities represented in this case by Stanley Tucci as the frazzled head of airport security. But Spielberg wont go too far with that either because he wants to keep everybody within the realm of cuddly. Its something of a problem that Spielberg is uninterested in an honest examination of the very situation he presents. Hes not interested in why a guy would live in an airport. Nor is he interested in why another guy would force a guy to live in an airport. You know what Spielberg is interested in? Hes interested in making ""E.T. "" all over again because E.T. is precisely what Viktor turns into -- a wise kind benevolent alien who eventually has to go home but in the meantime is all about sharing the love. Well so what? ""E.T."" was a good picture too. Anyway someones got to make Spielberg movies and it might as well be Spielberg. -- Advisory Some mild ribald humor.

Not only will stranded fliers find this comedy diverting enough to forget their own travails but they may feel inordinately grateful to be able to walk out the airports doors once they reach their destination. Man without country Tom Hanks as Viktor Navorski who is trapped at JFK. DreamWorks Pictures Such was not the case for the unfortunate Viktor Navorski. He leaves his fictional tiny Eastern European homeland of Krakozhia to visit New York City but because of a coup and U.S. red tape he finds himself trapped in the international terminal of JFK. At least its JFK where there are plenty of diversions of which the resourceful Viktor ultimately partakes. Viktor is convincingly played by charismatic Tom Hanks who even pulls off a Slavic accent. Navorski with open-hearted warmth and innate integrity could be Forrest Gumps brighter Balkan cousin. The story is loosely based on a true story of an Iranian man trapped in Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris. Hanks and director Steven Spielberg bring charm to a story that is part fish-out-of-water fable part romantic comedy and part heartwarming drama. ABOUT THE MOVIE The Terminal    (out of four) Stars Tom Hanks Catherine Zeta-Jones Stanley Tucci Chi McBride Diego Luna Director Steven Spielberg Distributor DreamWorks Pictures Rating PG-13 for brief language and drug references Opens nationwide today Despite the films considerable charm elements of the plot dont always work. The least believable aspect is the romance between Viktor and Amelia the beautiful but unlucky-in-love flight attendant played by Catherine Zeta-Jones. Zeta-Jones does little to invest her character with depth or likability. For a simple soul such as Viktor to hook up with a smooth operator such as Amelia who is smitten with a married man but also seems to have a man in every port strains credulity. Many of the other supporting performances are worth noting. Stanley Tuccis officious twit of an airport manager has some funny scenes with Hanks and airport staff. And theres a quirky scene-stealing role by Kumar Pallana (The Royal Tenenbaums). Another small sticking point Initially Viktors ability to understand English is minimal. But depending on the level of comedy needed for the scene he grows more or less fluent. One day he cant understand the idea that his country has experienced a revolution; the next hes urging Amelia to get a pair of ""sensible shoes."" But if moviegoers suspend their disbelief -- easy enough thanks to the diverse and talented cast as well as Spielbergs capable direction -- theyre bound to enjoy this cinematic fantasy.

Now Hollywood is the biz of the buzz. Buzz is the murmur that precedes a films release; it usually starts in a studios publicity department. But good buzz can turn bad when outsiders see the film and start dishing. (The outsiders are almost never critics. Weve been out of the power equation for ages.) Tabloid headlines play a role too. When the stars are Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez and the film is Gigli the anticipatory mood can quickly sour from must-see to buzz-saw. Bad buzz has recently hit the summers big grownup drama Steven Spielbergs The Terminal and the big grownup comedy The Stepford Wives. Stepford endured lots of rewriting reshooting and trimming to a terse 93 min. In other words the film -- a remake of the 1975 thriller about ""perfect"" suburban women who turn out to be robots -- underwent the same radical makeover the same behavioral modification as the wives of Stepford. And with the same goal to make it prettier and more pleasing. As for the Spielberg film in early June the Internet cinephile site Aint It Cool News blared the headline IS THE TERMINAL RESHOOTING ITS ENDING RIGHT NOW? and noted that some industry screenings had been canceled.

The 10 films Hanks starred in before this year each grossed more than 100 million at the North American wickets. He faltered only with this springs The Ladykillers and that one doesnt count. (Making a film with indie icons like the Coen brothers -- or with Charlie Kaufman as Jim Carrey did for the similarly low-grossing Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind -- is considered image-polishing pro bono work for a big star like an off-Broadway stint or a benefit concert.) In The Terminal Viktor Navorski (Hanks) arrives at a New York City airport on a flight from his native land Krakozhia. The country has just suffered a coup and until the U.S. recognizes a legitimate regime he cant go into the city or back home. (Its not explained why many others on his flight wouldnt be in the same predicament.) So Viktor is under airport arrest; to find food work a place to sleep and a woman to love he must rely on his own resources. Which are considerable. This is after all a Spielberg movie (Viktor is E.T. the sweet alien who wants to fulfill his mission and go home) and a Hanks film (Viktor is the castaway one man in a strange environment making do with whats available). The surprise about The Terminal is not that it got bad buzz but that its a bad film. Several bad films actually. First its a comedy of desperation with lots of sight gags (a machine that spits quarters in Viktors face too many people slipping on a wet floor) in the style of French comic actor-director Jacques Tati. Then its a love story as Viktor romances a flight attendant (Catherine Zeta-Jones). Finally the uplifting and heart tugging kick in. The Terminal is Spielbergs shortest feature since the first Jurassic Park yet it drags plods piling one lifeless situation atop another. For all the effort and good intentions the movie is in-terminal-ble. In the case of Buzz v. Stepford yes the movie is a little messy. But thats forgivable since it has a wonderfully wounding malice directed at both the Stepford Conn. contingent of Energizer Bunny wives and the New Yorkers who have just moved in.

"Steven Spielbergs The Terminal never quite takes off. Slate Sign In Sign Up Steven Spielbergs The Terminal never quite takes off. Steven Spielbergs The Terminal never quite takes off. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 17 2004 720 PM Terminal Velocity Steven Spielbergs melodramatic The Terminal never quite takes off. By David Edelstein Terminal goes nowhere fast Taxicab confession I used to love hanging out in airports--before 9/11 that is when the real world began to intrude and it was impossible to wander around staring voyeuristically at all the attractive and/or interesting people hurrying to or from places Id never see. After 9/11 there would be guards whod look at me funny; I was a potential terrorist instead of just an anonymous weirdo. I miss those airport days. When I got tired of looking at people Id watch planes take off and land or just use the bustle as white noise and get a ton of reading or writing done. Airports are a pleasant combination of chaos and order sweat-stained humanity and sterility. Starbucks aint no substitute. This all has absolutely nothing to do with The Terminal (DreamWorks) the new Steven Spielberg/Tom Hanks comedy--although I wish it did because the movie would be better with a dash of airport fetishism. In his last film Catch Me if You Can (2002) Spielberg caught the spirit of that epicenter of finger-popping 60s cool the Eero Saarinen-designed TWA terminal at JFK Airport complete with Sinatra singing ""Come Fly With Me."" The story of a con man without a country that movie was larky and sad in the same breath; the prospect of Spielberg making a whole film in a terminal exploring it top to bottom as a kind of ecosystem through the eyes of a non-English-speaker whos marooned seemed too good to be true. It was. The Terminal isnt a disaster but after an entertaining start it congeals into something icky and fake and it leaves you thinking that Spielberg and his team of screenwriters (Sacha Gervasi and Jeff Nathanson from a story by Andrew Niccol and Gervasi) missed the real story. Advertisement Hanks is Viktor Navorski a non-English-speaker from the fictional Eastern European country of Krakozhia. He looks heavy and pasty in his ill-fitting suit (so much for that Cast Away diet) and he hands his passport to the customs officer like a guy who long ago made his peace with giving papers to men in uniforms. He doesnt even seem put out when hes taken to the airport security official Frank Dixon (Stanely Tucci) and his uniformed aide Thurman (Barry Shabaka Henley) who briskly explain that his government has been overthrown in a coup and his passport is no longer valid. Dixon ends that scene by informing Viktor--who of course doesnt understand a word except ""Krakozhia""--that he has fallen into a void He cant fly back and he cant enter the United States. He is ""unacceptable."" The airport (its obviously supposed to be JFK) will be Viktors home. It sounds implausible but there was an Iranian stranded in Frances Charles de Gaulle airport under similar circumstances--hes still there in fact refusing to leave having possibly lost his mind. Even if it were implausible though the theme is irresistible adaptation. Here is a hero whos hopelessly out of his element yet through doggedness and smarts and a primal survival instinct he becomes a master of a new environment. Were more used to adaptation stories in the Robinson Crusoe mode like Cast Away (2000). Here Hanks island cave is a gate thats under construction. Viktor breaks up some seats for a bed and cuts the fuse on those awful fluorescents and the speakers spewing Muzak (the song is ""Stranger in Paradise"" ho ho). He figures out that returning luggage carts to their racks will generate quarters which he uses to buy fast food. He picks up some pidgin English he gets to know the employees and he learns How Things Work at a capitalist airport. So far so fun. Hanks does good subtle physical comedy (Viktors an innocent not an idiot) and Spielberg treats the airport as a multileveled toy store teeming with exotic creatures. The director and star have a greater time with scenes in which Viktor plays hide-and-seek with security cameras. But The Terminal begins to edge into a tiresome brand of melodrama First Tuccis Dixon becomes a villain not just callously indifferent to Viktors plight but actively malevolent driven mad by his desire to know what the Krakozhian carries in a rusty Planters peanut can. Then Viktor turns into a populist folk hero among the immigrants minorities and minimum wagers now he facilitates the romance of a food service worker (Diego Luna) and a customs agent (Zoe Saldana); now he rescues a distraught Russian trying to carry medicine from Canada to his sick father; now he makes peace with a misanthropic janitor (Kumar Pallana from The Royal Tenenbaums); now he woos the unlucky-in-love flight attendant played by Catherine Zeta-Jones. This Chaplinesque sweetie warms the hearts of everyone but Tucci that meanie. And when he finally reveals whats in that peanut can ... Well thats when I gave up on the movie. After a decade (the 80s) when he frequently veered into mawkishness Spielberg has at last learned to soft-pedal the shlock and not every subplot here ends happily. Zeta-Jones doesnt go soft on her weak-willed character whos hopelessly smitten with a married man (Michael Nouri) and Tucci almost--almost--makes you credit Dixons absurd logic. (If he really wanted to be head of airport security hed bring in the press and make himself a tabloid hero; he wouldnt let this poor Krakozhian wander the airport making him look impotent.) But most of the payoffs are cheap and Spielbergs tastefulness doesnt save from fatuousness the vision of smiling little people (many of them dark) throwing in their lot with Viktor against the Man. The filmmakers built an entire airport terminal in California for this movie complete with real stores (lots of product tie-ins) huge banks of lights and matte paintings of the distant cityscape. Everyone who walked onto the set was reportedly blown away even hard-to-blow-away people like Spielberg. But you know what? It looks like an airport. They should have rented. For all the lip service it gives to the idea of Homeland Security The Terminal misses the chance to explore the divided feelings that airports and the arrival of foreigners have on us post-9/11 in which everything romantic and open-ended (and for that matter fetishistic) about air travel has become permeated with dread. The world explodes but bland and semidelusional Hollywood sentimentality thats a comforting constant.

I dont suppose Spielberg had Aleichem in mind when he made The Terminal which is set in a supermodern airport fitted with all manner of electronic gizmos. Spielberg loves his state-of-the-art toys but he also loves nothing better than a holy fool who can humanize a cold unfeeling world. In Viktor Navorski a visitor from the equally fictitious East European country of Krakhozia he has a man-child capable of turning an airport -- and by extension America itself -- into a warm and fuzzy village. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Landing at JFK with a beat-up suitcase a smattering of guidebook English phrases (""Vhere can I buy Nike shooz?"") and a mysterious can of Planters peanuts the amiably clueless Viktor played by Tom Hanks with a mastery of Russian vowels that would put Meryl Streep to shame is devastated to learn that his country has been overrun by a coup and that hes now a stateless person who can neither return home nor leave the airport and visit Manhattan. No less horrified is Frank Dixon (the reliably steely Stanley Tucci) the ambitious acting airport chief who first informs the astounded bumpkin that as far as he is concerned ""America is closed"" -- then bends every rule in the book to try and get Viktor out of the airport so that he can get lost in America and become some other heedless bureaucrats problem. This is easier said than done for Viktor is not only a good Soviet citizen who has spent his life following the rules but an angelic innocent who couldnt deceive if his life depended on it. In short order this sturdy literal-minded peasant improvises a cozy home in a disused corner of the terminal and cobbles together a warmly inclusive family out of the usual ethnically correct grab bag of low-level staff. This is an inspired piece of chutzpah. Right now theres no place in America more coldly impersonal -- or more likely to prime our deepest anxieties -- than an international airport. Absurd as it is Viktors situation couldnt be more topical or more pointed about the arbitrariness of U.S. policy toward foreign nationals. The pacing of The Terminal may be as breezy as Spielbergs fetchingly cheeky caper Catch Me If You Can (though its never as stylish or as light on its feet) but its central dilemma comes closer to the bleak existential predicament of his Philip Dick-inspired Minority Report. Like Tom Cruises Detective John Anderton Viktor is a displaced person marooned in a place that isnt a place but a virtual reality. Shot in a massive hangar dressed to the last detail like a sleek airport lounge complete with tucked-away corners of dark decrepitude The Terminal perfectly captures Spielbergs ambivalent worship of capitalism. His big boys love of gadgetry is everywhere apparent in the security cameras blinking computer screens and one-way glass walls that monitor Viktors movements and turn the frighteningly lifelike set with its gleaming cookie-cutter concession stands into a full-court product-placement campaign that all but eclipses whatever message Spielberg intended about how airports turn people into commodities. ""Theres only one thing you can do here"" a sympathetic immigration officer tells him. ""Shop."" Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm Viktor doesnt know how to shop and he understands very little of what others say to him. But he does know how to make do and like a latter-day Gracie Allen he has an uncanny gift for coming up roses just by doing his own thing in his own dogged way. Trained in the hilariously hammy drag television sitcom Bosom Buddies Hanks is an imaginative physical comedian who can find a fresh way to spin even the shamelessly warmed-over shtick that Spielberg serves up scene after scene -- Viktor trying to eke out a meal out of crackers and ketchup or banging a line of conjoined airport chairs into a makeshift bed or repeatedly Xeroxing his own hand or slipping on a booby trap of a wet floor deliberately set up by an Indian maintenance man (the wonderfully deadpan Kumar Pallana late of The Royal Tenenbaums). As he grows fleshier in middle age Hanks has acquired the gravitas of Gary Cooper at once vulnerable and dependable with an edge of remote sadness. As a romantic lead though the actor has always been tranquilly unsexy a quality that stood him in good stead opposite the similarly sexless Meg Ryan in Sleepless in Seattle. Here he makes an awkwardly unpersuasive love interest for the lubricious Catherine Zeta-Jones who plays Amelia a shapely flight attendant with an unerring radar for feckless cads who recognizes that unlike her married lover Viktor can give her the stability she thinks she craves. If Spielberg has never made a convincing romance -- his one previous venture into the form was the widely (if to my mind excessively) derided 1989 flop Always -- neither is he comfortable with realism. Indeed his most fully realized characters have been larger-than-life shysters like Oskar Schindler and Catch Me If You Cans Frank Abagnale Jr. mythic figures defined as much by their demons as by their easy charm. In the end its this duality rather than the cloying folksiness of the family values that Viktor brings to the airport lounge that gives the movie some edge. The Terminal is a parable a tale of good and evil whose real fun couple is not Viktor and Amelia but Viktor and Frank Dixon whose wily scheming makes him the yin to Viktors yang. Together they are the dark and the light of the American microcosm that Spielberg creates in The Terminal. This is Spielbergs second comedy in a row and the director has been talking a lot about Hollywoods calling to bring light and warmth to dark times. In the long run though Spielberg is less likely to be remembered as an Ernst Lubitsch (in any case he lacks the psychological sophistication) than as a Frank Capra for our benighted post-9/11 war-torn times. The edge of despair that lurked behind Capras feel-good movies for children of the Depression is always there even in Spielbergs lightest fare. So it should come as no surprise that even as The Terminal resolves its troubles with a cathartic burst of patriotic sweetness and light true love slinks away with its tail between its legs.

Posted June 16 2004 -- 1200 AM EDT Even if youre scared of flying an airport can be an odd sort of comfort zone. The grayish-white plastic walls are soothing and womblike. The magazine stores and fast-food outlets the stands dispensing waxy Danish and borderline undrinkable coffee all feel a little less sterile than they might elsewhere. Theyre not just ho-hum businesses - theyre Things to Do. Regardless of who you are being in an airport always makes you feel like a bit of a kid. Yet theres a flip side. Look up at one of the monitors and discover that the flight youre on has been delayed for several hours and the comfortable numbness can turn stultifying. Suddenly the tranquil travel mall has become a prison. I experienced both of those sensations to varying degrees while watching Steven Spielbergs The Terminal a movie about a man who gets stuck at New Yorks JFK International Airport only to see the giant hub become his holding cell his purgatory and his home. After arriving at his gate Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) an eager disheveled traveler from Eastern Europe is getting ready to pass through customs when he learns that he cant go anywhere. There has been a military coup in his native (and fictional) country of Krakozhia and his passport is no longer valid. Officially hes a ""citizen of nowhere"" ordered to stay within the confines of the International Transit Lounge. Viktor who speaks fragments of English carries an old Planters peanuts tin around with him and its mystery contents we gather are connected to the reason for his journey. Will he ever make it to Manhattan - or more precisely to the Ramada Inn on Lexington Avenue? Oh the sadness the irony of it He has arrived to fulfill his dream in America and they wont even let him in. Youd think it would be a temporary problem. The snarly rule-bound security officer Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) would like to be rid of Viktor; he even tries to goad him into escaping. But Viktor is a dutiful and passive soul and he wont venture out. He remains at the airport in limbo a walking bureaucratic snafu and the hours stretch into days weeks months. Hanks throwing out fractured syllables of Krakozhian without ever quite playing his accent for cheap laughs cultivates an honorable workingmans slouch and he lowers his eyebrows into a squint of gentle perplexity. He makes Viktor into a post-Soviet Chaplinesque ""little man."" Viktor is given food vouchers which he promptly loses and he gets shunted around without any thought to his physical comfort. Yet he takes all of it in stride. Its a subliminal joke that he never gets the least bit upset or exasperated. Having been raised or so we presume within the dilapidated remnants of a joyless authoritarian land Viktor has learned to accept his lot in life and so he asks for nothing. Hes an endlessly patient potato-headed good guy - a lumpen saint with no visible anger or sexual appetite. Hes quaintly likable. Hes also a little tedious. ""The Terminal"" has a wan and precious pseudo-charm but its hard to shake the feeling that Spielberg in essence is doing what you do when you sit around an airport. Hes killing time. Theres a bare-bones castaway logic to Viktors plight. He returns stray baggage carts for the reward of a quarter apiece and he appears to hone his English by reading the ticker on TV news channels. But Spielberg working from a script by Sacha Gervasi and Jeff Nathanson (the story is by Gervasi and ""The Truman Show""s Andrew Niccol) turns Viktors stay at JFK mostly into a fish-out-of-water lark. He has made a hermetic Krakozhia on the Hudson. Viktor gets to know a coyly hostile Indian sanitation worker (Kumar Pallana) who enjoys watching people slip on freshly cleaned floors and he agrees to play Cupid for Enrique (Diego Luna) whos secretly in love with a sexy customs officer (the vibrant Zoe Saldana). Viktor also develops a chaste flirtation of his own He keeps running into Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones) a breathless flight attendant whose romantic life is a case study in doormat cluelessness. She is drawn of course to Viktors deep-down nobility yet watching this character whose vulnerable flightiness marks her as a relic of the Diane Keaton?Goldie Hawn heyday I felt as if Spielberg needed to get out more. I didnt mind ""The Terminal"" but I didnt really buy it either. Spielberg has crafted the film with a proficiency as seamless and impersonal as the setting and you may feel after a while that youre longing for your departure time.

YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Catherine Zeta-Jones Steven Spielberg Tom Hanks or Create your own Manage alerts | What is this? (CNN) -- ""The Terminal"" should have been terminated from the get-go. When youre teaming Steven Spielberg with Tom Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones expectations are justifiably high. But why these three Oscar-winning artists decided to lend their exceptional talents to a movie with such a thin wisp of a plot -- which goes absolutely nowhere -- is beyond me. The first 45 minutes or so are interesting as we learn about Hanks character and his unusual situation. Then the whole thing takes a nose dive and never recovers. Heres the fairly clever but ultimately one-note premise Hanks plays Viktor Navorski a man traveling to the United States from his fictitious homeland the Eastern European country of Krakozhia. Upon landing at New Yorks Kennedy Airport he is told a military coup has taken place in Krakozhia. His visa is canceled and his passport is now invalid until diplomatic relations can be established between the U.S. and Krakozhias new government. In effect Navorski is now a man without a country.Taking up residenceStanley Tucci (""Road to Perdition"") stars as Frank Dixon an uptight mid-level bureaucrat in charge of airport security. At first hes tolerant of Navorskis predicament unable either to allow him to leave the airport or to deport him Dixon gives Navorski free reign within the international transit lounge and even gives him food vouchers thinking that the situation will be cleared up within a few days. But as the weeks and months drag on it becomes apparent that Navorskis stay is indefinite and Dixon begins to get nasty. People are suppose to ebb and flow in ""his"" airport and heres some guy walking around in a bathrobe like he owns the place.This part of the film is engaging as Navorski -- the ultimate ""everyman"" -- tries to take up residence in the transitory almost dehumanizing environment of a large international airport. He sets up his own personal homeless shelter (in a part of the airport that is being remodeled) and makes money to buy food by returning used luggage carts at a quarter a pop. He also begins to learn English by using Fodor travel guide books one in English and one in his native language. In an effort to make Navorski illegally escape from the airport and into New York City -- where hell be someone elses problem -- Dixon begins to wage war on the hapless traveler. The passive-aggressive relationship between the two men is funny and contains a lot of dramatic tension.Painful adjustment Catherine Zeta-Jones plays a flight attendant who strikes up a relationship with Hanks character.Up to this point Hanks performance is reminiscent of a cross between his characters in ""Cast Away"" and ""Big."" Hes lost and bewildered but determined to make the best of a bad situation. But then things go sour. Navorski begins to make friends at JFK with a bunch of one-dimensional multi-ethnic stereotypes from the airports food courts shops and so forth. His biggest connection is with a flight attendant Amelia Warren played by a woefully miscast Catherine Zeta-Jones.Once the story stops focusing on Navorskis adjustments to living in an airport and his cat-and-mouse game with the relentless Dixon things go south quickly. There is just no ""there"" in the relationship between the sympathetic refugee and the beautiful but romantically challenged flight attendantTo add insult to injury another romantic subplot -- between a food service worker (Diego Luna) and a beautiful immigration officer (Zoe Saldana) -- is downright painful in its stupidity. The only thing more idiotic is the ending of this film when the mysterious contents of a can Navorski has obsessively clung to throughout his ordeal are finally revealed.While this film allegedly is not based on a real-life story in any way there is a man who has spent an extended amount of time in an airport. Since 1988 Iranian expatriate Merhan Karimi Nessari has resided in Terminal 1 of Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport. According to reports Dreamworks did give Nessari some money for the rights to his story in order to avoid possible lawsuits over the concept. Instead the filmmakers should worry about lawsuits from audience members wanting their money back.""The Terminal"" has been called ""a comic meditation on waiting.""

Tom Hanks stars as an immigrant unable to leave in a New York airport. Pic should quickly pilot its way to the helmers usual numbers for non-genre fare. Though history may regard it as more of an in-flight snack than a full-course meal Steven Spielbergs spirit-lifting ""The Terminal"" comes along at just the right moment. With cinemas currently providing little refuge from disasters both natural and manmade this buoyant optimistic fable seems to share in the late Ronald Reagans optimism for America. It does so with the help of a gifted comic ensemble led by Tom Hanks as an immigrant unable to leave in a New York City airport. Ideal counterprogramming against the seasons bombastic blockbusters pic should quickly pilot its way to the helmers usual numbers for non-genre fare. Fanciful as it sounds the premise of ""The Terminal"" is rooted in fact -- specifically the case of Iranian expatriate Merhan Karimi Nessari who has since 1988 resided in Terminal 1 of Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport. (Previously Nessaris story was the inspiration for the 1994 French pic ""Lost in Transit."") Here Hanks plays the Messari-inspired Viktor Navorski who touches down on American soil only to discover that during his flight a political coup occurred in his fictional Eastern European homeland. Informed by businesslike Homeland Security officer Frank Dixon (well played by Stanley Tucci) that he is unable to return home or to seek asylum in the U.S. until our government recognizes the new regime Viktor is ordered to stay put in the airport. Dixon reasons its only a matter of time before his virtual prisoner escapes into the Big Apple and becomes some other agencys problem. But Viktor wants to enter the U.S. legally for unspecified reasons that may concern the tin of Planters peanuts he carries around like a family heirloom. Restricted to the confines of the airports glittering glass-and-steel international transit area Viktor patiently goes about making himself a home while the film evolves into a gentle satire of the dilemmas of immigration and the resilience of this new Americans entrepreneurial spirit. Because Viktor is depicted in these early passages as barely speaking a word of English Hanks Viktor becomes something of a silent observer bemusedly soaking up the spectacle of harried travelers. Performance resonates with an underplayed deadpan grace closer to Hanks solo scenes in ""Cast Away"" than to his broadly comic turn in the Coen Brothers ""Ladykillers"" remake. Yet the role also affords the actor some of the best opportunities for physical comedy that hes had since ""Big"" and he pulls them off with unselfconscious ease. Even Viktors thick vaguely Russian accent hardly seems a distraction precisely because he doesnt say very much. Screenplay slyly observes the terminal as a home to an entire community of uprooted persons -- from Indian emigre janitor Gupta (scene-stealing Wes Anderson regular Kumar Pallana) who takes perverse pleasure in watching people slip across his freshly-waxed floors to Mexican food-service worker Enrique (Diego Luna) who pines for the affections of a beautiful Customs officer (Zoe Saldana). Theres also knockout United Airlines flight attendant Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones) whose meet-cute with Viktor owes itself to a waxy Gupta-generated tumble. Embroiled in an unsatisfying affair with a married man (Michael Nouri) she finds herself drawn to Viktors honesty and warmth and able to relate to his feeling of living in an airport (which she initially mistakes as a metaphor). Yet while Viktor and Amelia continue to rendezvous their relationship becomes neither the focal point of ""The Terminal"" nor a full-blown romance. And while Zeta-Jones is excellent at revealing Amelias sad delicate dimensions she ultimately isnt in that much of the movie. Of course thats part of pics point -- that in this crazy mixed-up world we rarely have time to stop and savor the things that really matter. For a movie about a man whose very nationality lingers in limbo for months ""The Terminal"" lacks any significant sense of conflict and an 11th-hour subplot involving Art Kanes famous Harlem jazz portrait feels like something out of left field. But at its best ""The Terminal"" finds Spielberg working in the breezy freewheeling fashion that dates back to his early ""The Sugarland Express"" and his recent ""Catch Me if You Can."" Spielberg does not appear to take himself or the material too seriously and his steadfast refusal to see the proverbial glass as less than half-full is more inspiring than cloying. In Spielbergs world its possible for an immigrant to learn fluent English by reading a Fodors travel guide. And in a summer when the likes of ""Troy"" and ""The Stepford Wives"" are what pass for old-fashioned Hollywood entertainment its a pleasure to spend time there. Astonishingly pics massive detail-perfect set is just that -- not a real airport terminal at all but an exact replica constructed by production designer Alex McDowell in a Palmdale Calif. aerospace hanger. (A few exteriors were shot in Montreal.) Though relatively minor compared to his superb work on the new ""Harry Potter"" pic John Williams score still offers an enjoyable coupling of typically Holst-ian fanfares and more adventurous klezmer-influenced riffs. Perhaps pics greatest technical pleasure however is the lustrous color-saturated cinematography of regular Spielberg lenser Janusz Kaminski whose work here registers at the opposite end of the spectrum from his signature faded hues and blown-out lighting schemes resulting in a visual luxuriance that harks back to Spielbergs classic collaborations with d.p. Allen Daviau (""E.T."" ""The Color Purple"" ""Empire of the Sun""). The TerminalProductionA DreamWorks release and presentation from Amblin Entertainment of a Parkes/MacDonald production.
