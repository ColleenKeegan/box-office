Find out whats happening in the world as it unfolds.Giovanni Ribisi Josh Brolin Ryan Gosling Anthony Mackie Michael Pena and Robert Patrick in ""Gangster Squad."" Story highlightsJosh Brolin Sean Penn Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone star in ""Gangster Squad""The film is inspired by Paul Liebermans series for the Los Angeles TimesCritic says Brolin Gosling buddy dynamic never snaps into placeAfter the Denver shootings during a showing of ""Dark Knight Rises"" Warner Bros. swiftly withdrew the trailer of ""Gangster Squad"" from before the Nolan film and reportedly removed a sequence in which gangsters shoot up a movie theater from behind the screen. Now ""Gangster Squad"" emerges just a month after the Newtown killings a titillating but anodyne piece of gun glamour for the masses.Inspired by Paul Liebermans series for the Los Angeles Times ""Tales from the Gangster Squad"" the movie ducks the obvious comparisons with ""LA Confidential"" ""Mulholland Falls"" and ""Bugsy"" by opting for a pulpy vibe and poppy comic book visuals.This is no ""Chinatown"" exercise in history as neo-noir and its sure no James Ellroy-style take down of the LAPD (the controversial 1950s Police Chief William Parker -- played by Nick Nolte - gets a free pass for instigating what amounts to a vigilante hit-squad operating beyond any legal jurisdiction).Rather its a gleaming glossy parade of good-looking actors trading quips and striking poses in sexy period duds only a couple of stops more naturalistic than ""Sin City"" or ""Dick Tracy."" And its Beattys film that comes to mind most immediately with Sean Penn channeling a snarling Al Pacino (and showing off a striking prosthetic nose) as ambitious LA racketeer Mickey Cohen an all purpose bad guy who orders a Chicago rival to be chained to two autos and ripped in half in the films first minute.JUST WATCHEDConan Mackie is BFF with GoslingReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHConan Mackie is BFF with Gosling 0010Within another 60 seconds Josh Brolins square-jawed Sgt. OMara has established his impeccable heroic credentials by crashing one of Cohens brothels shooting or beating up five of his henchmen and rescuing an innocent dame from a fate worse than death -- all to the consternation of his immediate superiors but impressing the heck out of Chief Parker.""Dont make arrests"" Parker growls. ""This is occupied territory. Wage guerrilla warfare.""For a spell the movie corrects to an engagingly fizzy tone. OMaras shrewd and pregnant wife (the excellent Mireille Enos) handpicks his squad. Theres a sharpshooter nicknamed ""Cowboy"" she read about in True Detective magazine (Robert Patrick); a brainiac who knows how to set up a wiretap (Giovanni Ribisi). Anachronistically for Parkers LAPD theres also an African-American who is handy with a knife (Anthony Mackie) and a Latino who muscles in on the action (Michael Pena).Their first intervention is deliciously botched. And then theyre faced with getting out of Burbank alive. For all its historical liberties the movie does have fun re-creating mid-century Los Angeles.Last to sign up is Ryan Goslings Sgt. Jerry Wooters an easygoing womanizer who happens to be sleeping with Mickey Cohens girl (Emma Stone doing a very passable Bacall) and whose less rigid approach to the job is meant to color our admiration for OMaras righteousness.But the more seriously ""Zombieland"" director Ruben Fleischer takes the material the more vapid it comes off. Some glaring gaps in third act story logic dont help but the whole Gosling and Brolin dynamic never really snaps into place. Are they old war buddies? You can believe Brolin has seen some action but Gosling just comes off as wet behind the ears -- theres no rapport between them and no real reason to care when things go sour.""Gangster Squad"" looks the part but its so superficial it practically evaporates before our eyes.Powered by LivefyreHomeU.S.Crime + JusticeEnergy + EnvironmentExtreme WeatherSpace + ScienceWorldAfricaAmericasAsiaEuropeMiddle East2016 ElectionWashingtonNationWorldMarketsTechMediaPersonal FinanceLuxuryOpinionPolitical Op-EdsSocial CommentaryHealthDiet + FitnessLiving WellParenting + FamilyEntertainmentCelebrity WatchTV + WebMovies + MusicTechGadgetsCyber SecurityInnovation NationFashionDesignArchitectureAutosLuxuryTravelBest of TravelSleeps + EatsBusiness TravelAviation + BeyondPro FootballCollege FootballBasketballBaseballSoccerLivingFoodRelationshipsReligionVideoLive TV Digital StudiosCNN FilmsTV ScheduleTV Shows A-ZMore...PhotosLongformInvestigationsiReportCNN profilesCNN LeadershipCNN NewslettersU.S. EditionSet edition preferenceU.S.InternationalConfirmU.S.InternationalArabicEspanol(c) 2016 Cable News Network.

John OMara in ""Gangster Squad"" in which a lawful squad uses gang-like tactics against the mob.

Grenades and thug-styled dismemberments. Ambushes and even more deceptive guerrilla maneuvers. Killing him softly by lying straight to his face; killing him loudly by publicly stealing his girlfriend and turning her against him. You might say the new shoot-em-up film ""Gangster Squad"" fights the good fight. And the whole film is just that one big fight -- for the soul of Los Angeles in 1949 when mob boss Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) is making a move to take over the entire western United States from his Chicago brethren. War hero John OMara (Josh Brolin) is back from the front lines with two Purple Hearts and more but his straightforwardly moral police work is getting him in trouble with the Los Angeles forces powers that be most of whom are in the mob boss pocket. When OMara gets a classified mission from police chief ""Whiskey Bill"" Parker (Nick Nolte) to assemble a squad to fight Cohen and his gangsters with gang-like tactics he jumps at the opportunity to save the city. In comes Jerry (Ryan Gosling) a free-wheeling detective whos already found romance with Grace (Emma Stone) who also happens to be dating mob boss Cohen. The others in the squad bring a variety of personalities specialties and thankfully ethnicities to the mix. (Giovanni Ribisi gives the brainy Conwell a heart while Robert Patricks character Max is responsible for some of the films best laughs. Maxs sidekick Navidad played by Michael Pena steps into a supporting role poignantly.) In fact think of this motley crew as precursors to those sly foxes in the ""Oceans Eleven"" movies. With that comparison its easy to think of ""Gangster Squad"" as a slick espionage exercise. But its actually more of a Western than anything else. Sure theyre attempting to undercut Cohens massive ring which includes drugs gambling and nightclubs. But its never very slick or easy. It was a smart writing choice to have the squads first encounter with Cohens business end up with two of the good (and undercover) guys in jail. The squad boys were working with a bare-bones crew and Cohen owned the city of Burbank -- and all of its officers. So let them try to trash the casino fail and land in jail -- and allow a jailbreak scene to unfold that is both smart and funny. But what happens when you cant tell the good guys from the bad guys? ""War taught us how to fight"" Brolins OMara says more than halfway through the film. ""And God knows it was worth it. But now its all I know how to do."" The film is surprisingly stylized -- with lots of smoky gunfire and slow-motion explosions. It cant help but look ultra-modern with all that fancy camera work but it never loses its footing in the 40s giving it a strangely unique perspective. Brolin plays his detective as straight as they come and it works -- especially since Goslings tender emotional cop carries the other end of the spectrum. Stones stark throwback beauty looks stunning in costume and on camera but shes a bit part here to the actual squad. But dare we say this is Penns film? Without Penns ferocious Mickey the film would lack any real contrast -- or life even. While Brolin plays his role as seriously as Christian Bales Batman Penn is the evil-eyed hate-mongering villain Heath Ledger accomplished as the Joker. It might sound like a stretch imagining Penn playing that intense indiosyncratic a villain. But the lauded veteran actor pulls a left hook then a right and after a wild bodyshot at the tail end of the film you see the true mania behind his eyes.

Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of 2012 movies 10 to look for Video Gangster Squad trailer Monitor Movie Guide ""Gangster Squad"" is a deliberately retro crime thriller about the rise and fall of Los Angeles mobster Mickey Cohen played by Sean Penn with such twisted relish that at times he resembles a gargoyle - or maybe Gollum. Penn is always entertaining when hes playing characters drunk with depravity. ""Gangster Squad"" could use more of him despite a top-drawer cast that includes Josh Brolin Ryan Gosling Emma Stone Nick Nolte Michael Pena Giovanni Ribisi and Anthony Mackie.Most of them are wasted (especially Pena) in subpar bang-bang theatrics that look like discards from ""L.A. Confidential"" or ""The Untouchables."" Brolins character heads up the titular squad to rid the city of Mickey and the Mafia. Director Ruben Fleischer and screenwriter Will Beall cant decide whether to make a spoof or a serious drama so they wrongheadedly attempt both. Grade C (Rated R for strong violence and language.)

Loved it. Entertaining and the good guys win and the bad guys get beat- really beat -). When I want a movie I want a good time amp; a happy ending. Thats it. If you want drama and depression and Cannes or Sundance simply skip fun movies like this one. A+ M.E. (Cadillac) Lealiesaid on Friday February 22 2013 114215 AMI Love you like Garrett popcorn Richard but this film was lame. It is a gorgeous looking film but just a corny reboot of the 1987 classic The Untouchables. Penn does a good job but it is a dry film with no purpose. Cheers  ken carlsonsaid on Wednesday January 23 2013 61955 AMAgree with earlier writer you were not observing how offensive this movie was. A ""D+"" not a ""B+"" was warranted. Dustinsaid on Monday January 21 2013 123010 PMRichard I heard you on Howard Stern and you are the man Steven Freekinsaid on Monday January 21 2013 115836 AMFrom the 1st trailer i realized that this film was either going to be very stupid or very mediocre. After seeing the movie this weekend i give it a C-. The story is so basic that anyone can sleep through it and still figure out exactly what happened; it was all in the trailer. However some of the cast did deliver some good performances exciting action sequences and some comic relief. In the end i was expecting too much from this movie but it only deliver want it intended to deliver and that is style and entertainment. Eric A.said on Saturday January 12 2013 23048 PMB+??? B+?? Youre my most trusted critic but youre totally wrong here. This garbage is cliched trite poorly written and over the top. Mattsaid on Saturday January 12 2013 20407 PMYoure the worst movie reviewer in America. I say movie reviewer because associating you with the word critic lowers the concept of criticism. Reply from Richard Roeper Dear Matt Thanks for visiting the site All the best Richard robin pattonsaid on Saturday January 12 2013 14238 PMAny movie whos content or release date is compromised by the news of the day or political atmosphere does neither the writer director or the movie going public any positive service. This is censorship whether its done by the studios or the government. Ron Burgesssaid on Friday January 11 2013 115650 PMI agree. This is a well-crafted action movie. I feel like many of the other critics are dismissing this movie because of its similarities to ""The Untouchables"" and ""L.A. Confidential"" instead of judging it on its own merits. Keep up the good work Joelsaid on Friday January 11 2013 73026 PMHey Richard I have yet to see the movie but was excited to see it until I checked out Rotten Tomatoes which feature less than positive reviews from most Top Critics on the site. I was wondering since you do this professionally why you believe that this movie was given such negative reviews compared to yours. My movie tastes seem to fall more in line with yours and I understand this is kind of a strange question and I know you cannot speak for anyone else but I was just curious if you had any insight.

Despite a cast of gifted actors lush 1940s production design and suave costumes its bereft of inspiration plowing familiar terrain past the point of tedium to impatience. It aspires to be this years ""Untouchables."" Its closer to unwatchable. The setting in Los Angeles a few years after World War II as mob tyrant Mickey Cohen builds a West Coast crime empire on drugs prostitution and gambling. Sean Penn virtually skulks through the role quoting Bela Lugosi from ""Dracula"" before knocking off one interloper. With top cops judges and politicians on the take Cohen is essentially above the law. He sees ownership of the city as his manifest destiny taking it from the citizens the way their forefathers took it from the Indians. That doesnt sit well with Sgt. John OMara (Josh Brolin) a two-fisted vet willing to go vigilante when the situation demands. Which it does early in the film as OMara stages a one-man assault on a heavily fortified whorehouse to rescue a kidnapped damsel. The scene is inventively staged and effectively establishes OMaras act-first think-later style. OMara is tapped by the chief of police gravel-gargling Nick Nolte to form a secret team of honest cops who will take on Cohen unhindered by legal constraints. In a clever sequence OMaras wife Connie (winningly played by likable Mireille Enos) helps her thick-skulled hubby with his homework choosing a team that will get the job done while protecting him. This housewife could have had a great career in the police force if she had been born a few decades later. Alas after this promising start inspiration leaks from the project. Brolins team includes Ryan Gosling as a world-weary wolf brainiac Giovanni Ribisi sixgun-packin old timer Robert Patrick his Latino sidekick Michael Pena and knife-wielding street cop Anthony Mackie. Gosling dallies dangerously with Cohens moll husky-voiced Emma Stone costumed in full Jessica Rabbit sexbomb regalia. Their relationship gives the pair one-and-a-half dimensions which is approximately four times the depth screenwriter Will Beal allows the other characters. Warner Bros. Wilson Webb Giovanni Ribisi Josh Brolin Ryan Gosling Anthony Mackie Michael Pena and Robert Patrick are the ""Gangster Squad."" The squad comically fumbles its first raid on a gambling hall but soon is ventilating antique cars Los Angeles landmarks and stunt men with flaring machine guns. As the film devolves into a stale series of shootouts your response isnt an eager ""I wonder what theyll do this time?"" but a weary ""Here we go again."" Theres not much sense of danger in these spectacles. The only supporting character who dies is exactly the one the Screenwriters Playbook requires. Anyone with knowledge of L.A. history will find the story so wildly inaccurate as to be almost entertaining. At the fade-out the narrator proudly assures us that the mob never re-established a foothold in the City of Angels. True but the Latino street gangs are worse and the LAPD is no bargain either. Maybe they were kidding.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jan. 11 2013 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Jan. 11 2013 1111AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Ruben Fleischer Written by Will Beall Paul Lieberman Starring Ryan Gosling Sean Penn Josh Brolin Classification 14A Genre drama Year 2013 Country USA Language English So a pretty good cast - Sean Penn Ryan Gosling Josh Brolin and Emma Stone among them - heads out in search of a movie. That they dont find one is hardly their fault. Gangster Squad is to the great tradition of the Scarface genre what plastic is to cutlery - tiny imitative disposable. Their search thwarted the actors are left with little to do but play dress-up the guys in pinstripes and fedoras the gals in satin and lace. Its 1949 you see in the City of Angels. The irony is worth noting Back when it was really 1949 Hollywood made noir with teeth; this is nougat with pretensions. Screen grab from an online trailer for ""Gangster Squad"" Movies Gangster Squad The official trailer The sweet pretense is clear from the opening frames when Mickey Cohen (Penn) aided by a set of chains and a pair of cars pulling in opposite directions treats a rival gangster like a human wishbone. Snap goes his bisected torso. Not to worry though - its all faux gruesome. Only our giggles are real. Surveying the wishbones remains Penn squints his eyes and pugs his nose and starts his film-long feast chewing the scenery. Then again with a script so thin a guys gotta find nourishment somewhere.Meanwhile Sgt. John (Brolin) is busy rescuing a damsel in distress a feat that brings him to the attention of the harried police chief and ushers in the alleged based-on-a-true-story premise assemble a band of Untouchables to ""drive that bastard out of the city."" Said bastard being Mickey of course who not only owns Slapsy Maxies - an art deco emporium where swells swill booze while chanteuses with fruit on their head sing bouncy Latin tunes - but is poised to overrun the entire burgh.Keen to get on with the bastard-excising business Sgt. John is quick to recruit Sgt. Jerry (Gosling) the single and cynical playboy to the others married idealist. We know Sgt. Jerry is a playboy because the first thing out of his mouth as he waltzes all pinstriped and fedoraed into Slapsy Maxies is ""Whos that tomato?"" Not to be outdone in the argot department the satined and laced tomato (Stone) replies in interrogative kind ""Whats your racket handsome?"" Well after such a meeting of the minds it will come as no surprise that the tomato graduates from Mickeys moll to Goslings girl. At this point savvy cinephiles will recall that back in Crazy Stupid Love Gosling and Stone generated some major chemistry. But this time for reasons perhaps best known to them they cant even light their Bunsen burner.A few recruits later - the brainy one the sharpshooter the ""Mexican kid"" - the squad gets down and dirty busting up Mickeys gambling dens and disrupting his drug trade and even running riot in Slapsy Maxies. Oh theyre a machine-gun blazing bunch so ferocious that one of their number worries aloud ""Can you remind me of the difference between them and us."" Actually no need. ""Them"" is bad and chows down on the scenery; ""us"" wears halos and the goodness shines through.Taking an ostensible break from comedy (30 Minutes or Less Zombieland) Ruben Fleischer directs the action with a similarly angelic touch. The car chases the punch-ups the shootouts - seldom has the church of mayhem radiated such sweetness and light. Even a trip to Chinatown so gloomy when Roman Polanski visited comes with bright sparklers and colourful flags and bustling vendors hawking their wares. Add egg rolls and a blanket and it could be a picnic - yep where plastic cutlery is just the ticket.

(WARNER BROS.) They are a family man a playboy a Latino a black man a cowboy and a nerd. But they are the most dangerous cops in the city because theyre the ones that cant be bought. And now theyve put their badges away risking their lives to go after the wickedest gangster in town. Why? Well you know ""all thats necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing"" one hero quotes. They are the Gangster Squad. And so is their movie and if it were any cornier you could pop it on your stove and drizzle it with butter. The film which stars a jut-jawed Josh Brolin was supposed to come out last year. But that version featured a shootout in a movie theater and after the Aurora massacre that was impossible. The film was pulled re-edited and revised. Its hard to imagine its been improved. Although the story claims to be based on fact that basis is more than a little wobbly as it imagines a famous murder case involving oldtime L.A. mob boss Mickey Cohen. Not true. Any resemblance to history here is restricted to some snazzy spectator shoes and cans of Schlitz beer. Instead we get Brolin who looks like a Sunday comic-strip hero and Ryan Gosling all bedroom eyes as his lothario friend. And we get gun battles that are so over-the-top - the gangsters not only have submachine guns they fire them two at a time - we might as well be back at Anzio. But if this side of the film is faintly ridiculous the rest is just overly familiar. Post-war Los Angeles half-true bits of pop gossip and brutally righteous cops beating suspects half to death -- this is Ellroy land already explored at length in ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""The Black Dahlia."" Its also been the source of any number of other modern noirs including the good mostly forgotten ""Mulholland Falls"" from the mid-`90s. Curiously that film had Nick Nolte as the detective hero; by now hes aged into playing the chief of police and grown so massively immobile he resembles a talking boulder. Nolte is still fun to see and the cast is often lively. Particularly energetic is Sean Penn as Cohen even if the scar-tissue makeup makes him look like a Dick Tracy villain. Too bad the script does little to capture Cohens weird charisma (a proto-Gotti publicity hound he was a favorite of the tabloids as well as of some famously loyal strippers). If Cohens underwritten though the female characters are nonexistent. Good girl Mireille Enos looks merely maternal as Brolins wife; bad girl Emma Stone as Cohens moll looks like a teenager playing dressup. Shes both out of her depth and badly used in a film which ignores her wit and nerve. Instead director Ruben Fleischer - who had a comic hit with ""Zombieland"" and a pretty mad misfire with ""30 Minutes or Less"" - saves all his attention for the violence. Some scenes - like a free-for-all lit by strobe-like flashes of gunfire - are inventive. Most are merely excessive until the whole thing concludes in a noisy urban bloodbath. In real life the pudgy balding Cohen - almost 20 years past his brief career as a minor prizefighter -- let his minions handle the rough stuff while he posed for the papers. And in the end it wasnt the cops who got him but the feds. Two stints for tax fraud pretty much broke him and he died in his sleep a relic. Of course movies about fat old men getting caught by clever accountants arent exactly a recipe for box-office success. But neither are flatfooted retreads like this. Ratings note The film contains gory violence strong language sexual situations and alcohol abuse. Gangster Squad (R) Warner Bros. (113 min.) Directed by Ruben Fleischer.

Photo Wilson Webb Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are hot but barely believable in ""Gangster Squad."" (Wilson Webb) A great cast -- headed by Josh Brolin Ryan Gosling Sean Penn and Emma Stone -- is dressed to kill but shooting blanks in Ruben Fleischers ""Gangster Squad a cartoonish 1940s shoot-em-up thats impossible to take seriously. This flick is said to be based on a ""true story"" -- from a well-researched book by Paul Lieberman (who full disclosure I worked with 30 years ago in New Jersey). But Fleischer and the credited screenwriter Will Beall play very fast and loose with the facts. The true inspiration for ""Gangster Squad -- like so many other period films these days -- is actually other movies principally Brian De Palmas ""The Untouchables which was written by David Mamet. Unfortunately Fleischer (""Zombieland) and Beall (a former LAPD detective-turned-novelist) take their material much less seriously than De Palma or Curtis Hanson (""L.A. Confidential). The setting is 1949 Los Angeles -- kudos to production designer Maher Ahmad and cinematographer Dion Beebe though there are far too many images that have clearly been digitally tweaked to within an inch of their lives as well as props and costumes that have obviously been freshly manufactured for the occasion. The City of Angels has become a criminal empire ruled by Mickey Cohen (a heavily made-up Penn) a flamboyant former featherweight boxer-turned-Jewish-Mafioso from Brooklyn and associate of the late Bugsy Siegel (and far better played by Harvey Keitel in Barry Levinsons ""Bugsy). Cohen has put much of the LAPD and the citys judiciary on his payroll as he prepared to corner the West Coast market on bookmaking and heroin. So Police Chief William Parker (a self-parodying Nick Nolte) sends for Sergeant John OMara (Brolin) an insubordinate but straight-arrow detective and World War II veteran who took it upon himself to bust up one of Cohens brothels. OMara is tasked with recruiting a small squad of misfits to wage war on Cohens machine while ignoring such legal niceties as search and arrest warrants. His men include an expert in illegal wiretaps (Giovanni Ribisi) who frets the squads methods are not that different from Cohens a retired sure-shot (Robert Patrick) and improbably for an elite squad of the era token black (Anthony Mackie) and Latino (Michael Pena) officers. The most important and reluctant (until his favorite shoeshine boy is snuffed by Cohens men) addition to the squad is Sergeant Jerry Wooters (Gosling) a smug nattily dressed skirt-chasing detective with military experience whose latest conquest is Cohens mistress Grace Faraday (Stone). You might reasonably ask why Wooters would accept an assignment that could very well land his part-time girlfriend in cement shoes but this is the sort of movie in which such questions are cheerfully waved away. And where cops guarding a shot-up home somehow fail to notice survivors cowering in the bathtub. Indeed director Fleischer seems less interested in the Gangster Squads exploits as an opportunity to tell a coherent involving story -- he often allows (encourages?) his cast especially Penn to egregiously overact their wafer-thin characters and spout risible dialogue -- than provide a jokey excuse for elaborate set pieces that make little narrative sense. Like the opening scene where Penn -- looking alarmingly like Al Pacino in Warren Beattys ""Dick Tracy -- has a rival mobster chained to a pair of cars and pulled apart behind the famous Hollywoodland sign. (The last four letters were later removed.) A shootout in a Hollywood hotel lobby is modeled on the train-station sequence in ""The Untouchables but Fleischer lacks De Palmas instincts for such subtleties as camera placement and editing so it quickly devolves into tedium. ""The Gangster Squad earned notoriety in July when its trailer showing a climactic shootout at Graumans Chinese Theatre was pulled following the Aurora Colo. movie-theater massacre. The planned September opening was delayed so the offending sequence could be replaced with a newly shot ambush -- thats as gratuitously violent as it is nonsensical. And its in LAs Chinatown Jake.

Pictures release. Photo Wilson Webb Warner Bros. Pictures Gangster Squad review Violent action 1 / 5 Back to Gallery Gangster Squad Crime action drama. Starring Josh Brolin Ryan Gosling Sean Penn and Emma Stone. Directed by Ruben Fleischer. (R. 113 minutes.) Imagine its 1949 and youre a cop and you get the assignment to form a vigilante squad of five or six men to bring down the empire of the biggest gangster in Los Angeles Mickey Cohen. What would you do? One obvious strategy would be sabotage. Find his assets go there after hours and start blowing things up. Keeping your identities secret would be essential so you wouldnt do anything out in the open. And with only six guys you would never walk into one of his establishments with revolvers and shoot it out against 20 gangsters with machine guns. That would be stupid wouldnt it? And yet that is precisely what the cops in ""Gangster Squad"" keep doing so they must be stupid and the filmmakers must expect us not to notice. Heres the problem A movie like this - set in the film noir days of postwar Los Angeles - gains a lot from its historical authenticity (or even the illusion of it). But by the second or third time the gangster squad provokes some insane public gunfight with Cohens army you catch on that youre not seeing something real or almost real but an attempt to ramp up an old story for maximum action. With that realization goes the illusion of this movies integrity. Whats left is nothing terrible just typical. We first meet the villain as he snarls into the camera and the narrator tells us this is Mickey Cohen - as everyone in the audience thinks ""No actually thats Sean Penn."" This is the challenge any well-known actor assumes when he takes on a character role but Penn provides so much psychological detail that Cohen becomes fascinating - evil to the point of demonic but also tense bitter resentful bottled up and strange. Penn succeeds in this despite a script that has him acting like a one-note James Bond villain. On three occasions an underling screws something up and apologizes and Cohen accepts the apology and then immediately has the person killed. In the funniest example (but was it intended to be funny?) he says to his henchmen ""You know the drill."" Whereupon a huge drill is produced and blood is sprayed everywhere. Its something out of ""Monty Python."" Were to assume that drills are kept in every room just in case he chooses to use that expression. By now you might have inferred that ""Gangster Squad"" is an exceedingly violent movie from an early scene in which a man is chained to two cars and torn in half to the climactic machine-gun battle at a hotel. The film was scheduled to open in September but following the mass killings in Aurora Colo. a scene depicting people getting machine gunned inside a movie theater had to be cut and reshot. Now the machine guns are in Chinatown. Director Ruben Fleischer leans hard on the violence card but with little return in the way of excitement and at the expense of character and story. Josh Brolin plays the leader of the gangster squad as a kind of dedicated dunce which is appropriate considering their clumsy antics. Ryan Gosling has more nuance as his right-hand man but Emma Stone is completely out of her element as a slinky film noir heroine a walking anachronism. Speaking of anachronisms at one point Stone stands up from her table at a nightclub and says ""I think Ill have a cigarette"" and in another scene a gangster is shown smoking on a balcony. Historical footnote Until around 1980 people actually went inside to smoke and outside to breathe. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Starring Sean Penn Ryan Gosling Josh Brolin Nick Nolte Robert Patrick Michael Pena Giovanni Ribisi Anthony Mackie Emma Stone Director Ruben Fleischer Running time 153 Release Opened Jan 11 2013  Editorial Review Boys toys and colorful violenceBy Ann HornadayFriday January 11 2013Slick sick self-consciously stylish and defiantly shallow ""Gangster Squad"" is one of those movies you cant talk about without invoking other (often better) movies. A lot of movies. ""L.A. Confidential."" ""The Untouchables."" ""Chinatown."" ""Bugsy."" ""Dick Tracy."" ""The Magnificent Seven."" ""Rampart"" (with an asterisk). Those are just a few of the films liberally quoted in Ruben Fleischers attractive but tediously derivative post-war crime drama. Even Michael Manns cheesy-looking ""Public Enemies"" gets its due in the digitally filmed ""Gangster Squad"" which is so poorly lit during its climactic sequences that it resembles bad daytime television. The action opens in 1949 when a pathological crime boss named Mickey Cohen -- played by a prosthetic-schnozzed Sean Penn serving an over-salted slab of pure ham -- is running Los Angeless brothels drug trade and police department with sadistic fury. (We meet Cohen just as hes halving an opponent for dinner and no thats not a typo the dinner is for a couple of coyotes.) One of the few cops Cohen hasnt bought is John OMara (Josh Brolin) a straight shooter and World War II hero with a pregnant wife at home and a yen for fighting the good fight. When OMara is enlisted by police chief William Parker (Nick Nolte) to go off the books to wipe Cohen out the square-jawed vet enlists a ragtag team of misfits (played by Anthony Mackie Michael Pena Giovanni Ribisi and Robert Patrick) that could have stepped out of any war picture ""Gangster Squad"" continually references. The most interesting of the vigilantes is Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling) who early in the film becomes entangled with Cohens main squeeze a creamy Jessica Rabbit-esque bombshell named Grace. Lucky for viewers that Grace is played by the sensational Emma Stone giving them a chance once again to luxuriate in the chemistry she and Gosling can generate in just one smoldering glance. Lucky too that Fleischer has cast ""The Killings"" Mireille Enos as OMaras spirited wife Connie who as channeled through Enoss naturalism and warmth cuts right through her husbands macho posturing. But really ""Gangster Squad"" is all about macho posturing -- or more accurately boys and their toys which in this case include guns cars fedoras more guns cigarettes studied nonchalance and women cosmeticized coiffed and costumed to look like hard-edged china dolls. As an exercise in fetish worship ""Gangster Squad"" trafficks in the same glib violence and excess as Quentin Tarantinos ""Django Unchained."" But unlike ""Django"" -- which uses spaghetti western clichs to engage in an audacious but improbably potent interrogation of slavery -- ""Gangster Squad"" doesnt have an idea in its pretty little head. This is doubly disappointing because Fleischer made such a fiendishly clever directorial debut with the genre send-up ""Zombieland"" and because the real-life origins of ""Gangster Squad"" provide him and screenwriter Will Beall with such a potentially fruitful subtext. In a blink-and-youll-miss it moment Parker introduces his driver Daryl Gates who alert viewers know will go on to become L.A.s police captain during some of its most contentious years. But rather than explore the roots of the LAPDs later corruption in ""Gangster Squad"" the filmmakers structure the movie as a conventional -- if often cartoonishly ludicrous -- heros tale the eye-for-a-blackened-eye brutality portrayed as the good guys winning by any means necessary. Its fascinating that ""Gangster Squad"" is opening the same day as ""Zero Dark Thirty"" a film that has been speciously accused of endorsing torture in the search for Osama bin Laden. With its high-gloss sheen hardboiled timbre and love of slow-motion shootouts its actually ""Gangster Squad"" that -- in the words of one of its characters -- blithely celebrates the bright boys who shoot their way to the top of their class. ""Gangster Squad"" may earn a gentlemans C for style but the moral of the story gets a failing grade.Contains strong violence and profanity.

"Gangster Squad (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Gangster Squad (R) Shooting em up and dumbing it down Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling star in Gangster Squad Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle | cogleMiamiHerald.com1/10/2013 Editor rating 2 Gangster Squad is The Untouchables moved west and cheesed up -- apparently by filmmakers with few original thoughts in their heads. Its a derivative cartoon thats oddly entertaining although it seems to want credit for regurgitating every gangster movie cliche. Writing lines about the ""war for the soul of Los Angeles"" having sharply dressed detectives shout ""Hold on to your hats"" and referring to attractive young women as ""tomatoes"" is not the sort of work that earns Best Adapted Screenplay nominations (Gangster Squad is ""inspired"" by a book by Paul Lieberman). Its the cinematic equivalent of Bon Jovis You Give Love a Bad Name You know in your heart its a crappy song and every wince-inducing line is an affront to your intelligence but hey its on the radio so you turn up the volume and sing along anyway. At least Gangster Squad originally slated for release last fall and pushed back after the theater shootings in Aurora Colo. doesnt take itself too seriously even if most of the actors play their roles earnestly. Its cheerfully ham-handed even when people are getting Tommy-gunned to pieces or set afire or garroted or chained to cars and pulled apart (the squeamish are going to want to close their eyes for the gruesome opening scene). Theres no emotional cost to any of the violence -- its just for fun. Remember when Quentin Tarantino was always being accused of using violence for laughs back before Inglourious Basterds? Gangster Squad pulls out the same trick without Tarantinos cleverness and it feels a little outdated. Set in glamorous postwar Los Angeles the movie follows the attempts of straight-arrow Sgt. John OMara (Josh Brolin) and his team of outlaw cops to drive mobster Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) out of business. Tasked by the police chief (Nick Nolte) to take back the city -- the politics in this L.A. are slightly less believable than those in Gotham City -- they have license to kill. There are no women in the group naturally because its 1949 so women are either wives or whores; you can tell by how much lipstick they wear. The action consists mainly of men shooting at each other and missing a lot and theres a fair amount of chatter about what we fought for in the war (apparently it wasnt brothels bookmaking or anything else Mickey Cohen touches). You know this group better than you know your family. Theres a crusty old-timer (Robert Patrick); the brains of the operation (Giovanni Ribisi) who plants a bug in Mickeys mansion so effortlessly you really have to wonder about the mobsters security detail; the ethnic cops nobody else wants to work with (Anthony Mackie and Michael Pena) who are loyal and true. Jerry (Ryan Gosling) is not surprisingly the Lothario of the bunch and hes brave and foolish enough to hop into bed with Mickey Cohens girlfriend Grace (Emma Stone who is not now and never will be a tomato). Gosling and Stone worked together so well in the comedy Crazy Stupid Love that the filmmakers must have jumped at the chance to throw them together again but Stone is badly miscast. Requiring her to play a bimbo who rose through the mob kings brothels but is so dumb she cant figure out how to get out of town by herself is a colossal mistake. And then there is the menacing Penn hammy and scowling and slugging it out in a way that makes DeNiros Capone look restrained. But really theres no way to be subtle when your dialogue consists of bellowing ""I AM progress"" or ""Los Angeles is my destiny"" But why should he be anything but grandiose? Loud brash and utterly ridiculous Gangster Squad isnt about doing whats right -- its all about stylish excess. Cast Sean Penn Ryan Gosling Emma Stone Josh Brolin Nick Nolte Anthony Mackie Giovanni Ribisi Robert Patrick Michael Pena Mireille Enos. Director Ruben Fleischer. Screenwriter Will Beale. Based on the book by Paul Lieberman. Producers Dan Lin Kevin McCormick Michael Tadriss. A Warner Bros. release. Running time 113 minutes. Strong violence language. Playing at area theaters.

A misguided one. -- Michael PhillipsRead the full ""Gangster Squad"" movie review Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune A triumph of production design but a pretty dull kill-em-up otherwise the post-World War II-set ""Gangster Squad"" comes from the director of ""Zombieland"" Ruben Fleischer. Its clear Fleischer who also made ""30 Minutes or Less"" hadnt worked through his ""Zombieland"" jones by the time he got to his latest film. I liked ""Zombieland"" which made a strong case for its brand of viscera and wisecracks. But ""Gangster Squad"" is a different sort of picture or should be.Its based partially on the real-life 1940s square-off between a secret cadre of Los Angeles Police Department officers and their mobster nemeses led by the notorious Mickey Cohen. In the opening scene Cohen played with scowling Neanderthal relish by Sean Penn oversees the murder of a soon-to-be-ex-associate. Were up in the Hollywood hills just behind the sign that still reads ""Hollywoodland."" The man is pulled apart. In half. Maybe it happened in real life and maybe it didnt but launching your gangster picture on such a ridiculous note of bloody excess is certainly a risk. A misguided one. Josh Brolin better than his material narrates this highly fanciful bash which denounces its heroes methods of payback even as it celebrates the cinematic possibilities of gun-related violence. With the blessing of LAs valiant police chief (Nick Nolte) Brolins character Sgt. John OMara back from the war assembles a team to take out Cohen who has made LA his playground too long.Ryan Gosling who never really seems to be acting in any period other than 2013 plays the lady-killer copper who falls for Cohens mistress (Emma Stone). Robert Patrick and Michael Pena play a double act brought into the project; Giovanni Ribisi worms around as the electronics ace in charge of bugging Cohens digs and providing what little moral conscience ""Gangster Squad"" accommodates. Some of these characters are based on the record others are made up and most of the dialogue is made of wood befitting such rejoinders as Lets give him ""a permanent vacation in a pine box"" The template for ""Gangster Squad"" based on Paul Liebermans nonfiction account and goosed up by screenwriter Will Beall is clearly Brian De Palmas ""The Untouchables"" written by David Mamet. Good template; weak variation.The original cut of ""Gangster Squad"" featured a movie theater massacre which was taken out and rewritten and re-shot in another location. You dont really notice the lurch in continuity because although ""Gangster Squad"" boasts swell art direction (I love the nightclubs Slapsy Maxies and Club Figaro) its really just a series of gory impersonal tit-for-tat revenge killings. Only Penns line readings feel completely fresh. He may be made up to look like Big Boy Caprice in ""Dick Tracy."" He may be playing a copy of a copy of a movie stereotype. But like Brolin Penn seems to be living and breathing convincingly in another time another place. Even if that place is a movie fantasy.mjphillipstribune.comGangster Squad -- 2 starsMPAA rating R (for strong violence and language)Running time 150Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Organized Crime Gangster Squad (movie) Movies Entertainment Zombieland Sean Penn The Untouchables (movie) Michael Phillips predicts the Oscars Oscar nominations Lincoln leads Academy Award contenders with 12 10 movies to see this winter Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising71deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0108-gangster-squad-20130110,0,2803019.column",200,gangstersquad13,gangstersquad,chicagotribune

Pictures)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY review  out of fourCast Sean Penn Ryan Gosling Josh Brolin Nick Nolte Emma StoneRated R; runtime 1 hour 53 minutes; opens Friday nationwide 34 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 6 COMMENTEMAILMOREA bullet-riddled bloodbath with an all-star cast Gangster Squad is a lurid and ludicrous Mob thriller that glorifies a gangland lifestyle.In the last five minutes the film ( out of four; rated R; opens Friday nationwide) shifts gears and offers a tribute to law enforcement. But this tacked-on resolution is as sticky and fake as Sean Penns make-up job.Penn plays gangster Mickey Cohen as an over-the-top psycho lacking any of the charm that the former boxing champ purportedly used to get so many to do his bidding. Cohen was one of the most dangerous Mob bosses but as portrayed by Penn with his puttied face and snappy pronouncements he mostly comes off as laughable.STORY Delayed Gangster Squad still packs plenty of heat""Los Angeles is my destiny"" Cohen proclaims to his henchmen. And ""I am progress.""The story is set in L.A. in 1949 when Cohen brought his Brooklyn-based Mob empire to the West Coast. For a while he seemed to have most key officials in his pocket including police officers judges and politicians.Fearless in the face of Cohens trigger-happy goons war hero Sgt. John OMara (Josh Brolin) initially appears to be the only honest cop in all of the city. A distant second is Sgt. Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling) who distracts his pangs of conscience with wine women and nightclubbing.When the police chief taps OMara to form a clandestine squad to take down Cohen and dismantle his drug gambling and prostitution rings at least a half-dozen officers prove eager to play gangster. The plan is to covertly disrupt Cohens enterprises by using his own tactics so the men in blue punch pummel shoot bomb and generally behave like bad guys -- in service of a greater good.The crew he assembles is played by an impressive team of actors that also includes Anthony Mackie Robert Patrick Michael Pena and Giovanni Ribisi. Given that this was a notoriously racist LAPD though the effort to integrate the squad with a black officer (Mackie) and a Mexican-American (Pena) seems an anachronistic nod to contemporary political correctness.The story is based on true events as chronicled in Paul Liebermans eponymous book. But the screenplay written by former LAPD detective Will Beall seems to draw more on other gangster movies than insider knowledge.In one particularly unlikely scene OMara and Wooters take on a slew of Cohens heavily armed thugs in a hotel lobby. Its two against about 40. But the cops go in guns a-blazing and somehow manage to dodge all the machine gun fire and pick off most of Cohens men.In another hard-to-buy scene OMaras pregnant wife Connie (Mireille Enos) survives a machine gun attack on their house crawls across the floor and gives birth in a bathtub. The baby pops out looking ready to crawl.While there is little to recommend this movie -- and the excessive gun violence could put viewers off -- it does evoke a glamorous era with close attention paid to period costumes architecture and set design.L.A. Confidential still remains the quintessential film about the city in that era. The guys here appropriately spend a good deal of time in the less-storied environs of Burbank.If as Stephen Colbert has said ""the movies is where Americans learn their history"" Gangster Squad is just noisy disinformation.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Former co-stars Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone team up again in new film Gangster Squad which actor Josh Brolin describes as a romantic version of what happened between the LAPD and rising gangster Mickey Cohen back in the 1940s and 50s.

First Run Features By Joe Morgenstern Updated Jan. 11 2013 404 p.m. ET ""Give me the child until he is 7"" the Jesuit saying goes ""and I will give you the man."" Michael Apteds ""Up"" series says its nowhere near that simple. This unique enterprise which began as a documentary experiment almost a half century ago has grown into an inspiring testimonial to the unpredictability of the human spirit. The first installment produced by Granada TV in 1964 was called ""Seven Up"" The idea was to interview 14 English 7-year-olds representing a variety of social and economic backgrounds; later filmmakers decided to track them at seven-year intervals. The assumption was that Englands class system would prove to be the main determinant of their future. Inevitably class has played a significant role but far from the only one. In ""56 Up"" you can still see flashes of persistent personality traits as the film moves back and forth between the present and haunting black-and-white footage of the children discussing their hopes and dreams. Yet these middle-age subjects are also wondrous variations on the theme of their 7-year-old selves. Paul who was found living in a childrens home looked so pained way back then so deeply unsure of himself that it was almost painful to watch him speak and hard not to see him as a loner-to-be. Yet here we are 49 years later and hes happily married with kids who are fulfilling rich destinies of their own. Hes not yet a poster man for self-confidence but he knows it. He seems to get needed support from his wife and works with her at a retirement village where he says people ""just tend to get on with their lives no matter what."" Getting on with their lives is a pervasive theme. Tony a tough little Cockney from Londons East End wanted to be a jockey and didnt make it but he managed to pass The Knowledge the formidably difficult test for London taxi drivers then buy his own taxi and earn a good living for himself and his family. He makes fleeting allusions to his periods of wayward behavior which he regrets and his high hopes for a real-estate venture in Spain were blasted by the global recession which he had predicted with fateful accuracy. Yet his anger at what he sees as the cluelessness of the governing class hasnt dampened his zest for life or his sense of wonder at such transformations as the tatty dog track of his youth giving way to a resplendent Olympic stadium. Suzy born to privilege and clearly destined to be a highflier lost altitude by quitting her boarding school at 16 and going to Paris where she worked for a while as a secretary. But ""for a while"" is another of the films pervasive themes since many heartening changes awaited her and her fellow subjects as they grew into adults. The young woman who said she didnt like babies had three of them in a good marriage that lasted for a long while; now she seems serenely happy and surrounded by friends and family who love her. Life its been said is what happens when youre waiting for something else. Neil has spent much of his life waiting for more of the same meaning poverty alienation and homelessness. Acknowledging the influence of what he terms a nervous complaint--""I sometimes can be found behaving in an erratic fashion""--this abundantly intelligent but troubled man lives inside his head writing books that no one wants to look at let alone publish. At the same time and against the heavy odds of mental illness he lives a life of public service as a local councilman and lay minister. Since neither post pays a decent wage he is both an integral part of the community and someone who continues to live almost homeless on its margins. Neil resents the supposed celebrity that the ""Up"" series has brought him. ""Its not for this program to expose my private feelings and yet many people feel that it has."" Other subjects question whether the series has provided rounded pictures of who they are or only snippets of their lives at set intervals. Over the course of 49 years however these snippets have coalesced into an enthralling group portrait not yet complete by any means of individuals who have flourished for the most part thanks to their own resilience; who have been nourished to a remarkable degree by loving spouses and family; and whose grave disappointments in a few instances have been less attributable to the grip of class than to the vagaries of economics. Last week the journal Science published news of a fascinating psychological study involving 19000 people ages 18 to 68 in which subjects consistently underestimated the degree to which they would change in the future even though they knew how much they had changed in the past. ""56 Up"" reminds us that change is ceaseless and often dramatic bringing growth we could never have dreamed of as little kids. Watch a clip from the film ""Gangster Squad"" a chronicle of the LAPDs fight to keep East Coast Mafia types out of Los Angeles in the 1940s and 50s. Starring Sean Penn Ryan Gosling Emma Stone and Josh Brolin. (Photo/Video Warner Bros.) Gangster Squad When the classic Warner Bros. logo comes on the screen at the start of ""Gangster Squad"" its in a tint somewhere between color and black-and-white that holds out a twofold promise post-World War II Los Angeles brought back to life in the lavish style that only a Hollywood studio can provide and a movie from the studio that made many of the greatest gangster films in Hollywood history. The first part of the promise pays off. The style is sumptuous--film noir rendered in the saturated hues of ""Dick Tracy""--and the details are a historians delight Union Station the Brown Derby Slapsy Maxies Cliftons Cafeteria Zippo lighters all a-click streetcars sharing the streets with shiny Packards Cadillacs Studebakers Hudsons a fugitive Nash and a stately Chrysler Airflow. The second part pays off for a while with audaciously lurid characters and over-the-top action but theres only so much style can do to spiff up shriveled substance. The story a freewheeling fiction that Will Beall concocted from Paul Liebermans nonfiction book of the same name concerns six LAPD cops recruited to be as ruthless as their adversary the mobster Mickey Cohen whos played by Sean Penn. (Think ""The Dirty Half-Dozen"" ""Dragnet"" without scruples or ""L.A. Confidential"" dumbed down and heated up but especially ""The Untouchables"" reprocessed with supplementary gunfights that grow numbing and interminable.) ENLARGE From left Ryan Gosling (back to camera) Michael Pena Robert Patrick Josh Brolin and Anthony Mackie in Gangster Squad. Warner Bros. Pictures The squad members include Josh Brolins Sgt. John OMara an honest cop whos better at plunging in and punching out than at abstract thought; Ryan Goslings Sgt. Jerry Wooters a blithely amorous ironist and four other explosive picaresques played by Anthony Mackie Robert Patrick Giovanni Ribisi and Michael Pena. Emma Stone is Grace Cohens girlfriend and ""etiquette tutor."" Mr. Penns psychopathic monster is fun to watch when hes contemplating violence or unspeakable mutilation but not when hes committing it. And an extraordinary amount of mayhem is committed so much so that the movies original opening last fall was delayed after the movie-theater massacre in Aurora Colo.; some of the violence was dialed down (not all that much to judge from whats still on screen) and a sequence depicting gunfire in a movie theater was relocated to a soundstage Chinatown. In the standout gangster epics of Hollywoods golden era singular actors like James Cagney played unforgettable individuals--not a few of them raging psychopaths--with a fervor that still made room for moral complexity. The battling brutes of this tale arent meant to measure up to such illustrious antecedents; theyre only offered as action cartoons. But Mr. Beall a former LAPD cop has written a script so devoid of feeling that the cartoons blur into thin line drawings while whats been done with the marvelous Ms. Stone--i.e. next to nothing--is downright criminal. The director Ruben Fleischer previously worked with Ms. Stone and Jesse Eisenberg among others in ""Zombieland"" which was as light on its feet as this one is leaden. The unsung stars of ""Gangster Squad"" are the production designer Maher Ahmad the costume designer Mary Zophres and the cinematographer Dion Beebe. Theyre the elegance squad. --J.M. ENLARGE Maggie Smith stars in Quartet. Weinstein Co.. Quartet Before we get to the quartet in ""Quartet"" which is set in a comfortable English home for retired musicians let me tell you about a duet performed by a couple of aged vaudevillians with accompaniment from a geezers muted trumpet. Their song the golden oldie ""Are You Havin Any Fun?"" comes out of nowhere and provides a delightfully raffish interlude in an unexpectedly affecting comedy about people who as one phrase of the lyric understates it ""aint gonna live forever."" How much fun you have in the early stretches of the film which marks Dustin Hoffmans directorial debut may depend on your tolerance for geriatric whimsy. ( Ronald Harwood adapted his stage play to the screen.) Cissy a dotty old dame played by Pauline Collins is always amused she says when people say that old age isnt for sissies. Billy Connollys Wilf keeps making suggestive remarks to a pretty resident doctor played by Sheridan Smith. Only later do we learn that Wilfs lechery is his stroke talking; a mild frontal-lobe episode has made it difficult for him to censor himself. But the story is soon enriched by Tom Courtenays presence as Reg who has taken up residence in the home out of concern for his old friend Wilfs well-being. Then things take a turn for the dramatic with the arrival of Regs ex-wife Jean ( Maggie Smith). Shes there as a charity resident after falling on hard times but Reg still wounded by betrayal and divorce wishes she werent there at all. Cissy Wilf Reg and Jean are former opera singers with once-lustrous reputations; they constitute the movies quartet of central characters. The plot turns on the question of whether theyll be willing and able to sing the quartet from ""Rigoletto"" in a concert that may provide the retirement home with desperately needed funds. Its a pleasure to watch the working-out of the predictable conflict the prideful Jean wont take part no matter what even though we know that she will in the end. But its a privilege to watch peerless actors at the peak of their powers Ms. Smith revealing the terror beneath Jeans pride; Mr. Courtenay expressing Regs deep hurt and his need for reconciliation with exquisite delicacy. Mr. Hoffmans direction is impeccable John de Bormans camera bathes the story in warm radiance and the end credits are not to be missed since they reveal whos really who in the supporting cast. DVD Focus ENLARGE Coal Miners Daughter (1980) Coal Miners Daughter (1980) Michael Apted has called the ""Up"" series the experience he treasures most in his career but theres so much for us to treasure in his exemplary biography of the country singer Loretta Lynn. Sissy Spaceks performance in the title role won her a richly deserved Oscar and its complemented brilliantly by Tommy Lee Jones as Lorettas husband Doolittle Lynn and Levon Helm as her father Ted Webb. Tom Rickman adapted the screenplay a model of its kind from the autobiography that Lynn wrote with George Vecsey. ENLARGE The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner (1962) The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner (1962) Tom Courtenay was a skinny 25-year-old when he played the title role in Tony Richardsons contribution to the angry-young-man cycle of English films. Mr. Richardsons angry-old-man saga ""The Entertainer"" is the superior film thanks to the one-of-a-kind performance of Laurence Olivier but Mr. Courtenay is pretty remarkable as a reform-school boy who navigates the perils of his institution by running and running and then provocatively stopping. Michael Redgrave is the reformatory governor. Alan Sillitoe expanded the screenplay from his story of the same name. Walter Lassally did the excellent black-and-white cinematography; the story couldnt have worked in color. ENLARGE The Hurt Locker (2009) Summit Entertainment/Everett Collection The Hurt Locker (2009) Yes it won an Oscar and it was directed by Kathryn Bigelow from a screenplay by Mark Boal; theyre the team who did ""Zero Dark Thirty."" But Im directing you to it now because the superb Anthony Mackie whose talents are totally squandered as a knife-wielding cop in ""Gangster Squad"" plays one of the three men in the films bomb squad operating in wartime Iraq. Far from being squandered Mr. Mackie is coolly impressive and intensely effective. (The other two are played by Jeremy Renner and Brian Geraghty.) The cast also includes Guy Pearce whose role is notably foreshortened. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com Corrections amp; Amplifications The creators of the film ""Seven Up"" later decided to track its subjects every seven years. An earlier version of this column incorrectly said they made that decision at the time of the original film. Also a scene in the film ""Gangster Squad"" takes place in a soundstage Chinatown. An earlier version incorrectly said the scene showed a soundstage in Chinatown. 29 Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Floating Food Forest Arrives in New York City RNC vs. DNC Sizing Up the Conventions Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillarys One-Candidate Race Opinion A Disunited Partys Successful Convention GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% The Olympic Fantasy Confronts Reality Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

"Review Gangster Squad runs through its ammo to no avail - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowReview Gangster Squad runs through its ammo to no availGangster Squad has talented actors (Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone work well together) but cant live up to its history.January 10 2013|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Sean Penn left stars as gangster Mickey Cohen with Josh Brolin as LAPD... (Wilson Webb / Warner Bros. )The new crime thriller ""Gangster Squad"" with its swell cast led by Josh Brolin Ryan Gosling Sean Penn and Emma Stone tries to capture mob-infested Los Angeles circa 1949 when Hollywood glam ruled the Strip wiseguys took aim with tommy guns and fedoras were all the rage.Those fedoras are a tip-off of problems to come a there are simply too many of them in ""Gangster Squad.""Director Ruben Fleischer gives a lot of neon and noir-ish flash to the turf wars between East Coast and Chicago underworld figures for control of the City of Angels and their battles with the undercover cops obsessed with taking them down.FACT SHEET Sean PennScreenwriter Will Beall working with the tawdry true-life saga chronicled in former Los Angeles Times reporter Paul Liebermans book ""Gangster Squad Covert Cops the Mob and the Battle for Los Angeles"" has packed the plot with period details violence and the sort of pithy lines youd expect bruisers to be spitting out in the 1950s.But the soul of the era is missing and with it any reason to care.In Fleischers hands the high-stakes shootouts are as stylish as a GQ spread but its nearly impossible to figure out whos zoomin who. Fleischer didnt have these sorts of identity issues in the hyper-violent fun of 2009s ""Zombieland"" whose apocalyptic road trip to evade the easy-to-spot undead put the director on the map.""Gangster Squad"" has a promising start a grainy shot of a punching bag being sorely abused including one great slow-mo jab that showcases muscle a specially the beefed-up biceps of Penn as Brooklyn-born-tough-turned-Mafia-wiseguy Mickey Cohen. Its an apt image because much of the film turns on how the onetime boxer is brutally muscling his way into the top spot of the very fluid Mafia operations in L.A.But the powerful punch of that opening moment is fleeting. The movie quickly slips into something closer to a ""Law amp; Order"" procedural as the sprawling list of characters is introduced as well as the genesis for Los Angeles Police Chief William Parkers (Nick Nolte) decision to set up an off-the-books operation to wipe out mob influence in the city. With about half the force on the take and the scandal sheets breathlessly tracking every slip-up a a world so stylishly and memorably tackled by ""L.A. Confidential"" in 1997 a its no easy task.OSCARS 2013 Full coverageSgt. John OMara (Brolin) is the linchpin of the so-called gangster squad. A tough but decent cop with a headstrong wife in Connie (Mireille Enos) and a baby on the way hes no happier than the chief that someone is messing with his newly adopted hometown. Soon enough OMara has assembled his vigilante band the streetwise Officer Coleman Harris (Anthony Mackie) the ace shooter Officer Max Kennard (Robert Patrick) his sidekick Officer Navidad Ramirez (Michael PeA+-a) and the bug man Officer Conwell Keeler (Giovanni Ribisi) whose strategic wiring will give them reams of info on Mickeys plans. Ryan Goslings Sgt. Jerry Wooters initially declines but some collateral damage during a shootout in front of one of the mob bosses favorite Sunset Strip hangouts changes his mind.Meanwhile Mickey who was sent West to keep an eye on the legendary Bugsy Siegel has gangland ambitions that are Hollywood-styled complete with a Brentwood manse and a sultry redhead named Grace (Emma Stone) on his arm. His blood-drenched message to the Chicago guys to stay away a it involves cars chains coyotes and a body caught in the middle a sets the tone for the gruesome scenes the filmmakers have in store. The blood and guts get plenty of beauty shots from director of photography Dion Beebe whose refined work in ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" earned him an Oscar. (After the Aurora Colo. shootings last summer the film was delayed while a pivotal showdown originally set in a movie theater was cut and reshot in Chinatown a same violence different venue.)PHOTOS Hollywood backlot momentsAs Mickey tries to slip the ever-tightening gangster-squad noose a and as the squads questionable tactics increasingly draw fire a the movie finds some traction in a string of scenes that are elevated in the hands of these pros. Penn breathes malice into Mickeys every move making a smile out of a sneer that is particularly malevolent. Brolin is appropriately stoic; Enos who emerged as one of the sister wives to watch on ""Big Love"" and stars as exhausted gum-smacking detective Sarah Linden in AMCs recently revived ""The Killing"" steals a little of the spotlight. And once again Stone and Gosling prove that there is more than chance to their oil-and-water chemistry so captivating in ""Crazy Stupid Love.""Stones sultry voice and soft curves are a good fit for the mobsters moll in love with a cop. She and Gosling give the growing connection between Grace and the good guy a seductive power. But like too much else in the film its a scenario that is only half played out.When the gun smoke clears the body count is finished and the blood is mopped up ""Gangster Squad"" is little more than another Hollywood wannabe overshadowed by the legacy of ""L.A.

Its got overacting from Sean Penn beneath a ton of makeup as legendary Los Angeles mob boss Mickey Cohen along with underacting from Ryan Gosling as the slightly nebbishy romantic lead and down-the-middle acting from Josh Brolin as its upright cop hero. Add in the digitally re-created noir-flavored locations of postwar L.A. and the dazzling eye candy of Emma Stone in terrific period dresses and heartbreaking auburn hair and hey - by the standards of midwinter Hollywood releases not bad at all.But lets back up for a second and talk about propaganda and how it really works. Id like to declare a temporary truce around the issue of ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and its depiction of torture at least long enough for us to agree that the question of whether or not the film is propagandistic is now a matter of extensive public discourse. Nearly no one will raise such questions about ""Gangster Squad"" because it does not depict recent history and because its a conspicuously artificial Hollywood entertainment released in January. One could argue however that those things make it more effective as propaganda than an overtly disturbing film like ""Zero Dark Thirty"" could ever hope to be since the message delivery is almost invisible.What message do I discern beneath the snazzy fedoras Italianate villas and Latin-jazz supper-club numbers? Or the ultraviolent concluding shootout that rips off everything from ""The Untouchables"" to ""Bonnie and Clyde"" to ""Dirty Harry"" to various other things I didnt bother to identify? A complete whitewashing of one of the most vicious and racist paramilitary organizations in American history the Los Angeles Police Department.""Gangster Squad"" is a heavily fictionalized account of longtime LAPD chief William H. Parkers campaign to prevent Mickey Cohen and other mobsters with East Coast roots from gaining power in Los Angeles. While the movie plays fast and loose with the facts about Cohen and Parker in all kinds of ways it accurately portrays Parker (played by Nick Nolte in the film) as urging his favored cops to go beyond the law into vigilantism when they deemed it necessary. Sgt. John OMara (Brolin) Sgt. Jerry Wooters (Gosling) and the other untouchables of the ""gangster squad"" are of course presented as heroes who embark on an extralegal campaign of surveillance brutality and murder to save their city during an unprecedented emergency.That was of course precisely the rationale proposed by Dick Cheney and other leaders of the Bush administration in defending the torture seen in the opening scenes of ""Zero Dark Thirty"" -- the torture that has since been swept under the rug by the Obama administration so that we wont ask questions about its own human rights record. In both cases the motivations that lie behind the visible actions are complicated. If Bush and Cheney were trying to establish a near-absolute form of executive power which Obama has embraced and broadened William Parker was trying to preserve the predominantly white Protestant power structure of postwar L.A. against Eastern intruders with immigrant Catholic or Jewish roots. You Might Also Like ""Gangster Squad"" adds a faint patina of 21st-century political correctness to the proceedings by adding one African-American cop (Anthony Mackie) and one Latino cop (Michael Pena) to OMaras secret elite team. Not only is this wildly unlikely in the context of 1940s Los Angeles which had a near-Jim Crow level of segregation it flies in the face of Parker and the LAPDs long and poisonous relationship with the black and Latino communities. Parker is said to have originated the term ""the thin blue line"" and was among the first police chiefs to take cops off the streets of his sprawling city and transform them into a military-style rapid-response team in juiced-up patrol cars. Even an elementary grasp of L.A. history or its great tradition of crime fiction makes clear which neighborhoods the thin blue line was meant to protect and which ones - on the eastern and southern fringes of the city - it was meant to contain.Many superior films about the murkier eras of L.A.s past most prominently ""Chinatown"" and ""L.A. Confidential"" have been profoundly shaped by an awareness of the darkness beneath the California dream. On the surface ""Gangster Squad"" is simply a trivial entertainment that doesnt care (Fleischers previous films are the comedies ""Zombieland"" and ""30 Minutes or Less"") but beyond that it paints a fundamentally mendacious portrait. Will Bealls screenplay (based to a very limited extent on a book by Paul Lieberman) posits a lot of ludicrous patriotic conversation in which cops stand around at backyard barbecues exclaiming that by God they fought Hitler for American freedom and theyll be damned if they let Mickey Cohen take it away again. In order to justify the endless litany of crimes committed by police officers in this movie Penns rubber-faced Cohen is depicted as a soulless mini-Stalin who has visiting wise guys physically ripped apart by automobiles and his own underlings murdered with power drills. As J. Hoberman observes the real Cohen was nothing like that. A shrewd political calculator and sharp dresser who reportedly did not smoke or drink and held progressive racial views Cohen endured as a force in L.A. society long after his fictional demise in this movie. Whether he or William Parker was worse for Los Angeles in the long arc of history is very much up for debate; whether ""Gangster Squad"" is lazy and mendacious soft propaganda is not.

"Gangster Squad review Cartoon cops on a bloody bender | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesGangster Squad review Cartoon cops on a bloody benderGangster Squad a ""B"" crime flick populated by ""A"" actors turns out to be a paint-by-numbers police story.Sean Penn goes over the top in his portrayal of 1940s mobster Mickey Cohen in Gangster Squad.  (Warner Bros.)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Jan. 10 2013 Gangster Squad (out of 4)Starring Sean Penn Josh Brolin Ryan Gosling Emma Stone Giovanni Ribisi Michael Pena and Nick Nolte. Directed by Ruben Fleischer. 113 minutes. Opens Jan. 11 at major theatres. 14AJosh Brolin and his fellow Gangster Squad antiheroes certainly have their work cut out for them fighting Mickey Cohen the 1940s mobster psychopath Sean Penn plays with visceral glee.You cant help wonder though if Brolins Sgt. John OMara and his fellow LAPD hard nuts arent after the wrong villain. Article Continued BelowBetter they should be looking for the heinous computer boffins who turned Gangster Squad from film noir homage into a lurid cartoon something that seeks the drama of The Untouchables and L.A. Confidential but instead apes the empty theatrics of Dick Tracy. Its as if somebody took an old black-and-white Warner Bros. gangster flick colourized it all to hell and then turned the contrast dials way up on the monitor.Not that those boffins should take all the heat. Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland) directs and cinematographer Dion Beebe (Miami Vice) shoots as if theyre assembling a comic book using blood and bullets to leap the blank space between the frames. And screenwriter Will Beall a former L.A. homicide detective lards on so much sardonic period dialogue even a mere shoeshine boy sounds as if hes auditioning for a Dragnet remake.Beall isnt at all averse to the groaner. When Cohen orders one of his thugs to whack a guy telling him ""you know the drill"" the thug produces a giant electric drill. (All this scene needed was Arnold Schwarzenegger in the background shouting ""Screw youuuuu"")The actors do their best but theyre bringing their ""A"" game to a decidedly ""B"" production with Penn being the most enthusiastic of this game crew.Penn doesnt just chew scenery he devours entire gardens as Cohen a former Brooklyn boxer turned L.A. crime kingpin. Cohen may be a newcomer to the City of Angels seen in all its post-Second World War frenzy but hes got a big piece of every illegal activity going from drugs to gambling to rental dames. He has a high opinion of himself declaring himself to be God and also ""I am progress"" Hes not the least bit torn by this although the crime rival he has ripped to shreds beneath the Hollywood sign certainly is. Penn seems to have found inspiration in Al Pacinos homicidal crime boss in Dick Tracy and that includes the prosthetic face remodeling.Cohen has bought off so many cops and judges he prompts a grave and gravelly observation from one of L.A.s few remaining good guys Police Chief Parker (Nick Nolte) ""This isnt a crime wave its an enemy occupation."" Parker wants Brolins OMara a cop so square even his own wife says hes ""not much for abstract thinking"" to assemble a squad of midnight marauders to take down Cohen. These outlaw cops will work off-book and off-badge with no official sanction and no thanks whatsoever. Who could refuse an offer like this? But OMara manages to round up a redeemable cynic (Ryan Gosling) a terse sharpshooter (Robert Patrick) and his eager protege (Michael Pena) a gadget brainiac (Giovanni Ribisi) and a flash cat with a sharp knife (Anthony Mackie).What follows is an endless volley of rat-tat-tat and drip-drip-drip as the bullets fly and the blood flows to sickening excess even for a Hollywoodized gangster film where the machine gun volleys mostly just pierce cars while magically sparing the occupants.OMaras gangster squad members give as good as they get from Cohen and his goons. They work with bloody gusto but not much character nuance. Just one of them Ribisis conflicted Officer Conway Keeler bothers to stop to ask whether the line between good guy and bad guy has been erased. And then the bullets fly again.And so might the viewer express the same concern especially since Gangster Squad has been caught up in the current dragnet of public concern over gun violence. The film was supposed to come out last fall but it was pulled for emergency reshoots after a theatre bloodbath scene was too close to the real horror of last summers movie massacre in Aurora Colo.Given the amount of blood that still splashes the screen you have to wonder just how bad the excised material was.Theres not much room for women in a film like this even with Emma Stone playing femme fatale to Gosling her co-star in Crazy Stupid Love. The sizzle their pairing brought to that film is all but extinguished in the rematch.The only other woman of note in Gangster Squad is Mireille Enos an actress best know for her TV work (The Killing Big Love) who plays Brolins sassy wife and plays her well.That crack about her hubbys lack of abstract thinking? She could be talking about Gangster Squad a paint-by-numbers cartoon police story with unrealized ambitions and an unfortunate body count.Read more about Sean Penn Ryan GoslingThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

By Cary Darlingdfw.comPosted 1116pm on Thursday Jan. 10 2013 Thursday Jan. 10 2013 Friday Jan. 11 2013 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Gangster Squad may be loosely based on truth -- the takedown of notorious Los Angeles crime lord Mickey Cohen 60 years ago -- but it feels about as real as a mob-themed costume party. At least theres a certain sport in counting how many neo-noir cliches director Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland 30 Minutes or Less) can get his all-star cast to engage in over the course of nearly two hours.Sean Penn trapped underneath a layer of unconvincing makeup that makes him look more like a Batman or Dick Tracy villain is Cohen the man who ruled the L.A. underworld in the late 40s/early 50s. Hes out to set up the biggest illicit gambling operation on the West Coast and since he has eliminated all of his criminal competition and has much of the police force in his pocket whos going to tell him no?Enter the LAPDs midcentury-modern version of the Justice League a super-secret crew put together by police chief William Parker (Nick Nolte) to smash Cohens operations. Theres square-jawed war hero Sgt. John OMara (Josh Brolin) his best pal and cynical ladies man Sgt. Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling) switchblade-wielding street cop Coleman Harris (Anthony Mackie) wiretap expert Conway Keeler (Giovanni Ribisi) master marksman Max Kennard (Robert Patrick) and energetic new detective Navidad Ramirez (Michael Pena). That they happen to look stylishly natty in their fedoras and suits while drinking Nehi sodas or in the case of Wooters seducing Cohens sexy moll Grace (Emma Stone) just makes them all radiate even more of an aura of crime-fighting cool.Working from a script by Will Beall (which in turn is based on a nonfiction book Gangster Squad by Paul Lieberman) Fleischer keeps things moving briskly so viewers dont have too much time to ponder why they should be watching L.A. Confidential The Untouchables or the masterwork Chinatown again instead of this knockoff. It helps that Gangster Squad looks ravishing (thanks to cinematographer Dion Beebe director of photography on the Miami Vice movie) as Fleischer indulges every one of his Raymond Chandler fantasies.The Hollywoodland sign the Los Angeles Observatory South Centrals Central Avenue and of course Chinatown all make dutiful appearances as do lesser-known landmarks like Slapsy Maxies Hollywood nightclub and the Garden of Allah apartments where Chandler and other luminaries once lived. Theres big-band music squads of vintage cars a touch of Dragnet-style narration and when Wooters wants to know who Grace is after first spying her across a crowded room he asks a friend in typical hard-boiled fashion ""Whos the tomato?""Yet for all of that emotional resonance and any sense of real danger are about as thin as an L.A. snowfall. Despite the constant barrage of gunfire the bad guys cant hit the side of a Studebaker and theres absolutely no chemistry between Stone and Gosling (who were paired in Crazy Stupid Love to much better effect). Everyone involved including Penn seems to be playing dress-up.The only moment where you realize that this is about real people is when Chief Parkers assistant is introduced as Darryl Gates the controversial LAPD inspector and later chief who did indeed begin his career working for Parker. Anyone who lived in L.A. in the late 20th century is aware of what would become of Gates (who was ousted in the 90s in the wake of the riots that followed the Rodney King beating and subsequent trial of the cops who did it) and how the LAPDs tarnished reputation wouldnt be scrubbed clean with the downfall of Cohen.Even though the saga of L.A. corruption has been the fodder for transcendent fiction for generations theres still a great movie to be made from such colorful source material. The biggest crime in Gangster Squad is that it doesnt even come close.Cary Darling 817-390-7571Twitter carydar Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

Exhibit A Gangster Squad a mob epic that flushes a classy cast (Sean Penn Josh Brolin Ryan Gosling Emma Stone) down the sinkhole of creative bankruptcy. More News Travers Gangster Squad Owes an Apology All Stories >> Gangster Squad doesnt have an original idea in its dizzy derivative head. It looks art-deco yummy swanning around 1949 Los Angeles as mobster Mickey Cohen (Penn) the cops in his pocket gobbles up profits from gambling guns drugs and hookers. But its running on empty ripping off real-deal gangster movies - L.A. Confidential The Untouchables Bugsy and Chinatown should sue. The result is like a greatest-hits collection done by a lousy cover band. Its not a hommage to Scarface when Penn (spewing ""Say hello to my leetle friend"" glee) opens fire from behind a hotel Christmas tree sneering ""Here comes Santy Claus."" Its grand theft. Some problems cant be avoided. Time is clearly not on the side of gunplay as fun what with the recent school shootings in Newtown Connecticut and the mass killings last summer at a Colorado multiplex showing The Dark Knight Rises. A trailer for Gangster Squad featuring a gun battle in a crowded movie theater stirred so much ire that the scene was replaced in the film with a shootout in Chinatown. Too bad given the primo source material in a series of 2008 articles that Paul Lieberman wrote for The Los Angeles Times about the real history of the Gangster Squad. Brolin excels by wisely underplaying squad leader John OMara who led his rogue team on covert raids against Cohens hoods using tommy guns and enhanced interrogation techniques. Police chief William Parker (Nick Nolte) had their backs but couldnt offer official help to vigilante cops using thug methods to catch thugs. OMara recruits his dirty half dozen with help from his pregnant wife Connie (Mireille Enos of The Killing fighting a thankless role). Theres Sgt. Jerry Wooters (Gosling) the World War II vet and pussyhound who shrugs off corruption until it becomes personal. Add beat cop Coleman Harris (Anthony Mackie) to rep black L.A. cowboy Max Kennard (Robert Patrick) for oldschool kick Navidad Ramirez (Michael Pena) for Latino heat and tech nerd Conway Keeler (Giovanni Ribisi) to bug Cohen literally and figuratively. How do you botch a story like that? Start with the overcooked script by newcomer Will Beall a former homicide cop with the LAPD. Bealls fondness for detective fiction borders on parody. Director Ruben Fleischer who debuted with such promise on Zombieland inexplicably encourages the fancy-pants dialogue. Listen to Cohen on Manifest Destiny ""Thats when you take what you can when you can. Los Angeles is my destiny."" If you say so Mickey. Penn an indisputably great actor plays Cohen by channeling Robert De Niros Al Capone in The Untouchables. Hes outmatched. Gosling raises his voice an octave to play Wooters and reunites with Emma Stone his co-star in Crazy Stupid Love who looks gorgeous as Grace Faraday Cohens moll. Like Russell Crowe and Kim Basinger in L.A. Confidential these forbidden lovers want to go straight. Listen to Grace ""Youre kind. You dont talk too much. And youre a demon in the sack."" If you say so Grace. This movie made my ears hurt. Raymond Chandler Dashiell Hammett and James Ellroy could have turned this pulp into insinuating jazz. Whats here is a cartoonish bore. When the dialogue gets too much Fleischer cuts to the action which is all sound and fury signifying an overgenerous budget. This-just-in technology only emphasizes the emptiness inside. Watch five minutes of L.A. Confidential to see what might have been. Haunting resonance instead of digital flash; moral ambiguity instead of down-market escapism. But why cry over a missed opportunity? To paraphrase a wise cop in Chinatown ""Forget it Jake its January.""

Pictures/Warner Bros. Pictures (L-r) RYAN GOSLING as Sgt. Jerry Wooters MICHAEL PENAas Officer Navidad Ramirez and ROBERT PATRICK as Officer Max Kennard in Warner Bros. Pictures and Village Roadshow Pictures GANGSTER SQUAD a Warner Bros. Pictures release. By CHRIS VOGNAR cvognardallasnews.com Movie Critic Published 10 January 2013 1156 AM Updated 10 January 2013 1156 AM Gangster Squad is hardly the first movie to snap together from the scraps of other better predecessors. But theres something particularly empty about this weightless splatter of bloodshed something that makes you want to race out and rent L.A. Confidential or The Untouchables both of which could seek royalties from what turns out to be a slick composite imitation.Remember how the corrupt cops of L.A. Confidential left a trail of mayhem and sleaze as they tried to take over Mickey Cohens Los Angeles crime racket? Nothing that sinister or interesting is happening here. Its 1949 when we meet Cohen played by Sean Penn with a panting hunger for a better-written part. He has chained a Chicago mobster between two cars on a dark night. ""Let er rip"" he commands and they do.Yeah hes a bad man -- so bad that the police chief (a big grunting Nick Nolte) demands the assembly of a rogue cop unit assigned to restore law and order to the City of Angels. Josh Brolin is the square-jawed squad leader a tough war hero with an avenging- angel complex. ""I dont need a hero Sarge"" laments his wife (Mireille Enos). ""I need a husband."" Im still not sure whether Gangster Squad wants to emulate dime-novel patter or if it simply has a wooden ear for dialogue.But she has a hero by golly and soon hes off to recruit his team of Cohen crunchers. Theres the glamorous cynic (Ryan Gosling) who forgot why he became a cop (think Kevin Spacey in L.A. Confidential). Theres the tough old-timer (Robert Patrick) handy with a gun (think Sean Connery in The Untouchables).Theres Giovanni Ribisi as the brainy officer who might as well have a big X on his back. Theres Anthony Mackie and Michael Pena providing a nod to diversity in a movie too timid to address the racism of the time and place. All acquit themselves well despite having almost nothing of interest to say. Youll find a more ripping yarn in L.A. Noire the popular video game thats based in a similar milieu complete with Cohen.Perhaps realizing he has no substance to work with director Ruben Fleischer slathers the style on thick. A Zippo lighter gives off a mini cascade of fireworks. Shootouts are riddled with gratuitous slow-motion shots and freeze-frames. The camera cranes down for lush exteriors of famed Los Angeles landmarks (Union Station and the Park Plaza Hotel are among the movies most welcome stars as is cinematographer Dion Beebe).Whats missing from Gangster Squad is a core a point of view something to patch together the cheese and carnage. A story for instance (those always come in handy). Thats a shame because the time and place are so ripe for mischief and wrongdoing.James Ellroy used Cohen to great effect in his paranoid crazy-quilt LA novels including L.A. Confidential and White Jazz. They werent for all tastes but they had a world view (dark and nasty) and a feel for the periods grimy soul. What were left with in Gangster Squad are pretty boys (and one girl Emma Stone) playing cops and mobsters operating outside the law but ultimately squarer than a cardboard box.Follow Chris Vognar on Twitter at chrisvognar.GANGSTER SQUAD(C-) Directed by Ruben Fleisher.

(Wilson Webb ) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Thursday January 10 2013 238 PM Title Gangster Squad Film Info With Josh Brolin Ryan Gosling Emma Stone. Crime drama about the team that took on gangster Mickey Cohen. Director Ruben Fleischer (153). R Strong violence language. Area theaters. A lot changed in popular culture last year especially at the movies. Popcorn entertainment finally grew up (see ""The Avengers"" ""Argo"" ""Skyfall""). Women stepped out of supporting roles and fought battles of their own. And cinematic gunplay was given deeper resonance by offscreen tragedies. ""Gangster Squad"" was directly impacted by the latter. Originally scheduled to open last September the film was recut to delete a movie theater massacre after the real-life multiplex murders in Aurora Colo. But does such a change honestly matter if equal carnage takes its place? Thats a question for another day though certainly one worth asking ourselves and our filmmakers. Today we note merely that this movie is at its worst when it relies lazily on an abundance of bloodshed. And its at its best when everyone puts their weapons down and takes the time to tell this story In 1949 Los Angeles reigning gangster Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) considers himself king. Hes paid off the police kept the Mafia at bay and put every possible judge in his pocket. But there are a few honest men left including Sgt. John OMara (Josh Brolin). With the quiet approval of Police Chief Parker (Nick Nolte) OMara assembles a team designed to eliminate Cohen and his vicious hold on the city. Jamie Trueblood Ryan Gosling as Sgt. Jerry Wooters and Josh Brolin as Sgt. John OMara in Gangster Squad. OMaras soldiers in this small army include his cynical best friend Sgt. Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling) along with a wiretap expert (Giovanni Ribisi) a wry detective (Anthony Mackie) an old-timer (Robert Patrick) and a newcomer (Michael Pena). Also ready to help are OMaras practical wife (Mireille Enos) and Jerrys girl (Emma Stone) -- who also happens to be Cohens mistress. When Fleischer and screenwriter Will Beall (adapting from a book by Paul Lieberman) rely on their outstanding cast ""Gangster Squad"" feels like solid if not exactly spectacular entertainment. A scenery-chewing Penn indulges himself but its fun to watch these guys play-act in a highly-stylized recreation of classic movie themes. (A less generous film fan may simply see a ripoff of better efforts at homage like ""The Untouchables"" or ""L.A. Confidential."") While Enos makes a strong impact in her minor role Stone should be automatically rejecting these paper-thin girlfriend parts. And shes not the only one underused. Patrick knows how to grab a spotlight but Mackie Pena and Ribisi are like Stone wasted in superficial supporting work. Even Gosling seems to be cruising on charisma while waiting out more interesting offers. Fleischers noir-influenced focus on OMara and Cohen offers hints of interesting commentary about Hollywoods historical visions of good and evil. But its a strong starting point that fizzles by the finale. Instead of expanding their sights Fleischer and Beall narrow them into a repetitive and increasingly exhausting series of shootouts. By the end those guns might as well be held by extras rather than some of the most talented actors of our time. Magic Moment The squad has just minutes to break out of prison.

"Gangster Squad | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; gangster-squad ) Gangster Squad (United States 2013) January 10 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli There seems to be little doubt that Ruben Fleischer the director behind the well-received Zombieland and the less well-received 30 Minutes or Less is a Brian De Palma fan. How else to explain the kinship that exists between Fleischers latest Gangster Squad and De Palmas classic The Untouchables (with a little Scarface thrown in for good measure)? The similarities go beyond the requisite plot points that exist in all gangland stories; Gangster Squad unspools almost like a remake of The Untouchables albeit with a souped-up ending and a relocation from Prohibition Era Chicago to post-WWII Los Angeles. Theres no Battleship Potemkin homage but there is a nod to Sunset Blvd. Gangster Squad is an unashamedly pulpy thriller that borders at times on an exploitation flick but its determination to follow The Untouchables template (without the benefit of a David Mamet script) makes it a little too predictable to be memorable. Steeped in blood gore and violence Gangster Squad delivers what fans of the gangster genre expect from a movie of this sort. Its chock-full of ""guilty pleasure"" moments. Sean Penn playing real-life mobster Mickey Cohen hams it up expertly channeling Al Pacinos Tony Montana without the accent. The good guys are stolid sturdy men - paragons of virtue up against a feral villain who is so vile that even the notorious Chicago mob cant stand against him. Despite the talent of the cast Gangster Squad isnt a ""prestige"" motion picture and its release date shift from September 7 to January 11 didnt damage its nonexistent Oscar chances. Its an inferior Untouchables knock-off and proud of it. The year is 1949. Mickey Cohen is building his underworld empire in the alleys and bordellos of post-war L.A. Half the police force is in his pocket. He owns the dope and sex trades and has a plan that will give him control over all the illicit money funneling into the West. Mickey doesnt think small and he calls himself Progress. Standing in his way is the ""Gangster Squad"" - a group of six dedicated lawmen who work under the radar to bring down Cohens empire by any and all means possible. Sgt. John OMara (Josh Brolin) gets the commission from Chief Parker (Nick Nolte) after he proves himself to be incorruptible. He hand-picks his cohorts fellow war veteran Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling); a cop with a dim view of authority Coleman Harris (Anthony Mackie); a sharpshooter Max Kennard (Robert Patrick) and his sidekick Navidad Ramirez (Michael Pena); and a wiretapper Conway Keeler (Giovanni Ribisi). The Gangster Squad gets off to a rough start with two of its members stuck behind bars (leading to a cartoonish jailbreak). But once they plant a bug in Mickeys demesne things take a turn for the better. Their many successes are conveyed via a montage replete with newspaper headlines. Eventually Mickey decides he can no longer afford to absorb the losses he is taking and decides to take the fight to his enemies. The results are predictably bloody although no one brings a knife to a gunfight. Like The Untouchables Gangster Squad plays fast and loose with history. The real Mickey Cohen like Al Capone ended up running afoul of the tax code. Thats wasnt dramatic enough for Fleischer who invents a more cinematically appealing climax that includes the staple of testosterone-drenched movies the fist fight. Theres also a car chase but perhaps because it features 40s vehicles it feels more energetic than the generic version of this sort of thing. The cast is upscale with a two-time Oscar winner (Penn) and three Oscar nominees (Nolte Gosling Brolin) leading a group that includes one of the hottest young actresses currently working in Holywood (Emma Stone). This isnt really an actors movie however so it gives the performers an opportunity to have some fun. Penn and Nolte get to do a little scenery chewing and Brolin flexes some muscle. Its not a great part for Emma Stone who looks terrific in the period costumes but as the woman caught between Cohen and Wooters her thinly drawn character often looks like a deer caught in headlights. Gangster Squad will remind everyone of The Untouchables but suffers greatly by the comparison. Thats a little unfortunate because taken on its own terms it offers its share of lowbrow entertainment. Like any genre film all Gangster Squad has to do is generate a little box office noise to fulfill expectations. Entering multiplexes in the icy wasteland that is early January Gangster Squad provides a welcome burst of heat and color even if those qualities are more illusory than real and subject to a fast fade.

Photo Credit Warner Bros. Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT In 1949 a group of off-the-books cops battles Los Angeles crime lord Mickey Cohen. BOTTOM LINE A good-looking cast and strong action sequences are just enough to forgive the cornball script. As for Penns overacting thats another matter. CAST Josh Brolin Emma Stone Ryan Gosling Sean Penn LENGTH 153 A throwback in nearly every sense ""Gangster Squad"" takes place in the glamorous Los Angeles of 1949 a time of Tommy guns Zippo lighters and felt fedoras. Its script too feels old enough to have been typed on an Underwood but thats all right. A gorgeous cast and some hard-hitting action make this period flick a mostly enjoyable trip to Hollywoodland. Written with square-jawed earnestness by former LAPD detective Will Beall from Paul Liebermans nonfiction book ""Gangster Squad"" stars Josh Brolin as John OMara an incorruptible police sergeant (and intrusive narrator) vainly fighting crime in a town ruled by ruthless kingpin Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn more mumbly than menacing). Hard-charging Chief Parker (Nick Nolte) finally orders OMara to assemble a secret black-ops-style team to bring Cohen down. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Who was the Sons of Anarchy Homeless Woman? OMaras dirty half-dozen come from diverse ethnic and filmic lineages. Michael Pena and Anthony Mackie are the minorities; Robert Patrick as Max ""Hopalong"" Kennard moseys in with a drooping mustache and six-shooter; Giovanni Ribisi plays the wiretapping techie; Ryan Gosling is the insouciant Jerry Wooters who happens to be fooling around with Cohens moll Grace (Emma Stone appealing though still looking young for the role). The squadmates blow things up commit arson and shoot people in the face but viewers who were discomfited by the morally murky torture scenes in ""Zero Dark Thirty"" will find everything spelled out clearly here. The characters wonder aloud whether the means justify the ends. The answer Yep sure do But the movie is mostly fun and you might even forgive the self-serious moments (""My badge is the city of Los Angeles"" says our hero). Ruben Fleischer (""Zombieland"") directs with panache cinematographer Dion Beebe (""Chicago"") makes everything look swell and its all just enough for ""Gangster Squad"" to get by. PLOT In 1949 a group of off-the-books cops battles Los Angeles crime lord Mickey Cohen. RATING R (strong violence language smoking) advertisement | advertise on newsday CAST Josh Brolin Emma Stone Ryan Gosling Sean Penn LENGTH 153 BOTTOM LINE A good-looking cast and strong action sequences are just enough to forgive the cornball script. As for Penns overacting thats another matter. Brolin plays a modern gangster Josh Brolin says he didnt watch old gangster movies as part of the research for ""Gangster Squad"" in which he plays squad leader Sgt. John OMara. In those films everyone talks with a crisp -- almost stilted -- cadence and ""Gangster Squad"" is more contemporary. Also those movies are very dark the opposite of the look of Brolins new movie. ""I think the film has a very colorful palette. I think it looks very rich. Usually when you have films like that like L.A. Confidential they usually are desaturated. Theres a milkiness they put into it to make it look more authentic and I dont think that was attempted on this movie and Im glad it wasnt attempted. Its like a new era of gangster movies"" Brolin said. His pre-filming work schedule included getting together with castmates including Ryan Gosling and Giovanni Ribisi. This gave them a chance to get comfortable together and to go over the dialogue. There was a lot of ad-libbing in the movie but in Brolins case his dialogue was cut down to give his character a more quiet power. ""You dont want to mess with this guy but you want him on your side. Hes willing to think outside the box. Hes unwilling to be bought. Theres something dangerous about him and hes willing to do whatever he has to."" -- Fresno Bee Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The stylishly empty period crime drama Gangster Squad from Zombieland director Ruben Fleischer is ostensibly based on a true story but it steals liberally from James Ellroy Dick Tracy and The Untouchables and it seems hell-bent on topping its transparent inspirations in at least one crucial respect the volume intensity and ubiquity of its wall-to-wall violence. The film serves as yet another dispiriting reminder that while the MPAA can be squeamish and hypocritical about depictions of sexuality filmmakers can nevertheless flood the screen with enough carnage for a world war or two yet walk away with an R rating. Gangster Squad isnt an exploration or condemnation of violence so much a mindless celebration of bloodshed in pursuit of justice. Theres a distinct irony in the films heroes (Josh Brolin and Ryan Gosling) defeating fascism abroad in World War II only to bring order to post-war Los Angeles through massive illicitly sanctioned displays of uber-violence sabotage and destruction. But the film is too dim-witted and enamored of coolly stylized mayhem to acknowledge the contradiction let alone critique it. Lantern-jawed Brolin stars as a heroic detective in post-war Los Angeles assigned by his superior (Nick Nolte) to assemble a group of incorruptible badasses to wage war against the crime empire of Mickey Cohen played by Sean Penn as a sneering heavy with the coiled body language of the boxer he once was and a heart of pure evil. Brolins team of Untouchables includes charming ladies man Gosling (who has finally reached the level of glib self-parody) weasel-faced electronics whiz Giovanni Ribisi hot-headed Anthony Mackie and sharpshooter Robert Patrick whose performance as an anachronistic cowboy feels like a feature-length homage to Sam Elliott. Nolte tells Brolin and his men to venture far outside the law and destroy Cohens outfit though Brolins gang of hoodlums for truth justice and the American way dont need much encouragement in that department. Late in the film Ribisi asks Brolin whether maybe theres something a little troubling or even hypocritical about their gangster-smashing squad trying to destroy Cohens empire using tactics even the vicious Cohen might find excessively destructive but the film is so unrelentingly positive and unambiguous in its depiction of righteous violence that this stab at moral ambiguity feels arbitrary and halfhearted. Gangster Squad aims for the pop-operatic intensity of The Untouchables but ends up feeling like a savage simple-minded comic strip. Thanks to Dion Beebes gorgeous cinematography an exquisitely costumed cast that includes Emma Stone (in the painfully underwritten role of a moll sleeping with both Penn and Gosling) and overall high production values Gangster Squad looks fantastic but it doesnt have an original thought inside its pretty little head. It isnt a rousing exploration of the secret history of Los Angeles so much as an unusually violent fashion show.

Confidential."" But youll be forgiven for thinking that youre watching ""The Untouchables II."" Like David Mamet and Brian De Palmas reboot of the classic crimebuster TV show this new movie offers a stalwart cop with a devoted red-headed wife putting together a crew of renegade cops (including an old-timer and a bespectacled nerd) to take down a powerful and sadistic mobster played by a Method-fueled scenery chewer. Back then it was Kevin Costner Patricia Clarkson Sean Connery Charles Martin Smith and Robert DeNiro; this time around we get Josh Brolin Mireille Enos Robert Patrick Giovanni Ribisi and Sean Penn. The players are different but the games the same. Penn plays ruthless ex-boxer Mickey Cohen whos already running the drug and prostitution rackets of late-40s L.A.; armed with his own policemen and judges hes about to take over all west-coast bookmaking operations which would make him completely invulnerable. Before that can happen LAPD chief William Parker (Nick Nolte) decides to assemble a squadron of clean cops who will declare war on Cohens empire. Chosen to head up the group is John OMara (Brolin) who opens the movie by rescuing a young innocent from one of Cohens pimps and liberating a building full of women who were being doped up on their way to work in the kingpins brothels. With the help of his smart and devoted wife Connie (Enos) -- and kudos to Will Bealls script based on the book by Paul Lieberman for not making this character the usual guilt-inducing albatross -- OMara picks his team. Joining OMara on his quest are grizzled sharp-shooter Max (Patrick) downtown flatfoot Coleman (Anthony Mackie whose character we first see throwing a knife into the hand of a drug dealer mid-transaction) tag-along Navidad (Michael Pena) tactician and surveillance expert Conway (Ribisi) and cynical ladies man Jerry (Ryan Gosling) whose current lady Grace (Emma Stone) also happens to be Cohens girlfriend. Director Ruben Fleischer (whose previous features include the inventive ""Zombieland"" and the dreadful ""30 Minutes or Less"") loves his period detail but hes not afraid to spill gore on the shiny shoes. Round after round of ammo gets fired (the heroes have a much better hit rate than the villains of course) unfortunate underlings get burned alive or drilled in the face or torn apart by the eras huge cars and theres even one montage where the squads spree of violence against Cohens goons and his dens of vice is practically staged like a musical number. If all of ""Gangster Squad"" delivered on that level it would be easy to forgive the derivativeness that hounds it throughout but there are other problems. Theres a very specific rhythm to the 1940s movie-patter that the filmmakers have chosen to make the default speaking pattern of everyone in the film and some nail it better than others. Brolin Penn and Enos would have been right at home exchanging barbs with the leads in ""Double Indemnity"" but Gosling and Stone (whose scenes together were the highlights of ""Crazy Stupid Love"") dont quite speak-a the jive. Theyre exceedingly talented film actors but theyre the only ones here who feel like time travelers from the 21st century. Still if you dont mind a little blood spattering your glossy post-war reveries ""Gangster Squad"" never lets up on its momentum often injecting surprising humor or character moments into an otherwise by-the-numbers story. And if nothing else its way better than youd expect any movie released by a major studio in January would ever be. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

"Gangster Squad 2.5 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article Gangster Squad 2.5 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED INFO Gangster Squad Bad to fair 2.5 stars. Director Ruben Fleischer. Cast Sean Penn Ryan Gosling Emma Stone. Rating R for strong violence and language. RELATED NEWS Interview Emma Stone Hotlist Emma Stones best movies Gangster Squad to debut after reality intervened Hotlist Ryan Gosling By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Jan 10 2013 1217 PM Looking at the credits for ""Gangster Squad"" it was surprising to find that it wasnt based on a comic book. It would have been fitting because Ruben Fleischers film about the consolidation of power by the gangster Mickey Cohen in LA in the late 1940s and 1950s plays like a live-action cartoon. But no there it is just a regular script by Will Beall based on Paul Liebermans non-fiction book. The characters are cliches particularly Cohen himself played in absurdly broad fashion by Sean Penn. Sean Penn The guy is a great actor. Here he seems to be doing a parody of a noir gangster ready to mow down all youse guys if you cross him. Its head-scratching stuff really. Cohen has bought off a sizable chunk of the city and police force allowing him to expand his criminal empire. Hes got his sights set on controlling all the wire bookmaking in the western U.S. and with his clout and crooked influence it seems as if there is nothing stopping him. Cue the dramatic music. Here comes the gangster squad. It doesnt happen that way but it wouldnt have been any worse if it had. What actually happens is a new police chief William Parker (Nick Nolte) has had enough. He enlists Sgt. John OMara (Josh Brolin) a hero in World War II and a straight-arrow cop to stem the tide of Cohens influence. This is one of those off-the-books assignments. Report to no one. Just get the job done. OMara with the help of his wife (Mireille Enos) recruits a group of like-minded cops Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling) a playboy type; Coleman Harris (Anthony Mackie) a Black officer with contacts in the African-American community; Max Kennard (Robert Patrick) a shoot-em-up cowboy type who seems to have wandered in from an episode of ""Bonanza""; Kennards sidekick Navidad Ramirez (Michael Pena); and technology nerd Conwell Keeler (Giovanni Ribisi). The film is somewhat similar in structure and temperament to ""The Untouchables"" Brian De Palmas far superior 1987 film about Eliot Ness going after Al Capone. The head-on approach can only work for so long so other methods must be found. As with De Palmas film despite being the good guys OMara and his men must resort to unsavory extra-legal means to level the playing field. There is a really good story in here somewhere. Cohen is a fascinating figure operating in an interesting time. Here hes a cardboard cutout prone to hilarious bouts of rage (and bouts period; he was a boxer). Think of any gangster cliche youve seen or heard and Penn delivers. He is nothing if not thorough. Usually thats a good thing. Here not so much. Brolin plays things a lot straighter. He and Gosling are actually pretty good and Emma Stone manages to escape the most-obvious gun-moll cliches as the object of Cohens affections and later those of Wooters. That triangle should pose more of an element of danger than it does. But like the rest of the story its simply not thought-out enough to really register. ""Gangster Squad"" looks right. The cast seems ideal. Bits and pieces here and there entertain. But it never really comes together in a satisfying way and given the talent involved that adds up to a big disappointment.

Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn made up like a Dick Tracy villain) runs the town ruthlessly; just ask the guy he orders to be literally torn in half in the first ridiculously gory scene. A pugilist turned malicious mobster Cohen has almost every cop and judge in his pocket and only no-nonsense flatfoot John OMara (Josh Brolin) dares tread where his bought-off cowardly colleagues wont. It isnt long before our square-jawed hero is recruited to clandestinely clean up the town with the aid of a multiculti crew of pistol-packers played by Ryan Gosling Anthony Mackie Robert Patrick Michael Pena and Giovanni Ribisi. Call them...the Goon Force Uh make that...the Hoodlum Battalion No wait I know how about...the Gangster Squad Though based partly on actual events Ruben Fleischers ludicrous shoot-em-up plays fast and loose with the facts and plenty else besides. Theres a parodic touch or two evident in the early scenes--Penn doing a Bela Lugosi impersonation during a gruesome interrogation; Gosling hepcatting his every move as the squads designated lady-killer--that jibes with Fleischers own comedies-of-extremity Zombieland and 30 Minutes or Less. But it soon becomes clear were not meant to laugh at these determinedly covert operatives so much as stand in awe of their way-of-the-gun stoicism. The overripe machismo and capital-A Acting quickly become tiresome especially whenever Penn chews the scenery or Gosling does his patented narcissistic-rake act to charm the vulnerable moll (Emma Stone) he falls in crazy stupid love with. But at least lots of pretty period-perfect re-creations of postwar L.A.--kudos production designer Maher Ahmad--get blown up and bullet-riddled real good.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr GANGSTER SQUAD Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling star in this L.A.-based criminal drama (Wilson Webb) C Gangster Squad Genre Drama; Starring Josh Brolin Ryan Gosling Nick Nolte Sean Penn; Director Ruben Fleischer; Release Date Wide 01/11/2013; Runtime (in minutes) 105; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted January 18 2013 -- 1200 AM EST Set in Los Angeles in 1949 Gangster Squad is all about how John OMara (Josh Brolin) a police sergeant with the fine bones of a hero and the saturnine squint of a man who has seen the dark side launches an offensive against Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) a ragingly ambitious psycho hoodlum who wants to make L.A. his empire. OMara knows that with a monster like Cohen traditional law enforcement methods wont cut it. Hes going to have to get dirty. So he puts together a squad of officers -- Ryan Gosling as the cute smooth charming one Giovanni Ribisi as the early version of a tech nerd and so on -- who will travel around the city without badges disrupting Cohens rackets by using his violent tactics against him. This is one of those period underworld pictures that revel almost fetishistically in the details of the era the long coats and fedoras and tommy guns the iconic shots of old L.A. architecture the ruby red lipsticks and body-hugging 40s gowns worn by Cohens moll (Emma Stone a little too nice for the part) the nightclub where a Carmen Miranda-like figure swivels her hips as she sings ""Chica boom Chica boom"" Yet beneath the luster of its costumes and set design Gangster Squad is all guns-blazing recklessness and tinny-bloody set pieces. Its like L.A. Confidential remade as a mediocre Jason Statham film. It keeps going chica bang bang. As Cohen the infamous boxing champ-turned-Mob kingpin Sean Penn does all he can to give one of those knowingly over-the-top performances -- think Pacino in Scarface or De Niro in The Untouchables -- that turn sociopathic rage into grand opera. The waxy makeup hes wearing makes him look a bit too much like a villain out of Dick Tracy but Penn narrowing his eyes to slits and crumpling his kisser into a puckered obscenity machine plays Cohen as a boneheaded but ruthlessly articulate power addict. Hes a schnook from the streets whose insane ambition -- to own everything including the police force -- is his way of making himself ""respectable."" When Penn is on screen Gangster Squad is far from great but it does crackle with a certain gutter fascination. The trouble is that the director Ruben Fleischer (the music-video veteran who made Zombieland) lures us into wanting to see a thriller that runs on intrigue but OMara and his team of cops never come up with a devious or even very coherent plan. They beat the hell out of folks bomb storefronts and race through the boulevards in their cool 40s cars. And the movie as criminal drama goes nowhere. Brolin and Gosling are both supposed to be playing World War II veterans who bring their knowledge of battle into the tough turf of the streets but thats just a concept that the sketchy half-baked script tosses out there. Ditto for the secret and supposedly dangerous love affair between Goslings Sgt. Jerry Wooters and Stones Grace. Youd think that there would be a scene in which Mickey discovers whats going on and fills the screen with his venomous threat. But no. In Gangster Squad even the ultimate underworld betrayal is just another part of the scenery.

Sadly it wasnt worth the wait. Its failings arent due to the top-notch cast which includes Ryan Gosling Josh Brolin and Emma Stone. Those three are mostly OK even if some of their roles are underdeveloped. Its the screenplay that brings down this action flick. This film image released by Warner Bros. Pictures shows Ryan Gosling as Sgt. Jerry Wooters in Gangster Squad."" (AP Photo/Warner Bros. Pictures Wilson Webb) ( Wilson Webb ) And what a shame that is. Director Ruben Fleischer (""Zombieland"") has vividly brought to life the late 1940s-50s Los Angeles. He production designer Maher Ahmad and costume designer Mary Zophres welcome us into a richly detailed era that tailor-fits this crime story about a clandestine group of lawmen trying to take down crime boss Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn). Fleischer stages and paces action set pieces like a champion from a climactic shootout at a hotel Christmas display (love those exploding bulbs) to a suspense-filled Chinatown encounter. But at times he goes overboard on the violence making it glaringly gratuitous. Really do we need to see a guy get ripped apart by two cars?Advertisement ""Squads"" screenplay by Will Beall alternates between violent and silly until it goes so over-the-top we stop caring. Beall whos a novelist and former homicide detective based his crime avenger story on journalist Paul Liebermans nonfiction book. One of his biggest problems is Grace (Emma Stone) a love interest that Beall created for the Gosling and Penn characters who is not given much to do. The romance between Gosling and Stone is so boring and phony it makes you almost forget how well the two played off each other in ""Crazy Stupid Love."" Here they have no chemistry whatsoever and the screenplay does nothing to help them turn up the heat. On his own Gosling has some fine moments as his character leaps into mob-fighting action.Bealls two main characters -- the single-minded Sgt. John OMara (Brolin) and the narcissistic Sgt. Jerry Wooters (Gosling) -- have a lot of potential but most of it goes untapped.Brolin is a commanding on-screen presence as a World War II veteran waging his own war but hes not given much to play with especially when it comes to the dialogue which is limp. Neither was anyone else for that matter. The films best moments -- written well by Beall -- dont involve the needlessly graphic violence. Rather they come in the exchanges between OMara and his smart pregnant wife Connie (Mireille Enos) who helps select the squad in question. Connie is the most intriguing character in the whole lot. You just wish her character had more screen time than the boys.Other members of this squad have their modest moments with Robert Patrick and Anthony Mackie standing out. But its Penn as Cohen their nemesis who surrenders to too many histrionics and comes off as far more comical than the scary presence hes supposed to be. Penn doesnt modulate his Cohen and while hes obviously having fun here I wish we could say the same.""Gangster Squad"" needed to rein it in in so many ways. As theyd say back in the day Sweetheart give me rewrite.GanGSTER SQuad  Rating R (for strong violence and language)Cast Josh Brolin Ryan Gosling Emma Stone Sean Penn Anthony Mackie Nick NolteDirector Ruben FleischerRunning time 1 hour 53 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top Redwood City One dead in Highway 101 crashRedwood City San Jose man sentenced to 30 days in jail for leading police on chaseNHRA Top Fuel driver Steve Torrence sets a national mark  Article commenting rules of the road Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

The new movie season begins with a bang. Gangster Squad is a period piece set in 1949 about Jewish Brooklyn-born thug Mickey Cohen who moved to the West Coast to rule the underworld in Los Angeles and the clandestine six-man squad of cops assigned to bring him down. It comes equipped with the disclaimer ""Inspired by a true story"" which means it is about as embellished by false claims as Zero Dark Thirty. But with its exotic Hollywood locations gorgeous tailored camera-ready clothes fit for a fashion layout sleek cars jazz music and glamorous cinematography by Dion Beebe (the Oscar winner who shot Memoirs of a Geisha) its a cross between L.A. Confidential and The Untouchables--a case of style over substance but enough of both to sustain interest. Sometimes the two-fisted assault-weapon adventures of the gangster squad seem more like the daredevil exploits of Superman but you wont yawn. Who knows if the violence and torture administered to everyone who crossed the path of the criminal elements in postwar L.A. was a gruesome as it is depicted here or if there ever was a gangster squad but we do know the basics are rooted in fact. Mickey Cohen (coldly menacingly played by Sean Penn with enough sangfroid to freeze the blood in your veins) was a ruthless powerful madman with everyone from the LAPD to City Hall on his payroll making it easy for him to control--and profit from--every racket from narcotics and prostitution to guns and illegal gambling. This movie is not only about one of the mafias most notorious scumbags but also about two honest cops (Josh Brolin and Ryan Gosling) decorated with World War II combat medals and recruited by the L.A. police chief (Nick Nolte) to fight corruption smash organized crime clean up the LAPD and restore pride and respectability to the City of Angels. Directed by Ruben Fleischer whose career has been largely devoted to trash like Zombieland this movie does not come with impressive credentials or high expectations but it grows on you as it goes along. The script by Will Beall a former homicide detective rings with tension and authenticity. The acting is uniformly first-rate especially by Mr. Broslin and Mr. Gosling as the two war heroes drafted to start another kind of war. Unfortunately the characters of their fearless hand-picked comrades-in-arms (Anthony Mackie Giovanni Ribisi Michael Pena and Robert Patrick) are less convincingly examined and they come off as paper dolls in blue. The films least convincing sidebar is a sexual affair between Mr. Gosling and Mickey Cohens redheaded mistress a high-class slut named Claire (Emma Stone) that is not only daring and foolish but downright suicidal. This attempt to wedge some sexy allure into the quiet moments between shootouts fails because the two actors have no chemistry even in the nude. The best thing about Gangster Squad is how they got the 1940s accoutrements right. The coupes and sedans at a time when cars had as much personality and flash as the people who drove them instead of looking exactly alike are thrilling to watch. The Hollywood stucco the band singers in the neon-lit clubs and mafioso bars who all sound like June Christy--its as good as it gets in the movies. The violence perpetrated by Cohen is also entertaining in a grim sort of way--locking up innocent girls fresh off the train and keeping them hopped up on Mexican dope burning his own goons alive in closed elevator shafts. Cohen organizes a dragnet to wipe out the gangster squad and you remain glued to the screen to see which cast members are still alive in time for the lavish finale. No spoiler alert here but Im telling you that when the squad arrives to serve a warrant for Cohens arrest and faces an army of gangsters who have taken over an entire Los Angeles hotel decorated for Christmas its a denouement worthy of grand opera guaranteed to take your breath away. Gangster Squad is uneven. Sean Penn with his flattened nose and his face lined with scars of rage is sometimes so harrowing you wouldnt want to meet him in broad daylight. Other times falling back on Cohens early days as a prizefighter he shadow boxes with his fists while barking orders like a one-man skit on Saturday Night Live. And some of the choices that only an unskilled director would have made--a drill drives through a victims skull and when the blood splatters against the glass the scene cuts to a raw hamburger patty hitting the fire of a backyard barbecue grill--just make you wince. You dont know whether to laugh or scream. Despite the flaws and the occasional corn this is still one of the most exhilarating and entertaining action films in recent memory. Whatever else you may think youll go away from Gangster Squad knowing youve been to the movies. rreedobserver.com GANGSTER SQUAD Running Time 113 minutes Written by Will Beall and Paul Lieberman (book) Directed by Ruben Fleischer Starring Sean Penn Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone Comment Filed under gangster squad movie Rex Reed Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture The Man Who Made Blue Oyster Cult RIP Producer Sandy Pearlman Culture Breaking Miamis Wynwood Arts District Is a Hotbed for Zika Politics Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://observer.com/2013/01/in-gangster-squad-stylish-sets-captivating-cinematography-and-top-notch-billing-overcome-callow-direction/,200,gangstersquad36,gangstersquad,com/2013/01/in-gangster-squad-stylish-sets-captivating-cinematography-and-top-notch-billing-overcome-callow-direction/

Four months later a turn in the films plot that relies on gunning down an adolescent risks recalling Newtown but the proximity of horrible headlines scarcely matters--released on any day of any calendar year Gangster Squad would be a crime against cinematic sensibility. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - As Gangster Squad opens boss Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) well on his way to establishing an empire of vice is the snake in the West Coast Eden of prosperous Los Angeles circa 1949. Setting the scene in voiceover is Los Angeles Police Department sergeant John OMara (Josh Brolin) an ex-commando-turned-supercop introduced in merciless but futile action against Cohens agents--OMaras efforts are stymied by crook-coddling legal malarkey like arrest warrants. Naturally then hes eager to ditch the badge and step outside the law when Chief Parker (Nick Nolte) offers him the chance to put together an unofficial unit to bust up Cohens rackets.The team includes Robert Patrick as a six-shooter-packing Old West holdover and Anthony Mackie and Michael Pena as tokenized black and Hispanic ambassadors. The only one given a story line to himself is Ryan Goslings Sergeant Jerry Wooters who has been keeping his sense of duty catatonic with drink and women--his shiftless character is established in watching him work the floor at nightclub Slapsy Maxies in one of the tracking shots that are director Ruben Fleischers equivalent of a childs ""Look at me"" headstands.Film Details Gangster Squad RatingR GenreDrama Running Time113 More Info Trailer Wooters takes up with Cohens arm candy whos granted no additional depth by Emma Stone; this gives Gosling occasion to ply his shy-heartthrob trade the swollen-cheeked sheepish little boy champing to show off his cantaloupe biceps. It would be the films silliest performance were it not for Penn donning a pound of putty to play Cohen. The makeup departments approximation of an ex-boxers smushed mug makes him something like a Dick Tracy villain and Penns hammy Cohen quotes Bela Lugosis Dracula when he first appears preparing to draw and halve a rival behind the Hollywood sign.Shot by Dion Beebe and digitally touched up with the lurid palette of a pulp cover Gangster Squad on occasion suggests the better movie it might have been. This is especially true when it toys with the hyper-reality of showbiz law enforcement in which cops pose as cowboys and thugs make believe theyre Famous Monsters of Filmland. It also gives lip service to more rote themes ""Can you remind me of the difference between us and them?"" the vigilante squads techie played by Giovanni Ribisi pauses to ask Brolin whos later called to muse that given his strong-arm tactics he ""might as well be Mickey Cohen."" This is meant to pass for moral-gray-area thematic complexity though in practice it only helps Gangster Squad be simultaneously tawdry and blandly apologetic about it.All of the usual cop-opera conceits--""duty"" ""badge of honor"" ""fraternity""--will be trotted out but its only the pummeling violence that stirs Fleischers interest. With little pause Gangster Squad caroms from crime to retaliation from tommy gun assassination to heroin-shipment rundown from a power drill through the head to a pistol whipping each fresh bloodletting hyped by Steve Jablonskys score or peppy period tunes counterpoised for ironic effect. In reducing the great themes of the Warner Bros. crime-film legacy to so many bases to be rounded Gangster Squad desecrates the symbols of the movies it alleges to homage in the process making a once-great language banal.Other words long ago stripped by the movies of whatever meaning they had--""Inspired by a True Story""--open Gangster Squad. Los Angeles Times writer Paul Liebermans book of the same name which recounts the extralegal historical exploits of actual sergeants OMara and Wooters beside a breezy history of L.A. law and order is the basis for Will Bealls screenplay. Contributing a few savory bits of hard-boiled gristle (""This cop came outta nowhere like an early frost"") Beall also brings with him the irresistible backstory of having been a former homicide detective in the LAPD and the attendant claim to insider realism.Its obvious however that Beall is mostly drawing on his experience with other movies particularly the previous generation of revisionist period crime dramas films like Brian De Palmas 1987 The Untouchables which Gangster Squads plot hews close to and Curtis Hansons 1997 L.A. Confidential. Unlike Hansons film which had a shoe-leather realism Gangster Squad looks as if all its details--each shiny Packard and bottle of Orange Nehi--have been scrupulously ""placed"" still warm from the art department while panoramic shots recall the virtual environments of Rockstar Games L.A. Noire.Noltes Chief Parker insists theres a ""war for the soul"" of this Los Angeles but its just a neon haze of pixels--while the lazy trashy Gangster Squad is damning physical evidence that the war for the soul of Hollywood is in a bad way.

The cops play things as dirty as the crooks in ""Gangster Squad"" an impressively pulpy underworld-plunger that embellishes on a 1949 showdown between a dedicated team of LAPD officers and Mob-connected Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) for control of the city. Set squarely in classic-noir territory the bombastic crimer applies a pre-Production Code amorality to this world of vice though its gleeful depiction of violence backfired once already forcing the removal of a scene featuring Tommy guns blazing in a crowded movie theater due to the shootings in Aurora Colo. A six-month delay should heal all wounds for this Warners release. Recent headlines land farther from home for this solid retro-toned ensembler from director Ruben Fleischer (""Zombieland"") which admittedly seems a little too keen to put its 21st-century stylistic stamp on the ruthlessness of the era. Opening with a scene in which Cohen chains a rival between two cars as a message to his Chicago bosses this macho genre homage plays closer to ""The Untouchables"" than to ""L.A. Confidential"" as a self-aware gloss on old gangster pics. Loosely derived from true events as chronicled in Paul Liebermans book Will Bealls screenplay concerns the moment when shortly after Bugsy Siegel left for Vegas Cohen made his play for Los Angeles. An ex-boxer whose belt-winning brutality forms the backstory of Penns portrayal Cohen evidently had most of the citys peace officers in his pocket which posed a challenge for police chief William Parker (Nick Nolte sounding gruff as ever). The way Parker sees it the only way to keep L.A. from going the way of Gotham Chi-Town and Sin City is to wage guerilla war on Cohens operations. His ideal general is a WWII vet named John OMara (Josh Brolin) a gung-ho sergeant so intent on playing the hero he singlehandedly brings down one of Cohens prostitution rings in the first reel. With Parkers blessing OMara assembles the pics eponymous team of enforcers whose job it is to upset Cohens gambling sex and drug rings around town -- an assignment complicated by the fact that dirty cops are often participating in these activities and are all too eager to defend their patron. Its here that a fascinating true-crime foundation gives way to fantasy; there are moments in ""Gangster Squad"" where Fleischer is so far out on a limb it makes ""Dick Tracy"" look like a documentary. But its all in the spirit of classic B-movie fun and however over-the-top the action gets (a shootout in the lobby of the Park Plaza Hotel is a veritable orgy of bullet casings blazing muzzles and flying shrapnel) every creative decision seems to be in service of telling the most entertaining possible story backed by first-rate wardrobe and art contributions and underscored by Steve Jablonskys might-makes-right music. Besides you cant beat this cast. In the good guys corner theres Ryan Gosling Anthony Mackie Giovanni Ribisi Robert Patrick and Michael Pena (a refreshingly mixed-race bunch despite the period). Opposite theres Penns larger-than-life performance as Cohen a feat of unbridled entitlement. He fumes and storms like some kind of Cro-Magnon monster who just stumbled from the cave to claim what is rightfully his feral intensity amplified to a pitch not to be dwarfed by Al Pacinos Tony Montana Robert De Niros Al Capone or Harvey Keitels own spin on Cohen in ""Bugsy."" Smart guys dont cross Mickey Cohen unless theyve got some sort of death wish which is why the squads mission feels more suicidal than anything they faced on the front lines. To raise the stakes Beall gives OMara a pregnant wife (Mireille Enos) and concocts a patently crazy scenario in which pretty-boy cop Jerry Wooters (Gosling all attitude and eyelashes) seduces Cohens No. 1 moll (Emma Stone). Stone looks right for the period her voice as smoky as the art-deco dives she inhabits though her mannerisms clearly belong to this century. That goes for nearly the entire ensemble which is fine given Fleischers tendency to toy with slow-motion eye-catching closeups (as when a 40-foot thumb flicks a cigarette lighter) or impossible CG-enhanced shots as in a mostly digital car chase. With his lantern jaw and tough Glenn Ford-like attitude only Brolin looks as though hes been on hard-boil since the era in question (though one supposes the underused Nolte has been salt-curing since his ""Mulholland Falls"" days as well). It took Brolin nearly 45 years to grow into the family chin and now it looks square enough to break not only Cohens knuckles but his entire foothold in Los Angeles. Despite its striking use of authentic L.A. locations from Union Station to the Hollywoodland sign (the year of its abbreviation) this highly stylized retelling plays as artificially as a stagebound musical owing in part to ""Chicago"" d.p. Dion Beebes deeply shadowed nearly all-nocturnal lensing. Although it glories in its violent elements the movie seems pitched at a teenage sensibility that makes such savagery incongruous. Teens are just the sort who might appreciate cutting from brains splattered on frosted glass to a raw hamburger patty thrown on the grill but theres really no need for such flourishes. Only once does anyone question the squads methods That would be Ribisis officer in a reflective scene that may have been added during reshoots -- and hes right to ask.

Daily Edition Login to download Gangster Squad Film Review 800 PM PST 1/6/2013 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS A fine cast in a cartoonish version of L.A. crime lore. TWITTER L.A. mobsters and cops clash in Ruben Fleischers violent melodrama starring Josh Brolin Ryan Gosling Sean Penn and Emma Stone. Gangster Squad is a sensationalistic fantasy about how a clandestine unit of LAPD fuzz supposedly brought Mickey Cohen Californias baddest gangster to his knees in the late 40s. Made up of synthetics rather than whole cloth this lurid concoction superficially gets by thanks to a strong cast and jazzy period detail but its cartoonish contrivances fail to convince and lack any of the depth feeling or atmosphere of genre stand-bearers like L.A. Confidential. Warner Bros. should be able to shake down reasonable short-term business with this year-opening roll of the dice. PHOTOS Todd McCarthys 10 Best Movies of 2012 This often violent melodrama was meant to debut last year but was pulled for reshoots after the Aurora Colo. theater shooting tragedy; one scene previewed in the trailer featured gunmen firing at the audience from behind the screen of Graumans Chinese Theatre. Even so the film still features plenty of extra-imaginative barbarity beginning in the opening scene with Cohen splitting a poor sap in two by attaching him to cars pulling in opposite directions up near the Hollywoodland sign (the last four letters were removed in 1949 the year this story is set). Former L.A. homicide detective Will Bealls adaptation of veteran Los Angeles Times writer Paul Liebermans 2012 nonfiction book has more to do with movie lore than with what really happened pitting a Magnificent Seven-type group of do-gooders against mobsters trying to take over the town after World War II. More than anything the film is marred by a connect-the-dots approach to storytelling that shoves the action from incident to incident with no thought to dramatic layering character complexity political nuance or twists that might buffet the drama into unexpected realms for a time. Everything is wham right on the nose (or in the gut) with nary a grace note or beguiling detail to distract or seduce. PHOTOS Marketing Violence Hollywoods Posters For Early 2013 Movies But there is incident and plenty of it all portrayed in a brutal modern fashion rather than in a style one would ever associate with the noirish films of the era itself or with the more recent tangy nostalgic evocations of it. Constrained from going after Cohen (Sean Penn) and his goons due to a widely corrupt police force new LAPD chief William Parker (Nick Nolte) recruits a special squad that will operate on the QT to stop Cohen from taking over the city completely. Unfortunately all the characters are hardly more dimensional than caricatures identifiable by one main trait and barely individualized beyond that. Heading up the team is straight-arrow Sgt. John OMara (Josh Brolin) a war hero ready to fight the bad guys on the homefront after whipping the enemy overseas. Signing up in due course are Sgt. Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling) whose womanizing skills come in handy to lure Cohens current flame Grace Faraday (Emma Stone) into their game; Central Avenue black beat cop Coleman Harris (Anthony Mackie); old cowboy sharpshooter Max Kennard (Robert Patrick); eavesdropping technology expert Conwell Keeler (Giovanni Ribisi); and rookie Latino tag-along Navidad Ramirez (Michael Pena). These are good actors but aside from Brolin and Gosling theyre barely given any special moments of their own to make their marks here. While theyre getting organized Cohen a scrappy former boxer from the East who already runs drug prostitution and extortion rackets is ready to make his big move to control all the wire bookmaking west of Chicago. Half the town seems to be on his payroll and when anyone takes even one step out of line or fails him Cohen goes berserk and has someone put a power drill through his head. VIDEO New Gangster Squad Trailer More Gosling More Guns One of the films biggest miscalculations is to have made Cohen an undiluted psychotic with no compensating charm or charisma. Most accounts of the real guy refer to how entertaining he was how he catered to celebrities journalists and politicians and was courted by them in return. Reportedly he mostly kept his dark side hidden whereas Penn looking not unlike Dorian Grays portrait plays him exclusively as a raving homicidal maniac who might even have given the Nazi hierarchy pause. OMaras crew begins with somewhat ill-planned lightning assaults on Cohen knowing it will come down to a race between their success in shutting him down and the gangsters discovery of whos on his tail. On a moment-to-moment basis some of this stuff is OK; Gosling and Stone work very well together and the her characters precarious slither from Cohens clutches to Jerrys embrace generates modest tension while Mireille Enos brings great warmth and a surprising amount of honest emotion to the potentially hackneyed part of OHaras worried pregnant wife. PHOTOS 11 Biggest Book-to-Big Screen Adaptations of the Last 25 Years Ultimately Gangster Squad is all about instant gratification almost as much for the characters as for the viewer. The film pays corny lip service to the idea that by using thuggish extra-legal tactics the off-the-grid cops are lowering themselves to the same level as the gangsters theyre pursuing. No lines of dialogue here ring less true than these as everything else bout the film so fully endorses their Wild West methods. On a production level considerable effort has been expended to reproduce Hollywood Boulevard and other city environs the way they supposedly looked in the transitional days and nights of the late 1940s; theres plenty of local color to feast upon but a mood never sinks in too preoccupied are the filmmakers with hurrying along to the next showdown.
