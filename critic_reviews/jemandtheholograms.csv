Taking the basic structure and post-punk iconography of the 80s cartoon series about a globetrotting girl-band the film proceeds to discard anything that might be genuinely interesting or inspirational about the concept replacing it with pap pop bland girl-power and contradictory messages about making it on your own. Teenage songwriter Jerrica Benton (Aubrey Peeples) leads the kind of deprived childhood thats only found in Hollywood movies - living in a huge house in California with her aunt (Molly Ringwald) and three sisters all of whom seem to be able to afford recording gear fashion and superfast laptops. When Jerrica becomes an overnight YouTube sensation under the name Jem stardom comes calling in the form of Juliette Lewiss brittle label boss. But Jem soon realises that life in the LA fast lane isnt as glamorous as it looks on TV. Theres fleeting pleasure to be had in seeing a film solely made to appeal to young women - the one notable male character he spends a lot of his time fawning over the heroine. But its all so horribly cynical with every line every twist and every note of music painstakingly focus-grouped to extract maximum cash value from the audience. At least theres satisfaction in knowing that this tactic failed miserably the film was a disastrous flop in the US. Hey maybe audiences can think for themselves after all.

Entertainment ""Jem And The Holograms"" Has The Worst Ideas About Authenticity In reinventing the 80s cartoon for the viral age the movie presents some fucked-up ideas about what it means to be a genuine artist. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Hayley Kiyoko Aubrey Peeples and Stefanie Scott in Jem and the Holograms. Universal Pictures ID 7180125 Theres a part in Chuck Klostermans recent GQ profile of Taylor Swift in which he mentions to the singer/songwriter/massive star that a mutual acquaintance had referred to her as ""calculating"" and you can pretty much feel her flinch right there on the page. Its a term she hates -- and who wouldnt? -- because it implies theres cold-blooded curation to her sometimes very public friendships romantic relationships and interactions with fans. Swifts brand after all is one of abiding earnestness and accessibility which means her songs are assumed to be confessional and are inevitably and lengthily analyzed for how they correlate to past lovers friends or frenemies.But calculation in a broader sense is also a quality we pretend isnt suited to artists especially female artists who are often expected to be impulsive and uncontrived and more concerned with the heart than the mind. Which is bullshit -- as Swift points out she probably wouldnt have achieved the same dominance as a singer and songwriter if she were just ""shooting from the hip."" ""In that sense I do think about things before they happen"" she said. ""You can be accidentally successful for three or four years. Accidents happen. But careers take hard work.""The main character in Jem and the Holograms Jerrica Benton aka Jem becomes a star by way of one of those accidents. Shes a normal 18-year-old suburban girl (played by Nashvilles Aubrey Peeples) who rockets to an improbable sort of internet stardom after a video of one of her songs becomes a viral hit. But shes also of course a reimagining of a character from the 80s cartoon as is her sister Kimber (Stefanie Scott) and her foster sisters Shana (Aurora Perrineau) and Aja (Hayley Kiyoko) who eventually also make up her band. View this image > Peeples and Juliette Lewis in Jem and the Holograms. Universal Pictures ID 7180140 Jem and the Holograms -- which was directed Jon M. Chu (of Step Up 3D and G.I. Joe Retaliation) and written by his Legion of Extraordinary Dancers collaborator Ryan Landels -- is a very loose low-budget live-action take on the Hasbro show and toy line one that tries to transform the story from one about a character with a secret rock star identity to one about a character worried her online persona doesnt reflect her true self. And this is a goddamn ingenious idea that someones better-lit more rehearsed Instagram-filtered internet self is the contemporary Jem to their IRL Jerrica. But the movie itself turns into this flaming garbage pile that shows exactly how confused everyone is about what constitutes authenticity these days.Because as is often the case Taylor Swift is right. Jem and the Holograms is a movie about a pop star for whom nothing is planned and who rises to a ridiculous level of celebrity in what is apparently the space of a month. Its all about setting up a false division between what is genuine and pure and what is calculated and therefore phony. It does a runaround on the idea of musical stardom involving work or desire carefully relieves its main character of ever having to make a choice that could be interpreted as something so sullying as ambitious.The video that makes Jerrica or rather Jem a viral star gets uploaded by Kimber without her knowledge. Jerrica only accepts the L.A. gigs Starlight Records owner Erica Raymond (Juliette Lewis hammy enough for a croque monsieur) offers -- and that form as much of a throughline as the movie can manage -- because Jerricas Aunt Bailey (Molly Ringwald) needs the money to keep her house. Jerrica as far as we can see had no actual desire for a professional music career until it was bestowed upon her by the internet and that is meant to mark her as a sincere talent. View this image > Peeples in Jem and the Holograms. Justina Mintz / Universal Pictures ID 7180154 For a movie about someone learning to come out of their shell Jem and the Holograms is utterly confounding about what it even means to be authentic. Here are some of the things to which it gives a thumbs-downGetting professionally styled Because when their makeovers happen the girls personal fashion choices get insulted and its strongly suggested they reimagine themselves -- but when they break free in the end they choose to wear what are essentially the same looks.Pop music Pops hollowness is affirmed by both a rant from love interest Rio (Ryan Guzman) about ""pop tarts who cant sing"" and by Jerricas joking insistence on being given the label of ""rock star"" even though the groups songs are undeniably catchy simulacra of recent pop radio hits.Artificially enhanced performances During a gig at a legendary venue the power goes out and Jerrica and co. demonstrate their musical cred by continuing on acoustically -- except that they also managed to rehearse to perfection a song theyve seemingly never performed together before in the space of a day.Aliases Jerricas choice to perform in a wig and glittery makeup as Jem apparently makes her easily replaceable in the eyes of Starlight Records though why no one would be able to tell the difference is never clear especially when she got famous off the strength of an original unadorned song.Theres also the strangeness of Jerricas battles to bring her sisters along as her band while Erica tries to manipulate her into a solo contract. Like many of the movies plot developments these maneuvers make no sense (toward the end characters attempt an elaborate break-in involving a building that they should be able to walk into without any problem and lets not even get started on the robot). But then neither does Jerricas insistence that her siblings are part of her act when she wrote and performed the song that went viral by herself.Its as if theres something unseemly about her really claiming the spotlight despite having earned it the other characters scolding her for her selfishness in not trying harder to haul them along for the ride. Not every would-be star needs swagger but its disheartening to watch a supposedly uplifting storyline that reinforces such negative messaging about owning your work having aspirations training and pursuing goals. Jem and the Holograms bombards its heroine with messages about believing in herself not being afraid and letting her specialness shine at which point the opportunities will just come to her. Aurora Perrineau Scott Kiyoko and Peeples in Jem and the Holograms. Justina Mintz / Universal Pictures Perrineau Kiyoko Peeples and Stefanie Scott in Jem and the Holograms. Justina Mintz / Universal Pictures ID 7180209 Jem and the Holograms may not be realistic in its depiction of viral stardom but it does get something right in this new era of online celebrity which is that it insists its heroine find more of a reward in how inspiring she is to her fans than in financial compensation. Its fitting because the film was initially framed by its producers as a collaborative effort involving fans of the original Jem who were encouraged to submit ""audition"" videos as well as ones in which they talk about what they loved about the cartoon.Their testimonials about what the character meant to them were then cut into the completed film to represent an outpouring of internet love for this new Jem whose three released songs have apparently saved lives and taught people to be themselves over the course of her month of fame. The existing fan love was callously crowdsourced and leveraged into a product thats now being resold to those same people. Now whos being calculating?

Chu looks back on Step Up 2 Justin Bieber and more Jem and the Holograms exclusive Kesha to appear as The Misfits leader Pizazz Jem and the Holograms update was made with new generation in mind Jem is contagious Truly truly truly outrageous But who exactly has she been dragged into 2015 for? Thats a question director John M. Chu (his resume includes two Step Up films) doesnt really answer in his updated already much-maligned take on the cult 80s cartoon. In this version Jerrica (Aubrey Peeples probably best known for her arc on Nashville) is a modern-day girl living with three sisters (two of them adopted) and her aunt (an underused Molly Ringwald) in a comfortable but run-down house in the Valley. Jerricas got a special gift you see but shes shy about using it Even though she loves to sing the songs shes written late at night in her room she wont even think about putting them online. So her wily baby sister does it for her under the Jem pseudonym shes created--and faster than you can say Snapchat or Boomerang or whatever the kids are into these days her strummy little homemade ballad has made her a bona fide mystery-shrouded sensation. Thats when Starlight Enterprises CEO Erica Raymond (Juliette Lewis) comes calling sweeping all four girls away to her L.A. lair to mold them into superstars.  We know shes nefarious from the start--but shes also against all biological probability the mother of Jems requisite romantic interest (28-year-old Ryan Guzman a.k.a. the guy who loved J.Los cookies in The Boy Next Door). Further plot complications come from Synergy a cute little robot who whirs like a highly evolved Roomba and leads the girls on an elaborate scavenger-hunt-style chase designed by Jems father for unknown reasons before he died.  And all of this is interspersed with musical performances--the later songs are actually much better than the one that supposedly made Jem internet-famous--earnest lessons on honesty and friendship and sometimes-jarring clips of real kids displaying their talents on YouTube. In that respect Chu is certainly on the bleeding edge of contemporary filmmaking; by embracing an uber-democratic Gen-Z-eye view of cinema one where everyones a star he may literally be showing us the future. (Or maybe hes just bolstering his movies microbudget with a lot of low-res video. Its hard to tell.) Regardless there probably isnt a lot here for the greying Gen Xers who grew up with the cartoon Jem in their living rooms unless they have tween daughters they really want to share this experience with. Theyre safe to leave the kids on their own though if they want to save two hours and 12 As silly and sometimes nonsensical as it is the movie is surprisingly sweet and well-intentioned. The underlying message of sisterhood and self-empowerment is strong and the films heart really is made of gold or at least discount sparkles. Separated from its source material--and the unfair expectations of original Holograms loyalists (nostalgia its a hell of a drug) --Jem is probably much better for not being outrageous. Theres enough of that on Boomerang already.

"Corporate Synergy The Focus-Grouped Mundane Sci-Fi Mess of Jem and the Holograms << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Corporate Synergy The Focus-Grouped Mundane Sci-Fi Mess of Jem and the Holograms Universal Movies October 23 2015 by Molly Lambert Facebook Twitter Print I love B movies. I generally love them more than A movies. B movies are unpretentious theyre low-budget they arent angling for awards or prestige. Theyre just trying to entertain people and make some money and I respect that. B movies dont have to be good and they can even be bad. All they have to do is keep my interest. While watching Jem and the Holograms I kept thinking of other B movies in a similar vein the Britney Spears vehicle Crossroads the criminally underrated Josie and the Pussycats and the effervescently sardonic Spice World. Jem lacks one crucial thing that these other movies have jokes intentional or accidental. But what it lacks in humor it makes up for in sheer weirdness -- its a master class in How Did This Get Made? It feels focus-grouped to within an inch of its life but its so strange that its impossible to imagine what process led us here. Its coproduced by Justin Bieber Svengali Scooter Braun and you can feel what the makers are going for -- Pitch Perfect with a rock band -- and laugh when it turns into accidental outsider cinema by virtue of its inane plotting and bizarre choices. But I was never bored and thats what counts -- theres so much strangeness to process in Jem. I laughed out loud a few times the hardest when Jem visits her childhood home in Los Angeles and its the same Angeleno Heights Victorian gingerbread house that played the whorehouse where Dick Whitman/Don Draper grew up. I also laughed when two separate characters in different scenes wore Velvet Underground shirts. Director Jon M. Chu1 responsible for several of the sequels in the immensely entertaining Step Up series and director of the two fascinatingly evangelical Bieber documentaries has been tasked with making a musical for social-media-savvy millennials. This is telegraphed through some experimental choices location-establishing shots are shown on Google Earth and fake YouTube videos are woven throughout the film. Some of it works. Chus choice to cross-cut scenes of conflict with purposely low-quality (i.e. ""Internetty"") video clips of drum battles actually feels fresh. And if the movies musical sequences were just better staged and conceptualized Jem might have made more sense. My friend laughed as Jem strode out on stage for the climax -- impossibly acoustically finger-picking a Flying V guitar. The intra-band friendships are barely established before being pushed aside for all the other exposition. Jem refuses to sell out her friends but the movie refuses to give her band any distinguishing traits besides hair colors. As it is its a dance movie without any dancing Ladies and Gentlemen the Fabulous Stains without anything resembling true empowerment. The performance sequences are jarring mostly because making Jems music sound like Mumfordcore stadium folk-rock with Imagine Dragons live drumming contradicts the bands stylization as 80s rock stars. In todays terms that means they look to us like a 2000s electroclash band -- with her pink triangular face paint and hair Jem resembles a desexualized Peaches. That 2000s/80s feeling persists but visual signifiers bear no relation to actual content in Jem. You can sense the hand of crowdsourced studio opinions -- Jem is neither a rock star nor a pop star and her music seems distinctly current in that it feels like the filmmakers boiled down a bunch of songwriters and styles into a ""whats not to like?"" folktronic stew. The movies ""hit"" song ""Youngblood"" combines shout-along folk rock with party pop but avoids veering into actual instrumentation or specificity. This lack of personality runs counter to the theme of self-actualization that the filmmakers cold-cock the audience with at every turn. Jem is ostensibly about authenticity and remaining true to yourself but the heavy hand of corporate influence and groupthink is never far away. Its based on a dormant Hasbro property that was created to sell dolls which became hugely popular for a moment in the mid-80s. The Jem cartoon was created by Christy Marx who wrote for G.I. Joe (another Hasbro property) before creating Jem and the Holograms. It put an American twist on some anime tropes -- a magical girl squad each of whose members are associated with a color (as in Sailor Moon) secret pop-idol identities much like those of superheroes and of course a semi-sentient computer built by Jems dead father. The Jem cartoon was animated by Japanese studio Toei Animation which did anime classics like Cutie Honey Galaxy Express 999 Dragon Ball and Sailor Moon. Toei also did Hasbros Transformers G.I. Joe and My Little Pony. The show and product line were so popular that Mattel made Barbie a rock star with a backing band called the Rockers and created an accompanying cartoon just to compete with Jem. The 80s were strange in every possible way and one of them was the innovation of reverse-engineering TV shows around which to build merchandising. Unlike Josie and the Pussycats or Spice World Jem isnt a savvy or cynical commentary on merchandizing. But what would one expect from a movie licensed to cash in on nostalgia for a cartoon invented to sell dolls? The films argument about authenticity barely makes sense in a modern context. Is selling out even a thing in an era when everyone has a ""personal brand"" online that they vigorously market nonstop? The idea of Jem has potential -- bifurcating human identity into Internet/stage persona and real person is a rich vein mined by Hannah Montana and Perfect Blue alike. But this isnt a movie for grown-ups its for kids. And so no real darkness is allowed to enter the narrative. Everything in Jem is so clean it squeaks except for Juliette Lewis as the villain Erica Raymond. Lewis sweeps in and spins golden line readings. Shes fabulously high-camp as an evil record executive in the grand tradition of Parker Posey in Josie and Gina Gershon in Showgirls -- she knows what movie shes in. As my friend and I walked out of the theater a fellow audience member turned to me and said ""What would Siskel and Ebert think?"" It was as though this person had overheard my thoughts because I said ""Well Ebert might have liked it because he wrote Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"" a Russ Meyer movie about a girl band whose members come to Los Angeles to make it big and end up having their souls destroyed by a Machiavellian music business mogul which is pretty similar to the plot of Jem. Except the band in BTVOTD christened the Carrie Nations takes acid and gets naked and generally behaves in a way you might call rock n roll including playing rock songs. Jem and the Holograms are so hopelessly wholesome that the movie cant even bother to give Jem a downward spiral where shes seduced or at least tempted by the perils of fame let alone sex and drugs. Among the movies many odd choices is the one to depict the truly outrageous story in a semi-naturalistic fashion rather than going cartoony or exaggerated. It starts out as a story about a rock band made up of sisters -- a sort of ""Haim and the Holograms"" -- and then clumsily morphs into mundane science fiction somewhere about halfway through. Its strange to have to ask a movie to lean more into its weirdness when the main plotline involves the protagonist discovering a magical robot. Jem nee Jerrica finally discovers how to click her magic purple earrings a transformation sequence that also clicked some weird nostalgic ASMR part of my brain that doesnt remember much about Jem but instinctively remembers that much. But she doesnt even transform into Jem through this maneuver -- it just triggers a hologram of her dead father to appear and explain his dreams for her. This was the point at which I found myself hoping Jerricas deceased father the robot scientist would reveal to his daughter that she too was a replicant that her empathy and humanity were just programs her mainframe had been built to run. In that story like in the real world Jem was created expressly to be a product -- selling out is what she was meant for all along. This is Chus second go-round with a kitschy 1980s toy brand.

Chus big-screen reinvention of the popular 1980s Hasbro animated show Jem and the Holograms was first unveiled deeply upset fans of the original took to the Internet. Among those voicing their displeasure at the obvious liberties taken with the property was no less an authority than William Shatner who tweeted ""I watched the Jem trailer. No star earrings? Where are the Misfits????"" Shatner and the shows devoted fans would be well advised to steer clear of the final product. Not being part of the generation that watched the show I cant vouch for its merits. But its safe to say that it must be miles ahead of this wan bloated screen version which forgoes the originals sci-fi and thriller aspects. Reduced to a teen girl empowerment vehicle that trots out every show business cliche about sacrificing your values for stardom the film is a non-starter that is unlikely to attract the intended target audience. Read More Spectre Film Review Aubrey Peeples (ABCs Nashville) plays the lead role of Jerrica a sensitive teen who lives with her widowed mother (Molly Ringwald) younger sister Kimber (Stefanie Scott) and foster sisters Aja (Hayley Kyoko) and Shana (Aurora Perrineau) in a nondescript California town. When Jerrica sings a soulful self-penned ballad in front of her cell phone camera -- she claims to hate being filmed but rarely misses the opportunity -- Kimber surreptitiously uploads the performance to YouTube. Naturally it barely takes a day for the video to go viral attracting the attention of Erica Raymond (Juliette Lewis enjoyably chewing the scenery) the rapacious CEO of Starlight Music whose skintight spandex pants and haughty manner immediately establishes her as no good. Showing up at Jerricas home with underling in tow Erica tells her and her sisters to ""forget all that dismal mediocrity you grew up in."" She transports them to Los Angeles puts them up in the companys lavish mansion and assigns their care to her hunky son Rio (Ryan Guzman The Boy Next Door) who assigns them a curfew that they immediately break. Jerrica now known by her stage name Jem has brought with her a small mechanical device created by her beloved dead father. Through plot machinations too tiresome to relate it becomes an adorable robot named ""Synergy"" whose role in the story is mainly to make childlike noises. Read More The Witch Star Signs With CAA To prevent her family from being dispossessed from their home Jerrica reluctantly signs Ericas proffered solo artist contract which just as well could have been delivered by the devil and drops her sisters from the band. But in just an instant -- well it seems like eons -- she sees the light and with the help of Rio manages to right her wrongs and yes become a big music star without having to compromise. Geared to todays youth who dont believe they exist unless they express their most banal feelings in front of a camera the film features endless snippets of tweens and teens tearfully testifying about how much Jem and the Holograms mean to them. The several concert sequences are equally histrionic although the generic pop music performed all too realistically reflects the manufactured quality of much of whats on the charts these days. Director Chu clearly knows something about this having directed a couple of the Step Up films and not one but two Justin Bieber documentary features. The film features cameo appearances by Dwayne Johnson Chris Pratt and Jimmy Fallon all professing to adore Jem. (Note to Fallon Johnny Carson was cool because he didnt gush about everything and he didnt take easy money to appear in bad movies.) In one scene Jerrica -- or Jem whatever -- and her sisters spontaneously break into song in the middle of the night underneath the Santa Monica Pier (dont ask). ""Shut up you stupid kids Im trying to sleep"" shouts an angry homeless woman. Its a sentiment that will undoubtedly be shared by any adults forced to chaperone their kids to this desperately cynical exercise.

This Jerrica though is an insecure millennial who achieves sudden fame when her sister Kimber (Stefanie Scott) secretly uploads a video of her singing to YouTube. Jerrica must contend with the pressures of celebrity and music-biz greed even as she follows a series of clues her deceased father left behind so she could complete the robot he was building for her.Wait what? A robot? The diminutive droid named S1N3RGY is perhaps the most awkward remnant of the films source material. In the original TV series the more conventionally-spelled Synergy was a computer that could project holograms to turn Jerrica into Jem. Here S1N3RGY feels like a wildly incongruous afterthought in a movie that mostly dumps the TV shows singular sci-fi-tinged flamboyance to create a cloying contemporary teen flick about finding companionship through music and social media.Hasbros two biggest successes the ""Transformers"" and ""G.I. Joe"" franchises capitalized on decades-old products that had nonetheless maintained longevity through revivals on TV and toy store shelves. But ""Jem"" attempts to update a property thats been defunct and essentially forgotten since the late 80s. Hardcore fans wont find much of the Jem they loved under the movies achingly hip millennial trappings while young newcomers will be left wondering what a robot has to do with a rock band.Patrick Dunn is an Ann Arbor-based freelance writerJem and the HologramsGRADE D+Rated PG for thematic material including reckless behavior brief suggestive content and some languageRunning time 118 minutes 70 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1LRBVUP MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/10/23/movie-review-jem-holograms/74451926/,200,jemandtheholograms5,jemandtheholograms,detroitnews

Julia Cooper Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 23 2015 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Oct. 23 2015 1200AM EDT Comments AA Directed by Jon M. Chu Written by Ryan Landels Starring Aubrey Peeples Molly Ringwald Juliette Lewis Country USA Language English We are in the opening moments of director Jon M. Chus peppy revamp of the campy eighties cartoon Jem and the Holograms. Here sitting cross-legged and staring into her webcam we find Jerrica Benton (Aubrey Peeples) confessing that she is the mysterious pink-haired rock star Jem to her best friend - the Internet. Her sister Kimber (Stefanie Scott) leaked a video of Jerrica strumming on her guitar in wigged disguise as Jem to YouTube and its 2015 so overnight the number of views climbed the tweets amassed and that video went viral. An Internet star was born. Even though Jem and the Holograms bills itself as an origin story - how did Jerrica become the badass CEO of Starlight Music and the truly outrageous rock star Jem? - it is a movie almost aggressively of the moment with little patience for its source material. Chu has turned the intuitive computer Synergy into a cute robot pet and Jem into Justin Bieber. He has his female lead mimic Biebers real-life viral rise to fame in a movie that is clearly for millennials not for the cult fans of the original series.Like the Internet news cycle it recreates the new Jem shows no signs of nostalgia coasting instead on an extended present driven forward by inspirational moments and montages. By repeatedly cross-cutting to YouTube footage of wannabe stars the film punctures the fantasy world it attempts to project and gratingly insists on its authenticity. Whereas Hasbros cartoon Jem and the Holograms was spunky brash and over the top this live-action version of Jem and her sisters dispenses with the camp and goes straight for corny. Theres hardly tension barely any drama and the sugar high you might expect from an eighties redux is replaced by a dull aspartame buzz.Jem and the Holograms is from the makers of Pitch Perfect and in that spirit it is fun to see an all-female cast rocking out on screen. But this story of female empowerment and friendship was produced entirely by men two male producers a male director and a male writer. Christy Marx the creator of the original Jem series has a cameo as a journalist when what the movie could have used was her real - not fictional - writing skills.The films best (only?) twist was changing the male character of Eric Raymond - the original arch-rival of Jem and the Holograms - into Erica played with fierce power postures by Juliette Lewis. Lewis vamps through her scenes without the earnest chip of sincerity that the other characters are carrying around and she maintains a flair for the cartoonish that is sadly missing from the rest of the movie. For a film that bows down with such reverence to the Internet you would think that it might celebrate the multiple identities we share online instead of pining for authenticity. Its as if Erica is the only one in on the joke Jem and the Holograms is meant to be pure camp. Just throw on a wig and go with it.

"Review Jem and the Holograms in tune with girl power spirit - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Jem and the Holograms play with girl power spirit Jem and the Holograms Justina Mintz / Universal Studios Aja (Hayley Kiyoko) left Jem (Aubrey Peeples) and Kimber (Stefanie Scott) are foster-sisters-turned-band-mates in the playful ""Jem and the Holograms."" Aja (Hayley Kiyoko) left Jem (Aubrey Peeples) and Kimber (Stefanie Scott) are foster-sisters-turned-band-mates in the playful ""Jem and the Holograms."" (Justina Mintz / Universal Studios) Rebecca KeeganContact Reporter Its a compliment to director Jon M. Chu that I walked out of the ""Jem and the Holograms"" movie wanting to dot my review with a few pink heart emojis because I walked into the theater with a giant chip on my shoulder.The movie is based on a surprisingly subversive animated TV show writer Christy Marx created to help sell a line of Hasbro dolls in 1985. ""Jem and the Holograms"" which was better than it had any right to be combined a cool glam-rock aesthetic with a girl power theme making sweet music to this 80s kids ears. SIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter gt;gt;Though Chus movie sacrifices some of the TV shows appealing weirdness this ""Jem and the Holograms"" captures the fundamental spirit of female friendship and self-expression that made 1980s Jem a hit with daughters of ""Working Girl"" moms. In revisiting the pop rock quest of a multiracial group of adopted sisters in suburban California Chu has made a stylish and self-aware musical fantasy for the YouTube generation. Chus cast is lead by ""Nashvilles"" Aubrey Peeples who has a lilting singing voice and a winning warmth as the Holograms shy lead singer Jerrica/Jem but it is a devilish Juliette Lewis as the bands exploitative manager music magnate Erica Raymond who steals the show and gets many of the best lines in screenwriter Ryan Landels often witty script. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story Advising the girls on how to navigate their first red carpet Erica says wisely ""Look like youre having fun but dont really have any fun."" Critiquing the girls outfits she dismisses one as ""interesting if you live in the Valley"" and says of another ""reminds me of people trying to dress up their animals.""This playfully tart tone was not what I expected when I saw the video that Chu producer Jason Blum and music manager Scooter Braun released in 2014 announcing their live-action movie a patronizing piece of marketing that made me want to fling a can of Aqua Net across the room. Instead of introducing Jem to a new generation of girls they seemed to be there to explain her to a group of male consumer products executives with Chu clutching one of Hasbros dolls uncomfortably and Blum promising that ""cool moms"" knew the show. Apparently they couldnt find a single woman to stand in the background of their video and give the vaguest impression of female creative input. Celebrity photos taken by Los Angeles Times photographers. The filmmakers further irked Jems considerable African American fan base by casting a light-skinned actress in the role of Jerricas foster sister Shana who as a rare black female character on cartoons in the 1980s had given African American girls a chance to see themselves as they almost never did -- at the heart of the story. Fortunately Chu who has directed two ""Step Up"" movies a Justin Bieber concert film and another Hasbro toy-selling vehicle ""G.I. Joe Retaliation"" showed better instincts with his visual decision-making. With cinematographer Alice Brooks shooting in a Rainbow Brite lighting palette and makeup department head Mary Klimek deploying glitter and eye shadow like war paint Chu creates a fantasy world akin to being dropped in the middle of a Cyndi Lauper video. Girls still wanna have fun -- especially if they can show it on Instagram.Though its visual inspiration is 1980s to the core the film is set definitively in present day USA where a YouTube video gone viral has rocketed Jerrica who goes by Jem onstage to stardom.Chu intercuts videos of real would-be YouTube stars -- drummers singers quirky musicians of all types -- in the film a charming touch that nevertheless has the effect of pointing out how homogeneously perfect his young cast is. Real YouTubers have chubby cheeks blotchy skin big ears. No one in the Holograms is over a size 2 or has ever had a zit.The four band members are adopted sisters who live under the roof of kindly Aunt Bailey played by Molly Ringwald in a casting trick designed to appeal to 80s nostalgists (mission accomplished with this easy mark). Disney Channel star Stefanie Scott is Jerricas bubbly little sister Kimber; musician-actress Hayley Kiyoko is Aja the bands guitarist; and Aurora Perrineau is Shana the bass player. Aja and Shana get a few good lines in but this is really Jems show.As love interest Rio Ryan Guzman accomplishes the near impossible task of playing a heterosexual college-age male who delivers lines like ""Yes Jem is glamour and glitter fashion and fame"" with a straight face. Surely theres an Oscar for that.The movie is at its best when it embraces a campy knowing tone as when one character declares ""Youre Internet famous Thats the second best thing to being actually famous"" Delightfully the sisters capitalize on the worlds tendency to underestimate them distracting some security guards by pretending to need help taking the perfect photo (as if they would need help with that) and turning to one another to share a song when the going gets rough.Follow me on Twitter ThatRebecca------------Jem and the HologramsMPAA rating PG for thematic material including reckless behavior brief suggestive content and some languageRunning time 1 hour 58 minutesPlaying In wide release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Reviews Entertainment Movies Juliette Lewis Justin Bieber PG Rated Movies Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Back stories and mannerisms help Tatiana Maslany keep her many characters clearly defined TV viewership for Hillary Clintons acceptance speech is smaller than Donald Trumps Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad81deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-jem-review-20151023-story.html,200,jemandtheholograms7,jemandtheholograms,latimes

Credit Justina Mintz/Universal Studios There are a few sweet moments early in ""Jem and the Holograms"" as we are reintroduced to the long-dormant characters from the three-decade-old animated series and see how theyve been reimagined for a 2015 live-action film. But then the movies lumbering overstuffed unfocused plot shows up and whatever high hopes we might have had for this latest exploitation of 1980s nostalgia are slowly ground away.The ""Jem"" series which ran from 1985 to 1988 and is fondly remembered by many who were young girls then was a Hasbro product and the movie is too which puts it in the lineage of ""Battleship"" and the various ""Transformers"" among others. Its almost as noisy as those films because its about a girl band that finds Internet fame and apparently a pile of rejected Katy Perry orchestration. Photo Aubrey Peeples left with Juliette Lewis in the Jon Chu film. Credit Universal Studios As the story begins Jerrica (Aubrey Peeples of TVs ""Nashville"") and her sister Kimber (Stefanie Scott) are being raised by their aunt (Molly Ringwald) along with two foster children Aja (Hayley Kiyoko) and Shana (Aurora Perrineau). Kimber uploads a video of the painfully shy Jerrica singing identifying her only as ""Jem"" and it quickly goes viral. Starlight a record company run by the scheming Erica (Juliette Lewis) signs Jem with the other three girls as her backup band.Already fans of the animated series will be noticing variations on the original story in which Jerrica inherited part of Starlight and its charity a group home for foster girls when her father died. Here all that her father an inventor has left her is a robot that she calls Synergy which at first doesnt appear to work. In the cartoon Synergy had magical powers that transformed Jerrica into the flashy Jem; in the movie once Synergy finally wakes up and starts doing its thing its powers arent quite so fantastical. Video Movie Review Jem and the Holograms The Times critic Neil Genzlinger reviews ""Jem and the Holograms."" By AINARA TIEFENTHALER and ROBIN LINDSAY on Publish Date October 22 2015. . Watch in Times Video >> embed Instead the movie written by Ryan Landels and directed by Jon M. Chu uses Synergy as an excuse for a treasure hunt subplot in which the girls even as theyre riding the fame monster track down pieces of the robot that Dad for some reason left in hiding places years ago and that improbably are still there. But Synergy is just one thread in this undisciplined tangle. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Erica -- paging Yoko Ono -- wants to break up the band and make Jem a solo act. Ericas son Rio (Ryan Guzman) and Jem are flirting with romance. The girls aunt is having money problems. Jerrica is having identity problems -- am I me or my rock star alter ego? -- that were mined more engagingly in ""Hannah Montana."" Video Trailer Jem and the Holograms A preview of the film. By Universal Pictures on Publish Date May 15 2015. Image courtesy of Internet Video Archive. Watch in Times Video >> embed The movie doesnt put enough effort into any of these subplots; it seems to be merely tossing ideas into the pot that it thinks might appeal to 9-year-olds. Its biggest sin though is to miss the girl-power allure of the cartoon in which Jerrica in addition to being a rock star was also a businesswoman. Instead it grabs for the YouTube generation by making Jem a heroine for every kid who has ever been fat-shamed had parents who dont listen has been anxious about sexual identity and so on. Homemade-looking videos thanking Jem for giving voice to their concerns through her bland songs keep cropping up to try to sell this conceit. Both parents who loved the cartoon and their young children will see through this manipulation. If you hate spoilers stop reading now In case you were wondering what ever happened to the Misfits the rival band that gave the animated series its driving dynamic they eventually turn up here though if youre in a hurry to leave the theater -- which would be understandable -- you might miss them.""Jem and the Holograms"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) because theres a certain recklessness to the rock star life.

Photo Universal Studios MOVIE REVIEW Jem and the Holograms Running time 118 minutes. Rated PG (nothing offensive). Jem and the Holograms"" takes place in a magical land where one viral song can land you something called a ""recording contract"" from a ""music executive"" so powerful she regularly holds major press conferences. I dont know whether the kids will buy any of this. Im still giddy from watching Molly Ringwald and Juliette Lewis throw shade at each other in this featherweight update of the 80s cartoon about a girl living a double life as a rock star -- the proto-Hannah Montana. Aubrey Peeples (""Nashville"") is likable enough as Jerrica Benton/Jem who harmonizes at home with her sibling Kimber (Stefanie Scott) and stylish foster sisters Aja (Hayley Kiyoko) and Shana (Aurora Perrineau) under the watchful eye of their Aunt Bailey (Ringwald). When a video of the shy Jerrica performing as ""Jem"" gets uploaded the world inexplicably goes bananas. Soon ""The Erica Raymond"" (Lewis) villainous media mogul is spiriting the girl band away for a makeover and as an afterthought some rehearsals before their big debut under the watchful eye of hottie handler Rio (Ryan Guzman). That Jerrica/Jem also totes around an adorable chirping robot called Synergy will be comfort food to anyone old enough to have seen ""Short Circuit"" and Im betting perplexing to the tweens -- whose tolerance for this movie will directly correlate to their liking of glittery eye makeup and generic positive-message pop. Director Jon Chu stretches ""Jem"" to a ridiculous 2 hours via endless amateur-musician YouTube clips. Anyone can be a star they attest -- and always be yourself (Except when youre Jem. I guess.) Fans of the cartoon should stick around for Lewis after-credits sequence which introduces a dastardly rival band. Its the movies best scene setting up a sequel well never see.

Justina Mintz /Courtesy of Universal Pictures hide caption toggle caption Justina Mintz /Courtesy of Universal Pictures Aja (Hayley Kiyoko from left) Jem (Aubrey Peeples) and Kimber (Stefanie Scott) in a scene from Jem and the Holograms. Justina Mintz /Courtesy of Universal Pictures ""Somethings happening on the Internet"" yelps Kimber to her shy older sister Jerrica Benton the instant pop sensation known as ""Jem"" in the live-action version of Christy Marxs mid-80s cartoon staple Jem and the Holograms. Kimber is delighting over an acoustic video gone viral but the line aptly describes the modus operandi of the filmmakers who are desperate to tap into the preteen zeitgeist but havent got a clue how to do it. From what they can gather the Internet is a series of tubes connected by hashtag-dealing vloggers who will surely love the movie if they feel validated by it. The film is a cynical marketing plan set to music as if director John M. Chu and his (all-male) producers and writer came away from Josie and the Pussycats thinking Parker Poseys music-biz CEO was the hero. Thats not all Jem takes from Josie. Ryan Landels script lifts the premise almost beat for beat -- teen musician becomes overnight sensation signs a Faustian deal with a slick-talking label executive (Juliette Lewis in the Posey role) and loses her bandmates in a bid for solo stardom. But the film loses the catchy soundtrack the candy-colored production design and the satire on a culture geared toward turning kids into consumerist zombies. Few critics gave Josie enough credit for cleverly subverting the teen-pop musical but Jem preys so rapaciously on its target demographic that it holds the virtues of the earlier film in sharp relief. Jem and the Holograms is Mac and Me to Josie and the Pussycats E.T. Yet another in a regrettable trend of franchise-starting origin stories Jem follows Jerrica/Jem her Instagram/YouTube-crazy sister Kimber and their foster sisters Aja (Hayley Kiyoko) and Shana (Aurora Perrineau) on the fast track to musical fame. After Jerrica records a heartfelt song in her room -- hiding her face under a pink wig and her identity under the nom de rock Jem -- Kimber secretly posts it online and it immediately attracts interest from Starlight Enterprises honcho Erica Raymond (Lewis). With Jerrica eager to make money to save her aunt and the quartets adoptive mother (Molly Ringwald) from foreclosure she gets coerced into Raymonds plan to make her a solo act. Thats plenty of intrigue for one 90-minute confection but Jem and the Holograms is a full two hours and has much more tedious narrative business on the agenda. It would seem that Jerricas late father an inventor bequeathed to her a hologram-projecting robot named Synergy who wont work until Jerrica finds three missing pieces each hidden in a hard-to-access location. Her mission should she choose to accept it is to waste an hour of screen time following clues so her dad can appear like Obi-Wan Kenobi (or Will.I.Am). Synergy has a critical role in Marxs show -- as does the rival band The Misfits who are only teased for the wildly optimistic prospect of a sequel -- but the bleeping robot does nothing that a simple letter couldnt do. Its just something to keep Jerrica and her friends busy. Chu directed the Justin Bieber doc Never Say Never -- Bieber management svengali Scooter Braun co-produces here too -- and made the second and third Step Up movies and he attempts to find a choreography between Jems music and the homemade sounds of YouTube artists. But the overall effect is to sell teenagers on the lie that theyre creatively invested in this boondoggle -- that they are ""Jem"" just as much as Jerrica is. In fact Jem and the Holograms is so committed to the concept that it looks like an online video washed out in a low-resolution gray that exposes its exceptionally modest 5 million budget. Something will definitely happen on the Internet when the film hits theaters. Useful advice to the filmmakers Dont read the comments. Correction Oct. 22 2015 A previous version of this review incorrectly said Erica Raymond is portrayed by Parker Posey in the movie. The character is actually played by Juliette Lewis.

Chu Written by Ryan Landels Duration 118 minutes Remember Jem? The 80s cartoon about a ""truly outrageous"" rock star and girl band that lived a double life with secret identities? If not then youre probably closer to my age than to the target audience of the muddled and lame 21st century live-action reboot Jem and the Holograms. Brought to you by the director and producers of the 2011 documentary Justin Bieber Never Say Never its clear where they got the idea of using YouTube as the star-making plot device that would translate that 80s anachronism for a tween girl audience. Great idea - social media double lives sock puppets things going viral. Too bad they dont really run with it. After a few crackling resonant digital-age scenes in the opening act the filmmakers settle in and make Jem into a mediocre Disney Channel movie - with for no good reason a pet robot. What theyve kept from the original series is the truly outrageous makeup and hair and the premise of a band of ""sisters."" Jerrica (Nashvilles Audrey Peeples) and her blood sister Kimber (Stefanie Scott) live in nowhere-California with their Aunt Bailey and their two foster sisters Shana and Aja (Aurora Perrineau and Hayley Kiyoko). All have a musical bent - and short-hand movie personalities (the computer nerd the fashionista the social networker etc.) - but its Kimber who tricks Jerrica into posting a song called Alone Together on YouTube under the fake name of Jem. And it goes viral. This part is believable enough (Jerrica is told shes as famous as ""the water-skiing squirrel"") and the movie is peppered with authentic-looking YouTube videos of in-house musical prodigies which lends an air of verisimilitude. But then the plot leaves the planet. Inexplicably everybody loves Jem (and not in an apparently creepy way). Finding her becomes a big deal that crosses over into the mainstream media. And the one who finally does is an evil corporate talent mogul named Erica Raymond admirably overplayed by Juliette Lewis. Erica - and her determination that Jem leave her sisters and become a solo act - is unfortunately as far as the drama goes. The TV series had heroes and villains (a bad-girl band called The Misfits whose slogan was ""Our songs are better""). To my mind a Jem movie without the Misfits is like Batman without The Joker. Theres a suggestion in the credits of a sequel with them but unless this Jem is a hit theyve missed their chance. So theres a road to stardom kids are unlikely to buy. The drama consists entirely of whether or not Jem/Jerrica will stay true to herselves (whoever they are) a lot of sisterly hugging and a sort-of love affair with Ericas son Rio (Ryan Guzman) which may or may not be age-appropriate (were never sure how old the girls are). Oh and yeah the robot. Seems Jerricas deceased dad doted on his daughter and created a Wall-E-like robot as his legacy that would reactivate when she returned to her hometown of Los Angeles and lead her on a hunt for clues to a secret message. For all this there is precious little music in the movie. A few scenes in the studio where the girls discover their sound instruments in hand would have been interesting. Instead the highly produced tunes emerge from them out of nowhere like an episode of Glee. Thats stardom in the digital age. It just happens.

Nothing outrageous about dull Jem review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesNothing outrageous about dull Jem reviewThe 1980s cartoon Jem gets a reboot for the YouTube generation as Jem and the Holograms.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Oct. 22 2015Jem and the HologramsStarring Aubrey Peeples Stefanie Scott Juliette Lewis and Molly Ringwald. Directed by Jon M. Chu. 118 minutes. Opening Friday at major theatres. GJem has lost her outrageousness and gained a robotic sidekick in an overlong low-budget big-screen reboot of the 1980s toy-selling cartoon series.While Jem and the Holograms may strike a chord with its target preteen audience it certainly doesnt accomplish that with memorable music. And Jems going to have a tough time winning over those seeking a hit of shoulder pad and pink hair nostalgia in this lifeless copy.Article Continued BelowIts been updated to rely on the instant star power of a viral video by Scooter Braun (Justin Biebers manager) and Bieber documentarian director Jon M. Chu (G.I. Joe Retaliation) who know via the Biebs discovery that YouTube dreams really do come true.Stefanie Scott Aubrey Peeples Hayley Kiyoko and Aurora Perrineau in Jem and the Holograms.  (Justina Mintz / Universal Pictures)  Nashvilles Aubrey Peeples is a likeable Jerrica Benton who lives with her three sisters with nurturing Aunt Bailey (Molly Ringwald still working that retro chic). Jerrica is a camera-shy warbler whose in-disguise vocal video as Jem goes viral overnight thanks to meddling sister Kimber (Stefanie Scott). Jem catches the eye of music exec Erica Raymond (a sublimely craven Juliette Lewis) who specializes in manufactured pop and sees a big future for a mystery singer in an over-sharing world.Jerrica insists sisters Kimber Aja (Hayley Kiyoko) and Shana (Aurora Perrineau) be her backup band and the four are off to L.A. to live like rock stars chaperoned by hunky record company intern Rio (Ryan Guzman).Cue the makeup and fashion montage. Instantly not only is Jem rocking out onstage with a series of bland synth-pop tunes shes also the most influential singer in the world. Hologram-generating super computer Synergy also gets an update becoming an R2-D2-like robot helpmate for Jem who still needs those fierce purple earrings to make things happen.Its also jammed with cameos including a post-credits sequel-hinting appearance by Kesha as Pizzazz leader of rival band the Misfits.Verging on two hours Jem hammers home messages about believing in yourself (even if you have a secret identity) along with social media wisdoms that are big on emotion but light on sincerity.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Comments click to enlarge Jem and the Holograms Video Rated PG  118 minutes  2015 Four teenage sisters create an amateur music video that becomes an Internet sensation and a record company president (Juliette Lewis) recruits them to form a pop group. Dumb but inoffensive this family-friendly musical charts the sisters transformation from ordinary girls to glamorous pop stars showing how they get made over in LA and trained to perform for large audiences. Along the way they learn lessons about the duplicitous behavior of record executives (sure to mean little to kids in the audience) and the importance of being themselves. Jon M. Chu who directed the concert doc Justin Bieber Never Say Never maintains a lively pace and theres some cute business involving a robot that communicates through music.

Aubrey Peeples playing the singer even gets a sort of Tom Joad speech in the final minutes explaining that Jem is all of us and any of us that shell be there when we need her. Thats heartening -- heres hoping that if fans claim the songs and the identity the copyright holders remain supportive. And the filmmakers have done the Jem-faithful the strangest of favors The production values here are pretty much what yours would be if you re-shot the movie yourself on some iPhones.All that adventure/excitement and fashion/fame promised in the Eighties cartoon shows theme song proves beyond the budgetary scope of this iteration which is mostly a series of fumbled close-ups of the star and her band/sisters as a wicked manager (Juliette Lewis) endeavors to make them over and fully monetize Jems talent.Film Details Jem and the Holograms RatingPG GenreAction/Adventure Running Time118 min. More Info Trailer That managers goal lift Jem from internet-famous to famous-famous a distinction that the movie highlights in its on-the-cheap way. You know how in most rise-of-a-pop-star films you get a flashbulb montage packed venues screaming fans red-carpet life? Here theres a much more cost-effective sequence of close-ups of computer screens where numbers of shares and likes keep booming. Its witty and even thoughtful especially when a video of Jem becomes a viral sensation before that manager shows up Here she is the talk of the internet a talent kids are weeping over but shes still broke and sleepy and dressed for the suburbs.The movies poky and confused never clearly setting up its conflicts and blowing far too much of its running time on a National Treasure clue-hunt for messages Jems father programmed into a sassy dancing robot. Were supposed to consider it a travesty when the manager tries to peel Jem off from her sisters/bandmates and fashion her into a solo star but Jem never bothers to show us why those (eventual) Holograms matter -- we never see rehearsals or who writes the songs or anything of their creative process. The songs sung well by Peeples are rousing but not so much that the worlds immediate embrace of Jem makes clear sense. Director Jon M. Chu splices in YouTube clips of real-life fans gushing about how Hasbros Jem character changed their lives and that passion is queasily incongruent with the earnest low-key young star of the movie. He also cuts at times to unrelated videos of YouTubers performing interesting feats of percussion; the score smartly incorporates these beats but some older viewers may be left wondering ""Hey are those guys banging on tubs of kitty-litter in the next room? Are they part of the story?""As on Nashville where her singing is a highlight Peeples plays a smart but gloomy cookie wary of the press and the public but eager to be an artist. Here though her everyday character gets to escape into the fantasy of Jem even if shes reluctant to do so The films best moment is a barely lit examination of her touching up a band of red makeup smeared over her eyes. Shes brooding confused stuck somewhere between real person and Gaga. Too bad though that the conflicts this soulful performer is asked to embody are otherwise so generic.Chu and screenwriter Ryan Landelss take on fame is more fascinating than most of the films drab slow drama. Jem mixes the anti-sellout fears of earlier generations with the everybody-is-a-star ethos of the YouTube era. The script has enough sharp edges to keep getting your hopes up that everything might come together -- might truly become outrageous.One highlight this exchange as Jem and company watch her first video storm the internet. ""They love her"" one gushes staring at a laptop. Then only slightly surprised ""Except that guy. And that one."" Lewis is terrifically funny as a callow shallow biz-type but its the truth of that scene -- and the prevalence of such online hate -- that offers reason to hope that Jem hits enough to be improved upon in a sequel. Yes its message -- ""Be yourself by being Jem"" -- is kind of nuts but for real anything that helps these kids find themselves makes this world better.A warning to superfans of the cartoon This is another of those reboots where the premise of the original isnt really established until the very last scene. Also all the supernatural weirdness is gone.Jem and the Holograms Directed by Jon M.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Made on the cheap the live-action adaptation of the popular 80s cartoon Jem And The Holograms often resembles a mockbuster of itself perhaps titled Jam And The Horoglams and distributed directly to gas stations. Applying the style (or lack thereof) of his earlier Justin Bieber Never Say Never to marginally more fictional material director Jon M. Chu shrouds pop singer Jem--formerly a record company executive now a mystery-solving suburban teen with a robot sidekick--behind celebrity testimonials and scads of non-original footage most of it sourced from YouTube videos. Factor in a plot that involves wills contracts and a futuristic technology that is never actually shown as well as a setting of generic real-estate catalog interiors and suspiciously small concert venues and the result begins to look a bit like the Hasbro equivalent of Atlas Shrugged Part III. Its one saving grace is that Chus direction is so wildly inconsistent that it manages to produce a handful of genuinely gorgeous images alongside all of the cruddy ones. Aubrey Peeples stars as 18-year-old Jerrica Benton who performs tuneless imitations of pop music as her pink-haired alter-ego Jem. In the animated version this transformation was accomplished with the help of holographic projectors concealed in star-shaped earrings; presumably for reasons of budget the movie just has her put on a wig. Having become a global sensation on the strength of a viral video that features her glumly strumming an acoustic guitar in Aladdin Sane makeup Jerrica travels to Los Angeles with her backing band which consists of her sister and her aunts two foster daughters and which in true modern-day origin story fashion isnt called The Holograms until the last minute of the movie. They are there on the invitation of music mogul Erica Raymond (Juliette Lewis) who believes that keeping Jems true identity secret is the key to her mystique despite the fact that almost everyone in Jem And The Holograms knows that shes Jerrica. Gaps of logic are not unwarranted in an adaptation of a Reagan-era cartoon originally produced by a toy company; however that does not excuse the fact that Jem And The Holograms often looks like shit. Chus work on the Step Up movies helped revitalize the American dance film but dance is just about the only thing he can direct and Jem And The Holograms are not dancers. What viewers get is a nearly two-hour musical with a total of five musical numbers paced with the excitement of someone looking for their keys that consists in part of rushed indifferent handheld close-ups occasionally overlaid with motion-tracked pop-ups of social media text and clips of YouTubers talking about the animated series. This air of apathy is made bizarre by the plotting which starts with a daughter losing a father and ends with a son having his mother escorted away by security and has Jerrica deciphering clues with the help of her bandmates and a bleep-bloopy ball-bot that responds to whistle commands. The underlying idea of musicals is that song is an expression but the generic music of Jem And The Holograms doesnt come from anywhere and with the exception of that ostensibly career-launching viral video it never feels like its being sung or performed by the people on screen. It doesnt help that the music is also boring. Chu who produced the film with horror impresario Jason Blum and Justin Bieber manager Scooter Braun reportedly opted for a low budget to ensure full creative control but Jem shows absolutely no control and only the most fitful and frustrating sparks of unmotivated creativity. There is a beautiful scene here of the main characters swimming underwater in slow motion lit by the flashing neon lights of the Santa Monica Piers Ferris wheel and it seems to come from a completely different more stylized universe--perhaps the one where Jem And The Holograms belong.

The musicians arent always talented and the good guys dont always win but this is a plot that encompasses a wide field from glossy fun like ""Josie and the Pussycats"" ""Spice World"" and ""Starstruck"" to more serious fare like ""Ladies and Gentlemen the Fabulous Stains"" ""Breaking Glass"" and ""We Are the Best"" ""Jem and the Holograms"" a reboot of the popular 1980s TV cartoon doesnt quite reach the heights of any of those movies but while watching this new musical its at least clear that director Jon M. Chu (""Justin Bieber Never Say Never"" ""Step Up 3D"") and screenwriter Ryan Landels like those movies too. This new ""Jem"" might be pure cubic zirconium but that doesnt mean it cant be part of a fun night out. See Video Jem and the Holograms Trailer Downgrades Synergy From Glam Computer to Tiny Robot In this version of the tale sisters Jerrica (Aubrey Peeples ""Nashville"") and Kimber (Stefanie Scott) are orphans being raised by their beloved Aunt Bailey (Molly Ringwald) whos already foster parent to Shana (Aurora Perrineau) and Aja (Hayley Kiyoko ""CSI Cyber""). Jerrica writes songs but keeps them a secret until Kimber convinces her to record one of her compositions on video while wearing some of Baileys vintage wigs and makeup. The clip goes online and Jerrica -- who performed the tune using the pseudonym ""Jem"" -- suddenly becomes the webs most viral video sensation since the water-skiing squirrel. Record mogul Erica Raymond (Juliette Lewis) swoops in to make a deal and Jerrica eventually signs only because Bailey is facing foreclosure on her house. Also Read Scooter Braun on Why Even Jem and the Holograms Haters Will Cry at End of Live Action Reboot The four girls are swept into the glamorous rock lifestyle under the supervision of Rio (Ryan Guzman ""The Boy Next Door"") but while hes supposedly keeping a close eye on the quartet they cant help sneaking out. It turns out you see that the seemingly useless robot that Jerrica and Kimbers dad built years ago comes to life when the ladies leave the deep valley and journey into Los Angeles proper. The robot named Synergy starts providing clues that dear old dead dad apparently hid years ago for his progeny. There are wacky shenanigans and attempts to separate Jerrica from her bandmates (leading to a reunion scene nearly identical to the one in ""Spice World"") and racing to get to that concert on time but to get caught up in the plot of ""Jem and the Holograms"" is mostly to miss the point. Even though I wish the songs themselves were stronger -- there are a few catchy tunes to be found but the YouTube ditty that makes Jem an instant star isnt one of them -- theres an energy and a vibrancy to the movie that its young target audience will appreciate. In keeping with the movies online aesthetic Chu uses music posted to YouTube by amateur musicians as part of the propulsive score and interviews with Jem fans that were clearly filmed on laptops in bedrooms across America. It sounds gimmicky but the results are quite organic. For those of us who already had drivers licenses by the time ""Jem"" premiered on TV theres the always-welcome prospect of seeing Ringwald on the big screen and even though shes graduated from ingenue to mom she still gives some of the greatest scrunched-lip comedy in the business. Lewis has fun tearing into her wickedly villainous role and Guzmans just-out-of-the-shower scene elicited gasps across the age and gender range of the screening I attended. Also Read Jem and the Holograms Trailer Trashed by Original Fans of Animated Series As for our four leads Peeples believably transforms from shy singer-songwriter type to brash and colorful pop diva. The other three alas are saddled with such sketchy roles (Kimber likes social media Ajas a hacker) and so little screen time that they arent given much of an opportunity to make any kind of impression. If youre a hard-core ""Jem"" fan whos still mad that Synergy is no longer a super-computer and that the rival band The Misfits are nowhere to be found (stick around after the credits Im just saying) you wont be won over by this reimagining of the material. But if you never had much investment in the Holograms and arent expecting any singles as great as ""Three Small Words"" from ""Josie and the Pussycats"" you may find this bubblegum musical more of a toe-tapper than you might have imagined.

A campy cartoon encapsulating 80s excess transforms into an earnest live-action ode to the navel-gazing YouTube generation in ""Jem and the Holograms."" Considerably less fun than any paper-thin ""Star Is Born"" ripoff has any right to be this low-budget collaboration between ""Step Up"" sequel director Jon M. Chu horror producer Jason Blum and Justin Bieber manager Scooter Braun exists only because of nostalgia for the animated source material. And yet the film seems inexplicably embarrassed by its roots instead serving up half-baked and self-consciously contemporary drama that no one in the sure-to-be minimal theatrical audience will remember quite so fondly some 30 years on. Similarities between the live-action and animated ""Jem"" pretty much begin and end with character names but both revolve around talented young singer Jerrica Benton (played here by Aubrey Peeples) who becomes a pop superstar under the stage name Jem. In the film YouTube is her ticket to success when social media-savvy younger sister Kimber (Stefanie Scott) secretly uploads an acoustic performance Jerrica/Jem filmed in her bedroom and the clip immediately goes viral. Shrouded in a layer of secrecy uncommon in the ""share it all"" age Jems debut performance attracts the attention of powerful music mogul Erica Raymond (Juliette Lewis) who whisks Jerrica away from her hardworking Aunt Bailey (Molly Ringwald) and promises the world. Jerrica insists on bringing along Kimber and their interchangeable foster sisters Shana (Aurora Perrineau) and Aja (Hayley Kiyoko) as her backing band and Erica places them all under the watchful eye of her dutiful son Rio (Ryan Guzman). As Erica schemes to extract Jerrica from her sisters so Jem can become a proper solo star Jerrica falls for Rio and tries to ensure that Aunt Bailey wont lose her house or her business. She also slowly pieces together a puzzle left behind by her late father in the form of a pint-sized robot called Synergy. Thats about all the film offers in terms of plot even as the running time pushes toward an excruciating and borderline inexcusable two hours. Perhaps a few killer musical numbers wouldve helped move things along -- and explain how exactly Jem becomes such a global sensation that shes deluged with virtual messages professing that her music saves lives and empowers an army of fans -- but even Jems performances are limited to just a handful of scenes. And whether due to budgetary limitations or simple failure of imagination theyre remarkably low-energy affairs staged in front of what seems like dozens of extras (standing in for Jems supposed thousands of fans). Its no wonder the cartoons absurdly catchy theme song ""Truly Outrageous"" is never heard here (outside of a few wink-wink lines of dialogue spoken by Guzman). Theres nothing ""outrageous"" about Chus painfully pedestrian work. He seems to be striving for the forced-inspirational tone of his dual Bieber documentaries ""Never Say Never"" and ""Believe"" but those films played off a pre-existing persona with a carefully crafted image to sell. It turns out its much more difficult to manufacture a faux-superstar from scratch. As much as Jerrica drones on about finding her authentic self through her music the movie never allows her a moment that feels remotely real. Against all odds ""Nashville"" series regular Peeples keeps the film watchable delivering a capable star turn with enough flashes of soul to belie the scripts artifice and credible pop vocals to boot. Towering over a lackluster supporting cast the always welcome Lewis imbues a nonsensical bitch-on-wheels caricature with offbeat line readings and live-wire energy. A generally unremarkable tech package at least provides a modest showcase for costume designer Soyon An makeup head Mary Klimek and hairstylist Vanessa Price who come the closest to channeling the vibrant spirit of the ""Jem"" cartoons that originally made fans fall in love.

Marcy Horgan says April 4 2016 at 1149 pm I grew up on Jem and so I feared that the movie would kinda ruin my memories of the show. However I LOVED THE MOVIE. I have nothing bad to say at all. My almost 6yr old daughter has watched it 3 times lol In this day and age girls need to be around people and experiences that build their Self Esteem . Reply Lisa says November 13 2015 at 829 pm s a die hard jem fan now well into my 30s. The disappointment was them changing it and trying to target teens who dont now who Jem is unless its in teletoon retro or google. Loving the cheesey cartoon brings back good feelings. Use movie magic to bring holograms to life but keep characters the same and throwing in a updated version of the songs will only make true fans happy. The original series never showed us if Jerrica told Rio she was Jem. It was unfinished Hollywood listen up If you are thinking of doing anymore films with a big fan following. Keep it as close to the original as possible and give us what we want. You want to make a movie but just use the name to hook us fans well its gonna turn out just like this. Flip. Flop. I could write and direct this better then these professionals. Now who wants to hire me? Reply Christopher James Wynn says November 1 2015 at 357 pm Interesting how hard this reviewer worked to find positives about this film going as far as to praise the make-up artist to give some kind of balance...and of course failing to do so. Jem and the Holograms FYI is a one-season 1980s cartoon developed by Sunbow (Marvel Comics animation department of the time). Specifically made to sell Barbie-like dolls to girls and enter the same market G.I.Joe and He-Man created it was an action/musical series about a young woman using a holographic program left by her dead father to become a pop star and lead a band. The episodes were usually based around the band trying to have a concert while solving a mystery/crime/terrorists/charity/whatever while also trying to keep their rivals (The Misfits) from ruining things. THIS film is more like a poorly-veiled Miley Cyrus biopic some kid that suddenly gains fame and is forced into a lifestyle she doesnt really want. Beyond names the film has almost nothing to do with the series (which removes the small fan base that would have bought tickets) and parents of young girls (who hate Miley and will not pay to let their kids watch such tripe). Not even bothering to put in the one memorable thing about the old show (the title song) pretty much tells any audience that the studio and/or director has nothing but contempt to the source material. That is never a good way to start a new fanbase. Sometimes when you have something as silly as a hologram-using popstar action series you just got to own up to it. See Guardians of the Galaxy. Instead of pre-teens maybe they should have just gone for broke and used 20-somethings in the 1980s did the crazy hair and costumes and just went nuts. This is obviously a watered-down waste of time and money. Reply Justine says October 24 2015 at 222 pm My childhood is suffocating barely breathing for air with the release of this film. It makes no sense to make a movie about such a beloved toy/cartoon for little girls everywhere; only to eschew any and all references to its origins? Reply lindsay says November 11 2015 at 235 am Also Jem wasnt created to sell dolls. The dolls came out due to the popularity of the series. Ya know like Sailor Moon Frozen ect. You dont think that Walt Disney made ""Frozen "" just to sell Elsa dolls do you? P.S. you are talking to a 37 year old Jem fanatic that watched the show so religiously as a kid that i remembered the words to ""Like a dream"" for 20 years so I think I know a little something about it. You ARE correct about the synopsis of the show though. Reply lindsay says November 11 2015 at 221 am Jem was a one season show huh? Uh.....sure if you consider 1985 to 1988 ""one season"". You obviously have no idea what your talking about and are just regurgitating FALSE information that youve read elsewhere. Reply CF Sista says October 23 2015 at 903 pm I didnt support this mess of a movie; however if the creators would have stuck to the original story line all the kids of the 80s would have FLOODED THE THEATERS. I kid you not even someone like myself who dislikes movie going in general. But nooo.....lets try to make an old school 80s cartoon appeal to millennials WRONG WRONG RIO IS ERICA RAYMONDS SON? Based off of Rios appearance and last name he was either Latino or Italian in the cartoon and a neighbor of The Bentons He was NEVER related to Eric Raymond STRAIGHT TO DVD Reply Fern says October 23 2015 at 1217 pm The trailers for this movie are atrocious The director is just cashing in on the name brand. This generic movie has nothing to do with nor resemble the 80s cartoon. Reply a true 80s fan says October 23 2015 at 619 am This review was far too generous. I give the movie a 0 out of 10. the trailers for this movie were terrible and seeing the movie didnt change my mind either. I seen the show when I was little as I would wait for transformers and gi joe. the show was good for its time and can still stand up. it had a lot of good points to make it stand out and this movie took none of that at all. this used the names only this movie was terrible and a slap in the face to any male or female that liked the show this was nothing more than a reboot of Hannah Montana (which was a basic rip of jem) which would have been a far better title and made more sense as all jerrica did was put on a wig and make up. that is right true fans no holograms this movie had only one hologram near the end with her father and that was it the synergy though was a good thought to make the computer smaller but why would you make it like a wallie or bb8? and it didnt talk just whistled and toned like R2D2 all the advanced items listed in the robot and you dont put in a voice? COME ON AND NO MISFITS??? they are the main villains of the show you dont put the main villains in an end credit scene.do you put the decepticons in the end of a transformers movie and make the movie work? NO the same goes for cobra and why would you let rio know that jem and jerrica were the same person right off the bat? that was another thing of the show this was a poorly written and made movie plain and simple. even the parts of the movie that were supposed to be a plot twists didnt last long enough for you to care about as they were overcome in less than 2 minutes chu and the others didnt give one iota about the material they just wanted to make another movie and just cobbled together parts of thier other movies. there was a lot from the tv show they could have pulled from with plenty of material to make a sequel or two easily. and I am not even a big jem fan (but I love 80s cartoons) but I am still so mad that this crap of a movie is what Hollywood feels is the best they could come up with for an 80s cartoon I hear chu is supposed to be doing the new HE-MAN movie. if this is the best he can do then I am not looking forward to that movie either. Reply Autumn (autumnh75) says October 24 2015 at 1021 am Funny that you mention Hannah Montana because now that I think of it Miley Cyrus more recent incarnation is probably closer in attitude to the original cartoon Jem than this version...who seems to be a more Lizzie McGuire/Hannah Montana (or an even more milquetoast) Jem. lol smh. Reply Christina says October 22 2015 at 241 pm Rio is Erica Raymonds son...........that is just weird and so wrong so very wrong. I can honestly say that there is nothing to what I have seen or read that makes me want to see this movie. I think I will keep the Jem and Holograms from youth the way I remember it fun times with my sisters.

Justina Mintz Universal Pictures i By Katie Walsh Tribune News Service The beloved 1980s cartoon series ""Jem and the Holograms"" gets a millennial makeover in the live-action film of the same name. Director Jon M. Chu of several ""Step Up"" installments as well as the ""G.I. Joe"" live-action franchise adapts the kooky cartoon about a girl band with special futuristic powers to the YouTube generation where anyone can be a star. With a strong self-empowerment message ""Jem and the Holograms"" shoots squarely for a tween audience as well as those older fans who have nostalgia for the cartoon of their childhoods. The updated ""Jem and the Holograms"" explores the conflict between the world of new self-made Internet stars and legacy industries like the recording business. Director Chu uses a mixed-media approach with confessional video blogs homemade music videos and even Google Earth woven into the film nodding toward a found-footage aesthetic. Young Jerrica Benton (Aubrey Peeples) finds herself going viral after her sister Kimber (Stefanie Scott) uploads a video of Jerrica singing a song she wrote performing as alter-ego Jem. While fans are clamoring to know who Jem is the music biz is also calling. Jerrica decides to take Starlight Music mogul Erica Raymond (Juliette Lewis) up on her offer of stardom - with her sisters as her backup band. Erica gives the girls a full makeover and soon the teens are rocking the stage looking like a colorful teenage girl version of Kiss. But Jerrica resists the studios control. In a world where anyone can upload a video of themselves this old-fashioned and inauthentic model of stardom just isnt going to fly with the kids today. The film is incredibly faithful to its source material which results in a few titters of recognition when the original theme songs lyrics are peppered into the dialogue. But Chu has also chosen to include Synergy the robot created by Jerricas father before his death. In the cartoon synergy is a giant synthesizer that allows Jem to change her appearance and create realistic holograms with her truly outrageous earrings. The movie Synergy is a mini robot that sends her on a wild scavenger hunt finding clues placed by her father. Because the film is a bit more rooted in reality than the cartoon the robot subplot doesnt quite fit and pays off only in life lessons that Jem herself has already learned. The old vs. new theme becomes a visual motif that Chu leans into throughout sometimes to the detriment of the story and character-building. He intercuts tense moments with YouTube videos of drumming or step teams which feels gimmicky and distracts from the moment. Instagram-style videos offer looks into Jems emotional resonance with fans but not enough is put into explaining her meteoric rise.
