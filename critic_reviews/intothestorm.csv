"Small(er) Movies Roundup Frank The Giver and More << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Small(er) Movies Roundup Frank The Giver and More Movies August 19 2014 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Because not even the worst movie here is worse than Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Expendables 3. The Hundred-Foot Journey directed by Lasse Hallstrom Just appalling. A family of Mumbai asylum seekers settle in a French village. They open their funky soul-food restaurant right across the road from the snootiest joint in all the land. Om Puri runs the Indian place. Helen Mirren is his clenched Gallic rival. If the movie has to exist at all it ought to be a duel between these two actors -- her soupy accent versus his root vegetable of a nose. It is instead a tale of assimilation in which the talents of the old Indians son (Manish Dayal) become too much for the old Frenchy to resist. She must have him in her kitchen and inculcate him with the sort of national culinary traditions that will land him fame in Paris where a kind of Iron Chef-Modernist Cuisine hell awaits (the dust the foam the facial stubble). Theres a way in which the movies can make progress seem totally backward. The young man is all too happy to oblige having already won the local lovely (Charlotte Le Bon) who wears perfectly tailored floral-print dresses and rides the sort of cute basketed bike that non-French movies always put French women on. Of course she works in Madame Mirrens kitchen where her envy over her bosss preference for her new pal temporarily compromises their relationship. Hallstroms confusion of tastelessness with tastefulness strikes again. (Perhaps youve seen Chocolat or The Cider House Rules or Salmon Fishing in the Yemen.) Another instance comes in the idea that what boring-old French cooking needs is lots and lots of spices. But my favorite is the scene in which a shot of the Indians kitchen-wise matriarch burning alive in a politically ignited fire promptly gives way to a shot of sizzling shellfish. If the movie is high on gastronomy it also redefines cooking with gas. Mood Indigo directed by Michel Gondry How is it possible that weve given up on Gondry already? Is one bad blockbuster (2011s Green Hornet) all it takes? His last two films -- the dreamed-realist docudrama The We and the I and the realist-dreamed docu-toon Is the Man Who Is Tall Happy? -- came and went in the U.S. and the same fate appears to await this new movie a romantic dramedy. Its a crime. The first hour might be the loveliest youll see all year. Romain Duris and Audrey Tautou meet at a party. They dance fall in love get married and live happily until she gets sick. Sounds ordinary but this is the same man who made both literal and surreal Jim Carreys melancholy for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. He invented the civil agreement for moviegoing as community organization in Be Kind Rewind. He put a lot of Kylie Minogues on an ever-looping city block for her ""Come Into My World"" video. Here formal ingenuity and production design come at you so fast that to watch it is to be Lucy and Ethel at the chocolate factory stuffing candy into your pockets and inside your bra and down your throat. Duris and Tautou leap from his loft bed in pajamas and land on the floor fully dressed for the day. When Charlotte Le Bon (far better used than in The Hundred-Foot Journey) gets a load of Duriss friend and amanuensis (Omar Sy) she drops the tray she is holding and the camera cuts to her feet slipping on it cartoon-style until shes got the momentum to sail in his direction and attack him with kisses. But all the blisses of this movie wipe you out. The first hour is so happily innovative with its Richard Lester zip and the last half-hour so forlorn (the Jean-Paul Sartre sight gags arent a joke). Gondry has such an incomparable understanding of the way in which strange and unexpected sights can tickle you. What he sometimes lacks as a filmmaker is the awareness that he can tickle an audience to death. Magic in the Moonlight directed by Woody Allen Its possible Allen has solved the Emma Stone problem. It was pretty simple Hire her. Here shes Sophie Baker an American psychic residing among rich Yankees in late-1920s southern France. Is she a four-star clairvoyant or a two-bit gold digger? Who better to crack the case than the esteemed if conceited Orientalist stage magician Stanley Crawford (Colin Firth)? What happens here needs no clairvoyance. Firth is not as 25 as Stone is so theyre a match. But the movies opening hour has a fascinating balance of nonsense and depth. The buttery haze of Darius Khondjis photography goes nicely with Allens attempt to conflate Nietzsches human distrust and F. Scott Fitzgeralds class ladders with poetic writing. The more Sophie appears to be the real deal the deeper into spiritual doubt Stanleys arrogance sinks. If only Allen could keep that introspection and frippery going. Eileen Atkins Jacki Weaver Marcia Gay Harden and an elegantly spent Simon McBurney do fine work. And Stone doesnt overdo anything -- shes daffy and cunning. You dont know whether shes running a con. Actually yes you do. You just dont care. But the movie runs out of ideas for her character. Sophie and Stanley appear to be in a belief-oriented arm-wrestling match that you want her to win. But her character gets dumber and dumber the further from her gift she gets. If Allen thinks he has transferred that magic to the embarrassing last scene then he should be the object of Stanleys next debunking. The Giver directed by Phillip Noyce One risk of these dystopia series is that they start to run together. Lois Lowrys Giver novels the first of which showed up in 1993 are a recent forerunner of series like The Hunger Games and the delusionally self-defensively titled Divergent. But this adaptation arrives after those and sleepwalks in their shadow. Its hard to care that its special-chosen-gifted nonconformist hero Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) wants to restore painful memories to a utopia from which such truths have been erased. Thwaites and the kids playing his fellow classmates are like live-action Kohls catalogue models. Meryl Streep does some half-chilling insinuation as the head elder. Jeff Bridges in the venerated title role mumbles through another part. (Hes like a car radiator that needs water.) And the brief appearance of Taylor Swift is like an answer to clues in a game of charades blonde? Hallucinated? Plasmatic? Piano? The films been shot in dreary black-and-white. The primary mode of communication is ritualized passive-aggressiveness (""Thank you for childhood"" young graduates are told; and the mantra ""We accept your apology"" comes to sound like ""Up yours""). And the color montages of those erased memories feature all the brown people who arent actually part of the narrative. This might be an anti-pharmaceutical anti-cult (Katie Holmes aptly drones along as Jonass mom) anti-plot anti-suspense allegory. It could also just be Thanksgiving at your robot-zombie in-laws. Into the Storm directed by Steven Quale Ill say this for humanity. Its still strong enough that when this lazily conceived lousily acted painfully dumb movie gives you the option to root either for the computer-generated tornadoes or for the people exploiting them for fame and cash Ill still choose the people. But its not an easy choice. What weve got here is somewhere between Twister and one of those storm-chaser reality shows except Jan de Bont made Twister. That man knew how to make a comic-suspenseful set piece -- and Helen Hunt Bill Paxton and Philip Seymour Hoffman knew how to act. This movie uses that found-footage device in which none of the characters can ever put the camera down especially when running for his life. Even the brand-new Oklahoma high school lovebirds keep theirs running while the building theyre trapped in turns them into the kids from Titanic. Occasionally the gimmick vanishes and you have to wonder whos doing the camerawork and who has supplied the pseudo military-video-game home-screen music. Youre asked to wonder a lot actually. Why is saving the day the job of the vice-principal (Richard Armitage) and not the Obama-eared Updike-quoting hardheaded principal-principal? (No answer required.) And is the movie really gonna start a thing between the vice-principal and the guilty single-mother meteorologist (Sarah Wayne Callies)? Oh my god it is (Its preposterous to have Armitage wear his suit this wet and this tight if he wont rip it off and start catching falling barns.) The one beautiful image is of Veeps Matt Walsh defanged of comedy and his armored vehicle as its sucked into the eye of the storm. Then you remember theres only one direction left for him to go in and that even though hes playing the biggest asshole and most selfish moron its the wrong one. But barely. The Dog directed by Allison Berg and Frank Keraudren Theres a brashness to this documentary that sneaks up on you. In recounting the life of John Wojtowicz the Brooklyn guy whose all-day all-night 1972 bank robbery was the basis for Sidney Lumets Dog Day Afternoon the film gets personalities of a New York vintage that have gone out of style. Wojtowicz who died in 2006 is as they say a character. But so are the woman and men he married. So is his mother. Old and flabby and gray when the filmmakers find him he loves their attention. And they indulge him letting him surf jovial tirades about how he was a ""chauvinistic pig"" and ""the boss"" and a real ""motherfucker"" and the ""gay Babe Ruth."" But the movie always has its eye on a bigger story of sex and sexuality never losing the thread of Wojtowiczs megalomania narcissism and libidinousness. The robbery was for money to fund a sex reassignment surgery for Wojtowiczs wife Elizabeth Eden. But the marriage seemed doomed during the wedding when Wojtowicz tried to make out with everyone in sight. Berg and Keraudren have done reporting and research. Theyve found archival video and audio footage as good as Lumets film and in some instances far more illuminating. They tell the story of mental illness sexual politics homophobia and personal profit. Even with the social legal and political advances of the past 40 or so years what blew minds about and drew crowds to Wojtowiczs particularly yet peculiarly American story in the 1970s only seems slightly less bizarre now. A Will for the Woods directed by Amy Browne Tony Hale Jeremy Kaplan and Brian Wilson Another documentary that ends with a plea to visit a website -- in this case to find out more about so-called green burial. You roll your eyes only because the movie itself opens into an eloquent enough sales pitch on behalf of its primary human subject Clark Wang. Wang is a North Carolina musician and psychiatrist who has terminal cancer. Upon his death hed like to be buried au naturel -- no preservatives no fancy coffin. A wood box in the dirt will do. The movie feels entirely promotional provoking separate unanswered questions about green medicine too. Natural burials supporters want a normal process of decay in which the body enters the earth chemical-free. But Wang fights for his life and that requires lots of machines and treatments and cross-country driving. Im sure theres a rationale the natural-burial people could articulate but the filmmakers arent journalists enough to ask. They do have a sense of serenity and in Wang a persuasive movingly all-too-human case for the cause. Why bother with a URL when youve got this? Jealousy directed by Philippe Garrel Theres only one way to run in Garrels movies passionately. I mean that physically -- at some point Anna Mouglalis abruptly bursts out of a cafe and barrels down the street. Who at first can say why? Its an instinct. But the running is true emotionally too. The characters in Garrels umpteenth romantic drama run passionately but theyre cool. Mouglalis plays an actress who hasnt worked in years. She does odd jobs when she does anything at all. Her relationship with another actor (Garrels son Louis) seems to satisfy and exasperate her at the same time. But despite a dalliance with a cast mate he finds the idea of life without her impossible. The films 77 minutes shot in an autumnal woolly Bergmanesque black-and-white watch them do nothing much -- alone together or her with friends or him with his young daughter and other actors. Theres a casualness at work here thats absorbing because Garrel doesnt make a moment mean more than it ought to. So much of being in a relationship is spent in idleness on standby being slumped over the other person ostensibly doing nothing but being bound. For Garrels character that bond is sustenance (few actors are as all in as Garrell can be). For Mouglaliss the bond is something to toy with. Hers is the voice of a woman whose first words were ""Do you have a light?"" Here Mouglalis moves so casually from blase to neurotic that you question her employment status. She hasnt worked in so long because she has turned love into theater. Dinosaur 13 directed by Todd Douglas Miller In 1990 a group of American paleontologists discovered Sue the most complete T. rex fossil ever. They just happened to do so on land whose ownership was in dispute. This documentary works hard to be a custody drama among the scientists the federal government and an old South Dakota rancher with a complicated legal claim to what turns out to be Sioux land. It gets most of the way there. The story itself is so strange and the case so baffling. Theres no filmmaking to speak of just a collection of talking heads not enough of which belong to the government or the rancher. The storytelling raises more logistical and legal questions than its equipped to answer. But what Miller does have for anyone unfamiliar with Sues fate is a story with a suspenseful climax and at the very least a determination to tell it decently enough to leave the audience happy for the dinosaur and sad for the men and women who dug her up. Frank directed by Lenny Abrahamson Magnolia Pictures The reason rock dramas are usually so bad is that they dont know where in the band to find the story. Is it with the musicians the creation of the songs their performance? Very few movies supply the answer. Instead they give you poses and tics. This tedious movie does that as well. Domhnall Gleason winds up in a band with Maggie Gyllenhaal Scoot McNairy and Michael Fassbender who as Frank spends the movie in a disproportionally large papier-mache head presenting an aggravating affront to the sport of losing oneself in Fassbenders face. Its based on the story of the comic and musician Chris Sievey who spent some of his career in a similar head as Frank Sidebottom. Things go from cutesy to clever to grim from the bands country shack to the road and it takes too long to get everywhere. The songs meanwhile are knowing nonsense but they dont point to any larger idea about nonsense songs making you wonder if the band really knows. Theyre what in Infinite Jest would be called apres-garde. And it doesnt feel good to watch actors this good look this lost. All the irritation in Gyllenhaals performance and the boyish bafflement in McNairys appear to arise from the possibility that none of the actors -- except Fassbender who by the films insultingly cheap last act is in a totally different movie -- knows what theyre doing. Its as if the director is made of papier-mache too.

Theyre just not sufficiently scary unless a) there are also sharks involved or b) there are loads of them. Wisely (if hardly scientifically) this shakycam screamer adopts the latter approach - and when the badass cyclones do muscle into town ripping up schools banks and airports willy-nilly the film is fairly fun to watch. Sadly everything else about it is well a bit of a disaster. The characters - including Richard Thorin Oakenshield Armitage as a smalltown dad who cant relate to his kids and Sarah Wayne Callies as a weather scientist - are without exception derivative and dull. The film plays fast and loose with its found-footage structure and thanks to some epic windspeeds these cams are even more sickeningly shaky than usual. The result is diverting but hardly worth getting in a twist over.

"Into the Storm | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; into-the-storm ) Into the Storm (United States 2014) August 08 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli Into the Storm is as straightforward a disaster film as youre likely to find. It has all the characteristics of the genre. The narrative trajectory is linear and uncomplicated. The two-dimensional characters are entrenched in their own flimsy soap opera-ish storylines. The acting varies from over-the-top to wooden. Human suffering although given lip service isnt high on the filmmakers priority list. Most importantly however the destruction and carnage is presented with verve and flair making this a fine example of tornado porn. The twisters in this film dont take people over the rainbow. They smash shred and do other nasty things to them. Despite these characteristics or perhaps because of them Into the Storm is an entertaining motion picture although the way it enthralls puts it close to the ""guilty pleasure"" category. There are three keys to the movies success. By combining traditional filmmaking techniques and ""found footage"" clips director Steve Quale is able to generate a sense of urgency. He also understands how to build momentum leading up to a big moment. There are no annoying and unnecessary villains in the film - this allows the weather to take its rightful place as the antagonist. Finally the various backstories and subplots of the wafer-thin characters are limited in scope and duration. This allows the movie to clock in at a lean 89 minutes. The lack of bloat - a common trait of too many disaster films - makes Into the Storm refreshing. It moves quickly is never boring and offers some cool tornado shots that look like the real thing. This is not Twister 2. The only elements common to Into the Storm and the 1996 Jan de Bont thriller are that they both depict computer generated storms and employ speaker rattling sound that delivers an auditory punch. Into the Storm has no scenery-chewing Cary Elwes no half-baked romance between the leads and (most notably) no flying cows. Yet Into the Storm is fun for the reason Twister is fun - because it puts viewers into harrowing situations without subjecting their bodies to danger. The film follows two groups of characters. The first is a team of storm chasers led by documentary filmmaker Pete (Matt Walsh) and meteorologist Allison (Sarah Wayne Callies). They have come to hurricane alley in search of Petes ""money shot"" - footage from within the eye of the tornado. Meanwhile local high school assistant principal Gary (Richard Armitage looking nothing like Thorin Oakenshield) is debating whether to cancel graduation due to bad weather reports. He suggests the possibility to the principal who rejects the idea out-of-hand. This decision will have ramifications for Garys two sons Donnie (Max Deacon) and Trey (Nathan Kress) and Donnies long-time crush Kaitlyn (Alycia Debnam Carey). The storm chasers and some of the situations in which they find themselves are based on the real-life individuals who populated the late Discovery Channel series Storm Chasers. Pete is a thinly-veiled version of documentarian Sean Casey and Petes armor-plated vehicle resembles Caseys storm-proof TIV. Many of Caseys traits can be found in Pete a prickly personality an obsessive desire to ""get the shot"" and an underlying respect for the power of storms. Because of that Pete is Into the Storms only interesting character. Everyone else is a type and in some cases a poorly defined type. The tornados have more personality than some of the secondary individuals. The special effects are solid in their representations of storms even if there arent any cows. This being a Hollywood production ""normal"" tornados despite their ability to visit devastation upon populated areas arent flashy enough. So theres a scene in which four of five tornados drop down at once a twister that sucks up flaming fuel and turns into an inferno and a monster EF5. I suspect meteorologists might not be pleased with Into the Storms sensationalism but for a layperson it shouldnt be hard to suspend disbelief. The post-storm devastation looks all-too-real and dampens the fun a little. The movie is fiction but some of those scenes have documentary qualities. Into the Storms marketing campaign makes the movie seem overwrought loud melodramatic and cheesy. In a sense its all of those things but the proportions are better in the feature than in the trailers. And none of those things matter in the face of the majesty of the tornados which are rendered with a frightening realism. In the end Into the Storm doesnt aspire to be more than what it is a well-constructed disaster film.

They whip gargantuan structures about as if multi-ton objects were toys. Director Steven Quale paints tornadoes as mindless monsters in his latest project "" Into the Storm"" a visually stunning disaster-thriller that ultimately feels cheap with its perverse take on death and gratitude. ""Storm"" opens with a prologue of sorts A car full of teens waiting like sitting ducks in the dead of night is pulverized by an invisible twister. But not before one of the kids jumps out to capture the mayhem on his cellphone. The news reports follow the opening credits. A catastrophic storm system is heading toward the fictionalized town of Silverton (too close for comfort maybe) in Tornado Alley. Screenwriter John Swetnam has trifurcated the movies narrative storm chasers daredevils and a high school community each experience the tornadoes in their own ways. At the helm of the pro storm chasers is Pete (Matt Walsh) whose lifelong dream has been to capture footage of the eye of a storm ""a sight only God has seen."" Hes joined by a meteorologist (Sarah Wayne Callies) as well as a slew of professional videographers (including Arlen Escarpeta and Jeremy Sumpter) who are crafting a documentary. The documentary angle is a sleek quirk. Petes videographers wield cameras like professionals thus giving the film a first-person perspective that trumps the stale shakiness of todays found-footage films but still gives ""Storm"" an immersive edge. Every thread of the story has its own sub-element. Walshs Pete is a career-obsessed jerk who cares more about storms than his people. Callies and Richard Armitage take turns as single parents struggling to connect with their kids. Armitages two onscreen offspring Donnie (Max Deacon) and Trey (Nathan Kress) are not bad. But unfortunately for Deacon the Donnie character is sculpted as a spineless Disney Channel wimp. Trey offers refreshing comic relief. Theres a lot to chew on here. Consequently the script is packed so tight theres not much room for meaningful fleshed-out character development. (Enough room for cheesy thriller-recycled dialogue though.) Many of the characters their bite-sized moments of drama and their arcs disappear into the background of the film playing second fiddle to the real star the tornado(es). Fans of the ""Final Destination"" series will delight in ""Storms"" disaster-porn tendencies. Beautifully constructed jaw-dropping twisters ruin a school and its graduation; tear through homes fields and used-car lots; and toss trees and semis around like broccoli and Hot Wheels. All this gorgeous hypnotic doom on the big screen leads to death and destruction which is presented as a cool exhilarating ride. When a storm-chaser is swallowed by a flaming tornado his comrades feign grief. Hes forgotten in seconds. The ""Storm"" continues as a shameless tone-deaf unrelenting string of disasters. Then at films close theres a laughable shallow beyond-cheesy moral about being alive. The movie feels like it has its requisite parts. But something doesnt mesh. Theres a great cast but most of the acting comes off as caricatured and one-note. The plot is well paced -- the film clocks in just under 90 minutes -- but every scene without a tornado feels anticlimactic. There are human elements but theyre never fully explored. If you want an awesome surround-sound massive screen experience of an EF5 tornado from the inside-out pony up for a ticket.

"Into the Storm spins too-familiar yarn but the effects are good Review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesInto the Storm spins too-familiar yarn but the effects are good Review Into the Storm features some very impressive special effects tornado action. But the plot is pedestrian though buoyed by some nice performances.Stern father Gary (Richard Armitrage) is much relieved his sons Donnie (Max Deacon) and Trey (Nathan Kress) made it through in Into the Storm.  (MCT)  By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentFri. Aug. 8 2014Into the StormStarring Sarah Wayne Callies Richard Armitage. Directed by Steven Quale. 89 minutes. Now playing. PGReady for a new spin on storm-chasers?If weak plotting isnt a big concern then Into the Storm may be right up your tornado alley.Article Continued BelowDespite a relatively compact running time the film feels like a windy affair involving a team of desperate twister chasers and a high school full of teens in peril including a stern assistant principal and his two sons.But the special effects are quite impressive and diverting preventing the film from being so much hot air.Sarah Wayne Callies of Walking Dead fame plays meteorological wonder woman Allison. Her petulant boss Pete (Matt Walsh) demands that she use her fancy gizmos to come up with a big blow for his team to video and fast. Allison pins her hopes on little Silverton Oklahoma to keep her job and the wind gods are more than happy to oblige with a multi-funnelled extravaganza.Meanwhile stern widower dad Gary (Richard Armitage) is too distracted to realize hes treating sons Donnie (Max Deacon) and Trey (Nathan Kress star of Nickelodeons iCarly) too gruffly.Script writer John Swetnam employs the increasingly hackneyed ""found footage"" concept -- just about everyone in the film fortuitously has a camera on hand as the wind blows -- while resorting to another tired trope pointlessly giving captions to even the most minor of players in the film.But the films biggest misstep -- again courtesy of Swetnam -- is the introduction of two hayseed characters Donk (Kyle Davis) and Reevis (Jon Reep) who happily and drunkenly revel outside as the storm sends everyone else screaming and running for cover. If these two guys were meant to be comic relief they fail utterly in the task.The film is bound to be compared Twister the 1996 film about two rival storm-chasing gangs that is much better plotted. But Into the Storm is far superior in one sense the special effects and their evocation of the raw and destructive power of nature.The cast of Into the Storm is actually pretty solid and appealing particularly Deacon and Kress as the two brothers and Callies as the plucky tornado expert.But despite the plethora of impressive visuals Into the Storm comes close to being -- with apologies to Shakespeares Macbeth -- a tale full of sound and fury signifying nothing.Read more about MeteorologyThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

The first is the summertime yen for righteous kablooey the dumber the better exemplified here by drunk galoots hauling ass into a twister on a four-wheeler ATV tossing beer cans and whooping about getting a ""million YouTube hits."" Another character actually calls them ""idjits"" because Hollywood assumes 2014 flyover country takes vocab cues from Yosemite Sam. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Not that theres much flying over happening here In the climactic mega-funnel jets and eighteen wheelers flit about like dollar bills in one of those county-fair grab-the-money booths. Thats one of several audaciously dumb bits Just moments after seeing four twisters touch down including one on fire and destroy the movies Everytown Main Street a teenage boy glances at meteorological equipment hes never seen before and cries out ""Its getting worse"" Genuinely impressive is an image of scream-along poetry a trip up and through the top of a tornado where we get to hang in the calm sunshine for a couple breaths before being sucked back in. Seriously two different guys at the screening I caught shouted ""Oh shit"" at the same time.So the flicks got blockbuster bona fides and an of-the-moment found-footage aesthetic although director Quale abandons it for long stretches. Too bad all that razzle-dazzle keeps smashing into that second front our real-world memories of Joplin Greensburg and those three days in 2011 when tornadoes killed 348 Americans. Have we ever before seen such big-ticket escapist entertainment about the awesomeness of something that so recently killed so many of us? Doesnt it usually take longer before everyones eager for candy spun from trauma? Film Details Into the Storm RatingPG-13 GenreSuspense/Thriller Running Time89 More Info Trailer The CGI effects are too goofy to take seriously but the devastated homes and streets look like devastated homes and streets and the post-climax scenes of tattered American flags and survivors coming together to heal could be well-shot news footage -- save for the glaringly false way two of the male leads are now paired up with happenin ladies they connected with during their tornado adventures. The character beats -- and there are a lot of them -- are hokily old-fashioned more evidence of the filmmakers irreconcilable impulses. At the end instead of looking horrified as they lurk around in the ruins of everything they have ever loved these harried survivors are all immediately beaming with the certainty that theyve each learned a lesson about what lifes really about. Too cartoonish to be cathartic and too ghoulish to be honest fun Into the Storm is mostly a somewhat uncomfortable sit enlivened by occasional hilariousness like when it implies that the obsessive storm chaser played by Matt Walsh (hilarious as Mike on Veep) might be in cahoots with the tornadoes. Biggest disappointment The lack of a Marvel-style post-credits stinger revealing that the villain next time is hail.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr INTO THE STORM Sarah Wayne Callies D+ Into the Storm Genre Thriller; Starring Richard Armitage Sarah Wayne Callies Nathan Kress Jeremy Sumpter; Director Steven Quale; Release Date Wide 08/08/2014; Runtime (in minutes) 89; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted August 13 2014 -- 1200 AM EDT I never thought Id call Jan de Bonts tornado flick Twister a classic. But compared to the straight-faced schlock epic currently blowing into theaters Into the Storm its a masterpiece of refinement and subtlety. Hell its almost an art film. Back in the summer of 1996 de Bont paid cheeky homage to the disaster movies of the 70s (with a wink to The Wizard of Oz) by assaulting the audience with the furious wrath of Mother Nature including the surreal sight of an airborne cow floating past his camera mid-moo. Now nearly two decades later in Steven Quales limp and smudgy Xerox of a Xerox the director throws everything he can muster at the camera (zapping power lines tin-can schoolbuses barns seemingly made of tissue paper) while simultaneously tossing all logic out the window. Its the kind of movie the Weather Channel would make if all of its producers were taken hostage by brain-dead 12-year-old boys. The hook this time around is that the Storm of the Century is captured found-footage-style (a creaky narrative crutch that really needs to be abolished). While de Bont at least knew enough to open his checkbook and hire the services of real actors (Helen Hunt Bill Paxton Philip Seymour Hoffman) to complement his orgy of destruction with flesh-and-blood characters Quale is stuck with a cast that looks like theyd rather be huddled underground in a shelter with some peanut butter and a stack of National Geographic magazines until the all-clear siren sounds. Among the soggy cardboard characters are a high school vice principal father (Richard Armitage) and his two teenage sons (Max Deacon and Nathan Kress) a pair of dumb-and-dumber redneck jackasses (Kyle Davis and Jon Reep) trying to parlay their brush with death into YouTube fame and a team of intrepid storm-chasing filmmakers headed up by The Walking Deads Sarah Wayne Callies and Veeps Matt Walsh (in a role so cartoonishly villainous hed literally be twirling his mustache if he had one). As the Big One -- or more accurately a pair of Big Ones -- heads straight for the small Tornado Belt town of Silverton the various barely-sketched parties all find themselves in the swirling 300-mile-per-hour crosshairs with a laundry list of personal issues they each have to work out before theyre turned into meteorological mincemeat. While Quale who directed Final Destination 5 after cutting his teeth working second-unit for James Cameron on Titanic and Avatar manages to summon some truly special special f/x (a deluge of baseball-sized hail a whirlwind vortex of fire) his screenwriter (John Sweetnam) makes a hash of all of the snoozy interpersonal moments between gee-whiz money shots. Dont get me wrong Im as willing to check my brain at the door and submit to an idiotic late-summer spectacle as the next person. But this funnel-cloud fiasco tries to suck up everything in its path and just winds up sucking.

JOHN SEMLEY Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Aug. 08 2014 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Aug. 08 2014 849AM EDT Comments AA Directed by Stephen Quale Written by John Swetnam Starring Richard Armitage Sarah Wayne Callias Matt Walsh Classification PG Country USA Language English What we are dealing with"" Richard Dreyfusss dorky Hooper tells the arrogant Mayor Vaughn in Jaws ""is a perfect engine an eating machine."" If Jaws is the perfect revenge-of-nature film its precisely because the man-eating shark is just that an engine. It kills it eats it reproduces. It doesnt care that the local police chief is afraid of water. Its not bothered by some ornery sea captains vendetta against it. It is totally ambivalent to the world its destroying. And thats terrifying. Into The Storm throws down an even more perfect mechanism of destruction a tornado. Or rather a series of tornadoes. Or ...well ... its more like a bunch of tornadoes (one of which catches fire at one point) that wind through each others paths until they form an enormous supertornado whipping across the full length of the movie screen a monstrous turbine of totally unfeeling mayhem.Except maybe its not dispassionate. Maybe its more than just an engine chugging along. In an epoch of films with names like Heaven Is For Real and TV programs like HBOs The Leftovers (a post-Rapture soap that seems to posit the existence of God as an actual fact) is it so weird that a scrappy summer blockbuster - budgeted at 50-million (U.S.) peanuts by Marvel Studios standards - functions as a barely veiled Christian allegory?After all this is a film where characters talk about their faith binding them together; where an empty church provides sanctuary for hardscrabble storm chasers; where the reluctant hero (funnyman Matt Walsh) redeems himself and is literally carried into the clouds where he bears witness to a blinding white light that might as well be the Lords good grace.Theres plenty of redemption and salvation here as the citizens of a small Midwestern town duck and cover for 90 minutes as the supertwister rips through the main streets and middle schools of a picturesque practically Rockwellian America. But Into The Storm is more attuned to the Old Testament stuff fire and brimstone Biblical plagues trial and tribulations of the human spirit ripped straight out of the Book of Job. In the eye of the storm is The Hobbits Richard Armitage as a brawny high-school vice principal and single dad shouldered with saving his two sons while keeping an entire town safely huddled in the school building. Theres also a team of documentarians headquartered in a roving tank called the Titus. In keeping with the films reverence-for-nature theme the vehicle shares its name with the Roman commander who led the siege of Jerusalem. Its as if chasing a tornado is not just foolhardy but an actual affront to God. And buddy you should see how God can hit back when He whips a whole bunch of air around.The film is assembled as is boringly de rigueur (especially for cheap movies looking to hide their cheapness) in found-footage style with characters constantly filming everything around them even when doing so may be totally stupid and dangerous. More often than not the style opens itself to all kinds of nagging questions. Who is collecting and assembling this footage? Who is licensing Aerosmith songs for the soundtrack? Why is the video quality of a late-model iPhone consistent with that of a professional-grade digital camera?Into The Storm makes overtures at answering these questions with characters reminding each other that the footage can save lives. It serves a higher purpose - the highest purpose even. The film elevates its revenge of nature environmentalism into a ham-handed Edenic parable its characters wrung through a ringer of righteous suffering in order that they be reminded that they are stewards of the Earth and each other. To paraphrase a conversation early in the film we take care of nature or nature takes care of us.Its all very very silly - not to mention off-puttingly earnest. But its a good deal more entertaining than Sunday school.

"Review Into the Storm is a howling visual-effects success - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Into the Storm is a howling visual-effects success Into the Storm review Warner Bros. The tornadoes are the stars of the special-effects-heavy ""Into the Storm."" The tornadoes are the stars of the special-effects-heavy ""Into the Storm."" (Warner Bros.) Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter The story line and performances in Into the Storm are OK but those terrible twisters are state of the art It starts with the distant sound of thunder. But those tempests wont stay distant for long oh no. This film isnt called ""Into the Storm"" for nothing.Basically a B picture with a sizable effects budget ""Into the Storm"" knows you bought your ticket for the tornadoes not the dramatics and acts accordingly. Its story line and performances are no more than serviceable but those terrible twisters are state of the art. Hollywood has tackled nasty weather systems before most notably in 1996s ""Twister"" directed by Jan de Bont starring Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton and featuring Philip Seymour Hoffman in one of his more obscure supporting roles as storm chaser Dustin ""Dusty"" Davis.Special-effects technology has advanced considerably in the intervening years and as orchestrated by visual effects producer Randall Starr ""Storm"" features an entire smorgasbord of effects which Starr is happy to delineate in the press notes ""traditional wedge tornadoes slender rope tornadoes a fire tornado and a massive two-mile-wide tornado."" Whew. Though those intense unnerving storm systems have no trouble holding our attention the same cannot be said for the rest of the film which does have a promising premise but lacks the wherewithal to make the most of it. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a half-hearted shell game Mark Olsen The new adaptation of the comic book ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" directed by Jonathan Liebesman often feels like some sort of corporate seminar in brand management. There is something half-hearted about the entire film as if those behind it were involved not because they wanted to make it... The new adaptation of the comic book ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" directed by Jonathan Liebesman often feels like some sort of corporate seminar in brand management. There is something half-hearted about the entire film as if those behind it were involved not because they wanted to make it... (Mark Olsen) As written by John Swetnam and directed by Steven Quale (whose last film was the horror item ""Final Destination 5"") ""Storm"" was conceived as a point-of-view film. Everything we see is footage shot by one of the characters which has the effect of putting the audience behind the camera.The ""Storm"" cast is capable if little known. (The biggest name is Richard Armitage who plays exiled dwarf king Thorin Oakenshield in the ""Hobbit"" films.) But none of them has anything particularly new or involving to do with themselves until those winds start howling. Read more movie reviews gt;gt;Open link Met first is a team of professional storm chasers who have been rattling around the country for months in the Titus a tank-like vehicle specially built down to its bulletproof Lexan windows and 4 millimeters of steel armor plating to withstand the toughest of tornadoes. Or so Pete Moore (Matt Walsh) thinks. A dyspeptic documentary filmmaker Moore is after ""a sight nobody but God has witnessed the eye of the tornado."" So he is more than a little miffed that the teams resident meteorologist Allison Stone (Sarah Wayne Callies) has been unsuccessful in guiding the crew to places where tornadoes are about to touch down. Her luck however is about to change.Stone suggests a tiny town called Silverton Okla. and though Moore grumbles we know shes right this time. The film has already introduced us to a few of Silvertons citizens and that wouldnt have happened if a storm wasnt headed in their direction.Sixteen-year-old high school junior Donnie Morris (Max Deacon) head of the video club has the standard issue array of teen problems. His younger brother Trey (Nathan Kress) is obnoxious his father Gary (Armitage) the schools vice principal is always on his case and Kaitlyn (Alycia Debnam-Carey) the girl he has a crush on barely knows hes alive. Can you imagine.Silverton is also the home to the films nominal comic relief a pair of moronic amateur thrill seekers named Donk (Kyle Davis) and Reevis (Jon Reep) who will try anything in the hope of getting footage that will go viral on YouTube and make them famous.Once the storm chasers arrive in Silverton and all that bad weather makes itself known ""Into the Storm"" kicks into a more effective gear. Its no spoiler to reveal that these tornadoes just happen to be the biggest storms that ever were and watching them chew up buildings like they were so many corn bread muffins cant help but be involving.Praise also goes to production designer David R. Sandefur who among other things saw to it that the sight of the chaotic wreckage those tornadoes left behind them is as unnerving as the twisters themselves. ""I waited my whole life for a storm like this"" top chaser Moore says and ""Into the Storm"" shows us that that wait has not been in vain.kenneth.turanlatimes.comTwitter KennethTuran------------Into the Storm MPAA rating PG-13 for scenes of intense destruction and peril language sexual referencesRunning time 1 hour 29 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Reviews Entertainment Column Tornadoes and Wind Storms Bill Paxton Philip Seymour Hoffman The Hundred-Foot Journey follows its recipe to the letter Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad81deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-into-the-storm-review-20140808-column.html,200,intothestorm13,intothestorm,latimes

PHOTOS WARNER BROS. PICTURES Storm chasers try to get as close as they can to tornadoes pummeling Oklahoma in ""Into the Storm.""PHOTOS WARNER BROS. PICTURES BY MICHAEL SRAGOW / MOVIE CRITIC Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF Into the StormStarring Richard Armitage Directed by Steven Quale Rated PG-13 for sequences of intense destruction and peril and language including some sexual references Running time 1 hour 31 minutes Playing In wide releaseThe quick hitNo amount of sound and special effects can plug all the holes in this tornado disaster movie. Grade D ""Into the Storm"" has all the visual elan of pop spurting from a shaken soda can. After 25 minutes of turgid setups for characters youll never care about director Steven Quale pulls the tab on his tornadoes and they tear across the Oklahoma landscape. They move as crazily and incomprehensibly as giant alien tendrils composed of clouds and debris. Considering their mass power and velocity their cinematic impact is pathetic. Quale and his screenwriter John Swetnam bungle their chance to reignite the chills and spills of big-screen disaster films. Nothing holds their movie together They sacrifice minimum logic for striking shots supposedly taken by storm chasers cameras and amateurs devices. How long can witnesses face an advancing land spout before they ought to cut and run? Here most of them keep shooting until the few saner people pull them away. (Youre amazed that the major actors suffer so few casualties.) The audience never learns why some characters get knocked around at 100 yards while others dont get hurt unless a funnel literally picks them up by the seat of their pants. Without telling us why as well as why we should care the movie contains no suspense only momentary shocks cued by amped-up whooshing sounds that blow your eardrums not your mind. This must be the only disaster movie in which presumably intelligent characters - a high school vice principal (Richard Armitage) and his two sons the older sons crush and a professional tornado chaser and his team including a meteorologist single mother - decide to hide from a storm in a storm drain. Among many non sequiturs The movie is set in a fictional small town but it has an airport stocked with 747s so we can see them crashing through the air like a wind-tossed mobile near the open window in a nursery. By far the most intriguing character is a tank built to withstand tornadoes. It brings a bit of ""Mad Max"" to a sappy heartland saga meant to instill reverence for peaceful everyday miracles. Some of us would settle for a good movie. In a rare witty touch near the beginning the high school principal (Scott Lawrence) reads his graduating seniors this quote from John Updike ""You cannot help but learn more as you take the world into your hands. Take it up reverently for it is an old piece of clay with millions of thumbprints on it."" ""Into the Storm"" demolishes the earth and its all thumbs.

Credit Warner Bros. Pictures INTO THE STORMOpens on FridayDirected by Steven Quale1 hour 30 minutesA series of tornadoes and laughably poor evacuation decisions batter a town in Steven Quales ""Into the Storm"" which regales us with voluptuous images of devastation.Per disaster movie tradition people trade banter jargon and heart-to-hearts a crew of storm chasers a vice principal and his two sons and other walking targets. But the tornadoes are the stars and the giveaway is the filmmakers pedigree Mr. Quale and company have logged time in the ""Final Destination"" franchise amassing macabre expertise in orchestrating destruction.This film is actually less menacing than marveling though a disturbing opening scene in a storm-tossed van could fit right into Mr. Quales earlier work. The filmmakers proudly roll out smoothly animated panoramas of tornadoes snaking down from the sky or billowing into an end-of-days fireball (and driving survivors into a church). Trucks plummet like giant hailstones. The scenes of shelter resemble those moments in airplane dramas in which the cabin is howlingly breached. (The sound design is wizardly.)First-person camerawork is the movies wearyingly requisite ""update"" for our times necessitating insipid excuses for why we see what were seeing. And the notion that we should worry about human beings -- even poor Matt Walsh heroically staying deadpan as lead storm chaser -- becomes a source of humor in what is otherwise a showcase for extreme weather.A different breed from ""Twister"" (1996) ""Into the Storm"" raises a question with its finest shots Would the painter J. M. W. Turner just make disaster movies today?""Into the Storm"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for the full wrath of God and computer animation mavens and some adolescent banter.

Its the stuff thats so bad its good deadly serious hopelessly square humorless oblivious. Real camp like ""Reefer Madness"" or ""Xanadu"" barely exists anymore. When Hollywood began making it on purpose -- ""Snakes on a Plane"" for instance -- the game was up. These days even genuinely bad movies dont seem that funny anymore. But wait ""Into the Storm"" a disaster flick from Steven Quale doesnt know any of that. This movie must have been underground when ""Sharknado"" dropped and made a laughingstock of its entire genre. But ""Into the Storm"" strides into multiplexes today as if its closest competition were 1974s ""Earthquake."" Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Set up as a compendium of first-person videos (but with a brow-knitting score by Brian Taylor) ""Into the Storm"" is set in Silverton a geographically vague town full of cardboard people. We meet high school vice principal Gary Fuller (Richard Armitage) and his two sons (Max Deacon Nathan Kress) plus their pretty classmate Kaitlyn (Alycia Debnam-Carey). Rumbling into town in the tanklike Titus vehicle are mercenary storm-chaser Pete Moore (Matt Walsh) and softhearted meteorologist Allison Stone (Sarah Wayne Callies). Donk and Reevis the local ""Jackass"" types are played too convincingly by Kyle Davis and John Reep. Why is Silverton being pummeled by freak tornadoes? ""What used to be a once-in-a-lifetime storm now happens about once a year"" says Allison though even climate change defenders might snort when she somberly warns that Los Angeles is next. Right about here ""Into the Storm"" goes from merely lousy to wildly bad. The laws of physics are chucked to the wind. One twister becomes a flaming column -- a hellnado -- while others lift passenger jets off the tarmac. None however can catch a speeding school bus trip up a running father or loosen the grip of a high-school boy. MoviesSummer movies with big anniversaries in 2014 ""Into the Storm"" maintains a straight face through every ludicrous minute. No spoilers but theres only one way this movie can end With tributes to the fallen and a fluttering American flag. advertisement | advertise on newsday PLOT The good folks of Silverton try to survive a multiple tornado onslaught.

Watch a clip from the film ""Into the Storm"" starring Richard Armitage Sarah Wayne Callies and Matt Walsh. Photo/Video Warner Bros. By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Aug. 7 2014 237 p.m. ET 0 COMMENTS When ""Twister"" opened in 1996 I called it ""the loudest thing youre liable to hear without sticking your head inside a jet engine."" Given the evolution of sound systems since then its not surprising that ""Into the Storm"" is much louder. Whats remarkable about this long-belated and low-rent knockoff however is the velocity of its cheerful idiocy the blithe vacuity of its narrative downtime between tornado touchdowns. More Reviews The Hundred-Foot Journey Deepsea Challenge 3D What If The main storm-chaser a dislikable crackpot named Pete ( Matt Walsh) courts disaster that he clearly deserves though he does have an amusing epiphany. The vice principal of the local high school Gary (Richard Armitage) fails to cancel outdoor graduation ceremonies in the face of ominous weather forecasts though he succeeds at becoming a hero in the teeth of multiple storms. Sometimes the intentional silliness pays off sometimes it falls flat. Still the proof of this pudding is in the whooshing and the digital effects--the animation really--may well make the movie a hit. Everything gets sucked up into the vortex (even a fleet of 747s that unaccountably appear at the local airport) and every vortex is followed by a bigger one until Mother Nature finally remembers where she put sunshine and blue sky. To give the film its full due the people who made it--the writer John Swetnam and the director Steven Quale--got wind of a genuine trend and ran with it. Everyone on screen is busy filming everyone else. Its a shakier-camera version of ""The Blair Witch Project"" in the era of YouTube.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Stephanie Merry August 7 2014 Follow stephmerry If Americans are getting bigger as were constantly reminded we are we need a movie villain that can keep pace. Thats one thing the disaster flick ""Into the Storm"" has going for it. The tornado that threatens to decimate Silverton Okla. during the movies climax isnt so much a well-defined cyclone as an amorphous blob that lumbers destructively across great distances. Its the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man of twisters. The tornado accomplishes awe- inspiring feats such as sucking up a whole tarmac of airplanes into its orbit and wiping out entire neighborhoods. But for all the movies grandiose annihilation there also is action so absurd and emotion so saccharine that the likelihood of involuntary laughter is high. Director Steven Quale (""Final Destination 5"") and writer John Swetnam (""Step Up All In"") clearly know that the disaster- movie thing has been done to death and so in addition to the bigger-is-better approach they also offer up another fresh angle by adding a found footage element. We see video from the cameras of high school-aged brothers Trey (Nathan Kress) and Donnie (Max Deacon) and security footage from the school where their father (Richard Armitage) is assistant principal. We get the angles from a storm-chasing team that includes ornery documentarian Pete (Matt Walsh) and scientist Allison (Sarah Wayne Callies). For a bit of comic relief we also witness the misadventures of aspiring YouTube celebrities Donk (Kyle Davis) and Reevis (Jon Reep). The pair perfectly encapsulate the movies biggest drawback which is weak and lazy storytelling. Donk and Reevis are redneck stereotypes brainless and drunken rubes with thick accents and a spray-painted sign on the back of their pickup that reads ""Twista Hunterz."" For the most part the movie is at its best when the special effects are front and center and grouchy Pete or cheeky Trey are spouting those goofy one-liners that action movies are now required to have. But sometimes even the destruction becomes silly. When a character gets sucked up into a tornado made of fire even impressive computer-generated magic cant transcend reminders of the inane cult hit ""Sharknado."" The found footage element can also be distracting. When Donnie and his crush find themselves trapped in an abandoned building and shes whimpering for help with a cut ankle he has to take a few moments to set up his camera to catch their every move. And then there are the moments when the movie abandons the found footage approach altogether. On the plus side ""Into the Storm"" doesnt drag. That may sound like small praise for a movie with such bombastic special effects but it really is impressive given that ""Into the Storm"" consists mainly of watching characters run from various little tornadoes before they have to take cover from a very large one.  1/2 PG-13. At area theaters. Contains sequences of intense destruction and language including some sexual references. 89 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 348 a.m. EDT August 8 2014Awkward performances make audiences long for disaster sequences over quieter moments.Sarah Wayne Callies in Into the Storm.(Photo Warner Bros. Pictures)Action-thriller Into the Storm chronicles a terrible horrible no-good very bad day for residents in an Oklahoma town.Over the course of a few hours an unprecedented series of deadly cyclones categorized as EF5 tornadoes strikes with winds whipping at more than 200 mph. Viewers are dramatically thrust via powerful computer-generated images into the eye of the storm ( out four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide).It has been 18 years since Twister so apparently we were due for another tornado assault. And this time theres a lot more mayhem to contend with than flying cows.School buses barns and airplanes are buffeted or sent spinning into oblivion within the eye of a 2-mile-wide twister. The turmoil makes the cyclone in The Wizard of Oz look like a skip down the yellow brick road. If only characters as fully developed as Dorothy and her merry band of misfits were around to make us care about the human wreckage.The special effects are skillfully wrought scary and exciting. But when the story focuses on those weathering the onslaught things are far less thrilling.As meteorologist Allison (Sarah Wayne Callies) puts it nothing has been quite the same since hurricanes Katrina and Sandy. While the words ""climate change"" are never uttered -- most likely for fear of turning off non-believers and limiting box office potential -- the concept hangs over the movie like the darkest of clouds.Much of the movie is mired in clunky exposition and only the two lead characters played by Richard Armitage and Callies are believable.USA TODAYThe latest movie reviewsUSA TODAYUSA TODAYs guide to summer moviesArmitage plays Gary a high school vice principal and widowed father. Initially hes distracted and tough on his teen sons Trey (Nathan Kress) and Donnie (Max Deacon). They start out shooting a time-capsule video but the found-footage gimmick is later abandoned in favor of more straightforward storytelling. Hackneyed dialogue persists however.Last seen on the big screen as Thorin in The Hobbit films Armitage acquits himself well as a man who rises to the occasion heroically protecting his sons students and others. As Allison Callies is credible as a scientist forced to leave her 5-year-old daughter with her parents as she accompanies storm chasers filming a documentary.The team is made up of cranky meteorology pro Pete (Matt Walsh) eager cameramen Daryl (Arlen Escarpeta) and nervous cameraman Jacob (Jeremy Sumpter). They trundle around in the Titus an armored vehicle equipped to withstand massive winds.Some tone-deaf comic relief is injected for no value whatsoever in the form of Reevis (Jon Reep) and Donk (Kyle Davis) a pair of good ol boy amateur twister chasers. More thought seems to have gone into their monikers than their story lines.A subplot involving Donnie and Kaitlyn (Alycia Debnam-Carey) a classmate he has has a crush on has little of the poignancy it strives for.One-dimensional characters play second fiddle to the main event. Given the large cast of faceless players its hard to care when a few get sucked into oblivion.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare One town is ravaged be several tornadoes that move in an erratic ways terrorizing the town in Into the Storm.

Photo Warner Bros. MOVIE REVIEW Into the Storm Running time 89 minutes. Rated PG-13 (intense destruction and peril vulgar language). The found-footage disaster flick ""Into the Storm is ""Twister for dummies but by no means is that an insult. The new film is enormous fun if youre in the right mood. For starters its just 89 minutes long several of them devoted to listing its special-effects technicians in the closing credits. And the special effects are much better than you might expect from the trailers -- and from a medium-budget film without big stars like ""Twister"" headliner Helen Hunt who often demand big dramatic scenes that tend to slow down the movie. The effects in ""Into the Storm"" may not be state-of-the-art but they get the job done -- and theres lots of wham bang thank you man Matt Walsh (the affable Mike McLintock of HBOs ""Veep) is very funny as Pete the gung-ho leader of a team of professional storm chasers whos going to lose his heavily armored truck unless he comes up with hurricane footage stat. The cast tries to take cover in ""Into the Storm.""Photo Warner Bros. Pictures The other adult lead is Richard Armitage -- the British actor taking a break from playing Thorin Oakenshield in ""The Hobbit trilogy -- as Gary a widowed assistant principal at a high school in an unidentified Midwestern state thats nearly ground zero for killer tornadoes. Will Gary be able to rescue his son who becomes trapped in an old mill with a sexy classmate (Alycia Debnam Carey) after the first of the twisters hits? And will he hook up with the single-mom meteorologist who persuades a reluctant Pete to help? That ultimately matters less than seeing whether Pete scores the ultimate money shot -- and seeing what happens when one of his camera assistants gets caught in a twister thats sucking up flaming gasoline. There are no ""Twister-like flying cows in ""Into the Storm but theres an airborne tractor trailer and all sorts of creative mayhem as the fictional town of Silverton is flattened by a series of progressively stronger -- and highly photogenic -- digitally-created tornadoes that make the one impersonated by a muslin stocking in ""The Wizard of Oz seem benign. Director Steven Quale a veteran of the ""Final Destination series expertly uses the shaky-cam format to freshen up the disaster genre though he cheats with shots that couldnt possibly be captured by one of the characters cameras. And screenwriter John Swetnam (also credited with the new ""Step Up All In"") name-checks John Updike as he cooks up an army of stereotypical characters. ""Into the Storm delivers where it counts though -- it moves like lightning with loads of well-staged disaster footage and a pulse-pounding climax with the mother of all twisters and a heroic sacrifice.

The story is told through the eyes of storm chasers thrill-seeking amateurs and courageous townspeople. Bill Goodykoontz USA TODAY NETWORK 1210 p.m. MST August 8 2014Steven Quales film plays like a special-effects demonstration in search of a story but the storms are impressive.A film crew captions an oncoming twister in the film ""Into The Storm.""(Photo Warner Bros. Pictures)Story HighlightsCritics review 2.5 starsSeveral stories are scattered about but its all filler.The visual effects are impressive and seemingly realistic.Storm-chasers down on their luck cross paths with a family in the path of the tornadoes.""Into the Storm"" plays like a special-effects demonstration in search of a movie but you have to give it to the filmmakers They take no half-measures.The film which among other things follows unlucky storm chasers as they hunt for tornadoes doesnt just stop with one twister. No. Wheres the fun in that? There are follow-up tornadoes defying the odds. There is the biggest tornado of all time.Sure fine whatever. All very impressive all very intense. But you know youve really gone over the top when you see the flaming tornado.Why not?There are actually strands of several stories scattered throughout the film which is composed mostly of fake found footage from various sources but director Steven Quale and screenwriter John Swetnam are smart enough to know who their real star is the funnel cloud.Pete (Matt Walsh) is the aforementioned storm chaser. He has developed a tanklike vehicle that will withstand winds of up to 170 mph; he wants to film the eye of a tornado as it rushes over top of him. He has a crew that includes Allison (Sarah Wayne Callies) a meteorologist who despite having a van full of equipment seems to get all of her information from the Weather Channel.AZCENTRALSomething for everyone 52 Fall films for 2014They need a big storm because theyre in the middle of a yearlong dry spell and the money people behind the film theyre making are threatening to pull the plug if they dont find something dramatic and fast.Meanwhile Gary (Richard Armitage) an assistant principal and his sons Donnie (Max Deacon) and Trey (Nathan Kress) are getting ready for graduation day at their high school. Gary has enlisted his sons to make video time capsules so there are plenty of cameras on-hand.Donnie gets sidetracked helping Kaitlyn (Alycia Debnam Carey) with a video project at an abandoned industrial site. So weve got desperate storm chasers a high-school graduation in the middle of an open field and a couple of kids isolated in a dilapidated building. Toss a couple of nitwit redneck would-be stuntmen (Kyle Davis and Jon Reep) with smartphone cameras (the only smart thing about them) into the mix and you have plenty of tornado fodder.AZCENTRALAll the reviews Weekend movie guide for PhoenixThere will be sacrifice and loss and heroism in the manner of disaster movies. But mostly there are really strong winds. Remember in ""The Wizard of Oz"" when the twister hit and Dorothy saw all manner of things going up in the funnel (including mean old Miss Gulch)?Imagine that except with jets and tractor-trailer trucks being sucked in and tossed around like toys.The story is just filler. Really the effects are the only thing about ""Into the Storm"" that will ... blow you away.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Disaster movies are by design not long on character development. Instead they bank on our love of being virtually vicariously in fear for lives. Still they need to establish personalities deep enough to care about or at least halfheartedly root for. Despite spending the first interminable 20 minutes attempting just that in the earnestly unrealistic manner of an after-school special ""Into the Storm"" quickly spirals downward into a vortex of vapidity. The action transpires in a single momentous day in the life of small-town Silverton Okla. where an assistant high school principal (Richard Armitage best known for playing Thorin in the ""Hobbit"" films) and his two teen sons prepare for a graduation ceremony destined to be interrupted by an unrelenting series of mighty winds. Meanwhile a group of storm chasers including meteorologist Allison (Sarah Wayne Callies of ""The Walking Dead"") are casing the joint following a twister that recently claimed the lives of four teens in a car. Shoved in for meager comic relief are Donk and Reevis (which not coincidentally rhymes with Beevis) a slack-jawed ""Jackass""-wannabe duo. Director Steven Quale who honed his craft under James Cameron on ""Titanic"" and ""Avatar"" takes full advantage of digital enhancements made available since Miss Gulch rode her bicycle across the sky in ""The Wizard of Oz"" but also effectively adds realism with some handheld camera work and footage shot by real-life storm chasers. Trouble is after the first few roof-ripping tornadoes tear through town the movie is oddly short on suspense. The snakes nest of funnel clouds racing across the terrain packing winds of 200 miles per hour often seem to pause conveniently for a line or two of stilted dialogue to be uttered. The biggest nail-biter of a scene involves not whirling tornadic activity but rather two teens stuck under debris as water rises to their chins. INTO THE STORM 1/2 out of 4 stars Rated PG-13 for for sequences of intense destruction and language including some sexual references. The numbing effect of seeing so many objects and the occasional human buffeted about and sucked into the ether forces the mind to wander. Where did the hundreds of other Silverton residents go and why is there no evidence of carnage not so much as a random severed limb alongside all the flattened buildings and crumpled cars? Why were a bunch of semitrucks lined up next to some passenger jets other than that they look so cool somersaulting through the turbulent air side by side? Why would you seek shelter in a storm drain right after two in your party almost drowned from being trapped in water? Such questions wouldnt occur if you were on the edge of your seat. But the biggest lesson of ""Into the Storm"" -- beyond ensuring youre near a concrete underground bunker at all times -- is that story still rules.

Entertainment Inc. Into the StormA is at once one of the dumbest films youll see this year and one of the scariest. Why is it that Hollywood finds it so hard to create a compelling story around weather disasters? Not unlikeA Twister which a mere 18 years ago took one of the silliest of scripts and profitably wedded it to state-of-the-art CGI effectsA Into the StormA seems to understand that even the dumbest of characters can be redeemed when faced with the imminent threat of getting vacuumed up into a terrifying funnel cloud. The film makes a few initial stabs at realism as it starts off looking like it may be another found-footage flick. Practically all the characters are wielding cameras for different purposes as they converge on the doomed town of Silverton. Theres Donnie (Max Deacon) an AV Club geek whos been tasked by his dad (Richard Armitage) the vice-principal of the local high school to record their graduation ceremony but who instead opts to light off with the school cutie (Alycia Debnam Carey) to help her with a fortuitously timed video project. Then theres Pete Moore (Matt Walsh) the veteran leader of a group of eager-beaver storm chasers desperate to use their state-of-the-art tanklike van to document the eye of a tornado in an effort to compete with all the free storm footage crowding YouTube. Theres also Don (Kyle Davis) and Reevis (Jon Reep) a couple of hillbilly dumbshits who like to film themselves doing Jackass-like stunts because I guess the movies idiot index wasnt high enough. Related Stories Deepsea Challenge 3D Dives to the Bottom of the Ocean and the Depths of James Cameron For a Movie About Talking Reptiles Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Takes Itself Way Too Seriously To its credit Into the Storm drops the found-footage conceit fairly early on Director Steven Quale knows we dont just want to watch storms from the point of view of peoples shaky video cameras however cheated; we want to see wide all-encompassing shots of giant twisters taking out entire airports and shredding highways and towns and whatnot. Unfortunately the film doesnt drop the conceit early enough to avoid the clunky exposition that seems to be a prerequisite for found-footage flicks. (Consider Donnie preparing a school ""time-capsule project"" to create a video message to his future self goes around introducing his father and his brother to the camera -- because if hell need to be reminded of anything years from now its who his father and brother were.) And then the fucking tornadoes arrive and everything changes. These arent just ordinary twisters; theyre the kind you see in your worst nightmares. Giant ones that seem a mile wide or families of twisters that corner small armies of cars barreling down highways. The effects are vivid and Quale who came up through the ranks working for James Cameron doing second unit on Avatar and Titanic does a nice job mixing awe-inspiring wide shots that take in the scale of the storms with the more intimate carnage occurring on the ground. He still cant direct a performance to save his life but lets give him credit for the things he does well. Indeed sometimes you wonder if in some twisted way these cardboard characters not to mention their ridiculous dialogue (""This is the biggest storm there has ever been"") might be an asset. The distance allows us to enjoy the spectacle of all this destruction without having to be reminded of the tragic fact that real people die in real storms all the time. At one point a tornado hits a highway fire and we get a giant flaming funnel cloud; when a person is sucked into it they flail and burn and spin and you dont know whether to scream or laugh. You might consider doing both -- which is probably a good way to approach this entire movie.

A Midwestern town is battered by tornadoes. Director Steven Quale (129). PG-13 Violence and peril language. Area theaters. ""Sharknado"" taught us that theres fun in B-movie cheesiness. But Steven Quales unabashedly clunky ""Into the Storm"" lacks the winking self-awareness of the Syfy channels disaster epics. And you definitely wont find the quality of ""Twister"" which managed to earn two technical Oscar nominations in 1997. Still Quale is committed to his concept which is to whip up the coolest weather-related effects he can imagine. So if youre willing to treat the stiff dialogue and uneven performances as so much light drizzle its easy enough to get caught up in the action. Matt Walsh (TVs ""Veep"") plays the perpetually angry Pete a storm-chasing documentarian frustrated at failing to document any storms. Hes about to lose funding and wants to fire his staff but his meteorologist Allison (""The Walking Deads"" Sarah Wayne Callies) promises a big ones coming. As Pete Allison and their crew head into the eye of the storm local dad Gary (Richard Armitage) is trying to get his teen sons to safety. Trey (Nathan Kress) is accounted for but Donnie (Max Deacon) has disappeared. This becomes a problem after the first cyclone tears through their Midwestern town providing a preview of whats to come. Once Quale and writer John Swetnam get their generic setup out of the way they can loosen up and treat the tornadoes like the villains they are. The effectively simulated storms with their massive wreckage start to feel like monsters stalking the heroes. Richard Armitage on the run in Into the Storm (Ron Phillips) Callies is the only cast member who stands out but Quale knows how to distract us from pesky complaints about character development (is that cyclone made of fire? ) or plot contrivances ( whoa did they just lift an entire airport into the sky?). Sure the filmmakers could have upped the stakes with social commentary wry humor or an unexpected twist or two. But who needs twists when youve got a trio of twisters merging ahead? eweitzmannydailynews.com Tags movies movie reviews into the storm steven quale richard armitage sarah wayne callies matt walsh max deacon nathan kress action Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Comments (1) click to enlarge Into the Storm Video Rated PG-13  89 minutes  2014 David Koechners recent performance as a wealthy sadist in the low-budget drama Cheap Thrills ranks among the more interesting screen performances this year. A veteran character actor best known for playing cartoon idiots (Anchorman The Legend of Rob Burgundy NBCs The Office) Koechner is surprisingly convincing as the films mephistophelean villain who coerces the hapless protagonists into performing a series of degrading stunts. Koechners comedy background is evident in his boisterous line readings which sound vaguely funny even when his character says awful things. Rather than diminish the movies sinister tone however he enhances it inspiring uneasy sympathy for a reprehensible character by making him the most charming presence onscreen.

Johnson kjohnsonpost-dispatch.com 314-340-8191 Kevin C. Johnson Aug 7 2014 (...) ""Into the Storm"" ""Into the Storm"" ""Into the Storm"" ""Into the Storm"" ""Into the Storm"" The saving grace for disaster flick ""Into the Storm"" None of the numerous tornadoes swirling about spew sharks.Thats worth mentioning in the wake of the awfulness of ""Sharknado"" and ""Sharknado 2."" ""Into the Storm"" by comparison is more rooted in real-life terror Hollywood-style.Coming off like ""Twister"" on steroids the generically titled ""Into the Storm"" takes place over the course of a single day in the small town of Silverton. A tornado opens the film sweeping away a group of teenagers -- just a hint of things to come as twisters continually drop down from the sky colliding to form an even larger threat.But before reaching those cinematic goods theres the lengthy set-up of getting to know the characters which hardly ever seems worth it. Director Steven Quale also uses a loose found-footage approach that goes in and out.Nearly every character in Silverton seems to have a reason to carry a video camera. The young Trey (Nathan Kress) is tasked with filming the high school graduation. His brother Donnie (Max Deacon) is helping his crush Kaitlyn (Alicia Debnam Carey) shoot something for her college admissions exam. Meteorologist Allison (Sarah Wayne Callies) and director Pete (Matt Walsh) head up a storm-chasing crew working on a documentary.And we cant forget the scrappy group of daredevils who hope their exclusive storm footage makes them YouTube sensations. They all get more than they bargained for when the town is hit repeatedly leading to several well-shot nail-biting set pieces that thrill playing out better in theaters than they do in the TV trailers. Money that was saved in hiring a mostly unknown cast (one exception is Richard Armitage from ""The Hobbit"") was clearly thrown into special effects. Cows flying through the air arent enough for ""Into the Storm."" Airplanes are lifted off the runway to take flight in a whole new way. Homes are shredded to bits. A character trapped within the eye of the superstorm realizes the beauty found there until the inevitable happens.While the devastation is plentiful human loss is noticeable while also downplayed for a PG-13 rating. Not all of it makes sense but for disaster movie fans ""Into the Storm"" has enough destruction to go around.What ""Into the Storm""  Two and a half stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 129  Content Sequences of intense destruction and peril and language including some sexual references Kevin C.

It incorporates footage ostensibly shot by the characters among more traditional camerawork and filming technique. The hybrid end results follows the misadventures of a group of storm trackers led by Matt Walsh as documentary film maker Pete and Sarah Wayne Callies as meteorologist Allison as they look for tornado trouble near the heartland small-town of Silverton. Theres also of course footage shot by on-the-ground Silvertonians including Max Deacons Donnie assigned by Richard Armitage as his vice-principal dad Gary to videotape the high schools graduation day. As dark clouds rush across the horizon and start churning themselves into mega-storms however Donnies cameras and Petes equipment are going to take in a lot more than the people behind the cameras are expecting to see. See video Into the Storm Trailer Threatens to Blow Audiences Away (Video) You cannot fault ""Into the Storm"" for doing what it says on the tin theres plenty of CGI-tornado action perilous dangers close shaves and brutal tragedy. Director Steven Quale previously gave us ""Final Destination 5"" where horror-movie fate built up to clever squirm-inducing sequences of trouble for the characters. Here though hes upped the level of destruction while simultaneously decreasing our interest; tornadoes as random acts of weather and God are hard to endow with meaning or motivation. Mixing mayhem and melodrama ""Into the Storm"" stumbles from set-piece to set-piece as the film progresses through its reed-slender 89-minute running time. Were told that the efforts of Pete and his storm trackers will result in data that could save lives a la ""Twister"" but we also get to see a fire-tornado suck up and ignite supporting characters. Theres discussion of how global weather patterns are getting worse and we see a mega tornado sweep through an airport and toss jumbo jets into the sky like the playthings of an angry childish giant. The effects are both impressive and somewhat off-the-rack at the same time; when a cow-sign flies off a building in Silvertons downtown its hard not to note another nod to ""Twister"" the 1996 tornado-disaster would-be epic about storm-chasers and storms which had the benefit of being shot as a film with stationary cameras. The gimmick behind ""Into the Storm"" intended to provide you-are-there immediacy couldnt be more distancing keeping you at arms length from the material beyond even your constant desire to yell at the characters to stop filming and you know run. The performances are perfunctory Walsh a gifted comedic actor plays Pete as a two-dimensional driven jerk while Callies counsels caution in between calls to her daughter back home. The gruff distant Gary as played by Armitage reconciles with his sons as he saves them. Theres also two characters intended as condescending comedy relief  would-be YouTube stars straight out of ""Hee Haw"" Kyle Davis Donk and Jon Reeps Reevis who go over like lead balloons no matter how high the wind gusts. Also read Into the Storms Steven Quale to Direct Hunter Killer for Relativity (Exclusive) The effects team led by Randall Starr (""Journey 2 The Mysterious Island"") has great fun with the films more outlandish moments of destruction -- schools cars and trees all wiped from the face of the earth as if God scratched his thumb hard over the landscape -- but the ever-increasing fury and number of the storms just becomes sound and fury signifying very little a spectacle thats not especially spectacular. Screenwriter John Swetnam (also the writer behind this weeks ""Step Up All In"") slots typical and tired disaster-movie modules between the destruction sequences; cell phones cut out at conveniently inconvenient times trapped youths try to survive as the water rises characters pause for deep self-contemplation as they take shelter in a church a community pillar fails to grasp the scope or scale of the disaster approaching the innocents hes charged with protecting. Those plug-and-play sequences are all Swetnam has to offer though. Worst of all the start of the film involves so much exposition; about the graduation about Petes documentary about Gary and Donnies friction about the schools video time capsule; that youd be pardoned for thinking the films killer storms are caused by all the hot air produced by the characters venting so many factoids in the name of set-up. Also read Divergents Parker Mack Joins Matt Walsh in Blumhouses 6 Miranda Drive (Exclusive) With its pointless POV device and paper-thin characters whipped around by wicked winds ""Into the Storm"" is intended as late-summer B-movie distraction but it gets a D-grade. If you have to pick a stupid climate-crisis picture in 2014 well at least ""Sharknado 2 The Second One"" has a sense of humor about itself. At the climax of ""Into the Storm"" colossal tornadoes make noise blow things up and go around in circles; thats pretty much all the film does too. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Max Deacon Richard Armitage and Nathan Kress find themselves facing ""Into the Storm."" Although Steven Quales film never forgets the human face of disaster the special effects are the stars of the show. Photo Ron Phillips Movie review Into the Storm effects will blow you away 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Into the Storm Action drama. Starring Richard Armitage Sarah Wayne Callies Matt Walsh Max Deacon and Alycia Debnam Carey. Directed by Steven Quale. (PG-13. 89 minutes.) Maybe someday in the distant future the special effects technology in ""Into the Storm"" will look fake and make audiences snicker. But today its hard to imagine any movie ever topping this ones depiction of killer tornadoes laying waste to the Midwest. Short of sweeping the entire audience up into a holographic tornado while high winds blow the other spectators around nothing will lay a glove on ""Into the Storm"" as the ultimate weather disaster extravaganza. Its all about the storms. As for the characters they dont get in the way - or rather they do get in the way of the storm but they dont steal the focus. They are there to put a human face on the disaster so that we have some stake in the spectacle and to that extent they serve a real function. But that spectacle is the star. Picture this A huge tornado rips its way into a gas station. The station explodes into a gasoline fire and within seconds the fire is sucked all the way up into the tornado so that now its a fire tornado burning and shredding everything in sight - and sucking people into it. That is people stupid enough to be standing there with a camera thinking how many hits theyre going to get on YouTube. ""Into the Storm"" runs a brisk 89 minutes and for every second of its running time finds ways to make tornadoes interesting. Theres no repetition. Tornadoes head straight toward us then veer off 30 feet to the left. Tornadoes form in the sky. Tornadoes pop up right left and center simultaneously and zigzag in every possible terrifying direction. A tornado cuts through a used car dealership and a bus depot and that looks like something. But no you havent seen anything until youve seen tornadoes hit an airport. The aerodynamics of the airplanes make them look at home in the vortex like lost and forlorn dolphins floating and bobbing in the sky and waiting to be dropped. The human perspective is never forgotten. The movie begins with high school kids in a car at night watching as a tornado sucks up the streetlights ahead. They see nothing just odd little explosions coming closer - and then theyre airborne. We also get an idea of what it might be like to be crouching in a building waiting for the tornado to hit as the crushing noise - like a New York subway only worse - comes roaring and rattling closer. What a weird thing to be standing in the road feeling only a strong breeze while a hundred feet away some hellish funnel like the finger of an angry god is lobbing trucks and disassembling buildings. It is a magnificent horror and it never gets old. Theres just enough in the story to make it seem personal. Theres a team of scientific tornado chasers photographers and scientists including a tornado expert (Sarah Wayne Callies) who cant wait to return to her daughter. Theres also a high school graduation in the path of the storm and a high school principal trying to find his missing teenage son. Perhaps the best measure of the storys effectiveness is that given the choice between heightened spectacle and human life the audiences emotional impulse is always toward human life. Except in the case of the cameraman who gets sucked into the gasoline vortex - thats just too good to resist - whenever someone is holding on for dear life we hope they maintain their grip. We believe just enough to make ""Into the Storm"" more riveting. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

TWITTER Impressive special effects re-create a gigantic destructive tornado. Warner Bros. the studio that distributed Twister (1996) and The Perfect Storm (2000) is now releasing Into the Storm about the biggest tornado of all time. Does a studio once known for its topical socially conscious dramas now aim to corner the market on meteorological disaster movies? How the mighty have fallen. Directed by Steven Quale who worked on the James Cameron blockbusters Titanic and Avatar this movie is a formidable technical achievement. Since the no-name cast wont draw crowds everything depends on the eagerness of young audiences to step aboard the roller coaster. Box office prospects are uncertain. Theres only the most minimal story and the film probably spends too much time introducing a band of generic characters before the storm actually hits. The main character is Gary (Richard Armitage) the vice principal at a high school in the fictional Midwestern town of Silverton. Gary is a single father raising two teenage sons Donnie (Max Deacon) and Trey (Nathan Kress). Newcomers in town are the meteorological team headed by weather expert Allison (Sarah Wayne Callies) and storm chaser Pete (Matt Walsh). Also along for the ride are two semi-stoned daredevils who want to get as close to the storm as possible. What links all of these characters is that most of them are wielding handheld cameras and much of the action is presented through the lenses of the characters cameras. But this gimmick has been more inventively deployed in many other films and it isnt even consistently used here. The script by John Swetnam is rudimentary with only the most minimal and pallid stabs at characterization. A father is preoccupied the sons are rebellious and a couple of romances percolate. Nothing about these mini-melodramas is unique or interesting. Nevertheless once the funnel clouds begin swirling Quale and his special effects team achieve some remarkably authentic and frightening moments.  We dont get a reprise of the flying cow from Twister but plenty of cars trucks and even planes at the local airport are tossed into the air and come crashing down with a deafening thud. The movie races along; its swift and unpretentious clocking in at just under 90 minutes. Theres genuine suspense in the sequence when Donnie and his new girlfriend (Alycia Debnam-Carey) are trapped underground in a mill that begins flooding. Production designer David Sandefur deserves praise for the landscapes of destruction that hes engineered. The score by Brian Tyler helps to keep the tension building. Although the actors dont have any lifting to do theyre attractive and likable. The British-born Armitage may be too stolid and Deacon is a tad too lightweight. But Kress as the wisecracking younger brother is very appealing and the lovely Callies is thoroughly convincing and sympathetic as the weather woman with a conscience. Still no one goes to a movie like this to appreciate the fine acting or the elegant dialogue. You hold on to your seat as the storm uproots everything in sight. Yet the movie awakens a certain moral queasiness. Considering the terrible human costs of storms like Sandy and Katrina isnt it a bit unseemly to turn these tragedies into pure popcorn entertainment? At one point Allison observes that storms that used to be once-in-a-lifetime events have become annual nightmares. But if youre looking for any commentary about the role of climate change in producing these perfectly monstrous storms you wont find it here. Instead this film exploits horrendous real-world suffering for the sake of a mindless thrill ride and no matter how well executed the havoc may be that leaves a sour aftertaste.

Back in ye olde summer of 1996 few could have imagined that we would eventually look back fondly on Jan de Bonts ""Twister"" as the kind of movie ""they"" dont make like they used to. And yet a scant two decades later here comes ""Into the Storm"" to prime that nostalgic tear. An all-but-official redo of de Bonts film for the YouTube/Instagram generation director Steven Quales found-footage Frankenstorm extravaganza generates even more racket than its predecessor (especially in theaters equipped with the new Dolby Atmos sound system) and markedly less human interest -- up to and including a shameless heart-tugging coda that wraps itself in Old Glory more snugly than a Tea Party sleepover. Ultimately little more than a feature-length demo reel for nine credited VFX companies this mid-budget New Line Cinema slate filler may earn some quick late-summer coin from undiscriminating teen auds; all others are advised to save it for a very rainy day. Beyond the many self-conscious ""Twister"" callbacks -- the small-town Oklahoma setting the teams of rival storm chasers a storm of golf-ball-sized hail an airborne cow -- screenwriter John Swetnam (last years dreary ""Evidence"") and Quale (""Final Destination 5"") do themselves no additional favors by making copious nods in the direction of Quales own filmmaking mentor James Cameron which only serve to underscore how difficult it is to replicate Camerons precision-calibrated balance of the human and the humongous. By the time Quale (who served as second unit director on ""Titanic"" and ""Avatar"") gives us his own version of star-crossed teenage lovers holding on to each other for dear life in a rapidly flooding basement its the movie itself thats barely treading water. Elsewhere he has made over ""Veep"" actor Matt Walsh into a veritable dead ringer for Cameron as Pete Moore a dogged storm-chasing documentary filmmaker determined to get ""the shot of the century."" At least Pete has something resembling an actual personality in a movie where most of the characters are so plastic you have to remind yourself this isnt a sequel to ""The Lego Movie."" (It seems a safe bet that this cast does not include two future Oscar winners a la ""Twisters"" Helen Hunt and Philip Seymour Hoffman.) Front and center is stolid Silverton High School vice principal Gary (""The Hobbit"" star Richard Armitage) and the two teenage sons from whom he has become predictably distant following the predictably untimely death of the boys mother (who for added value was also divorced from Gary). So the Freudian storm clouds hover thickly before the atmospheric ones have even moved in -- which when they do make a beeline for the school on graduation day. Hot on their trail are Pete and his team consisting of an unsurprisingly green camera operator (Jeremy Sumpter) who wonders if the job is really worth the risk and a single-mom meteorologist (Sarah Wayne Callies) who Skypes with her 5-year-old daughter whenever she isnt barreling into the eye of the storm -- proof positive that a modern career woman really can have it all job family and funnel cloud. Traveling in a souped-up storm-chasing vehicle called the Titus (as in Andronicus) that resembles an Abrams Battle Tank crossed with a weather balloon Pete and company -- but mainly Pete -- obsess over getting the high-impact shots that will make them all famous (at least among viewers of the Discovery Channel) lest their entire endeavor turn into ""the most expensive homemovie ever made."" Intentionally or not that isnt a bad description of ""Into the Storm"" itself which flickers and flits between several streams of supposed user-generated video -- call it ""The Blair Witch Weather Report."" Every character in the movie is pointing and shooting all the time the Titus crew; the Silverton student body (asked to make ""time capsule"" videos to their future selves); and amateur Jackasses Donk (Kyle Davis) and Reevis (Jon Reep) who follow the Titus in a beat-up sedan christened ""Twista Hunterz"" seeking their own shot at YouTube glory. (Intended as the films comic relief they are more of a pestilence of whom one keeps wishing that the storm will make haste.) Garys eldest (and moodiest) son Donnie (Max Deacon) even skips out on the graduation festivities to help his fellow junior and unrequited sweetheart Kaitlyn (Alycia Debnam-Carey) reshoot parts of an activist documentary shes making about an abandoned paper mill at the edge of town -- eh kids these days -- and of course keeps rolling even after the whole place caves in trapping them under the rubble. Well theres nothing like a little cataclysm to make the heart grow fonder ""Into the Storm"" suggests. And if its cataclysm you want Quale serves it up in spades. Blackening the skies and spouting multiple simultaneous funnels like some eight-legged Tarantulado(tm) the movies title star cuts such a ferocious swath through the land that it makes the flood from ""Noah"" seem almost a sunshower by comparison. And while the elaborate CG destruction never quite approaches the photo-real some of the imagery does have an almost surreal kick to it (like the shot already given away by the films trailer of multiple jumbo jets taking to the skies solely under wind power). At its best ""Into the Storm"" is like a really high-tech version of those science-museum wind-tunnel simulators that thrill groups of touring schoolchildren with their roaring blasts of hurricane-force gales. But stretched out to even 90 minutes such thrills become monotonous and by the time the film arrives at a climax that finds most of the cast waylaid in a storm drain the effect is like sitting through all the cycles of some ultra-super-deluxe gas-station car wash. Still better that than when Swetnam and Quale attempt to wax contemplatively about the ethics of our image making and consumption in our DIY video culture -- a subject explored with far greater nuance (and less emphatic drum-beating) by George Romeros ""Diary of the Dead"" and Brian De Palmas ""Redacted"" still the best of all the post-""Blair Witch"" reality-horror pics. ""Into the Storm"" can make it rain like nobodys business but when it tries to be smart it comes out all wet. Film Review Into the StormReviewed at AMC Loews Lincoln Square New York Aug. 3 2014.

Reply Blonde blue-eyed Jesus says August 7 2014 at 1129 am Its a wonder this is even making it into theaters. Theres absolutely NO reason for this movie to exist and the entire premise makes no sense -- incredible footage of storms have at most a 24 hour fame cycle on YouTube and The Today Show then theyre gone forever. So the idea that this guy thinks hes going to get famous (or whatever) by capturing the perfect shot is utter nonsense -- and the kids whom this film purports to target will be the first ones to call bullshit. At least in ""Twister"" the motivation of the lead was somewhat credible -- he needed to put his ping-pong balls into the center of a tornado to get data that no one has ever obtained to prevent future disasters. You know...science. But I guess thats too much to ask of a bunch of 40 year-olds trying to appeal to 15 year-olds by stringing a bunch of cliches and over-produced vfx together. Reply MickeyMad says August 7 2014 at 844 am Its a shame they didnt release this in 3D. It is a perfect subject matter for it and it seems like a no-brainer. I suspect it also would have pushed the box office to new heights. It sounds like its basically a slasher film for disaster fans. Unfortunate the producers couldnt have seen this obvious fit.

"Into the Storm movie review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review Into the Storm  1/2 Into the Storm sacrifices plot for funneling visuals The aftermath of ""Into the Storm"" may leave viewers impressed with its ""souped-up"" effects like some storm movies of the past have says Tribune film critic Michael Phillips. But the films gusto ends there. The aftermath of ""Into the Storm"" may leave viewers impressed with its ""souped-up"" effects like some storm movies of the past have says Tribune film critic Michael Phillips. But the films gusto ends there. Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Into the Storm blows into theaters and unlike Sharknado 2 there are no sharks in this toothless disaster film Like ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" ""Ma and Pa Kettle at Waikiki"" and ""Dude Wheres My Car?"" ""Into the Storm"" is a movie. And like the wind this particular movie blows tall unstable columns of hot air willy-nilly.In the spirit of ""Sharknado"" and ""Sharknado 2"" ""Into the Storm"" eventually goes into blender mode and mixes its elements of wind column terror smoothie-style. At one point one of the twisters (there are several though only one provokes the line ""This is the biggest tornado Ive ever seen"") sucks up gasoline from a wiped-out petroleum semi which leads to a tornado on fire -- a firenado. Little else in ""Into the Storm"" could be described as dramatically fiery. Remember ""Twister"" in 1996 the one with Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman working out their personal problems while chasing storms? This ones like that but on roughly half the budget. (The film cost around 50 million with half the budget going to visual effects.) The storm chasers this time are led by a tense Ahab type (Matt Walsh) whose documentary film crew rides around in a modified tank. Theyve been on the road three months with no decent tornado footage to show for it. Frustrating So little human life wastedBut the woman of science among them the comely Allison (Sarah Wayne Callies of ""The Walking Dead"") says go north young storm chasers head north to the town of Silverton. (The state is unspecified; the movie itself was filmed in Michigan.) There a high school graduation is underway. Top-billed Richard Armitage an Englishman doing his best generic heartland dialect plays an irritable widower with two teenage boys struggling to connect with their father. Donnie (Max Deacon) is supposed to film the graduation but hes off with a fellow student (Alycia Debnam Carey) working on her school project in an abandoned mill outside of town. Terrible terrible timing because conditions are rough and everyone knows its windy and windy has stormy eyes that flash at the sound of lies. ""Its regenerating"" Allison says at one point adding ""These updrafts are insane""A good deal of screenwriter John Swetnams dialogue sounds like auto-corrected exposition designed to reveal nothing in the way of character. Much of the dialogue is cellphone-coverage-related. ""Theres no signal"" someone says followed a few minutes later by ""Still no signal.""Nobody watches a disaster movie starring digital tornadoes expecting Oscar Wilde. But ""Into the Storm"" directed with bland efficiency by Steven Quayle of ""Final Destination 5"" reminds us that unless a movie establishes certain base-line levels of human interest it runs the not-unentertaining risk of coming out squarely in favor of its own bad weather. There is a moment an extended moment when Donnies stuck underneath rubble and the waters gushing in and its rising and getting nearer and nearer his mouth and he starts videotaping an alarmingly lengthy farewell to friends and family. And the whole time youre rooting for the water.

Share Tweet Into The Storm is an uncanny valley disaster movie--not as consciously cheesy and cheap as something like Sharknado 2 but built around a similar equation of unreality and gratification.A massive wedge tornado rips through an airport sweeping jets off the tarmac; they dance upright in the swirl to the sound of moaning bending metal. A narrow twister tears into a gas spill producing an Old Testament column of fire that spins up into the sky. Vortices converge in the center of a small town sucking up cars masonry and an oversized statue of a Holstein cow. None of this seems real in either the visual or the narrative sense; the effects--oncoming storm fronts roping tornadoes thick bolts of lighting--have a glossy artificial texture and they seem to occupy a different spatial plane than the actors.All of this plastic destruction is framed through a found-footage gimmick which registers as equally unreal; a viewer never gets the impression that any of the movies cameras are being operated by the characters or that the footage is being produced by prosumer camcorders. It is crisp competently and sometimes effectively framed with almost no shake and pans and zooms that are timed to action. In other words it looks like a movie which is more than can be said for plenty of recent films that dont frame themselves as amateur footage.In the film a freak tornado outbreak hits fictional Shaw County sending high-school Vice Principal Gary (Richard Armitage) on a mission to rescue his eldest son Donnie (Max Deacon) with the help of a group of storm-chasers led by brittle old pro Pete (Matt Walsh for some reason). Though the only discernible function of this thin plot is to connect one set-piece to another screenwriter John Swetnam--who also wrote this weeks Step Up All In--nonetheless insists on giving every character a capital-B Backstory. Gary is a widower Donnie makes speeches about his moms death team meteorologist Allison (Sarah Wayne Callies) is a single mom who misses her daughter and so on and so forth. These paint-by-numbers characterizations serve only to pad out the running time; if the protagonists were swapped out for another group of people Into The Storm would remain more or less unchanged the only differences being cosmetic.As in his debut feature Final Destination 5 director Steven Quale seems to be going out of his way to keep audience identification to a minimum; the less the characters seem like people the easier it is to enjoy watching them cower and flee. The result is a non-visceral disaster flick which wants its viewers to appreciate the scale of the destruction without ever thinking about danger. Its a shrewd cynical design move and one that occasionally pays off. Though Into The Storm lacks the earlier films twisted sense of suspense it manages to pull out a handful of sequences--like the aforementioned airport scene--that take perverse glee in ripping digital landscapes apart. Sometimes ""fake"" can be its own kind of fun.
