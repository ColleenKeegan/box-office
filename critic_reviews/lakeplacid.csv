Starring Bridget Fonda Bill Pullman and Oliver Platt. Directed by Steve Miner. (R. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In ""Lake Placid"" a crocodile is eating everybody and the crocodile has a particularly nasty attitude -- probably the result of being a computer graphic. No matter how many people a computer graphic eats it never feels full. So it eats and keeps eating. Meal No. 1 A diver is walking along the bottom of a lake minding his own business ignoring the thunderous chords on the soundtrack that mean ""Get out of the water"" Theres a roar. There are screams. There is thrashing -- followed by a shot of the fellow being pulled onto a rowboat only theres nothing left of him from the chest down. He has an expression on his face -- a poignant one actually. It seems to say ""Oh I get it. Im dinner."" From there the dinner bell is sounded at regular intervals. The crocodile in ""Lake Placid"" which opens today is 30 feet long and has a penchant for eating everyone but movie stars. Guessing the victims in this movie is as easy as guessing the victims on an old ""Star Trek"" episode. Thats good because the one person the audience absolutely positively does not want to see devoured is Bridget Fonda who plays a whiny spoiled-brat airheaded paleontologist. Fondas performance is so awful that she achieves a kind of perfection here -- a platonic ideal of bad acting. When Fonda looks into the camera lips quivering and says ""His head was just . . . bitten off"" she doesnt make the viewer believe that she has witnessed a horrible death. But Fonda brings the audience into the moment in other ways making us keenly aware of an actress utterly lost trying hard to look moved but wondering what she did so wrong to end up in this movie. The story is set in Maine where a crocodile seems to have migrated from Asia. We never find out why. Maybe he needed the exercise. Bill Pullman plays a federal officer sent to destroy the menace from the deep and Oliver Platt shows up as an eccentric millionaire who follows crocodiles all over the globe. Only in the movies. Platt has the best lines in David E. Kelleys script. Otherwise much of the repartee in ""Lake Placid"" is lame or out-and-out embarrassing. Betty White as a crazy widow who likes to feed the crocodiles plays one of the current cinemas most irritating gimmick characters an old lady who shocks everybody with gutter language. Director Steve Miner (""Warlock"" ""Friday the 13th Parts II and III"") has one directorial trick and hes not above carting it out every five minutes. He gets everything quiet. He makes everything calm. And then boom the soundtrack crashes and out comes Mr. Teeth. In one scene a huge grizzly bear roars into the action ready to devour the cast. But look out theres the crocodile coming out of nowhere to snap up the bear. Since computer graphics are not so advanced as to simulate a bear being eaten by a crocodile the crocodile simply inhales the bear. It saves time. The strange thing is that for all of Fondas whining Pullmans wary squinting and muttering the bad dialogue the cheesy effects the severed toes the severed heads the severed bodies and the cliched directorial choices ""Lake Placid"" adds up to a halfway enjoyable time at the movies. Sometimes quality isnt important. There can be something comforting in the predictably mediocre.

Lake Placid Movie Review amp; Film Summary (1999) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/lake-placid-1999,200,lakeplacid8,lakeplacid,rogerebert
"Lake Placid (R) Related Item ""Lake Placid"" showtimes A Crock of a Crocodile Movie By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 16 1999 Brendan Gleeson misses his mark. The same can be said of the entire ""Lake Placid"" movie. (20th Century Fox) Director Steve Miner Cast Bridget Fonda; Bill Pullman; Oliver Platt; Brendan Gleeson; Betty White; Meredith Salenger; Mariska Hargitay Running Time 1 hour 23 minutes Contains obscenity and a party platter of game wardens sheriffs deputies and wildlife turned into chum ""Lake Placid"" is ""Jaws"" lite. Its ""Anaconda"" set in the bucolic splendor of the Maine woods with a 30-foot crocodile terrorizing the populace instead of a giant tropical snake. Its laughably stupid only fitfully scary and relatively harmless summer fun - if youre 12 years old in which case you probably arent supposed to be going to movies like this anyway. Im not exactly sure who ""Lake Placids"" target audience is. In the first five minutes a diver investigating beaver dams in Black Lake Maine (no not New York state despite the movies title) gets vividly chomped in half closely followed by a shot of his legless and lifeless upper body stump lying in the morgue. Mind you Im not complaining. As director Steve Miner (""Halloween H20"") knows only too well thats exactly the kind of cool visual one expects - nay demands - from movies of this ilk and it comes along not a moment too soon. But at 83 minutes this short-attention-span cinema seems more geared to the braces and training bra set than to those who actually pay for tickets with their own money and have drivers licenses. For crying out loud ""Paulie"" ""Madeleine"" and ""Air Bud Golden Receiver"" ran longer than this In all likelihood though its probably not the violence that earned ""Lake Placid"" its R rating. Sure in addition to the aforementioned attack some guys head does get bitten off by the hungry reptile and a cow also gets swallowed whole but thats nothing you cant see on Fox or the Discovery Channel. Theres no sex or nudity to speak of as croc-hunting game warden Jack Wells (Bill Pullman) and fish-out-of-water city slicker Kelly Scott (Bridget Fonda) barely even swap spit. The real reason for ""Lake Placids"" R rating has got to be Betty White who plays backwoods farmers wife Delores Bickerman and swears like a longshoreman no make that Eric Cartman. She has a filthier mouth than the rotund antihero of the new ""South Park"" film and her sweetly dithery characters obscenity-spewing mouth is the best and funniest thing about the film. Lets see What are some of the worst things about this movie? Um the plot for one. Whats a crocodile doing in Maine? ""The big ones have been migrating north and this lake does connect to the ocean"" blithely explains billionaire mythology professor Hector Cyr (Oliver Platt) who travels the globe in his private helicopter for the primal thrill of swimming with man eaters. So just how does it survive the icy Maine winters? ""As long as its nostrils dont freeze "" offers the helpful Cyr. Which brings me to the dialogue lamely written by the overrated David E. Kelley of ""Ally McBeal"" and ""The Practice"" fame. Exactly what is dinosaur-bone expert Fonda doing in the field researching a living breathing creature in the first place? ""Youre a paleontologist"" says her boss (Adam Arkin). ""Thats what we do."" Oh. I was never quite sure what she is so afraid of either. What would a crocodile want with her bony behind anyway when hes got the pudgy Platt and Brendan Gleeson (playing sheriff Hank Keough) to chew on? Early on Cyr pokes fun at Keoughs weight which if you dont mind my saying so is a bit like the pot calling the kettle er fat. But why the wee beastie is still hungry is beyond me after downing one bear one cow one moose and half a man in the space of about two days. But never mind. If ""Lake Placid"" were worth its salt I wouldnt have had time to even think about all this nonsense. At least I know now to cross Maine off my list of potential vacation spots.

Kelley; MPAA Rating R Posted July 16 1999 -- 1200 AM EDT Theres a special look that actors get - avid yet resigned - when the movie theyre starring in is so bad it practically billboards their stalled careers. Bill Pullman and Bridget Fonda wear this expression throughout Lake Placid. Its a look that says ""We know were just meat."" A huge pesky crocodile has journeyed from Asia to a lake nestled in the woodsy hills of Maine. In the opening minutes were treated to a gross-out appetizer as the croc bites a wet-suited game officer in two and his wriggling torso gets pulled out of the water. Look Ma no legs After that the isolated setting lends ""Lake Placid"" a peculiar lack of urgency even on its own cheesy cardboard can-we-still-pick-the-bones-of-""Jaws"" terms. I mean if the crocodile is just sitting there with no one to bother but the crazy lady (Betty White cussing like a longshoreman) who feeds it the occasional cow theres a decent case to be made for just ... letting it be. ""Lake Placid"" was written by ""Ally McBeal"" creator David E. Kelley (is this how he moonlights?) and its director Steve Miner (""Halloween H20"") seems to have forgotten what little he ever knew about crafting mechanical jolts. Instead of rooting for Pullman and Fonda we end up praying that the crocodile is hungry enough to put them out of their misery.

Kelley goes fishing in feature film waters with ""Lake Placid"" and comes back with nothing for supper. A project for which the term writeoff was invented this lamer-than-lame attempt at stirring up the summer movie scene with a scary creature-in-the-depths scenario is sure to be gobbled alive by the ferocious competition. TV maestro David E. Kelley goes fishing in feature film waters with ""Lake Placid"" and comes back with nothing for supper. A project for which the term writeoff was invented this lamer-than-lame attempt at stirring up the summer movie scene with a scary creature-in-the-depths scenario will do nothing to harm the careers of those involved but it certainly will not help. Sure to be gobbled alive by the ferocious competition ""Lake Placid"" will sink without a trace and pose no threat to that other upcoming ""Jaws"" wannabe ""Deep Blue Sea."" Kelleys legion of TV fans may find his new pic more tolerable when it hits the small screen where the curiously brief running time ludicrous premise and slim thrills will pose less of a problem. The ultra-abbreviated nature of pic suggests major post-production problems; first tip-off is an early uncredited appearance by Adam Arkin longtime regular on Kelleys ""Chicago Hope"" series who comes and goes so fast as to barely register. More serious by far however is the absence of a genuine third act containing the kind of roller-coaster thrills that this genre demands and that would be expected from vet horror helmer Steve Miner. To be sure Kelleys Emmy-winning brand of off-kilter humor and cockeyed affection for rural folk is on display but his attempt here to blend the citified angst of ""Ally McBeal"" (co-star Bridget Fonda was Kelleys first choice as that series lead) with the countrified absurdisms of ""Picket Fences"" plus bits out of the Peter Benchley playbook doesnt hold water. The mayhem starts promptly on a glassy lake in northern Maine (which the locals insist on calling Lake Placid even though that moniker has already been taken by the more famous New York ski spot) as Sheriff Hank Keough (Brendan Gleeson) trolls for a mysterious underwater creature with a Fish amp; Game diver whose incessant wisecracks are naturally rewarded by his being chomped in half. Boston paleontologist Kelly Scott (Fonda) is having a hard time getting over the fact that b.f. Arkin is dumping her when he dumps something else in her lap She is to go to the lake to study a tooth extracted from the divers torso. Suspecting that shes being pushed out of the way for new lovers Fonda goes anyway though she despises the outdoors camping and dumb rural guys in particular; she also suspiciously displays a near-perfect facsimile of Ally McBeal-like neuroses. One rural guy who isnt dumb is Fish amp; Game studmuffin Jack Wells (Bill Pullman) who is essentially Tom Skerritts sheriff hero in ""Picket Fences"" transplanted to the Northeast. Once Kelly examines the tooth and finds it to be ""ancient"" and much like that of a crocodile her job is done. But she wants to stay on ""because I want to be a part of this."" ""This"" is hunting down the croc or whatever is out there but matters -- and the movie -- zoom quickly out of control with the arrival by private copter of eccentric millionaire and croc aficionado Hector Cyr (Oliver Platt). Soon Jack is having to contend not only with Kellys whining the endlessly unfunny spatting between Hector and Sheriff Hank and the nutty widow who lives on the lake but with a fresh wave of attacks by the creature which turns out to be a 30-foot crocodile that has managed to swim all the way from its warm natural habitat in Asia. Hector and Kelly want the mega-amphibian captured while Jack and Sheriff Hank want to fire away and this standard conflict is given perfunctory treatment. In the pics one startling action scene the big croc gulps down a hulking grizzly but all too quickly for an actioner the beast is soon captured. A coda involving a widow (Betty White) and her over-affection for the crocodiles does nothing to give ""Lake Placid"" anything like a satisfying conclusion and no amount of self-conscious eccentricity or joking around can make up for it. Whatever attracted fine actors Pullman Fonda Gleeson and Platt to the script is now gone as they all search desperately for their characters. Pullman is all jaw and smile here employing little of his natural irony while barely concealing his actors puzzlement at the plots gaping holes. Fonda fares the worst with an irritating role that embodies all the pics problems. Gleeson could well be wondering if this vacant silly assignment is his reward for his epochal work in last years ""The General."" Not for the first time Platts clownish mannerisms get the better of him in exchanges that hopelessly ape the funny scenes in ""Jaws"" involving Richard Dreyfuss. Pics widescreen look and d.p. Daryn Okadas facility with both big landscapes and churning underwater action as well as John Ottmans serious-minded score belie the throwaway nature of the material. Refraining from endowing his creatures with fanciful or humanoid qualities f/x whiz Stan Winston delivers anatomically correct crocs whose realism still doesnt make us buy that theyd ever get to Maine.
