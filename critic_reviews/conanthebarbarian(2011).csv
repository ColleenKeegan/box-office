But even with low expectations this CG-heavy take on John Miliuss beloved 1982  sword n sorcery classic comes across as a half-hearted affair. Jettisoning everything that made the original work - the knowing stoner humour the sprawling narrative canvas the spit-and-sawdust special effects Basil Poledouriss magnificent score and of course the Austrian Oak himself - this is a standalone story not worthy of the Conan brand.To be fair it starts reasonably well as Conan is born on the battlefield ripped from his dying mothers womb by strapping dad Ron Perlman who seems to be under contract to appear in every beards n broadswords fantasy going. For the next half hour its unambitious but enjoyable as Conan grows to manhood (and turns into rippling Game of Thrones star Jason Momoa) decapitates a few chumps and makes some powerful enemies including power-crazed warlock Khalar Zim (Stephen Lang) and his preening proto-goth daughter Marique (Rose McGowan).All of which is serviceable enough. But somewhere in the middle it starts to unravel battles kick off for no reason other than its been a while since the last one Conan hooks up with forgettable love interest Tamara (Rachel Nichols) and the plot becomes repetitive  - poor Tamara gets chased around by the baddies about four times. Momoa is a charisma-neutral hunk of beef in the lead role and only McGowan who comes on like a cross between Shirley Manson and Freddy?Krueger appears to be having any fun. The result is sporadically enjoyable - director Marcus Nispel has a way with a nifty action set-piece when the overbearing SFX arent getting in the way - but mostly pointless. Rent the original instead.

The film is tough going and the plot and acting are pure wood. There is gratuitous heads cutting off and gore especially for the 3d but you never quite warm to either of the male or femaile leads. Not dire but not that good.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreAug 25 2011iLovefilmsFeaturedI saw this on opening night in 3D. Enjoyed it amp; I think three stars would be a fair score. After seeing the two lead females in the trailer I expected allot worse from this film; but it was entertaining throughout with a heavy dose of bloody action. The direction was decent amp; the action set pieces were all handled well. Yet while watching I couldnt help but think what the film could have been if it was directed/developed by Michael J. Basset who made the far superior ""Solomon Kane"" - Which was another Robert E. Howard creation. Now down to the 3D aspect. With silly/fun films like this I usually feel like Im missing out on something if I watch the 2D version. It did have a couple sections which used the affect well amp; this added a clear HD depth to the image. This was the first post conversion 3D movie I had seen as mostly they are filmed in 3D but overall I didnt find anything to complain about. Some parts looked flat some parts had depth. In all honesty though you really wont be missing out on much if you decide to catch the 2D version as the 3D was ok but compared to a 100% 3D movie this was around 65%. Overall it was a good film amp; Jason Momoa played the role of Conan convincingly. Recommenced if you enjoy sword type films that are purely meant for entertainment purposes. One of the better ""Summer"" movies this year.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreAug 25 2011kerryFeatured...agree totally. I have a high tolerance for this sort of movie and will see anything in the genre regardless of the reviews but this was tough going. The fight scenes were the highlight of the film for me - and theres entertainment value there ... just not APS9 worth. Some of the dialogue is truly awful - and not in a good-awful way - but in a couldnt-you-have-just-tried-a-smidge-harder way. One scene has a boat being stalked and boarded by another boat in the dark then abruptly jumps to dawn/daylight fighting on the decks. Such a waste of a classic pulp character.

"Conan the Barbarian | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; conan-the-barbarian_2339 ) Conan the Barbarian (United States 2011) August 19 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli The popularity of Conan the Barbarian peaked during the early 1980s with no fewer than three monthly comic books to go along with the books and the first Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. The success of the 1982 film begot a horrible sequel Conan the Destroyer. A third movie ended up in development hell and attempts to resurrect the franchise were curtailed when Schwarzenegger exited acting for politics. Now after years in limbo Conan has finally been rebooted; the result is about what one might expect from a B-grade production team. The 2011 version of Conan the Barbarian looks cheap and feels rushed. The few good elements are dwarfed by a generic nonsensical plot and shoddy storytelling. The 1982 Conan meshed original narrative elements with bits and pieces of established lore to create an epic tale of swords sorcery and general mayhem. The world of Hyboria is realized in painstaking detail making it as real a land as Middle Earth in Peter Jacksons The Lord of the Rings. Sadly this ""re-imagination"" which features an alternative telling of Conans origins retains little of Howard opting instead to make Conan a generic barbarian superhero. Viewers are presented with glimpses of CGI-rendered ancient cities but they rarely come to life as more than pretty pictures appropriate for pages of a calendar. Conans world remains fragmented and half-formed. And theres nothing remotely epic about this story even if Morgan Freemans opening narration would have us believe otherwise. One instance of success lies in the casting of Jason Momoa in the title role. Bearing a striking resemblance to a Frank Frazetta painting Momoa is arguably a better choice than Schwarzenegger ever was and he is able to deliver dialogue more convincingly (not that Conan has a lot to say). Momoa who essayed Khal Drogo in the first season of George R.R. Martins Game of Thrones appears to have the market cornered on playing barbarians of few words. Its doubtful that his portrayal of Conan will do for his career what Schwarzeneggers did in the 80s. Conans popularity isnt what it once was and the movie is unlikely to make a significant impact on the late summer box office before heading to home video. The story has the same basic structure as its 1982 predecessor although it is not a remake Conan whose father is killed by an evil warlord while he watches grows up to seek revenge. Curiously although this basic idea has now fueled two major motion picture it was never an element of Howards Conan. Faithfulness to ""canon"" whatever that might be in the case of a franchise that has had so many different aspects is not of interest to director Marcus Nispel or his screenwriters whose familiarity with the main character appears to be from the 2007 action video game (a God of War knockoff in which the player manipulates Conan). The action set to depressingly uninspired music by Tyler Bates that makes one yearn with painful desperation for Basil Poledouris classic score starts out in wintery Cimmeria where Conan (played as youth by Leo Howard) is learning the way of the sword from his father Corin (Ron Perlman). His lessons are cut short by the arrival of the warlord Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang) and his band of riders. They are seeking the missing piece of an artifact. Its hidden somewhere in the Cimmerian village and once they find it they kill everyone except Conan. The action fast-forwards some fifteen years. Khalar Zym and his daughter Marique (Rose McGowan) are now searching for a ""pure blooded"" woman (Rachel Nichols) whose sacrifice used in conjunction with the artifact will resurrect a dead sorceress and give Khalar Zym great power. Conan seeking vengeance is hunting them. The initial encounter does not go well but Conan emerges with an unexpected prize the woman Khalar Zym needs is his captive. The action sequences are adequately choreographed although the camerawork is a little too frenetic for optimum 3-D rendering. The violence is extreme but in a campy cartoonish fashion. Theres some sex and nudity as well but thats all window dressing. No camels are punched however. In fact I dont think there are any camels in the movie. The screenplay is where Conan the Barbarian stumbles its most mightily. For a movie of this sort to work it needs scope but theres nothing here for the viewer to latch onto. The characters are lifeless types. Theres no emotion or passion. Conans father dies in front of his eyes yet we feel nothing. For all its faults the 1982 Conan the Barbarian was operatic in the way it played with emotions - from the butchering of Conans village to the death of Valeria to the final confrontation with Thulsa Doom. Here were watching mostly second rate actors going through the motions with a paint-by-numbers script designed primarily to keep special effects technicians employed. Robert E. Howard was a pulp writer; even he would have scorned this kind of shoddy treatment. To give the devil his due the postproduction 3-D conversion in Conan the Barbarian is among the best I can recollect. It doesnt add a lot but neither will it make the average viewer want to gouge his eyes out rather than continue watching. Whether its worth an extra 3 is another matter especially considering that Conan the Barbarian isnt worth the price of a regular admission let alone one with a surcharge. Still the real problem lies not in the 3-D but in the sloppy handling and ignorance of the filmmakers in resurrecting one of the titans of Swords amp; Sorcery.

Is Conan a boy born as his mom died in battle doomed to a life of violence and grunts? The answer (spoiler alert) is yes a fact the film continually points out. ""Lookit"" the movie says clearly frustrated with you for not getting it ""this little fella Conan was brought into this world as his momma passed away from a rather large stab wound. Where do you see this guys life headed?"" And so yes NATURE is the clear winner Conans ""nurturing"" phase is spent killing grown warrior men as a teen. Not so different from life cycle of your average  Wire character when you think about it though the mind wonders at the possibilities. If hed been born in the water would he now be Conan the Dolphin? Would being born near a pizza oven have made him Conan the Mozzarella Maestro? Could we start birthing babies on a trampoline to up the level of our gymnastic programs? But no these flights of fancy are not to be because Conan was born on a battlefield born of blood. Hes a bad man he was a bad teen and when his poppa held him up on the battlefield punctuated with a roar one can assume he was a bad newborn. I dont know what he was before he was born in his mothers womb as she wielded a sword fighting off adversaries. He might have been more introspective at that point this pre-blood birthing. Conan the Pensive? Ron Perlman (Hellboy) is Conans dad. Hes got plenty in the way of life lessons to teach young Conan but unfortunately he only gets around to one before Conans village is invaded by jerks. The lesson is this a sword is forged by both fire AND ice. Thats the mystery of steel and Conan needs to get that through his thick skull before he can progress to be a fully realized Conan. According to dad Conans problem is that hes too much fire hes all attack and no savvy hes all ""hit em up"" and no ""Hey my name is Conan hows it going?"" Luckily for us the audience this fire vs. ice life lesson will basically never be mentioned again. So far as I can tell Conans fiery ways continue unabated and serve him fairly well especially if you consider the body count he racks up without even bothering to wear a shirt. And oh the battles. This is one extended battle the ""plot"" jumping around from place to place only as a vehicle to provide a new backdrop for further sword play.  Morgan Freeman narrates and you know youre in a new locale when the words come on the screen to tell you so. How did you get there? Why are we somewhere new? Dont concentrate on such trivialities theres death to behold Impaling head crushing nose chopping arrows to the dome all the hits all the classics played over and over each punch massively amplified so that it sounds like a 67 Chevy hitting a brick wall. This Conan guy is a HELLUVA fighter but hes not so big on the talkie. Even less is said than in Arnolds original version and seeing Jason Momoas take on this ""remade"" Conan made me think how much I enjoyed his work in Game of Thrones. Still there are bad guys or really just the one main bad guy (Stephen Lang) who has a bad witch-daughter (Rose McGowan). The bad people want to raise their wife/mom from the dead but to do that they need to gather all the pieces to a magical mask AND find a pureblood lady as laid forth in the ""Necromancy for Dummies"" handbook. Where Conan comes into conflict with the bad people is that his father has the final piece of the mask ... and he becomes sweet on the pureblood girl. Revenge Protect the pure lady These themes run throughout Conan the Barbarian sometimes at odds generally simplistic and often allowing Conan to grunt in a non-committal manner. So far as the bad guy and witch-daughter go youre probably out there thinking ""Yes but is incest at ALL hinted at? I mean when trying to revive mom from the dead isnt that just GOING to come up?"" Indeed Conan the Barbarian doesnt disappoint on this front we the audience are left to consider whether it wouldnt just be more efficient to sign off on a father-daughter union instead of following all the necessary steps to bring mom back to life. Thankfully a definitive answer is given though I wont spoil that for you. What I am going to go ahead and spoil is the dialogue. Partly because its amazingly terrible and I dont want you to have to pay to see the movie to be able to quote it to your friends. Here are a few of the nuggets of genius contained within Conan the Barbarian ""This is something I must do alone."" ""I live I love I slay ... and I am content."" ""Not bad."" (as grudging respect for a GIRL fighting) ""They all tell me their secrets."" (Guy about to torture another guy) What a nightmare. And what the hell happened to Mongol General Conan What is best in life? Conan To crush your enemies see them driven before you and to hear the lamentation of their women. Now thats dialogue Its really something when you cant match the 1982 version of Conan for story complexity and cleverness but here we are. Conan the Barbarian features decent action but its action completely lacking in context. The plot has no real logic and none of the actors seem to be on the same page. Where McGowan overplays everything Momoa is so minimalist as to almost be invisible. Not ideal. Buried deep beneath the muscles and mayhem there might have been a decent Conan film in there somewhere but this particular take on the character never even gets started. Still lets hope this isnt the end ... its always nice to think of Conan out there swinging away.

"Conan the Barbarian review Wreaking havoc and speaking in monosyllables |       NJ.com comments Conan the Barbarian review Wreaking havoc and speaking in monosyllables Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on August 19 2011 at 719 AM View/Post Comments Simon VarsanoJason Momoa fills in for Arnold Schwarzenegger in the new ""Conan the Barbarian."" It was a time when the sandy wastes were littered with the spent flagons of drunkards and the scattered gowns of harlots and honest citizens locked tight their doors at night. But we are not here to speak of ""Jersey Shore."" No let us go back to a time nearly as mindless as our own the Hyborian Age -- found not in any history but celebrated forever by the High Priests of Geek who worship the warrior known as Conan. And you ask was this the same Conan who lost the midnight battle against the Chin of Death wounded Lopez the Mirthless and even still languishes unseen in the dungeons of basic cable? And I say unto you Nay. For todays saga is that of Conan the Barbarian who came from the land of Cimmeria where men were manly men even though they wore charming furs and oft had the hair of women and comparable chests. And their land was a paradise were paradise made of dung. But then a villain came in search of a magic talisman and laid waste to their village and slaughtered all but the boy Conan. And years pass before us in our tale and Conan now appears in the guise of Jason Momoa who has arms like Ionic columns or perhaps Doric for I could never recall the difference. And he has one expression which is to lower his chin and look up slyly like Lauren Bacall. And -- upon my honor -- he be nearly as fearsome though The Great Ahnuld would remonstrate could he pronounce that word. So Conan now wanders the land in pursuit of this villain who is played by the great Stephen Lang and the villains daughter who is played by the oddly bewitched Rose McGowan and the smell of ham is thick but not unpleasant. But then Conan finds a comely female. And so he kidnaps the wench and ties her up and gags her for the courting rituals of Cimmeria are beyond the pale and even beyond Charlie Sheen. But then the female warms to him and they retire to a cave to make the beast of flattering lighting. Has Conan found perhaps another paradise? ""I know not and I care not"" he muses. ""I live. I love. I slay. I am content."" And verily who among us can say he has not often uttered the same But then Lang reappears and McGowan who has the sharp and lethal nails of a real housewife. And the battle must be joined and several hundred effects artists earn their pay. And does it satisfy this tale? In its own modest way it does. True the sword fights are but blurs and noise. And the narration which is by Morgan the Freeman oddly makes one think of wintry nature films and that prison picture that is forever on AMC. But the landscapes are striking. The violence is stirring. And the sorcery -- although it makes little use of its 3-D magic -- includes many marvelous sand demons and a giant octopus and other pleasures that recall the days of Ray of Harryhausen. And if this film is sometimes a feeble joke and other times a great steaming slab of Cimmerian cheese? There are many who know not and will care not. It is loud. It is colorful. It makes things blow up. They will be content. Ratings note The film contains much wenching and swordplay. Conan the Barbarian (R) Lionsgate (112 min.) Directed by Marcus Nispel. With Jason Momoa Stephen Lang Rose McGowan. Now playing in New Jersey.

Movies | By    Jordan Riefe on August 18 2011  923 am Follow aduralde Email Print This reboot of the Arnold Schwarzenegger hit is swords sorcery and stupidity The original ""Conan the Barbarian"" was the breakout role for a young Arnold Schwarzenegger who fully embodied Robert E. Howards born-in-battle muscle-bound warrior bent on revenge. It was a cheesy little movie in the best way mindful of its pulp roots and the sword-and-sorcery matinees of yesteryear. The reboot stars Jason Momoa in what is mainly an exercise in adolescent machismo with a healthy dose of misogyny. In other words the new ""Conan the Barbarian"" like the scaly beasts that its hero battles is a dinosaur. Conan is born into conflict cut from the womb of his dying mother by his father Corin (Ron Perlman). Director Marcus Nispel performs a nifty bit of narrative as his camera lands in the womb with Conan the Fetus the muffled noise of battle all around. With the flash of a blade and a slash of daylight Conan and we are tossed into the world amid bloody combat. At his fathers side Conan grows to resemble a professional wrestler albeit one who has traded his stretchy pants for a red skirt. Witnessing the old mans death at the cruel hand of Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang) Conan vows vengeance. But Zym plans to kidnap Tamara (Rachel Nichols) the last pure-blood of the Sorcerers of Acheron. A spell requiring her blood mixed with a magic mask will make Zym a God reigning hellfire for eternity unless Conan can stop him. Although its rated R ""Conan the Barbarian"" is best suited to boys under the age of 17 whose knowledge of females is limited to what they can find on the internet. Women in the movie are either heartless witches or fawning instruments of pleasure. Real men are steeped in blood and psychopathically cut off from their emotions or as Conan succinctly puts it ""I live I love I slay and I am content."" Oh for simpler times. But how sexy is Jason Momoa? I dont know. Is torture sexy as when he cuts off the nose of a bad guy and later sticks his finger deep into the wound to get his cooperation? Handsome and muscle-bound Momoa moves like an athlete but his acting chops are as limited as his charisma. (If youre a fan of his work on the HBO hit ""Game of Thrones"" youll be stunned at how unengaging he is as Conan.) Lang makes an adequate if cliched villain -- hes a far more versatile actor with greater range than his recent bad-guy roles in ""Avatar"" and ""White Irish Drinkers"" would lead you to believe. To intimidate the 64"" Momoa Lang ratchets up his performance but in a world where brutality rules the day he reads a little old and feeble. Zyms cruelty is certainly inventive (he traps and kills Conans father in a way that implicates his victims son) and his repertoire of magic includes raising indomitable shape-shifting warriors from the earth. But sooner or later Conan and Zym will have to go mano-a-mano and craggy as he is Lang looks like an old fart next to Momoa. Rose McGowan looks like shes having a ball as Zyms sorceress daughter Marique who dresses in bizarre outfits shaves her eyebrows and is pasted in exotic henna tattoos. She means to replace the memory of her deceased mother in her fathers affections -- yes theres a hint of taboo behind all those tattoos but ""Conan the Barbarian"" never commits to being that kind of movie. Director Nispel who graduated from commercials to phoned-in reboots like ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Friday the 13th"" keeps the action moving in technically proficient but unimaginative fashion. Shot in Bulgaria and employing cheap off-shore digital effects and unimpressive post-production 3-D processing this new movie has the same cut-rate feel of the original. But back in 1982 ""Conan"" was supposed to look cheap. These days pulp material gets A-list budgets and stars and audiences expect movies like ""Conan the Barbarian"" to look great. It doesnt. The new movie has its moments and easily pleased die-hards will probably love it but ""Conan the Barbarian"" feels a bit like a money grab latching onto an old property and lazily exploiting it rather than celebrating what made the material such fun in the first place.

(Simon Varsano) Joe Neumaier Friday August 19 2011 400 AM Title Conan the Barbarian With Jason Momoa Rose McGowan. A brutal warrior avenges his fathers death. Director Marcus Nispel (158). R Violence sexuality. At area theaters.With the most growling and grunting of any movie this summer -- and that includes those apes perched atop the box office -- ""Conan the Barbarian"" seems at times to have actually been made by barbarians.They even threw in characters with strange-looking foreheads even stranger-looking beards and one noseless guy.But then Morgan Freeman narrates about ""a mask made from the bones of kings"" and a villain bellows ""Behold"" before a dull fight on a bridge and you realize this isnt classic barbarian. Its just another ham-handed adventure flick in eye-deadening wallet-draining 3-D.One problem is that Conan himself -- embodied by Arnold Schwarzenegger in the 1980s via Robert E. Howards pulp 1930s stories and a lesser-known 70s Marvel comic -- isnt that interesting.So the filmmakers provide us with his birth on a battlefield (once more unto the breech?) and sullen prepubescence. It turns out young Conan had father issues and since his dad is played by professional early hominid Ron Perlman can you blame him?As an adult barbarian fated to bring together ""the nations of Hyboria"" Conan (Jason Momoa) declares that he lives he loves and he slays doing two of those in a soft-core-porny way. The slaying is due to his hunt for Khalar Zym (""Avatars"" Stephen Lang) the warlord who killed Conans dad and seeks that mask Morgan Freeman was talking about.With the mask and the ritual sacrifice of a ""pureblood"" (played by purely bad Rachel Nichols) Zyms mystic daughter (trash-film addict Rose McGowan) can help dad rule the pre-historic/post-Atlantis world. That is unless Conan has any growl in the matter.Director Marcus Nispel is responsible for rejuvenating the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Friday the 13th"" titles but here he should have had his army of screenwriters come up with better monsters.Squid tentacles emerge from a drain but those well suck. And sand warriors are never a good idea because sure enough they crumble when you hit them.What this movie needed was a dash of ""Jason and the Argonauts.""Instead its the hirsute big brother to ""Prince of Persia.""The Schwarzenegger movies from 30 years ago looked like someone put a Stretch Armstrong doll inside a lava lamp so here Nispel tries for a grittier style. But that plus Momoas stony expressions and a moronic script only helps slay the fun from this overlong fantasy.As a barbarian might say ""Grrr"" Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Starring Jason Momoa Ron Perlman Director Marcus Nispel Running time 152 Release Opened Aug 19 2011  Editorial Review Sword sorcery without ArnoldBy John DeForeFriday Aug 19 2011German-born director Marcus Nispel whose remakes of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Friday the 13th"" were bigger hits than idea-starved studios should have hoped for rehashes another generation-old genre staple in ""Conan the Barbarian."" If indeed there has been a community of film buffs yearning for a ""Conan"" reboot they could hardly be hoping for a more appropriate slab of beef to play him than Jason Momoa - a Hawaiian with muscle tone to make Frank Frazetta weep and perpetually flared nostrils that one suspects can smell an enemys blood long before it spurts from severed arteries. Those nostrils do a lot of Momoas acting to be honest. As right as he is looks-wise Momoa falls short in attitude He speaks in one of those trying-too-hard baritones heard in young jocks whose greatest fear is being called gay. Combine his vocal delivery with the obligatory misogyny (""Woman I said come here"") and you come dangerously close to Fratboy the Bar-brawler-ian. Momoa is upstaged by Leo Howard the 14-year-old actor who plays Conan as a boy convincing us of the characters innate savagery as he single-handedly slays four marauders before his clan has even decided hes old enough for a sword. That clan is led by Conans father Corin (Ron Perlman) who is killed in front of the boy by would-be warlord Khalar Zym. (Perlman has often performed under heavy makeup but the dreadlock-carpet of a beard clinging to his face here may be his greatest acting challenge yet.) Zyms agenda is the usual sword-and-sorcery stuff Collect all the hidden pieces of an ancient mask find the ""pure blood"" damsel Tamara to sacrifice use his new magic powers to revive his wife (a witch who was burned alive) rule the world and try not to weep every time he sees what a freak-show his daughter - Rose McGowan laughably portraying a witch-in-training - has become. While Zym wreaks havoc across the land Conan grows mighty and seeks revenge. We meet him years later as he slays one fantastically ugly Zym henchman after another and finally catches up to his fathers killer. The plot really isnt worth discussing beyond that but it includes plenty of action scenes including a fun one in which magic sand-warriors explode from the ground to chase Conan through collapsing scaffolds. Nispel falls into familiar traps throughout the film framing battles too tightly to follow them incorrectly assuming we want an ""epic"" that runs nearly two hours and building to a climax that is ridiculously staged (Conan and Zym fight atop a wooden wheel as it falls toward a fiery pit) while insulting the heros strength by suggesting hed have a hard time pulling slender Tamara to safety. You can bet Arnold Schwarzenegger would never have stood for that last mistake.Contains sexuality and some nudity interspersed with enough gory violence to justify the movies title.

Photo AP Within the span of a week Rick Perry begins to run for president and the remake of ""Conan the Barbarian"" hits theaters. Coincidence? Or natural running mates? The original ""Conan"" was a sloppy grandiose unforgivable muckbath directed by the (I say the words lovingly) right-wing maniac John Milius. I watched it about four times to make sure it had no redeeming qualities. The reboot (re-sandal?) isnt good either exactly. But it has a certain commitment to its cause and by that I mean it supplies the necessary flayings slayings beheadings and um a be-nose-ing all of it dancing to the tune of those amusingly stilted He-Man declaratives -- King James Bible cadences applied to comic-book visions. It knows its a B movie and gets on with it. Conan 2.0 begins with nearly a half-hour of the story of lil Conan (Leo Howard) a boy born in battlefield carnage. As Mom falls Dad (Ron Perlman clad in what appears to be an entire yak) conducts a field-expedient C-section on Mom whose last glimpse is of her man-child. And Conan? ""His first taste was of his mothers blood."" As a man Conan (now played by Jason Momoa Khal Drogo in ""Game of Thrones"" whose Eddie Van Halen curls seem to glisten with detangling product) seeks vengeance on the evil lord Zym (Stephen Lang the ""Avatar"" villain). Zym joined by his witch daughter (an effectively creepy Rose McGowan looking like the child of Helena Bonham Carters Red Queen and her ex-boyfriend Marilyn Manson) will achieve ultimate power via a magic mask moistened with the pure blood of the descendant (Rachel Nichols) of the ancient sorcerers. Disappointingly her name is um Tamara. As for Conan his name is now pronounced like that of the ginger-haired talk-show host. Tamara the size of the average crossbow and the product of a literally cloistered upbringing effortlessly slays hardened professional warriors on all sides until captured by Conan who is a strict gentleman with her and also frees some slaves out of a distaste for injustice. This is the kind of movie in which a dying murder victim murmurs ""I love you son"" instead of screaming ""Avenge me"" Such liberal-arts-campus gesturing (the screenwriters attended Brown Vassar and Northwestern respectively) interferes with the flow. Conan is supposed to be a death-dealing Iron Age brute not Abraham Lincoln. I was starting to wonder when OSHA inspectors would turn up to issue citations for unsanitary dungeon management. And Momoa beefy as he is isnt really the right cut of meat for this part -- theres a little too much self-awareness glinting in his emerald irises. It would have been better to go with someone for whom speaking English does not come naturally. Like Arnold. Or Stallone. But Conan does keep things roaring using (for instance) a severed head as an ID card and slicing off a foes nose (then jamming his finger in the crater). Director Marcus Nispel (who also remade both ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Friday the 13th"") larks through piles of skeletons and frolics over bottomless pits of damnation. A couple of action scenes (such as a dull shipboard battle) are superfluous and choppy editing mars many of them. Also some nifty plot ideas -- such as cool dust monsters that the witch raises at will -- arent well thought out. If these monsters are so invincible why do the villains stop using them? Moreover the good characters are way too bland compared to the much more interesting dual evildoers. But deploying Morgan Freeman as the narrator is a witty touch (given that the original co-starred the previous godhead of narration James Earl Jones). And you cant underestimate the vitality of a movie where manly men give orders such as ""We will cast our rivals into oceans of blood."" Then there is this classic ""I live. I love. I slay. And I am content."" The presence of that line almost made me forgive the writers for omitting the classic motto of the original a remark that begged to be repeated with gusto in the remake. What is best in life? Why its ""to crush your enemies to see them driven before you and to hear the lamentations of their women.""

By Guy Roland Lionsgate Hes no Schwarzeneggar Jason Momoa has the titular role in the remake of Conan the Barbarian. EnlargeClose By Guy Roland Lionsgate Hes no Schwarzeneggar Jason Momoa has the titular role in the remake of Conan the Barbarian. What he doesnt do alas is act. This may not be the fault of Baywatch hunkster Jason Momoa who plays the title character in this ruinous remake of the 1982 Arnold Schwarzenegger sword-and-sandal flick. At least Arnolds ""acting"" helped to make it a corny home-video hit. VIDEO See the trailer But with a script so pat and humor-free Momoa has little to do but sneer and slice. The film informs us that Conan has the heart of a lion and ""the loyalty of a bloodhound"" but we get nary a sniff of that in this carnage fest. Hes built like a tank but Conan emotes like one too. The story such as it is has our hero not only avenging the death of his father (Ron Perlman) but hacking his way to villains Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang) and his daughter Marique (Rose McGowan) to prevent them from getting a hold of a mask that wields mystical power. Its one of multiple nods to Lord of the Rings and 300 though even with splatter-happy 3-D Conan cant approach either films visuals. Perlman gets too little screen time here to do anything meaningful and Avatars Lang is so one-dimensional its hard to believe they tried to film him in three. McGowans character flirts with hints of incest but that would be way too complicated for this film. The suggestion evaporates amid the deafening clatter leaving Marique will little more than good nails and a bad hairline. Conan the Barbarian  1/2 out of four Stars Jason Momoa Stephen Lang Rose McGowan Ron Perlman Director Marcus Nispel DistributorLionsgate Rating R for strong bloody violence some sexuality and nudity Running time 1 hour 52 minutes Opens Friday nationwide While the effects are fine -- did we really have explosions in 10000 B.C.? -- director Marcus Nispel who did the Friday the 13th and Texas Chainsaw Massacre remakes does little to replace the unintentional humor of the original memorable largely for Schwarzeneggers acting and enunciation. Unfortunately Momoa does not have that awkwardness and the effects are too slick to be satisfying. Which leaves us with a desultory tale. Conan may slay foes but he cant entertain to save his swarthy hide. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

Starring Jason Momoa Ron Perlman and Rose McGowan. Directed by Marcus Nispel. (R. 112 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) It takes a lot for a ""Conan the Barbarian"" movie to be flat-out idiotic when you consider how low the bar is set already. But this remake of the 1982 Arnold Schwarzenegger extravaganza flirts with absurdity from its opening seconds Morgan Freemans voice is heard as the narrator which is in itself the stuff of parody. Then we listen and get lost within two sentences because the narration is so poorly written that Freeman himself probably didnt know what he was talking about. Its downhill from there Cut to a fierce battle already in progress where a pregnant woman is fighting off marauding invaders even as she is going through labor. Suddenly her husband (Ron Perlman) arrives to help. How? He performs a one-stroke impromptu cesarean like a guy who has been doing cesareans all his life only on men. Then he holds the baby over his head and roars like Stallone. This is the birth of Conan folks. Have respect. Years later when Conan is about 14 he finds himself in a battle which director Marcus Nispel arranges in such a way that sometimes young Conan seems stuck behind enemy lines and sometimes hes with his own people. In fact theres really no sense of where Conan is just generalized commotion - in 3-D. But its in 3-D thats essential Take a bad movie in two dimensions film it in three and what do you get? Three entire dimensions of lousy. Related Stories Review Conan the Barbarian Conan remake truly a barbaric experience In any case the important thing is that Conan should enter manhood vowing to kill somebody and so there we are Fifteen minutes in Conan is now an adult played by Jason Momoa and he wants to kill the powerful king Khalar Zym who is played by Stephen Lang with such intensity that they probably didnt have the heart to tell him this is a bomb. Momoa is in great physical shape - give him credit for that - and he is more handsome than Schwarzenegger ever was. Yet he lacks that special quality that ""who is this guy"" thing that Arnold always had. By the way to criticize the acting in a movie like this is a little like blaming gravity on a guy who gets thrown out a window. The actors are victims too. But Rose McGowan really does deserve acknowledgment for one of the years worst performances as Marique an evil witch who goes around wearing long metal claws. Its a performance of gestures and attitude but ridiculous attitude as though it never dawned on her that Marique is not a modern girl from California. But then this movie does everything wrong. For example there are battle scenes in which nothing changes. Which means nothing happens. Which means they could have been cut but no. Later there is a whole sequence in a collapsing cave which becomes funny because the rocks keep raining down on the right people at the right time. Conan may not be loquacious but he is definitely one lucky guy. He is a philosopher too. In a tender moment he tells a young woman ""I live. I love. I slay and I am content."" Dont you love the way he slips in ""I slay"" as though no one is going to notice? But hey so long as hes happy. E-mail Mick LaSalle at mlasallesfchronicle.com.

Though the films lore tells us he was born on a battlefield in truth this Conan was born out of Hollywoods current joint lust for remakes and sword-and-sandals mythos. Simon Varsano/Lionsgate Films hide caption toggle caption Simon Varsano/Lionsgate Films Conan The Barbarian Director Marcus Nispel Genre Action Running Time 112 minutes Rated R for strong bloody violence some sexuality and nudity With Jason Momoa Rachel Nichols Stephen Lang Ron Perlman Rose McGowan ""What is best in life?"" ""To crush your enemies to see them driven before you and to hear the lamentations of the women."" Of the many florid exchanges in John Milius 1982 version of Conan the Barbarian thats the one most frequently quoted eternal fodder for third-rate Arnold Schwarzenegger impersonations. Scripted by Milius and Oliver Stone -- a team that suggests the prose equivalent of attaching a hammer to an anvil -- the film could fairly be labeled cheesy and overwrought but no one could accuse it of lacking purpose. Through Robert E. Howards fantasy stories Milius found in Conan the perfect vessel for his career-long obsessions with war power and the essence of masculinity. Cut to nearly two decades later and Conan returns just another property in need of a reboot shoehorned into a marketplace thats already overstuffed with barrel-chested warriors and murky 3-D fantasy realms. Directed by Marcus Nispel the music-video maestro responsible for similarly pointless remakes of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Friday the 13th the new Conan the Barbarian doesnt have a fresh take on the material -- or any take at all for that matter. There are swords and sorcery pirates and monsters taxed bodices and taxing mythology. In other words theres the bare minimum necessary to summon this dismal movie into existence. Via voice-over narration by Morgan Freeman -- who may at this point be available to narrate your morning commute -- we learn that Conan was literally born on the battlefield forged in blood and conflict much like a blade in fire and ice. After witnessing his father killed and his village razed as an impressionable boy the grown-up Conan played by Hawaiian beef slab Jason Momoa wanders in exile with sword in hand and revenge in his heart. His target Khalar Zym (Avatar baddie Stephen Lang) a sneering warlord intent on world domination. i Tamara (Rachel Nichols) Conans contractually obligated love interest breaks up the monotony of generic 3-D battle sequences with generic chemistry-free bedroom sequences. Simon Varsano/Lionsgate Films hide caption toggle caption Simon Varsano/Lionsgate Films Tamara (Rachel Nichols) Conans contractually obligated love interest breaks up the monotony of generic 3-D battle sequences with generic chemistry-free bedroom sequences. Simon Varsano/Lionsgate Films The byzantine plot involves Zym and his daughter Marique a devious witch played by goth icon Rose McGowan tracking down the pieces of a supernatural mask that will give Zym devastating power. Of course such a mask would be utterly ineffectual without first being activated by the purified blood of the ancients -- why any fool knows that -- and thats where Tamara (Rachel Nichols) Conans pedigreed love interest comes into play as the damsel in distress. With the battle lines drawn Nispel cuts back and forth between the Zyms terrorizing the kingdom with torture sadism and colorful bad-guy speeches and Conan and Tamara beating back the forces of darkness one minute while acting like romantic comedy characters the next. Not surprisingly evil wins out but mostly by default Lang and McGowan are appropriately hammy and vampy respectively but theyre mainly a relief from Momoa and Nichols whose soft-focus lovemaking scene really just consummates a relationship that belongs on Cinemax After Dark. The new Conan the Barbarian arrives at a time when sword-and-sandal fantasies are flourishing on film and television and the comparisons are hugely unflattering. From the lurid Starz series Spartacus Blood and Sand and HBOs richly imagined Game of Thrones to the visceral punch of movies like Centurion and Valhalla Rising theres a charisma to the lead performances and a complexity and passion to the filmmaking thats entirely absent here. Even the 3-D seems half-hearted At least 80 percent of the movie could be watched with the glasses off and the other 20 percent consists mainly of tumbling boulders and kicked-up dirt. Conan the Barbarian is the worst kind of failure the one where nobody shows up to play. Nispel and his collaborators dont try to mimic the Milius version but they dont bother re-conceiving it either save to neuter the robust machismo that was the earlier films lifeblood. They simply go through the expected paces for sword-and-sorcery adventures; if he wasnt called ""Conan"" he could go by any other name and no one would be the wiser.

Its busy without having energy a loud lackluster mess.Robert E. Howards enduring barbarian bad boy strode fully formed out of the mists of the pulp magazine scene of the 1930s with little back story but lots of swagger and swashbuckling. Conan the Barbarian borrows liberally from the origin put forth in the 1982 film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger in which Conan embarks on a quest for vengeance after his tribe the Cimmerians is killed and hes made a slave.This time around Conan is literally born on a battlefield in an awkward scene that plays like The Lion King by way of Highlander. Young Conan (Leo Howard) sees his village slaughtered and his sword-maker father (Ron Perlman) murdered by upwardly mobile warlord Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang). Zym is seeking the last piece of a magical mask that will allow him to resurrect his sorceress wife and -- you guessed it -- conquer the world.Flash-forward a decade or two to find Conan (Jason Momoa) roaming the ancient world as a thief pirate brigand and all-around party animal. He picks up Zyms trail in time to rescue a young priestess (Rachel Nichols) whose blood is the final ingredient needed for Zyms scheme while pursuing long-overdue vengeance.Theres really not much to the film beyond that. The bare-bones story has a repetitive aimless plot and woefully underdeveloped characters. Director Marcus Nispels style and production design are dishearteningly generic full of clumsy editing and secondhand set designs from a Peter Jackson yard sale.Nichols is given little to do but be pretty fight when there are enough bad guys to go around and serve as the requisite damsel in distress. Lang looks every inch the villain but he gets to do little more than scowl strut and growl lines about lakes of blood while Rose McGowan vamps it up as his witchy daughter with a Freddy Krueger manicure.Momoa (Game of Thrones) fares slightly better but hes equally hampered by the shoddy script. He captures Conans ferocity and cunning and expertly sells his one good line (""I live I love I slay and I am content"" cribbed from one of Howards original stories) but is left spinning his wheels in a monotonous movie. He and the Cimmerians deserve better.Conan the BarbarianD+ Starring Jason Momoa Rachel Nichols Stephen Lang Rose McGowan Ron Perlman and Said Taghmaoui. Directed by Marcus Nispel. 112 mins.

"Conan the Barbarian Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-DialogueMOVIE REVIEW So fun its barbaricThe squeamish should stay home but the bloodthirsty will thrill as Conan the Barbarian butchers bodies and dialogue.August 19 2011|Betsy Sharkey | FILM CRITIC ""Conan the Barbarian"" starring the excellent rippling chisel of Jason Momoa is brutal bloody beyond belief and has no socially redeeming value. So it is with a certain amount of guilt that I say its kind of a wicked blast to watch especially if youre in the mood for some righteous revenge.For those who decry gratuitous violence this is not a flick for you. For the rest of you bloodthirsty lot its not like the filmmakers were attempting a bait and switch. The movie is set in the fictional Hyborian Age roughly post-Atlantis and pre-Facebook by my calculations where monsters and sorcery were ever a threat and humans werent exactly civilized. Then theres Conans mantra ""I live. I love. I slay... I am content."" Who doesnt like a man who isnt conflicted or apologetic about who he is.Gory remakes of marginal quality are something of a specialty for German-born director Marcus Nispel who counts the 2003 redo of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and 2009s ""Friday the 13th"" among his artier achievements. Though its relative the director keeps getting better each time out. Nispel has always brought a very strong vision to his work -- a sort of melodrama of imagery that can be mesmerizing if you can get past the viscera. Character development? Not so much. For The Record Los Angeles Times Saturday August 20 2011 Home Edition Main News Part A Page 4 News Desk 1 inches; 46 words Type of Material Correction ""Conan the Barbarian"" The review of the movie ""Conan the Barbarian"" in the Aug. 19 Calendar section said that the contributions of cinematographer Thomas Kloss production designer Chris August and the various stunt coordinators cannot be underestimated. It should have said their contributions cannot be overestimated.In ""Conan"" hes got a better cast that he occasionally does better things with. Momoa is coming off a very fine run as the enigmatic horse-warrior Khal Drago in HBOs ""Game of Thrones."" Hes got Conan firmly in his muscly grip from the absurd asides to the furrowed brow to the fierce fighting though some of the clunkier dialogue trips him and everyone else up. Momoas also got that bigger-than-life presence that is absolutely necessary for this genre piece enough to loosen the iconic hold that Arnold Schwarzenegger has had on Conan since he flexed those famous pecs in the 1982 original.The movie itself does not attempt to replicate the Schwarzenegger version which had less violence and a splash more cheesy humor. Instead writers Thomas Dean Donnelly Joshua Oppenheimer and Sean Hood work off of Robert E. Howards Conan mythology (he started it all with his dark pulp series on Conan in the early 30s) to create a troubled ancient world of warring tribes vestal virgins lethal swords and Machiavellian monsters.After some setup voice-over to give a little historical context and introduce the Mask of Acheron which is the holy grail here we are in the midst of a bloody battle with the Cimmerians led by Conans father Corin (Ron Perlman rocking a Unabomber beard) lopping off heads left and right. Conans mother (Laila Rouass) is in the middle of the fray and labor delivering Conan by C-section which apparently wasnt as much a routine procedure as it is now.Flash-forward to a motherless Conan (oh come on anyone could figure that out) at about 13 played by very tough young martial arts expert Leo Howard who gets perhaps the best action sequence in the movie. Its one of those rite of passage things that always go bad and it involves a lot of running in rough terrain some wonderfully choreographed fighting and surviving. The fight scenes throughout are stunning to look at exceptionally gross exploit the 3-D technology in the best possible way and should satisfy hard-core action junkies though there are still way too many of them.The main villain is Stephen Lang (""Avatar"") as Khalar Zym. Lang has long had a handle on playing dark and dirty which Khalar definitely is. Hes ruthless when it comes to getting his hands on that magical Acheron mask. His partner in crime is daughter Marique -- Rose McGowan (""Grindhouse"" and ""Charmed"") as a kind of goth-punk witch whos always in a catfight with someone where her Edward Scissorhands metallic nails come in handy.Getting the mask (there are complications) is not enough; to make the black magic Khalar must also find the ""pureblood"" and that would be among the Grecian-styled beauties being trained in peace and love at a local monastery. Tamara (Rachel Nichols of ""Star Trek"" and ""G.I. Joe"") is the fairest of them all the one Conan must save and will fall for. Nichols is pretty enough but not believable as a tough chick who can go toe to toe with Conan. What was needed was a next generation Lara Croft in the Angelina Jolie style (scary fierce scary sexy) if there is such a person out there.The contributions of cinematographer Thomas Kloss who frequently collaborates with the director and especially production designer Chris August and the various stunt coordinators cannot be underestimated. From locations to sets ""Conan"" is drenched in detail that feels both ancient and mythic as Conan dogs the evil Khalar from mountain enclaves through dungeons into torture chambers and across seas. The rise of the sand soldiers is especially cool.So ""Conan the Barbarian"" is beastly and brutal; an unadulterated mess of English and American accents frequently butchering dialogue that is sometime witty sometime catty and sometimes just colossally awful.

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe Movies Conan the Barbarian Thats Sado-tainment This grimy gruesome revenge tale has a body count in the mid-trillions and plenty of things to make you go eww By Richard Corliss Aug. 18 2011 Share Read Later Simon Varsano / Lionsgate FilmsJason Momoa stars in a scene from Conan the Barbarian Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture In the sooty mists of time known as the Hyborian Age -- when fierce men did battle with stout swords and apparently certified their machismo by sporting heavy eyeliner -- there arose a hero named Conan determined to avenge the death of his father by killing practically everyone else. Actually Conan the Barbarian was born in 1932 sired by fantasy writer Robert E. Howard and given cinematic body if negligible soul by a pre-Terminator pre-Governator Arnold Schwarzenegger in a 1982 movie directed by John Milius and co-written by Oliver Stone. But men need myths and perpetual adolescents need to see the pulp stories they loved as kids exhumed every few decades. So heres Hawaiian-Irish hunk Jason Momoa in Conan the Barbarian a gaudily ornamented medieval banquet table groaning with junk food and open entrails. Tracking Conans journey from fetus (no kidding) to gruff manhood the new version finds its meager inspiration in the standard kill-dream of an orphans revenge. As a boy (played by Leo Howard) he watches in horror while the ruthless warlord Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang) humiliates and murders Conans father (Ron Perlman); its kind of like Saddam Husseins plot to assassinate George H.W. Bush which supposedly led son W. to invade Iraq and chase down Saddam. Conan though grows up to be less like 43 the smiling tiger and more like current Texas Governor Rick Perry with a compulsive appetite for red-meat rivalries. This barbarian has compiled an endless list of enemies and vows as Perry did with Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke to make life pretty ugly for all of them. King of the ugly prom is Khalar Zym leading an army of miscreants whose ragged gear and rude manners recall the bonkers bikers in Mad Max. Long in mourning over the early death of his wife Zym is convinced that reconstructing the legendary Mask of Acheron will revive her and grant him immortal rule over Hyboria. Anyway something like that; its Raiders of the Lost Arks old Ark of the Covenant shtick employed without shame or innovation in dozens of fantasy films. Zyms grown daughter Marique (Rose McGowan creepily seductive as always) has a corollary notion to use her own dark magic and become basically her fathers wife. Easily the coolest character in the movie Marique goes searching for Tamara (Rachel Nichols) the sacred virgin who holds the key to the Mask -- and who has become Conans beloved. When Marique examines other virgins and finds them ""impure"" she slices their skin with her 9-in. metal fingernails. The girls blood is her nectar. And bloodshed is this Conans plasma. German director Marcus Nispel a serial offender in grave-robbing old horror franchises (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Frankenstein Friday the 13th) obviously believes that if youre going to make an R-rated movie make a bleedin R pack it with sex and violence. The movie also has a few topless babes and a chaste scene of romantic consummation between Conan and Tamara but these are perfunctory inserted so the MPAA rating board could announce that the film has ""strong bloody violence some sexuality and nudity."" Actually nobody goes to movies for naked ladies anymore; they get that on their home computers for free. Conans real sales points are a body count in the mid-trillions and scenes of rapacity designed to force even the jaded male demographic to utter the ""eww"" noise of a little girl seeing a squashed toad. Once in a while the gore has a narrative point as when Conan infiltrates Khalar Zyms stronghold by holding the severed head of a Zym henchman up to the door slot. But the real money shots are more in the sadistic-stunt category Zym cracking one rivals skull into crimson pulp like an Easter egg with red dye on the inside. Early in the film Conan uses his sword to give a warrior from an enemy clan an instant nose job -- he cuts off the mans nose to spite his race -- and in a later encounter he picks the hapless dudes nose ripping off the nose guard and sticking his fingers into the wormy hole. Well Conan is a barbarian. Unlike most of the summers musclemen movies this one disdains a pop-art color scheme for a brown palette of muck and dried blood. Shot in Bulgaria which provided the production team with plenty of castles caves and other bleak scenery Conan is almost as muddy as it is bloody; if the tone is not quite as medieval-grimy as Monty Python and the Holy Grail or Jabberwocky its in the same studiously schmutzy range. The film is advertised as being in 3-D and it chucks an arsenal of spears the cameras way but the glasses given to customers make the effects look murky. In fact only some scenes are shown in 3-D (Id guess about 20%) so you can watch most of the film without the specs and get a brighter view of the carnage. In this dank ultimate-fighting challenge Jason Momoa as Conan provides the only visual vivacity; he has an eye-catchingly sensuous face atop the requisite statuesque beefcake. Much more than Schwarzenegger in his early Teutonic-slab phase Momoa nicely fulfills the law of Hollywood Darwinism survival of the dishiest. Such is his sex appeal that he almost brings plausibility to the movies silliest scene when Conan tells Tamara ""I live I love I slay and I am content"" and the virgin instantly falls into his arms. Guys bringing their dates to this murky holocaust are advised not to try using Conans credo as a pickup line. See Richard Schickels review of the original 1982 Conan the Barbarian.

"Conan the Barbarian (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Conan the Barbarian (R) Neutering a character who was known for his brutishness. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald8/17/2011 Editor rating 1 Pity the fool who tries to reprise the role that made Arnold Schwarzegger an icon. In 1982s Conan the Barbarian when he was asked ""What is best in life?"" he responded with the immortal line ""To crush your enemies to see them driven before you and to hear the lamentations of their women"" and you smiled in recognition knowing a movie star had been born. The new Conan played by Jason Momoa might answer the same question with ""How about a night in with friends playing Yahtzee?"" Momoa a familiar face from Game of Thrones to Baywatch has the muscles but not the imposing persona and barbaric presence that Conan requires. Momoa plays him like a gentle giant -- if he hadnt watched his entire village and family slaughtered as a child he could have easily become a cook or tailor -- and Schwarzeneggers ghost dogs him in every scene. Even the awful Conan the Destroyer was better than this - and that movie was awful. (Note I saw the movie in 2D and it looked fine; I cant imagine what there is to gain from the 3D version except your money). Conan was directed by Marcus Nispel who specializes in slick unremarkable remakes of hit movies (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Friday the 13th). Nispel is a good shooter and knows how to frame a memorable image but he has no sense of storytelling or narrative one thing just leads to another. Conan has two foes to conquer Khalar (Stephen Lang) who wields a cool double scimitar and his witchy daughter Marique (Rose McGowan) who excels at using long fingernails to look extra evil. The damsel-in-distress (Rachel Nichols) proves she can take care of herself when she needs to. But it all feels derivative and overdone including the big finale which resembles the climax of a James Bond picture. Even Ron Perlman in the requisite prologue depicting the murder of Conans family looks bored playing the soon-to-be-slaughtered lamb for the millionth time. The film has some good production values and I like the sand monsters that disintegrate when sliced in half then put themselves back together and return for another attack. There are other fantastical creatures including a giant CGI serpent and a couple of good gross-outs like Conan sticking his finger into the face of a man whose nose has been sliced off. Whats missing here is a grasp of Robert E. Howards original creation which was the sense of a brute making his way through an unpredictable unforgiving world and steamrollingthrough everything in his path. Hes a barbarian. for Gods sake. This Conan is more like a school-crossing guard who gives you the evil eye and rattles his sword when you disobey the ""Dont Walk"" sign.Wheres the ferocity?

Comments click to enlarge Conan the Barbarian 3D Video Rated R  112 minutes  2011 This rehash of the classic fantasy comic (popularly known as the basis for the first Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle) is rife with the oldest and simplest pleasures of 3-D movies all sorts of objects fly at the camera and the climactic battle takes place over a deep dark chasm. At its best the movie suggests a funhouse at a state-of-the-art county fair; at its worst its a fairly dumb celebration of brute violence. Jason Momoa (from HBOs Game of Thrones) plays the title character a mythical warrior seeking revenge on the people who slaughtered his tribe. He lacks Schwarzeneggers charisma though the other players (including Ron Perlman Rose McGowan and international mixed martial arts fighter Bob Sapp) have fun fleshing out the various fantasy-story types.

"Conan the Barbarian movie review by Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Conan still blood-soaked returns with a dash of PCConan the Barbarian -- 2 starsAugust 18 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie criticJason Momoa stars in ""Conan the Barbarian.""One hundred and 12 minutes of ""Aaaaarrrrrrrrggggghhhh"" -- the new 3-D edition of ""Conan the Barbarian"" was shot in Bulgaria so really its ""Conan the Bulgarian Barbarian."" And hes a vulgarian natch so ""Conan the Bulgarian Vulgarian Barbarian"" is another option.Born in the depths of the Depression the tough-guy-with-the-sword created by Robert E. Howard is best known from the 1982 film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. Now the role has been conquered by the half-Hawaiian half-Irish all-glowering Jason Momoa lately of HBOs ""Game of Thrones.""The actor appears to have a sense of humor somewhere in there behind the glower and the raspy growl. But the movie doesnt really encourage it. Its mostly noise and splurch and as I mentioned aaaaarrrrggggghhhhh The thesis line spoken by Momoa says it all ""I live. I love. I slay. I am content.""Conan has moved up a notch on the sensitivity ladder since 82 when Schwarzeneggers big line explained his reason for getting up in the morning thusly ""To crush your enemies to see them driven before you and to hear the lamentations of their women."" The new Conan may address the comely Tamara (Rachel Nichols blase even when screaming) once or twice with a ""Woman Come here"" but thats about it.I should mention something about the world in which ""Conan the Barbarian"" takes place. For those new to this world Conan is ripped out of his mothers womb in the midst of a pretty rough battlefield situation. His father (played by Ron Perlman) trains him well. They are Cimmerians and Conan must save the nations of Hyboria.Tamara comes from a long line of Sorcerers of Acheron and the blood of Tamara is the key ingredient in activating the dreaded magical Mask of Acheron coveted by the man who slew Conans father the evil Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang doing the kind of bad acting only a good actor can provide). Mr. Zym as The New York Times would refer to him has a half witch half mean-girl daughter played by Rose McGowan.The film revels in its beheadings and a particularly wince-worthy scene wherein Conan asserting his barbarous way with a sight gag sticks his fingers directly inside the nose-hole of the face of an enemy recently made noseless thanks to Conans mighty sword. Director Marcus Nispel responsible for the rebooted ""Friday the 13th"" delivers digital blood by the liter.Ive certainly seen worse movies this summer though I hope that if director Nispel returns to the land of Hyboria hell learn that sword fights dont respond well to his chaotic brand of staging made worse by the editing. If you dont know whos splurching whom or whose head just came off why even go to Hyboria this time of year?mjphillipstribune.comConan the Barbarian -- 2 starsMPAA rating R (for strong bloody violence some sexuality and nudity)Cast Jason Momoa (Conan); Rachel Nichols (Tamara); Stephen Lang (Khalar Zym); Rose McGowan (Marique); Said Taghmaoui (Ela-Shan); Leo Howard (Young Conan); Ron Perlman (Corin)Credits Directed by Marcus Nispel; written by Thomas Dean Donnelly Joshua Oppenheimer and Sean Hood based on Robert E.

As an encore the sword-swinging Cimmerian went on to establish Arnold Schwarzeneggers place in pop culture nearly 30 years ago when the young Austrian bodybuilder played the title role in John Milius booming storming militaristic take on the saga. Youd think Conan would deserve a rest and a haircut -- and that barbarians might be out of season. Bah Or as Conan himself might say GRRRRROWWWRRR Borrowing some of the same loinwear he favored as a far more charismatic tribal warrior in HBOs Game of Thrones Jason Momoa is the all-new Conan in Conan the Barbarian 3D a production that is itself a slave to its time. Or should I say to our time As directed by commercial- and music-video-trained Marcus Nispel (Friday the 13th The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) heres a movie thats simultaneously lavishly violent and numbing visually ornate and undistinguished epic and shallow relentlessly noisy and tone-deaf workmanlike and unfilling. And thats no matter how happily go-to villain-player Stephen Lang (Avatar) pitches in to enliven the character of Conans power-mad evil nemesis Khalar Zym. Conan has noble reason to loathe the scarfaced guy since the warlord killed Conan?s father an honorable Cimmerian leader and an expert sword-maker (played by Hellboys Ron Perlman) in front of the young sons eyes and now the grown man seeks revenge. But still the mission seems more plotted by numbers than written from the heart. (Audiences are likely to miss Disney stripling Leo Howard who plays the young Conan once the kid is no longer in the picture; hes got a fierce scowl this child performer and the scenes between him and Lang shoot off like little firecrackers.) Rose McGowan does interesting perverse things with her eyeballs and lips as Khalars twisted witchy daughter but the team-written script doesnt own up to the warped father-daughter relationship at which it coyly hints. Rachel Nichols (Star Trek) doesnt do much thats interesting at all as the feisty ""pureblood"" maiden who becomes Conans fighting ally and (in one perfunctorily gauzy scene) his lover but the fault is that of the generic female character not Ms. Nichols coached to flash eyes when vexed and scream when scared. In other words theres something and nothing for everyone in Conan the Barbarian 3D right down to the afterthought 3-D itself which brings nothing to the experience except a ticket-price bump.

Howard a big brawling bookish son of the Texas plains born into the first era in which the United States could truly call the region settled lived in front of a typewriter dreaming up tales of powerful men and lusty women. His fantasies synced up with those offered in pulp magazines like Weird Tales allowing him to eke out a living selling stories at pennies a word. With his most famous character the warrior Conan Howard crafted pulp-friendly stories of blood bare flesh and magic that doubled as a long sustained sigh about the fragility of civilization and the hypocrisies of those who called themselves civilized. Howard made Conan a brute with a point of view and with him created the sword-and-sorcery genre. Anyone trying to adapt Conan to the big screen has the burden of doing right by one of the most influential imaginations of the 20th century but also a lot of rich material with which to work. It shouldnt in other words be that hard to make a good Conan movie. John Milius did a half-decent job with Conan The Barbarian in 1982 but this new film of the same name feels like a half-hearted revamp of virtually any of the Conan rip-offs that clogged up video-store shelves in the 80s. It could just as easily be called Johnny Swordguy as Conan. Commercial director turned botched-remake expert Marcus Nispel (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Friday The 13th) throws in a full complement of clanging swords spurting blood and necromancy but ties them to a revenge tale that has Conan seeking revenge against a megalomaniacal warlord (Stephen Lang) in possession of a mystical mask and his spell-casting daughter (Rose McGowan). The trouble starts with a prologue featuring a head-spinning info dump rivaled only by David Lynchs adaptation of Dune and the film improves only marginally during a sequence detailing Conans upbringing at the hands of a father played by Ron Perlman. (Those scenes snow-and-mud aesthetic owe an unacknowledged debt to Kurt Busiek and Greg Ruths Born On The Battlefield graphic novel an example of how to update Conan for modern audiences that the film might have looked at a little more closely.) Any flickering hope dies with the coming of the grown-up Conan played by Jason Momoa. The hulking Momoas effective in a not-worlds-removed-role on Game Of Thrones but unlike in Thrones here he barks and growls his dialogue with the unpracticed enthusiasm of a first-time Ren Fair performer. Hes not acting. Hes LARPing. The grim material around him doesnt provide much distraction. Nispel seems lost when trying to film a simple swordfight much less the full-on battles The special effects are sparing and not particularly special and the green-screen backgrounds and scenes shot in what looks like the cloudiest parts of Bulgaria make a poor substitute for Howards Hyborian Age landscapes. They and the stories that take place there remain again trapped on the page waiting for a better adaptation.

Conan the Barbarian Bomb to bad Director Marcus Nispel. Cast Jason Momoa Ron Perlman Rose McGowan. Rating R for strong violence some sexuality and nudity. This weeks new movie releases Off with their shirts Swords and sandals Movies based on comic books But who exactly was wishing for it? The 1982 original launched the acting career of Arnold Schwarzenegger of course and was awash in violence the occasional bad accent and best of all camp. (The sequel included Wilt Chamberlain AND Grace Jones.) Jason Momoa gives Conan the Barbarian some finesse Now comes director Marcus Nispels remake and its just awash in blood. Nispel who also has directed remakes of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Friday the 13th"" goes in for the old ultra-violence as Alex might say in ""A Clockwork Orange"" which will surely be the only comparison between that classic and this mess youll ever see. Conan (Leo Howard plays him as a child) is a little savage from the start. Hes born in the middle of a battle to his dying mother raised by his father (Ron Perlman) to be a warrior and while still a boy handily dispatches a band of adults without breaking the egg he is carrying in his mouth which makes about as much sense as it sounds like. Conan and his people are Cimmerians and are attacked by enemies seeking pieces of a broken mask which when put back together blah blah blah something or other just whip out the swords and start chopping each others limbs off because thats about as deep as it gets. If you insist on more theres this Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang) kills Conans father in front of the boy. All grown up Conan now played by Jason Momoa (best known for HBOs ""Game of Thrones"") is a muscle-bound revenge-seeking killing machine who appears to have borrowed Keith Richards mascara. He is determined to avenge his fathers death by finding and killing Zym. Zym meanwhile is trying to attain godlike status by activating the mask with the pure blood of a woman - specifically Tamara (Rachel Nichols who seems to be the only person in the movie having any fun). Hes attempting to find her with the help of his daughter Marique (Rose McGowan) some sort of witch who dabbles in sadistic torturous killing on the side when not tasting the blood of women she slices to find out if they are pure. A prophecy decrees that Tamara will cross paths with a warrior and what do you know here comes Conan. They team up in more ways than one and it all leads to a violent (of course) showdown that lasts what seems like forever but is in reality only about 10 minutes longer than human capacity for withstanding such punishment. The audience I mean not the combatants. Theres just not a lot to like here with the exception of what may be one of the all-time best bad movie lines one Conan utters to Tamara as a kind of personal credo ""I live. I love. I slay. I am content."" That makes one of us. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter twitter.com/goodyk.

Howard and more satisfyingly pulpy than the 1982 movie incarnation. Director Marcus Nispel along with no fewer than three screenwriters eschews the lugubrious mythmaking of that version in favor of Howards less fussy nihilism--""I live I love I slay . . . I am content"" Conan confides to a captive.After setting up its story with a flashback sequence Conan proceeds with an inventively shocking cold open in which the fetal Conan is cut from his dying mothers womb on a battlefield. This sets the tone for what follows because while Nispel never lets his movie become dull it truly comes alive only when people are hacking other people to bits. The narrative picks up when the preteen lad (Leo Howard) sees his father (Ron Perlman) and entire village slaughtered by the army of Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang) a googly-eyed loon in search of a supernatural mask said to bestow godhood. Years later the grown-up-and-out Conan (Jason Momoa) seeks revenge eventually teaming up with a proto-Greek nun (prissy Rachel Nichols) who figures into Zyms scheme.Conan suffers from third-act doldrums--perhaps inevitable when B-movie material lands an A-plus budget--and CGI cartoonishness but its 3-D effects are surprisingly subtle. Nispel and cinematographer Thomas Kloss also succeed at capturing the visual panache of Frank Frazettas celebrated adaptations of Howards stories and the lush Bulgarian locations practically bend to their will. The results at their best nicely evoke those Ray Harryhausen-animated sword-and-sorcery adventures of the 1960s only a lot bloodier. Squeamish types may balk but the gory cruelty on display here is faithful to the source material and deeply thrilling.Is that enough? Expecting anything besides gratifying spectator sadism from a Hollywood action blockbuster is absurd of course. But given that its less than a month away from the 10th anniversary--if thats the proper word--of our cultures last collective encounter with barbarity a pulp exploration of the blowback from unchecked retribution mightve been refreshing. Conan flirts with this sensibility in its anti-imperialistic undercurrent and Zyms backstory (turns out hes motivated by payback for a lost loved one too) but fatally hedges. The movie stumbles on its predictably Manichaean square-off and the chimerical presence of Pure Evil.Still give Conan the Barbarian credit for not presenting these hordes as swarthy ethnic caricatures a la The Lord of the Rings (for the most part anyway). Even better its key philosophical question--""Are we all just doomed to chaos and ruin?""--is left admirably open-ended.

Conan has mellowed if ever so slightly since the days when a certain Austrian bodybuilder portrayed the pulp fantasy hero. That doesnt mean his latest bloodbath also titled ""Conan the Barbarian"" is any tamer; merely that the protagonist in this Marcus Nispel-directed reboot shows a modicum of respect toward the men he slays and topless wenches he liberates. More importantly the well-executed pic solves the biggest challenge facing those hoping to breathe new life -- however nasty brutish and short -- into the 79-year-old franchise by finding an actor capable of filling Ah-nulds shoes all of which portends brawny international biz with sequels to follow. Conan rights holder Millennium Films took a considerable gamble in casting little-known Hawaiian actor-model Jason Momoa who nevertheless as a burly long-haired horse of a man with biceps the size of battering rams and a big scar running down his left cheek seems made for the part. The bet paid off as Momoas star rose earlier this summer thanks to his role as Khal Drogo on HBOs ""Game of Thrones."" That break combined with a slightly more femme-friendly depiction of Conan -- including a gratuitous glimpse of the barbarians backside -- suggests the producers have figured a way to inject pulp-romance appeal into Robert E. Howards classic hero. The other big wild card in this equation was musicvideo director Marcus Nispel who has carved out a curious niche for himself rebooting B-movie franchises. After bringing a measure of visual style to ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Friday the 13th"" the helmer once again exceeds expectations however modest they may have been to begin with. Audiences headed to a Conan movie already know what theyre going to get so it doesnt make sense to chide those responsible for crafting a work of unrelenting barbarism. Theres blood and bare breasts aplenty from Conans birth on the battlefield -- where his father (Ron Perlman) can be seen slitting the man-child from his dying mothers womb in an outrageous opening scene -- to his climactic showdown with Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang). In short like last summers ""The Expendables"" (also produced by Avi Lerner) the film delivers hard-R escapism for 13-year-old intellects aimed to satisfy those looking to rest their brains but not their ears. Attempting to separate themselves somewhat from the earlier Schwarzenegger-starring pics Nispel and his cohorts announced a respectful back-to-the-books approach but its really more of the same. Like the 1982 John Milius-directed film ""Conan the Barbarian"" shows the young Cimmerian (played by Leo Howard) witnessing the death of his parents hunting down the man responsible for their murder and demonstrating himself worthy of the sword he will wield in later adventures. Joining the monosyllabic hero -- whose mantra amounts to a grunted ""I live I love I slay and I am content"" -- are such stock characters as a campy sorceress (Rose McGowan) a thieving sidekick (Said Taghmaoui) and a pure-blooded maiden (Rachel Nichols). Screenwriters Thomas Dean Donnelly Joshua Oppenheimer and Sean Hood mercifully spare us most of the arcane mythology with which Howard larded his original tales putting what little setup auds need into the mouth of narrator Morgan Freeman whose presence offers the first clue that the project aspires to some sort of respectability. With all earnestness Nispel embraces the propertys classic roots placing this new ""Conan"" squarely within the tradition of sword-and-sorcery pics. Visually the world hews close to the dark iconic look established by fantasy painter Frank Frazetta which will no doubt please devotees but offers as little room for surprise as the films recycled storyline. Although the battle scenes are updated with the kind of on-camera carnage that 21st-century digital enhancement allows many of the effects -- ranging from CG cities to a multi-tentacled sea creature -- are just a notch above the high-def TV standard seen on ""Game of Thrones."" There is however one notable exception An exhilarating mid-movie action scene produced by Tom Horton and Reliance MediaWorks conjures a bunch of impressive shape-shifting sand warriors who materialize out of thin air to antagonize the wild-eyed Conan. For the most part nimble editing makes it possible to make sense of complex action sequences but often comes at the expense of the films unnecessary 3D. Overall the extra dimension doesnt add much apart from one or two flinch-inducing moments when a weapon goes flying out into the audience. With his bulging physique Momoa is more 3D-friendly than most stars but the technique does little to enhance it serving instead to emphasize the separation between the otherwise flat foreground and background planes. In addition to its epic-scale indoor stages Bulgaria supplies terrain varied enough to suggest the many kingdoms of Hyboria but isnt likely to inspire many vacations.

TWITTER The latest incarnation of Robert E. Howards barbarian of prehistory stars Jason Momoa Rachel Nichols Stephen Lang and Rose McGorwan. The new Conan the Barbarian may be the first film -- and the first of many one fears -- to be aimed entirely at video gamers. The filmmakers throw story and character to the wind to send an avatar into a field of continual battle to slay enemies coming from all sides. Every rip of his sword sends a fountain of blood into the air and every gouge punch and back flip comes with amplified sound effects. Say what you will about John Milius 1982 version of Conan that film at least had a concept. Milius long a student of Japanese culture brought pulp fiction writer Robert E. Howards homoerotic misogynistic barbarian of prehistory to the screen with influences of the warrior code of bushido and cinematic overtones of John Ford and Akira Kurosawa to create a Nietzschian display of unfettered male virility. The new film is merely dedicated to unfettered carnage in 3D. STORY Conan the Barbarian Director Reveals How Reboot Will Differ From Arnold Schwarzenegger Classic Whether this version will attract gamers and young men of a generation who think Conan is a skinny redheaded late-night talk show host is open to question. Certainly the look of the film shot in locations throughout Bulgaria and in Nu Boyana Studios is dramatic with sweeping landscapes improved digitally to resemble an angry sensual time in pre-Christian Europe where dark magic rules and brutal warriors kill with impunity. But how long can you gaze at a landscape empty of story and character? Replacing Arnold Schwarzenegger as the original Barbarian is Jason Momoa (HBOs Game of Thrones) a Hawaiian-born hulk with ripped muscles and absurd good looks. He certainly fits the part. For that matter all the casting works in visual terms. Rachel Nichols is lovely and feisty as a temple princess who fights by Conans side. Stephen Lang personifies badass evil as Conans chief opponent while Rose McGowans snakelike witch is pure villainy. VIDEO Conan the Barbarian Fights Bloody Battle in Movies First Scene Chiseled Nonso Anozie looks rocklike as Conans staunch compatriot while Ron Perlman dressed and coiffed to resemble ancient statutes of the Greek god Zeus plays Conans warrior father. Alas blunt-force acting rules the screen with everyone grunting snarling and posturing to ludicrous effect. Dialogue is at a premium as this impedes the killing game. Indeed at one point when Nichols character threatens to get chatty Momoa stuffs a rag in her mouth. The only actors who actually make an impact is Nichols who displays just enough nervy grit to stand out and 13-year-old Leo Howard a first-degree black belt who plays young Conan as a feral animal ever looking for prey. The story? Oh the screenplay by Thomas Dean Donnelly Joshua Oppenheimer and Sean Hood concerns something about a search for scattered pieces of the powerful Mask of Acheron and then a search for a ""pure blood"" descendant of sorcerers whose blood will awaken the mask. The movie wastes no more time explaining all this then it took you to read that sentence. These are mere excuses to get characters from point A to points B and C. VIDEO Conan the Barbarian New Red-Band Trailer Released To give the movie its due those locations are astutely fabricated by production designer Chris August and cinematographer Thomas Kloss with a considerable assist from CGI artists. Indeed the movies best moments come in long shots or sweeping camera passes over each new location with an accompanying super identifying the name and purpose of this new site. (The one labeled ""City of Thieves"" causes one to wonder if this means that an honest man would be an outlaw in this metropolis. Your mind does wander while watching this film.) And again to give the film credit the action is cleverly designed so that Conan -- he of the ""I live I love I slay I am content"" mantra -- performs his slash-and-gouge routine which could grow tiresome in dramatically different situations. One involving sand warriors springing out of dust to bedevil Conan is particularly ingenious although it goes on too long. Thats true for all the fights though especially the extended battles between Conan and Langs Khalar Zym where the filmmakers must invent obstacles to keep Conan from dispatching his foe too soon. The choreographer of this controlled mayhem is German-born director Marcus Nispel who seems to have developed a career as a remaker of other peoples movies having directed new versions of Friday the 13th The Texas Chainsaw Massacre andFrankenstein. His imposes no personal vision on Conan however no Milius-like perspective or visual design. There is no purpose to the film other than random blood splattering amid scenes of bondage primitive savagery and Samp;M eroticism. The film is numbing and dumb with its hero indistinguishable from its villains. Conan fights under no moral code nor stands for any principle. If the film were called Khalar Zym he wouldnt even be the good guy.
