(Francois Duhamel/Universal Pictures via AP) Steve Jobs (Michael Fassbender) could not be described as a sensitive guy. The tech guru and Apple Inc. front man is all about results. Employees who dont meet his expectations tend to become ex-employees.Jobs considers himself not just a businessman but an artist who works with people in much the same way as the conductor of an orchestra. And if that means hes chastised for being a prima donna so be it.As much as his critics resent Jobs they have to admit that even his failures are interesting. But its extremely tough to be his friend as his colleagues Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet) and Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen) have come to realize. Apple marketing executive Hoffman cant believe that Jobs refuses to acknowledge that he has a young daughter whom he treats with shocking cruelty. Wozniak who co-founded Apple with Jobs and whose skills as an electronics engineer and computer programmer were key to its success is upset that his old buddy has the nerve to take most of the credit.Behind the scenes at product launches in 1984 1988 and 1998 Jobs is on uninhibited display -- as a genius and as a jerk. ""Steve Jobs"" is an art film with just enough star wattage to give it a shot at multiplex supremacy. Directed by Danny Boyle (""Slumdog Millionaire"") the film is also the latest offering from screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (""The Social Network"") who brings his knack for literate dialogue and lively dramatics to a story that could easily have been insufferably inaccessible. If nothing else Sorkin deserves credit for taking a fresh approach to the biopic The film is not so much about what Jobs did as why he did it. Fassbender is intriguingly opaque as a man for whom the end justifies the means. Winslet brings just the right energy to the often exasperated Hoffman and Rogen is surprisingly effective as the morally upright Wozniak.As original and risk-taking as its subject ""Steve Jobs"" will make you think differently about an American icon.What ""Steve Jobs""  31/2 stars out of four  Run time 202  Rating R  Content Language  Calvin Wilson  314-340-8346calvinwilsonstl on Twittercalvinwilsonpost-dispatch.com Tags Steve Jobs Michael Fassbender Calvin Wilson Calvin Wilson Calvin Wilson is an arts writer for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size Christopher Orr Oct 16 2015 Culture Leave it to the screenwriter Aaron Sorkin to describe the life of Steve Jobs in the form of a behind-the-scenes showbiz tale. He did it for sports with Sports Night for sketch comedy with Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip and for news with The Newsroom. Now with Steve Jobs hes done it for the tech revolution. In keeping with this framework the film presents its titular subject as one part visionary three parts impresario and narcissist all the way through. Related Story The Revision of Steve Jobs The movie directed with customary panache by Danny Boyle (Trainspotting Slumdog Millionaire) is a canny narrative told in three distinct acts each involving the launch of a particular product and each presented in its own aesthetic style. The unveiling of the Macintosh in 1984 is shot on grainy 16mm film and scored with vintage synthesizers. The introduction of the NeXT computer which took place in 1988 during Jobss hiatus from Apple uses 35mm film and a full orchestra. And the 1998 launch of the iMac following his triumphant return to the company is shot digitally and features a contemporary electronic score.The result is a film that almost advertises its own artificiality--Sorkin has been upfront about the fact that almost all of the dialogue is fictionalized--and as such one thats more akin to a stage play than to a conventional biopic. In the minutes preceding each product launch Jobs (Michael Fassbender) interacts with a recurring array of friendly antagonists his right-hand woman and ""work wife"" Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet); the Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen); the onetime Apple CEO John Sculley (Jeff Daniels); the engineer Andy Hertzfeld (Michael Stuhlbarg); and Jobss daughter Lisa (played by three different actresses at different ages). I doubt Ill be the first to note the resemblance to A Christmas Carol and its ghosts of past present and future.On a technical level Steve Jobs is a triumph. Although talky in the extreme it almost buzzes with electricity. The dialogue is an intracardiac injection of pure adrenalized Sorkin. And as David Fincher did in The Social Network Boyle imbues the performers many backs and forths with the narrative velocity of a car chase.Fassbender is remarkable in the title role offering arguably his best performance to date. When playing a figure as well known as Jobs there are two courses that a performer can typically steer. One is straightforward mimesis capturing the characters look (possibly with prosthetic assistance) mannerisms and intonations--as for instance Cate Blanchett did frustratingly with Katharine Hepburn in The Aviator. The other is to leave such feats to the impressionists and instead seek to inhabit the person beneath the tics and accent--as Christopher Plummer did brilliantly with his portrayal of Mike Wallace in The Insider. (Readers may recall alas which role won an Oscar and which was not even nominated.) Fassbender opts for the latter path here to tremendous effect. His Jobs is by any reasonable measure an awful person stubborn ungracious and utterly self-absorbed. Yet his vitality is such that it lends magnetism to his mania. Even at his worst its hard to look away.Jobss vitality is such that it lends magnetism to his mania. Even at his worst its hard to look away.The rest of the cast is strong as well despite being given little opportunity to do more than offer themselves up as mirrors to Jobss megalomania. All five supporting characters are principally defined by the fact that they are at least in contrast to the man they orbit relatively normal decent human beings. Woz wants Jobs always obsessed with the new to offer a mere acknowledgement of the old Apple II product team that made the company an initial success. Sculley wants to let bygones be bygones. And everyone wants Jobs to treat his daughter Lisa with some minimal degree of parental attention and affection. (Late in the film Jobs complains ""Its like five minutes before every launch everyone goes to a bar gets drunk and tells me what they really think of me."" Its a clever nod to the films strict architecture at once self-indicting and self-inoculating.)It is the fitfully improving relationship between Jobs and Lisa that offers the central narrative arc of the film. (In the first act he denies his paternity and unpersuasively declares that Apples earlier ""Lisa"" computer was not named after her.) This subplot makes for a tidy tale but a rather narrow one. And it is hard to shake the sense that the filmmakers are to some degree intent on advertising their ""scoop"" in getting the real-life Lisa to talk to them much the way a newspaper article leads with any new scrap of proprietary reporting however incremental or irrelevant. (Sorkins script is otherwise adapted principally from Walter Isaacsons 2011 biography with which Lisa declined to cooperate.)The result is a redemptive fable (though one in which the redemption comes rather cheap) at once artful elegant and clean. If there is a complaint to be made--and I believe there is--it is that it is too clean. I have no particular grievance with the movies many departures from fact. (It seems ungenerous to deny the filmmakers their own ""reality-distortion field."") But by stripping out any and all complications from the story it wishes to tell the movie denies itself the opportunity for nuance and puts a ceiling on its own ambition. In order to make the Jobs-Lisa relationship the ultimate measure of the man for instance no mention is made of the fact that by the final act in 1998 Jobs was married--a union that lasted two decades until his 2011 death--and had two younger children soon to be three.I enjoyed Steve Jobs a great deal and I suspect most moviegoers will feel the same way. But I left the theater with no better understanding of its subject than when I arrived. For all its exceptional craftsmanship the film ultimately lacks a true inner life. In this way it resembles the NeXT computer that Jobs unveiled in 1988 a beautiful obsidian cube that alas didnt have an operating system.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip.

Barry Hertz The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Oct. 15 2015 433PM EDT Last updated Thursday Oct. 15 2015 434PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Danny Boyle Written by Aaron Sorkin Starring Michael Fassbender Kate Winslet and Seth Rogen Classification 14A Country USA Language English Two years ago an unprecedented rash of big-screen jerks flooded the all-important fall movie season. Inside Llewyn Davis American Hustle The Wolf of Wall Street Nebraska and Blue Jasmine all focused on an impressive range of bastards putzes and assholes.But while each featured award-worthy performances from actors brave enough to embrace the antihero none of those impressively unlovable characters can stand next to Michael Fassbenders Steve Jobs cinemas new SOB benchmark. As the demanding egotistical vicious manipulative and prickish genius behind Apple Fassbender delivers a Jobs who is magnetic in his contemptibility. He threatens subordinates shoves his family aside rips apart friendships carries on a 19-year-long game of emotional abuse with his most loyal confidante and takes credit where little or none is due. And through it all we cant stop watching him.Thanks to Fassbenders revelatory performance - a carefully calibrated mix of pride self-loathing frustration arrogance and near-visceral self-righteousness - Jobs comes across as a captivating monster a dictator in a black turtleneck who is impossible to ignore.Whether or not thats who Steve Jobs actually was is a different matter. As he did with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network screenwriter Aaron Sorkin again takes the idea of a genius and twists it to his own gains. While Jobs was known for his unrelenting perfectionism corporate feuds and difficult personal life Sorkin creates his own beast and doesnt give a damn about whether its accurate or not. (""This was clearly an impressionistic thing"" the writer has said. ""I hope the movie announces itself as being a painting instead of a photograph."")Its easy to be tempted into an ethical debate here but when the results are so compelling (such as The Social Network) its justifiable to accept the product as simply art with a complicated past and not some sort of true-to-life docu-narrative. After all its not as if Steve Jobs the film attempts to distill every single aspect of Steve Jobs the man. Instead of the predictable biopic structure so drilled into audience expectations the drama is carved up into three acts each set at different product launches over Jobss career (1984s Macintosh 1988s NeXT and 1998s iMac).While Jobs prepares for each crucial innovation he is confronted backstage by the friends lovers and colleagues who both complete and vex him. (This being a Sorkin film everyone is also equipped with an astounding sense of wit and ability to talk really really fast while making analogies that dont always quite make sense.) The result is a tense window into a mans evolving sense of self and a fast-forwarded examination of how a few decisions can painfully ricochet over a lifetime. Its also though a conceit that wears a bit thin by the films end when even Jobs wonders aloud ""Its as if five minutes before every launch everyone goes to a bar gets drunk and tells me what they really think.""Also denting matters is Danny Boyles flashy and occasionally off-kilter direction. While Sorkin had hoped to reteam with Social Network helmer David Fincher after a series of mini-controversies the Slumdog Millionaire filmmaker was brought in instead. For the most part Boyle handles Sorkins standard walk-and-talk sequences with a quiet flair but every now and then he gives in to his more base instincts whether its needlessly projecting dialogue on scenery clumsily inserting archival footage or shooting from comically extreme angles.Its as if Boyle didnt think Sorkins serrated-knife of a script was sharp enough or Fassbenders performance towering enough and felt the need to torque the tension. There is of course no need. Thanks to Sorkins humming dialogue and layered career-best performances from the cast (including Kate Winslet Seth Rogen and Sorkin vet Jeff Daniels) drama is in no short supply.Yet nothing would have mattered if it werent for Fassbender. While the films long production cycled through several high-profile leading men (Leonardo DiCaprio Christian Bale) and Jobss story has been told on screen before Fassbenders take is so fierce rotten sour and powerful that it will last a lifetime.

"Steve Jobs a man as imperfect and insanely great as his machines review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesSteve Jobs a man as imperfect and insanely great as his machines reviewSteve Jobs is imperfect like the late Apple icon it sketches. But the film also entertains and enlightens.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Oct. 16 2015Steve JobsStarring Michael Fassbender Kate Winslet Jeff Daniels Michael Stuhlbarg and Katherine Waterston. Directed by Danny Boyle. Opens Friday at the Varsity (wide release Oct. 23). 119 minutes. 14ASteve Jobs is an imperfect creation like the late Apple icon it furiously sketches and the evolving computers it celebrates. The film is a subjective portrait not a photograph as screenwriter Aaron Sorkin candidly admits.Yet it entertains and enlightens and its bang on in showing how great ideas are born not through compromise but through vision and determination. Article Continued BelowSorkin and director Danny Boyle narrowly define their narrative while also freestyling dialogue and history. They merely dip into Walter Isaacsons authorized biography of the same title and they employ a lead actor Michael Fassbender who resembles Jobs only in intelligence and energy. The three-act film turns on the backstage drama at three signal life events for Jobs all of them computer launches the Macintosh in 1984 the NeXTcube in 1988 and the iMac in 1998. The movies visual textures join the evolution first in 16mm then in 35mm and finally in digital format.Jobs is seen not as the bearded and barefoot hippie of his earliest 1970s media incarnation but as the bespoke capitalist and bespectacled patrician he becomes in later transformations. Michael Fassbender appears in a scene from the film Steve Jobs. Movie critic Peter Howell says the film is imperfect but entertains and enlightens.  (Universal Pictures / The Associated Press)  Missing is any real sense of humour appreciation for the friends and workers he pushes to the breaking point or love for the legions of fans who buy the products hes forever tweaking. ""The very nature of people is something to overcome"" Jobs sneers.Fassbenders acidic Jobs is thus the most unlovable version of the late tech titan to hit public screens following two previous dramatic treatments and a recent Alex Gibney documentary. Yet hes also the most fascinating a figure of Shakespearian rage and contradictions. Credit Fassbenders ""insanely great"" performance to use a favourite Jobs expression but also an excellent supporting cast.Kate Winslet is a prod to conscience in the role of Macintosh marketing chief Joanna Hoffman one of the few people whom Jobs will listen to. Women rarely get the spotlight in Apple history accounts; Winslet corrects this with awards-beckoning strength and grace.Also worthy of applause Seth Rogen as neglected Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak; Jeff Daniels as father figure turned adversary John Sculley; Michael Stuhlbarg as beleaguered engineer Andy Hertzfeld; Katherine Waterston as ex-girlfriend Chrisann Brennan mother of the child Jobs initially disavowed; and Perla Haney-Jardine as the teenaged Lisa one of several actresses playing the daughter Jobs named a computer after but struggled to claim as family.Sorkin delves into Jobss troubled past as an adopted child abandoned at birth who in turn rejects his own progeny. A screenplay long on talk finally nails the mans essential ambivalence in just three short words of confession ""Im poorly made.""Through the constant refining and rhapsodizing of his machines Jobs sought to create the perfection he felt nature had denied him.

(Universal Pictures)By Steven Rea Inquirer Movie CriticPosted October 17 2015""Im poorly made.""Thats Steve Jobs talking - well wordsmith Aaron Sorkin channeling Steve Jobs - near the end of the film that bears the name of the Apple cofounder and late lamented mythologized criticized tech icon.Jobs (Michael Fassbender) is talking to his daughter Lisa (Perla Haney-Jardine) a Harvard freshman whose relationship with dad has been rocky to say the least. First Jobs denied that he was her father and even after DNA tests proved paternity he refused to acknowledge her. In Steve Jobs directed with cinematic gusto by Danny Boyle from a theater-piece Sorkin script Lisa comes and goes (ages 5 and 9 two very good young actresses) and the Silicon Valley gazillionaire treats her and her mother (Katherine Waterston) abominably every time.Jobs admission comes in response to the 19-year-old Lisas blunt query ""Why did you say you werent my father?"" And it comes after the storied product launches that defined Jobs early career - and gives the movie its three-act structure. The feat (and maybe the flaw) of Boyle and Sorkins Steve Jobs is that everything happens in a mad flurry of walk-and-talks and sit-still-and-soliloquize moments backstage and behind the scenes during the unveiling of the Macintosh computer in 1984 the launch of the NeXT black cube in 1988 and the iMac in 1998.Jobs bobs and weaves barking orders and brooding openly as he worries the details of the unveiling of these seminal machines. For much of the time he is shadowed by his marketing director and confidante Joanna Hoffman (an at-first-unrecognizable Kate Winslet) who double-duties as Jobs human PDA and as the audiences surrogate. John Sculley the soda company chairman whom Jobs hired to run Apple and then was fired by in a boardroom blowup appears prominently and dramatically. As played by Sorkins go-to man Jeff Daniels ( The Newsrooms Will McAvoy) Sculley is less the villain of the piece than a victim of Jobs Machiavellian schemes. More than anything else in the film - which credits Walter Isaacsons authorized Jobs biography as a main source - the Sculley scenario diverges from the accepted narrative.Is Steve Jobs a great film? I dont think so. Its an achievement certainly full of Sorkin flourishes breathtaking and brilliant one-liners that reveal a lot about the characters who deliver them.Boyle the Slumdog Millionaire Oscar winner who directed a National Theatre production of Frankenstein in 2011 and the London Summer Olympics opening hoopla in 2012 both respects the tight claustrophobic structure that Sorkin has handed him and pushes at it with the twitchiness of a restless kid.The acting is unarguably uniformly strong. Fassbenders Jobs bristles with urgency and angst and his skin practically sweats genius. Winslet with her heavy-rimmed glasses and soft mid-European twang makes Hoffmans presence - and importance - felt; Seth Rogen is Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak Jobs colleague back in that fabled garage now reduced to watching his pal from the audience as the curtain pulls back and the spotlights go on; Michael Stuhlbarg is Andy Hertzfeld part of Jobs original Macintosh team - and part of the reason Jobs finally owns up to his responsibilities as a parent.But putting aside questions of historical accuracy and psychological accuracy (there have been plenty of complaints from people who knew and worked with the man) Steve Jobs doesnt entirely add up. Yes he was a perfectionist a control freak. Yes he brushed people aside knocked people down reduced people to tears. And yes he was responsible for the look feel and function of some of the most life- and society-changing tools of our time.""Behind every beautiful thing theres been some kind of pain"" Bob Dylan sings in ""Not Dark Yet."" Dylan was one of Jobs artist gods (John Lennon was another) but Steve Jobs only goes so far in showing the pain that coursed through Jobs psyche.The beautiful things he made are a given now. The pain remains something of a mystery.sreaphillynews.com215-854-5629 Steven_Rea Steve Jobs  (Out of four stars) Written by Aaron Sorkin directed by Danny Boyle.

"Steve Jobs | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; steve-jobs ) Steve Jobs (United States 2015) October 15 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli When considering Steve Jobs the first thing to recognize is that this isnt a bio-pic. Oh the movie uses Jobs life as the basis of its story and cherry-picks facts and reminiscences to form the skeleton. But screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and director Danny Boyle arent interested in offering another re-enactment of the truth-is-stranger-than-fiction story. They have something more ambitious in mind. Their goal is to illustrate the tyranny of genius and how a ""great mind"" doesnt always mean a ""great person."" Steve Jobs is structured as a three-act play and like a stagebound production it features few sets and relies heavily on acting pacing and dialogue. By always putting the characters under the pressure of a ticking clock Boyle creates a constant sense of urgency. With the restlessly moving camera preferring long swooping takes to short static ones theres a sense of movement and energy that belies the limits of the locales. Its not unlike last years Birdman although the approach isnt as fanciful or extreme. At the center of the chaos is Steve Jobs (Michael Fassbender) the iconic co-creator of Apple whose wardrobe of a black mock turtleneck blue jeans and New Balance sneakers became his uniform. Jobs is undeniably brilliant with an arrogance to match his intelligence. He believes in his own infallibility accepting it as a defining precept. He mellows with age but not so much that he is willing to concede anything to anyone. Act One takes us to 1984 where Jobs is unveiling the Macintosh in front of an adoring audience. As the curtain prepares to go up control-freak Jobs is stalking his underlings behind the scenes browbeating Andy Herzfeld (Michael Stuhlberg) to get the demo computer talking driving his assistant Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet) nuts with his complaints and demands and berating his ex-lover Chrisann Brennan (Katherine Waterston). Chrisann has brought  Jobs daughter Lisa with her. She wants him to know that his offspring is now living on welfare because his child support payments are insufficient. Jobs refuses to acknowledge paternity but nevertheless forms a fragile bond with Lisa. His relationship with his daughter comprises the movies emotional core as things change and evolve over the next 14 years. Act Two occurs before another product launch 1988s NeXT Cube. No longer with the company he founded Jobs is plotting revenge against those who ousted him especially Apple CEO John Scully (Jeff Daniels). By 1998 the time period for Act Three Jobs is back at Apple and more at home in his own skin. He has mellowed to the extent that anyone with his personality could be said to ""mellow."" The event is the product launch of the iMac. For Apple this is a turning point - the beginning of the companys ascendancy. Before the presentation he clashes with several people. One is his old buddy Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen) who wants Jobs to acknowledge the efforts of the Apple 2 team - something he refuses to do. Another is Lisa who at age 19 has set aside some of her illusions about her father. Michael Fassbender who is a lock for the Best Lead Actor nomination he should have gotten for Shame doesnt bear a strong physical resemblance to Jobs. In fact Ashton Kutcher who played the role in 2013s lackluster Jobs was more effective in capturing the characters look. But Fassbender is a magnetic compelling presence. We never once doubt that he is Steve Jobs. His force of personality enhanced by Boyles shot selection holds the audience in awe for two hours. The supporting cast which includes such heavyweights as Kate Winslet (almost unrecognizable) Seth Rogen (perhaps the best dramatic performance he has given) and Jeff Daniels (in a role not dissimilar to the one he played in The Martian) provides an element of balance but no one steals a single scene from Fassbender. As a psychological profile Steve Jobs is probably shallow but the decision to focus on his personality rather than the events of his life make this a more interesting account than Jobs or the documentary Steve Jobs The Man in the Machine. The dialogue crackles with wit anger and passion. By matching Sorkins words with Boyles style and Fassbenders talent Steve Jobs has hit the trifecta. Although based on Walter Isaacsons book it fudges history a little in the name of compelling cinema. The movies portrait of the title character is likely to leave viewers ambiguous as they struggle with the question of how much arrogance boorishness and incivility can be forgiven in the name of genius. Steve Jobs doesnt so much tear down the myth of the man as reshape it into something more volatile.

(Not for nothing is the Apple co-founder so desperate to have the Mac say ""Hello"" at its unveiling.) Once again the result is not a biopic but an opportunity for Sorkin to use a famous person as fodder for a fiction about a man who uses technology to make up for his inability to deal with life in general and people in particular. The Social Networks Zuckerberg longed for social status and an understanding girlfriend; Steve Jobs Jobs wants ""end-to-end control"" something he was denied from the very beginning plus the freedom to never look back. Sorkin and his word-winging are the point here the walk-and-talks and occasional flashbacks aside director Danny Boyle has a highly structured backstage play on his hands and it doesnt give him much room to move. And while Michael Fassbender gives Jobs an air of icy assurance in his peer-to-peer dealings he cant quite sell the constant shifts in his relationship with daughter Lisa. Or rather Sorkin cant. With Kate Winslet Seth Rogen and Bill Pullman. 2015. -- Matthew Lickona This movie is not currently in theaters. Facebook Twitter Google+ Share Email Comments dwbat Oct. 15 2015  642 p.m. What a superdome full of Apple fanboys dont want to acknowledge is that Jobs didnt invent the Mac (he was busy working on the ""Lisa"" computer that bombed). According to Wikipedia ""The Macintosh project was begun in 1979 by Jef Raskin."" Many other people were major players including Andy Hertzfeld who is in the movie. Jobs came in late and tweaked a few things. Jobs really wasnt a nice guy; he was frankly an egomaniacal arrogant insensitive self-centered horses patoot. Sorkin realized that from reading the biography so decided to make that the films focus. Good idea as theres been too much hero-worshipping about the guy over the years. Jobs and Trump would probably have gotten along as they share similar flawed personalities and both took credit for things they didnt do. P.S. In an earlier biography of Jobs (before his comeback) employees complained about how bad he smelled (as he didnt think much of personal hygiene or laundered clothes). 1 0 Add photo Post reply Sign in to reply Sign in to suggest removal Sign in to comment Username I have an account.

"Review Steve Jobs plays man versus machine | The Big Story Skip to main content Latest News The Conversation Review Steve Jobs plays man versus machine By JAKE COYLE Oct. 6 2015 450 AM EDT When is someone going to open a window in Aaron Sorkins ""Steve Jobs""? Alas wrong operating system.Sorkin has dispensed with the traditional format of the biopic instead framing the life of the Apple co-founder and turtle-necked tech deity in three backstage dramas ahead of major product launches the Macintosh in 1984 NeXT in 1988 and the iMac in 1998. In the behind-the-scenes swirl Jobs (Michael Fassbender) is visited each time by ghosts of products past Apple engineer Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen) Apple CEO John Sculley (Jeff Daniels) and Jobs daughter Lisa (played by three actresses) whose paternity Jobs initially disputes.Its a scheme of three-act purity as tightly compacted as the circuitry of an iPod and one that few besides Sorkin would dare to attempt.Though the script is adapted from Walter Isaacsons book it feels more like a play that director Danny Boyle has transferred to the screen. The stage must be the true home of ""Steve Jobs""; no one steps outside until a pivotal moment late in the film.Like the tightly controlled aesthetics of Jobs himself the movie is a closed system. Even in the first scenes Jobs is trying to have the ""Exit"" signs covered for the show. Tell the fire marshals he says ""Were in here changing the world.""Cloistered inside its claustrophobic casing the movie hums with the high processing capacity of Sorkins dialogue. In dressing rooms and the bowels of theaters Jobs flanked by his right-hand woman Joanna Hoffman (an excellent Kate Winslet) is the egomaniacal mind amid the media storm of his making.Hes in virtually perpetual argument strong-arming his engineers to get the first Mac to say ""Hello"" in his presentation; lamenting a Time magazine cover that dared to make the computer not him man of the year; sneering at PC ""hobbyists"" who resist the ""end-to-end"" control he demands for the Mac.What does Steve Jobs do? Thats the question Wozniak (the arguably more important inventor and computer programmer) puts to him and the one the film itself is an answer to. Jobs is the big-picture visionary the bullheaded narcissist and above all the knowing conductor of talent and ideas. Its not a hard metaphor to grasp by the way Sorkin the master of multitasking juggles Jobs in an asteroid storm of turmoil including oh yes one scene set in an orchestra pit.Every interaction bears the tension of tolerance How much do we accept from a man of some genius? Its not much fun being around a guy who compares himself to Julius Caesar and sees assassins all around. How to reconcile someone who can refuse to pay for his daughters college tuition but who can like magic put a thousand songs in her pocket?Hes as puny as he is mighty a flawed man who made perfect machines.""Steve Jobs"" hangs heavily melodramatically on his relationship with Lisa. But as fraught as life is backstage the thundering foot-stopping audiences lurk outside.Why has Sorkin an acknowledged technology neophyte who also penned ""The Social Network"" become the go-to for some of the greatest tech minds of our time? Perhaps because his rat-tat-tat exchanges gives us some sense of the computing power of elite minds just as his morality tales render them in the binary codes of good and bad rather than ones and zeroes.Boyle whose greatest talent is in his slick manipulation of time (""127 Hours"" 28 Days Later..."") is in firm control of the screenplays high-velocity rhythm. And he does his best to bring a visual component to the stagy screenplay most notably filming each act different first grainy 16mm then 35mm and finally in the hard reality of high-definition digital.The adventurous Boyle feels a little hemmed in here as does the naturally mischievous Fassbender. But Fassbender captures the thin-skinned sensitivity and detailed obsessiveness of Jobs. In his hands Sorkins dialogue crackles.The film often does too the Full Sorkin Treatment has electrified a well-trod subject. But it also smothers it in artifice.

EntertainmentMovies Michael Fassbender makes a brilliant Steve Jobs Originally published October 15 2015 at 300 pm Updated October 15 2015 at 236 pm Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslet have great chemistry in ""Steve Jobs."" (Photo Credit Franois Duhamel) Movie review of ""Steve Jobs"" Michael Fassbender gives a breathtakingly intense portrayal of the late Apple magnate. Rating 4 stars out of 4. Share story By Soren AndersenSeattle Times movie reviewer A hurricane. A hurricane of words pouring off the screen in ""Steve Jobs."" Words delivered with breathtaking intensity by Michael Fassbender in the title role. The words written by Aaron Sorkin and delivered by Fassbender define Jobs as brilliant egomaniacal intensely focused and cruel. And one more thing unceasingly fascinating. Fassbender may not look like Jobs and certainly Sorkin and director Danny Boyle (""Slumdog Millionaire"") have taken liberties with the facts of the late Apple magnates life. Boyle himself has conceded this in an interview in which he said Sorkin envisioned the picture as an ""impressionistic portrait"" made up of events some real some imagined. Thats the nature of biopics. Movie Review    Steve Jobs with Michael Fassbender Kate Winslet Jeff Daniels Seth Rogen. Directed by Danny Boyle from a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin. 122 minutes. Rated R for language. Several theaters. What raises ""Steve Jobs"" way above the level of most biopics is the totality of Fassbenders immersion into the character creating the portrait of a flawed and driven man whose sheer forcefulness of will is such that no one with whom he interacts can diminish his single-minded focus on getting what he wants in almost every situation.

Liberally employing flashbacks the major issues in Jobs life are deftly revealed. Fassbenders performance stands out but the other actors come close to rising to his level. Jeff Daniels as Apple CEO John Sculley and Seth Rogen as Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak do fine work as two men who come into conflict with Jobs and come out losers. Only Macintosh marketing chief Joanna Hoffman consistently stands up to him and in that role Kate Winslet is terrific fearlessly pushing back and calling Jobs out on his often heartless behavior especially toward his daughter Lisa whom he repeatedly refuses to acknowledge as his child though she is. The snap-crackling interplay of Fassbender and Winslet is the heart of ""Steve Jobs.""

Its a portrait not a picture and its entertaining and revealing.Still from ""Steve Jobs"" starring Michael Fassbender(Photo Universal Pictures)Story HighlightsCritics rating 4.5 stars out of 5Michael Fassbender is outstanding though he looks nothing like Steve Jobs.The acting is superb and the film is remarkably entertaining.A couple of questions came to mind during ""Steve Jobs"" Danny Boyles go-for-broke film about the late Apple wizard famously (infamously?) known for embracing the cold certainty of technology more eagerly than the unpredictable nature of human relationships.First Did Steve Jobs really change the world?Second If it was considered a conflict of interest for every film critic who used Apple products to write a review of the movie would any be written at all?Maybe the second question helps answer the first. There are still 24 hours in a day and the Earth keeps turning but its not hyperbole to say that Jobs and his companys product helped change the world -- or at least define the modern version of it. If you dont have an iPhone or an iPod or some other Apple product you know someone who does. You probably also know someone who knows more about technology than you do who insists that the similar product made by (insert competitors name here) is better than the one Apple is selling.And you buy Apple anyway.Why? Because Apple is for lack of a better term a cult. And Jobs difficult as he could be was its unquestioned leader (except for the time covered in the film when he wasnt). Boyles film creative and fast-paced tries to get at what made him both so visionary and such a jerk -- more the latter than the former -- and does so in a non-traditional structure. Working from Aaron Sorkins typically verbose script the film examines Jobs life not in personal milestones but in three product launches.How appropriate.The first takes place in 1984 a couple of days after the famous ""1984"" Super Bowl commercial. Jobs (Michael Fassbender tremendous) is about to launch the Macintosh personal computer. But he is beset by distractions. The computer in tests wont say ""Hello"" a stunt crucial to the launch at least in Jobs mind. He berates Andy Hertzfeld (Michael Stuhlbarg) into fixing it driving his aide Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet) crazy in the process.More concerning is the appearance of his ex-girlfriend Chrisann Brennan (Katherine Waterson) along with Lisa the 5-year-old (played at different stages by Makenzie Moss Ripley Sobo and Perla Haney-Jardine) the daughter Jobs refuses to claim as his. In fact when a court-ordered paternity test that found with 94 percent certainty that Lisa was he came up with an algorithm to show there was a 28 percent chance she wasnt saying so in a Time interview and making Brennan look like a slut in the process.Brennan wants money -- Jobs is worth 400 million at this point and she and Lisa are about to go on welfare. This begins the first of the contentious battles that will mark each product launch -- the ill-fated (by design in this telling) NeXT computer in 1988 and the iMac in 1998. At each Jobs is visited by the same group of people Hertzfeld; John Sculley (Jeff Daniels) the executive who Jobs lured to Apple and would at least help engineer Jobs exit; and Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen) the brilliant engineer who cooked up the personal computer in a garage with Jobs and whose contributions Jobs downplayed over the years.And Brennan and Lisa.AZCENTRALList of movies opening in fall 2015Wozniak each time wants one thing recognition of the Apple II team. It was for a long time the one product Apple sold that actually made a profit. It was also one that Jobs didnt have a hand in and perhaps more crucially the only one that didnt work as a closed system. You could modify it. It played well with others.Guess who didnt want that.The acting is superb no easy feat when trying to recite Sorkins words while walking down seemingly endless hallways. Fassbender doesnt look a thing like Jobs and it doesnt matter a bit. He inhabits the persona at least the one we know about (Sorkin based his script on Walter Isaacsons authorized biography). Rogen brings a sweet naivete to Wozniak that eventually becomes laced with righteous anger. Daniels and Winslet get at the cool competence of their characters.AZCENTRALSteve Jobs (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsBoyle as he always does brings his own busy visual language to the film lots of angled shots rich textures and the occasional special effect that is more about illustrating than wowing (like when a Jobs speech about Skylab takes place in front of a projected image of the rocket on the wall behind him).The film takes liberties with the real history and thats no more important than Fassbenders lack of resemblance to Jobs himself. What Boyle and Sorkin are after here is a portrait of Jobs not a photograph. And they have succeeded in making one in wildly entertaining fashion.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint The clever compelling biopic ""Steve Jobs"" transforms the folklore surrounding the late co-founder and CEO of Apple Inc. to fuel a magical mystery tour of three pivotal events in his life. Each breakneck act follows Jobs as he readies a different product launch over the course of 15 years. Scenes of anxious backstage preparations bubble with Silicon Valley tech jargon as Jobs gets ready to introduce the Macintosh computer in 1984 then the NeXT cube he introduced after leaving Apple in 1988 and finally the iMac after his return in 1998. The film evolves through a trio of visual formats across that time-traveling structure shot in granular 16mm film for the opening act progressing to gleaming 35mm and climaxing in sleek high-definition digital. Masterfully directed by Danny Boyle the story boils with in-the-wings turmoil like ""Birdman"" ""The Artist"" and ""Love amp; Mercy."" Each scene is a crescendo of aggressive arguments. The uber-controlling boss orders his battered burned-out employees to about-face in ways they consider impossible. ""Its like five minutes before a launch everybody goes to a bar and gets drunk and tells me what they really think"" the disputatious Jobs complains. But the guiding subtext of Aaron Sorkins hyper-verbose script and Michael Fassbenders magnetic performance owning every single scene as Jobs isnt corporate stage jitters. Its Jobs slipshod relationship with a visitor to each of the publicity events -- his out-of-wedlock daughter Lisa. The story carries us from the neglectful era when Jobs denied the young girls paternity and unwillingly paid a court-ordered pittance of child support to a grudging latter-day teenage reconciliation. Universal Michael Fassbender is ""Steve Jobs."" Its really a psychological docudrama about a man with a faulty emotional operating system. Fassbender plays him as a perfectionist in everything except human connections at a time when the world falls in love with him. Sorkins signature fast-paced walk and talks and snarky jokes are rocketing here in hyperdrive. While Jobs is the central focus of every moment there are half a dozen demanding roles in the mix. Macintosh development lead Andy Hertzfeld (""A Serious Mans"" Michael Stuhlbarg) is ordered by Jobs to make the verbally clumsy computer welcome the packed audience with a clear ""Hello"" in 30 minutes. ""Were not a pit crew at Daytona. This cant be fixed in seconds"" the harassed designer protests. To which Jobs replies ""You didnt have seconds. You had three weeks. The universe was created in a third of that time."" Hertzfeld fires back ""Well someday youll have to tell us how you did it."" Steve Wozniak the engineering mastermind who created Apples first breakthrough computers gets a shaggy milquetoast portrait from Seth Rogen. Though he tries to rise above sidekick status and talk Jobs down from his narcissistic heights each of his attempts slips a noose around his own neck. ""What do you do?"" Wozniak asks. ""Youre not an engineer. Youre not a designer. You cant put a hammer to a nail. I built the circuit board. The graphical interface was stolen. So how come 10 times in a day I read Steve Jobs is a genius? What do you do?"" ""Musicians play their instruments"" answers Jobs living as always several steps out of reality. ""I play the orchestra."" A different yet equally demanding relationship features Kate Winslet playing Joanna Hoffman who was marketing chief for the original Macintosh. Jobs beleaguered work wife defends him in every crisis. She is flabbergasted when shes ordered to bring him a new dress shirt minutes before he goes onstage. Ever loyal to the man she confesses to platonically love his Gal Friday complies even grabbing an iron to smooth the shirt before he slips it on. She finally stands up to Jobs rather than for him late in the story. Grayer and bespectacled Jobs is still waging war on his daughter Lisa now a Harvard student until Hoffman aims an ultimatum of her own against him. While Winslet mismanages the Polish immigrants accent in several scenes she never misses the womans soul. Like his other alienated colleagues she is proof of Wozniaks belief that ""Its not binary. You can be decent and gifted at the same time."" Throughout the story Jobs is in serious need of a spiritual software update. This is an impressive companion piece to Sorkins Oscar-winning screenplay for ""The Social Network"" his caustic portrait of Facebook head Mark Zuckerberg. Once again it gives us a whirligig of infotainment. Its factually flawed but hits the essential target like a marksman. Like Jobs own legendary ""reality distortion field"" his near-mystical ability to convince anyone of almost anything the film lifts us past sheer realism to higher truth. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Comments (1) click to enlarge Steve Jobs Video Rated R  122 minutes  2015 Aaron Sorkins fictionalized screenplay about the tech guru behind Apple boils his life down into three product launches--for the Macintosh in 1984 the NeXT in 1988 (created after the board of Apple forced him out) and the iMac in 1998 (created after his triumphant return to the company). Throughout these episodes Sorkin peddles the dualistic take on Jobs--part visionary part ice-cold SOB--thats become conventional wisdom since his death in 2011 and focuses on his difficult relationships with programmer Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen) software designer Andy Hertzfeld (Michael Stuhlbarg) Apple CEO John Sculley (Jeff Daniels) and Lisa Brennan-Jobs the biological daughter Jobs refused to acknowledge for years. As the title character Michael Fassbender gets the SOB part down just fine but theres little evidence of the personal magnetism that enabled Jobs to bend so many people to his will.

Steve Jobs the film is also complicated -- and consistently thrilling for audiences who want to share in the tumultuous story of an American who exerted a profound influence on how we conduct our lives in the digital age. This is one of the best pure films of 2015 a worthy companion piece to David Finchers The Social Network the 2010 film that chronicled the rise of Facebook. Like The Social Network was in its year Steve Jobs will be a slam-dunk major player in the Oscar race with nominations guaranteed for the film as best picture for German-born London-based actor Michael Fassbender as best actor in the title role for Danny Boyle (of Slumdog Millionaire fame) as best director and for Aaron Sorkin for writing the best adapted screenplay. While supporting noms are harder to predict now the stellar ensemble cast behind Fassbender matches his physical and emotional brilliance. Steve Jobs is elevated to greatness with Kate Winslet as Jobs right-hand woman Joanna Hoffman Seth Rogen as Apples sometimes confounded co-founder Steve Wozniak Jeff Daniels as one-time Apple CEO John Sculley Katherine Waterston as Jobs estranged lover and single mom Chrisann Brennan and superb character actor Michael Stuhlbarg as original Mac team member Andy Hertzfeld. These are all real-life characters from Jobs life from the 1970s through the launch of the iMac in 1998. On the technical side the film editing by Elliot Graham is a work of kinetic moving art while Daniel Pembertons musical score and Alwin H. Kuchlers cinematography are both world class. What all this means is that the story of Jobs is compelling and Boyles cinema is a master class in how to turn a biographical picture into an enthralling experience. That rarely happens at least at this level with a biopic. Not even when the film is meticulously researched and acted with dedication. In a recent example of the pitfalls Steven Spielbergs thoughtful Lincoln with Daniel Day-Lewis in the title role of Abraham Lincoln was a historical snorefest even though Day-Lewis Oscar went on to win the best actor Oscar as the title character. For the film Steve Jobs audiences are fortunate the project fell into the hands of writer Aaron Sorkin during its convoluted path from Walter Isaacsons authorized biography to Boyles explosive biopic. Sorkin won an Oscar for adapting The Social Network delicately dancing through time periods to juxtapose events that illuminated the characters inner lives. Sorkin does the same thing with Steve Jobs building the narrative around three major product launches that showcase how Jobs came to be so influential even when his personal life was a shambles. Significantly because the story ends in 1998 Steve Jobs the film is not sentimental. Jobs own life ended on Oct. 5 2011 when he died of cancer at 56. Jobs roles in Pixar Animation Studios and The Walt Disney Company (after a Pixar-Disney merger) are never discussed. Nor does this later period need to be here. The point of Steve Jobs as cinema is to bring us face-to-face with the humanity behind technology that we now take for granted. Remember this when considering whether you should bother seeing Boyles film Just as with Facebook the eccentric idiosyncratic and opportunistic ways that major shifts take place in society start with individual people such as Steve Jobs. Geniuses are not necessarily nice people. Jobs was as arrogant as he was creative; he was verbally abusive to colleagues; and his personal life was a twisted psychological mess as Boyles film demonstrates in exploring Jobs background and how he infamously denied paternity for his first child Lisa Brennan-Jobs. Fassbender stripping away his own German-Irish heritage and London accent delivers this version of Steve Jobs in what appears to be a truthful manner -- and he ingeniously makes him appealing and approachable as that complicated human being. This sleight-of-hand is one more reason why Steve Jobs the film is so absorbing and so moving.

(Nicki DeMarco and Michael OSullivan/The Washington Post) Michael Fassbender who plays Steve Jobs in the movie ""Steve Jobs"" looks nothing like Steve Jobs. And thats a good thing. Rather than a literalistic rehash of the life and career of the man behind the Apple personal computing empire ""Steve Jobs"" creates an impressionistic inner portrait a Shakespearean character study in three tautly constructed acts in which Jobss contradictions demons and most searing primal wounds are revealed in constantly peeling layers. Unburdened by the distraction of spot-on impersonation and conventional Great Man milestones Fassbender and his fascinating often off-putting character steer clear of the dreaded biopic shallows to explore murkier psychological depths. Propelled by an ingenious script by Aaron Sorkin given vibrance and buoyancy by director Danny Boyle ""Steve Jobs"" is a galvanizing viewing experience. Its perhaps the closest thing to the thrilling immediacy of live theater that audiences can get at the multiplex right now. Sorkin -- best known as the creator of ""The West Wing"" and for his screenplay for ""The Social Network"" -- is famous for his crackling dialogue which harks back to Hollywoods rat-a-tat-tat Golden Age and is usually delivered by way of breathless circuitous walk-and-talks. That exuberant musicality is on full display in ""Steve Jobs"" but Sorkins real breakthrough here is with structure. The movie takes place in three discrete 40-minute chapters each of which finds Jobs on the verge of presenting one of his signature products. Transpiring virtually in real time these moments work on a number of levels equally effectively When Jobs welcomes colleagues and well-wishers (and some not-so-well-wishers) from his past Sorkins script is able to revisit all manner of biographical material without dreary exposition or billboard scenes. Throughout ""Steve Jobs"" Jobss colleagues observe that hes not an engineer or a designer. Instead he was a synthesizer someone who deployed those disciplines to create devices that werent just functional but lovable. Here we see what drove that single-minded focus and glimpse the enigma beneath the carefully cultivated persona. Rather than the boyish bow-tied nerd and later the Zenned-out turtleneck-wearing philosopher king the movies Jobs is arrogant petty insecure and perpetually enraged just as hes utterly confident that hes on the cusp of changing the world. Of course hes right -- but he doesnt know that yet in 1984 when two days after the revolutionary ad for the Macintosh ran during the Super Bowl hes launching the machine itself. Arguing with longtime friend and Apple co-founder Steve ""Woz"" Wozniak (Seth Rogen) and marketing chief Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet adopting a note-perfect Polish accent) Jobs obsesses over whether the computer onstage will be able to say ""Hello."" Kate Winslet as Joanna Hoffman and Michael Fassbender as Steve Jobs in ""Steve Jobs."" (Francois Duhamel/Universal Pictures) Through his bullying back-and-forths and a few brief flashbacks -- all staged against the ticking-clock deadline of showtime -- one of the films central conceits is established To Wozniaks chagrin Jobs always insisted on ""end-to-end control"" for his machines meaning they wouldnt be able to communicate with other systems or be customized by their users. But he adamantly insisted that they be warm and friendly the antidote to years of Hollywood demonizing computers as HAL-like malignancies and just perhaps the antidote to his own demons. When new Apple CEO John Sculley (Jeff Daniels) shows up to calm Jobs with a glass of wine he traces Jobss spiky personality to having been adopted as a baby asking him why he views adoption as being rejected rather than selected. Jobs dismisses the question out of hand. ""Its the loss of control"" he insists quietly. Jobs doesnt harbor unresolved feelings just regarding his biological parents but also about his own role as a father. In each chapter of ""Steve Jobs"" which jumps to product launches for the NeXT Computer in 1988 and the iMac a decade later hes confronted by sometimes-angry friends and business associates as well as the daughter he had with his now-estranged girlfriend Chrisann Brennan (Katherine Waterston). Jobss fractured relationship with that daughter Lisa forms the emotional fulcrum of ""Steve Jobs"" -- which from its backstage perch offers starkly candid examples of the protagonists shocking lack of empathy even as he strives to create the worlds most intuitive machine. While Jobs stresses about sales figures refuses Wozs pleas to give a shout-out to the engineers who worked on the Apple II (which Jobs came to despise) shouts orders at beleaguered employees desperately trying to please him and turns on the charm for a visiting reporter he treats Lisa with breathtaking cruelty initially denying that shes his daughter and -- only eventually -- tentatively allowing her into his life. 1 of 62 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad x Four-star movies View Photos Caption Captain Fantastic Viggo Mortensen stars as a father raising six children in the forest in ""Captain Fantastic.""

Cathy Kanavy/Bleecker Street Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. With such a tetchy self-absorbed control freak at its center its difficult to explain just why ""Steve Jobs"" is as entertaining even pleasurable as it is. Even the finer points of fonts motherboard expansion slots and corporate intrigue take on the soaring dimensions of a socio-historical epic. A large part of the credit goes to Fassbender and his co-stars who turn Sorkins mannered spoken arias into conversational convincingly intimate chamber pieces. Boyle infuses the production with characteristic visual verve such as the clever change of formats between each section (from grainy 16mm film to classical 35mm and finally to digital) the cameras moves that follow Jobss predatory path and at one point the bits of video collage illustrating a self-important speech about the space program. ""Steve Jobs"" unfolds at such breakneck pace with such densely layered meanings and metaphors that viewers have little chance to decide whether they buy what is essentially a reductive psycho-biography of a man who was surely propelled by a complicated and constantly changing skein of motivations impulses and ambitions. Perhaps the most insightful observation is never explicitly expressed in ""Steve Jobs"" which is his indelible impact as a social engineer. By embedding products with his deepest flaws and highest aspirations Jobs wound up exporting those qualities to his customers creating a generation thats simultaneously hyper-connected and alarmingly detached. Jobss devices have brought the universe into our pockets but they have made our immediate world a far less warm and interesting place. Avoiding one another behind screens we can friend strangers one minute and bark out an angry tweet the next when they fail to conform to our exacting standards. The unchecked hubris that drives ""Steve Jobs"" is often unpleasant even repellent to behold. But even at his most overbearingly godlike the films protagonist might have been on to something Theres a little bit of Steve Jobs in all of us now. R.

"Steve Jobs review Troubled genius wired for success - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Steve Jobs review Backstage with a beleaguered genius Steve Jobs AP Michael Fassbender stars as Steve Jobs in a scene from ""Steve Jobs."" Michael Fassbender stars as Steve Jobs in a scene from ""Steve Jobs."" (AP) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Reports of screenwriter Aaron Sorkins ""daring"" biopic are greatly exaggerated. ""Steve Jobs"" a dazzling shell of a biopic from screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and director Danny Boyle is a three-act backstage drama about a bullying insecure overbearing visionary who learns to be a better father and less of a jerk in the nick of time. His products may be the ones on which youre reading this review right now. In the films eyes that fact exonerates him from the other messier stuff.The last 10 minutes of the movie are bad in a cushy sentimental way that may help ""Steve Jobs"" find a wide popular audience in addition to its inevitable Oscar nominations. Much of what precedes the third act percolates nicely with one good actor after another starting with Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslet happily chewing away on the granola bars of Sorkins dialogue. It takes a while to notice whats not there and to suss out the peculiar mixture of finger-pointing and genuflection in the films attitude toward Jobs himself. Act 1 shot on high-grain 16 millimeter film by cinematographer Alwin Kuchler takes place in 1984. Jobs is about to launch the Macintosh personal computer at a Cupertino Calif. community college. His surly ex-girlfriend Chrisann Brennan (Katherine Waterston misdirected into a perpetual rage) and her 5-year-old daughter (Makenzie Moss) whose paternity Jobs denies find themselves a few steps from welfare.Brennan has come at this dramatically opportune time to ask for a bump in child support. Meanwhile Macintosh marketing wizard Joanna Hoffman (Winslet) Jobs de facto stage manager and resident truth-teller hovers with a clipboard and a knack for undoing the damage done by Jobs every human interaction. She loves the man for his genius. Sorkins script loosely based on Walter Isaacsons biography has no interest in completism; it telescopes and compresses and leaves things out such as the cancer that ultimately claimed his life. Act 2 shot on gleaming 35mm 1988 Jobs has been summarily bounced from Apple. Backstage at the San Francisco Opera House hes readying the launch of an ill-fated overpriced but strategically shrewd computer called the NeXT Cube from his new company. Apple will need the operating system; Jobs knows the Cube wont sell but its his leverage with the people who didnt believe in him sufficiently among them Apple CEO John Sculley (Jeff Daniels). As in the first section of ""Steve Jobs"" Jobs friend and colleague Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen excellent in a one-and-a-half-note role) comes around to press for recognition of the Apple II team something Jobs resists. Jobs daughter now 9 and played by Ripley Sobo is an eerily eloquent sprite dying for affection and some attention from her dad. Steve Jobs is a new kind of biopic -- and not entirely true Steven Zeitchik Early in the new movie ""Steve Jobs"" the title character absorbs a verbal sting from fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak who accuses Jobs of being a glorified marketer.

Early in the new movie ""Steve Jobs"" the title character absorbs a verbal sting from fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak who accuses Jobs of being a glorified marketer. ""I read Steve Jobs is a genius. What do you do?"" Wozniak says to him angrily. The sight of one of the worlds most famous... (Steven Zeitchik) The third act jumps ahead a decade and is photographed digitally with clean sharp lines. Were backstage at San Franciscos Davies Symphony Hall. The usual suspects including a figure of conscience Mac collaborator Andy Hertzfeld (Michael Stuhlbarg) return for a final reckoning to discuss finances betrayals grudges and Jobs failings of character. The guru at the shiny center of ""Steve Jobs"" has one way of dealing with any threat to his loss of control over any situation He wires money at the problem before shutting down emotionally.But daughter Lisa (Perla Haney-Jardine plays the 19-year-old edition) calls him on his issues at long last. This is just after Daniels Sculley returns to discuss the Freudian implications of Jobs own adoptive childhood. Chagrined yet godlike Jobs is sent off by director Boyle into a bath of glorious white light to a promised land of iMacs iPods iPhones and the rest shining like the spotless glass windows of an Apple store just before opening.

Jobs accomplishments are fantastic of course and omnipresent and they did change the world. But having seen ""Steve Jobs"" twice now Id like to ask Sorkin what he really thinks of the man. Sorkins equally ambitious but far wittier script for ""The Social Network"" was infinitely tougher on its subject Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. Im not sure thats why that film ended up stronger and more clear-eyed than ""Steve Jobs"" but with this one -- which cares no more for biographical facts than ""The Social Network"" -- Sorkins exchanges often go nowhere floridly. Fans of the whole truth and nothing but the truth (count me out) will freak out about the biopic liberties taken. I didnt care about that part at least until the final scene in which Jobs and his Harvard daughter reconcile over dads promise to invent the iPod someday soon. At the time Jobs was married with three more children and Lisa had lived with her dad for several of her teen years. Whatever; Sorkin owes no one the facts simply his own idea of what makes a compelling fictionalized version of Steve Jobs.The dialogue has a theatrical zing at its best; at its weakest the thesis lines regarding Jobs need for ""end-to-end control"" in every aspect of his life and his product line get a little thick. ""Go make a dent in the universe Steven"" whispers Winslet at one point. Jobs did but lines like that dont help anybodys cause. The movie a formidable technical and design achievement has everything going for it except a sense of Jobs inner life. On the other hand with a charismatic actor on the order of Fassbender staring off into the middle distance in between hissy fits communing with the gods of tech and commerce the whirligig of an outer life may be enough.Phillips is a Tribune critic.mjphillipstribpub.comTwitter phillipstribune""Steve Jobs"" -- 2.5 starsMPAA rating R (for language)Running time 202Opens Thursday evening Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Steve Jobs Crimson Peak review Haunting but hollow Beasts of No Nation review Captivating story of a child soldier Live blog Lollapalooza day three Lollapalooza day two Major Lazer loses power Radiohead closes the night Lollapalooza day one Lana del Reys anti-charisma J.

By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 1200am on Thursday Oct. 15 2015 Thursday Oct. 15 2015 Thursday Oct. 15 2015 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Whether you like Steve Jobs or not will have less to do with the man who gave us the iPhone and more to do with your feelings on Aaron Sorkin the films celebrated screenwriter. Sorkin ( The Newsroom The Social Network The West Wing) revels in his style in Steve Jobs a Sorkin sundae of glib rat-a-tat-tat conversations that sound little like the way real people speak. Its all topped off by the cherry of an electric performance from Michael Fassbender who beautifully captures the Apple founders diffident persona. Steve Jobs based on Walter Isaacsons book of the same name largely takes place in the moments just prior to several important Apple product launches in the 80s and 90s. While the locations change all have the feel of being backstage before the big show. At each event Jobs is confronted by his past in the form of his former girlfriend Chrisann (Katherine Waterston) and their daughter Lisa (Makenzie Moss Ripley Sobo Perla Haney-Jardine at various ages) whom Jobs claims isnt his. Theres also his Apple business partner Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen) his mentor John Sculley (Jeff Daniels) engineer Andy Hertzfeld (Michael Stuhlbarg) and his loyal assistant Johanna (Kate Winslet). Each forces him to deal with some ugly truth and boy is there a lot of ugly to go around.Its a clever conceit that lifts Steve Jobs from being just another biopic. While the static nature of the setting and emphasis on dialogue theoretically constrains director Danny Boyle whose films often have a wonderful sense of movement he proves he can make the most of tight spaces as he did in 127 Hours. The result is that Steve Jobs sometimes feels like Birdman lifted from Broadway and set down in the Bay Area.While Fassbender is getting much of the glory and Oscar buzz Rogen deserves recognition too. As Wozniaks meetings with Jobs become increasingly testy ultimately exploding in a shower of acrimony Rogen shows he can be much more than just a foul-mouthed goofball.Still Steve Jobs doesnt dig much beyond the surface of the man in the title. Anyone who wants a fuller story free from the heavy hand of Sorkin should seek out Alex Gibneys documentary from earlier this year Steve Jobs The Man in the Machine.

""Steve Jobs"" with Michael Fassbender as the father of the Mac computer overplays the story line with daughter Lisa. Photo Francois Duhamel McClatchy-Tribune News Service Steve Jobs launches the Apple guy as an entertaining jerk 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Its quite possible that Steve Jobs was a jerk but its hard to imagine he was precisely the kind of jerk that we find in ""Steve Jobs."" In this imaginative riff directed by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin as a kind of three-act play Jobs is relentlessly unpleasant unreachable and uninspiring not a visionary so much as a sleek nasty businessman -- but hes entertaining. He is always entertaining. In ""Steve Jobs"" the screenwriters signature is as obvious as in a Preston Sturges or Woody Allen film. The characters all sound exactly as if theyre in an Aaron Sorkin movie pingponging wisecracks pithy observations and casual but devastatingly accurate putdowns and to say that this is anything less than delightful would be churlish. In its 122 minutes ""Steve Jobs"" is never a great film but it never becomes tiresome. When the soundtrack pumps up to tell us that its about to end it leaves the audience wanting more. The film takes place on three different days Jobs product launches in 1984 1988 and 1998 and aside from very brief flashbacks -- literally just a flash here and there -- the film stays contained playing out in real time within each act. Jobs (Michael Fassbender) moves restlessly from room to room steamrolling and threatening people (never charming them) as the important figures from his life turn up to be abused ask for favors or tell him off. More from Mick La Salle Spielbergs Bridge of Spies is much more than a solid ride Freeheld a lesbian romance that led to a 2006 court case Ask Mick LaSalle Are some novels unfilmable? Inexplicably bad Pan not winning any fans Actually sooner or later everyone gets to do all three. Theres Apple CEO John Sculley (Jeff Daniels) trying to put lightning in a bottle as Jobs boss; Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen) the technical brain behind the home computer who tells Jobs that he is tired of being thought of as Ringo when he is really John; and Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet) his marketing director and the closest thing he has to a friend. The movie tries to locate its heart in Jobs relationship with his out-of-wedlock daughter Lisa (played at different ages by different actresses). He starts off rejecting her and denying his paternity in a callous way but gradually thaws at least somewhat. Actually the movie does find its way to some emotion through this strain but Sorkin and Boyle overplay it by trying to make it the movies overarching story the emblem of its heros personal progress over 14 years. They cant succeed because theres neither enough drama nor transformation in the relationship but also because the audiences interest is limited. Wed rather know abut the guy who invented the iPod. As Jobs Fassbender is fine on his terms as the embodiment of Sorkins vision. Hes quick brilliant and impervious and the matinee-idol looks dont hurt. Just breezing through the room his Jobs is an impressive man. What he lacks is the thing that the film probably didnt need but that the real Steve Jobs did need and had. Fassbender isnt endearing. Hes not someone you love in spite of yourself. Hes not boyish and charming. Ashton Kutcher playing the same role in a lesser movie (""Jobs"" from 2013) had these qualities. He made you understand why people bothered to put up with him. By contrast people put up with Fassbenders Jobs because hes the boss or because like Hoffman they like him for inexplicable reasons. Some of the best scenes take place between Jobs and Wozniak who are more like McCartney and Lennon than they realize with each possessing necessary qualities that the other lacks and each both resenting and loving the other guy for it. Rogen conveys a sweetness of nature and a forgiving awareness of Jobs strengths and weaknesses while Fassbender looks at him as though he were some piece of ungainly but essential equipment best kept under a drape. At one point in passing he refers to him as Rain Man. Boyle films the proceedings on a slightly grainy stock that gives the movie just the hint of a documentary. Theres propulsion and energy. He takes Sorkins script and pumps it with amphetamines. The movies biggest weakness is that it ends too soon. ""Steve Jobs"" is the second Jobs film to not include its inventors great 21st century innovations the iPod the iPhone and the iPad. To be sure ""Steve Jobs"" has its own integrity as the story of the young innovator but its a little like making a movie about Thomas Edison and stopping somewhere between the phonograph and the lightbulb.

"Review Steve Jobs does justice to its iconic subject - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Steve Jobs does justice to its iconic subjectBy Tony Hicksthicksbayreanewsgroup.comPosted 10/14/2015 111001 AM PDTUpdated 10/16/2015 022402 PM PDT Related StoriesOct 10With Steve Jobs Aaron Sorkin returns to Silicon Valley for his second tech titan takedown. Who will be next?Throughout director Danny Boyles ""Steve Jobs"" biopic the famed Apple co-founder (Michael Fassbender) trumpets each new product launch as a profound moment in history. While Jobs was too complex and iconic to be judged merely by his massive ego -- he did after all help revolutionize technology --its understandable to be wary of a movie seemingly obsessed with portraying him as a cultural messiah.Then the movie ends -- and everyone in the theater fires up their iPhone.So yes Jobs matters that much even to those of us who dont ordinarily think of him that way or who view technology as a necessity rather than a passion. The fact that you understand this when ""Steve Jobs"" is over is one of the best indicators of how good the movie is and of how well Boyle and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin have done their jobs. Michael Fassbender as Steve Jobs in Steve Jobs. (Universal Studios) ( Universal Studios ) Is it accurate? No and many involved have gone on record to confirm that including Sorkin who won an Oscar for his take on Silicon Valley culture in ""The Social Network"" and is well-known for constructing stories that line up more with his artistic vision than with reality. In ""Jobs"" adapted from Walter Isaacsons acclaimed biography he and Boyle have set out to capture the essence of their subject rather than the factual details of his life. And even this is inconclusive Toward the end the filmmakers move Jobs darker character issues to the side and a more sympathetic even heroic man emerges.Advertisement The tightly shot fast-paced film is set in three acts each peppered with necessary flashbacks built around Jobs first three big product unveilings so what we get is three days in a life spread out over 14 years. Brilliantly each is filmed using the technology of the period evoking its essence in a visceral way. In each of the three acts somehow Jobs most meaningful personal clashes and ideological battles come to a head just hours before the rollout. At one point after a heated exchange with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen) in front of a few dozen employees and hangers-on Jobs remarks that it seems like everyone in his life stops at a bar on the way to his events to get juiced up for a confrontation. The first 30-minute sequence (shot in 16 mm) takes place in 1984 just before the rock starlike Jobs introduces the world to the Macintosh at Cupertinos Flint Center (where the scene was filmed). From the get-go we see Sorkins influence with characters in constant motion dispensing smart snappy dialogue. Watching Fassbender I couldnt help but have flashbacks of Bradley Whitfords Josh Lyman in ""The West Wing."" The films main conflicts are established early Jobs fathered a child he rejects; his all-or-nothing drive alienates those he needs most even if they somehow remain loyal to him; and he is still dealing with being rejected by his own birth parents. How Jobs deals with each situation shows the resilience of a man destined to be important. Fassbender offers a fascinating all-consuming and brilliant portrayal even if he doesnt start resembling Jobs until Act 3 in 1998 (shot digitally) when he rolls out the iMac.In what might be his Jonah Hill crossover performance Rogen is a pleasant surprise as Wozniak who functions as Jobs conscience and may be the only person able to cut through his intimidating aura. The powerful exchanges between the two reveal a complex relationship and rate among the best scenes in the movie.Kate Winslet plays Jobs loyal PR person Joanna Hoffman with a supposed Polish accent thats either subtle or occasionally forgotten. Hoffman is Jobs classic ""work wife"" the pained assistant who stays with him after his dismissal from Apple through his formation of NeXT (which is portrayed rather cynically in the film with a Skylab analogy but makes Jobs seem even more of a genius) and his Phoenix-is-rising retaking of Apple. Instead of having a devil on one shoulder and an angel on the other Jobs needs two angels -- Wozniak and Hoffman. While Wozniaks presence reminds the audience that Apple wasnt a one-man show and provides a humane contrast to Jobs frequent harshness Hoffman eventually becomes the healer in Jobs tortured relationship with daughter Lisa which like much of Jobs life according to the movie was complicated.Jeff Daniels lends passion as former Apple CEO John Sculley whom Jobs hand-picked to be Apples CEO and who winds up firing him. As Jobs father figure Sculley is the catalyst for exploring Jobs childhood issues which may have indeed been relevant to his life but come across in the film as a cheap subplot thrown in to explain why this brilliant man so often comes off like a megalomaniacal jerk.Sorkin who is arguably the real star of this project injects some humanity into his protagonist by movies end -- though barely -- and manages in two hours to offer insight into the man as well as his massive impact on technology an influence that continues to shape our culture four years after his death. So is ""Steve Jobs"" the final say on Steve Jobs? Thats hard to say. But like its subject it should remain relevant for years to come.Contact Tony Hicks at Facebook.com/BayAreaNewsGroup.TonyHicks or Twitter.com/tonyhicks67.Steve Jobs    1/2Rating R Cast Michael Fassbender Seth Rogen Kate Winslet Jeff Daniels Sarah Snook Michael StuhlbargDirector Danny BoyleRunning time 2 hours 2 minutesOpens In San Francisco only on Oct. 16 expanding to more theaters on Oct. 23Print Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Review Holocaust haunts family in The GatheringReview In Hearts of Palm bumbling corporation aims to plunder paradiseReview In Bad Moms fast food and booze spike the stress of motherhood Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

Steve Jobs (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Steve Jobs (R) Michael Fassbender stars as the revered CEO of Apple in Danny Boyles unusual biopic. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com10/14/2015 Editor rating 2.5 The enigma at the center of Steve Jobs is a man who intuitively knew what the world wanted yet was baffled by those closest to him He was good with people as long as he didnt have to deal with them. As played by Michael Fassbender who channels Jobs spirit instead of transforming himself into a look-alike the CEO of Apple Inc. was a stubborn defiant impertinent genius who demanded perfection and took offense at being questioned. He was a beloved public figure who was almost impossible to like one-on-one. Countless movies from Citizen Kane to Raging Bull have been based on the lives of extraordinary men cursed with faulty emotional wiring. But director Danny Boyle and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin using Walter Isaacsons authorized biography as a launching point arent interested in a traditional biopic. Steve Jobs which by many accounts plays loose with the facts is at its weakest when it tries to humanize its protagonist. The scenes between Jobs and his estranged daughter Lisa (played at different ages by Perla Haney-Jardine Ripley Sobo and Makenzie Moss) or her mother (Katherine Waterston) who had to beg Jobs to increase his monthly child support payments of 385 even though he was worth 441 million tilt the movie toward hagiography making Jobs a brusque man forced to learn how to love. When Jobs eyes Lisas clunky Walkman cassette player and promises hes going to design a machine that will let her carry thousands of songs in her pocket the scene makes you wince. Its too on-the-nose too aware of its own portent. The father-daughter relationship is the emotional center of Steve Jobs and its a dud as formulaic and out of place as the romantic subplots in the first season of The Newsroom before Sorkin righted the show and trimmed all the extraneous sops. Steve Jobs too fares much better when it focuses on the work because this is a case in which the work defined the man. The movie argues that a big part of Jobs genius was his sense of showmanship and that his enormous ego was both hindrance and boon He simply refused to be wrong even when he was. Steve Jobs is told in three acts roughly 40 minutes each set backstage before the unveiling of a new Apple product to an eager audience The Macintosh in 1984 the NeXT computer in 1988 and the iMac in 1998. The hows and whys behind each new presentation require a working knowledge of the complicated history between Jobs and Apple and its a testament to the mans legacy that much of this is already implanted in popular culture such as the famed TV commercial directed by Ridley Scott that aired nationally only once during the 1984 Super Bowl introducing the Macintosh without ever showing it. Introduced by a title card each segment catches Jobs putting out fires as he prepares to go onstage. Orbiting around him are his director of marketing Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet) who is as close to a friend as Jobs seems to have; Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen segueing nicely into drama much like his pal Jonah Hill) who created the influential Apple II computer and needles Jobs to give the original design team some credit; and John Sculley (Jeff Daniels) the former president of Pepsi who was Jobs boss and mentor for several years until he became his enemy. Each of the films thirds are shot on era-appropriate film stock (16mm 35mm and digital) and scored by Daniel Pemberton using different instruments -- 1980s synthesizers a full orchestra and for the final segment Apple music software. The technical stylings are subliminal -- some viewers may not even notice them -- but they are part of the considerable creativity Boyle brings to what is essentially two hours of people walking and talking. Boyle who managed to make the story of a man trapped in a crevice riveting in 127 Hours keeps his camera whirling and soaring to stave off stagnation. This is a grand-looking movie even if there isnt anything particularly grand taking place on the screen. Still Sorkins relentless chatter starts to weigh on you Steve Jobs feels artificial and conceptualized when it should be building to a crescendo. Near the end when Jobs wonders why five minutes before every launch everyone he knows seems to go to a bar get drunk and then come to tell him what theyre thinking the line lands like a great in-joke a wink to the viewer that yeah this is all a bit contrived. But it is also an acknowledgment that Steve Jobs is as much of a construct as the doomed NeXT cube. Sorkin cant carry out the central concept without occasionally resorting to flashbacks which feels like cheating. The movies secret weapon is Fassbender an actor who is quietly building an impressive filmography from X-Men pictures to 12 Years a Slave. As Jobs Fassbender keeps you invested Youre not quite sure what to make of this opaque fastidious man but youre fascinated by him - to a point Steve Jobs is much like its protagonist elusive yet taxing. It wears on you. The movie is to the more informative but conventional Jobs which starred Ashton Kutcher what the iMac is to those old gray IBM PCs A radical improvement on design and performance but a closed proprietary system with its own set of tics and peculiarities.

By Anthony Lane Michael Fassbender in a film written by Aaron Sorkin and directed by Danny Boyle.   Credit Illustration by Cun Shi The assumption behind ""Steve Jobs"" is that the launch of a new computer has the combined effect of a Mahler symphony a simultaneous orgasm and a personal visit from the angel Gabriel. This could well be true. Indeed so true is it to Apple users everywhere that the films director Danny Boyle and the screenwriter Aaron Sorkin have built their tale around not one but three separate launches first of the Macintosh in 1984; second of the NeXT cube whatever that was in 1988; and last--behold my people--of the iMac in 1998. Jobs is played by Michael Fassbender who sets out in a blue blazer and green bow tie and distills himself over time into the guru of legend complete with the monkish haircut and the black turtleneck. We also get brief occasional flashbacks to the younger Jobs when he was still just a hippie in a garage teamed with his pal Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen) and tinkering the notion of a personal computer into existence. (The seeping of West Coast counterculture into the zealotry of tech is a weird historical osmosis worthy of Thomas Pynchon though it is scarcely touched on here; nor is Jobss affair with Joan Baez.) The appearance of the movie is a kind of Apple-flavored homage shifting from grainy and homespun 16-mm. footage to a digital froideur as if the ghost of Jobs who died in 2011 were buffing the edges of the work that bears his name. The principal source of the film is the biography of Jobs by Walter Isaacson--an exemplary book not least because it keeps its head while all those whom it describes are losing theirs. That is not the attitude of Sorkin and Boyle who opt for what you might call expressionist compression. For instance Jobs had a child named Lisa born in 1978 and for years he struggled to admit openly that he was her father even after the case was proved by a paternity test. The saga is distressing and although it was peaceably resolved in the end it is still wielded as Exhibit A by anyone wishing to claim that Jobs was morally warped. ""Steve Jobs"" bolsters this contention by having Lisas mother Chrisann Brennan (Katherine Waterston) show up with Lisa in tow at the earliest launch like Maleficent at the baptism of Sleeping Beauty. Brennan rails at Jobs pointing out that she is on welfare while he is worth more than four hundred million dollars. The trouble is that she keeps showing up at the launches as Jobs is busy correcting the final kinks in his presentation. You can see why Sorkin and Boyle engineer this coincidence repeatedly soldering together the private and public manias of their central character and thus allowing the dramatic charge to flow. Stand back however and such hard rewiring of the facts doesnt look quite so clever and intense. It looks silly. Something similar happens at the board meeting in 1985 where Jobs is shorn of his executive powers. Board members side with the less mercurial John Sculley (Jeff Daniels) the C.E.O. of Apple. The movie itself though sides with Jobs less in the weighing of the arguments--Sorkin is happiest when the pit-a-pat of conversation quickens into the rat-a-tat of a battle royal--than in the styling of the clash. It happens during yet another flashback in the small hours with rain bathing the windows like floods of tears. The protagonists are filmed at freakish angles and the shadows of the window frames cast doomy diagonals. I hate to ask but is it not common practice at the board meetings of major organizations to turn on an overhead light? Did Jobs object to the insufficiently soft click of the switch or what? The echo here is of ""Citizen Kane"" where the camera cranes over a rooftop and down through a skylight in a weltering storm. If Boyle borrows from the most lauded film of all time its because his own movie addresses the most exhaustively lauded theme of our own time. Within the frantic mythology of business the ejection of Jobs has acquired the sheen of a fable; his mortification led not merely to a bounce back but to a resurrection and thence to the iWorld that we are blessed to inhabit today. The fabling began with Jobss commencement speech at Stanford in 2005 when he spoke about leaving Apple ""I had been rejected but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over."" Two other things should be noted about that speech. First according to Isaacson whom did Jobs nervous at the prospect of writing it contact for professional help? Aaron Sorkin. Nothing came of that request reportedly and Jobs composed the speech himself. Second he declared at the outset ""Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. Thats it. No big deal. Just three stories."" Pretty much like the movie we have now. Buttressed by Fassbender who is as meticulous as ever ""Steve Jobs"" delivers what has become a standard dichotomy Jobs could be a monster but he was also a genius. We dont see him--to pick just a couple of the childish sins anthologized by Isaacson--attending a Halloween party dressed as Jesus or regularly parking athwart two parking spaces for the disabled but dont worry there is plenty of crappy behavior to gawk at. Jobs chews out the hapless Wozniak (a better writer of code and an infinitely nicer human) in public from the stage of an auditorium just to ram home the execration. Yet not for a minute are we invited to doubt that Jobs was in the long run right and that he belongs in the company of those famed achievers--Einstein Gandhi and so on--who littered Apples ""Think Different"" campaign. The dichotomy turns out to be a false one whether you revile him or genuflect before him you are still implying that the guy demands and deserves our fascination. What Sorkin and Boyle have to offer is not a warts-and-all portrait but the suggestion that there is something heroic about a wart. As a result despite the lunging modernity of the products on display ""Steve Jobs"" comes across as strangely old-fashioned in this romantic insistence on its hero. It veers closer to ""Lust for Life"" Vincente Minnellis bio-pic of van Gogh than to ""The Social Network"" which was also scripted by Sorkin but which steered us through the ventures of Mark Zuckerberg--no less labyrinthine than those of Jobs--with clarity and calm. Not once in that film did we feel ourselves baffled or trapped whereas the corporate tangles in ""Steve Jobs"" grow dangerously dense. The best reason to see it is Kate Winslet she plays Joanna Hoffman who was a wizard of Apple marketing and one of the few hardy souls who could stand up to Jobs. Bit by bit armed with large spectacles a punchy accent and dark unlovely hair she becomes the movies anchor quelling its tonal excesses much as Hoffman reined in the savage temper of Jobs. Yet even she with her wisdom and her poise is cast in the role of disciple; having chided Jobs for his treatment of Lisa and Chrisann she still fusses over him before he goes onstage pats him tenderly and says ""Now go put a dent in the universe."" Yeah yeah. Try telling that to Einstein. The most cheering surprise of the season is ""Pan."" No more juice one might suppose could be squeezed from the fruits of J. M. Barries inspiration. Surely we must be Panned out. Yet here is Joe Wrights new film which reaches back to a story behind the story and finds Peter (Levi Miller) an orphan boy plucked from his bed in a sort of anti-Rapture and hauled up into an airborne pirate ship. The setting is not the Edwardian London of the Darling family but the London of the Second World War and the ship is instantly caught in a dogfight with British Spitfires firing its cannons through the clouds. By any decent logic such brazen mashing of genres and time periods should not work. But it does. The captain of the vessel is Blackbeard (Hugh Jackman). He is pilfering kids and spiriting them to Neverland where they toil in mines chipping away for pixum--a glowing fairy treasure which Blackbeard smokes through a creepy mask in a bid for rejuvenation. Pirate crack Peter flies and flees aided by a brawny American named James Hook (Garrett Hedlund) who has two complete arms and buckets of pep. Together they make for the tribal village swoon over Tiger Lily (Rooney Mara) and plot the thorough trouncing of the villain. ""Not large and sprawly you know with tedious distances between one adventure and another but nicely crammed"" such was Barries own account of Neverland and ""Pan""--Wrights best film so far livelier and more disloyal to its source than ""Atonement"" or ""Pride and Prejudice""--crams without a care. The outcome is that increasing rarity a proper childrens film; even the tears are well earned. The climax takes place inside a mountain of pixum yet the true highlight is Jackman a splendiferous blend of the wheedling the mournful the murderous and the throwaway. ""Childhood isnt so jolly"" he says. ""In fact its rather frightening."" All the more so if you never grow up.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Michael Fassbender (left) portrays Jobs; hes shown here with Seth Rogen as Steve Wozniak. Francois Duhamel/Courtesy of Universal Pictures You may feel youve been here before the story of a man who uses technology to bring millions of people together but who cant seem to figure out how to connect with the people who are actually around him. Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin told that story a few years back in his script for the Facebook movie The Social Network. Now in Steve Jobs hes got a strikingly different equally riveting take centered on the guy who put music in your pocket and gave the world a personal computer that said ""Hello"" -- ideas that sounded crazy back when most of what computers did was make spreadsheets. The film begins with a 1974 video clip not of the title character but of sci-fi author Arthur C. Clarke speaking in a room dominated by an enormous industrial computer about a then almost inconceivable future when average Joes would have computers in their own homes. He has to convince a skeptical interviewer that this might possibly be a good thing. That year a 19-year-old Jobs wouldve been planning a trip to India to study Buddhism but in the next shot we meet him a decade later as hes about to unveil the Macintosh personal computer to an audience whose appetite has been whetted by an Orwellian Ridley Scott commercial titled simply ""1984."" The commercial which aired during the Super Bowl didnt show the product because the product wasnt ready yet. And as Jobs played with ferocious intensity by Michael Fassbender stands backstage preparing to introduce it it still isnt. For some reason it wont say ""Hello."" So hes badgering insisting cajoling threatening -- doing whatever it takes to get his tech team led by a panicked Andy Hertzfeld (Michael Stuhlbarg) to promise the Mac will talk on cue. How he earns the loyalty of people who look to him for approval and never ever get it is at once the crux of the film and its great mystery. Theres Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak played explosively by Seth Rogen who notes that Jobs cant write code isnt an engineer or a designer and is still being described in the press as a ""genius."" ""What do you do?"" he asks in exasperation. And Woz is hardly the only person Jobs ticks off. Theres the mother (Katherine Waterston) of a daughter (Makenzie Moss then Perla Haney-Jardine) he refuses to acknowledge; the marketer/right-hand/conscience who enables him (Kate Winslet); the multitude of hangers-on who have to make things actually work ... hard feelings every step of the way Sorkin and director Danny Boyle give the story a three-act structure -- each act playing out in real time -- all of it crisis time in the half-hour or so just before three of those product launches Jobs was so famously good at. First the original Mac. Then the attention-getting but wildly overpriced NeXT CUBE in 1988 after Jobs had been fired from Apple by John Sculley (Jeff Daniels) the former Pepsi exec hed helped install as CEO. And finally in 1998 after Apple had hired him back he premieres the egg-shape iMac that would set the company on its industry-dominating path. The films tension comes partly from a raft of terrific performances -- everyones good and Fassbenders stellar -- and partly from juxtaposing Jobs public and private personas. He could make cheering audiences believe he was changing the world but backstage ... not so much. If you have a sharp eye youll note a difference in texture as the film moves through these three launches. Boyle shoots the first section in 16 millimeter the second in considerably less grainy 35 millimeter the third in glossy crystalline high-def -- a visual echo for the technical advances Jobs is talking so passionately about. And talking and talking in Sorkins hard-charging superarticulate somehow still emotionally resonant way. The film feels so electric while youre watching its hard to believe that after two hours it doesnt even get to the iPod let alone the iPhone. Maybe theyre leaving themselves room for Steve Jobs 2? Or rather Steve Jobs ... what would the Apple folks call it? Yosemite and El Capitan are their operating systems. Maybe Steve Jobs Half Dome. Theyll announce it but it wont be available for a year. And itll cost an extra 100. And the ticketll require a new adapter. And well all -- millions of us -- line up happily to buy it.

The film is directed by Danny Boyle of Slumdog Millionaire. By Peter Rainer Film critic October 9 2015 Save for later Saved Steve Jobs (Michael Fassbender) is the guru with a people problem in Aaron Sorkins Steve Jobs. Universal Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of In ""Steve Jobs"" Michael Fassbender in the title role is a blending of victor and villain savior and slime. Hes irresistibly repellent but because his technovision radicalized our relationship with computers the world sees him as a guru - perhaps the guru - for our age.It would take a great novelist a Dreiser or a Balzac to truly comprehend a character of such scope. Instead what we have in ""Steve Jobs"" written by Aaron Sorkin (""The Social Network"") and directed by Danny Boyle (""Slumdog Millionaire"") is less a full-scale comprehension than a three-dimensional dartboard not dissimilar in some ways to Alex Gibneys recent documentary takedown ""Steve Jobs The Man in the Machine."" For most of its two hours its brainy high-speed entertainment but the filmmakers are not quite as smart as they think they are. For all its flash and hypertalk ""Steve Jobs"" is an old-school movie in new-style camouflage.With Jobsian precision Sorkin has structured the film into three acts of about 40 minutes each. The sections all feature a recurring cast of characters - aides workers family - functioning as a kind of Greek (or is it Geek?) chorus. They counterbalance Jobss messianic posturings. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time The first act set in 1984 takes place backstage at an auditorium of a northern California community college as Jobs is about to unveil the Mac computer. The second act jumps ahead backstage to the San Francisco Opera House in 1988 as Jobs recently fired from Apple is poised to introduce his ill-fated NeXT computer. The third backstage act 10 years later has Jobs now 43 in full triumphalist mode as he prepares to unleash the iMac. The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide The first act sets the template for the others. Jobs is incensed that technical glitches are holding up the show. He wants the Mac to say ""Hello"" to the audience and threatens his software designer Michael Stuhlbargs Andy Hertzfeld with public humiliation if he doesnt fix it pronto. He is also incensed that Time magazine did not make him its Man of the Year because of he believes revelations about his mistreatment of his ex-girlfriend Chrisann (Katherine Waterston) and the daughter Lisa whose paternity he refuses to acknowledge even after a definitive court-ordered blood test. (While Jobs was worth more than 400 million the two were on welfare.)Other figures recur throughout the three acts. Jobss Apple cofounder Steve (""Woz"") Wozniak played by Seth Rogen wants from Jobs public recognition for the integral role he and others played in the development of the original companys only true commercial success the Apple II. Apple chief executive officer John Sculley (Jeff Daniels) who has the dubious distinction of being the man who fired Jobs from Apple nevertheless stands somewhat in awe of him. Jobs has disdain for Sculleys corporatist conservatism. He sneers to him that ""artists lead and hacks ask for a show of hands.""The only person who pierces Jobss armor even slightly is his ever-present marketing executive Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet) who when not salving his ego cautions him to make amends with his daughter (played by Perla Haney-Jardine as a 19-year-old in the third acts father-daughter reckoning).Just as he did in ""The Social Network"" Sorkin uses ""Citizen Kane"" as his inspiration here. (Theres even a Rosebud-style revelation at the end.) These films are all about American archetypes brought low - visionary tycoons whose fatal flaw is their lack of human connection. Bill Gates better worry Sorkin isnt out to trash him next.As scathingly played by Fassbender Jobs looks almost as sleek and perfected as one of his computers. This is why in the end when Jobs tells his daughter ""Im poorly made"" its both a confession and a sick joke. The bot recognizes his botness.What the filmmakers are missing is that by castigating Jobs they ignore the fact that for better or worse the millions of people who idolize him for his products dont really care about all that bad stuff. Steve Jobs is not Uncle Walt. In our winner-take-all culture mega-success has created its own protective shield. Gurus get a free pass.Sorkin goes heavy on the pop psych sentimentality Jobs cant get close to people because he was adopted and thus felt rejected; he has to control everything because his entry into the world was out of his control; his computer designs are flawless because his life conspicuously is not; and so on. The people who line up against him - Woz Andy his daughter and all the rest - are without blemish or ulterior motive. Their accusations are righteous. They keep coming back to him not because of his star power or because he can do something for them but because they serve as his collective unbidden conscience. ""Why do you want people to dislike you"" Hertzfeld asks. ""You can be decent and gifted at the same time"" Woz says.If the filmmakers had demonstrated real daring they would have made the accusers less ennobling and Jobs in all his vaunted egomania would not be someone apart from us. He would be us. Grade B+ (Rated R for language.)

"Hard to Be a God Steve Jobs Thinks Different About Steve Jobs << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Hard to Be a God Steve Jobs Thinks Different About Steve Jobs Universal Pictures Movies October 9 2015 by Alex Pappademas Facebook Twitter Print Steve Jobs is dead to begin with -- there is no doubt whatsoever about that. Maybe this was what emboldened screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and director Danny Boyle to take the liberties they do in Steve Jobs and maybe it wasnt. It did mean that Sorkin got access to Lisa Brennan-Jobs -- the daughter whom Jobs initially refused to acknowledge was his and one of the few key figures who declined to be interviewed for the thick-as-a-brick Walter Isaacson biography that Sorkins script burns for fuel. Brennan-Jobs was reluctant to talk to Isaacson when her father was still alive but she talked to Sorkin extensively.1 We cant really know exactly how her perspective shaped the movie. But Sorkin -- also the father of a daughter for what its worth -- was either taken enough with her story or grateful enough for her input that hes conceived Steve Jobs as a film about a smart little girl and the big mean blustery mess of a father who finally opens his arms to her in his way and in spite of himself. Its not the only relationship the film explores but its the hook on which everything else hangs including the somewhat hollow third-act redemption it contrives for its subject who dreamed that a computer could be a thing of beauty and was willing to just about decapitate anyone who disagreed. At one point in the film Jobs reminds another character that he believes in giving consumers two options -- buy it or dont. The movie takes its cues from him. In Steve Jobs Sorkin takes interactions and confrontations that occurred at different points in Jobss life or not at all and reimagines them as having taken place backstage in the minutes immediately before Jobs unveiled one of three new products -- Apples Macintosh in 1984 the NeXT Computer in 1988 and the original Bondi blue iMac G3 in 1998. (Each sequence gets its own distinct look grainy/nostalgic 16-millimeter for the Mac sumptuous 35 for the NeXT warts-and-all digital for the iMac.) The films more-than-a-little-bit cockamamy sub-premise is that on each of these crucially important days Jobs also found himself scheduled for back-to-back come-to-Jesus meetings with people hed wronged on his way to the top including Lisa and her mother Chrisann Brennan (Katherine Waterston); Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen putting deepening wrinkles of hurt in his Fozzie Bear rumble); and the companys third CEO John Sculley (Jeff Daniels perfectly wry and wounded). Sculley shows up as a slayable father figure/level boss in all three chapters even though in real life he and Jobs rarely spoke after spring 1985 when Jobs fought Sculley for control of Apples board and lost. And while Mac marketing guru Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet) did follow Jobs from Apple to NeXT and was famously one of the few people who could stand up to him and live to tell the tale shed moved on to a position at General Magic and then to retirement by the time the iMac hit. Im also going to assume Hoffman was more than the sassy-but-supportive Sorkin work-wife figure this movie makes her out to be. Of course Sorkin has freely admitted that if any of these scenes actually happened the way hes written them itd be news to him -- but when you see the movie chances are youll understand exactly why he played so fast and loose with history. By tossing out the biopic beat sheet and zeroing in on the parts of Jobss business that most resembled show business Sorkin has moved Jobss story into his own comfort zone. Its now a three-act backstage-panic comedy/melodrama about a brilliant work-fixated white guy whose genius far exceeds his emotional intelligence and the people who cant help but love him anyway. Occasionally flashbacks peek into other chapters -- Jobs and Wozniak in the Los Altos garage arguing over whether a computer should be like a painting and the Cupertino boardroom showdown between Sculley and Jobs that preceded Jobss departure from the company in 1985. But huge pieces of Jobss life and career fall outside the frame Windows Laurene Powell Buddhism the iPhone Feist cancer the Foxconn suicide nets and the part of the Isaacson book where Mac software architect Andy Hertzfeld tries to cheer up the ousted Jobs by bringing him a copy of Bob Dylans Empire Burlesque and Jobs dismisses ""When the Night Comes Falling From the Sky"" as ""too disco"" proving once and for all that whatever his other sins Steve was also guilty of underrating Sly and Robbie. We dont get a cinematic rendering of the telling black-comic moment in the Isaacson book when Jobs fighting pneumonia in a liver-transplant ward in Memphis Tennessee stirs from the depths of sedation to rip an oxygen mask off his face and tell the pulmonologist he wont wear it because its badly designed -- a moment made for the parallel world where the Coen brothers got to this story first. Nor does Sorkins Jobs ever come near the self-awareness the actual Jobs displayed in admitting to Isaacson toward the end of his life that he never liked putting on/off switches on Apple products because he wants to believe our consciousness survives after we die. Jobss fear that death might indeed be the end has given us a world of ever-present devices that are sometimes sleeping but always on; in a sense its also given us a world where we too are sometimes sleeping but always on. Its been suggested that by hooking us on closed-system technologies designed to steer us toward specifically and idiosyncratically Jobsian approaches to work and creation and human interaction Jobs took his wound and inflicted it on all of us. This is the most provocative idea in Alex Gibneys recent damning documentary Steve Jobs The Man in the Machine even if Gibney bound by the constraints of nonfiction cant quite say it out loud. It also floats through the background of Sorkins screenplay although technology itself is as tangential to this story as the fortunes of the mighty Bengals of Cincinnati were to the lives of the people on Sports Night. Its pretty clear Sorkin views each of the products that Jobs unveils as a newer neater bottle for the same old snake oil. The most symbolically significant computer in the film is the NeXT system from 88 a beautifully designed black cube that doesnt actually have an operating system yet because Jobs is waiting to build one he can barter to Apple as a get-out-of-exile-free card. So someone asks its just a black cube? ""Yeah"" Jobs says. ""But isnt it the coolest black cube youve ever seen?"" As in The Social Network Sorkins disdain for the inherent arrogance of technological futurism as a character trait keeps him from thinking clearly or critically about the actual futures his characters think theyre inventing; thats the bad news. The good news is that if you can ignore what its not doing Steve Jobs creates a reality-distortion field as powerful and persuasive as the one its subject was famous for projecting. Sorkins dialogue is a helluva drug and Boyle finds clever ways to bring life to an all-talk script without getting all Birdman about it. Whether you thought Jobs was the messiah of tech-gnosis or a sneering Bond villain in dad jeans the movies carbonated crispness will still carry you out of the theater on an iCloud.  Thanks in part to the Sony hackers we know that this movie and its cast took a while to come together. We know that it was almost a David Fincher film with Christian Bale as Jobs and that Leonardo DiCaprio and (fascinatingly) Tom Cruise were both considered for the lead after Bale dropped out and that when Michael Fassbender was floated as an alternative Sorkin responded with Jobsian tact by asking who the fuck this ""Michael Fassbender"" person was. All of this now seems like a long journey to a retrospectively obvious destination. Fassbender looks enough like Jobs that its not distracting and he finds a voice for the character -- thin somewhat unpleasant with a rueful hitch thatll remind Sorkheads of Bradley Whitfords Josh Lyman and a pipsqueak lilt that bugged me until I realized I was hearing Alex P. Keaton in it -- that dissolves whatever issues of verisimilitude remain. His Jobs always sounds like hes just finished a temper tantrum except when hes winding up to throw another one. Fassbender actually does less with his body than Ashton Kutcher did in Joshua Michael Sterns studiously misbegotten Jobs from 2013 but Id trade all of Kutchers carefully observed gangling for the split-second moment here when Lisa throws her arms around Steve and whispers ""I want to live with you"" and Fassbenders Jobs reacts as a traffic light might. And I mean of course the perfect actor for the Jobs part turned out to be the guy who plays Magneto -- the haughtiest and most regally bored mutant in Marvels menagerie a super-antihero whose key traits include childhood trauma a homicidal impatience with humanitys sluggish evolution and a will that can literally bend steel. Hes at his most obviously supervillainous in the first act robotically responding ""Apple donates millions of dollars worth of computers to underfunded schools"" when Waterston pleads with him to pay her more than 385 a month in child support now that hes worth 441 million -- and insisting in front of his daughter that the name of Apples ""LISA"" computer was merely an acronym for ""Local Integrated System Architecture."" Meanwhile Hertzfeld (Michael Stuhlbarg lovely and understated as the avatar of every other poor bastard charged with telling Jobs ""no"") and his team (a group of perfectly cast alternate-timeline Morks) struggle to debug the Mac prototypes text-to-speech software after Jobs admonishes them ""Fuck you -- we need it to say Hello."" In real life the computer didnt just talk -- it told jokes about IBM then introduced Jobs as ""a man whos been like a father to me"" a moment Sorkin weirdly leaves out.

Jobs shrugs off worldly concerns with gnomic pronouncements like ""The very nature of people is something to be overcome"" and ""God sent his only son on a suicide mission but we like him anyway because he made trees."" Cut to a wave sweeping through the auditorium -- the cult of Steve already a fait accompli. Not for the last time Boyle emphasizes the disconnect between the public and private Jobs by shooting Fassbender in a makeup mirror framed so that his image seems to linger there for a split second after hes gotten up and moved. By the time we get to 1988 the mirror-Jobs has taken over booking Symphony Hall in San Francisco for an elegantly micromanaged luncheon in honor of a Trojan-horse computer that Sun Microsystems chief scientist Bill Joy would later call ""the first yuppie workstation."" Its the most classically cinematic part of the movie -- in his ostentatiously post-nerdy power suit Fassbender looks like Michael Corleone and acts like Fredo pretending to be Sonny shooing away the daughter he still cant bring himself to parent and then hypocritically bellowing ""Thats what men do"" at Sculley moments later. The scene cuts back and forth between their Symphony Hall standoff and the meeting that led to Jobs quitting Apple in 1985; its Sorkin cross-fading two streams of Sorkin-talk as in the dueling-depositions sequence from The Social Network only here its harder to follow which Jobs is yelling what at which Sculley. A genericized electronic version of ""Where the Streets Have No Name"" by future iTunes shills U2 greets Jobss arrival onstage then carries us off to the late 90s where Wozniak and Hertzfeld pop up again like aggrieved ghosts of Christmases past. Then Jobs and 19-year-old Lisa (Perla Haney-Jardine) have it out in front of massive black-and-white portraits of the pantheonic culture heroes who starred in Apples ""Think different"" campaign. A key shot encourages us to think of Lisa as Bob Dylan (to Jobss Mr. Jones I guess) and she gets what feels like the last word ""Think is a verb making differently an adverb."" It should be a mic drop but of course it isnt. Theres still time for Jobs to chase her down and tell her what we want to hear -- that hes his own shittiest product an emotional Newton a very good wizard and a very not-great man. Oh and -- 2000s spoiler alert -- he promises to make her something to replace that ugly cassette Walkman shes still carrying around. The Isaacson book suggests that the relationship Jobs and Lisa struck up as she got older was fragile and that theyd grown apart again before Jobs got sick; the movie grants him absolution by leaving off where it does. Except its more than absolution -- in the last scene brimming with strobe-lit rapture playing out on the principal actors faces and a stormingly emotive Maccabees song I assume is titled ""They Called Us After Coldplay Said No"" its strongly implied that in finally accepting dadhood Jobs also attained godhood. Hes rendered remote and holographic a benevolent presence you can see but not touch. I thought of the end of Wild Palms when Robert Loggia catches a computer virus while attempting to upload himself to the Cloud and boils away into loose pixels while singing ""Hello I Must Be Going"" and of the parts of Cats when the felines sing one of their kind up to the Heaviside layer but your user experience may vary. Obviously ending a Steve Jobs movie is no easy task; if I recall correctly the Kutcher version basically leapfrogs over years of untidy history to Think different then leaves off so abruptly that it might as well have cut to a hastily scrawled title card reading ""NOTE STEVE JOBS DIED ON THE WAY BACK TO HIS HOME PLANET."" Sorkin and Boyles movie ends more gracefully but its uplift comes more or less out of nowhere and unless youve been holding out for permission to keep thinking of Jobs as a hero it might leave you feeling cheated. I like the rest of Steve Jobs enough to want to pretend they did it that way on purpose. Full weird disclosure Brennan-Jobs and I attended the same goofball Northern California elementary school in the late 80s although we were a grade apart and I dont recall us ever having a conversation. This would apparently not disqualify me from being the basis for a major supporting character in a future Aaron Sorkin film about Brennan-Jobs.

"Aaron Sorkins Steve Jobs starring Michael Fassbender reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Inside Steve Jobs Reality Distortion Field With Aaron Sorkin Inside Steve Jobs Reality Distortion Field With Aaron Sorkin Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Oct. 9 2015 1029 AM The Shark Michael Fassbender as a predatory Steve Jobs in Danny Boyle and Aaron Sorkins biopic. By Dana Stevens Michael Fassbender in Steve Jobs. Photo courtesy Universal Pictures When I told a colleague I was on my way to see Steve Jobs Danny Boyles biopic about the Apple founder and personal-computing guru he asked ""Havent we figured out who Steve Jobs is yet?"" In the four years since his death three feature-length films have devoted themselves to understanding debunking and/or lionizing this paradigm-changing figure. But Im not sure any of them has yet satisfactorily addressed that complex question. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Joshua Michael Sterns Jobs (2013) was so worshipful in tone that one former Apple higher-up derided it as ""fan fiction."" Alex Gibneys recent documentary Steve Jobs The Man in the Machine while not hagiographic takes pains to insist on the ultimate unknowability of its subject. Neither example has stopped screenwriter Aaron Sorkin from taking a crack of his own at creating a credible dramatic character from the man in the black mock turtleneck. Advertisement Here that famous garment has the luck to enclose the slender well-muscled torso of Michael Fassbender. Fassbender looks more than a bit like the charismatic tech titan (after several spins through the sexifying machine but thats Hollywood for you). But where Ashton Kutcher in Jobs played Jobs as a sort of digital-age holy fool socially maladroit but able to see futures invisible to those around him Fassbenders Jobs is scarily attuned to his surroundings at all times. Displaying the same kind of intensity he brought to the role of a malevolent android in Prometheus Fassbender reads the mood of every room hes in with the hunger of a shark circling for prey. In fact the computer image of a Great White figures significantly in one scene as Jobs berates an underling for failing to provide the perfect shark photo for a big product-launch presentation. Product launches--three of them in 1984 1988 and 1998--provide the Aristotelian unities in Sorkins tidy three-act play of a script. Each act takes place in the final tense minutes before the public unveiling of a new would-be breakthrough first the earliest mass-marketed Macintosh personal computer; then the unsuccessful ""black cube"" Jobs produced for his own company NeXT during the years of his exile from Apple; and finally the compact desktop iMac that helped turn the personal computer from a hobbyists plaything into an indispensable household appliance. At each launch just as the house is about to open to the public Jobs personal life collides with his professional one with some unexpected figure from the past (sometimes several at once) showing up to demand retribution. At each launch he walks-and-talks down endless hallways bantering Sorkinishly with his exasperated right-hand woman Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet who in her 1984 guise makes a good argument for the return of the Dorothy Hamill wedge cut). And at every launch technical glitches and perfectionist self-sabotage threaten to wreck the impending demonstration upon whose success or failure--at least for those within range of what Jobs colleagues used to describe as his ""reality distortion field""--the very future of the planet hangs. Sorkins script is loosely based on Walter Isaacsons authorized biography though the word ""authorized"" suggests a pious approach thats the opposite of this films often unflattering treatment of its subject. Isaacsons book includes extensive interviews with Jobs himself but theres also ample testimony not only from his most loyal associates but from the many people he undervalued and alienated both at Apple and in his personal life. The Jobs of the book unlike the Jobs of the adaptation expresses sincere regret for his mistreatment of his first girlfriend Chrisann Brennan (superbly played here by Inherent Vices Katherine Waterston). When she got pregnant and was summarily dumped by the work-obsessed Jobs Chrisann had to take her increasingly wealthy ex to court to prove paternity--and then after a DNA test determined a 94-plus percent probability of Jobs being the childs father she had to endure Jobs insinuation in the press that--to put it only slightly more crassly than he did at the time--he was being swindled by a crazy gold-digging slut. Steve Jobs vision of Chrisann isnt entirely angelic--she comes off as a financial flake and an incompetent if loving mother. But the movie posits from its opening scene onward that Jobs refusal to acknowledge or help raise his child in the early years of her life was more than a youthful oversight It was the central mistake of his life a deliberately hostile act sustained over a long period that caused lasting harm to everyone involved. That included some of Jobs longtime associates who were torn between their desire to help out his family and their fear of their emotionally volatile chief. The great character actor Michael Stuhlbarg (A Serious Man) plays out this conflict in the person of Andy Herzfeld a key member of the original Apple team who incurs his ex-bosss wrath when he loans money to Jobs now college-age daughter. Advertisement Seth Rogen plays Steve Wozniak Jobs earliest partner in the development of the personal computer and another of the people in his life that he consistently and grievously mistreated. Rogens Woz isnt given quite the screen time or the back story that Josh Gads got in the 2013 biopic but we all know the woes of Woz How he was cheated first financially and then emotionally by the man who took his nuts-and-bolts technical know-how and without ever fully acknowledging the debt parlayed it into a massively successful company that sometimes seemed to be selling the tech equivalent of snake oil--until suddenly Apple created something we didnt realize wed always needed and then something else and then something else. Steve Jobs borrows a bit too often on the audiences prior knowledge of the oft-visited stations of the Apple cross. Jobs early days building motherboards with Woz in the garage--glimpsed in a few micro-flashbacks--are assumed to make up part of our available stock of Jobs lore as are the circumstances surrounding the adopted Jobs reunion with his long-lost biological sister the novelist Mona Simpson. But that light touch fits a playfully minimalist drama that far from trying to touch on every major event of its subjects life purposely withholds or elides the key moments--always fading to black for example just as the launch presentation is about to begin. Its all too neatly staged to make for dynamic cinema even if the dialogue does crackle with a delicious nastiness. (Jobs ""Im indifferent to whether or not people like me."" Herzfeld ""In that case I can tell you I never have."") But when Boyle attempts to jazz up the talky indoor proceedings using radically canted camera angles and gimmicky effects (as two characters discuss the Skylab project an image of the shuttle launch magically projects itself on the wall behind them) the effect is only to increase the sense of static claustrophobia. Steve Jobs was initially meant to be directed by David Fincher who left the project last year over battles with Sony about creative control and compensation that recall some of Jobs corporate power struggles at Apple. Its interesting to imagine what Fincher with his eagle eye for vanity and other human follies might have made of Sorkins genially misanthropic script. As it is Steve Jobs feels like a sharply written flamboyantly over-directed meticulously acted probably inaccurate and necessarily incomplete portrait of the enigmatic black-clad man whose vision of the future helped create the 21st century as we know it. Can we let a little more of that century go by before someone undertakes another attempt to explain him?

VPCMichael Fassbender takes on a tech giant in the drama Steve Jobs.(Photo Universal Pictures)The wait for the definitive onscreen Steve Jobs has been as arduous as the anticipation for the next iPhone.No need to reboot again because Hollywood has finally found its man. Michael Fassbender embodies the iconic Apple co-founder in more ways than just wearing his trademark black turtleneck jeans and New Balance sneakers in the striking and innovative Steve Jobs (1/2 out of four; rated R; opens Friday in New York and Los Angeles nationwide Oct. 23).USA TODAYAs Steve Jobs Michael Fassbender may be Oscar-boundDirected by Danny Boyle and featuring a cracking good script by Aaron Sorkin the drama aggressively eschews normal biopic methodology for a curious three-act structure that works for the most part The movie focuses on Jobs in the moments before three huge launches while also tracking the tech giants rise and fall and rise again. Its fitting since much of the film explores whether the Jobs that people saw was just another product of a genius mind.""Everyone is waiting for the Mac"" Jobs proudly states in 1984 to his marketing chief Joanna Hoffman (a remarkable Kate Winslet). His unending passion to change not just computers but human lives with personal technology is clear even then though the minutiae bother him too. Jobs about has a fit when a demo doesnt seem to work at first -- he gets it right later of course because hes Steve Jobs -- while fellow co-founder Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen) sulks about something more significant to him the benching of the Apple II in favor of Jobs dream machine.USA TODAY5 things we learned about Steve Jobs at NYFFThe drama isnt just in the computer arena and taking on Microsoft. Jobs himself adopted is confronted with his estranged young daughter (Makenzie Moss) initially denying paternity but taking responsibility by the time 1988 -- the setting for the second act -- rolls around. Hes on stage for a next-generation computer from NeXT the company Jobs formed after being booted from Apple but there are still hard feelings with Apple CEO John Sculley (Jeff Daniels) leading to an intensely watchable war of words.Jobs is back in the fold by 1998 and ready to unveil the colorful iMac which leads to many confrontations and a satisfying albeit sudden finale.Rogen is steady as Wozniak and makes the most of his dramatic telling off of Jobs ""Its not binary. You can be decent and gifted at the same time."" And Michael Stuhlbarg brings warmth and talent to the supporting role of Andy Hertzfeld a friend of Jobs who stepped up for him when he couldnt be bothered.USA TODAYMichael Fassbender studied Ashton Kutcher to play Steve JobsSorkins script is clever and knowing -- at one point late in the proceedings Jobs wonders aloud why ""everybody gets drunk"" and takes him to task five minutes before every event. Its a small moment that breaks the fourth wall in the slightest and smartest of ways.Fassbender gives his lines measured weight and gravitas in his interpretation of the late enigmatic legend that also exorcises the demons of poor Jobses past (apologies Noah Wyle and Ashton Kutcher). Hes at times a cruel jerk and moments later a loving soul Jobs is protective of Wozniak while in the same sentence calling him ""Rain Man."" The actor nails all the techno mumbo jumbo is a force in the scenes where Jobs takes charge but is probably best when this pop-culture antihero has to be tender around the kid he struggles to know.Steve Jobs is a fascinating study of a man explaining who he was but never making a judgment about who he is. The movie lets audiences compute that for themselves. 57 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 5 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1RwJwZC",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/10/08/review-steve-jobs-movie/73534044/,200,stevejobs26,stevejobs,usatoday

Photo Credit AP / Francois Duhamel advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The behind-the-scenes story of the co-founder of Apple Inc. Rated R (language). BOTTOM LINE A whirlwind tour through the computer age with a flawed human at its center. CAST Michael Fassbender Kate Winslet Jeff Daniels LENGTH 202 ""Well know soon enough whether youre Leonardo da Vinci or just think you are"" Steve Wozniak says in ""Steve Jobs"" Danny Boyles compelling study of genius and gracelessness. Wozniak a co-founder of Apple Inc. played by an earnest Seth Rogen is speaking to his rather more famous colleague and his choice of analogy is apt. Jobs was also a Renaissance man -- inventor entrepreneur designer. Somehow though we think of him as an artist. Starring a finely calibrated Michael Fassbender in the title role ""Steve Jobs"" asks whether Jobs brilliance excuses his personal failings a question we wouldnt normally ask about a CEO. Because Jobs products have been so life-changing -- and so mesmerizingly cool-looking -- hes risen to a whole different status. ""Steve Jobs"" written by Aaron Sorkin (""The Social Network"") from Walter Isaacsons authorized biography is neither hagiography nor hatchet job but a look at the deeply flawed human who led us into the computer age. advertisement | advertise on newsday ""Steve Jobs"" is broken into three acts centered on momentous product launches in San Francisco 1984s Macintosh (driven by Ridley Scotts groundbreaking ""1984"" television spot) 1988s cube-shaped NeXT Computer (a flop) and 1998s iMac the forerunner of todays Apple desktops. Boyle visually establishes each time and place -- grainy 16 mm film for the first act crisp digital for the third -- while the actors provide the drama. Most of that comes from Jobs daughter Lisa Brennan played by three actresses but most movingly by Ripley Sobo as a precocious 9-year-old. Jobs attitude toward her begins as denial (in a remarkably nasty scene with her mother played by Katherine Waterston) but ends as something very different. Other characters recur -- Kate Winslet is the outspoken Apple marketing chief Joanna Hoffman while an excellent Jeff Daniels brings new shadings to Apples vilified former CEO John Sculley -- but Lisa is the moral and emotional crux of ""Steve Jobs."" Without her this would be merely a fast fun wonky whirlwind through Apple history. Any Aaron Sorkin movie no matter who the director invariably becomes an Aaron Sorkin movie and ""Steve Jobs"" is the Sorkiniest yet. His dense information-rich dialogue can be thrilling and poetic but also preachy and pat. Still ""Steve Jobs"" does exactly what it set out to do allowing us to regard an almost godlike figure -- immortal still thanks to iPods and iPhones -- with a mix of awe and sympathy.

Entertainment ""Steve Jobs"" Turns Apples Founder Into A Fascinating Jerk Michael Fassbender and Aaron Sorkin dazzle with this flashy movie about being a visionary and being an asshole. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Michael Fassbender as Steve Jobs. Universal Pictures ID 7052146 Aaron Sorkin has described himself as ""just this side of luddite."" Hes made it clear that he cant stand the internet which he feels is full of people who talk and talk and dont listen to each other not unlike those in an Aaron Sorkin screenplay.Youd think that being indifferent-to-hostile toward technology would make someone a pretty crummy candidate to write movies about two of the tech worlds most influential figures. But instead The Social Network and Steve Jobs bring out The West Wing creators best and most affectingly ambivalent self one interested in challenging the self-mythologizing to which the industry is prone rather than bolstering it up.Sorkins long-held faith in the abilities of great men to lead humanity forward is transmuted by his lack of affinity for technology into something with more perspective and plangency. Rather than just celebrate their subjectss achievements these movies use them to springboard into pointed explorations of modern masculinity. View this image > Katherine Waterston as Chrisann Brennan and Makenzie Moss as 5-year-old Lisa Jobs. Francois Duhamel / Universal Pictures ID 7052209 These are stories about brilliant jerks.So The Social Network made Mark Zuckerberg and the creation of Facebook into a story about a guy who after being dumped tries not to win the girl back or become a nicer person but to make himself into someone whos too big a deal to ever be hurt again.And Steve Jobs portrays its title character as a guy so determined to think only of the big picture that when his ex (Katherine Waterston) asks if hes OK with how little money hes paying her in child support he responds by noting that Apple does donate computers to schools in underprivileged areas. Anyone who complained about factual fudging in The Social Network will find Steve Jobs even more of an irritant in how it funnels details of the Apple co-founders life through the run-up to three project launches with Jobs friends and frenemies and family and collaborators traipsing improbably by backstage.Those people can go watch Ashton Kutcher in Jobs or Noah Wyle in Pirates of Silicon Valley or Alex Gibneys recent warts-and-all doc Steve Jobs The Man in the Machine all of which run through Jobs milestones in a more traditional if not always sunnier fashion. But none of those are nearly as good a movie as Steve Jobs which stars Michael Fassbender as the title character and which is directed sturdily by Danny Boyle from a screenplay by Sorkin that sets out to dazzle with the keenness of its dialogue.Its a movie that feels theatrical in its constrained locales and its effervescent talkiness. Its first part takes place in 1984 right before the launch of the Macintosh. Its second is in 1988 as Jobs is about to unveil the NeXT computer. And its third is in 1998 at the introduction of the iMac. The film wanders from the stage to the green room to the parking garage on the roof but leaves the buildings only in flashbacks. Its like Birdman except its main character is able to unfurl his fervor and let them settle over his following like a fresh sheet. View this image > Fassbender as Jobs. Francois Duhamel / Universal Pictures ID 7052845 Isnt that what being a visionary means -- to be able to sell people on your ideas before theyre ever made solid? Theres always a screaming crowd waiting in Steve Jobs long before its main character ever has a home run. The Macintosh underperforms in its earliest incarnation and the NeXT isnt a hit either but fans do the wave and stomp their feet like theyre awaiting a rock star each time. Jobs during one of his three encounters with Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen) counters his collaborator and then former collaborators claim that Jobs has never been good at any of the actual stuff of building a computer by saying that hes the conductor not a musician.Its condescending as fuck telling the co-founder of your company that hes the equivalent of a first violin in your orchestra but it speaks to the unapologetic grandeur of Jobs ambition -- why would he be concerned with expansion cards when he cares about user experience? Why would he want to make his computers easier to customize for hobbyists when he believes he knows the best way to make them welcoming for the masses? He wants nothing less than to insert his devices into everyday life -- and obviously he succeeds though for decades before that point Apple maintained only a toehold on the market. View this image > Michael Stuhlbarg as Andy Hertzfeld Kate Winslet as Joanna Hoffman Fassbender as Jobs. Universal Pictures ID 7053292 Steve Jobs posits that the qualities that make its subject a genius on a large scale are ones that make him so difficult and exacting in his personal and professional relationships but it also suggests that Jobs cultivates this idea and uses it to shield himself. He tells employee and then former employee Andy Hertzfeld (a schlubbed-up Michael Stuhlbarg) that he doesnt care if people like him but its not true on multiple levels. He is furious about not being on the cover of Time. The three events he prepares for are about offering himself up to the audience to be worshipped especially since its only during the third one that technology has really come close to catching up with his ideas.And Jobs likes other people even if he treats them like shit. It would be nice if two of the three main women were more than two of Sorkins standard female character types -- the shrill mess (Waterston) and the loyal (self-described) work wife (Kate Winslet initially unrecognizable in dreadful 80s wear as Joanna Hoffman). But the characters who stop by to pay their respects and pick fights during Jobs rehearsals are all really just mirrors for different aspects of his personality -- most obviously Jeff Daniels as Apple CEO and then former Apple CEO John Sculley who in one of the most awkward lines in a sea of good ones asks Jobs how he feels about being adopted right before he goes onstage. View this image > Fassbender and Perla Haney-Jardine as 19-year-old Lisa Jobs. Francois Duhamel / Universal Pictures ID 7053793 Fassbender tenses up his voice and tones down his wolfishness for the role (though theres a moment where he slips into a toothy grin that feels like a shock) but the best thing he brings to the character is a sense of affected dispassion. Jobs sometimes genuinely doesnt care about the feelings of the person hes talking to or making demands of but other times shifts his attention as a power move a means of deflection.Its his main ammunition in his fractious relationship with his daughter Lisa (played by Makenzie Moss as a 5-year-old Ripley Sobo as a 9-year-old and Perla Haney-Jardine as a college-bound teenager) who Jobs initially insisted was not his in the ultimate denial of attention. Later in the movie hes aghast that she took him at face value when in a huff he told her he wouldnt pay for her Harvard tuition -- though from everything weve seen of their relationship it wouldnt seem out of the realm of possibility.The moment in which Jobs confesses to Lisa the truth about the name of an early project feels like a punch to the gut because of the depth of unrealized emotion it reveals. He cant even explain why his first urge was to repudiate his daughter and the fact that the movie doesnt try to solve this for him is one of the reasons its so satisfying despite its flashy self-conscious schematism. By the third act of the film Jobs has carved himself down into the iconic figure we all know with his black turtleneck rimless glasses and enticingly candy-colored transparent desktops. Hes going to finally be proven right like so many Sorkin heroes but theres an ache to his success -- not because of the things he gave up to get it but because hes finally figured out that he didnt have to.

I also dont know how much that matters. Not to draw an invidious comparison right off the bat but how much did Shakespeares ""Henry V"" have to do with the historical monarch who fought the battle of Agincourt?This film and Alex Gibneys highly critical but richly nuanced recent documentary ""Steve Jobs The Man in the Machine"" barely seem to be about the same person and brush against each other in only the most cursory ways. But the Boyle-Sorkin ""Steve Jobs"" is not a hagiography or a whitewashing. In fact its not a biopic at all. Although I found Fassbenders performance magnetic - the Irish actor gradually becomes Jobs through some mysterious metamorphosis despite looking almost nothing like him - the character we see backstage before three major product launches is frequently downright unpleasant and almost never resembles the sympathetic and ""relatable"" protagonist typically demanded by major motion pictures. If you find Steve Jobs relatable you may need professional help.Just as ""The Social Network"" was not about Facebook ""Moneyball"" was not about the Oakland Athletics and ""The West Wing"" was not about the White House ""Steve Jobs"" is not really about Steve Jobs or Apple Computer. Like nearly all of Sorkins work in movies and television its about the moral interaction between public performance and private behavior and about the difficulty many driven and talented people have in treating other human beings as if they mattered. Quite likely its a self-portrait to some degree although there I lapse into exactly the kind of amateur psychoanalysis that Sorkin will cheerfully tell you he indulges in every time he sits down to write.A few nights ago I moderated a conversation with Sorkin after a screening for the Writers Guild. Before laying out his psychological theory on Jobs - which is essentially that he was a profoundly damaged person who gradually came to understand how damaged he was - Sorkin hauled out a quip he has used many times before. ""When I say stuff like this you need to remember that I do hold a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in musical theater"" he said. ""So this isnt just coming from some guy off the street.""But that gag line contains buried meanings that are not superficial Sorkins writing is always theatrical and in this screenplay he has essentially boiled down Walter Isaacsons whopping Jobs biography into a trilogy of one-act plays. And his language is inherently musical The famous Sorkin ""walk and talk"" the overly lyrical expository monologue in which a character reveals his or her driving desires the zinger comeback uttered while leaving a room the finely balanced back and forth between a man and a woman. If anything ""Steve Jobs"" is so perfectly wrought and meticulously shaped a vessel that it leaves all verisimilitude behind and delivers a dramatic redemption or salvation that Steve Jobs never found in life. For most viewers that wont be a problem and this is simultaneously Sorkins most satisfying movie script and Boyles most graceful work as a directorMany fans of Apple and Jobs were puzzled to learn that Sorkin had taken just three incidents from Isaacsons authorized biography - three of Jobs product launches yes but none of the greatest hits. This movie ends in 1998 with Jobs return to Apple and the launch of the iMac the friendly ovoid blob that came in many colors and was described by Jobs daughter Lisa (in the movie at least) as ""Judy Jetsons Easy-Bake Oven."" There is no such thing as an iPhone still less an iPad and people who want to listen to music while they walk around have those clunky portable CD players. In one of his final scenes with Lisa Jobs tells her hes going to fix that problem which is probably a bit of Sorkin-esque cheating - the iPod was not launched for another three years.But the structure of ""Steve Jobs"" makes perfect sense once you understand that Sorkin is essentially not interested in the story of Steve Jobs as a technological innovator or a corporate visionary. Hes looking for moments of dramatic tension and personal crisis in a famous persons life and is entirely willing to fictionalize them for effect as was done in say the lives of the saints written by church historians centuries after their deaths. The moral spine of all three episodes in ""Steve Jobs"" is not Jobs relationship to his machines but his relationships with a ""West Wing""-style core group of people around him and especially with Lisa the illegitimate daughter whom he denied for years and resisted getting to know. You Might Also Like In the first act of the film its 1984 and Jobs is preparing to unveil the Macintosh desktop computer at the Flint Center in Cupertino California - then a relatively obscure Silicon Valley bedroom community and now famous all over the world as Apples hometown. The second chapter takes place four years later at the War Memorial Opera House in San Francisco after Jobs has been hounded out of Apple and is preparing to launch the NeXT an overpriced overdesigned and underpowered cube that was effectively a Trojan horse directed at his former company. Then we skip a full decade to Jobs reconquest of Apple and the iMac launch at Davies Symphony Hall just across the street. (All the locations are genuine and it really does make a difference.)Boyles design team doesnt go over the top with the 80s and 90s styles and signatures - although we certainly see oversize glasses and enormous shoulder pads - but each section of the film has a distinctive visual flavor. For the opening section in 1984 cinematographer Alwin H. Kuchler uses old-school 16mm film lending the scene a subtle grain and slightly washed-out colors. In 1988 we get the richness and sophisticated color palette of 35mm and for the late 90s Kuchler switches to the relentless digital clarity and ""contemporary"" feeling of the Arri Alexa.Theres a problem with the computer Jobs plans to unveil at the Flint Center It doesnt work. At least it doesnt say ""hello"" or not without a little backstage trickery and Jobs is utterly inflexible on this point. (That part Sorkin says is actually true.) As for the Apple founder who is about to risk his wunderkind reputation on a machine that will be a disastrous failure he doesnt want to say hello either. Not to the eager journalists not to the technical wizards he alternately berates and patronizes - Seth Rogen plays Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and Michael Stuhlbarg is software genius Andy Hertzfeld - and not to his ex-girlfriend Chrisanne Brennan (Katherine Waterston) or the little girl he insists is not his daughter. Chrisanne and Woz and Hertzfeld come and go throughout the movie as each is subjected to Jobs baleful glare and for obvious reasons Lisa is played by a different young actress in each section. Jobs confidante and antagonist and external voice of conscience throughout all three episodes is Apple marketing head Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet) constantly trying to make the angel-on-shoulder argument that he would still be Steve Jobs even if he stopped treating other people with vicious disregard. If Fassbender is almost never off screen - there are two brief shots where he is not visible - Winslet is present only slightly less and turns what could have been an overly ""womanly"" amanuensis role into a steely angry and ultimately irresistible force of ferocious power and emotion. If theres an Oscar in this cast beyond the one for which Fassbender will surely be nominated its hers.Another voice of normalcy from the outside world is supplied by Jeff Daniels as Apple CEO John Sculley whose role here is largely a Sorkin invention. In real life Sculleys famous falling out with Jobs after the Macintosh fiasco of 84 led first to the latters dismissal from Apple and then to the formers and the two men never spoke again. Sorkin says he had a lengthy email exchange with Sculley who is now retired in Florida and has never spoken publicly about his days at Apple and decided to give him a chance in dramatic form to say all the things he wanted to say to Steve Jobs but never did.Im perfectly fine with that decision largely because any chance to watch Daniels act is a chance worth taking and because Sorkins concocted confrontations between Jobs and Sculley are richly enjoyable. But it exemplifies the fact that ""Steve Jobs"" is a work of imagination and reinvention not of biography or history. Its a moral survey of American life on the cutting edge of the late 20th century as we wish it had happened (during the administration of President Jed Bartlet in effect) rather than as it did. Its a moving and magnificently crafted story about a person named Steve Jobs who was brought low by pride and arrogance and then redeemed by love. It might be a story that mirrors our dreams and desires which is what the real Steve Jobs did too and in that sense maybe its indirectly about him. Its definitely not about a guy who built and sold computers.""Steve Jobs"" opens this week in New York and Los Angeles with wider national release to follow beginning Oct. 23.

Share Tweet Its a scene straight from the Aaron Sorkin playbook A prickly smartass genius man explains to a naive female subordinate how coincidences work--and specifically how a coincidence is responsible for the genius computer project sharing her name. Only in this case the man performing the calmly rational condescension is Apple co-founder Steve Jobs (Michael Fassbender) and the female subordinate is his 5-year-old daughter who he refuses to acknowledge as such. Though even the child has touches of Sorkin in her voice this is not banter. Its chilly at best and cruelty at worst.Funny thing about Sorkin Oscar-winning screenwriter and creator of beloved TV shows plus The Newsroom When hes forced to remove the prospect of romance from his prickly genius chronicles his self-awareness seems to shoot way up. In Steve Jobs as in his award-winning work for The Social Network the lack of a quasi-screwball rom-com framework frees the characters from Sorkins notions of what constitutes endearing behavior and the supercharged one-upmanship of his dialogue fuels relationships with real give and take.Of course Social Network and Steve Jobs are also both about real-life technology pioneers; its possible that Sorkin simply couldnt ever lionize a real Great Man as much as the ones he creates for his TV shows. Its also possible that despite his past small-screen successes he works best as a screenwriter collaborating with directors who can tame his stubborn sometimes frustrating talent. Here that task falls to director Danny Boyle and his approach to the material is one of the major distinctions between this film and David Finchers take on The Social Network. Sorkin reaching back to his playwright roots devises a theatrical structure for his non-biography that doesnt seem immediately suited to Boyles kinetic talents. He dedicates the films two hours to essentially three extended sequences each set in the moments just before a major Jobs-driven product launch. In 1984 Jobs prepares to show off the Macintosh teased in the famous Super Bowl spot from earlier that year; in 1988 hes off on his own prepping the NeXT educational computer; and in 1998 hes back at Apple about to unveil the iMac (and in a slightly cheesy touch dropping a hint about the iPod to come). All three segments unfold in something like real time and feature recurring figures Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen) past Apple CEO John Sculley (Jeff Daniels) marketing guru Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet) and that pesky daughter Lisa (at 5 9 and 19). Little of the presentations themselves are shown; really this is another round of Sorkin backstage choreography (though Jobs only comes across as marginally more self-important and megalomaniacal than the cast and crew of Studio 60 On The Sunset Strip). It seems a bit confining for Boyle who may have made a movie about a guy trapped under a rock but certainly didnt limit his camera to that physical environment. He doesnt here either; each segment includes a brief cut-up flashback to an earlier episode in Jobs life adding a touch of Boyle montage to the Sorkin walk-and-talk rhythms. But even allowing himself to occasionally cut out of the limited timeframe Boyle does work in a more disciplined mode than usual. He uses a different format for each of the segments the warm graininess of 16mm film for the scrappiness of Apple circa 1984; crisper 35mm film for the corporate drama of 1988; and whiter more washed-out digital for the harsher lessons Jobs learns in 1998. Though the differences are clear the technique doesnt register as a gimmick; Boyle usually an exuberant showman doesnt call a lot of attention to his style here. Some of the flashiest filmmaking happens during the transitions as when the camera follows Lisa through the bowels of Carnegie Hall as the 1988 segment begins Bob Dylan playing on the soundtrack. (Another sign of Boyles discipline His usually eclectic soundtrack cuts are mostly Dylan this time around.)The tension between Boyles restless energy and Sorkins tendency to run in place drives the movie. It also reflects their version of Jobs who spends a lot of time trying to look beyond the immediate problems in front of him toward his next move--a quality the movie shows as both brilliant and damaging at once. (Sorkin also calls attention to his dramatic devices when he has Jobs remark that ""its like five minutes before each launch everyone goes to the bar gets drunk and tells me what they really think."") Fassbender was basically born to play these qualities simultaneously. More surprising is the electricity of his scenes opposite Rogen as the dorkier clunkier Wozniak who is cursed with a stronger sense of empathy and who needles Jobs to acknowledge people besides himself. He also spars well with Winslet in fine form as Hoffman. Really all of the actors give weight to Sorkins quips. For all of its snap and crackle Steve Jobs doesnt pack quite the same punch as The Social Network or for that matter Boyles best films. Sometimes Sorkins script seems to be imposing the deposition-heavy structure of his Facebook movie onto a story without any actual court proceedings and while the movie doesnt worship at the altar of its subject its jabs dont always have the sting of true revelation. The latter would be more of a problem if the movie made a serious attempt at definitive biography. What Boyle and Sorkin pull off in its place is smarter and trickier a portrait of a ""closed system"" man expressing himself imperfectly through consumer electronics.

Two years later ""Steve Jobs"" comes to the screen upgraded with a stronger lead actor better script and sharper direction but it too leaves us feeling like weve seen an incomplete portrait of a complicated man. Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (""The Social Network"") eschews the standard this-happened-then-that-happened structure that ""Jobs"" and countless other movies use to tell a life story but as Jobs himself demonstrated trying something new isnt necessarily the same as succeeding. The result is a movie that feels like a series of beautifully and meticulously crafted tiles in a half-finished mosaic; you can admire the pieces but still come away feeling like youve been deprived of the whole. See Video New Steve Jobs Trailer Emphasizes Drama of Creating Most Tectonic Shift to Status Quo... Ever Adapting Walter Isaacsons best-selling biography of the same title Sorkin and director Danny Boyle choose three significant moments in Jobs career as a prism through which to view his entire life and the key relationships in it the 1984 launch of the Macintosh the 1988 presentation of the ill-fated NeXT cube and the 1998 unveiling of the colorful iMac (a brightly-colored computer which one character disparagingly refers to as ""Judy Jetsons Easy-Bake oven""). As we see Jobs (played intensely by Michael Fassbender) prepare for these big public moments we get to know the people around him who love and/or hate him. Mostly the latter. By his side is his devoted aide-de-camp Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet) who seems to be the one person Jobs respects and might actually listen to. Chrisanne Brennan (Katherine Waterston) often shows up with young Lisa the daughter that Jobs never seems to completely acknowledge is his although his stance on her softens over the course of the film. Then theres Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen) the jovial nerd who tries fruitlessly to make Jobs a people person and to get him to acknowledge the creators of other Apple products less near and dear to Jobs heart; engineer Andy Hertzfeld (Michael Stuhlbarg) who operates in terror that the 1984 event might hit some snags before coming into his own as the years go by; and John Sculley (Jeff Daniels) the former Pepsi exec whom Jobs brought into the Apple fold which ultimately led to Sculleys famous expelling of Jobs from the company before Jobs came back and returned the favor. These product launches certainly bring with them substantial dramatic tension given all the things that could go wrong at any given moment and the millions of dollars that always seem to be on the line. And of all those backstage areas certainly give Sorkin lots of hallways for the writer to toss out some of his trademark walk-and-talk scenes. But unless youve read Isaacsons book (or heck even watched ""Jobs"") there are many blanks that ""Steve Jobs"" refuses to fill in for you. Sorkin weaves in as much exposition as he can without overburdening the capable cast but the three-launches structure never quite comes together in a way that assembles a complete picture. Also Read Trevor Noah Addresses Apple Backlash With Steve Jobs Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin If you come into the movie thinking of Jobs as a genius or a charlatan or a bastard or a visionary youll find evidence to bolster your point of view but not enough to change or complicate it. And if you arent particularly familiar with him at all you may find it difficult to connect dots that the movie just assumes you already know. Boyle and cinematographer Alwin H. Kuchler who previously collaborated on ""Sunshine"" match each segment to the computers themselves an earth-toned simplicity for the Macintosh glistening blacks and shadows for the NeXT and a bright sheen for the iMac. The bridging material between the three main segments gives editor Elliot Graham (""Milk"") a moment to shine but he keeps the proceedings taut throughout reminding us that Jobs himself is under the gun and watching the clock waiting for his moment to go onstage even though friends and enemies always seem to choose this time to engage in heavy conversation with him. Also Read 33 Best Picture Challengers in First Oscar Outlook The Martian Steve Jobs Bridge of Spies Fassbender has a challenging assignment here in that he has to bring the audience inside a person who remained maddeningly enigmatic even to the people closest to him. He evokes Jobs intelligence and cruelty in equal measures and even if he keeps us from solving the riddle of this larger-than-life figure he also keeps us watching. In true Thelma Ritter style Winslet makes what could have been a sidekick character into someone youd like to see anchor a whole other movie. Joanna coddles and tolerates Steves eccentricities and obsessions but she also knows when to put the hammer down. She and Fassbender can each hold the screen on their own but theyre great at give-and-take at listening and reacting to each other. See Photo First Look at Michael Fassbenders Cover of T The New York Times Style Magazine 8 Revelations (Exclusive) After three seasons of ""The Newsroom"" Daniels knows how to make Sorkins dialogue-y dialogue sound spontaneous but the real revelation here is Rogen hes played dramatic parts before but hasnt had that breakthrough moment that his friend Jonah Hill has experienced. Rogen going toe-to-toe with Fassbender as two old friends and collaborators having their big lets-get-it-all-out argument provides ""Steve Jobs"" with its most electrifying moment and confirms that this clown can play Hamlet when he feels like it. Played at ages 5 9 and 19 by Makenzie Moss Ripley Sobo and Perla Haney-Jardine respectively Lisa becomes the films conscience or at least the litmus test for Jobs humanity. Its a seamless performance that happens to be given by three actresses. This is the sort of film that leaves me admiring what it wanted to do more than what it accomplished and its one that merits a look for its impressive parts even though it falls short of a satisfying sum.

If youre interested in the rags-to-riches story of the late Steve Jobs the tech nerd who devoted his life to the digital revolution and self-destructed in the process then stay away from the cold bloodless and incomprehensible movie with the cut-the-crap-and-get-to-the-point title Steve Jobs. You will learn a lot more about him by watching the excellent and fascinating Alex Gibney documentary Steve Jobs The Man in the Machine--a much better movie and a far more revealing look at the person behind the enigma than anything in the fictionalized mess that has been clumsily directed by Danny Boyle and pretentiously written by Aaron Sorkin. Theres no humanity in this grave disappointment that justifies the passion his fans feel for the father of the iMac. Steve Jobs and all of the characters around him fail to come to life in any absorbing fashion. Theyre not real people; theyre all hashtags. STEVE JOBS  (1/4 stars) Written by Aaron Sorkin Directed by Danny Boyle Starring Michael Fassbender Kate Winslet and Seth Rogen Running time 122 min. At the press conference following the unveiling of Steve Jobs at the New York Film Festival last week Mr. Sorkin informed the audience he did not want to make a ""biopic."" This is the major problem of a movie infected with them. It fails to tell any story at all. How did a child who was ashamed of being adopted rise from loser to CEO of Apple? He may have revolutionized digital technology but he also weakened humanitys most valuable asset--the power of communication. How did he feel about that?  And what about his personal life? Inquiring minds want to know. If there is a story worth telling its a secret here. The movie touches on his rejection of the woman and child who claimed to be his only legal family although the truth is that he was married with three other children. These are facts that are never mentioned. And despite the immense charisma of Michael Fassbender (who looks nothing whatsoever like Jobs) in the title role and Kate Winslet as his tough smart and loyal right arm and head of Apple marketing (a totally fabricated composite of several people) the characters created by Mr. Sorkin are so faceless and one-dimensional that the supporting actors playing them (Jeff Daniels Alan Alda Seth Rogen and others) are as wasted as disposable Kleenex from a tissue box. What you do get is a character called Steve Jobs who embodies the qualities of a man who is not worth making a movie about. Cold obnoxious neurotic selfish indifferent toward everything but his computers (worth 441 million when his wife and daughter were living on welfare) and as cracked as the Apple logo. The structure designed by Mr. Sorkin to take place during three separate Apple product launches is so hard to keep up with that the characters show up in myriad costumes in the same scene. The show-off dialogue about profit margins and market shares and revolutionary Ethernets is so full of technological mumbo-jumbo it might as well be written in Swahili. Like Facebook guru Mark Zuckerberg Mr. Jobs comes off as so arrogant illogical unbearably unpleasant and self-absorbed to the point of self-delusion that he comes unhinged when somebody else writes a tuition check for his daughter at Harvard because it makes him sound like hes a poor role model. A mass of contradictions he manipulates the press insults his employees and shows indifference to other peoples opinions and feelings then loses it when a confidante suggests ""You can be gifted and decent at the same time"" But its a presumption a man as chilly as an ice bucket never comprehends. This is a movie in freefall. It never coheres or lands on two feet. I suppose one should respect its unconventional pacing and screwball screenplay and I suppose there are computer geeks out there who may very well care but there are millions of potential moviegoers who wont. Steve Jobs may be a film of great audacity. But any bogus entertainment that crams 19 years of computer technology into two hours of film without any identifiable human emotion character development or narrative coherence is not the kind of movie I could ever cuddle up with.

Steve Jobs is the case in point and ""Steve Jobs"" says no. A well-acted smartly written but ultimately somewhat pat profile of the personal-electronics pioneer it portrays him as a tyrannical control freak who bullies everyone around him in order to get things done. Is he a nice guy? Absolutely not. Is he a great man? The movie sure thinks so. The film is directed by Danny Boyle who previously gave us stories from ""Trainspotting"" to ""Slumdog Millionaire"" all marked by their visual panache. Although he switches film stocks creates some interesting compositions and sends the camera in pursuit of its constantly moving characters Boyles hand is less evident here. Instead the real auteur is for a change the actual author -- screenwriter Aaron Sorkin. In fact the most interesting thing about the film is its carefully structured script. Rather than do a straight and-then-this-happened biopic Sorkin divides the film into three acts each one built around a specific product launch. The gimmick? Rather than seeing Jobs famous spiels we stay backstage as - in real time - Jobs pumps himself up for his appearance handles last-minute glitches and faces various personal crises as one colleague or family member after another tells him off. Yet while this is certainly dramatic its not particularly cinematic. Sorkin started in the theater then jumped to Hollywood - and why not thats where the money is. But hes still writing plays all talk talk talk. Theres no imagery to his writing no revelatory action. He writes movies for the radio. Most actors dont mind that; they love the chance to get their teeth into a page of smart dialogue. Which is what allows him to attract people like Michael Fassbender (who plays Jobs) and Kate Winslet (who plays marketing head Joanna Hofman). Seth Rogen is here too as Steve Wozniak - a tech genius who seems like more of a mensch with every year. Winslets Eastern-European accent is a little wobbly in her first scene but she brings real nervous energy to the part. Rogen is particularly good and Fassbender is terrific - he has an icy containment onscreen and its perfect for Jobs a man who always thought he was the smartest person in the room (and was often but not always right). And its the actors who carry the movie. Winslet a nakedly emotional performer turns what could an artificial character - basically a stand-in for Jobs mostly silent conscience - into a real person. Jeff Daniels has a ball as John Sculley a top executive whose relationship with Jobs changes drastically with each act. They all grab their sometimes too-on-the-nose dialogue and turn it into drama. Yet ultimately theres a slight feeling of contrivance here and one of unearned forgiveness. The whole things as engineered as a schematic but just as ""The Social Network"" was designed to show Mark Zuckerberg as friendless and alone ""Steve Jobs"" is meant to show a man who learns something about himself. He never really apologizes for all his actions but thats OK. The film does it for him. But then thats not surprising. The Jobs is portrays isnt an artist but an administrator. Hes not someone who actually creates things; he creates teams and then turns them loose to create things. And then he outsources the production refines the packaging supervises the marketing and makes hundreds of millions of dollars while basking in the applause. And if hes not a people person? Screws up his personal relationships? Thats not his fault. So hes not a ""good guy."" Hes a great genius. Is it any wonder Hollywood loves him? Ratings note The film contains strong language.

"Review Steve Jobs is smart energetic compelling just like the man - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Steve Jobs is smart energetic compelling just like the man Steve Jobs movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews Steve Jobs starring Michael Fassbender. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews Steve Jobs starring Michael Fassbender. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter Compelling subject. Fast-paced exhilarating dialogue. Focused direction that maintains an almost ruthless pace. Acting that couldnt be more assured.It has to be ""Steve Jobs."" Written by Aaron Sorkin directed by Danny Boyle starring Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslet (with expert support from Seth Rogen Jeff Daniels Michael Stuhlbarg and Katherine Waterston) ""Steve Jobs"" is a smart hugely entertaining film that all but bristles with crackling creative energy. What it is not is a standard biopic.SIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter gt;gt; As anyone whos seen Alex Gibneys recent documentary ""Steve Jobs The Man in the Machine"" can testify this dramatic feature is no more an accurate record of the celebrated digital entrepreneurs life than Shakespeares ""Macbeth"" tells the real story of the 11th century Scottish ruler. See the most-read entertainment stories gt;gt;Open link Rather as the filmmakers acknowledge this is a dramatization of a life an impressionistic construct that makes such rich theatrical use of the real building blocks of Jobs existence that it convinces us of at least its emotional reality.The word ""theatrical"" is used advisedly because Sorkin not only has written bold heightened dialogue but daringly structured ""Steve Jobs"" as more or less a three-act play each one focused on the 40 minutes before a trio of Jobs product launches the Macintosh in 1984 the NeXTcube in 1988 and the iMac in 1998.In each case the same five key people in Jobs life seek him out to verbally spar with this creative force who for different reasons is central to all of them. As the man himself awash in frustration sums it up ""Five minutes before every launch people get drunk and tell me whats wrong with me."" Steve Jobs trailer Watch an official trailer for ""Steve Jobs."" Watch an official trailer for ""Steve Jobs."" See more videos Sorkins dialogue is as good as it gets (he wrote ""The West Wing"" and won an Oscar for ""The Social Network"") but putting it on screen in a vigorous involving way can be a challenge and no one could be better at meeting that than Boyle.A director so kinetic he was able to make a film out of ""127 Hours"" the story of a man trapped and immobile in a cave for all that time Boyle is expert at making the potentially static visually interesting.Boyle and cinematographer Alwin Kuchler envisioned ""Steve Jobs"" as a film with lots of walking and talking (stalwart Steadicam operator Geoffrey Haley saw considerable action) and even shot each of the three acts in a different visual format The 1984 launch of the Mac was done on 16-millimeter film 1988s NeXT event was shot on 35 millimeter and 1998s iMac launch was shown via the digital ALEXA system.Also understanding how much work it would be to gain command of Sorkins language (the actors used words like ""rhythm"" ""cadence"" and ""pace"" to describe it) Doyle not only shot the story in sequence he made time for weekslong rehearsal periods before each section was filmed.Starting ""Steve Jobs"" off is a remarkable moment set in none of these time periods. Its a 1974 Australian Broadcasting Corp. interview with Arthur C. Clarke in which the futurist uncannily predicts that there will be small computers in everyones home connecting them to the world a vision that Jobs labored as much as anyone to make real.Though the film he stars in is very much a group effort it is hard to imagine ""Steve Jobs"" without the magnetic Fassbender who eats parts like this for breakfast in the starring role.His Jobs is a man of enormous self-confidence driven like nobodys business whose powers of persuasion are so overpowering his employees talk about the ""reality distortion field"" he is able to create around himself and his ideas.The drama begins on the morning of the Mac launch in 1984. Jobs is flat-out furious with key development team member Andy Hertzfeld (Stuhlbarg) because the machine does not want to say hello as its supposed to and Jobs wants it fixed. Now.""Were not a pit crew at Daytona"" Hertzfeld protests. When Jobs shoots back ""Youve had three weeks the universe was created in a third of that time"" Hertzfeld is given the rare last word ""Someday youre going to have to tell us how you did it.""Looking on is Joanna Hoffman (Winslet) Macintoshs marketing chief and something of a Steve Whisperer the only person who can speak truth to Jobs on a consistent basis. ""Do you want to try being reasonable just to see what it feels like?"" she asks him adding ""If you keep alienating people for no reason there wont be anyone left for it to say hello to.""The films Hoffman Winslet has said is something of a composite of several women who were key at Apple but the actress plays her with a thrilling specificity as she and Fassbender go head to head like opera stars throwing themselves into legendary duets.""Steve Jobs"" the man and the film use Hoffman as a gatekeeper someone who has a key voice in who gets to see the great man. Those allowed in include Steve Wozniak (Rogen) the Apple co-founder who was the companys inside man and whom Jobs alternately patronizes and protects. Someone who believes ""you can be decent and gifted at the same time"" Wozniak finds not for the first time that pushing Jobs to do what he doesnt want to do is fruitless.In essence learning the same lesson albeit in a very different way is John Sculley (Daniels) whose time as Apple chief executive starts smoothly but soon goes south when like Wozniak he pursues an agenda not to the great mans liking. Where Jobs is most vulnerable though you wouldnt know it at first is in his dealings with Chrisann Brennan (Waterston) his former long-term girlfriend and the mother of Lisa the daughter he vociferously denies is his.As we follow Jobs over these 14 years his relationship with the computer world and these key individuals morphs and changes in absorbing ways and none more so than with Lisa who is played by a trio of actresses (Makenzie Moss Ripley Sobo Perla Haney-Jardine) as she ages. It is in the family arena that Jobs finally proves to be the most vulnerable though that is a relative term where he is concerned. That underneath all the posturing and bravado Steve Jobs was human after all is something this shooting star of a movie never lets us forget.MORE Steve Jobs gets as much attention for Aaron Sorkin as for Steve JobsOscar Watch The Martian Steve Jobs and Bridge of Spies make their cases With Steve Jobs truths about the Apple co-founder in three installments Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Steve Jobs Danny Boyle Kate Winslet Michael Fassbender Apple Inc.

On that basis score a triumph for Steve Jobs written directed and acted to perfection and so fresh and startling in conception and execution that it leaves you awed. Michael Fassbender rips through the role of the volcanic Apple co-founder and CEO who sucked at personal interaction but soared at transmogrifying personal computing and everything digital from music animation (Pixar) and publishing to those iPhones we wear like a second skin. Fassbenders Jobs is a tornado of roaring ferocity and repressed feeling. Hes also charming and seductively funny which makes him dangerous if you get too close. Fassbender gives a towering performance of savage wit and limitless firepower. Is he really that good? Hell yeah. More News Danny Boyle on Steve Jobs Sorkin amp; the Fassbender Effect Fall Movie Preview 2015 From James Bond to Star Wars iTunes 10th Anniversary How Steve Jobs Turned the Industry Upside Down Get to Know Your Difficult Men Biopics All Stories >> Related Steve Jobs and Why Movies Cant Capture Genius How the biopic on Apple cofounder is the latest film that fails to nail the elusive quality -- and why it may not matter The script by Aaron Sorkin an Oscar winner for The Social Network is sheer brilliance. Sorkin didnt so much follow Walter Isaacsons bestselling Jobs biography as absorb it into his DNA and release it with a daring structure and point of view all his own. Sorkin divides the movie into three time frames each filmed in different formats by the gifted cinematographer Alwin Kuchler and each involving the launch of a new Jobs product. The first part shot on low-res 16mm film is set in 1984 in Cupertino California where Jobs 29 debuts the Macintosh. The second part presented on widescreen 35mm unfurls at the sleek San Francisco Opera House in 1988 when Jobs axed by Apple presents his NeXT cube to mass indifference. The final part utilizing high-def digital takes place in 1998 at San Franciscos Davies Symphony Hall where Jobs back calling the shots at Apple gives the iMac its famed send-off. Dazed by the tech-speak and whirling innovations? Sorkin offers no sympathy. Echoing Jobs rush to the next big thing Sorkin counts on you to keep up. Its a challenge worth taking. Cheers to master filmmaker Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire Trainspotting 127 Hours) for directing Sorkins three-act play with the hurtling speed of a white-knuckle thriller. Boyle also knows how to fill the spaces between words so they reveal the emotions of the multitudes who come and go in Jobs hectic life. Sorkin moves characters around his cinematic chessboard (shades of Birdman) with little regard to whether they were actually present during Jobs backstage rampages. Still their actions and reactions have the ring of harsh abstract truth. The actors could not be better as they thrust and parry over 14 years with the man who compares himself to Julius Caesar an emperor surrounded by enemies. A superb Seth Rogen finds the bruised heart in Steve ""Woz"" Wozniak the Apple co-founder who cant laugh off Jobs refusal to credit his team with the success of the Apple II computer. Michael Stuhlbarg shows us the pain in software developer Andy Hertzfeld who suffers the wrath of Jobs for failing to make the Mac prototype say ""hello."" And Jeff Daniels an iconic Sorkin interpreter on HBOs The Newsroom nails every nuance as John Sculley the Apple CEO who fires Jobs and sparks his cruel revenge. Can anyone tame this perfectionist beast? Polish-born marketing chief Joanna Hoffman comes close. As played by the glorious Kate Winslet award-caliber and radiating grit and grace Hoffman is the one person ready to give shit to the boss. She berates Moneybags for letting his former lover Chrisann Brennan (Katherine Waterston) live on welfare and for denying paternity of their five-year-old daughter Lisa (Makenzie Moss). Nine-year-old Lisa (Ripley Sobo) gets closer to the old man. But its not until 19-year-old Lisa (a stellar Perla Haney-Jardine) fights her controlling withholding dad on his terms that Jobs takes his first real steps toward her. Related From raging bulls to lizard kings we look back at the great (and the grating) movies that took on true-life stories Sorkin never goes soft on his protagonist an adopted child with an ugly streak built to keep those closest to him at a distance. But Fassbender lets us see flickers of humanity. What we dont see is the older even richer Jobs who married Laurene Powell had three children created more Apple miracles fought the pancreatic cancer eating away at his body and died in 2011 at age 56. Steve Jobs the movie aims to catch the man at three public points when people who defined their lives in relation to his showed up at the last minute to give him holy hell. Harsh? Yes. But essential to a film about a pioneer who created products with a slick spotless veneer to hide all the tangled circuits inside. In Steve Jobs sure to rank with the years very best films we see the circuits without ever diminishing the renegade whose vision is still changing our digital lives.

Photo Universal Pictures MOVIE REVIEW Steve Jobs Running time 122 minutes. Rated R (profanity). ""Steve Jobs"" is a tale of two men not one A more accurate not to say wittier title would have been ""Steve Jobs and Aaron Sorkin."" Sorkins Jobs played with riveting intensity by Michael Fassbender is essentially the same character as Sorkins Mark Zuckerberg exasperating uncompromising shockingly uncaring -- a backside aperture of a man who must ultimately be forgiven because of his undisputed genius. On another level the film has the aroma of a new chapter of Aaron Sorkins autobiography. Yet the film directed by Danny Boyle from Sorkins 800-gigaherz script isnt as strong as ""The Social Network."" Focusing on the moments before three product launches (in 1984 1988 and 1998) Sorkin has written a three-act play that though frequently funny insightful and even brilliant also can be airless. It gets bogged down in for instance several long disquisitions on whether Jobs will bow to requests from his former partner Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen making no effort to be anyone but Seth Rogen) to publicly credit the Apple II team. This isnt an interesting enough question to cover repeatedly. Seth RogenPhoto Universal Pictures Yet with the elegance of an Apple design Sorkin has crammed an astonishing amount of material -- financial and technical information boardroom squabbles Jobs feelings about being adopted and his distaste for fatherhood -- into the three backstage episodes. Jobs fretting (in 1984) about getting the Mac to say ""Hello"" when he is about to unveil it to the public blends artfully into his arguments with his ex-girlfriend (Katherine Waterston) about his paternity of her 5-year-old daughter Lisa (Makenzie Moss) with his demands to his head marketer Joanna (a superb Kate Winslet) and with the fond banter he swaps with his CEO John Sculley (nicely played by Jeff Daniels) a father figure right down to the first name he shared with the billionaires actual father. Michael Fassbender and Makenzie MossPhoto Francois Duhamel/Universal Pictures via AP The opening act is electricity itself crackling with Sorkins superb one-liners but the momentum slows in the second act. In 1988 Jobs ties himself to a big black boulder called the NeXT Computer and throws it over a cliff. I suppose failure can tell you a lot about a man but lets not confuse the footnotes with the main story. In the third act as Jobs unveils the beautiful iMac and finally admits to his daughter that he named the Lisa computer after her the film recovers a bit but many of the subjects discussed have already been covered earlier. Where are the iPods and iPhones that would transform Apple from merely a computer manufacturer to Earths most valuable company? Where is the bizarre denialism of his fatal illness? Where is any mention of his wife Laurene? Its a cliche to say that Apple changed the world but how and why did that happen? ""Steve Jobs"" is robust and entertaining but the answer it provides is incomplete.

But whose version of Jobs are we supposed to believe? Was he a Zen Edison visionary who gave technology its soul? Or was he a prickly self-promoting narcissist who ruled through humiliation and fear? In Danny Boyles kaleidoscopic new biopic Steve Jobs hes both equal parts beautiful mind and bully. In one of the best most revealing lines in Aaron Sorkins screenplay Jobs (played brilliantly by Michael Fassbender) admits after being called out by a mistreated friend ""Im poorly made."" Even in a rare introspective moment Jobs seemed to regard himself as an insanely great machine with a flawed operating system. Adapted by Sorkin from Walter Isaacsons 2011 biography Boyles film unspools like an impressionistic triptych focusing on the unveiling of three of Jobs most important product launches the Macintosh in 1984 his calamitous NeXT computer in 1988 and the first iMac in 1998 when he triumphantly returned like a prodigal son to the company he founded in a garage with his childhood pal Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen). For the most part this structure works. Each chapter symbolizes a critical crossroads in Jobs career. And Boyle whos always been one of our most playful visual stylists shoots each section using different film stocks (16mm 35mm and digital) to subliminally reboot the audiences expectations. Every section crackles with exquisite rat-a-tat dialogue (Sorkin has no peer in this regard with the possible exception of Preston Sturges 70 years ago) but theres something too mannered and convenient in this three-part setup. In each of the films chapters as Jobs frantically prepares to debut his latest gee-whiz gadget for an auditorium full of Apples Kool-Aid-drinking zealots he locks verbal horns with the same six characters. Theres Rogens Wozniak whos tired of being the Ringo to Jobs John Lennon; Apples onetime chairman John Sculley (Jeff Daniels); Jobs browbeaten chief programmer Andy Hertzfeld (Michael Stuhlbarg); his marketing head and confidante Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet); and his ex (Katherine Waterston) whose daughter Lisa becomes the films Rosebud as Jobs struggles to acknowledge his paternity. Each appears backstage before every launch but theyre more like triggering devices than real people. I happen to be one of those folks who think theres nothing easier on the ear than a florid Sorkin walk-and-talk with its metaphorical arias and smartypants speeches. But it works better on a sitcom than in a biopic that has some responsibility of capturing reality. Maybe thats why as sharp and slick as Steve Jobs is it ends up feeling more interested in entertainment than enlightenment.

Credit Francois Duhamel/ Universal Pictures 3 (out of 4) ""You can be decent and gifted at the same time"" That line of dialogue written by Aaron Sorkin could have been lifted from his film The Social Network to describe Mark Zuckerberg. Instead a man named Steve Wozniak barks it to his former partner Apple mastermind Steve Jobs in a movie so whip-smart and engrossing that you wont even think about checking that iPhone in the theater. (It premiered Oct. 3 at the 53rd annual New York Film Festival and will be released in New York and Los Angeles on Oct. 9.) By the way if you thought Zuckerberg came off as a detached jerk in Sorkins Oscar-winning screenplay just wait. This tech genius is significantly more flawed. PHOTOS Stars who transformed for movie roles Now forget about every biopic youve ever seen -- including the middling 2013 Jobs which starred Ashton Kutcher in the title role. This one isnt interested in a straightforward narrative in which an adopted college dropout builds a computer out of his garage becomes a multi-billionaire and dies of cancer in 2011 at age 56. No. Sorkin and director Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire) put the focus squarely on the backstage drama leading up to three major product launches. Unfolding in real time its staged like an intense three-act play . . . and theres no doubt it will be one day. We begin in 1984 when Steve (Michael Fassbender) prepares to debut the MacIntosh computer in Cupertino California. (Boyle shoots this on a grainy home video-like camera giving it a nifty aged look.) About 40 minutes before go-time hes panicked because the screen on display cant ""say hello"" to the shareholders. In short order his VIPs step into the picture. He strategizes with his trusty marketing head Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet); orders his chief engineer Andy Hertzfeld (Michael Stuhlbarg) to fix the glitch; bitterly feuds with his ex-girlfriend Chrisann Brennan (Katherine Waterston) over the paternity of her 5-year-old daughter Lisa; bristles with ""Woz"" (Seth Rogen) about whether he should thank the Apple II team in his speech; and clinks glasses with his CEO John Sculley (Jeff Daniels). PHOTOS Summer 2015 movie hunks Get to know this cast of characters They also appear right before the 1988 NeXT system and 1998 iMac unveilings. This unusual and admittedly confining structure is bound to polarize. Indeed it can be jarring to absorb decades worth of information -- including the apparently messy breakup from Brennan -- in high-speed dialogue snips. Its up to you to deduct how the two Steves went from the garage to the Cupertino auditorium in the 1980s and how Lisas relationship with her father developed in the 1990s. Sorkin might also come under fire for taking obvious artistic liberties in the script. Though based on Walter Isaacsons bestselling (and cooperative) memoir of the same name the film plays loose with many of its anecdotal details. That book never described how Jobs hinted about the iPod to Lisa in a parking lot. Heck Hoffman was retired by 1998 and shes a key player in Act 3. PHOTOS Recent Oscar winners And yet it computes. Judging by all those millions of YouTube hits most everyone is already familiar with the dynamic speaker who rhapsodized in a black turtleneck tight jeans and white New Balance sneakers. Here as Jobs interacts with the people closest to him at watershed moments we get to see what makes him tick literally behind the scenes. Just hearing him snidely explain to Chrisann in 1984 that based on his algorithm theres a 28 percent chance hes not Lisas father speaks volumes. The same goes for his condescending treatment of the good-hearted Woz. He actually calls him ""little buddy."" Besides to paraphrase the old company slogan. . . . Sorkin thinks different. He writes in distinct syncopated rhythm that sounds like a verbal concerto. Every sentence is meticulously constructed in such a way that even if you dont particularly like what the characters are saying youll still want to listen to the music. All the performers beautifully play their instrument. The amazing Fassbender on screen every moment transforms into Jobs. No matter that he scarcely resembles the man -- he captures the essence. Count on Oscar nominations for him Rogen and Winslet. PHOTOS Before they were stars The brainy film could just use more heart. Its clear that Jobs is gifted at making groundbreaking things even though he is himself poorly made. Nonetheless the unlikeable factor rates high. He perpetually comes off as an arrogant SOB unapologetic about his disdain for human connection. By the time he realizes that personal relationships are vital the payoff is slight. Even if theres truth to this characterization it doesnt explain why Hoffman would be so loyal. Or why Lisa would want to live with him. Or why hed inspire his Apple underlings to greatness. We already see the temperamental genius; we need more dimension within the man. Too much to ask for Act 4? Cant get enough of Us?

Photo Universal Pictures via AP As masterfully played by Michael Fassbender in this weekends New York Film Festival centerpiece ""Steve Jobs"" the late iconic Apple founder is the ultimate Boss from Hell an arrogant monster who goes out of his way to torment and embarrass even his most loyal and talented associates. In this horror-movie-style biopic Jobs even pushes away the 6-year-old daughter he initially refuses to acknowledge (despite a positive DNA test) -- Jobs wont even admit that he named his Lisa computer after her until well after hes sure she might have inherited some of his genius. Danny Boyles ""Steve Jobs"" makes ""The Social Network"" -- another acidic portrayal of an arrogant tech genius with ice water instead of blood in his veins also written by Aaron Sorkin that ended up losing in Oscars major categories -- look positively warm and fuzzy by comparison. ""Steve Jobs currently ranks No. 2 (behind the journalism docudrama ""Spotlight) among the Oscar pundits at Gold Derby with Fassbender leading the Best Actor field over Leonardo DiCaprio in the as-yet-unseen ""The Revenant. Aaron Sorkin accepts the Oscar for best adapted screenplay for ""The Social Network.""Photo AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill But its not hard to imagine ""Steve Jobs following a similar awards trajectory as ""The Social Network -- acclaim and prizes from critics and several Oscar nominations including for Fassbender Kate Winslet (playing Jobs marketing director and confidante who is constantly trying to get him to do the right thing and suffering abuse for it) Sorkins script and possibly even Best Picture. I dont think it will land the really big awards on Oscar night though. Audiences outside the two coasts (Universal has scrapped plans for a nationwide opening next Friday sending it into just nine theaters to build buzz before going wide on Oct. 23) and Oscar voters (particularly the largest branch the actors) may have trouble embracing a film so cold it should require a frostbite warning. There will also be the inevitable and probably justified attacks on the accuracy of a film (based on Walter Isaacsons best-selling biography) that so relentlessly focuses on what the filmmakers consider the negative aspects of Jobs personality that it will be labeled a hit job. Thats a bit of a surprise given that director Danny Boyle (""Slumdog Millionaire) who replaced ""Social Network director David Fincher during preproduction over reported budget issues is much more of a humanist than Fincher. Michael FassbenderPhoto Mike Marsland/WireImage But attempts to humanize Jobs in the films final segment -- set before the wildly successful launch of the iMac after Jobs return to Apple in 1998 -- feel half-hearted at best unconvincing at worst. They dont begin to take away the sour taste from the characters unremitting bile-spewing in the two earlier segments that take place in 1984 (preceding the launch of the Macintosh whose financial failure led to Jobs ouster from Apple) and 1988 (when Jobs launched the unsuccessful NeXT company portrayed as little more than a sham designed to allow him to retake control of Apple). The earlier segments are often even photographed like a horror movie centering on Fassbenders Jobs as an unfeeling monster who insults and betrays John Sculley the Apple CEO he personally recruited; repeatedly blows off Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen) as second-rate; threatens to publicly humiliate his chief engineer (Michael Stuhlbarg); and worst of all makes the mother (Katherine Waterston) of his daughter (whom he blames for him losing a Time magazine cover when her existence surfaces) grovel for more money when she and the child are both living on welfare. Steve JobsPhoto CNN Films ""Steve Jobs pays little attention to the subjects genius. It is more interested in the filmmakers theory that he lacked empathy because his original adoptive parents rejected him -- and because Jobs ego was so massive he felt his sheer genius gave him the right to write checks in lieu of ever saying he was sorry. Though the latter years of Jobs life (including his biggest triumphs) are not even mentioned I came away with the feeling that the makers of ""Steve Jobs were practically implying Jobs early death at 56 was some kind of karmic payback. Thats really harsh and I dont think Oscar buyers are going to buy it.

Adapting Walter Isaacsons biography of the Apple innovator -- and covering much of the same ground as Alex Gibneys documentary Steve Jobs The Man in the Machine -- Sorkins latest is less a novel expose than a distinctly Sorkinian dramatization of well-known material. Still its helmed with whip-smart panache by Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire 127 Hours Trainspotting) and boasts a backstage-drama structure that invites comparisons to last years inferior Birdman. This is a swift and searing attempt to pull back the curtain on Jobs and in the process investigate the relationship between the myth and the man.Like Sorkins Facebook film Steve Jobs casts its protagonist (here portrayed by Michael Fassbender) in ironic terms as a man who triumphantly connected millions of people both through and to technology and yet couldnt himself figure out how best to interact with others. That dichotomy is underlined at the outset by an archival clip of author Arthur C. Clarke laying out a forecast to a father and son of the computers to come and our online techno-future. And it serves as the foundation for Sorkins tale here broken down into three chapters each set at gala product launches. The film offers a rise-fall-rise narrative arc of both a personal and professional sort charting Jobss efforts to change the world with his era-defining home computers but also his gradual transformation from an unrepentantly prickish and selfish mad genius to one whos ever so slightly less unrepentantly prickish and selfish.Film Details Steve Jobs RatingR GenreDrama Running Time122 min. More Info Trailer Thats not to say that Steve Jobs is a hatchet job aimed at cutting its larger-than-life subject down to a more manageable size. If anything focusing on Jobss flaws makes him seem even grander albeit not necessarily in the nicest way. Here Jobs comes off as a distinctly difficult sort beginning at 1984s debut of the Macintosh at a Cupertino community college mere days after the premiere of Apples famous Super Bowl commercial directed by Ridley Scott. Fassbenders Jobs notes that it has been dubbed ""the greatest ad of all time."" He also yells at and humiliates programmer Andy Hertzfeld (Michael Stuhlbarg) for failing to get the Mac to say ""Hello"" for its demo. Jobs views that articulation as vital given his consuming belief in technology not as IBM-cold and impersonal but as warm inviting and inherently human.The idea that computers should be a reflection and extension of their users is central to Jobss ethos and Steve Jobs makes it plain that Apples own products -- created as minimalist ""closed systems"" that cant be opened up and modified -- have been fashioned in their fussy perfectionist unyielding makers flawed-yet-inspired likeness. Such qualities are evident in Jobss demands on his staff including his wifely right-hand woman Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet). And theyre even more apparent in his refusal to acknowledge his paternity to daughter Lisa. That proves a source of constant conflict with Jobss baby-mama Chrisann Brennan (Katherine Waterston) who in the films opening segment rips her former flame for slandering her in the press as a whore (courtesy of a ludicrous paternity algorithm he concocted). She only backs off temporarily once Jobs consents to her child-support wishes -- which he does after being moved by Lisas natural intuitive interfacing with the Macintoshs paint program.This introductory sequence is staged by Boyle with a laser-focused fleetness and precision that -- light-years removed from Birdmans single-take gimmickry -- proves in tune with Sorkins trademark rat-a-tat-tat verbal volleying. That also goes for other passages in the film such as Jobss disastrous 1988 presentation of a perfectly square educational computer for his new firm NeXT and then his triumphant 1998 return to Apple to unveil the iMac. Boyles technique effectively mirrors his main character embodied by Fassbender not with the tics of an impersonator but through a convincing attitude of calculating detachment ambition and ruthlessness. He doesnt look like the man but he feels like him inhabiting Jobs so fully and zealously that the lack of resemblance proves no distraction.Sorkins screenplay glibly suggests that Jobss upbringing as an adopted child might be the root of his less congenial traits and his need for admiration and validation as when he fumes over what he considers being snubbed by Time magazine for its ""Man of the Year."" In the film Jobss familial hang-ups extend past his fractured bond with Lisa to his bitter enmity toward onetime Apple CEO John Sculley (Jeff Daniels) the father of the disastrous ""Newton"" device and a paternalistic thorn in Jobss my-way-or-the-highway side. Then theres his contentious brotherly relationship with original colleague Steve ""Woz"" Wozniak who shows up in all three chapters of Steve Jobs to vainly request that Jobs give the original Apple II team some public credit. A bearded Seth Rogen plays Wozniak as something akin to a sad discarded Teddy Ruxpin -- and thus perhaps the inspiration for the Jobs-founded Pixars Toy Story?Mercifully Steve Jobss flirtation with facile psychoanalyzing is offset by its blistering barrage of combative dialogue all spoken in dressing rooms offices auditorium corridors and other locales fit for incessant movement. At lightning speeds the talk details reams of biographical information internal and external character dynamics and tectonic sociocultural-evolutionary shifts with a sharp sense of humor and an incisive understanding that reality and legend are often hopelessly intertwined -- and that a mans shortcomings can elucidate without diminishing his visionary greatness.Steve Jobs Directed by Danny Boyle Universal Pictures Opens October 9 Directed by Danny Boyle.

First in the Sorkin-written David Fincher-directed ""The Social Network"" Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg went from quirky Harvard nerd to friendless billionaire changing the way people connected for better and worse. Now in Sorkins new film directed by Danny Boyle and premiering at the Telluride Film Festival on Saturday Steve Jobs goes from Apple inventor to Apple reject to Apple savior. Those of us who grip our iPhones type on our MacBooks listen to our iTunes and tap on our iPads know the story of Apple. We know these beautiful items were credited after Jobs was brought back to save the company hed co-founded from bankruptcy. We also know the withered cancer victim who fought back death until it finally carried him under. See video Steve Jobs Full-Length Trailer Features Michael Fassbender Conducting Tech Orchestra (Video) This film isnt about that story. It isnt about nature casually discarding even the most valued among us. As Bob Marley was quoted as saying ""All the money in the world cant buy you a minute more of life."" Sorkins ""Steve Jobs"" is about how we measure success and failure. Jobs could not really achieve greatness without recognizing the most important thing in his life his biological daughter Lisa Brennan. His success could not be measured by the pretty toys alone. His success must come from his willingness to connect with his own flesh and blood. In the film much is made of Jobs own adoption as a main reason he has so much trouble with his own daughter. This damaged relationship is played out alongside Jobs career highs and lows. None of his successes will matter in the end if he cant do the right thing which means more than just writing a check. That is probably the most surprising thing of all -- how Boyle and Sorkin launched an excavation to find Steve Jobs heart. See video Steve Jobs The Man in the Machine Review Stunning Peek at Apple Legends Dark Sides Boyles version of Steve Jobs looks very different from what original director David Finchers would have looked like. Its impossible to say whether Boyles is better than Finchers would have been. Boyle gives the film over to the writing and to the films lead performance a stunning knockout by Michael Fassbender as Jobs. Boyle gives us breathtaking shots of Jobs in various stages of his professional life. He filmed the whole thing in three different theaters in San Francisco and much of the action is confined to those spaces. Boyle is strong on humanity in his work which helps explain why this telling of Jobs life is rooted so deeply in the women hes surrounded himself with -- chief among them Kate Winslet as Joanna Hoffman who was key in helping Jobs hold his business together. She is work wife mother figure teacher. Winslet has one of the films best scenes where she cant watch this man mistreat his daughter for one more minute. Either fix it she says or Ill go work ... ""anywhere I want."" See video Aretha Franklin Speaks Out on Telluride Injunction Justice Respect Prevails Fassbender spits out Sorkins dialogue like an ice cube maker -- each withering insult sticking its landing. Jobs suffered no fools. This is not a story that sugar coats his past. He is in many ways a monster who feeds on ego and builds machines that do not cooperate with other machines but are closed systems onto themselves. Fassbenders Jobs is focused on one thing making his work a success. What friendships he has are mostly about his work. He isnt freed from the theater to go live his life not ever. What life? Jobs has nothing but Apple. That is until he eventually figures out that there is one thing he helped bring into the world. He has to change to access that primal human relationship. ""Steve Jobs"" has the look and feel of a three act play with a stage a backstage an adoring crowd and lots and lots and lots and LOTS of dialogue. Sorkin and Boyle have found a way to tell this familiar story as a kind of talk opera. Dramatic speech and monologues take up so much room there isnt much left for anything else. Its a high wire act that might leave some feeling left behind. Somehow though Boyle pulls it off not by backing off the speechifying but by leaning into it and allowing it to sing. See video Suffragette Telluride Review Carey Mulligan Is the Reason to See This Masterwork Boyle brings out memorable turns by the supporting actors among them Seth Rogen as Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and Jeff Daniels as company CEO John Sculley. As is almost always the case with Sorkins work they are all speaking the same language drawn from the same rhythm and vocabulary. To some this is Sorkin overkill but the same could be said for the best of them David Mamet Edward Albee Paddy Chayefsky and even William Shakespeare. Sorkin is not trying to do anything but write in his own style thus this film and its exceptional dialogue leaves its mark as profoundly as Jobs himself left his. Boyle is not working with his usual team on ""Steve Jobs"" with a suspenseful score by Daniel Pemberton and cinematography by Alwin H. Kuchler. The British director is trying something new here making a film built almost entirely on dialogue. This is a film made up of what Boyle calls ""gestures"" to the real people involved. They arent trying to make a biopic here but rather a kind of symbolic ongoing conflict between the icon and the man. There are playful moments in the film and emotional highs that catch you off guard. Boyles enthusiasm and zest for life combined with Sorkins energy and verbal swordplay make ""Steve Jobs"" breathtaking and relentless at the same time.

We want them to emerge as gods not monsters. We want them to tell their story of success celebrating the tenets of the American dream. We need that dream to come true. A film like this one is a reminder that you cant pick and choose the builders of this country or that dream. They are sometimes broken people whose humanity is buried underneath layers of ambition. When the spark of genius does emerge however one can do nothing but stand back and applaud with admiration a man who could do that much with his imagination.

TWITTER Michael Fassbender plays the Apple CEO in the new film from director Danny Boyle and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin. How do you get to the bottom of a character like Steve Jobs a figure so towering and complex that he could arguably serve as the basis of a film as ambitious as Citizen Kane? If youre a dramatist with the character insight and verbal dexterity of Aaron Sorkin you make him the vortex of a swirling human hurricane the puppet master who kept all around him on strings the impresario of a circus dedicated to the creation and dramatic unveiling of technological wonders that changed the world. Racing in high gear from start to finish Danny Boyles electric direction temperamentally complements Sorkins highly theatrical three-act study which might one day be fascinating to experience in a staged setting. With its high-profile launches at the Telluride New York and London film festivals this Universal release is clearly positioned as one of the prestige titles of the fall season and will be high priority viewing for discerning audiences around the world. Read more The Danish Girl Venice Review Conceptually Sorkins work is structured like a play as the three roughly forty-minute sections are set backstage as Jobs who has been invested with equal parts hubris and focus by Michael Fassbender prepares to launch three of his major products The Macintosh in 1984 the NeXT ""Cube"" in 1988 and the iMac in 1998. The same subsidiary characters swirl in and out Jobs feisty and invaluable marketing executive Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet) tech genius and early partner Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen) Mac software designer Andy Herzfeld (Michael Stuhlbarg) Apple chief executive John Sculley (Jeff Daniels) perennially shunned ex-girlfriend Chrisann Brennan (Katherine Waterston) and the latters daughter with Jobs Lisa (Makenzie Moss then Perla Haney-Jardine). The actors are uniformly superb. Read more Kristen Stewart and Nicholas Hoult in Equals Venice Review The dramatic dynamic linking all these characters is that everyone wants something from the young Zeus of their world that they cannot get. The specifics differ in each case but they all boil down to the desire for acknowledgment of their value from a difficult and withholding man one famous for abusing his underlings keeping them guessing about where they stand and rejecting their ideas only to later claim them as his own. As with Kirk Douglas ambitious movie producer in The Bad and the Beautiful in another era the boss treats even those closest to him very badly but in the end his intimates and associates so desperately crave his approval that they keep coming back for more. Read more Carey Mulligan and Meryl Streep in Suffragette Telluride Review Following a disarming black-and-white clip of Arthur C. Clarke in 1974 accurately extolling a future in which computers will ""enrich our society"" and be as commonplace as telephones Boyle and Sorkin jump ahead just ten years and plunge right into the mad moments before Jobs is to take the stage in Cupertino to introduce the Mac to a panting public which has already had its appetite whetted by Ridley Scotts brilliant 1984 Super Bowl commercial. Jobs (who was just 29 at the time) was never anything other than cool and composed before the public but conditions backstage could not be more chaotic Jobs insists to his frazzled tech wizard Hertzfeld that the Mac itself must say ""hello"" to the crowd and demands that the exit signs be (illegally) turned off Woz badgers him to publicly acknowledge the old Apple II team and Chrisann picks this moment to show up with little Lisa and give him hell for not acknowledging his daughter and providing for them. Read more Johnny Depp in Black Mass Venice Review To a man who insists that the days event is equal in importance to the winning of World War II and repeatedly compares himself to God the entreaties of his underlings seem like so much begging. It must be accepted by everyone in his sphere that Jobs operates on an immeasurably higher level than they do and that his will must be done. Although he can however infrequently bend and compromise people mostly go along for fear of being cast out of his orbit altogether. While the presence of Jobs ex and child at a moment like this seems pretty unrealistic even forced Sorkins dramatic strategy becomes clear Hes using a compressed moment of career intensity to spotlight diverse elements of his subjects nature--overweening ambition massive self-confidence ultra-demanding posture lack of compassion and overriding egomania--for the purposes of illuminating his genius as well as his paranoia about others. ""Im like Julius Caesar"" he insists to Sculley. ""Im surrounded by enemies."" Read more Jake Gyllenhaal in Everest Venice Review As he has repeatedly shown in the past Sorkin has a gift for writing the elevated gab of brainiacs which has made him an ideal chronicler of such modern-age titans as Mark Zuckerberg and now Jobs. That said The Social Network and Steve Jobs are radically different in their approaches to drama and character. But whereas David Finchers direction of the former provided an incisive and often quite funny sense of cool to the former Boyles fast-heartbeat pacing and quasi-verite style provides the new film with a constant dramatic hum and you-are-there immediacy. Four years later Jobs suspicions have been confirmed by his exile from Apple. The grand old San Francisco Opera House is the setting for the next presentation of the gorgeously geometric but universally undesired NeXT computer. Indeed the portent of failure looms over this attempt at reinvention like a fog bank rolling in over San Francisco and years of mounting conflict come to a head as Jobs and Apple separately hit bottom. By 1998 however Jobs is back in charge overseeing the launch of the iMac. Although Woz persists in goading his old friend about how the Apple II is still the only successful Apple product Joanna (the only person in this telling who can sort of stand up to Jobs) assures him that this time ""Youre gonna win."" After the downer dynamics of the second act Boyle whips up a real sense of enormous expectations in the home stretch a feeling that the revolution has arrived due to one mans unswerving foresight drive and perfectionism. Jobs may have treated many people badly and never built anything himself but what mattered was his vision and refusal to be deterred. Its a description that fits many if not most great and influential figures in history and it certainly does here. Still Steve Jobs might have been a too remote too documentary-like film if it werent for the element of his daughter Lisa. This part of Jobs story is painful in human terms with the child of one of the nations richest men obliged to live along with her mother on a pittance in squalid surroundings; getting anything out of him be it love or money provokes legitimate comparisons to Scrooge. But as Lisa grows older there is a bit of understanding on her part and a degree of grudging generosity from him providing the film with its bit of heart. Propulsively fast fleet and inquisitive the film is at the same time somewhat less flashy than most of Boyles most famous and successful works including Trainspotting Slumdog Millionaire and 127 Hours. Due to its ""backstage"" setting and approximate real-time frame Jobs cant help but provoke memories of the recent Birdman which breathtakingly covered continuous action with unprecedented fluidity. Boyles sophisticated but pragmatic visual approach to evoking a maelstrom of activity stands somewhere between that and more conventional cinema-verite befitting perhaps the period in which its set. But hardly any of this would matter without a dynamic actor at the center of things nailing the part of Jobs and while Fassbender doesnt closely physically resemble the man he fully delivers the essentials of how we have come to perceive the man Along with intellectual brilliance and force of personality the actor also taps into the mans frequently unreachability power to inspire unswerving faith in his own instincts attention to the smallest detail utter lack of sentimentality and the certitude that can come from occupying a different loftier realm. Most of all you get the strong sense from Fassbender of a mind that is always several steps beyond everyone elses one that allows him to shift gears without taking a breath. The three women in Jobs life portrayed here get just enough screen time for the actresses playing them -- Winslet Waterston and Haney-Jardine as the adolescent Lisa -- to bust out with long-supressed emotion. Albeit with great difficulty they at least get the man to bend slightly which is more than his male associate can say. Works about Jobs have become something of an industry in the four years since his death. There have already been two number-one best-selling biographies by Walter Isaacson in 2011 and the current Becoming Steve Jobs by Brent Schlender and Rick Tetzeli. This is the second posthumous dramatic film after Joshua Michael Sterns lackluster Jobs in 2013 with Ashton Kutcher in the title role (there was also the 1997 cult favorite TV film Pirates of Silicon Valley). Documentaries are proliferating from Steve Jobs One Last Thing in 2011 to the indefatigable Alex Gibneys current Steve Jobs The Man in the Machine. And in 2017 there will be an opera. There may never be the last word.

For those who subscribe to the generally held view that the late co-founder of Apple was both an iconic visionary and a monster with a silicon chip where his heart should be rest assured that writer Aaron Sorkin director Danny Boyle and star Michael Fassbender have given their subject the brilliant maddening ingeniously designed and monstrously self-aggrandizing movie he deserves. Blowing away traditional storytelling conventions with the same withering contempt that seems to motivate its characters every interaction ""Steve Jobs"" is a bravura backstage farce a wildly creative fantasia in three acts in which every scene plays out as a real-time volley of insults and ideas -- insisting with sometimes gratingly repetitive sound and fury that Jobs gift for innovation was perhaps inextricable from his capacity for cruelty. Straining like mad to be the ""Citizen Kane"" (or at least the ""Birdman"") of larger-than-life techno-prophet biopics this is a film of brash swaggering artifice and monumental ego a terrific actors showcase and an incorrigibly entertaining ride that looks set to be one of the falls early must-see attractions. Despite the cinematic cottage industry that has recently sprung up around Jobs legacy (including Alex Gibneys fine documentary ""Steve Jobs The Man in the Machine"") Universal should have little trouble establishing its Oct. 9 release as the only Steve Jobs movie the broader public will really need or want to see; to even compare it to ""Jobs"" the Ashton Kutcher-starring indie mediocrity that came and went in 2013 would be as unfair as likening the Star Child to one of those apes wandering around at the beginning of ""2001."" Indeed its a measure of the films chutzpah that ""Steve Jobs"" at times seems to be channeling Kubricks science-fiction touchstone (which is duly mentioned here) by developing its own sophisticated multi-part structure -- one where every new chapter marks a major evolutionary leap forward and where Jobs himself is the cold towering obelisk dictating humanitys steady onward march toward technological supremacy. Inspired in the loosest possible sense of the word by Walter Isaacsons massive and authoritative Jobs biography Sorkins screenplay has mastered the art of conveying a characters essence -- not by delivering the most comprehensive account possible (Pixar Xerox and cancer are just a few topics that go unmentioned) but by compressing the most relevant data into one significant time frame. Or rather three significant time frames each one centered around the public launch of a Jobs-created product that would change the course of his career and thus the course of global technology. Its a most appropriate conceit for a man who by most unflattering accounts lavished more love and care on his signature creations than on any of the people in his inner circle. At the same time the pictures surreal backstage-farce approach ensures that those people are very much in Jobs face mere minutes before showtime always choosing the worst possible moment to take him to task. Act one is set in 1984 at De Anza Community College in Cupertino Calif. where Jobs (Fassbender not quite looking 29) is about to unveil the first-ever Macintosh for which a recent Super Bowl ad has stoked massive anticipation. Everyone is in crisis mode System-software developer Andy Hertzfeld (Michael Stuhlbarg) is desperately trying to get the computer to say ""hello"" to the audience something Jobs insists on with typical stubbornness. Hes already fuming because hes lost the Time magazine cover he was promised possibly due to the recently aired scandal involving his ex-girlfriend Chrisann Brennan (Katherine Waterston ""Inherent Vice"") and her 5-year-old daughter Lisa (Makenzie Moss) whose paternity he has publicly denied. Making matters worse Chrisann herself shows up with Lisa in tow and demands money asking him how it feels to be worth 441 million while the mother of his child is on welfare. If Jobs is the master of this three-ring circus then his long-suffering mediator is Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet) his most trusted friend and consort who tries to manage his moods and demands over the course of the film while urging him to treat those around him fairly. Certainly few deserve such consideration more than Steve ""Woz"" Wozniak (Seth Rogen exceptional) the friendly long-suffering Apple co-founder and programming genius who knows he deserves more credit for their success than his partner has given him over the years (the film includes a few judicious flashbacks to the two men building their future empire in Jobs garage). But such consideration is not forthcoming from Jobs who rebuffs Wozs request that he publicly acknowledge the team behind the Apple II computer -- still the companys biggest moneymaker and one for which Jobs doesnt bother to hide his dislike. In this first act alone Sorkins script establishes core aspects of Jobs personal and professional identities that will be further advanced and imaginatively embellished in the next two segments. We witness firsthand his impossible perfectionism and refusal to take no for an answer; his withering criticism of his colleagues and employees all in the name of eliciting their very best work; his ridiculously high opinion of himself complete with self-flattering comparisons to Stravinsky and Caesar; his insistence that his computers reflect his exquisite design sense and remain incompatible with non-Apple products; his ongoing hang-ups about his adoption as a child and what it says about his inability to control his destiny; and above all his startling callousness toward his own child who begins to interest him only when she shows flashes of her fathers brainpower. Things have shifted considerably when act two picks up in 1988 The Macintosh has tanked Jobs has been fired from Apple and hes now preparing to stage a comeback via his new company NeXT which is about to release a computer model notable for its ""black cube"" design and impractical 6500 retail price. The setting is the San Francisco Opera House and Daniel Pembertons music adroitly shifts from percussive beats to classical orchestrations -- all the better to underscore Jobs sense of himself as not a lowly musician but a master conductor. Even now kicked out of his empire he seems to be firmly in control of each situation as he goes another few rounds with Woz discusses the uncertain future of both NeXT and Apple with Joanna and grudgingly spends time with the now 9-year-old Lisa (Ripley Sobo) whos clearly warmed to the dad who once disowned her. But Jobs chief sparring partner this time around is John Sculley (Jeff Daniels) the Apple CEO who fired him three years earlier under mysterious circumstances that are revisited here in a boardroom flashback. As editor Elliot Graham cuts swiftly between past and present overlapping Sorkins already rapid-fire dialogue the formal showmanship dazzles even if the corporate backbiting isnt especially easy to follow. But with Sculley on his way out at Apple which has foundered in Jobs absence the latter seems all the more triumphant in his conviction that personal vision will always prevail over groupthink ""Artists lead"" he snarls ""and hacks ask for a show of hands."" By act three set in 1998 at San Franciscos Davies Symphony Hall the now 43-year-old Jobs has been restored to his full glory at Apple where hes about to launch the iMac to unprecedented anticipation; the Internet is about to explode and the iPod is just three years away. Even now sporting the graying hair glasses and black turtleneck that will constitute his signature look in years to come hes as obstinate and nasty as ever finding yet another reason to quarrel with the now 19-year-old Lisa (Perla Haney-Jardine) to the ongoing chagrin of both Joanna and Hertzfeld. And he has one more harsh confrontation with Woz in which Jobs once again digs in his heels and refuses to admit any wrongdoing prompting his old frenemy to declare his own philosophy of life ""You can be decent and gifted at the same time."" Its here however that after roughly two hours of nonstop bitchery and antagonism Sorkin and Fassbender allow the faintest flicker of compassion to emerge; were left pondering that this ruthless conqueror may have been capable of love after all albeit a love that he was willing to define only on his deeply distorted terms. Indeed all but Jobs most violent detractors may take issue with a picture that can be read on one level as a form of high-end character assassination and on another as a live-action cartoon. Sorkins warts-and-all approach is so thorough that it seems to discover warts on top of warts; youd have to go back to ""There Will Be Blood"" to find another Hollywood antihero so willing to isolate himself from others and to pursue his dreams with such vicious single-mindedness. This isnt of course the first time Sorkin has turned an unflattering eye on a tech-world revolutionary and those viewers who thought ""The Social Network"" was a bit too show-offy will find this even more brazenly written picture truly insufferable by comparison. The virtues of Sorkins style are as self-evident as the vices; his work here is by turns ferociously inventive and cloddishly on-the-nose -- a high-wire achievement thats easy to admire even when its nearly impossible to like. And something similar could surely be said of Steve Jobs himself whose profound disinterest in soliciting anyones affection is what ultimately lends Boyle and Sorkins film its underlying integrity despite the outrageous factual dramatic and aesthetic liberties theyve taken with the material. In this unabashedly fictionalized context Fassbender overcomes the obvious casting hurdle (he looks nothing like Jobs whose Arab-American lineage is briefly referenced) and delivers a performance as enthralling and fully sustained as any on his estimable resume. That the actor is onscreen at every minute makes it all the better that its impossible to take your eyes off him or your ears This is an actor who knows exactly how to toss off Sorkins dialogue emphasizing rhythm and inflection over volume while embodying confidence and authority in his every atom. Its a performance that sets the tone for equally fine work all around Rogen delivers a lovable downright huggable spin on Wozniak; Stuhlbarg mines layers of wry wisdom from Hertzfeld; and as Jobs right-hand woman Winslet overcomes a wobbly Polish accent to provide the audience with an essential lifeline to reason and sanity. Working with d.p. Alwin Kutchler Boyle sometimes sends the camera hurtling after the characters in lengthy down-the-corridor tracking shots; elsewhere the brief transitional snippets between acts feature some fairly aggressive stylization in line with his usual m.o. But for the most part this is the filmmakers most reined-in picture in some time as if a too-kinetic approach would interfere with the verbal energy of Sorkins script. Besides Guy Hendrix Dyas unobtrusively excellent production design the pictures major visual coup is the decision to shoot the three acts on three different formats grainy 16mm film for 1984 lustrous 35mm for 1988 and sleek high-definition digital for 1998. The distinctions may well be lost on the vast majority of viewers but its just the sort of nicely understated aesthetic flourish that Steve Jobs himself would have surely appreciated.

While the guy could certainly sell like a carnival huckster he had no more vision than anybody else of that age. Last I heard the pope stopped the beatification a while back. Why hasnt the media caught up with that yet? This is getting old fast. Reply IT 2 IT says September 7 2015 at 437 am DONE to DEATH --BLLLEH-- Reply 66muds99 says October 2 2015 at 425 pm Beauty and the Beast was far more done to death when Disney released the animated movie in the 1990s. Its considered one of the best cartoons of all time even though even the theme song lyrics say it all ""Tale as old as time"". If its an interesting movie its an interesting movie. Reply Bill C says September 7 2015 at 1247 am So the job which made him rich the job which brought him back from the dead the job in which he mastered the art of hiring well and letting people do their jobs will be entirely ignored so that once again the story of Jobs as one dimensional narcissistic bully can be reinforced. This - is why I think Sorkin is a hack. His Social Network script painted Zuckerburg as a carton as well. None of his scripts are able to show these men as nuanced full fledged individuals. That would be maddening for a fictional character but it is a far worse sin when you have a real person that is being depicted. Jobs had his flaws. But considering he took two very different tacks at two powerhouse companies shows that he was a far better businessman than Sorkin will ever be a writer. Reply me says September 25 2015 at 537 pm Or you could wait until you actually see the movie before judging it. P.S. I bought some milk today; it was in a ""carton"" as well. Reply Nick says September 6 2015 at 806 pm So Boyle and Sorkin made the movie that I expected it shows the evil and human side of Steve Jobs as everybody who knows him is aware of (nothing new) and in the end it sends the message that he is some kind of God that needs to be remembered forever. Typical of Hollywood not interested in another biography that wants to make a jerk becomes this huge hero. Ill pass. Reply Ivan el Terrible says September 7 2015 at 434 am Just another Oscar-bait crap made by ass-kissers like Sorkin and Boyle. Jobs deserves to be dead. Reply Mike says September 6 2015 at 134 pm Mr. Chang the film is ""masterful"" and ""brilliant"" but it gets from you only 90/100 on Metacritic ? I dont understand this. Mistake ? Reply Guest says September 6 2015 at 921 pm Thats still a great score. Why are you nitpicking? Reply Bill B. says September 6 2015 at 1043 am Can Not Wait Reply Alley says September 6 2015 at 824 am I have a Mac an Iphone an Ipad. Thats all I need to know about Jobs. After reading Isaacsons authorized bio I feel no need to spend any time in the presence of Steve Jobs. Reply me says September 25 2015 at 539 pm But you do have time to spend telling us about it? Not sure why. Reply Skip Press (skippress) says September 6 2015 at 743 am The unavoidable truth of life is that people who bring great changes are often jerks which all the chronicles of his life tell us Jobs was more often than not. I use a Mac have an iPhone and I appreciate the technological innovations but as living lives go I have to say ""Better luck next time Steve."" I read Isaacsons book; great job so Im not going to see this movie no matter how well Hollywood has once again beautified anger. Reply laguna_greg says October 5 2015 at 1016 am Sorry to disappoint but Jobs invented nothing and created nothing. He himself did not bring about the ""great change"" you suggest. Dumping a bazillion dollars into the marketing budget is deep pockets not rocket science. This film and the other hagiographies are only a passing interest in a man who had a momentary impact on the world of his time. And it will soon be over. Reply Bill says September 6 2015 at 640 am Thanks for the review; as I consider Jobs a genius and whose loss computing and society in general many never quite recover from Ill definitely stay away. Reply iamtrue2bill says September 6 2015 at 531 am This sounds like an excellent film. I love Sorkins writing Boyles directing and Fassbenders acting so Im on board Reply Marc Weiss says September 6 2015 at 524 am Correction you mean the iPod was 3 years away in 1998 not the iPhone which was unveiled in 2007. Reply Fer Realz says September 6 2015 at 1109 am Thank you yes I noticed that error too.

Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin whos written about Americas Great Flawed Men with such fire and hyperarticulate pathos that hes threatened to become one himself outdoes his work on The Social Network with an even sharper and more savage script about a tech visionary whose genius threatens to corrupt his ethics. Meanwhile Slumdog Millionaire director Danny Boyle--at turns an agreeably rambunctious and disastrously literal choice for this material--does his best to stay out of sight but whenever he shows his hand you want to smack it away. Combining the entrepreneurial narcissism of Slumdog Millionaire with the backstage mania of Birdman Steve Jobs squeezes the Apple founders outsized persona into three discrete story sections each one corresponding to a product launch vibrating with the same make-or-break electricity of a Broadway show on opening night. Michael Fassbender whose lightning-in-a-bottle performance has distilled the CEO into a nasal whine and a merciless attention to detail sinks deeper into the role as Jobs develops into the icon he would ultimately become. The first and most flawlessly scripted slice is set in January of 1984 during the half hour before the unveiling of the initial Macintosh. Fassbender like a coiled snake whose tail never stops rattling is too ripped to feel fully persuasive as a burgeoning geek tyrant during this early stretch but his single-mindedness grows more convincing with every furious line of dialogue. During the 30 minutes he spends obsessively trying to get his prototype to say ""Hello"" during the keynote speech Jobs disavows being the father of his daughter humiliates her mother (Katherine Waterston) and lights the verbal matches that will eventually burn down the bridges connecting him to his boss (Jeff Daniels) his colleague (Michael Stuhlbarg) and his brainiac best friend Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen). Perhaps his most rewarding confrontations are those with Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet steady and brilliant) the marketing manager who effectively doubles as his conscience. The second section jumps to 1988 as an Apple-ousted Jobs launches his doomed NeXT computer while the third and final act leaps a decade down the road for the debut of the iMac the first smash of Apples subsequent series of unprecedented corporate achievements. At one point Jobs likens himself to a composer by declaring that he ""conducts the orchestra"" and the metaphor feels increasingly apt as the films thirds begin to echo each other like rounds of a canon. All of the people closest to Jobs show up for a status report every time hes preparing to take the stage each of them presenting their own unique challenge to his pathological desire for ""end-to-end control"" over his operating systems. (If only personal and professional relationships functioned the same way.) By the time the film gets to 1998 Fassbender has not only become the spitting image of the person hes playing (the short hair and frameless glasses go a long way) hes also made him distinct from his legacy sprinting along the pencil-thin line between the genius the world got to know and the sociopath we would hear about in whispers. Alas even Fassbenders miraculous performance cant save director Boyle from himself After nearly two hours of keeping his worst impulses at bay (prepare to roll your eyes as the image stutters like a computer screen about to freeze) Boyles shoot-for-the-moon instincts seize on the one maudlin note of Sorkins script and drive home the final minutes with a wallop of well-meaning schmaltz that reeks of candied bullshit. Boyles decent nature is diametrically opposed to that of his subject. Whats left in the rubble may not be perfect but its human and thats okay.

If Jobs was alive today I think he would be quite enthralled with Fassbinders nuanced and articulate performance. I also thought that Kate Winslet and Seth Rogan did brilliant work with their characters although Rogan always seems to be himself with a slight derivation in character with every performance. Jeff Daniels was also good and basically believable in his role. I think that screenwriter Aaron Sorkin did an admirable job at developing the storyline and representing the quirky characters particularly Steve Jobs. The real Jobs was part genius part psychopath part insensitive and selfish part egomaniacal and part human.This movie showed the viewer all these different parts yet instilled in us all that Steve Jobs may have had some serious flaws in his behavioral eccentricities but was still a very special and well loved respected and iconic master innovator for this century.

To their credit with ""Steve Jobs"" director Danny Boyle and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin dont even try. Instead this storytelling power duo who share a penchant for fast-paced developments and vibrant characters stick Jobs in a room and explore his jittery personality from every angle. A kind of ""Birdman"" for the tech sector ""Steve Jobs"" follows its subject around backstage environments in the frenetic moments leading up to a series of highly publicized presentations. While at times too over-the-top and operatic for its own good those same flawed ingredients echo the rough edges that define the movies iconic subject. Rejecting his daughter and alienating his staff the Jobs of ""Steve Jobs"" rarely comes across as likable but he never seems dishonest about his ruthless temperament. ""We dont have to be polite or realistic"" says Jobs (Michael Fassbender) in an early scene parading around with his frantic marketing director Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet) prior to a 1984 speech. Its here that we find Jobs preparing to unveil the first Macintosh computer weeks after the famed advertisement that positioned the personal computer as the antidote to an Orwellian future. Intent on making the computer speak during his talk Jobs ignores the insistence of his technical director Andy Hertzfeld (Michael Stuhlbarg) that the computer has crashed and forces the blustering underling to find a last-minute solution. Far from a technical mastermind Jobs comes across as a master of getting others to do what he wants. That showdown marks the first of several whirlwind exchanges that form the crux of the movies three key sequences. Following the 1984 chapter ""Steve Jobs"" shifts to two more high-speed sequences set at crucial moments in Jobs career his 1988 launching of the NeXTcube an ill-advised project Jobs assembled after Apples board booted him from the company and his triumphant 1998 return when he shepherded along the first edition of the iMac. READ MORE 2015 Telluride Film Festival Reviews Throughout these chapters ""Steve Jobs"" zips along at an exciting clip.  Alwin H. Kuchlers roaming camerawork melds nicely with Daniel Pembertons elaborate score but Fassbenders vivacious performance provides a critical anchor. Each time around similar faces come and go from Jobs estranged daughter Lisa (for whom he named his first computer model or maybe it was the other way around) and his struggling ex-girlfriend (a shrill but believable Katherine Waterson) to Jobs on-and-off pal Steve ""Woz"" Wozniak (Seth Rogen perfectly cast) who continually demands Jobs give more credit to the early Apple team in his presentations. As former Apple CEO John Sculley Jeff Daniels repeatedly surfaces to review the characters own role in Jobs increasingly monolithic career. With the exception of Daniels who does his best in the limited role of a gruff businessman (""the man who fired Steve Jobs"" in Sculleys own words) the cast vanishes into their parts. Buried under makeup and a distinctive Polish accent Winslets chameleonesque transformation is bested only by Fassbender whose vivid expressions and constant movement turn him into a physical marvel. As Woz Rogen could have easily devolved into the archetype of a bearded sidekick; instead hes a profoundly empathetic character passionate about cracking Jobs cold exterior. The biggest transformation in ""Jobs"" however involves its director. Boyle who took on the project following David Finchers departure drops his usual whirlwind editing style and instead develops an engrossing chamber piece. Its the rare Boyle production that doesnt so much burrow inside its characters mind as it explores the chaos he conjures up around him. Still as Boyle and Sorkin both treasure the value of forward momentum the pace of ""Steve Jobs"" is its true star. While the story covers 14 years it never takes a breather. But ""Steve Jobs"" barrels forward with intent rather than the pressure to cover every bullet point those familiar with Apple history might expect to find. Anyone seeking a comprehensive overview of Jobs explosive career must look elsewhere (more specifically Alex Gibneys sprawling documentary ""Steve Jobs The Man in the Machine""; forget about the ill-advised 2013 Ashton Kutcher vehicle ""jOBS""). While Sorkin draws from Walter Isaacsons 2011 biography which tracks Jobs from his tragic childhood to his final days the movie concludes nearly a decade before the iPhone age. It includes none of the lawsuits surrounding his dubious involvement in backdating stock options and colluding with other corporations about their hiring prices. Theres never any mention of the cancer that he spend months hiding from investors. Thats the Steve Jobs saga; Boyle and Sorkin only want the person. Instead ""Steve Jobs"" provides a methodical overview of the innovators claustrophobic state dropping tidbits about his troubled psychology along the way. Hes so preoccupied with work that he seems physically trapped by it always on the verge of the next big thing never absorbing a victory and incapable of comprehending life beyond his immediate obsessions. But it keeps barging in anyway. Its here that ""Steve Jobs"" excels In conflicting dialogue with his former love and the child to whom he initially denies support -- most effectively portrayed at age 19 by newcomer Perla Haney-Jardine -- Jobs finds he cant outmaneuver the people who know him best. Thats especially true for his frustrated offspring seemingly the only person able to confront Jobs without any kind of baggage he can use against her. Meanwhile visits from Sculley and Woz yield snippets of their own rocky history with Jobs with jagged flashbacks that mark the only moments when the movie ventures beyond indoor arenas. These scenes while snazzily woven into the story nevertheless suffer from the feeling of piling on to an already busy set of events and simply echoing events already described. Of course Sorkin screenplays rarely go hand in hand with nuance a tendency that reaches maddening extremes in ""Steve Jobs."" For similar reasons the movie displays the limits of Sorkins rapid-fire dialogue as much as its virtues. Theres plenty of amusing banter (to Wozs insistence that ""computers arent paintings"" Jobs routinely offers a resounding ""fuck you""). But constant overstatement distracts from the speedy drama at hand (""God sent his only son on a suicide mission but we like him anyway because he made trees"" Jobs exclaims at one point and you can practically hear Sorkin chuckling at his cleverness in the background). Worse the movie includes the occasional winking hint at Apples future including one unnecessary moment when Jobs boasts of plans to ""put music in your pocket."" Yet structurally Sorkin has delivered a masterwork of narrative economy. Never once showing Jobs actually delivering his speeches ""Steve Jobs"" instead demystifies those famed performances to find Jobs in his natural state -- that is keen on manipulating everyone around him and furious when the pieces dont fit. The only reality he knows involves his domination. In an opening segment Boyle shows us a newsreel clip of Arthur C. Clarke discussing a primordial computer and envisioning a future where one can find ""all the information you need in a compact form."" Though it carries several connotations the prologue sets the stage for the way Jobs capitalized on futuristic ideals to obtain his own goals a strategy that came at the expense of getting along with others. Thats why whenever a few characters do manage to break through his mental armor -- with the abrupt hug from his daughter for example or the unexpectedly warmhearted remark from Woz -- ""Steve Jobs"" finds a satisfying emotional beat. With the closing shot Boyle shifts focus from Jobs to one of the people most affected by his legacy shrewdly suggesting that the man who thought he could master the world instead created one beyond his control. Grade B+ ""Steve Jobs"" premiered this weekend at the Telluride Film Festival. It opens nationwide on October 9.

The whole purpose of a piece of propaganda like this is to make everyone believe like you do- that he was ""a real prick"" (he wasnt he was quite a nice guy I met him on several occasions including having the opportunity to see him when he was pissed off.) He was very likable which is why he has scores and scores of fans and why hacks like Sorkin want to take him down... which ultimately is part of their leftist anti-capitalists agenda. Steve Jobs made high end computing power available to EVERYONE and democratized what previously was only available to the wealthy and highly government controlled. Lack of government control goes against sorkin and other leftists agendas and so of course they demonize the one who did it. (They also demonized Bill Gates in the past but he hired PR. Jobs let his work speak for him but alas most rubes are not smart enough to put two and two together.) Just from the trailer of this movie you know its a hit piece- the claim that the GUI was stolen is a lie the claim that Jobs was not an engineer was a lie (he worked on both hardware and software but recognized that Woz was a genius while he was not.) The claim that he never acknowledged Lisa or refused to after it became clear she was his daughter is also a lie. The movie makes it look like he waited decades which is a lie. Its sad that one of the great men of our generation has to be taken down but this serves the agenda of demonizing achievement in favor of central control. The review should be criticized for not calling the movie out on these fallacies. Reply Toni Chapman May 12 2016 601 pm I saw this movie about two weeks ago at a screening and was bored to tears.Nothing new here. Everyone knows this man was a real prick and really not very likable.Yes a real innovator and driven to be the best at putting together an idea and making his vision come to life other wise I would not have given him the time of day. Why would you make a movie about such an unlikable person who was nothing more that an great idea man and pitch man? Reply Eric Kohn May 12 2016 601 pm Always nice to hear from our friendly readers. I hope they take some time to check out the many many other films from around the world that weve reviewed these past few weeks.
