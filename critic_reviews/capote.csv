Attila Dory/Sony Pictures Classics hide caption toggle caption Attila Dory/Sony Pictures Classics The film follows Capote as he writes his breakthrough work of novelized nonfiction In Cold Blood. Attila Dory/Sony Pictures Classics Truman Capote -- the 1960s writer and celebrity -- is the subject of the new movie Capote. The star is Philip Seymour Hoffman who combines an amazing bit of impersonation with a first-class acting performance. Oscar anyone? (Soundbite of ""Capote"") Mr. PHILIP SEYMOUR HOFFMAN (As Truman Capote) Yeah I have decided on a title for my book. I think youll like it; its very masculine. Its ""In Cold Blood."" Isnt that good? DEBBIE ELLIOTT host Truman Capote the 1960s writer celebrity and some say genius is the subject of the new movie ""Capote."" Nearly everyone who reviews the movie says its star Philip Seymour Hoffman deserves an Oscar nomination. Our critic Bob Mondello is in that number. BOB MONDELLO reporting It was a brief newspaper story that caught Truman Capotes eye in 1959 a terrible inexplicable murder in a farmhouse; a whole family dead. He thought it might make a good New Yorker magazine piece. So he headed for Kansas where his bizarre affectations coupled with a sleek long camel-haired coat made him seem an almost alien creature. But director Bennett Miller establishes that Capotes weirdness may have worked in his favor allowing him with a little help from his novelist friend Harper Lee to ingratiate himself with say the local sheriffs wife. (Soundbite of ""Capote"") Mr. HOFFMAN (As Capote) Girdle up no extra bulges. If youre dressed right when he gets home the rest of the evening should be smooth sailing. Bon voyage gals. Unidentified Woman I cant believe you got that whole page. I only read it once. Mr. HOFFMAN (As Capote) I had to ...(unintelligible) myself. I have 94 percent recall. Unidentified Person ...94 percent recall. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. HOFFMAN (As Capote) Cut that out. Unidentified Person Cut that out. Mr. HOFFMAN (As Capote) Cut that... (Soundbite of laughter) MONDELLO The sheriffs wife then the sheriff then Capote got access to the two men accused of the murders and developed a rapport with one of them Perry Smith who after many months of interviews started to think of him as a friend especially after he helped them find a new lawyer. (Soundbite of ""Capote"") Mr. CLIFTON COLLINS Jr. (As Perry Smith) Thank you. Mr. HOFFMAN (As Capote) Well its as much for me as for anyone and I couldnt bear the thought of losing you so soon. Mr. COLLINS (As Smith) Were going to be able to use your book for our case. Youll write we never got to raise an insanity plea. You wrote how terrible the lawyers was. Mr. HOFFMAN (As Capote) Well I havent written a word yet. Mr. COLLINS (As Smith) What have you been doing? Mr. HOFFMAN (As Capote) Research talking to you. MONDELLO But the inmates refuse to talk about the night of the murders and without that Capote didnt really have a book a book he thought might change the way writers write but that was meanwhile putting him on increasingly shaky ethical ground. As the case dragged on for years he courted a nervous breakdown and was alternately seductive and cruelly manipulative with his subjects. (Soundbite of ""Capote"") Mr. COLLINS (As Smith) They only exacerbate the problem. They only heighten or intensify it. Maybe we can prepare a requiem... Mr. HOFFMAN (As Capote) Perry I know what exacerbate means. Mr. COLLINS (As Smith) OK. Well... Mr. HOFFMAN (As Capote) There is not a word or a sentence or a concept that you can illuminate for me. There is one singular reason I keep coming here. Mr. COLLINS (As Smith) Truman... Mr. HOFFMAN (As Capote) November 14th 1959 three years ago. Three years. Mm-hmm. And thats all I want to hear from you. MONDELLO Actor Philip Seymour Hoffman lets you see exactly how this might have worked how Capote disarmed people into underestimating him and then went in for the kill. Its a marvelous performance one that wrests every disturbing nuance from Dan Futtermans script and still leaves room for others to register Clifton Collins Jr. scarily needy as Perry Smith; Catherine Keener reserved and conflicted as Harper Lee. Still its Hoffman who dazzles. Whether delicately slipping a bribe to a prison warden or crying for a man hes just doomed his Capote is haunting. Im Bob Mondello.

Accordingly the darling of the Manhattan cocktail set embarks on an ambitious project which would as he hoped change the way writers wrote the non-fiction novel a form of extended reportage which presented the stuff of life with the colour and emotion of fantasy. The material Capote chose was the murder in rural Kansas of the Clutter family by drifters Perry Smith and Richard Hickock ( Clifton Collins Jr and Mark Pellegrino ); the resulting book In Cold Blood was his greatest and last completed achievement. Its authorial voice scrupulously avoids overt opinionating but the triumph of director Miller writer Dan Futterman and particularly Hoffman - who gives one of the best performances of the decade - is to suggest that the case is most fruitfully read in the context of Capotes own life and as an ultimately self-damning exercise of ego.The movies early stages come across as a fish-out-of-water comedy - an odd fish and dark comedy located in a buttoned-up small town more accustomed to the whisper of wind voices in the wind-bent wheat than the nasal whine and twitchily pursed lips of Hoffmans fruitily spot-on Gothamite. We chuckle as he wins over the rubes - notably lead investigator Alvin Dewey ( Chris Cooper ) - with celebrity anecdotes and his own childhood recollections; then realise the canny calculation behind the bartering of his autobiographical stories for gobbets of information which he hoards and savours with vampiric relish. On first spotting the killings in the paper he sets about with scissors as if a tailor with shears shaping his material to his ends; by the time he meets and courts the killers the attribution of cold-bloodedness is more than a little murky. Truman and Perrys relationship is something like love -intimate attentive even co-dependent - but clouded by using; at one point the writer spoon-feeds the killer baby food at another calls him as a goldmine.Capotes obscene selfishness edges into literal gallows humour desperate for the executions that will allow him to finish his book he sincerely describes his own experience as harrowing; awaiting yet another appeal decision he sighs Ill pray it goes my way - which is to say not Smith and Hickocks. Yet Hoffman retains our sympathy through unlikability. It took barely six weeks to catch the pair and six years for them to hang during which time Nelle Harper Lee ( Catherine Keener ) - Capotes childhood friend research assistant and at least here would-be conscience - saw To Kill A Mockingbird written published garlanded and filmed; even as you marvel at Trumans narcissism its no great struggle to feel his distress see his grip on the ever-present tumbler of booze tighten.The killer irony is that when the consummation Capote has so devoutly wished for finally comes to pass it shatters him. Having rushed to embrace a story of death in the pursuit of glory he finds in the real thing an unspeakable horror yet cannot himself change in response. His verdict on the sight - I will never get over it - is another testament to the egotism that brought him to it.

Orange mans 2nd trial nets life term in killing - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Sentence Orange mans 2nd trial nets life term in killingJuly 10 2009|By Sarah Lundy and Amy L. Edwards Sentinel Staff WritersA judge sentenced a 22-year-old Orange County man to life in prison without parole Thursday in a 2006 fatal shooting during a drug deal gone wrong.Deangelo Conner was convicted last month of first-degree murder armed robbery and two counts of robbery with a firearm.Florida law required Circuit Judge Bob Wattles to sentence Conner to life in prison for the murder conviction.Conner had turned down a 25-year plea offer and took his chances at trial.His first trial ended in a mistrial after jurors were heard discussing the case before it was allowed.Authorities say Conner shot Ricardo Rivera 41 once in the chest July 6 2006.Conner and two others initially set up the meeting as a drug buy but they never intended to pay for anything the prosecution said; the three planned to grab the drugs and run.At one point Conner pulled out a gun and fired at Rivera. Conner told investigators that Rivera was charging toward him and he was merely protecting himself.The jury didnt buy it.Several of Ricardo Riveras relatives attended the sentencing including his children and brother Robert Rivera who read statements from several people.In a statement Ricardo Riveras ex-wife wrote that the hardest thing she has had to do was tell her children they no longer had a father.The woman wrote that her familys hurt will never go away.

"Cold-Blooded Writer washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Cold-Blooded Writer Philip Seymour Hoffman portrays Truman Capote with a masters finesse in director Bennett Millers spare eloquent film about the writers greatest story. (By Attila Dory -- United Artists And Sony Pictures) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday October 21 2005 Truman Capote was as corny as Kansas in November which is to say not corny at all. So what was the elfin mincing vicuna-wrapped dowager-loving gossip-mongering gay E.T.-looking writer doing in a small village in the western edges of the Jayhawk State in November 1959? (He probably didnt even know what a jayhawk was.) The answer is twofold according to Gerald Clarkes great 1988 biography ""Capote"" and this terrific movie based on a substantial part of it writing a great book and destroying himself. That intertwined trajectory of creation and destruction is at the heart of the severe film almost like a diagram of the primal Faustian bargain The artist grows so much and gains so much achieves immortality really -- and it only costs him his soul. Capote a doyen of the salons (but never the saloons) of the Upper East Side and secure in his world and reputation as the New Yorkers best and brightest boy saw an article in the Nov. 15 New York Times recounting the slaughter of a prosperous farm family named Clutter on the high wheat plains by persons unknown. Something provoked his imagination perhaps the hugeness of the crime juxtaposed with the stolidity of the community and its solitude way out there where the rain is Tess the fires Jo and they call the wind Maria. Within days he was headed there in the company of his boyhood chum the soon-to-be-published writer Harper Lee who served as his enabler as he attempted to make contact with the sundered town its law enforcement professionals and ultimately the perpetrators of the deed. In ""Capote"" director Bennett Miller writer Dan Futterman and most of all actor Philip Seymour Hoffman in the title role (all are boyhood friends publicity materials say) capture this process with exquisite accuracy if minimal flourish The genius of the film besides Hoffmans stunning performance is that it knows exactly how much is enough. It never overplays lingers or punches up. It ""writes"" as it were in the cinematic equivalent of the spare eloquent prose the New Yorker is famous for. Miller shrinks each sequence to its salient story point then quits it in a rush. Its almost as if he went through Futtermans screenplay and cut the first half out of every scene. Meanwhile he uses the severe landscape -- flat the horizon a hundred miles out the sky gray and mean the wind making the sound like folks was out there dyin the rustle of the dry corn the frozen patches of snow -- to suggest the inner state of its title antagonists mind. And the filmmakers pull no punches (neither did Clarkes book although Capotes did) Trumans a bitch. With an airy wave of his fat moist fingers he disdains poor square cop Alvin Dewey (played by Chris Cooper as if his first name were Gary) and then acknowledges in a throwaway line as he Joan-Crawfords dramatically through the police station with a sweep of his stylish coat ""Oh I dont really care if you catch them or not."" Not exactly meant to endear himself to stoical law-n-order types. (Miller has great fun contrasting Capotes piping flounce with the doughy so-butch faces of the Kansas lawmen.) But Tru has charm and though you cant see it under the gay bling grit. And hes able to use his outsiderness to reach people from odd angles for example playing up his New Orleans background to captivate Deweys wife a New Orleanian herself. You never heard NAwleansean spoken with such high Tallulahesque zing As he was with the Dowager Swans of the Rich Old Lady set in New York a few years later hes able to ingratiate himself first with her and by extension with the square-shootin Dewey which gives him almost unlimited access to the investigative machinery of the state and in turn the cred to get inside the prison system. Other than Dewey and Catherine Keeners grounded but hardly Alabama-seeming Lee the movie has nothing nice to say about anyone. It views all humanity through Trumans jaundiced eyes including himself. It suggests that not only was the killing done in cold blood but over the following few years so was the writing. ""Capote"" gets at the writers ethical dilemma Real people and their lives are never as tidy as a good story and they must be nudged shoved manipulated to get with the program. Every writer of long-form nonfiction faces this issue; he also needs the cooperation of people his book will be unkind to and so the manipulations are creative as are in his interior life his justifications. Throughout the long writing (close to six years) of ""In Cold Blood"" Capote plays these games with a grandmasters finesse even when they become clouded by emotional engagement possibly even love. He falls for one of the killers a forlorn and embittered loser named Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.). Yet even as he loves the poor wretched thing that Perry is he must use him first to find out what it is that enables a man to put a 12-gauge muzzle to the head of other humans and pull the trigger -- four times -- and second for the killers account of the event which he knew would form the climax of his book and make it great. So he seduces Perry at least metaphorically (the picture avoids the suggestion that some others have made of a physical relationship) and guides him by offering and withholding love by enabling the young mans fantasies of specialness and cruelest of all by denying the nature of the book he is writing even to the point of lying about what the books title will be. He also knows something more terrible His book will be better if Perry swings at the end of the Kansas hangmans rope. He needs that scene. Stories of ambition -- ""Champion"" ""What Makes Sammy Run"" -- usually turn on a sociopathic hero following men without consciences who backslap then backstab (the same backs) their way to the top without a qualm. ""Capote"" revises this formula; the point it makes and almost as a dish of justice served hot is that all this cost Capote everything. He did what he had to do he wrote what he had to write and he was left with fame and fortune -- and plenty of nothing. It ignores theories of alcoholism (the writers clear problem no matter what else may have afflicted him) as disease. Instead it treats alcoholism as a symptom of a deeper soul rot. As a structure the movie also has a weird resemblance to a basketball game. Wha? Well yes in this one sense Remember in the old days of the 76ers before there was a Michael Jordan or a Magic Johnson but there was a Dr. J? Remember Dr. J? The saying was Back away and let him operate and the best thing the Sixers did was cluster in one quadrant of the court making way for the Docs fabulous moves. He won them a championship that way. Thats what they do with Hoffman in this picture. No one fights him for it no one stands against him. Its his picture not merely because Hoffman interceded with the financiers to obtain money not because he exec-produced but because he is the movie. Every one else backs off and lets him do his moves which include a simpering unselfconscious effeminacy a wrist that seems to be filled with helium and a voice that is somewhere between a lisp and a death rattle. Theres also some hypocrisy filtered through this what you might call the movies own corruption of ambition. The filmmakers judge Truman sharply for his use of Perry as a source for the murder scene -- Capote even overemphasized it by pulling it out of chronology and moving it to the rear of the book -- but they do the same. Though the movie isnt a remake of ""In Cold Blood"" (theres already been one) it uses that books structure beginning with the discovery of the bodies on the plain ending with a powerful blast of violence (more violent than Richard Brookss 1967 film) including an image of a twitching Mr. Clutter his throat cut and gushing. Then theres the hanging far more graphic than the original. So they may condemn Tru for his ruthlessness but by using the product of it arent they operating in blood just as cold? Capote (98 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for scenes of violence and brief strong language.

Not ""Capote"" director Bennett Miller and screenwriter Dan Futterman. Along with actor Philip Seymour Hoffman the two have made a generous engrossing movie set during the years famed author Truman Capote was shuttling between New York and Holcomb Kan. The modest farm community had been shaken by the murder of four members of the well-regarded Clutter family. Capotes solemn poetic reporting became his greatest book ""In Cold Blood."" During Capotes first visit to Holcomb we see him experience a couple of awkward encounters with law enforcement. In a gesture at once superior and defensive the flamboyant author of ""Breakfast at Tiffanys"" touches his scarf and says to a cop he thinks is staring too hard ""Bergdorfs."" A few beats later when a lead investigator consents to Capotes covering the police press conference he tips his hat to the author and says ""Sears Roebuck."" So much for any residual snobbery. This is the first sign that ""Capote"" is committed to tender balance and moral intelligence. It is also the first glimmer that Capote a gay man could parlay his discomfort and otherness into an asset. More than a few times he uses his outsider status to ease subjects into opening up. Contrary to its forceful title ""Capote"" isnt a biopic but a portrait of a writer and a cultural moment. Often credited with inventing New Journalism ""In Cold Blood"" was first published in the New Yorker as a serial. A year later it was released in book form. In 1967 director Richard Brooks (""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"") turned the work into a critically acclaimed film. In the late 1950s Capote was searching for a story he could fashion into what he saw as a groundbreaking new genre a nonfiction novel. Upon reading a New York Times article about the slaying of successful farmer Herb Clutter; his wife Bonnie; and two of their children Nancy and Kenyon; Capote called New Yorker editor Wallace Shawn (played here by Bob Balaban). Soon he and childhood friend confidante and fellow author Harper Lee (Catherine Keener) are on a train to Kansas. Initially the killers are unknown. But when ex-con drifters Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.) and Richard ""Dick"" Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) are apprehended in Las Vegas and returned to Kansas Capote finds his drama. After Capote meets Smith (ultimately befriending the killer who would be portrayed in the movie by Robert Blake) he calls Shawn to tell him he has the makings of a great book. Chris Cooper plays Kansas Bureau of Investigation agent Alvin Dewey. Keener does a sharp loving turn as Lee. Dewey and Lee make a necessary and dynamic duo of decency. When Capote first meets Dewey he tells him hes interested in writing the story of a town beset by grief stunned by violence. He doesnt care if the killers are caught. The look the lawman gives the author would be rebuff enough. Keeners Lee is as wise to her friends sensitive soul as she is acutely aware of his narcissism. At a soiree for the movie version of Lees ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" Capote can only talk about how inconvenient the two killers and the appeals process are to his finishing his book. Its not that Capote is indecent but he is an animal of ravenous ambition. In Capote Hoffman lands a character worthy of his gift for portraying the weird social bravado people with broken self-esteem often have. A wonderful talent Hoffman (""Boogie Nights"" and ""Love Liza"") has had his share of overly mannered moments. Here he takes on a man who enjoyed the theatrical turn and dials him down to human - amazingly disquietingly human. Clearly Hoffman and Miller knew that larger-than-life would not fly in a film in which lives had been snuffed out and other lives exploited in the name of Art. Hoffman and company make ""Capote"" well worth seeing. What makes the movie important is the way ""Capote"" exposes the work of journalism. A lot of glorious writing came out of the success of ""In Cold Blood."" But so too did an endless spree of true-crime books. Much like ""In Cold Blood"" this film exposes tensions that continue to dog us to this day.

Starring Philip Seymour Hoffman Catherine Keener and Clifton Collins Jr. Directed by Bennett Miller. (R. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Months in advance the notion of Philip Seymour Hoffman as Truman Capote sounded irresistible but even with that anticipation ""Capote"" is a surprisingly effective and satisfying effort. Hoffmans success in the role goes way beyond the rightness of his casting just as the movies triumph goes well beyond Hoffmans tour de force performance. The film takes a single period in Capotes biography -- the five and a half years during which he researched and wrote his 1966 classic ""In Cold Blood"" -- and somehow gives the sense of the writers entire life. We see Capote at his best and worst at his most manipulative self-serving and maudlin and at his most humane and sensitive. Thats to be expected. Whats entrancing is that Capote is often shown to be at his best and worst in the very same moments. I can think of no recent film that is so expert at conveying -- not ambiguity -- but distinct emotions and motives seemingly contradictory and yet simultaneously at work within a single person. When Capote visits the prison cell of murderer Perry Smith he is sincere and empathetic even as hes manipulative. When he shares with the prisoner a story from his own childhood he is genuinely transported by the memory of past trauma even as hes using the story to gain trust. Capote is never just a caring person or a vampirish artist. Hes always at every moment both. Related Stories Emotions motives clear-cut in Capote Capotes odyssey begins in 1959 with a newspaper item he sees about the shotgun slaying of a family in Kansas. On an assignment from the New Yorker magazine he travels to the small town with his childhood friend Nelle Harper Lee soon to become famous as the author of ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" Lee (Catherine Keener) is an important buffer in those early days as Capote who is strange enough in any context seems positively extraterrestrial in a small-town environment. He is not like other people. He is smarter for one thing. He has considerable charm and he has guts. In an early scene he goes into a chapel where the closed coffins of the four murder victims are set out and he opens one of the coffins. Seemingly fey and effete Capote has no squeamishness in his pursuit of understanding. When the killers are caught the prospective magazine article becomes a book project and Capote becomes fascinated with Perry (Clifton Collins Jr.) with whom he develops a complicated symbiotic bond. A lesser film would have played the Capote-Perry scenes on a single note of Capote coming into an understanding of Perrys pain and of Perry coming into a more enlightened way of being. Instead ""Capote"" depicts a clash of competing unspoken motives. To gain the trust of the murderers Capote gets them better legal representation. But every time he helps them he gives them hope which makes them less likely to tell him any truth that might hang them. Capote is there as an artist looking for material seeking invisibility while they see him as someone who might get them off. The dynamic of the Capote-Perry scenes is bizarre and slightly unwholesome with each side withholding something the other desperately wants. Capote needs to know what really happened on the night of the murders and the murderers need Capotes influence in the outside world. Because we are always aware of what Capote is doing we know when hes lying to Perry but is Perry lying to Capote? We can never know. Every so often we get a glimpse that lets us realize that Perry and his criminal partner Richard Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) exist in a psychic land far from the norm as when they look at Capote weeping for them on death row and seem amused by the curious spectacle of compassion. At the same time we have to wonder if even at their most jaded the killers ever figure out that Capote needs them to be executed or else his book will be diminished. Between the artist and the killers its a toss-up as to who is the most ruthless. Hoffmans is a great performance but hes not alone. Collins matches him moment for moment in their scenes together and Chris Cooper though he doesnt have a lot in the way of dialogue conveys much in attitude thought and reflection as the police chief investigating the murders. Best of all is the self-effacing perfectly pitched performance of Keener as Lee who looks at Capote with the affectionate bemusement of an old friend and gives us a way of seeing him too. -- Advisory This film contains strong language and scenes of graphic violence.

One Capote is the squat frog-faced little party animal in fabulous threads who playing raconteur to Manhattans adoring hipperati flutters his fingers and pays out malice in a reedy warble at once childlike and childish punctuated by the dry mirthless chortle with which he skewers his victims du jour. Worming himself into the good graces of the stoical gatekeepers to the Kansas multiple-murder case that will become the subject of his best-known book the frantic little queen in Capote falls away and his voice turns soft and ingratiating as he whispers the blandishments that will leave them eating out of his hand. Then trying to wheedle one of the murderers into spilling the beans about what happened the night the luckless Clutter family were shot or knifed to death in their beds for a cool 50 Capote barely speaks at all and then only in tight breathy phrases you have to lean close to hear.Just how hooked Capote was on performance becomes clear in an early scene on a train in which his childhood pal Nelle Harper Lee (played with amused detachment by the wonderful Catherine Keener in what may turn out to be the sidekick role of her career) twigs that he has actually paid a porter to rave about his novels and to a close friend yet. In this slow quiet austere movie Hoffmans performance of the performance is part creepy impersonation part evasive interpretation of a man who more than most embodied Walt Whitmans observation that we all contain multitudes. Basing his crisp screenplay on Gerald Clarkes exhaustive Capote biography Dan Futterman confines the action to the years between 1959 and 1966 when Capote researched the murders wrote In Cold Blood and achieved fame as a pioneer of what he bombastically termed the ""nonfiction novel."" In Cold Blood brought Capote something he craved even more than fame money or the steady affection of his lover Jack Dunphy (Bruce Greenwood). It won him mass recognition in the pursuit of which Hoffman shows to perfection he was willing to lie flatter dissemble and betray as necessary. In a wicked blend of the sinister and the sympathetic director Miller (whose last film was the documentary The Cruise about another madman who never shuts up) and Futterman seize on the books title to ponder Capote himself as a kind of murderer of the spirit -- his own and others -- and imply his involvement in the case finished him off both as a productive writer and as a man as handily as it made him a star. If as Capote famously remarked life is a moderately good play with a badly written third act the Clutter murders provided him with one hell of a play and a truly horrific third act -- a free fall into drugs and booze only hinted at in this admirably unexplanatory movie and his inability to complete another book before he died at age 59 in 1984.Capote is also an astute and often very funny study in two Americas setting off the brittle fevered opulence of literary Manhattan against the simplicity of small-town Kansas with its barren wintry landscapes and cramped little houses. Capote himself an escapee from the boondocks to the big city glides between the two helped by Lee the success of whose novel To Kill a Mockingbird burns Capote up and whose superior grasp of the provincial mind clears a path to the taciturn policeman (Chris Cooper) in charge of the Clutter investigation. We see Capote a gifted snooper who once described himself as ""having 50 perceptions a minute to everyone elses five"" prowling the scene of the crime lifting a coffin lid at the funeral parlor with only a small moue of distaste to hint at what hes thinking or feeling. Like a cobra rearing up to pounce on a mouse he sizes up one of the murder suspects -- a sensitive young hood named Perry Smith played by Clifton Collins Jr. with the broody truculence of a young Montgomery Clift -- and goes to work on him with a recitation of the abandoned childhood they share. So muted is Hoffmans rendering of the seduction that we are kept wondering whether Capote really did identify with this troubled young man or merely played him like a piano to get the information he needed. ""Its as if Perry and I grew up in the same house"" Capote tells a skeptical Lee when she calls him on his behavior. ""And one day he got up and went out the back door and I went out the front."" Hoffman cleverly fudges the question of whether Capote is a drama queen or truly believes hes trying to rescue a kindred spirit. The actor wont separate the two and Miller likewise doesnt sit in judgment on Capote even when the writer pries a full confession out of Smith feeds his illusion that the book will help his appeal and refuses to visit him after sentencing until The New Yorkers William Shawn (Bob Balaban) literally drags him there -- then has no trouble attending the execution. The triumph of Capote is that it both grants and shares with him that twisted brew of obsessive identification and monstrous detachment that is the fertile burden of the artist. Capote always maintained that his intention in In Cold Blood was to restore the murderers to their humanity. Capote pays back the compliment and restores him to his in full then slyly slips away.CAPOTE | Directed by BENNETT MILLER | Written by DAN FUTTERMAN | Based on the book by GERALD CLARKE | Produced by CAROLINE BARON WILLIAM VINCE and MICHAEL OHOVEN | Released by Sony Pictures Classics | At selected theaters A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

FACT BOXCapote Starring Philip Seymour Hoffman Catherine Keener Chris Cooper Bob Balaban Clifton Collins Jr. Directed by Bennett Miller Screenplay by Dan Futterman Studio Sony Pictures Classics Rated R YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Philip Seymour Hoffman or Create Your Own Manage Alerts | What Is This? (CNN) -- Let me put this bluntly ""Capote"" is without a doubt one of the best films of the year.And Philip Seymour Hoffman -- who delivers a brilliant performance -- is a sure bet for a best actor nomination come Oscar time. (You can start your Oscar pools now.)Hoffman doesnt impersonate the eccentric author; instead he appears to embody him. He never overly imitates the well-known and often mocked speech patterns or mannerisms of the man but rather nails his essences without turning to parody. (Its saying something that Hoffman who stands 5-foot-10 effortlessly captures the diminutive Capote without ever calling attention to his height.)The film begins in the late 50s when Capote fresh off the success of ""Breakfast at Tiffanys"" reads a short newspaper article in The New York Times about the slaying of a rural Kansas family the Clutters. Capote decides the topic is perfect for The New Yorker magazine an article in which he will show the effect of such a brutal murder on the inhabitants of a small town.In the company of his childhood companion Nelle Harper Lee (Catherine Keener) -- soon to write her one and only novel ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" -- Capote sets off for the small farm community of Holcomb Kansas where the Clutters were killed. Lees soft side helps Capote ingratiate himself in the close-knit and somewhat intolerant community and Capote starts interviewing people.Chris Cooper plays Capotes police guide Kansas investigator Alvin Dewey and hes brilliant as usual. Clifton Collins Jr. and Mark Pelligrino as killers Perry Smith and Richard Hickock play a cat-and-mouse game with Capote always realizing deep down that its the story not their lives that compels the author.Indeed Smith and Capotes relationship entered some gray areas beyond that of subject and reporter and Collins uses that knowledge to the hilt. As for Capote the article became a book and after awhile he knew that ""In Cold Blood"" the book that resulted from his reporting could only have one ending that would be satisfactory as literature -- that of the killers deaths. He would twist himself into knots waiting for it divided between the humanity of caring about his real-life characters and the more brutal desire to satiate his own ego.""Capote"" was directed by Bennett Miller and written by actor-turned-screenwriter Dan Futterman childhood friends who have been pursuing this project for years. Both do an exceptional job with their first major film. Keener is amazing; after years of playing brassy characters in such films as ""Being John Malkovich"" she shows an entirely new side with Lee.But without diminishing the contributions of all ""Capotes"" participants this is Hoffmans film. Hes a delight. Truman Capote was a complicated and competitive man with many demons; Hoffman conveys all sides of him to perfection letting you see the man behind the glasses the voice the pouting humor.Capote with typical hyperbole once said that writing ""In Cold Blood"" was the reason he was born. Ill indulge in hyperbole as well Hoffman was born to play this role. Heres looking forward to acknowledgment of his triumph at Oscar time.

In Capote Philip Seymour Hoffmans brilliant transformation into the mannered writer takes your breath away. The character behind the man Philip Seymour Hoffman portrays the complex author and pop culture icon in Capote. Sony Pictures Classics Though he already has proved himself as one of the finest contemporary actors in films such as Boogie Nights Magnolia and Happiness Hoffman astonishes in his ability to get into Capotes skin. He masters the writers flashy facade wispy voice tics and fey traits. He also reveals the wounded child from Alabama beneath the pompous jet-set persona. The meticulously researched script by Dan Futterman based on the book by Gerald Clarke and the perfectly conceived direction by Bennett Miller (whose only prior directing credit was the 1998 documentary The Cruise) contribute to Capotes far-reaching power. The film centers on Capotes travels in 1959-1965 to Holcomb Kan. to write a magazine piece about a quadruple homicide in the tightly knit community. But he becomes increasingly intrigued by the killers. He spends dozens of hours interviewing them in jail and six years writing what became the best seller In Cold Blood. About the movie Capote     (out of four) Stars Philip Seymour Hoffman Clifton Collins Jr. Catherine Keener Chris Cooper Bruce Greenwood Director Bennett Miller Distributor Sony Pictures Classics Rating R for some violent images and brief strong language Running time 1 hour 54 minutes Opens Friday in New York and Los Angeles The film delves into his fascination and identification with one of the killers Perry Smith (an impressive Clifton Collins Jr.). Both men were abandoned by their mothers and scarred by family turmoil. As Capote explains ""Its as if Perry and I grew up in the same house and he went out the back door and I went out the front."" Capotes sense of compassion is complicated by his revulsion toward the brutal acts as well as his tendency to exploit his subjects. It was as if all is fair in pursuit of a good story. Smith regards Capote -- who brings him books by Thoreau and finds him an appellate lawyer -- as a true friend. Meanwhile Capote mostly wants to plumb the depths of Smiths soul to get at his motivations not to help him but to fashion a devastating blow-by-blow account of the grisly killings. He feels a sort of loneliness-fueled kinship but that doesnt stop him from capitalizing on that connection for literary gain. Much like the palpable sense of dread that pervades In Cold Blood Capote weaves a hypnotically powerful story. Tight close-ups a spare musical score by Mychael Danna and minimal ambient sound heighten the dramatic tension. The complexity of a gifted author as well as his self-aggrandizing nature are what the film focuses on. Hoffman delivers a thrilling and profound Oscar-caliber performance that will haunt viewers well after the movie is over.

Plenty of nightclub comics have already done that. His Truman Capote is a fully fleshed-out portrait that lays bare the creepiest recesses of the writers psyche. I dont think Ive ever seen another performance based on a famous artist that was as psychologically acute or troubling.Scrupulously directed by Bennett Miller in his dramatic feature debut and written by Dan Futterman ""Capote"" wisely centers on the five years in Capotes life 1959-1965 when he composed his landmark ""nonfiction novel"" about the murder of a rural Kansas family the Clutters by two drifters Dick Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) and Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.). He shivers when he first reads about the unsolved murder in the back pages of The New York Times. Not even caring if the killers are caught he seizes upon the story as his ticket to post- ""Breakfast at Tiffanys"" fame. Ever the spoiler he wants to expose a ghastly wound within smalltown America. When the murderers are charged and imprisoned he wheedles his way into their good graces with the grudging aid of his friend novelist-to-be Harper Lee (in a first-rate performance by Catherine Keener). He develops or pretends to develop a sort of erotic fixation on Perry who deludedly sees Capote as his savior. But Capote is interested only in the book and the killers repeated stays of execution threaten to throw a damper on his triumph Without their deaths his masterpiece has no finale. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Bennett and Futterman are putting forth a portrait of the artist as immoralist and at times they seem to be equating Capotes behavior with the murders themselves - an assumption that only self-infatuated aesthetes could be foolish enough to harbor. (Perhaps this is why Collinss performance as Perry is made to carry so little threat). But more often they keep the focus right where it ought to be On the personal betrayals that accompany Capotes ache for literary transcendence. The betrayals were necessary to create ""In Cold Blood."" This is why ""Capote"" is such an unsettlingly ambiguous experience. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 That ambiguity is embodied in Hoffmans matchless performance. Part pasha part genius his Capote is an outsider on the inside. With his raised pinkies baby-blue bathrobes and Bergdorff scarves its easy to spot him as an intruder in the Kansas countryside. But Hoffman makes us aware of how spiritually isolated Capote was even in his beloved New York jet set. Wherever he found himself he was a man immolating in his own slow flame.

"How real is Capote? Slate Sign In Sign Up How Real Is Capote? How Real Is Capote? Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Sept. 29 2005 518 PM The Truman Show Philip Seymour Hoffmans brilliant Capote. By David Edelstein Hoffman disappears into Capote Janet Malcolms brilliant The Journalist and the Murderer opens with the provocative and I think madly overheated assertion that ""Every journalist who is not too stupid or too full of himself to notice what is going on knows what he does is morally indefensible."" This idea of the journalists inevitable betrayal of his or her subject is at the heart of the new film Capote (Sony Pictures Classics) which tells the story-behind-the-story of the writing of In Cold Blood. As directed by Bennett Miller and written by Dan Futterman (who cites Malcolms work in interviews) the grim story of Truman Capote and his seminal nonfiction masterpiece becomes a tale of duplicity and self-loathing--of the loss of a writers soul and the beginning of the end of his artistry. The title character played by Philip Seymour Hoffman is the droll dandy that many of us recall from Capotes TV appearances in the 60s and 70s a pudgy Southerner with a voice that suggests both suckling and conniving the voice of a baby mad scientist. A master manipulator Hoffmans Capote speaks so slowly that his listeners have to stop and hang on his every self-consciously dazzling word. With his books The Grass Harp and Breakfast at Tiffanys his New Yorker articles and his screenplays Capote has a cult following in the boho salons of Manhattan and Brooklyn. But how will his effeminate preening play in Kansas? Advertisement Thats where Capote heads in 1959--along with his doting friend the future To Kill a Mockingbird novelist Harper Lee (a drabbed-down Catherine Keener)--when he reads of the inexplicable slaughter of an entire family the Clutters in their remote farmhouse. Capote cuts a bizarro figure in the American heartland--the look by Chris Cooper as Kansas Bureau of Investigation agent Alvin Dewey is a deadpan howl. But the writer uses his celebrity and the aura surrounding his magazine to open both official doors and jail cells. Its in the latter that he develops an intimacy with one of the Clutters killers Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.). In gentle understanding tones he probes Smiths memories shares his own and nudges the killer toward the big prize a moment-by-moment account of what actually happened in the farmhouse on that hideous night. In a key scene Smith speaks hopefully of the effect Capotes account of their inadequate legal representation will have on the appeal of the convicted killers death sentences; and Capote explains that he hasnt started writing and doesnt even have a title. He has and does of course. He just doesnt plan to finish In Cold Blood until Smith and his cohort Richard Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) have been hanged. The execution is going to be the books big finale. And while Capote cares for Smith maybe even has a whopping crush on him he becomes desperate to see him executed so he can finish the damn thing. Over the years it takes for the killers to exhaust their appeals Capotes inner conflict between his empathy and his opportunism eats him alive. He begins the heavy drinking that were told in an end-title will kill him. Capote is dark and slow and gets darker and slower as it crawls to its emotional climax in which Capote finally extracts from Smith the story of the murders--a climax presented as a triumphant piece of vampirism. Its a fascinating idea--powerful and eerie on many levels (even if in his book Capote places Dewey in the room). But I think somethings missing that Capote transcended that vampirism so that In Cold Blood fostered more understanding of why people kill than any book I know. The depth of the authors humanity is in every finely-chiseled line. I admit I dont know how Futterman and Bennett could have conveyed this split between life and literature but a film about the writing of a book that ignores the alchemy of creation isnt telling the full story. Although New Yorker editor William Shawn (a subdued and surprisingly lifeless Bob Balaban) speaks of Capote changing the face of journalism (he did) Capote views its subjects achievement in the context of his celebrity and Malcolmesque exploitation. There isnt a hint that in the end Capote memorialized Smiths (and Hickocks) pain. The distorted mirror image that Capote told friends he saw in Smith is more talked about than dramatized but the actors fill in some of the holes. As Smith Collins finds the perfect mixture of neediness and cunning. And Hoffman Talk about alchemy When I heard he was cast I was skeptical because hes so much bigger than Capote. But somehow hes framed to look short. (Did other actors stand on platforms? Did Hoffman stand in a hole?) And while youre aware of the nightclub impersonation aspect of the performance in the first few minutes you quickly forget. Hoffman reportedly listened to many tapes of Capote (courtesy of his biographer Gerald Clarke) and sometimes when gifted and porous actors faithfully duplicate the stammers and pauses and delicate rhythms of their subjects they get inside those subjects heads--they become possessed. Thats what obviously happened here Hoffman goes beyond the surface mannerisms and diction. He disappears into Capote. Theres an extraordinary scene that features a good young actress named Allie Mickelson in which Capote seduces the girl (a close friend of the Clutters teenage daughter) by confessing to his own embarrassment at being different. Its devious but true. Hoffman lays bare this whiny wheedling self-absorbed little man who nonetheless could see more deeply than almost anyone alive. If only Capote did more than hint at the transformative genius behind what he saw. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air.

They see ""the way I am the way I talk"" he says; often they see little else. Capote the Southern-bred literary star boozer and gossip queen has journeyed to Holcomb Kan. to do a story for The New Yorker about the murder of the Clutters a modest farm family slaughtered in their home without apparent motive one horrible random night. He senses that the crime its gruesomeness bursting the facade of ""normal"" America has the makings of a drama as potent as any fiction. He is about to spend six tormented years of obsession tearing his soul apart to write the revolutionary true-crime masterpiece In Cold Blood. In Capote the rapt absorbing and thrillingly perceptive biographical drama written by Dan Futterman and directed by Bennett Miller we can see why folks underestimate Capote. Disarming expectations is the key to his method. As a personality he exudes the fey mock exhaustion of a blase munchkin and that makes him easy to dismiss. His voice is a whine that turns into a moan that crests with a sigh topped with a babys gurgle. He sounds like Carol Channing on quaaludes. Hoffman in his sublime must-see feat of a performance plays that famous foppish lilt like a hypnotists instrument getting you to forget in 30 seconds that youre seeing an impersonation. He makes Capote a mesmerizing raconteur who gets people to trust him by nudging his fragility and genius into the center of every encounter. Capote assisted by his friend Harper Lee (Catherine Keener) knows how to use his celebrity to gain access to a communitys secrets. He makes an ally out of Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper) the stern Kansas Bureau of Investigation official and once the killers Dick Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) and Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.) have been captured tried convicted and given the death sentence he bribes the prison warden to gain access to Perry who will become the key figure in his story his portrait of Americas hidden violent heart. The bond between Capote and the moody sensitive Perry is the core of Capote. Visiting Perry behind bars the author becomes his confidant confessor psychiatrist and friend; he even takes on the role in spirit of doting lover. His identification with Perry is an honest one He grew up as such an outsider himself that he looks at this killer and sees a kindred soul. Yet Capotes ruthlessness is there in the way he exploits the friendship in the guise of perpetuating it. He arranges for lawyers to win a stay of execution all because he needs to get the goods from Perry only to abandon the case when it becomes convenient for the killers to die. His ""method"" works yet it eats away at him allowing him to create a seminal book and destroy himself in the process. Hoffman makes Capotes dissolution a theatrical miracle of devastation. In his final scene with Perry hes so conflicted that he does something Ive never seen on screen He cries honestly and lies at the same time. Capote has one nagging flaw. Clifton Collins Jr. plays Perry (strikingly) as a kind of sociopathic James Dean yet he never quite musters the rage of a killer; he lacks the twitches of self-loathing that Perry had in the book and in Robert Blakes portrayal in the 1967 film adaptation of In Cold Blood. That said Capote honors its subject by doing just what Truman Capote did. It teases fascinates and haunts. 2006 Oscar Nominations Best Picture; Best Actor (Philip Seymour Hoffman); Best Supporting Actress (Catherine Keener); Best Director (Bennett Miller); Best Adapted Screenplay (Dan Futterman) Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories Watch Kelly Clarkson adorably forget the lyrics to her songs Katy Perry reveals which line of her DNC speech Orlando Bloom wrote Chandra Levy miniseries in works at TNT Nick Jonas Demi Lovato send fans on scavenger hunt for concert tickets Pokemon Go nests are reportedly spawning different Pokemon Disney changes Avengers Infinity War Part 1 title Constance Wu says Matt Damons Great Wall perpetuates racist myth Photo Galleries 50Scoops50Days The Latest in Fall TV News The Biggest Moments From the 2016 Conventions Crazy Stupid Love Before They Were Stars The Most 2000s Fashion From John Tucker Must Die Exclusive Photos of The Walking Dead Season 7 27 Great Revenge Movies Alice in Wonderland Witticisms and Wisdom From the Disney Classic From Our Partners From Our Partners Contact UsCustomer ServiceAbout UsJobs at Time Inc.AdvertisePrivacy PolicyYour California Privacy RightsAd ChoicesNewslettersSubscribeTerms of ServiceSite Map Copyright (c) 2016 Entertainment Weekly Inc.

"Capote | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; capote ) Capote (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Capote tells two stories presenting both without hiccups. The first is an exposA(c) of how the title authors In Cold Blood was written. The second shows the emotional and psychic dissolution of the man who starts out the film as a brilliant eccentric and finishes it as a basket case. In Cold Blood made Truman Capote a household name and led to him being ranked as one of the greatest American writers. It also destroyed him. He would never complete another book and less than 20 years after finishing In Cold Blood he would die of a drug overdose. Great authors often live unhappy lives. After his experiences putting together his legacy work Capotes became almost unbearable. Bennett Millers motion picture shows how obsession and self-absorption developed from personality traits into personal demons. Capote opens in 1959. The title character (Philip Seymour Hoffman) tired of writing fiction has decided to investigate four Kanas murders as a possible subject for a non-fiction article in the New Yorker magazine. With him he takes his good friend Nelle Harper Lee (Catherine Keener) who has recently completed her manuscript for To Kill a Mockingbird. The local police chief (Chris Cooper) offers reluctant cooperation. After the killers - Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.) and Richard Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) - are captured Capotes interviews with Perry result in a twisted form of bonding and co-dependency. There is manipulation and empathy on both sides. At one point Truman remarks ""Its as if Perry and I grew up in the same house. One day I went out the front door and he went out the back."" Eventually with the appeals process prolonging the execution of the death penalty Truman reaches the point where he wants Perry to be hanged so this nightmarish phase of his life can reach closure. ""All I want to do is write the ending and theres no end in sight"" he laments. One cannot write about this film without tossing superlatives in the direction of Philip Seymour Hoffman whose performance will earn him an Oscar nomination. Hoffman doesnt merely imitate Capote. He inhabits him with an intensity that demands acknowledgement from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Catherine Keener Chris Cooper and Clifton Collins Jr. offer support but this is Hoffmans movie from start to finish. Underrated for most of his career this role will allow him to take his turn in the spotlight. Capote is a deep movie with rich veins to mine. The lead character is not likeable. He is a user who exploits his relationship with Perry for personal gain. At the beginning he doesnt know what it will ultimately cost him. As the movie develops we see the complex love-and-hate association with Perry and how this results in the slow erosion of Capotes personality. The brilliance of Bennetts movie is that it concentrates on the characters and their interaction and never becomes a mouthpiece for one side or the other with respect to the death penalty. It would have been easy to turn Capote into a polemic but Bennett resists the urge. Although I had a stronger connection with Capote on an intellectual level than on an emotional level (I never came close to shedding a tear) the experience stayed with me for some time. Thats unusual for something I see for the first time in the midst of a film festival. (In this case Toronto.) Normally movies falling into a mid-day slot leave a minimal aftertaste before being washed away by the next feature but not this one. Capote is strong medicine that will demand recognition at next years Oscars.

The creation of a milestone in both modern literature and journalism -- which became a memorable 1967 movie -- is explored to reveal yet more riveting layers in ""Capote"" an unsettlingly intimate account of Truman Capotes obsessive research into the brutal 1959 killings of a Kansas family that yielded the groundbreaking faction work ""In Cold Blood."" The mesmerizing performance of Philip Seymour Hoffman as the celebrated writer dominates every scene while director Bennett Miller and screenwriter Dan Futtermans penetrating study enthralls in every aspect making this Sony Pictures Classics release sure to figure high among the falls prestige specialty draws. Inherited by SPC from United Artists ""Capote"" is the first of two indie projects on the same period in the subjects life each culled from major biographies -- in this case Gerald Clarkes probing compassionate 1988 book. Due in 2006 from Warner Independent Pictures is Doug McGraths ""Have You Heard?"" based on George Plimptons 1997 assembly of recollections from those who knew Capote. The first narrative feature from Miller (1998 docu-portrait ""The Cruise"") and the first screenplay penned by actor Futterman (best known for roles in ""The Birdcage"" and ""Will amp; Grace"") the films most notable qualities perhaps are its quiet perceptiveness and unhurried sense of purpose showing a sure-footedness and maturity that usually are the domain of far more experienced filmmakers. Futterman takes small liberties with the events and persons but his approach is one of measured respectfulness. Theres a graceful calibration and balance evident in the central positioning of Capote among opposites. Complete with an uncannily precise take on the prissy infantile voice and with all the authors characteristically fey mannerisms -- the batted eyelashes; the hands constantly fluttering to adjust his hair and glasses; the languid flourish with which he waves a cigarette a martini or telephone; the perpetually raised pinkie -- Hoffmans Capote is Southern flamboyance taken to baroque extremes yet at all times vulnerable and real. One of his closest associates during the period portrayed here is Nelle Harper Lee (Catherine Keener) then on the cusp of fame with ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" The polar opposite of her childhood friend shes the epitome of another kind of Southerner down-to-earth plain-spoken unpretentious. No less distinct from the central character is William Shawn (Bob Balaban) Capotes sedate gentlemanly editor at The New Yorker who agreed to the authors request to go to Kansas and write a story on the impact of the Clutter family killings on rural Holcomb. Likewise Capotes straight-up dependable longtime companion Jack Dunphy (Bruce Greenwood) and the taciturn masculine Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper) the Kansas Bureau of Investigation agent who led the hunt for the two ex-con drifters responsible for the murders Dick Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) and Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.). The depiction of Capote as a social alien -- even when holding court at the Gotham soirees that were far more germane to him than Kansas farm country -- adds poignancy to the sense of kindred misunderstood spirits that evolves between the writer and Smith. The convicted killer transfixes Truman from his first sight of him to his much-delayed execution fueling the writers creative genius but also destabilizing him emotionally. In many ways this is a tragic story of unfulfilled love. ""Its as if Perry and I grew up in the same house and he stood up and went out the back door while I went out the front"" says Capote. The film succeeds remarkably in tracing the process by which Truman gained the trust and esteem of a man he described as ""remote suspicious sullenly sleepy-eyed"" -- all qualities brought to wounded life in Collins deeply etched performance. But whats most affecting is the double edge of Capotes literary achievement -- he invented the ""non-fiction novel"" with ""In Cold Blood"" which brought him for the first time to a mass audience -- and the shattering personal cost at which it came. He never completed another book later descending into alcoholism and obesity burning bridges with his rich socialite pals. Futtermans script addresses with honesty the unpaid debt of a writer to his subject as well as touching eloquently on the creative process the bonding between misunderstood outcasts the randomness of violent crime and the inhumanity of taking a life on either side of the law. The film also acknowledges as Capote did the thin divide between quiet conservative American life and its violent underbelly. Hoffman never shies away from painting the subject as a vain self-absorbed spotlight-seeker and a guileful manipulator milking Smith and Hickocks death row agony for personal and professional glorification. But even when impatiently awaiting an execution date to give his book an ending when deceiving Smith or using vicious dismissive words to hurt him Truman never becomes an entirely unsympathetic monster; the impact on the writer of the two mens complex association is made achingly palpable. Capotes refusal to take notes during interviews allows for constantly locked eyes which cranks up the intensity and intimacy of his encounters with Smith to almost painful levels in scenes shot in uneasy close-up. Playing a brilliant man who presented himself as a caricature and was the target of endless comic impersonations for it Hoffmans achievement in giving him dignity and soul is impressive indeed. While the actors height works against physical accuracy as the diminutive author the depths and sensitivity of his characterization overcome any doubts. In addition to the arresting work of Collins unerring support comes especially via subtle turns from Keener Cooper and Pellegrino while stage actress Amy Ryan has lovely moments as Deweys wife whose welcome breaks down barriers for Truman with the Kansans. In a movie refreshing for its lack of flash the frugal use of handheld camera in Trumans shaken final encounter with Hickock and Smith before their hanging is emotionally effective. Elsewhere Adam Kimmels controlled camera work creates a textured grainy visual field its retro flavor enhanced by a desaturated color palette and a painterly eye for the empty wintry landscapes. (Canadian locations stood in for the Kansas prairies.)
