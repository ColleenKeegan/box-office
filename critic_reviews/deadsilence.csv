Comments Dead Silence Director James Wan and screenwriter Leigh Whannell who hit the jackpot with Saw reunite for this lurid spook show involving sinister ventriloquism dolls a gimmick that hasnt gotten much play since the old Anthony Hopkins thriller Magic (1978). As Saw demonstrated Wan and Whannell have a carnivalesque sense of fun and a sure instinct for recycling classic horror tropes but their characters are so flat and their plotting so listless that this low-budget feature fails to generate much suspense. With Donnie Wahlberg reprising his rumpled police detective routine from Saw II. R 90 min. By J.R.

Its fog-wreathed graveyards and spooky sets are CGI-enhanced but its twentysomething protagonist - though haunted by his familys murky past - is very much of our time. Sadly the overall effect is more creaky than creepy. Insipid Home and Away alumnus Ryan Kwanten plays Jamie Ashen whose claims that his wife was murdered by a ventriloquists doll fall on deaf ears where cynical cop Jim Lipton (Donnie Wahlberg) is concerned. Lipton follows Jamie and the doll to the moribund community of Ravens Fair where Jamie uncovers a dark family secret. Even if you find the staring eyes and flapping mouths of ventriloquist dolls scary theres a homage-by-numbers feel to the sins of the fathers plot with its references to Mario Bava movies and Edgar Allan Poe. Its affectionately done but rather pointless.

Turns out the dummys cursed -- something about an old-lady ventriloquist whose lips moved. Now in vengeful spirit form she goes around tearing out tongues -- but not fast enough to stop the awful dialogue e.g. ""She wont stop killing until the screaming does"" Eesh.

What auds are far more likely to contract is a fear of ventriloquist-dummy movies for which there is no name and no apparent cure. Only those in a cold sweat for their weekly horror fix will bother with this formulaic and rather lazy exercise in booga-booga scare tactics. ""Automatonophobia"" is what we call a fear of ventriloquist dummies a phobia unlikely to be induced by ""Dead Silence"" an ostensible exercise in horror from the writing-directing team behind ""Saw."" What auds are far more likely to contract is a fear of ventriloquist-dummy movies for which there is no name and no apparent cure. Only those in a cold sweat for their weekly horror fix will bother with this formulaic and rather lazy exercise in booga-booga scare tactics. To say the dummy has more personality than the live cast would be an overstatement. But with the exceptions of the underused Donnie Wahlberg (as Detective Lipton a guy whos constantly shaving and still looks like Yasser Arafat) and model Amber Valletta in perhaps her biggest role yet its a colorless collection of the living while the possessed dummy resembles an Austrian waiter in a post-war Marlene Dietrich movie. Jamie Ashen (Ryan Kwanten) is actually one of the sharper characters yet seen in a horror film The day after he receives a package containing Billy the dummy his wife is grotesquely murdered and Jamie actually puts two and two together. It usually takes hours for a guy in this position to figure out that the inanimate object is causing all the mayhem. So snaps to Jamie. Thus its beyond anyones comprehension why he keeps dragging the little guy around instead of feeding him into the first available wood-chipper. But there are of course about 85 tedious minutes left in the movie. ""Dead Silence"" is the type of film in which a character -- such as the long-suffering Henry Walker (Michael Fairman) who knows all about Mary Shaw (Judith Roberts) the demon ventriloquist murdered by the townsfolk of Ravens Fair so many years ago -- sets out to dig a grave with a snow shovel. Or in which someone hands off an old-style phone receiver with no wire attached. Or in which a local movie theater is accessible only by rowboat which Jamie in a metaphor for something propels with one oar. Maybe it was the theater in which this reviewer watched ""Dead Silence"" but the film is dark -- not in service of a creepy tone but in the cause of myopia-inducing eyestrain. Places look like sets; reaction shots are gratuitous (if understandable enough when meant to give Valletta as much screen time as possible). But when a character inevitably asks ""Whos the dummy now?"" paying customers will know the answer. Dead SilenceProductionA Universal release of a Burg/Koules/Hoffman production.

"Silence is too conflicted to compel - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Silence is too conflicted to compel By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  March 17 2007 Not only does ""Dead Silence"" bring the killer dummy back to horror films it reunites director James Wan and screenwriter Leigh Whannell  the two dudes who made sadomasochism profitable again with ""Saw."" This new movie is a more credible less grisly act of filmmaking (""Saw"" was jittery and seemingly caked with grime) but its a less compelling exercise. It doesnt have the ruthless moral reasoning of the first two ""Saw"" pictures however grotesque and specious that reasoning was. But it does have a plot that revolves around a ventriloquist and her demon doll.Most of the movie requires Jamie (Ryan Kwanten ) to drive to an ashen hamlet called Ravens Fair and find out who left a dummy outside his apartment door and what on earth made it kill his wife. If it even did. His estranged father (Bob Gunton ) claims ignorance as does his latest wife (Amber Valletta ). (Valletta is doing double horror duty this weekend also taking up space in the tedious new Sandra Bullock spook-fest ""Premonition."")Donnie Wahlberg  who was the abused detective in the last two ""Saw"" films plays a more nonsensical detective here. The picture of levity he follows Jamie all over Ravens Fair rubbing his stubbled face with an electric shaver. While Wahlberg sends up his ""Saw"" role Jamie discovers that the local coroner (Michael Fairman ) has some answers. They point toward the legend of crazy Mary Shaw (Judith Roberts ) who in the olden days might have taken her ventriloquism act too far after a kid in the audience interrupts her act to tell everybody he can see her lips moving. The kid vanishes the townsfolk form a lynch mob and Mary is never heard from again. Not in the flesh anyway.The flashback to the kids interruption is legitimately creepy Its not Mary who was insulted but her wooden partner. They argue in front of the crowd talking over each other. So what initially seemed merely freakish about Mary and Billy suddenly seems full of evil. For that one sequence ""Dead Silence"" has ""Psycho""-like eeriness that you wish Wan and Whannell could sustain for an entire feature.These two have a shred of talent (probably more) and theres a Gothic awfulness about their story. But they tell it through rushed montages that cheapen the sensation of discovery and leave an audiences craving for shock unfulfilled. And its not as if theyre trying to subvert the horror genre. Their every move seems cribbed from other places and their movies ultimately are about obeying rules or adhering to convention (whether its the genres or their own).To their credit Wan and Whannell dont make cookie-cutter video-game fodder. They clearly love horror. But seemingly torn here between trying to scare us and top themselves they do neither.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Starring Ryan Kwanten Amber Valletta Donnie Wahlberg and Bob Gunton. Directed by James Wan. (R. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. See complete movie listings and show times and buy tickets for select theaters at SFGate.com/movies.) It becomes clear early on that Billy the killer ventriloquist dummy in ""Dead Silence"" wouldnt stand a chance against an A-list homicidal doll such as Chucky from ""Childs Play."" Half of Sesame Street could probably beat him down in a fair fight -- and yes that includes Elmo. ""Saw"" creators James Wan and Leigh Whannell attempt something artsy with their latest movie and all the moody lighting and film school camera tricks come at the expense of the thrills that modern horror film audiences demand. Theyre the filmmaking equivalent of strippers who are convinced people come to gentlemens clubs for the technical skills of the dancers. Ryan Kwanten is Jamie who doesnt seem concerned that a creepy-looking puppet that resembles Steve Buscemi has arrived on his doorstep. When Jamie comes home a few hours later to find his wifes tongue ripped out he makes the only logical move place the dummy in the passenger seat of his muscle car and visit his estranged father. Lurking in the shadows is the ghost of Mary Shaw a ventriloquist who was killed by an angry mob of townspeople. Assuming you can complete that crossword in the back of People magazine (18 Across ""Gone With the ____"") you should figure out the twist ending in the first half of the movie although its still shocking in its stupidity when it arrives. Theres no attempt at humor in ""Dead Silence"" but the biggest sin in the film is the lack of scares. At one point the puppet from ""Saw"" is clearly visible in the background and its a reminder how much this movie could use a bear trap that will drop some womans head in a vat of acid if her boyfriend doesnt slice his own fingers and toes off with a pizza cutter. (Permission granted to use that for ""Saw IV."") ""Dead Silence"" doesnt push the limits of its R rating and theres one too many scenes with Billys eyes moving to the left or right while ominous music plays. The movie does have a visual panache but Wan is a bit too enamored with blue camera filters allowing just the occasional splash of yellow or red. That only looks cool in ""Schindlers List"" not a movie about puppets that cut peoples tongues out. Advisory This movie contains some strong language and gory scares. Fans of New Kids on the Block may also be disturbed by co-star Donnie Wahlberg who suddenly looks way too much like Floyd the barber from ""The Andy Griffith Show.""
