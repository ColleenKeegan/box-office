With enough toilet and booty humor to keep anklebiters giggling toon could serve well as a younger-skewing lead-in to the return of ""The Mullets"" on Wednesday nights. CGI animation frequently is derided for seeming too sterile and devoid of emotion when compared with art created by the human hand. UPNs ""Game Over"" the first entirely computer-animated comedy in primetime embraces this perception and runs with it. Set in the world of videogame characters the angular look adds to the action instead of detracting from it. With enough toilet and booty humor to keep anklebiters giggling toon could serve well as a younger-skewing lead-in to the return of ""The Mullets"" on Wednesday nights. Rip Smashenburn (voiced by Patrick Warburton) is so dedicated to his vidgame job as a race car driver that he sleeps in pajamas with a black-and-white flag pattern. His wife Raquel (Lucy Liu) is gamefully employed by mysterious Dr. Zed to raid tombs (get it?) around the world. Kids Billy (E.G. Daily) and Alice (Rachel Dratch) have yet to train for a particular game and instead dedicate themselves to stereotypical adolescent complaining and pouting in the virtual world. Vocal talents and character animation are all above par with Rip bearing more than a passing resemblance to Warburton and Raquel looking dead-on like va-va-voom hot mom Melinda Clarke on ""The OC."" In ""Meet the Smashenburns"" the first of three episodes provided for review Rip is overwhelmed by the teen angst in his house and takes the kids to a pet store in the hopes that having a critter around will unite the family. After being tempted with a number of wide-eyed Pokemon-esque characters they wind up with foul-mouthed cigar-smoking Jack Daniel-drinking malcontent Turbo (Artie Lange). Show would be better to drop the traditional sitcom stylings -- yes a lesson is learned by the end of each episode -- and instead go for broke with the vulgar humor. If the show veers more toward Fox/Comedy Centrals ""The Family Guy"" and away from the familiar primetime sitcom look for the critical college aud to make it a cult fave. Creative homages to scenes from popular videogames are there for the sharp-eyed to spot In one scene a frog dashes across a busy road a la ""Frogger""; in another Billy grinds down an escalator handrail on his skateboard like a player in ""Tony Hawks Pro Skater."" The danger in this format of course is that watching these videogame characters on TV may remind kids of all the games they have waiting to be played -- and its only a flick of a switch to turn off the tube and turn on the PlayStation.

Rather than merely startling the audience by hurtling things toward it Spy Kids creates a vivid fantasy world that is all the more alive in 3-D. Daryl Sabaras character has to save his sister (Alexa Vega) in Spy Kids 3-D Game Over. It also has a sweet message about the importance of family forgiveness and fairness but never feels didactic or saccharine. And it makes a potent statement about disabilities. Review of the movie Spy Kids 3-D Game Over ( out of four) Stars Daryl Sabara Alexa Vega Ricardo Montalban Sylvester Stallone Director Robert Rodriguez Distributor Dimension Films Rating PG for action sequences and peril Opens Friday nationwide Ricardo Montalban as the spy kids grandfather is confined to a wheelchair -- upholstered of course in Corinthian leather. When he morphs into a superhero during one sequence he explains to Juni (Daryl Sabara) that he still feels strong and competent inside and would love to see his grandson look at him with pride even when hes not bounding about heroically. Its not often that movies gently remind kids to respect their elders and look past their frailties. Still any message no matter how worthwhile would likely fall on deaf ears if the movie didnt deliver the action and excitement expected from the Spy Kids franchise. And this third installment follows up on the thrills and dazzling visuals that charmed audiences in the first film. Juni has grown disillusioned with the family business and left the spy racket but hes called back to save his sister Carmen (Alexa Vega) who is imprisoned inside a video game. The game was created by a madman (Sylvester Stallone) bent on controlling the minds of all the worlds youth. Stallone who has four additional comic roles is a rather dull villain probably the films only weak link. The kids are improving as actors but the technology -- pulled off with panache by director Robert Rodriguez -- is clearly the star. (To compensate for the awkwardness of putting on and taking off the special viewing glasses the audience is cleverly instructed on their use by the loopy Alan Cumming who plays Floop a kids show host.) Some of the films extended cameos are great too Salma Hayek as a top-level agent Elijah Wood as the guru within the video game and George Clooney as the surprisingly presidential commander in chief. Toward the end of the film Antonio Banderas the spy kids dad communicates a life-affirming message to the parents in the audience ""This is the most important moment of my life"" he mutters as he examines a tiny brain that has obsessed him since the first film. ""No one can disturb me now."" Then he gets a message on a loudspeaker that his children need his help. He drops everything and runs to their aid. Amid the razzle-dazzle Spy Kids 3-D Game Over is sweetly inspiring.

Starring Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara. Directed by Robert Rodriguez. (PG. 88 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Spy Kids 3-D Game Over"" can best be appreciated as an event rather than as a movie an occasion for kids to enjoy the novelty of 3-D and go home with a pair of souvenir cardboard sunglasses. Think of it that way -- as the cinematic equivalent of a theme park -- and it becomes easier not to mind that this is the weakest ""Spy Kids"" entry a movie that starts off with a burst of energy but becomes tedious midway through. Director Robert Rodriguez who created this imaginative series seems to have an idea of what the ""Spy Kids"" movies should mean -- something about love loyalty and responsibility -- but the results this time are much less than he intends. For the first time the movies celebration of family which previously seemed natural seems forced. Rodriguez attempts to satirize kids obsession with video games but ends up making a movie thats not much better than one most of it taking place in a virtual video world. Still when Alan Cumming comes out at the start and gives instructions to the audience about when to put on the 3-D glasses a feeling of anticipated fun flows through the crowd -- and it takes a while for that feeling to leave. The movies conceit is that teenage secret agent Carmen Cortez (Alexa Vega) has become mentally trapped inside a video game making it necessary for her younger brother Juni (Daryl Sabara) to follow her into this virtual world. When he does the real world -- in two dimensions -- gives way to the games 3- D virtual reality. The premise is witty. The video game is a national security issue because the criminal mastermind behind it -- the Toymaker -- wants to use it to enslave the mind of every kid on the planet. Sylvester Stallone plays the maniacal Toymaker as well as three incarnations of the villains multiple personalities a hippie a militarist and a scholar. Its a nice showcase for the comic skill of Stallone who has always had a healthy sense of humor about himself. Unfortunately ""Spy Kids 3-D"" falls down in the one aspect it needed to succeed in its rendering of three dimensions. The two-dimensional scenes are gorgeous flooded with rich color detail and depth of field. But the 3-D scenes which constitute most of the films running time are blurry and murky. The colors look washed out and dominated by a greenish or bluish tint. The 3- D effect is no better here than in ""Kiss Me Kate"" in 1953 and in one way its worse because a half century later -- thanks to IMAX -- we have an idea of 3- Ds true possibilities. So what seems so promising at the start degenerates into nothing much but kids stuck in a murky greenish 3-D world. Young Sabara is a likable child actor but hes left to carry much of the movie without Vega and to do so in scenes that repeat one another. He needs to make it to Level Five of the game but keeps getting thwarted again and again. It becomes tiresome. Ricardo Montalban shows up as the kids grandfather and Rodriguez throws a bone to the old-timers by having Grandpa say something about ""Corinthian leather"" -- a reference to Montalbans Chrysler Cordoba commercials which were ubiquitous in the 1970s. Thats good for a laugh. So is the scene where George Clooney as the president morphs into Stallone. The first sign Clooney deepens his voice and starts slurring his words. Advisory This film contains fantasy peril and violence.
