Roald Dahls 1970 childrens book ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is the second such classic to make it to the screen this season the other being Maurice Sendaks ""Where the Wild Things Are."" While not as original or deeply felt as the Spike Jonze film the stop-motion animated ""Fox"" has its pleasures foremost being its look - a sophisticated puppet primitivism backdropped by near-psychedelic colorations. George Clooney voices the dapper Mr. Fox who leads a grab bag of critters on missions of plunder. Wes Anderson directed from a script he co-wrote with Noah Baumbach of the ""Squid and the Whale"" (who has moved on to foxes and opossums). Sometimes too clever by half the film replete with in-jokes may in some ways work better for adults. Meryl Streep Bill Murray and Jason Schwarztman also provide adept voice work.

I pondered that as I watched Fantastic Mr. Fox only a week after taking in the bloated and pricey A Christmas Carol. Evidently Christmas Carol cost around five times what Fantastic Mr. Fox did. And yet Fantastic Mr. Fox is 10 times the film of the Zemeckis effort. Could it be that Wes Anderson was forced to make more hard decisions had less resources to work with and thus knocked it right out of the park? The admittedly anecdotal results seem clear but well table that discussion since its too broad a topic to tackle in what should be Fantastic Mr. Foxs moment in the sun. Fantastic Mr. Fox is a delight. Really. Solid for adults potentially captivating for little people enjoyable on every level. A ""top 10 of the year"" caliber of film. You should go see this one. Youd probably like it. What are you waiting for? I see. Youre not sold yet. Fair enough. Lets get into this thing. The story is adapted from a classic childrens book by Roald Dahl he of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory fame. Mr. Fox (voiced by George Clooney) plays a walking talking motorcycle-riding fox. Hes married has kids and holds down a respectable job as a writer. Trouble arises when he decides to pursue his previous vocation breaking and entering with the intent to burgle from baddies Boggis Bunce and Bean. I cant speak to how faithful the process of taking the film from page to screen was so I could see some grumbling there. Its also a very whimsical tale and your enjoyment of the work could come down to your feelings for Wes Andersons style. For instance if you hated something like Rushmore then the stop-motion Fantastic Mr. Fox will probably have a tough time winning you over. I think youre wrong to dislike either one of them -- they are both clever and sublime -- but its a free country and all. What really sparkles in Fantastic Mr. Fox is the pacing and dialogue. Andersons film has its own cadence and as he draws you into his weird universe youll realize a couple of things. First off Fantastic Mr. Fox is the road less traveled in modern cinema Anderson is attempting something dynamic with each breath of this film and you cant anticipate what hell do next. Also Fantastic Mr. Fox does have a central message but getting there is the fun part. Its not a traditional narrative in the sense of 1) setup 2) middle or 3) culmination; instead the film is stacked with little setups middle parts and culminations throughout. The end is a beginning and like most great films the beginning features a culmination. What Im getting at is that Fantastic Mr. Fox doesnt follow the rules laid out by focus groups and marketing experts. It makes its own rules exemplified by the game of ""whackball"" the movie so colorfully explains. The look of Fantastic Mr. Fox deserves a whole nother review entirely. Stop-motion was used meaning that every second of the film was painstakingly cobbled together by moving around physical matter. But Fantastic Mr. Fox looks and feels completely fluid. This isnt the Rudolph The Red-Nose Reindeer you recall from your childhood its much more seamless and visually effective. The voice work is also top-notch; evidently Mr. Anderson recorded outside of the studio to attain a more organic and authentic sounding audio track. Whatever the method it all works and the 88 minutes fly by. This is a world you want to stay in with characters youre interested to learn about. Take a child or loved one make it a date night or a matinee enjoy the wry humor Wes has gifted you. Theres a moment in the film where Mr. Fox mentions that the shortcut actually takes longer than the scenic route so why not enjoy the view and get ahead? The same could be said of the stylish and bold Fantastic Mr. Fox a boisterous and magnificent treat.

"Movie review Ann Hornaday on Fantastic Mr. Fox with George Clooney washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Fantastic Mr. Fox Movie review Ann Hornaday on Fantastic Mr. Fox with George Clooney Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday November 27 2009 ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" Wes Andersons stop-motion animated adaptation of the Roald Dahl childrens book operates on a couple of frequencies. As a PG-rated film featuring talking animal puppets a cool soundtrack and plenty of sub-rosa humor it qualifies as that rare holiday movie the entire family can enjoy. And as a self-consciously quirky movie that manages to be twee and ultra-hip at the same time it qualifies as yet another wry carefully composed bibelot in the cabinet of curios that defines the Anderson oeuvre. ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" features the voice of George Clooney as the title character who as the movie opens is stealing squabs only to be apprehended and were meant to assume rehabilitated. Two years later hes living in cozy domesticity with Mrs. Fox (voiced by Meryl Streep) and their son Ash (Jason Schwartzman) and working as a journalist a profession only slightly less disreputable than the one he had before. Still the dapper cosmopolitan Mr. Fox is experiencing a bout of midlife dissatisfaction which he addresses first by buying a house far beyond his means in a very grand tree then by reverting to his poultry-stealing ways and when his recidivism threatens his entire community taking his family and neighbors with him on an ""Oceans Eleven""-type spree. From the awkward herky-jerky movements of the title character who looks like hes walking around on fur-covered stilts to the movies rich autumnal palette of russets and golds ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" sticks to an adamantly laid-back low-key vibe offering a welcome respite from the whiz-bang computer effects and 3-D hype of current animated movies. Anderson (""Rushmore"" ""The Royal Tenenbaums"") can sometimes be too knowingly with-it for his own good; like when he casts Brit rocker Jarvis Cocker in a cameo role. But for the most part ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" ambles along with a genteel understated sense of whimsy and warmth. Thats Anderson rep player Owen Wilson in one of the movies funniest scenes when he explains the rules to a fictional game called ""whack-bat.""  PG. At area theaters.

"Fantastic Mr. Fox The hipster and the chicken thief | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesFantastic Mr. Fox The hipster and the chicken thiefThe word ""cool"" in the hipster sense never appears in the writings of Roald Dahl nor does - God forbid - the word ""hipster.""George Clooney voices Mr. Fox.  (SUPPLIED IMAGE)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticWed. Nov. 25 2009 Animated comedy featuring the voices of George Clooney Meryl Streep Bill Murray Jason Schwartzman Willem Dafoe and Owen Wilson. Directed by Wes Anderson. 87 minutes. At major theatres. PG The word ""cool"" in the hipster sense never appears in the writings of Roald Dahl nor does - God forbid - the word ""hipster.""Which makes it somewhat puzzling that dedicated hipster Wes Anderson a Texas filmmaker now living in chic Parisian exile would be attracted to Fantastic Mr. Fox Dahls veddy British bedtime story about a furry chicken thief.Article Continued BelowHas Anderson tired of filming human foibles? Not at all. He has simply transplanted his humans (his most A-list cast to date) to an animal setting using a beloved childrens tale as backdrop and stop-motion animation as his conceit.The result is not only marvellous whimsy but also something that advances the burgeoning retro-tech movement. In an age when everything seems digital computer-driven and as fake as instant coffee more and more artists (Spike Jonze and John Lasseter among them) are embracing the old ways of vinyl records hand-drawn cartoons and painstaking stop-motion character movements.How much of this is intended or accidental from Andersons perspective is open to debate since he reportedly directed Fantastic Mr. Fox entirely by email and video chat. According to Tristan Oliver his director of photography and Mark Gustafson his director of animation Anderson left them to do the heavy lifting in London while he barked orders from Paris. Can art be created from a distance? Did Anderson outfox or badger his underlings? Discuss.Whatever the truth is Fantastic Mr. Fox feels like a Wes Anderson picture through and through and maybe thats all that matters. Theres the familiar existential angst (you dont read those words in Dahl either) the fascination with minutiae and the agreeably perverse soundtrack that thinks nothing of lifting from the disparate likes of the Rolling Stones Burl Ives and ""The Ballad of Davy Crockett"" in its quest for coolness.Few could argue with Andersons instincts that Fantastic Mr. Fox just looks so much better than if it had been constructed on an iMac. The fur and costumes are real the puppets feel the weight of gravity and the swish of wind and the autumnal splendour of the colour palette is so evocative it makes you want to just book off work and join Mr. Fox (George Clooney) in his foxhole.Except that would mean joining Mr. Fox in the most dangerous of assignments since he is about to go back on a promise he made 12 years earlier to his wife Felicity (Meryl Streep) that he would mend his chicken-stealing ways and settle down to raise their soon-to-arrive son Ash (Jason Schwartzman).Mr. Fox is now a successful newspaper columnist and snappy dresser (designer corduroy from nose to tail) as well as a devoted father to Ash but middle-aged doubts have crept in. Hes no longer happy living in a hole and wants to relocate to fancier digs in a tree atop a hill and hes eager to return to a life of ""pure wild animal craziness."" His lawyer Badger (Bill Murray) warns him that the tree is within shooting distance of the farms of Boggis Bunce and Bean ""three of the meanest nastiest ugliest farmers in this valley."" Theres no doubt of that - the farmers guard their chickens ducks turkeys and apple cider like gold - but Mr. Fox is not to be deterred. He plans the proverbial ""one last big job"" both to replenish the larder and to prove he still has foxy cojones.Has Clooney ever played a more heroic character? He even rides a motorcycle after a fashion. Yet he harbours personal doubts.""Who am I?"" he asks his opossum pal Kylie (Wallace Wolodarsky). ""And how can a fox ever be happy without youll forgive the expression a chicken in its teeth?""It has become the norm rather than the exception of late for animated films to be aimed more at adults than children. Happily Fantastic Mr. Fox isnt one of these. Anderson and his co-writer Noah Baumbach have made a few modest diversions from Dahls text but they remain faithful to its essential good spirit and sense of wonder at the natural world. There is no serious cussing - the word ""cuss"" is comically taken to be a cuss between Fox and Badger - and nothing that would bring a blush to the face of a maiden aunt human or otherwise.Kids and adults will both love it perhaps for different reasons but theyll love it all the same.Read more about George ClooneyThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Mr. Fox is itching for a henhouse raid in Fantastic Mr. Fox. Photo FOX SEARCHLIGHT PICTURES Fantastic Mr. Fox 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Wes Anderson loves to lay on the weird. In 2007sThe Darjeeling Limited and every other film that came before it the writer-directors dominant themes have been oddballs; dysfunctional families; oddball dysfunctional families; and drily amusing existential crises. Whether his oeuvre strikes you as genius or pretentious deadpan hooey depends an awful lot on your tolerance for quirk. Mine is fairly high. But even those who loathed The Royal Tenenbaums should grin like idiots through Fantastic Mr. Fox a sprightly animated tale about chicken-stealing predators that boasts Andersons trademark eccentricity but ditches (most of) his affectation. Adapted by Anderson and frequent collaborator Noah Baumbach from the Roald Dahl novel the movie uses old-fangled stop-motion techniques to tell the story of its dapper title character a smooth-talking canid in a double-breasted suit. (Hes voiced by George Clooney as well he should be.) In the opening sequence he and his very classy wife (Meryl Streep) get nabbed in a fox trap after pilfering squabs. Mrs. Fox announcing shes pregnant makes Mr. Fox vow to give up his thieving ways if they manage to get out of there alive. Two years later (or ""12 FOX YEARS"" as a title card explains) our hero has a new home a badger(ing) lawyer (Bill Murray) a misfit son (Jason Schwartzman precious articulation intact) and a visiting nephew (Eric Chase Anderson) skilled in the arts of karate meditation yoga and something called Whack-Bat. Mr. Fox has been feeling rather emasculated in his work as a newspaper columnist and he itches for one last henhouse raid. In cahoots with a well-meaning but totally spaced-out possum (Wally Wolodarsky) he plans an assault on Boggis Bunce and Bean three foul fowl farmers across the way. Thus Oceans Umpteen commences in earnest. Or as Foxy puts it bandit hat at the ready ""And so it begins"" Sticklers will note a few variations from the novel. For instance 1) In the original Mrs. Fox was complicit all along. 2) Mr. Fox never went on the wagon. 3) Mr. and Mrs. Fox had four cubs not one little nutcase and Dahl made no mention of a yoga-bending super-nephew. 4) Im pretty sure the point of the story wasnt Mr. Foxs flagging self-esteem or his strained relationship with his son. But this is cinema in the time of Oprah when Reductio ad navelgazing is the inevitable narrative arc. And Anderson injects such charm and wit such personality and nostalgia -- evident in the old-school animation storybook settings and pitch-perfect use of Burl Ives -- that its easy to forgive his self-conscious touches. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals KitchenAid Small Kitchen Appliances at eBay Up to 51% off +...

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Tuesday Nov. 24 2009 225PM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 318PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Fantastic Mr. Fox Directed by Wes Anderson Written by Wes Anderson and Noah Baumbach Starring George Clooney and Meryl Streep Classification PG So very odd and yet familiar too the dysfunctional families in Wes Andersons films have always seemed to exist in a fractured fairy tale world a strange and funny and darkly whimsical place unrooted in time where adults never quite grow up but instead oscillate between endearing and reprehensible childish and childlike. Consequently its a natural fit for Anderson to adapt a childrens book especially one from Roald Dahl who like all the best writers for kids is himself a master of strange doings and an adroit blender of the bitter and the sweet. For all these reasons Fantastic Mr. Fox is a happy marriage of sensibilities yet make no mistake about who has the upper hand in this union. The tale may be Dahls but theres a whole new wag to it - this is decidedly weirdly and at best wonderfully a Wes Anderson movie. The distinction is rooted in two key decisions. The first was essential Given its short length the original story needed to be fleshed out to feature proportions. With an assist from his frequent co-writer Noah Baumbach heres where Anderson puts his stamp on the yarn - adding a few characters to the mix blacker shades to Mr. Foxs know-it-all personality and several layers of dysfunctional tension to his vulpine family. More about that later but now back to the second decision to use the stop-action method of animation an old-fashioned and labour-intensive technique that gives the picture an instantly classic look - yes unrooted in time. The new tone and the old look combine neatly right from the opening frame when to the strains of TheBallad of Davy Crockett  the thieving Mr. Fox and his young bride are on the hunt. Cocky to a fault he gets caught in a literal trap which then turns metaphoric when the missus announces ""Im pregnant."" Mere minutes in the ""king of the wild frontier"" has been busted to a vassal domesticated and tamed. Seven years later his fur confined in a corduroy jacket hes traded in thievery for journalism writing a newspaper column that nobody reads. Needless to say Mr. Fox aint happy - his soul has grown as moribund as his profession. No less surprising his wife is quite content in their shabby but secure foxhole. So the seeds of discord are sown and to nurture them the principal voices have been perfectly cast. As the frustrated male George Clooney is all roguish bluster and calculated charm keen to bust out of that corduroy and rediscover ""where his wild things are."" As the grounded female Meryl Streep is the vocal embodiment of maturity leaving the slyness to her prevaricating man and keeping the wisdom quietly to herself. Well mainly to herself. Once when the going gets especially tough she reveals with a candour both sweet and fatalistic ""I love you but I shouldnt have married you."" Only Anderson would stick such a heart-stopping line into a stop-action cartoon. As for that tough going it at least will be familiar to Dahl fans. Vowing to pull off ""one last big job"" Mr. Fox angers a trio of alliterative meanies the farmers Boggis Bunce and Bean who keep upping their retaliatory ante from shotguns to backhoes to dynamite. (The brutish humans here all have British accents while the cornered animals speak American - make of that what you will.) Anyway with a cinematic nod to The Great Escape  the chase is on as the foxes and other assorted critters tunnel down to escape the looming danger learning en route that an appreciation of their separate skills will promote their collective survival. At this point though the chase stalls a bit and so does the film. Even the narrative filler starts to thin out. For instance the script saddles Mr. Fox with a klutzy son (Jason Schwartzman) who in turn harbours a jealous resentment of his more physically gifted cousin (Eric Anderson). These additions work well at the outset. A curiously diffident overachiever the cousin is a quintessential Anderson figure and gives rise to a quintessential Anderson shot - the two rival kids late at night impassively watching a toy train clattering around its endlessly vicious circles. But by now the sons jealousy has been resolved as has the fathers frustration leaving the plot to plod towards happy-ending territory - a place that suits the original story just fine but seems ill at ease in this quirkier version. Thats not to deny the fun in the journey or Andersons own impeccable larceny in remaking Dahl in the directors image complete with his trademark array of slow tracking shots and symmetrical frames. Watch in particular for an eerie tableau that as the underground kingdom settles peacefully in appears startlingly above and out of the void an isolated wolf silhouetted black against a snowy vista so uncompromisingly wild yet so dreadfully alone.

Comments (4) click to enlarge Fantastic Mr. Fox Recommended Rated PG  88 minutes  2009 Tony hipster Wes Anderson (The Royal Tenenbaums) takes a left turn into stop-motion animation with this 2009 adaptation of the Roald Dahl childrens book and the result is an instant classic. The material allows Anderson to neutralize the most irritating aspects of his work (the precociousness the sense of white-bread privilege) and maximize the most endearing (the comic timing the dollhouse ordering of invented worlds). Like the rest of his movies this one is essentially infantile--but when youre telling the story of a neer-do-well fox conspiring against a trio of nasty farmers who cares? Noah Baumbach (The Squid and the Whale) collaborated with Anderson on the script; among the voice talents are Bill Murray Meryl Streep Michael Gambon Willem Dafoe and George Clooney perfect as the roguish hero.

Former Japanese consulate residence hits the Denver market for 4.2 million Sports Authority plans to pay top executives 2.85 million in bankruptcy bonuses Tennis-ball-sized hail knocks out 27 Colorado Springs police cars How fantastic is the lead of the delightful animated feature ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" really? Lets just say hes so comfy with himself he can pull off a brown corduroy suit. Were not sure the same could be said of the cool customer who voices Mr. Fox George Clooney. As fabulously cast as he is even he might have trouble with that brown ensemble. Yet there Mr. Fox stands eating an apple leaning against a tree pondering the nights raid on the chicken farmer Boggis. ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is yet another sign were living in an animation heyday. Director Wes Anderson brings his penchant for the whimsical to his first animated feature. This adaptaton of Roald Dahls chidrens book is a stop- motion wonder. The technique takes puppets moves them slightly shoots them moves them again shoots again. The illusion of motion is the sum of that painstaking labor. ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is resplendent with an autumnal palette of burnt oranges rich browns golds. It is delicate and vivid. The voices of Meryl Streep as Mrs. Fox; Bill Murray as Badger Mr. Foxs attorney; and Jason Schwartzman as the Foxes son make for a sly outing. But the film is honest in its treatment of feelings. The story opens with Mr. Fox making a promise to stop thieving. Its an oath he keeps for quite a while. The wee fox that was on the way when he made that pledge has grown into youngster Ash (Schwartzman). Alas Mr. Fox has become restless. His job as a newspaper columnist doesnt satisfy. And so Mr. Fox begins nightly raids on the farms of his old nemeses the farmers Boggis Bunce and Bean (Michael Gambon). He enlists Possum (Wally Wolodarky) as his accomplice. Meanwhile Ash gives in to the stuff of kid anxieties when his near-perfect cousin Kristofferson (Eric Anderson) arrives. Ash is jealous as Mr. Fox dotes on Kristofferson whos good at everything including the cricketlike sport Mr. Fox once excelled at in school. Owen Wilson is the voice of Coach Skip. Anderson and co-writer Noah Baumbach pen plenty of amusing lines about bullying wolves and hard cider. Though one of the funniest moments comes when Mr. Fox gets a talking to by the missus. This film is the handiwork of a gifted and idiosyncratic director. Anderson made ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and ""Rushmore."" Yet ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is his most accessible celebratory outing since ""Bottle Rocket"" his debut. The filmmakers hew to Dahls intent and add fine turns of their own. The ""terrible shovels"" and ""terrible tractors"" of the original remain. Employed by the infuriated farmers they rip holes in the earth and threaten the habitats of the Foxes. In an early fray Fox loses his tail in a fussilade. More than his vanity is wounded. A human wears it. A showdown looms. Still the tale isnt terribly frightening. Boggis Bunce and Bean arent pleasant examples of the species. Each is a glutton. Which makes stealing from them quite natural for a fox. There is mild naughtiness. Characters are constantly expressing sentiments that must be gussied up for tender ears. So they resort to phrases like ""What the cuss this"" ""What the cuss that."" Its clever.

Movie Information Fantastic Mr. FoxRatingShowtimes | Official site | TrailerDirector Wes AndersonActorsThe voices of George Clooney Meryl Streep Jason Schwartzman and Eric Chase AndersonRun time 86 minutesMPAA rating PG (action smoking and slang humor)SynopsisWes Anderson goes stop-motion with this Roald Dahl tale.More movies from GuideLive.comHis conundrum cunningly told should charm discerning kids and parents as director Wes Anderson brings Roald Dahls tale of a genial thief to the big screen.This first animation effort from Anderson best known for quirky comedies such as Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums takes on a lot one of Dahls least-known books and stop-motion animation an art form that involves exquisitely detailed miniatures moved and photographed in incremental movements that gave Tim Burtons The Nightmare Before Christmas such a memorable look.And with the help of a remarkable effects team and an A-list cast he pretty much pulls it off.George Clooney is all roguish charm as Mr. Fox summoning up memories of Oceans past with poultry replacing the lure riches had for his dapper Danny. Meryl Streep remarkably manages to mine emotional complexity as the long-suffering Mrs. Fox who thinks she has tamed him into settling down for a more respectable (ha) life as a journalist.True to Dahls slender book Mr. Fox cannot resist the challenge of stealing from the books fiendish fox-loathing farmers Bean Boggis and Bunce. At which point Andersons script co-written with Noah Baumbach starts rearranging the original plot and slipping in subplots that should be familiar to the writers fans Fox as a heedless father who tramples unthinkingly over the feelings of his son Ash (Jason Schwartzman); tortured peer rivalry as Ash keeps failing to measure up to the effortless excellence of his cousin Kristofferson (Andersons brother Eric Chase Anderson); a genial insensitive coach (Owen Wilson) who advises Ash not to aim too high because he probably wont make it.Some of Ashs angst may go on a bit too long for the kids. But those who liked Spike Jonzes tough take on Where the Wild Things Are should get a similar cathartic release with The Fantastic Mr. Fox. These films refuse to avoid or erase flaws. They accept them as part of who we are. After all the most fantastic thing about Mr. Fox is the way he shows that while our flaws can bring us down sometimes too we triumph in spite of them and because of them. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

With ""Pee-wees Big Adventure"" ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" he definitively proved that kiddie classics belong in the hands of hipster pop surrealists. Theyre in contact with the untrammeled animal impulses of youth and they see the world with kaleidoscope eyes yet they can put a sophisticated spin on fairy tales. (See also the Neil Gaiman/Henry Selick collaboration ""Coraline"" and Spike Jonzes ""Where the Wild Things Are."") The latest proof of this axiom is Wes Andersons madcap foray into stop-motion animation ""Fantastic Mr. Fox."" The film earns its titles superlative and a hundred more. Andersons outlandishly droll adaptation of Roald Dahls classic enables him to indulge his imagination beyond the boundaries of live-action film. He approaches this little epic of puppet theater with fastidious attention to visual detail. (If he hadnt turned to film Anderson could have been a breakout fashion designer or interior decorator.) Andersons great theme is tumultuous families and the Fox clan deliciously embodies his fixations. With co-writer Noah Baumbach (""The Squid and the Whale"") another indie connoisseur of family gamesmanship he bridges the worlds of children and adults in hilarious fashion. Its a feel-good romp for well-heeled neurotics. Mr. Fox is a sharp-dressing family man who is less grounded than he thinks he is. He has put aside the chicken-stealing antics of his youth married the lovely Felicity and sired young Ash. Feed Loader Associated Press - Ap In this film publicity image released by Fox Searchlight films the character Mr. Fox is shown in a scene from ""Fantastic Mr. Fox."" He writes the society column for the local newspaper frets about moving into a swankier part of the forest and blithely ignores his son a lump of sullen introversion. Hes entering a midlife crisis. ""Im seven in non-fox years"" he frets ""my father was dead at seven and a half."" He feels the need to pull ""one last job"" raiding the coops of nasty farmers Boggis Bunce and Bean. Felicity who made him promise years earlier to quit such risky behavior wont have it but the pull of his carnivorous nature cant be denied. Will he honor his promises and emotional commitments or go rogue? With George Clooneys raspy whiskey baritone voicing Mr. Fox its no surprise that the story melds ""Oceans Eleven"" heist action with the redemption of an aging reprobate. Mr. Fox is a con artist even with his family though the charge would surely wound him. Hes just being himself the classic narcissists get-out-of-jail-free card. When his dad takes an instant shine to visiting cousin Kristofferson a natural athlete and yoga sage Ash seethes with comic jealousy; his frozen yet fidgety annoyance is priceless. Anderson gets plenty of laughs out of his characters well-mannered repression. When Mr. Fox eats he becomes his true self tearing into his food like a chainsaw. An instant later hes the image of decorum. The eccentric characters are a delight and the giggles come flying at you like leaves in a tornado. Anderson paces the film like a Looney Tunes frolic on overdrive overstuffed with ingenious visual effects. The humor plays with our expectations and builds suspense. There are great surface laughs (electrified skeletons glowing like light-bulb filaments) and flashes of self-reflexive humor. Like all good kiddie characters Mr. Fox has a trademark shtick a fancy whistle of excitement. Here the other characters are aware of it and sort of jealous. The whiskery mannequins with their herky-jerky movements have a beguiling organic quality that is a welcome relief from the cold computer graphics of Disneys ""A Christmas Carol."" The dreamlike landscapes resemble opulent junior high school dioramas. ""Mr. Fox"" is a nonstop sight gag a handmade labor of love in an age of mass-produced uninspired entertainment.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + The wry stop-motion delight ""Fantastic Mr. Fox feels lovingly fussed over. With its papier-mache skies animal characters sporting glued-on tufts of fur landscapes that seem to be cobbled together from spit and plasticine its a defiantly handmade artifact - a tabletop movie.In other words its like every other Wes Anderson film (""Rushmore ""The Royal Tenenbaums ""The Darjeeling Limited) just without the pesky actors. This turns out to be critical. By forgoing actual human beings the director has made his most charming least annoyingly fey film - a thing of lovely comic wisdom. Other filmmakers turn to childrens stories when they have kids of their own. Anderson seems to have made this one for his inner child.The movie has been adapted by Anderson and Noah Baumbach (writer-director of ""The Squid and the Whale) from the 1970 kids book by Roald Dahl. It jettisons Dahls coolly subversive tone as well as large chunks of plot to make room for Andersons (and Baumbachs) usual obsessions feckless parents hesitant kids the endless family struggle between the ones who take and the ones who get took.George Clooney exudes slippery vocal charm as Mr. Fox a natty former carnivore turned newspaper columnist () who tries to solve his midlife crisis with a raid on the three meanest farmers in the land. Meryl Streep plays Mrs. Fox anxious when things are calm calm in times of crisis. Anderson regular Jason Schwartzman is their misfit son Ash glowering with resentment over a father who hogs the spotlight.Bill Murray provides the voice of a badger attorney Owen Wilson a rabbity coach. Willem Dafoe? A rat of course. Hearing these familiar voices issuing from the bristling bustling animal forms is one of the daft pleasures of ""Fantastic Mr. Fox which at times feels closer to Kenneth Grahames beloved ""The Wind in the Willows than Dahl. Like Grahame Anderson doesnt humanize animals so much as animalize humans holding on to our joys and doubts hopes and delusions the small daily lies we tell each other and ourselves.So Mr. Fox hits the henhouses and storerooms of farmers Boggis Bunce and Bean - Michael Gambon gives amusingly splenetic voice to the latter a rawboned country sharpie - because it makes him feel young again no longer tied to a desk job and a mortgage on a tree. The adventure blows up in his face obviously and an early casualty is Foxs fine red tail shot off and turned into Beans necktie. ""Fantastic Mr. Fox goes further though and traces the consequences of one creatures middle-aged folly until it ensnares the entire forest ecosystem and theres nowhere to dig but down sideways and hopefully up.Is this really a family film? No more or less so than ""The Incredibles which covered similar psychic turf in a more exuberant less eccentric fashion. Actually ""Fantastic Mr. Fox rescues the very phrase ""family film from an industrial entertainment complex that has warped it beyond all recognition. Anderson deals with generational dynamics - a dad who needs to be forever young a son looking for the best way to grow up - in a way everyone can access from kids to grandparents. The movie isnt funny ha-ha but funny-beguiling and I think most children will be puzzled and fascinated with it the way you can be taken with something weird but true.Which is to say that Andersons whimsies work better in this context - with more wit and playful warmth - than in his ostensibly grown-up movies. Its the small funky details of ""Mr. Fox that stick with you The way Kylie the Possum (Wally Wolodarsky) has eyes that turn into spiral buttons whenever he spaces out the mole that plays Art Tatum piano riffs the single word ""cuss that the animals use as an all-purpose expletive or the way these civilized beasts sit down to meals and rip into them like temporary carnivores.Theres the moral if youre looking for one. Why do we do the stupid things we do? Because were wild animals pretending to be grown-ups and grown-ups betrayed by our wildness. (""I used to steal birds but now Im a newspaperman sighs Mr. Fox and brother I hear you.) This is a little further up the evolutionary and maturity ladder than say a Wild Thing but still not far enough to keep us out of trouble. ""Fantastic Mr. Fox is a fairy tale for adults thats gracious enough to let everyone play along.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation.

(out of four)PG  128  Contains some mild peril JOE WILLIAMS Nov 26 2009 (...) Before he focused on ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" no one would have expected a kids movie from Wes Anderson (""Rushmore"" ""The Royal Tenenbaums""). And as with Spike Jonze (""Where the Wild Things Are"") he didnt give us one.Although its adapted from a fable by Roald Dahl (""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"") this animated marvel is unmistakably a Wes Anderson film. Its got the neurotic characters kitsch soundtrack and symmetrical compositions wed expect from a director who seems to have been weaned on The New Yorker circa 1964. Thats the year that American kids were gifted with the Christmas special ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer."" ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" has a similar stop-motion style with furry creatures facing abominable threats. But the season it evokes is the harvest. Theres a golden glow across the English countryside and Mr. Fox (voice of George Clooney) is hungering for poultry. Fox was busted for a previous raid on a hen house and hed promised his wife (Meryl Streep) that hed go straight and raise their son Ash (Jason Schwartzman) on his salary as a newspaper columnist. But Fox knows in his heart that hes a wild animal and hes got his sights set on the nearby chicken farms of short Mr. Boggis fat Mr. Bunce and lean Mr. Bean. But after the wily Fox his near-sighted partner Possum (Wally Wolodarsky) and his daring nephew Kristofferson (Eric Anderson) blunder into the humans trap mean Mr. Bean (Michael Gambon) sends a tractor brigade to wage war on the entire community of underground mammals.With the director and star spoofing the ""Oceans"" movies this is a frisky caper but it also has elements of a marital drama as his wife regrets the day she married the felonious Fox and a teen comedy as Ash fumes over the popularity of his athletic cousin Kristofferson. Most of all its a magical feat one that turns puppets into personalities and an English meadow into Andersons world.

Opening with a shot of Mr. Fox on a hill beneath a great tree listening to ""The Ballad of Davy Crockett"" on his Walk Sonic (the Walkman of the fox world) as he waits for his lovely wife to appear the film ranges over a wide swath of English farmland and country villages. Its hero is voiced by George Clooney - a fitting choice because like the stars Danny Ocean ""Foxy"" is a bit of a bounder a restless soul that needs a caper a heist to let him know hes alive. Its in his blood.In fact the voice work is universally stellar Meryl Streep as Mrs. Fox a patient (to a point) and perceptive spouse who speaks her mind and paints striking though troubling landscapes; Jason Schwartzman as Ash the Foxes sulky son; Eric Anderson (Wes brother) as the visiting cousin Kristofferson whose athleticism and good looks pose a threat to Ash. And Bill Murray as Badger a financial adviser getting into a ""cussin "" match with Fox over the viability of a piece of real estate.Fantastic Mr. Fox presents a sublime example of what can be done with this painstaking old-school form of animation (the same technique that brought the original King Kong to life and that keeps the British duo Wallace and Gromit going). The beautiful anthropomorphic animal puppets - and a trio of menacing human puppets too (Foxs arch-enemies the farmers Boggis Bunce and Bean) - inhabit a whimsical diorama of old-fashioned cars motorbikes and domestic accoutrements. The film has a three-dimensional quality a sense of movement and depth thats at once wholly artificial and wholly inviting.But Fantastic Mr. Fox is more than just a terrific kid flick a whimsical fable brought to life. Fox wrestles with existential dilemmas. ""Who am I?"" he mulls. And why is he here? Fox is struggling to reconcile his wild animal nature his innate restlessness with the refined pleasures of life - the companionship of loved ones the coziness of a warm home the satisfaction to be gleaned from a book or a song (Burl Ives anyone?).And speaking of satisfaction and song Anderson spins the Rolling Stones ""Street Fighting Man"" at the perfect and perfectly unexpected moment. Mixing vintage tunes by the cider-throated Ives with the Beach Boys Jarvis Cocker the jazz of Art Tatum and Alexandre Desplats stately orchestral passages the soundtrack of Fantastic Mr. Fox is itself a quirky little gem.In its swift sublime 87 minutes Anderson and his cowriter Noah Baumbach (Margot at the Wedding) have taken the gist of Dahls slim volume and expanded it into a sometimes funny occasionally scary always enchanting adventure that really when you come down to it is about the challenges all of us face in life.We might not have to extricate ourselves from an animal trap or lace a blueberry with sleeping powder to deal with a menacing hound dog but theres still plenty to relate to here. Fantastic Mr. Fox is beyond fantastic - its the best animated film of the year and maybe the best cussin film period.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

"Fantastic Mr. Fox | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; fantastic-mr-fox ) Fantastic Mr. Fox (United States 2009) November 23 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli While it might be a stretch to claim that Fantastic Mr. Fox is ""fantastic"" its easily among the years best animated features. If theres an argument against the film (and admittedly its not much of an argument) its that the movie may not be suitably childish to appeal to younger viewers. The screenplay adapted from the novel by Roald Dahl is too literate to hold the attention of the littlest ones. Fantastic Mr. Fox which lacks the kind of hyperkinetic action scenes that resemble video game extracts seems to have been designed more with adults and mature kids in mind. Plus while the old school stop-motion animation is beautiful in its own way some viewers will find it primitive in comparison with the slickness that can be achieved with the computer generated variety. Mr. Fox (voice of George Clooney) an animal of the expected species is an ex-thief who now earns his living as a newspaper columnist. Bored with living in a hole he decides to buy a house in a tree and moves in with his wife Felicity (Meryl Streep) and son Ash (Jason Schwartzman). They are soon joined by Mr. Foxs nephew Kristofferson (Eric Anderson) who is staying with them while his father recuperates from double pneumonia. The tree house is close to the farms of Boggis Bunce and Bean and the lure of easy loot proves too tempting for Mr. Fox to ignore despite a two-year old promise to his wife never to steal again. So with his faithful sidekick Kylie the opossum (Wally Wolodarsky) in tow he sets out to steal chickens from Boggis ducks and geese from Bunce and alcoholic cider from Bean. He succeeds but the farmers arent happy and decide to use every means at their disposal to remove the blight of Mr. Fox from their little corner of the world. Andersons adaptation of the Dahl novel is so smooth and effortless that Im tempted to say he has unearthed his calling. For the most part I have found his live-action films (which are generally much beloved by critics) to be intelligent-yet-pompous (consider for example The Darjeeling Limited) but Fantastic Mr. Fox perhaps because it is envisioned as being family-friendly is just plain smart. For the most part Anderson keeps his proclivity for pretentiousness in check although there are times when the assembled animals sound like lost members of The Royal Tenenbaums. The humor is often subtle but that doesnt rob it of its ability to provoke smiles and laughter. And the animated nature of the production robs some of the more mean-spirited elements of their sting. Fantastic Mr. Fox may not get PETAs stamp of approval (some birds meet gruesome fates) but the MPAA saw it as worthy of nothing more restrictive than a mild PG. Dahl purists may complain that the movie doesnt end the same way the book does but Anderson and co-writer Noah Baumbach reportedly uncovered an alternative ending devised by Dahl that didnt make it into print and this was used to inform the conclusion. Whether or not this is true the pieces of the movie that do not replicate aspects of the novel are nevertheless faithful to the spirit of the source material. Id place this alongside Matilda as a motion picture that ""gets"" the book and transforms its essence to the screen. The voice work is superlative. George Clooney brings the right mix of bravado and self-deprecation to the part of Mr. Fox. Often using an immediately recognizable voice for an animated character can be a problem but Clooney is so charismatic that he manages to overcome the hurdle. Meryl Streep who has been branching into new areas recently (first Mamma Mia now this) is effectively subtle. Anderson ""regulars"" Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray (possibly atoning for Garfield) provide support as does Willem Dafoe as the dastardly Rat who seems to have learned his moves from watching West Side Story a few too many times. Michael Gambon uses his rumbling bass to good effect as the dastardly Bean. So this is life after Dumbledore... Its a curious fact that most films based on Dahl stories have become more highly regarded with the passage of time than they are when released. This has been the case with Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (although not necessarily the Tim Burton re-telling of the story) James and the Giant Peach and Matilda. Henry Selick clearly has a love for Dahl. He was the director of James and the Giant Peach and was originally attached with Anderson for this film (he left to helm Coraline). Anderson has proceeded as Selick might have and the stop-motion style is in keeping with what Selick would likely have achieved. (The group of animators were the same.) In addition to recalling James and the Giant Peach Fantastic Mr. Fox reminded me of the Aardman movies especially Chicken Run. Not only is the ""look"" similar but the philosophy of voice characterization is the same (with the unmistakable vocal stylings of Mel Gibson front-and-center). Both films also boast screenplays whose sophistication belies their format. Are there kids who will enjoy the hell out of Fantastic Mr. Fox? Sure. But I suspect that in many cases this is one animated offering where the parents will get more out of it than their offspring.

(Courtesy of Fox Searchlight) So many careful and clever visual felicities  dot the landscape of Wes Andersons animated feature ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" from the catastrophically inclined watercolors painted by Mrs. Fox to the autumn breezes ruffling various species of animals fur just so Im flummoxed as to why the movie left me feeling up in the air as opposed to over the moon. Partly I think its a matter of how Andersons sense of humor rubs up against that of the books author Roald Dahl. Its also a matter of how the fox at the center has been altered from a roguish but essentially heroic savior (in the 1970 original) to a more arrogant wiseacre as voiced by George Clooney. The foxs exploits are depicted as chapters of a rollicking life often witty but a little underpowered in its narrative. I have no idea how kids will respond to that narrative. And I realize as I type this that many of the charges leveled against Spike Jonzes ""Where the Wild Things Are"" though not by me point to what I resist about ""Fantastic Mr. Fox."" This is an experiment worth debating because its the work of a filmmaker worth debating and while his latest is a foray into proudly old-school stop-motion animation it is an Anderson film through and through. When a newly invented character insecure young Ash Fox (voiced by Jason Schwartzman) bickers or rather mutter-bickers with his high school science lab partners its like a vulpine outtake from ""Rushmore"" the 1998 Anderson comedy in which Schwartzman took the leading role. When Mrs. Fox voiced by Meryl Streep casually drops the news that shes pregnant Mr. Fox -- who has been struggling to leave his chicken-stealing ways behind and make peace with his ""respectable"" job as a newspaper columnist -- is left momentarily speechless a frozen tooth-baring smile plastered on his furry face. Anderson frames this reaction shot in his trademark head-on deliberately stiff fashion at once deadpan and wryly heightened for effect. Dahls story was suspenseful simplicity itself Fox and family and friends in a life-and-death battle with the farmers whose poultry and foodstuffs have been pilfered regularly by the animals. The war gets pretty grim; the foxes and their comrades are driven underground and to desperate measures. The screenplay by Anderson and co-writer Noah Baumbach creates a new set of complications for this framework. Son Ashs rivalry with a visiting cousin Kristofferson (Eric Anderson) underscores the theme of familial strife no Anderson picture is ever without. Mr. Fox betrays his wife in sneaking off for ""one last big job on the sly."" These are promising starting points and the craftsmanship is impeccable. Animation director Mark Gustafson cinematographer Tristan Oliver and production designer Nelson Lowry conspire to create a bucolic dream life threatened by the venal farmers (Michael Gambon voices the baddest of the trio Mr. Bean). No less so than Andersons previous film ""The Darjeeling Limited"" ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" establishes a hermetic slightly suffocating comic universe and populates it with characters trying to find their place in that world or an escape route out of it. The voice work like the voice work in ""Where the Wild Things Are"" exists in a realm of throwaway naturalism. No ""cartoon"" delivery here. The film would rather be caught dead than caught dumbing down for kids though with its aggravating interpolation of the Beach Boys ""I Get Around"" Anderson manages to dumb down with an overexposed tune every which way. (The orchestral bits are by composer Alexandre Desplat one of the best working today.) If only Mr. Fox were a more interesting character Then I think the storys resolution would be more than merely quaint. Clooneys amusing in motormouth mode but Anderson and Baumbach fail to make Foxys glibness much fun. The self-knowing irony seems ill-suited to Dahls traditional story interests. Many disagree; the film has plenty of ardent admirers. I will revisit it sometime. For now though I rank it roughly alongside Andersons ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" -- lower than the great ""Rushmore"" higher than ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"" -- in its slightly twisted formalism and sporadic occasionally inspired comic returns.

This movie was so different and appealing to my own nostalgia that my wife and I havent stopped talking about it since last night. I found the dialogue clever and quotable and all the characters to be very enjoyable with their patented ""Wes Anderson Here are 3 particular things about this character to hold dear"". Just enjoy it Michael. Posted by John | December 12 2009 at 1107 AM Often I find I come to the same opinion about Wes Anderson films. I love the way they look I love their soundtracks and I love the acting in them. Its all very stylish. Its the scripts that Im less then enthusiastic about. Yet despite that I occasionally find myself in the mood for a Wes Anderson film and I always enjoy it better on a second viewing so they must be doing something right. I think I just have to be in the right mood. That makes Mr. Fox a rental for me.

Fantastic Mr. Fox Good to great Director Wes Anderson. Cast George Clooney Meryl Streep Bill Murray. Rating Rated PG for action smoking and slang humor. RELATED Goodykoontz on holiday films Wes Anderson meets Roald Dahl in Fantastic Mr. Fox Spotlight George Clooney Spotlight Meryl Streep Spotlight Bill Murray Stop-motion animation in film Whether its the perfect kids movie for kids is a more complex question but any parent who has endured repeat DVD viewings of ""Barbie Fairytopia"" will leave the theater giddy with delight. And once the DVD comes out itll likely be the parents hitting the ""repeat"" button on the DVD player. Director Wes Anderson the man behind such quirky delights as ""Rushmore"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" manages to bring his signature offbeat voice to Roald Dahls book (Anderson and Noah Baumbach co-wrote the expanded screenplay). Notably at a time when smoothly animated 3-D is all the rage Anderson uses stop-motion animation making ""Mr. Fox"" feel simultaneously both old-school and fresh. George Clooney a great choice to play a loveable rogue gives voice to the title character. Hes a bird thief gone straight - or at least as straight as a job as a newspaper columnist makes you. But while Mrs. Fox (Meryl Streep) has happily settled into married life and motherhood Mr. Fox finds the button-down life constraining. So he decides to raid the three farms he can see from the window of his familys new home in a tree despite having promised Mrs. Fox years before that hed give up the thieving life (a promise that leads to one of the best lines of the year ""I used to steal birds but now Im a newspaper man""). Focused as he is on stealing from the loathsome farmers Mr. Fox ignores his son Ash (Jason Schwartzman) an odd kid who struggles to live up to his fathers legacy as a great school athlete. Mr. Fox does however have designs on using the athletic talents of his nephew Kristofferson (Eric Anderson) to aid him in his schemes. Of course with the kitchen pantry becoming increasingly stuffed with the spoils of Mr. Foxs nighttime exploits its hard to hide the truth from Mrs. Fox. How could he break his promise? Well Mr. Fox says with a shrug hes a wild animal. Shes not particularly impressed with his self-awareness. Things go south not just for the Foxes but for all their friends as the farmers are not ones to sit idly by and let their products be stolen. Its up to Mr. Fox to fix things which only seems right as hes the one who caused all the trouble in the first place. ""Mr. Fox"" jumps around a bit in tone and pace (accentuated by the stop-motion animation). But its pieces ultimately fit together telling a sweet family story in a most unconventional way. Along the way were treated to excellent vocal performances from the likes of Bill Murray as Badger (a lawyer naturally); Willem Dafoe as Rat who has sold out to the Man (fitting); and Wallace Wolodarsky as the easily distracted yet loyal Kylie. Anderson himself gets into the act as Weasel who is in a nice bit of scripting a Realtor. Is that the kind of joke kids will get? Probably not. They might not grasp how fitting the use of the Rolling Stones ""Street Fighting Man"" is in a later scene either. And frankly I didnt care. There is plenty of action for them here in other places sight gags and pratfalls. Whats so good about ""Mr. Fox"" is that even if it rates as only a serviceable kid film (and savvy children will see it as more than that) its a genuine entertainment for adults as well.

His debut film Bottle Rocket (1996) starring his goofily charming friends the Wilson brothers won him early cult status. Rushmore was built on a witty and distinctive voice and Andersons visual brilliance came into sharp focus with The Royal Tenenbaums an elaborately wrapped present to a generation that wanted its own J.D. Salinger one without the hermit-like lifestyle and creepy Joyce Maynard baggage. (See the Top 10 Troubled Genius films.) But Anderson proved easy to fall out of love with as well as his subsequent movies became bogged down by a tendency to revisit the same themes -- broken families in need of healing -- and control issues that were outsize even for a filmmaker. With The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou there was the sense of being sucked into a rabbit hole dug by Anderson and by the cloying The Darjeeling Limited his self-indulgence had swollen to the point where the hole was too claustrophobic for any but his most devoted fans to bear. One would think then that a trip with him down an actual hole albeit one dug by a family of foxes might be pure torture. But Andersons stop-motion Fantastic Mr. Fox is both a delightful amusement and a distillation of the filmmakers essential playfulness. Its not quite tongue-in-cheek but very self-aware in a good way. ""Why yes"" Anderson seems to be telling us. ""I do like to play with dollhouses. And look what I can do with them. See the way Mr. Foxs fur stirs in the nonexistent breeze isnt that marvelous?"" It is even if its different from Roald Dahls childrens story about a fox clever enough to outwit three mean farmers named Boggis Bunce and Bean one fat one short one lean (no one can say that just once). Dahls spirit is there but the cinematic Fantastic Mr. Fox comes fortified with Andersonian pouting parental issues self doubt and philosophical conundrums. ""Who am I Kylie?"" Mr. Fox (voiced by George Clooney) muses to the sidekick Anderson has created for him an opossum voiced by Wally Wolodarksy -- then clarifies ""Im saying this as an existential question."" (Read about this falls Clooney film trifecta.) The question arises because Mr. Fox who it must be noted wears slightly too tight too short suits made of corduroy or tweed just like his director is feeling stymied. In a prologue set two years before our story begins (thats 12 fox years) Mrs. Fox (Meryl Streep) announces shes pregnant and forces him to give up fowl thievery for a safer profession. Now hes a newspaper columnist (which hardly qualifies as safer) but he longs to return to the hunt specifically to Boggis Bunce and Beans farms all of which are laid out in glorious tempting symmetry just across from the front door of the Foxs ""finest quality indigenous"" old-growth tree house. Dahls Mr. Fox is cocky and clever although maybe not as clever as he makes himself out to be. Andersons Mr. Fox is the same but more so. Hes like a mid-career tribute to Clooney bold charming but naughty dependent on his smile but well aware of that. And because of his urges -- ""Im a wild animal"" he reminds Mrs. Fox -- hes not altogether trustworthy which seems like a nod to a reputation that Clooney happily feeds every time he parades a fresh piece of arm candy about the red carpet. Seven-year-olds may be oblivious to the meta-Clooney but their mothers will certainly get a kick out of him. (See ""George Clooney The Last Movie Star."") Thats not the only inside joke likely to go over the heads of small Fox fans. Badger (Bill Murray) is no longer just a neighbor but a lawyer who gives advice on mortgages. Mrs. Fox so sweetly supportive of her partner in the book -- it is she who dubs him ""fantastic"" -- is now a dubious sort who limits all praise and wields a sharp claw. Mother to four in Dahls story here she has only one kit Ash (Jason Schwartzman) who is petulant undersized uncoordinated and insecure. ""Youre supposed to be my lab partner"" he says to a comely young fox named Agnes who is distracted in their biology class by the Foxes glamorous houseguest Ashs cousin Kristofferson (voiced by Andersons brother Eric). ""I am"" Agnes protests. ""No youre not"" he scolds. ""Youre disloyal."" Its a hilarious moment but perhaps only if youre familiar with the crew of other insecure brats Schwartzman has played for Anderson. But there is also much humor in the purer simpler Wallace and Gromit vein as well enough to bewitch the youthful members of the audience. The foxes are entirely civilized until it comes to meals; then they gobble feverishly and without restraint. Kylie is a loyal sidekick but not the brightest opossum in all the land; when confused his eyes transform into dazed little bulls eyes. A beagle with a case of ""chronic rabies"" is used to great effect and Boggis (Robin Hurlstone) Bunce (Hugo Guinness) and Bean (Michael Gambon) are brilliantly realized. Stop-motion is clearly a laborious business but what shows in Andersons film is not the work but the joy derived from a craft used to maximum effect. If Fox Searchlight wanted to double its box office they need only set up a booth selling models of Andersons Fox family right outside the door of the theaters; theyre as appealing as any stuffed toy Steiff has ever made. As for Mr. Anderson he like Mr. Fox has dug himself out a hole by going deeper into it. Fantastic. See TIMEs Pictures of the Week.

Instead this film manages to capture all the joy of childish delights with grown-up irony and humor making it pure fun. Visually its a true marvel. Perhaps best of all it feels like something entirely new. George Clooney is the voice of Mr. Fox an elegant chicken-stealer who favors not-quite-long-enough-sleeved suits (just like his creator). Fox is a little bit Danny Ocean mixed with Out of Sight schemer Jack Foley dotted with all the finger-snapped suavity of the actor himself. When his wife (Meryl Streep) tells him they are expecting a cub he swears to go straight and becomes a newspaper columnist instead. Yet the highs and profit from such work cant compare to the thrill and reward of his former dangerous life and Foxy cant resist the lure of one last heist involving the three meanest farmers around. He enlists a new pal a possum named Kylie (Wallace Wolodarsky) and his nephew the naturally athletic Ash (Eric Anderson Mr. Andersons brother and creative collaborator) while trying not to hurt the feelings of his ""different"" son (a pitch-perfect Jason Schwartzman). The movie co-written by Mr. Anderson and Noah Baumbach takes some necessary departures and adds in a few subplots but overall it enhances the story. The stop-motion animation that Mr. Anderson employs so different from the depersonalized ultra-smooth perfect Pixar look only adds to the richness of the film. The animals--which include rabbits badgers (hooray for Bill Murray) moles (The Observers James Hamilton) hounds and a hilarious turn by Willem Dafoe as a vaguely Frenchy delusional rat--all have fur that bristles and whiskers that twitch. In fact some of the movies best moments are when these animals break from their civilized affairs and remember that they are indeed just wild animals. As with all of Mr. Andersons movies Fantastic Mr. Fox is sweetly wry with comedic surprises and arch dialogue--I dont know how much the kids will get out of the witticisms but their parents will certainly be laughing. svilkomersonobserver.com Comment Filed under Bill Murray George Clooney Jason Schwartzman Meryl Streep Movie Review Wes Anderson Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics The (Real) Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia Origin Story Culture Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture Breaking Miamis Wynwood Arts District Is a Hotbed for Zika Politics Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://www.observer.com/2009/culture/anderson-makes-fantastic-fox?page=all,200,fantasticmr.fox21,fantasticmr.fox,observer

BOTTOM LINE A real winner with enough charm and wit for kids and parents alike. CAST George Clooney Meryl Streep Jason Schwartzman Bill Murray LENGTH 128 Children some of the most savvy moviegoers around lately have been misunderstood by the major studios. Judging by box-office returns they didnt want the constant emotional pain of ""Where the Wild Things Are"" or the apocalyptic nightmare of ""9."" Much like adults children want to see the whole of life onscreen - dark and light sorrow and humor rage and tenderness. Theyll find all that in ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" a stop-motion animated feature from director Wes Anderson (""The Royal Tenenbaums""). It opens todayFriday in Manhattan but is scheduled for wider release Nov. 25 so mark your calendars This charming inventive slyly hilarious and sneakily profound movie is one of the years best by any standard. It retains the basics of Roald Dahls short novel in which the cocky chicken thief Mr. Fox (George Clooney born for the role) steals from the villainous Farmer Bean (Michael Gambon) and endangers his whole family. But Anderson and his co-writer Noah Baumbach (""The Squid and the Whale"") add new layers to the story creating a full-fledged comedy-drama. advertisement | advertise on newsday This Fox also feels trapped by a wife (Meryl Streep) a young son (Jason Schwartzman) and a hefty mortgage (his real-estate agent is of course a weasel). Foxs struggle to tame his wild nature is poignant; its not just his ruffled fur and dancing eyes that make this character feel so real. With its clever visual jokes and sassy dialogue Andersons first foray into animation doesnt seem to be made entirely with children in mind. Maybe thats why it seems so perfect for them.

ABOUT THE FILMFantastic Mr. Fox    (out of four) Voices George Clooney Meryl Streep Jason Schwartzman Bill MurrayDirector Wes AndersonDistributor Fox SearchlightRating PG for action smoking and slang humorRunning time 1 hour 27 minutesOpens today in select cities By Claudia Puig USA TODAY In his first foray into animation director Wes Anderson lends his trademark quirky humor to a childrens tale rendering it a sometimes witty if odd cartoon for all ages. Fantastic Mr. Fox imaginatively re-works Roald Dahls 1970 storybook into a zippy stop-motion adventure with top-notch voice talent and an appealing-looking gaggle of furry creatures. While much of it is entrancing and the tone is endearingly peppy the humor is uneven and the tale grows repetitive. Its an intriguing match of material and filmmaker. Dahls distinctive edgy storytelling seems to fit well with Andersons idiosyncratic worldview and visuals. The world in Fantastic Mr. Fox looks cozy and pleasant but theres malevolence lurking. The films theme centers on growing up having a family resisting becoming tame and retaining a sense of spirit. Mr. Fox (George Clooney) is a likable former bandit. Mrs. Fox (Meryl Streep) is equally clever. But she has tamed her wild nature since the birth of her son Ash (Jason Schwartzman). Still a risk-taker at heart Mr. Fox endures the life domestic. He owns a house and has a job writing a newspaper column but he hatches a plot to raid three despicable farmers throwing everyone into a tizzy. Meanwhile Mr. Fox dismisses Ashs efforts to impress him and instead admires the athletic prowess of a cousin Kristofferson (Eric Anderson). Family attention and approval is lightly raised here. Prolonged chases and fights are among the least intriguing scenes. Willem Dafoe voices a villainous rat and Bill Murray lends humor to his Badger character. Clooneys low-key comic timing contrasts with his frenzied bursts of animal behavior. These weirdly effective shifts in tempo combined with an attention to detail and distinctive dialogue make for the best moments in this offbeat adventure.

This oafish epic about the End of Days--as predicted by the Mayan calendar--operates in a dead zone roughly equidistant between parody and idiocy. You do get the connection between tongue and cheek but much of the humor still goes thud. A few action sequences rise to the challenge of the subject but many of the digital effects look murky and the cumulative effect is numbness. The only character with genuine if grotesque energy is Charlie Frost a crackpot prophet conspiracy theorist and pirate radio broadcaster played by Woody Harrelson; he provides a few jolts of Rapture schlock before the movie turns into destructo drek. For better or (mainly) worse Mr. Emmerich is up to his old tricks. In ""Independence Day"" he tested our mettle with marauding aliens. In ""The Day After Tomorrow"" he unleashed global warming that precipitated global freezing. This time his cosmic weapon of choice is a beam of mutant neutrinos that emanates from the sun and by heating the earths core destabilizes tectonic plates defeats coherence (though the huge disjointed production might have been conceived as a study in chaos theory) and degrades dialogue. (""An unprecedented international venture is under way"" the American president tells his daughter during an intimate conversation couched in the near-English favored by Emmerich films.) ENLARGE A scene from 2012 Columbia Pictures The international venture involves building what Charlie suspects to be a fleet of space ships that will save the rich and powerful before our planet goes the way of Krypton; to get a seat the wild-eyed geezer says ""youd have to be Bill Gates or Rupert Murdoch or some Russian billionaire."" (Of the three only a particularly obnoxious Russian billionaire has a confirmed reservation.) Since the White House has kept a lid of secrecy on the existence of the ships--which arent really what Charlie suspects--it falls to the presidents chief science advisor Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) to uncover the truth. Once he does however Adrian like his boss seems blithely indifferent to the ventures ethical aspects which arent debated until the movies climax. (The president finally wonders aloud if seats on the ships should have been offered in a lottery. That sounds like a plan except for leaving six or seven billion passengers wait-listed.) ENLARGE John Cusack catches a plane in 2012. Columbia Pictures The script is so scatterbrained that no one ever seems to understand anything in real time; its as if all reactions are on 30-minute delay. (The running time is 158 minutes.) Whats more ""2012"" has no discernible attitude toward the end of civilization apart from the belief that theres a movie in it. The cast includes John Cusack as Jackson Curtis a sci-fi novelist turned limo driver; Amanda Peet as Jacksons ex-wife Kate; Danny Glover as the president; Thandie Newton as his daughter; and Oliver Platt as the presidents steely chief of staff. Among the points of interest either damaged disturbed or destroyed are Las Vegas the Vatican the Himalayas the South Pole (relocated to Wisconsin) the Washington Monument much of Wyoming and all of California. For once Manhattan meets its fate offstage. Pirate Radio ""Pirate Radio"" follows the form--when it chooses to follow any form--of a cat-and-mouse game between the British government circa 1966 and a crew of raffish DJs beaming round-the-clock rock n roll from a decrepit tanker anchored in the North Sea just outside Albions territorial waters. Whitehall in the person of a puritanical government minister played by Kenneth Branagh views the ship and its transmissions as ""a sewer."" The ships captain and station owner a spacey dandy played by Bill Nighy sees his vessel as an island of anarchy in a sea of conformity. (At the time BBC radio barely acknowledged rocks existence.) Richard Curtiss comedy is anchored only in exuberance but thats more than you can say for most movies these days; it keeps you beaming with pleasure. ENLARGE Tom Sturridge looks on as Rhys Ifans handles the mic in Pirate Radio. Focus Features Mr. Curtis first made his mark in feature films as the writer of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""Notting Hill."" Until now his only experience as a big-screen filmmaker was as the writer-director of ""Love Actually"" a mixed bag of romantic notions in which Hugh Grant played a British prime minister and Mr. Nighy was an aging drug-addled rock star. ""Pirate Radio"" (which was originally called ""The Boat That Rocked"") is another mixed bag if truth be told. The writing can get fairly ragged in between the many felicities. The direction recalls but seldom approaches the elegant anarchy of Richard Lesters Beatles films. Some comic bits work beautifully--Im partial to a silent buddy-bonding scene involving cookies and a glass of coffee--while others work haltingly or not at all. Yet the movies flaws matter little when theyre measured against its marvelous music terrific performances and vivid sense of place at a special time--not just a rust bucket in the North Sea but Great Britain two decades after the devastation of World War II in the throes of a pop-cultural revolution. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays a DJ called The Count; his work is as always an amalgam of the mysteriously laconic and the enjoyably histrionic. Other members of the fine cast are Rhys Ifans Nick Frost Tom Sturridge Rhys Darby Talulah Riley and January Jones as well as Emma Thompson in a cheery cameo. And a looseness of form doesnt exclude a profusion of events or a panoply of borrowings from ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" through ""Mamma Mia"" and ""Titanic"" to the civilian flotilla of rescue vessels at Dunkirk. ""Pirate Radio"" takes freely and gives generously. Fantastic Mr. Fox Life is full of surprises. The best one Ive had in a good while is ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" Wes Andersons stop-action animated version of the classic childrens novel by Roald Dahl. Who could have guessed--certainly not me--that animation and Mr. Anderson most recently the director of ""The Darjeeling Limited"" would be an inspired and mutually inspiring match? Instead of the vapid motion-capture process of ""A Christmas Carol"" he and his collaborators give us a captivating entertainment for the holiday season and well beyond. ENLARGE Mr. Fox voiced by George Clooney aims to live up to his adjective in Fantastic Mr. Fox. Fox Searchlight Pictures The script which the director wrote with Noah Baumbach takes elaborate liberties with its source material. Now the bane of three farmers existence is a bushy-tailed newspaper columnist voiced by George Clooney. (His wife voiced by Meryl Streep had been urging him to stop stealing birds and find a new line of work.) If that sounds precious or improbable--a wild animal hasnt written a newspaper column since the days of Jimmy Breslin--the film is all of that and more the more being foxily funny. The visual style is a radical departure from the original Quentin Blake illustrations but a hugely endearing one thats rendered in exotic colors stuffed with more details than a Richard Scarry page and popping with zestful inventions. So whos the films audience? The voice cast alone should be a draw for adults--not just Mr. Clooney who gives a commanding (no kidding) comic performance but Ms. Streep Bill Murray Michael Gambon Willem Dafoe Jason Schwartzman Owen Wilson; theyre all delightful in their respective ways. And the look of the film should enchant kids who may be too young to savor the sophisticated script. All I can say for certain is that I didnt expect to be the audience for this lovely oddity but I was. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD FOCUS ENLARGE Still Crazy ( 1998) Bill Nighy has made a specialty of playing drugged-out rockers; its a dubious niche that he occupies with rare distinction. In this comedy directed by Brian Gibson he is Ray the former lead singer of Strange Fruit a 1970s band trying to pull itself together for a 20th-anniversary concert. Poor ravaged Ray coming up on his 50th birthday has an icy epiphany on a frozen canal in Holland and the pain of the moment may leave you gasping rather than laughing. The movie a bittersweet song of yearning and unlikely reconciliation was written by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais. ENLARGE Grosse Pointe Blank (1997) John Cusacks disconsolate hit man Martin Q. Blank decides to kill two birds with one stone. On the same weekend hes supposed to assassinate someone in his home town of Grosse Pointe an affluent suburb of Detroit he searches for meaning in his life by attending his 10th high-school reunion. Its a premise that could quickly turn ugly (or simply go flat as it does toward the end). Mainly though the director George Armitage working from a dense script by Tom Jankiewicz D.V. DeVincentis Steve Pink and Mr. Cusack sustains an impressive level of crazed logic and whirligig energy. ENLARGE The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou (2004) This quixotic comedy like ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" was directed by Wes Anderson and written by him and Noah Baumbach. And this movie like their new one uses stop-action though only briefly to populate a magical ocean with fanciful fish. Bill Murray plays the Cousteau-like hero an oceanographer-documentarian whos at once funny screwy childish gallant and rueful or downright depressed. When I reviewed ""The Life Aquatic"" I worried that Mr. Anderson by insisting overmuch on cleverness ""could be walking a plank of his own construction."" If any of that was true he has tossed the plank and in ""Mr. Fox"" gained a solid new footing. -- Joe Morgenstern Find television listings at LocateTV.

"MOVIE REVIEWS  A sly move  Mr. Fox is cerebral and lively. In other words its vintage Wes Anderson. - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEWS  A sly move  Mr. Fox is cerebral and lively. In other words its vintage Wes Anderson.November 13 2009|Kenneth Turan | FILM CRITIC The painstaking process known as stop-motion animation has brought all kinds of things to life from that big ape King Kong to the very British Wallace and Gromit but in the playful and funny ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" it goes those feats one better It reanimates filmmaker Wes Andersons career.With George Clooney and Meryl Streep voicing the Foxes the ultra-sophisticated Nick and Nora Charles of the vulpine world this adaptation of the Roald Dahl tale does more than occupy its own particular space between the worlds of childhood and adults. It provides a pleasantly cerebral experience exhilarating and fizzy that goes to your head like too much Champagne.Not since the memorable days of ""Bottle Rocket"" and ""Rushmore"" has it made sense to apply those words to Anderson. Though the director never lost his hard-core fans his work had gotten hermetic even stifling. With ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" hes managed to be himself and still let some air into the room.On the face of it stop-motion animation is an unlikely vehicle to make this happen. Its a labor-intensive practice that involves the frame-by-frame manipulation of three-dimensional models a process thats so much like watching paint dry that two or three seconds of film is considered a good days work.Yet this process was tonic for Anderson allowing him to create his own very specific environment complete with animal puppets that had real hair and wore spiffy corduroy jackets based on one of his own and an overall autumnal palette that had no use for the color green. He even found places for his usual cohort of actors including Jason Schwartzman Bill Murray and Owen Wilson as voice talent.Working with co-screenwriter Noah Baumbach on the droll Dahl novel a childhood favorite of the directors as well as the first book he owned allowed Anderson to connect with a congenial sensibility and to expand on the plot. He finds space for instance for the odd diversion like ""whack-bat"" a complex game no one can understand as well as the dysfunctional family dynamics of which he is especially fond.The basic thrust of the book however remains the same and that is the battle of wits between the larcenous title character and the combined forces of Boggis Bunce and Bean who are not a pugnacious law firm but ""three of the meanest nastiest ugliest farmers"" in Mr. Foxs part of the world.Mr. Fox is introduced doing pre-hunt calisthenics to ""The Ballad of Davy Crockett"" by the Wellingtons just one of the numerous eclectic artists including Burl Ives the Rolling Stones the Beach Boys and the Bobby Fuller Four whose work enlivens the soundtrack.Impending fatherhood forces Mr. Fox to seek less dangerous employment and in the elegant words of a British critic he ""forsakes thievery for journalism"" ending up writing the Fox About Town column for a local paper called the Gazette. Feeling a midlife crisis coming on Mr. Fox consults with Badger the lawyer (Murray) and moves the family from their safe hole to an exposed beech tree. And working with Kylie the opossum (Wally Wolodarsky) an old partner in crime he plans that gangster movie staple one last job that will set him up for life. Or so he hopes.Meanwhile the Foxs son Ash (Schwartzman) is having problems of his own. Worried that he cant measure up to his father he is further demoralized by the arrival of his cousin Kristofferson (Eric Anderson the directors brother) a great athlete and a deep thinker.As voiced by Clooney Mr. Fox is indeed a tough act to follow. Hes a suave James Bond type who is also given to typically Anderson-like metaphysical speculation on the order of ""I think I have this thing where I need everyone to think Im this quote-unquote fantastic Mr. Fox.""As that rumination indicates ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" runs the risk of sounding a little too arch so having key characters being animals is a big help in keeping things grounded. Though he says ""Ive got mixed feelings about that"" as often as he can Mr. Fox and his brood literally tear into their food like savage beasts. ""Im a wild animal and a husband and father"" our hero declaims and ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" succeeds because of its ability to strike the right balance between those poles.--kenneth.turanlatimes.com--FantasticMr. FoxMPAA rating PG for action smoking and slang humorRunning time 1 hour 28 minutesPlaying In general release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESOscar 8-Ball Wes Andersons Moonrise KingdomAugust 29 2012Into the foxhole with Fantastic Mr. FoxDecember 9 2009A production thats crazy like a fox  Look carefully into...November 13 2009Fur flies on Mr. FoxOctober 11 2009Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-fox13-2009nov13,0,2406547.story",200,fantasticmr.fox25,fantasticmr.fox,latimes

Its more Wes Anderson than Roald Dahl but theres plenty for kids and adults to dig in ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" a gorgeous and witty piece of stop-motion animation from the classic childrens book. For his best film since ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" Anderson has cleverly cast a self-mocking George Clooney as the voice of the corduroy-clad Mr. Fox who reluctantly gives up stealing livestock at the urging of his pregnant wife (Meryl Streep). Twelve years later hes a newspaper reporter. But when the family -- which includes their angst-ridden teenage son Ash (Jason Schwartzman) -- moves to a new home in a tree the old urges return. PHOTOS THE 15 BEST ANIMATED MOVIES PHOTOS FANTASTIC MR. FOX PREMIERES IN NYC A series of ""Oceans Eleven""-style raids on his human neighbors farms triggers an escalating war waged by their furious owners led by the cadaverous Mr. Bean (Michael Gambon). Mr. Fox -- who memorably gets his tail shot off in one scene -- must rise to the occasion and save an animal kingdom that includes his lawyer Badger (Bill Murray) and his sidekick Kylie (Wally Wolodarsky). Andersons pal Spike Jonze recently failed with another childrens classic ""Where the Wild Things Are"" by being too faithful to the original which was too slight for a feature-length film. But Anderson (and co-screenwriter Noah Baumbach) feels free to add character and subplots to Dahl making the story his own. Most obviously Anderson introduces his familiar brand of family angst including tensions between Mr. and Mrs. Fox that are unusually dark for a family film. The klutzy and whiny Ash who wears a cape feels rejected by his dashing dad who begins to regard his more athletic visiting nephew Kristofferson (Eric Anderson the directors brother) as his true heir in skullduggery. The beautifully colored and designed animation crammed with brilliant sight gags and supervised by Mark Gustafson is the most wondrous of its kind since Tim Burtons ""The Nightmare Before Christmas."" (That films animation director Henry Selick was slated to work on ""Mr. Fox"" but instead did ""Coraline"" which is a delight of its own.) In his last couple of films (especially ""The Darjeeling Limited"") Andersons curatorial self-indulgent and control-freakish style seemed to be suffocating his actors. But the directors approach turns out to be wonderfully suited to animation where he offers a painstakingly detailed version of 60s England and an eclectic soundtrack that includes everything from ""The Ballad of Davy Crockett"" to ""Old Man River."" ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is a retro marvel that should delight todays audience.

"Fantastic Mr. Fox reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Fantastic Mr. Fox reviewed. Fantastic Mr. Fox reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 12 2009 906 PM Fantastic Mr. Fox You dont want to watch this movie you want to climb inside it and play. By Dana Stevens After youve seen The Fantastic Mr. Fox burrow down a bit deeper and listen to our Spoiler Special discussion Fantastic Mr. Fox The experience of Fantastic Mr. Fox (Fox Searchlight) Wes Andersons stop-motion adaptation of the Roald Dahl book for young readers is like being magically shrunk down to 112 scale and set loose for 90 minutes in an exquisite handcrafted dizzyingly well-stocked dollhouse. If like me youre a lifelong aficionado of miniatures--someone who still presses their nose to toy-store windows filled with cunningly crafted furniture and tiny kitchen supplies--this movie will seduce you on tactile terms alone. The animal characters real shiny fur gently moving in the wind The infinitely detailed sets and props acorn-patterned wallpaper cutlery made from deer hooves bespoke corduroy jackets with tiny stalks of wheat in place of pocket squares You dont want to watch this movie you want to climb inside it and play. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The best part of Fantastic Mr. Fox is that as an animated childrens fable about chicken-thieving woodland creatures it frees you to enjoy these minutiae without feeling distracted from the real human story There is no human story. Though the stakes of the plot are life-and-death--the clever vulpine hero must find a way to save his friends and family from three gun-wielding poultry farmers--the fact that the protagonists are clearly dolls (if anything Anderson is at pains to emphasize their artificiality) allows the audience to luxuriate in the characters colors textures and movements without the guilty sense that were turning them into aesthetic objects. Thats exactly what theyre meant to be. Advertisement Anderson always an obsessive archivist of his own hyper-refined tastes seems more at home in this dollhouse universe than in the flesh-and-blood world of his last few movies. (Though Im not an Anderson-hater by any means Ive found his post-Rushmore films increasingly airless and meandering.) All the Anderson tics that threaten to get in the way of his storytelling in live-action films serve as assets here. Theres the monomaniacal attention to detail the statically framed shots with only one plane of depth and the signature Wes Anderson acting style deadpan and restrained but with a curious emotional directness. Unlike Maurice Sendaks Where the Wild Things Are Dahls story isnt an enigmatic self-sufficient koan. Rather its an Oceans Eleven-style heist caper with poultry and hard cider in place of bank vaults. Mr. Fox is a trickster confident to the point of vanity about his competence and charm but generous and loyal too. A more George Clooney-esque role is difficult to imagine--if Clooney hadnt accepted the part Anderson would have been up a creek unless the magic of his tech team could have extended to reanimating Frank Sinatra. But Clooney did accept and his warm masculine gently self-mocking presence anchors the movie. Mr. Foxs wife (here named Felicity in honor of Dahls widow) is voiced by an uncharacteristically tamped-down Meryl Streep while their 12-year-old son Ash speaks in the familiarly plaintive tones of Andersons longtime alter ego Jason Schwartzman. (Schwartzman as always is funny but the subplot of Ashs Oedipal rivalry with his dashing father makes for the movies few draggy moments.) In addition to condensing the four Fox children of the novel into a single character Anderson and his co-screenwriter Noah Baumbach (The Squid and the Whale) have added a host of other woodland-creature characters including Foxs badger attorney (Bill Murray); his opossum handyman and sidekick Kylie (Wally Wolodarsky); and his nephew Kristofferson (Eric Anderson Wes younger brother). When the animals arch-enemies three farmers named Boggis Bunce and Bean devise ever more brutal tactics to protect their vast stores of food from the tunneling pests Fox is forced to move from small-scale thievery to his most complex operation yet. By all accounts the making of Fantastic Mr. Fox was a weird concatenation of preindustrial craftsmanship and high-tech communications. Even though Anderson eschewed the use of computer-generated imagery and insisted on details like real animal fur (from ""safe sources"" according to the films puppet master Andy Gent) and hand-embroidered costumes he directed the movie remotely from his Paris apartment receiving dailies from London via e-mail and sending back notes overnight. (According to this piece in the Los Angeles Times the tech team was not universally overjoyed about this long-distance relationship with their director.) The amount of individual decisions this process must have involved--the movie is made up of more than 600000 still frames using 500-plus puppets built to different scales and arranged on 150 sets with some 4000 props--is enough to boggle the mind of the most obsessive micromanager. The fact that the resulting movie feels as loose free and joyous as it does is astonishing. On two different occasions during the film Mr. Fox and his burrowing buddies break into what feels like spontaneous dance. In reality of course these scenes were achieved by dozens of puppeteers and set dressers bending the figures into different postures rigging them to stand and then stepping out of the frame so they could be photographed then stepping back in and doing it again. Those dance sequences celebrate the joy of a fox cutting loose on a chicken farm but theyre every bit as much about the joy of stop-motion filmmaking the magic by which toys and a camera come together to create a moving dancing world.

Everybody except for the guy who wrote the original (and the screenplay) Roald Dahl. ""He hated it"" says Lucy Dahl 44 the authors youngest daughter. ""In fact I heard he wanted to get his name off the credits but they wouldnt let him."" Dahl also didnt care for the 1990 version of The Witches and if he were still alive were not sure hed have been impressed by Matilda(directed by Danny DeVito) James and the Giant Peach(the peach looked more like Cinderellas pumpkin) or Tim Burtons Wonkaremake (with Johnny Depp channeling Michael Jackson). ""My father always hated his books being made into films because he wrote in a style that is very difficult for a filmmaker to reproduce"" says Lucy. ""A lot of filmmakers have come up against the problem of how to keep what he does so well funny tragedy."" (Article continued below...)Which brings us to Fantastic Mr. Fox directed by the patron saint of moody hipster comedies Wes Anderson. You wouldnt think that Dahl and Anderson would be a happy cinematic coupling. ""Dahl was so skilled at inventing plots"" Anderson says. ""I dont know if my movies have been distinguished by the strength of their plots. I think some of them are questionable if the plots exist at all."" Theres a moodiness about Andersons animated Mr. Fox--with Bill Murray the voice of an uptight badger how could there not be?--but it melts into Dahls story like butter on toast. Dahls fable is about a mischievous fox (George Clooney in the movie) trapped in his hole by three gun-toting farmers who are fed up with his swiping their chickens and food. Anderson takes this existential setup and fills it out with an obsessively protective Mrs. Fox (Meryl Streep) his obsessively competitive son Ash (Jason Schwartzman) and a collection of oddballs who feel like theyre plucked from an all-animal version of The Royal Tenenbaums. Mr. Fox doesnt just rescue Dahls legacy on film. In a year stuffed with kid-lit movie adaptations its the only one to successfully reach out to children and adults. Anderson (like Dahl) doesnt want to exclude the kids who love the original. His Mr. Fox doesnt traffic in apocalyptic imagery (like Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs) or infidelity (a theme in Where the Wild Things Are). Yet one look at the bitter and bitterly funny death of a rat (Willem Dafoe) shows that Anderson doesnt sanitize the original tone either. Mr. Fox outfoxes us all.

The Fantastic Mr. Fox Where the wild things star The Fantastic Mr. Fox Where the wild things star Elizabeth Weitzman Updated Friday November 13 2009 204 PM facebook Tweet email The Fantastic Mr. Fox has one of the hallmarks of a great kids movie - it will appeal to adults too. Elizabeth Weitzman Updated Friday November 13 2009 204 PM Title The Fantastic Mr. Fox Animated adventure about a fox who outwits local farmers. With the voices of George Clooney Meryl Streep. Director Wes Anderson (127). PG Action smoking mild language. At area theaters.Few childrens authors have refused to talk down to their audience as resolutely as Roald Dahl. So its no surprise and perhaps a relief that Wes Andersons adaptation of Dahls ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is just as likely to appeal to adults. If were being honest in fact its possible that the chaperones will have a better time than junior viewers who will simply accept Andersons beautifully old-fashioned stop-motion animation without realizing how rare and anachronistically soulful it actually is. Kids are also unlikely to care that big stars like George Clooney and Meryl Streep lend their voices to play Mr. and Mrs. Fox. In early years the couple used to go out poaching chickens together. But once little Ash (Jason Schwartzman) is born Mr. Fox promises to stick to the straight and narrow -- which in his case means writing a newspaper column. Still as he repeatedly maintains he is a wild animal and we all have to be true to ourselves. Right outside his door are three farms just waiting to be plundered and after a while he cant resist. As a result the furious farmers are determined to flush him out of his foxhole no matter what the cost.Anderson adds a surprisingly conventional subplot about Ashs insecurities which are highlighted when his seemingly perfect cousin (Eric Anderson) comes to visit. For the most part though he honors both his own idiosyncratic style and Dahls dark bone-dry humor in every element from script to sets to soundtrack. The result is a visual treasure that successfully blends deadpan quirkiness with a wry realism rarely seen in any film let alone one for children. In other words you may question some of the morals (stealing is encouraged) and be surprised by the methods (death is approached in what now feels like startlingly matter-of-fact fashion). But then youll remember that this is how it used to be when certain grownups understood that kids are just as wise as we are. If not on occasion more so.

""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" Movie Review -- With his snug corduroy suits encyclopedic knowledge of British Invasion B-sides and polite obsession with the eccentric and dysfunctional rich director Wes Anderson has been a whimsical presence in American film since his 1996 debut ""Bottle Rocket."" His new stop-motion ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" helps give whimsy and Anderson back their good names. Fantastic Mr. Fox (PG) Fox Searchlight (88 min.) Directed by Wes Anderson. With the voices of George Clooney Meryl Streep Jason Schwartzman. Now playing in New York. STEPHEN WHITTYS RATING THREE AND A HALF STARS Ratings note The film contains violence and mild language. True Anderson fans -- and I count myself as one -- never lost faith. There had been too much promise in ""Bottle Rocket"" too much joy in the great follow-up pictures ""Rushmore"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums."" But ""The Life Aquatic"" was a self-indulgent water-logged mess. And charming as much of ""The Darjeeling Limited"" was there was something distasteful about using ancient India as a mere playpen for three silly rich boys to work out their daddy issues. Fittingly whats restored Andersons innocent charm is a childrens story by Roald Dahl. Of course Dahls fantasies never talked down to children. ""Now that your Mum and Dad have left"" his books seemed to say ""let your Uncle Roald tell you a story."" His ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" from 1970 featured thieving animals out to raid poultry farms and vicious humans out to stop them; it went into loving details of bad hygiene and worse manners. In Andersons adapatation Dahls adult approach to children merges beautifully with the filmmakers childs-eye view of adults. Mr. Fox (voiced by George Clooney) becomes like so many Anderson fathers a bit pompous silly and remote; Mrs. Fox (voiced by Meryl Streep) is like many Anderson mothers cool collected and rather formidable. The children of course are beset with issues that are deadly serious to them if silly to grown-ups. All of which are a little hard to sort out when their den comes under siege by the farmers Dad has been poaching from and the rest of the forests animals are living with them as refugees. Anderson and co-screenwriter Noah Baumbach cleverly compress and expand Dahls tale cutting the Fox cubs down to one sullen adolescent but adding a subtle mood of upper-middle-class angst (a subject Baumbach the director of ""The Squid and the Whale"" knows all about). Anderson meanwhile makes the crucial brilliant decision of shooting the whole thing in stop-motion animation using the same kind of handmade hand-moved figures as the original ""King Kong."" (Although the presence of Burl Ives on the soundtrack suggests a different inspiration the Baby Boomer ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" special.) The choice dovetails directly into Andersons own highly detailed style and old-fashioned sensibility while giving the story an extra layer of naif charm; its as if were back at the puppet shows of our youth watching Judy smack Punch with a stick or the Big Bad Wolf cast a hungry eye over Little Red Riding Hood. Granted even at a little under an hour-and-a-half there are one or two bits of obvious padding here and some of the long shots -- which seem briefly to rely on more conventional animation -- dont have the charm of the close-ups. Theres also not much need to hear ""Street Fighting Man"" on the soundtrack or a silly song from Pulps Jarvis Cocker. Still ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is a warm and charming film about family adolescence adventure and not incidentally artisanship. Find a child to take you; theyll have almost as good a time as you will.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Visually and conceptually Fantastic Mr. Fox doesnt remotely resemble anything Wes Anderson has tackled before Its a manic kids movie its stop-motion animated and its his first film based on an outside source--a minor story by Charlie And The Chocolate Factory author Roald Dahl. But if viewers close their eyes even for a moment theyll immediately know theyre in a Wes Anderson movie. Quirky musical choices abound Burl Ives and the love theme from Disneys animated Robin Hood feature prominently. Anderson favorites like Owen Wilson Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray turn up. The humor is painfully reserved and wry brought across via idiosyncratic rhythms awkward pauses and dialed-down performances. Tonally its indistinguishable from films like The Darjeeling Limited and The Life Aquatic. Anderson fans may actually find the busy quirky visuals distracting as if they were trying to listen to a familiar album while watching an unfamiliar TV show. The animation (helmed by The PJs Mark Gustafson) is almost more distraction than boon. Its distinctive with rich colors and a vast wealth of detail including visual jokes for the sharp-eyed. Its also awkward and clunky with anthropomorphic animal characters that move exactly like the rigid dolls they are down to their stiff perpetually shifting fake fur. Given the state of the art as seen earlier this year in Coraline (whose director Henry Selick was briefly attached to this film) Fantastic Mr. Fox looks like a throwback to the Rankin-Bass holiday specials of the 60s and 70s. It may be deliberately retro but it still looks clumsy. And who knows what kids will make of the story. Dahls short book is a simple adventure about a vain fox at war with three grumpy farmers. The film version co-scripted by Anderson and The Squid And The Whales Noah Baumbach keeps the story but expands it with complicated familial conflicts. Disappointment jealousy and frustration seethes between Mr. and Mrs. Fox (George Clooney and Meryl Streep) their weird hateful son (Jason Schwartzman) and his irritatingly perfect cousin (Eric Chase Anderson). As with all things Anderson the emotions are large but mostly kept buttoned down under snark swagger and fast-moving chatter that will probably go over kids heads. But then this is no more a kids movie for kids than Where The Wild Things are; its a film strictly for Wes Anderson fans of all ages. By now they should know who they are.

But from the first minute of the Wes Anderson stop-motion-animated feature ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" Clooney is that creature the genuinely fantastic Mr. Fox of the title a rapscallion charmer who wears many hats husband father newspaperman chicken thief. Its one thing for an actor to feel comfortable in his own skin; its another for him to feel completely at home in the body of a fake-fur and metal-armature vulpus vulpus. And yet Clooneys naturalism is of a piece with the joyous marvelously detailed movie around him adapted from Roald Dahls novel with adventurousness and seemingly boundless love by Anderson and Noah Baumbach. ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is possibly the finest picture about family community and poultry thievery ever made.Early in ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" the youthful wily Mr. Fox learns that Mrs. Fox (Meryl Streep) is pregnant. He vows to quit his life of crime and start making an honest living the better to care for his new family. Fast-forward several fox years Mr. Fox is now a newspaper columnist and the dapper-yet-casual cords he used to wear appear to have been put in storage. Now his skinny arms with their furry elbows dangle from the awkwardly utilitarian short-sleeve shirts he now wears. Mrs. Fox is happy enough in the hole in the ground where the family now lives. But Mr. Fox wants more He likes trees grass action. And so he leaves for work one day -- first casting a baffled glance at the superhero-cape and pants-tucked-into-socks outfit his weirdo son Ash (Jason Schwartzman) is wearing -- and goes straight to see his lawyer Badger (Bill Murray) to investigate the possibility of purchasing a new home inside a shady tree.Clearly its midlife-crisis time for Mr. Fox who not only moves his family into that new home but reenters a life of crime enlisting the help of a spacey possum Kylie (Wally Wolodarsky) to infiltrate the fortresses of three very rich and very mean local farmers Boggis (Robin Hurlstone) Bunce (Hugo Guinness) and the nastiest of them all Bean (Michael Gambon). Before long Mr. Foxs mild-mannered yoga-enthusiast nephew Kristofferson (Eric Anderson) a gifted natural athlete is also reluctantly pulled into the act to the annoyance of the scrawny disaffected kit Ash who yearns to be a star at something and feels hes good at nothing.Dahls novel is slim and exciting It covers in a very small number of pages the Fox familys efforts to dig themselves deeper and deeper into the ground in order to escape the farmers who have become obsessed with destroying them. Other woodland animals have also become displaced by the farmers aggressive mania and so Mr. Fox and his family in addition to saving themselves come to the aid of their homeless neighbors. They do this of course by stealing -- this is after all a Roald Dahl story with all the vaguely disreputable pleasures that implies.Theres a crotchety generosity to Dahls work too which Anderson and Baumbach have captured perfectly here. To fill out a feature-length movie theyve had to expand upon and embroider Dahls story but theyve done so without bloating the picture or overloading it. ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" feels colloquial and modern When we first meet Mrs. Fox shes wearing an Indian-style tunic decorated with braid embroidery a favorite hip-mom uniform among young mothers everywhere. And Mr. Fox early in the film explains apologetically ""I used to steal birds but now Im a newspaperman"" perhaps a reflection not just on his lost wild youth but on the fact that hes moved on to a profession thats pretty much facing extinction itself.But ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" also shows a sense of protectiveness toward the past largely because of the somewhat rough-looking slightly jerky (by digital-animation standards at least) folk-art-style stop-motion animation technique Anderson has chosen. The puppets with their kind-of-crazy eyes and even crazier whorls of fur capture the spirit if not necessarily the specifics of the cheerful mildly insane Quentin Blake illustrations that accompany Dahls text. Anderson and his team (including of course a large crew of animators as well as production designer Nelson Lowry and director of photography Tristan Oliver) pay a great deal of attention to texture and movement The animals fur swirls every which way in accordance with their movements; even Mr. Foxs suits were reportedly modeled on the corduroy and tweed ones Anderson himself favors. (The puppet makers went so far as to obtain fabric swatches from Andersons tailor.) You Might Also Like Anderson also has a great deal of fun contrasting his fantasy foxes with their real-life counterparts in nature His foxes walk and speak with the most elegant manners -- it doesnt hurt that the structure of their legs makes it look as if theyre walking on tiny high-heels. They hover over exquisitely prepared platters of food savoring the delicate blend of aromas -- and then descend upon them suddenly realistically foxlike snuffling and snarfling and sending food flying all over the place.Theres so much to look at and to giggle over in ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" It has style and wit and heart without ever being overly whimsical a trap Anderson has too often fallen into. ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" could turn out to be the one movie Wes Anderson naysayers end up loving and the one his loyal fans treat as a lesser accomplishment a trifle. Anderson has always frustrated me On the plus side I can sense that he tries to work from the heart and he certainly cares about craftsmanship. But nearly all of his movies until now have suffered from self-conscious quaintness and their flat homespun quirks have left me cold. ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is different The story is a great canvas for Andersons visual inventiveness (offering for one thing lots of opportunities for those cozy dollhouse-style cross-section views he loves showing various creatures going about their routine daily activities). It also revisits in subtle and wonderful ways many of Andersons key themes among them the prickly pleasures of being part of a jovial like-minded community -- or of a mismatched family. In one of the movies loveliest moments the cousins Ash and Kristofferson unable to breach their differences fume and argue in their cramped shared bedroom. Unable to sleep they creep out of their beds to watch a tabletop model train clickety-clack around its track in the darkness momentarily distracted and enthralled by the blinking colored lights and the soothing tinny whir of its engine.Im not sure I can explain why Andersons trademark dry clever patter seems less tortured and so much funnier and more believable when its emerging from the mouths of animal puppets with scruffy disarranged fur. But ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is one of the few recent movies I can think of that truly captures the vibe of a childhood spent largely with books. Im not talking about the overrated notion of ""being returned to a sense of childlike wonder"" or anything like that. Im talking about a movie that captures something even more intangible than that the very texture of an experience Looking at all the details in ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" -- the characters wayward whiskers their little vests the mansionette hideaways theyve dug for themselves in the ground -- brought back the quiet intense joy I felt as a kid first poring over illustrated details in picture books (the nooks and crannies of Beatrix Potters rabbit warrens and mouse houses for example) and later in the semi-fanciful semi-naturalistic details to be found in Kenneth Grahame and A.A. Milne and Dahl. ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is an intricately detailed and accomplished piece of work. (It amazes me that 2009 has brought us not just one but two dazzling stop-motion-animated pictures the other being Henry Selicks gorgeous and spooky ""Coraline"" adapted from Neil Gaimans equally terrific childrens novel.) And yet whats wonderful about it is how casual and free how un-fussed-over it feels. Anderson is clearly taking a stand against the strained realism (make that ""so-called realism"") of digital animation up to and including the repellent motion-capture technology that has turned the once-fine filmmaker Robert Zemeckis into a zombie. And in the end Andersons picture is more wondrous in the ways that count more palpably believable within its fantasy world than anything Dreamworks and -- yes Ill say it -- Pixar (with the notable exception of Brad Birds projects) has come up with.As a work of animation and of art ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is wily clever and mischievous without ever being too arch or knowing. It also has the distinct aura of something thats been made entirely by hand with care and affection -- a few misshapen nubs here and there only add to the charm. Anderson has pulled off the most elusive of goals Hes made a nonchalant masterpiece a movie that feels dog-eared and loved before its even reached our hands.

By David Germain LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story It may not merit the adjective in its title yet the animated yarn ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" offers some of the most goofy fun youll have at a theater this season. With George Clooney Meryl Streep and Bill Murray leading the top-notch voice cast director Wes Anderson has found an ideal story and medium -- stop-motion animation -- to bring his cockeyed vision to the cartoon world. Brits may be annoyed at this latest Americanization of one of their beloved literary works. Yet in the hands of Anderson (""The Royal Tenenbaums"" ""Rushmore"") Roald Dahls illustrated childrens book gets loving treatment and a distinct handcrafted style that sets it apart from the sleek computergenerated imagery dominating animation today. This story of a poultry-thieving fox and the evil farmers waging war on him is a delightful whirlwind of mayhem and high spirits. Its lightweight fun yet ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" succeeds on all levels presenting cute and clever little varmints to charm children while offering adults merry screwball humor that slyly stretches the films familyfriendly PG rating. Clooney provides vocals for the title character a fox who reluctantly gives up his glamorous but perilous chickensnatching life at the behest of his wife (voice by Streep) who wants to raise a family in peace and quiet. Years later they have a nice new home that stretches the finances of Mr. Foxs job as a newspaper columnist for the local animal community. The Foxes have a sullen teen son (""Rushmore"" star Jason Schwartzman) whose insecurities are compounded by a visit from his handsome talented cousin (Andersons brother Eric also an illustrator on the film). His domicile in plain sight of the livestock and produce riches of farmers Boggis Bunce and Bean Mr. Fox is unable to resist one last poultry caper but his raids on all three farms bring down the mechanized wrath of the human world on all surrounding wildlife. Trapped underground with his family and a menagerie of angry neighbors Mr. Fox marshals an inter-species rebellion against the humans who want to exterminate them. The slightly clunky coarse animation -- little puppets on miniature sets moved in tiny increments and photographed a frame at a time -- beautifully complements this shaggydog story. Some of the facial expressions the animators achieve with their furry puppets are as weirdly expressive as anything youll find in the human world while the Wolfman-like close-ups of Mr. Fox at his most manic add to the energy of the film. Clooneys in his best smoothtalker form and Streeps vocals are pure grace and class supported by great drollery from Schwartzman and frequent Anderson collaborator Murray providing the voice of a badger who is Mr. Foxs attorney.

Wes Anderson creator of the rascally stop-motion fable Fantastic Mr. Fox turns out to be born to make animated films. I say that with a bit of mischief because Im not a big fan of Andersons work (Rushmore The Darjeeling Limited). What I now understand though is that in essence hes always been making cartoons; he just confused the issue by putting real live actors in them. Before he twisted reality into a permanent ironic pose. Now in the infectiously primitive talking-animal world of Fantastic Mr. Fox hes become an ironic realist. Freely adapting Roald Dahls 1970 childrens book Anderson creates an endearingly tactile fairy-tale thrift-shop universe with quaintly painted backdrops cotton balls for smoke and a family of foxes who move in such deliberate fashion that up close you can see the hairs on their faces bristle and jerk. Yet Mr. Fox (voiced by George Clooney) Mrs. Fox (Meryl Streep) and their son Ash (Jason Schwartzman) inhabit a world thats disarmingly well lifelike. There are jokes about flipped real estate (they move from a hole to a tree -- i.e. an upscale condo) plus a very unchildlike soundtrack powered by the Beach Boys and the Rolling Stones. As a hero Mr. Fox has the arch self-possession to insist to his wife that he poaches poultry ""because Im a wild animal."" Against her wishes he plots to rip off a trio of evil farmers and the film turns into a modly surreal underground-burrowing heist yarn with Clooney as self-mockingly sympathetic as he is in the Oceans films. With its virtuoso tomfoolery Fantastic Mr. Fox is like a homegrown Wallace and Gromit caper.

Likewise if Anderson--a nostalgia merchant whose ostensibly contemporary films always seem to be unfolding in some irrecoverable past--was going to do a cartoon then surely he was bound to favor the handcrafted rigors of stop-motion over the lifeless perfection of so much CGI.Film studies majors cultural anthropologists and Sunday arts section editors will surely have their hands full comparing and contrasting Andersons fast-paced visually majestic Fantastic Mr. Fox which is based on the 1970 book by Roald Dahl to the seasons other high-art kiddie-lit adaptation Spike Jonzes Where the Wild Things Are. Question to look out for Is this sudden renaissance of auteur-driven childrens films (Tim Burtons Alice in Wonderland looming on the horizon) a by-product of Generation-Ys willful refusal to grow up?Never mind that so much beloved childrens literature is itself the product of fully grown men and women using the prism of childhood or fantasy to exorcise their own personal demons. When Dahl sat down to write Fantastic Mr. Fox he had already lost one of his five children to measles and witnessed another suffer from water on the brain as the result of a car accident. Understandably the book that resulted was a portrait of a father as family protector--the literal hunter-gatherer who must find new ways of putting food on the table after the three odious farmers whose bounty Mr. Fox has regularly raided get wise to his game. True to Dahls temperament the book was incredibly dark by turns yet relatively straightforward Mr. Fox was a fox his human predators human and never the twain should meet.Anderson--working with his Life Aquatic writing partner Noah Baumbach--has blurred those lines and added an existential layer to his protagonists conundrum. Onscreen Mr. Fox (voiced by George Clooney) is now a corduroy-clad gentleman bandit who walks upright and steals not out of necessity but because hes good at it. Fast-forward to several ""fox years"" later and Mr. Fox has at the behest of Mrs. Fox (Meryl Streep) traded his life of crime for a career as a newspaper columnist and the comforts of the life domestic. But in his heart he remains footloose and fancy-free looking to make one last score. ""Who am I? Why a fox?"" he asks literally stating the films unanswerable question. ""And can a fox ever be happy without a chicken in its teeth?"" Where Dahls book was essentially a survival story Andersons film has become a non-conformist fable about that wildness of spirit (our animal instincts if you will) we are encouraged to tame as we get older and ""settle down.""Like Jonze Anderson and Baumbach have done much else to expand and personalize the source material without violating its spirit turning Dahls effectively stable nuclear family into a more eccentric and passive-aggressive one with Mr. Fox a reckless self-absorbed paterfamilias in the Royal Tenenbaum/Steve Zissou mold his four offspring condensed into a single moody misfit teenager (named Ash and voiced by Jason Schwartzman) with significant daddy issues. Like the similar adolescent males whom Baumbach evoked with such empathy in The Squid and the Whale and Margot at the Wedding--their bodies changing at a frightening pace the worlds cruel realities assaulting them at fastball speed--the uncoordinated diminutive Ash finds himself in the grips of his own existential dilemma exacerbated by the arrival of his golden-boy cousin Kristofferson. If the characters and crises sound a touch familiar however Anderson works through them with a sensitivity that was largely absent from both Darjeeling and The Life Aquatic where style frequently overwhelmed substance and the characters appeared far less dimensional than Mr. Foxs plasticine avatars.For the reportedly painstaking labor it took to create the film is a marvel to behold--with wonderful shifts in perspective an intensely tactile design and an intentional herky-jerkiness of motion that only enriches the make-believe atmosphere. Clooney (speaking as if everything were a self-conscious aside) and Streep (resplendent as a former wildcat turned Earth mother) do some of the best work of their illustrious careers. Among the movies many virtues they render an unusually convincing portrait of a marriage a reminder that the most unexpected thing about Andersons film may be--underneath all the carefully affixed wind-sensitive whiskers and fur--how deeply human it is.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Fox and Friends Turns out that stop-motion animation and Wes Anderson were made for each other. _ By David Edelstein Published Nov 9 2009 ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Fox Searchlight Pictures) Wes Anderson uses stop-motion in his endlessly enchanting Roald Dahl adaptation Fantastic Mr. Fox so his animal and human characters have a slight jerkiness; and instead of experiencing the smooth computerized impersonality of most modern animated movies you sense the presence of the artists behind the screenthe life force. Featuring puppets instead of people Andersons frames have never felt so teeming so magically alive. He and his co-writer Noah Baumbach have added subplots and characters and themes to Dahls brisk cheerfully wicked tale and the additions are okay; but its the look that keeps you buoyed up your eyes roaming the frames laughing in surprise at the visual jokes and flourishes and textures. Its a dandys movie but that adds to the fun. The preening resourceful Mr. Fox is a dandy too. Mr. Fox has the voice of George Clooney which I thought was a mistake for maybe 30 seconds His toasty baritone is so recognizable you cant help seeing his handsome mug instead of the foxs. Then it hit me Clooney was doing his best work in yearsgood enough to kill the bad taste of The Men Who Stare at Goats. (Anderson and Baumbach send up his Oceans Eleven characters appetite for poring over blueprints.) An inventive thief Mr. Fox goes straight when his wife (voiced by Meryl Streep also briefly jarring) has a son; he gets a job as a newspaper columnist and moves out of his hole to plusher digs inside a tree. But material wealth does not bring contentment. He cant resist the challenge of stealing from his new neighbors the three nasty farmers Boggis and Bunce and Bean (one fat one short one lean goes the childrens song). Sneaking around the missus Mr. Fox and his antsy opossum sidekick Kylie (Wally Wolodarsky) pull off three splendid capersbut they dont reckon on the steely vindictiveness of the skeletal Bean (Michael Gambon). Dahls kids books have a sort of orderly whimsy and Anderson a formalist to the core is gleefully in tune with that precision. Hes a master of off-symmetry. I imagine him putting a character dead center in the frame unbalancing it slightly on one side then adding a near (not exact) counterweight so that the screen becomes a seesaw giving the illusion of motion even when still. Watching his other films I often feel his mannered compositionsgorgeous as they arevying for attention with his characters. (In his most affecting scenes its as if characters themselves are trapped in Chinese boxes chafing at the confinement of their spirit.) But in Fantastic Mr. Fox the grand design extends to the way the doll-like puppets seize the space From the first moment when Mr. Fox does his morning stretches on a great mound of dirt the characters seem to take pleasure in their own miraculous movements. Love of ingenuity is the movies message. Mr. Foxs second burglary is seen only on a row of security monitors behind an unaware Bunce On one after the other he and his opossum henchman pop up creep seize their plunder and exit stage right. How I wish Chuck Jones had lived to see that. Hed have died laughing. Anderson himself is a bit of a fox. Hell use any tricky disjunction to disarm you. Theres no way the disparate elements of this movie should jell yet here they sit side by side in the bric-a-brac of his brain. Frames in the foxes den have a depth of field that evokes Velazquez paintings in the Prado. Then a bunch of characters dash down a tunnel to escape the farmers bulldozers looking in long shot like a childs plastic toy soldiers. A confrontation with an elongated hepcat security-guard rat (with the stabbing voice of Willem Dafoe) is scored and staged like a Sergio Leone spaghetti Western. Not even Quentin Tarantino would have the audacity to assemble a soundtrack in which the Beach Boys Heroes and Villains is followed by Burl Ives Mozart Jarvis Cocker (as a farmhand) singing and picking a banjo the Rolling Stones Street Fighting Man andbelieve it or notOl Man River. Fantastic Mr. Fox is such a marvelous toy box of a movie that a bit of fantastic leaks out when Anderson introduces his pet serious motif the son who tries desperately to forge a bond with his self-absorbed unappreciative father. Young Ash (Jason Schwartzman) doesnt have his dads athletic prowess and hes dismayed when Mr. Fox sees a chip off the old block in his cousin Kristofferson (Eric Anderson). Thats fineexcept Ash is kind of a drag and his brave effort to save his kidnapped cousin (followed by chases escapes etc.) is the movies lone concession to formula. The final image makes up for it though a series of connected domiciles in the sewer system each a little dollhouse in which Anderson can work his wizardry. 1 2 Next Share this story...

Would it like The Life Aquatic... and Rushmore offer a hyper-realistic uniform of sets and costumes? Would it like The Darjeeling Limited and The Royal Tenenbaums explore an eccentric family with a father figure looming large and relatives at loggerheads? Would the soundtrack include the Rolling Stones? Would there be a role for Bill Murray? Jason Schwartzman? Owen Wilson? Would it be hip? Would the comedy have a gentlemanly sophistication and even be wilfully exclusive? Would it trade in emotions but feel distancing at times? Of course as anyone familiar with Andersons films will know the answer to all these questions is yes. So it turns out this is an animation but its also a Wes Anderson movie. The difference is that its light on its feet compared to the heavy machinery of The Life Aquatic... or the ponderous comedy of The Darjeeling Limited. Its also a kids film which allows Anderson and his gang - is there another director so collegiate? - to have fun. Anderson himself voices a fey estate agent and the film has the pace of a caper. What remains to be seen is how audiences especially children will react to the jolty bristling look of stop-motion animation in the age of CGI and digital 3D. The loving handmade purist look of the film reminiscent of Gondrys The Science of Sleep sees towelling as fields cellophane as water and cotton wool as smoke and will probably excite adults more than their kids who will be more taken by the constant active missions of the plot - elements that in turn grow a little tedious if youre a grown-up.Dahls book was a short sharp affair illustrated in pen and ink by Quentin Blake whose drawings dont have much bearing on Andersons version his colour palette takes its cue from the autumnal hues of fox fur. The main characters in Dahls book were Mr Fox himself a dapper chap trying to protect his family from danger and his foes three cider-swilling farmers Boggis Bunce and Bean. Anderson and co-writer Noah Baumbach (who directed The Squid and the Whale) have fleshed out the story so that there are more characters (Willem Dafoes jive-talking rat is genius) and the Fox family has more personality Mrs Fox (Meryl Streep) is the voice of reason to her husbands impetuousness while their son Ash (Schwartzman) a needy moody teen is pitched against a kung-fu-kicking cousin Kristofferson (Eric Anderson) who comes to stay. Mr Fox voiced so appropriately by George Clooney  flits between human behaviour (buying a house starting a career) and animal instincts (stealing chickens attacking his food). The push and pull between the tame life and the wild one is the unifying theme. Its all very transatlantic - the setting and baddies are English; the animals are hip Americans. This is one crafty fox - in every sense.Read an interview with Anderson here By Dave Calhoun Posted Tuesday October 20 2009 Details Release details Rated PG Release date Friday October 23 2009 Duration 87 mins Cast and crew Director Wes Anderson Cast George ClooneyMeryl StreepBill MurrayMichael GambonJason SchwartzmanOwen Wilson Users say (22) 3 out of 5 stars Average User Rating4 / 5Rating Breakdown5 star54 star23 star12 star11 star0LiveReviews|221 person listeningSign inWrite reviewMost helpfulMost helpfulHighest ratingLowest ratingNewestOldestLoadingundefinedNew CommentsRefreshNov 15 2010MavisFeaturedperhaps one of my favorite Anderson movie the animation is amazing. perhaps not to those who is used to the typical hollywood 3d effects audience. detail in the set (architecture) and landscape is fantastic so do all the characters. the combination of western cartoon and elements of japanese comic in characters are witty and funny. since I have not read the original childrens book there was no reference to the story line when watching the movie felt like a typical Anderson story about family fatherhood society values of life and many more that is only to be able to understood by adults and can be interpreted differently.

Thank god I didnaEUR(tm)t see it at the cinema. I agree with the opinions of the many customer reviews that this movie is tedious not remotely entertaining and (Time OutaEUR~s worst crime) child un-friendly. I have been a loyal purchaser of Time Out for around 20 years and having been disappointed over and over again by films that have been reviewed highly I have had enough. This film has been given 4 stars purely because it is quirky and non-Hollywood. Having said that - in one respect the movie is extremely Hollywood the goodies are American and the baddies are English.

I hadnt previously read any reviews - Id been abroad a lot recently didnt know it was a Wes Anderson havent read the book didnt know who was doing the voiceovers didnt know it was Jarvis Cocker singing till he spoke. I was just seeing what Id heard was a decent film on a wet afternoon. Two hours of our lives and twelve quid well never have again. I do regret not leaving at the start. The main character is completely charmless. The colour palette is depressing. The stopmotion animation is irrelevant as the movement is cartoonish particularly in scenes where all the characters move. The dialogue is tiresome and up itself. The music is brash and adds nothing. No-one in the cinema (a mixed audience) reacted at any time to anything that happened on the screen. Im convinced that reviewers see this primarily as a Wes A film and judge it on that premise; so many of the reviews start with a synopsis of his previous work instead of judging it on its merits. I wish this system allowed us to give no stars or a minus would be nice. Wes Anderson has made the worst film Ive ever seen.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 5 2009Sarah WFeaturedAs a big fan of Roald Dahls Fantastic Mr Fox book I was appalled at the storyline and quality of this film. The plot is loosely set around the story in the book but almost nothing is how it should be apart from digging tunnels under farms. The film is like an adult film just with animated animals (with failing jobs lies and cussing and my children were horrified by several things the way Mr and Mrs Fox argue (not in the book they call each other darling) Mrs Fox slaps Mr Fox around the face and leaves a scratch Rat is cast as an Italian mobster and has a flick-knife - taunting Mr Fox that Mrs Fox used to be the local tart Mr Fox is clearly disappointed in his (only) son and constantly favours his cousin who comes to stay... (Mr Fox has four children in the book and adores them all)... need I go on? None of this was appropriate behaviour for children to be watching and none of it in the book Im only kicking myself that I sat through the whole film (hoping it would improve??) as I regret putting my two children through the whole experience. Just read the book and forget the filmFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 5 2009usman khawajaFeaturedit put me to sleep -and my kids liked the popcorn better -so better go to tesco and buy a ten pack than watch this miseryFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 1 2009DebbieFeaturedIf you loved reading - or even better listening to - Roald Dahls Fantastic Mr Fox ... IaEUR(tm)m sorry to say youll deplore this film. Its not just the messing around with the plot thats deeply disappointing some adaptation is only to be expected in creating a full length feature film from a short novel. What really irks is the impoverished re-characterisation. Gone is Dahls wily Mr Fox whose cunning serves the basic needs of his family and community to be replaced by a (very Hollywood) selfishly ambitious and not particularly likeable creature. The new Mrs Fox bears little of the charming forbearance of the original but has been redrawn as a more predictably contemporary archetype. Badger is a paler-than-pale shadow of Dahls endearing creation. Rat is more of a street gangster than the hilarious boozy imbiber of cider that the author so clearly revelled in. The invention of the two young cousins Ash and Kristoffersen supports the sickeningly condescendingly and typically Hollywood motif that if you are true to who you really are (warts and all) you will win through. (Personally I think there are times when wed do better to try removing the warts). There is the perennial Hollywood display of what I suppose is considered passionate anger in the form of Farmer Bean having a grown-up tantrum during which we are obliged to watch him at length smashing up his caravan - great role modelling for children No doubt the justification would be that he too is being true to his ego and his mood (Dahl would have been a lot more subtle). Most mystifyingly the dialogue throughout is clogged up with the persistent use of the word cuss/cussed ... ???  Presumably to indicate that the characters are swearing without actually offending our ears in the process (which begs an interesting debate about language and meaning but I wont go into that). This distracting cuss word even appears as graffiti at one point aEUR"" am I supposed to find that funny? - sorry but is was just boring. Oh and by the way as usual with this type of big-budget childrenaEUR(tm)s film the goodies all have American accents and the baddies have English accents. This was supposed to be an end-of-half-term treat for our two boys. Suffice to say the five year old dragged me out before the film ended and I was glad to have an excuse to leave (I have only ever left one film before the end in 30 years of cinema-going). Our seven year old was bored. I did not see my husband smile once during the film. We all agreed it had been a waste of time and money and couldnaEUR(tm)t wait to get home to eradicate these poor imitations of DahlaEUR(tm)s much-loved characters in our minds by listening again to our wonderful recording of the author reading his own original version of the story. The verdict - save your money (and the petrol) - order the audiobook and curl up with your family on the sofa for a far superior experience.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 1 2009dontgetoutmuchanymoreFeaturedi took my just 6 year old to see this film - a story we have read to her at home - and we both really enjoyed it. she wasnt bored. the stop motion animation was great. loved the little cameo from jarvis cocker. the actors-voiceovers were mostly american but i thought that worked eg George Clooney playing mr fox with shades of his oceans 11 character. recommendedFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyOct 30 2009PaulFeaturedI loved the book and I wasnt expecting a Hollywood adaptation to be anything like it. I wasnt disappointed. From the first scene of Mr Fox standing on the hill listening to an American wartime flag-waving anthem I could tell things were heading south. The best thing about this movie is the stop motion animation Its great to see movies being made this way but the additions to the story line and the dialogue really let the movie down. The dialogue was the worst part of all. It gave the movie an air of being confused as to whether it was for kids or adults. Certainly the kids around my daughter and I seemed at first confused and eventually bored by what was going on. When I asked my daughter what she thought about the movie she replied We should have seen the other one. I couldnt have agreed more. If you do want to see this movie Id suggest seeing it at the Odeon during one of their APS2 adults go free pocket money screenings.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyOct 27 2009flixFeaturedStop motion takes so darn long to produce so the temptation is to reuse successful takes - over and over again - and theres plenty of repeat shots in this movie. It really should be a 30 minute short. George Cs voice for Mr Fox is superb shakes of Oh Brother Where Art Thou and stopped me walking out. The kids in the movie house were bored so were the parents - the film failed to generate a school holiday buzz of the Ghostbusters kind.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/87328/fantastic-mr-fox.html,200,fantasticmr.fox39,fantasticmr.fox,timeout

So old-fashioned as to look like something brand new the stop-motion-animated ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is as recognizably a Wes Anderson film as any of his previous features. Roald Dahls 1970 childrens favorite about a fox clan and friends eluding human predators has been transformed into a tale of odd family dynamics stemming from the behavior of an eccentric patriarch. The films style paradoxically both precious and rough-hewn positions this as the seasons defiantly anti-CGI toon and its retro charms will likely appeal more strongly to grown-ups than to moppets; its a picture for people who would rather drive a 1953 Jaguar XK 120 than a new one. B.O. for this Fox release will no doubt be closer to that of ""Wallace and Gromit The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" than of ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs."" The second talking-fox picture of the year after Lars von Triers ""Antichrist"" this one features not genital mutilation but a leading character who gets his tail shot off. It also boasts some of the most gorgeous autumnal color schemes devised by someone other than Mother Nature herself animal puppets festooned with actual fur and a sensibility more indie-rarefied than mainstream. Its a curious coincidence that Anderson and Spike Jonze two of the young auteurs who came to prominence around the late 90s have kid-lit adaptations featuring puppets (albeit of vastly differing sizes) coming out simultaneously and that both ""Mr. Fox"" and ""Where the Wild Things Are"" strive for such hand-crafted individualized looks. The films may have their problems but the least one can say is that neither very closely resembles anything thats come before. ""Mr. Fox"" is characterized by chapter headings that slide across the screen; trademark Anderson compositions that resemble storyboards and abundant lateral camera moves; a soundtrack that easily accommodates everything from ""The Ballad of Davy Crockett"" and the theme from ""Day for Night"" to the Beach Boys version of ""Ol Man River""; and a hirsute male lead who would look right at home on the cover of GQ. Mr. Fox (voiced by George Clooney) wears a double-breasted pumpkin-colored corduroy suit a custard-hued sweater and two stylish wheat stalks peeking out of his breast pocket. His slim trim wife (Meryl Streep) complements him perfectly and when he tells her ""Youre still as fine-looking as a creme brulee"" Andersons sophisticated following will nod with pleasure while their kids think ""What the heck?"" As in Dahls 81-page yarn -- whose pencil-sketch illustrations by Quentin Blake (in some editions) could not be more different from Andersons fastidious visuals -- Mr. Foxs pelt is desperately desired by three nasty farmers whose produce he regularly poaches. Boggis and Bunce and Bean ""one fat one short one lean"" launch all-out war on their adversary digging down into his lair before recruiting snipers to shoot on sight. The geological precision with which Fox and his friendsgreat escape is presented reps one of the films visual highlights as they furiously dig through layer after layer of earth to stay ahead of their enemies onslaught. Along the way Fox burrows up into the three mens properties from which he pilfers enough to prepare a giant feast while the war continues to the point of becoming a televised siege. But the overarching drama doesnt interest Anderson and fellow screenwriter Noah Baumbach nearly as much as the family issues. In contrast to the book in which the Foxes have four largely undifferentiated kids here they have but one son Ash (Jason Schwartzman) who isnt sure he can meet his fathers expectations. Joining them in flight are unassertive cousin Kristofferson (Eric Anderson) opossum Kylie (Wally Wolodarsky) and lawyer Badger (Bill Murray). Plainly set in England the film maintains a linguistic divide between British-accented humans and American-accented animals. The thematic thread here pertains to the maintenance of ones true personality and character strengths. When they have a child Mrs. Fox gets her husband to promise to cease being a wild thing (apologies to Jonze) and become respectable. When he subsequently reverts to his old buccaneering ways Mr. Fox must do so surreptitiously and when hes caught in a lie his wife is deeply distraught that he hasnt really changed. But its his true character that wins the day and its a trait Anderson clearly advocates through his own choices. Employing a deliberately unpolished herky-jerky style that traces back specifically to Ladislas Starevichs 1941 ""The Tale of the Fox"" but also variously recalls the imperfect but imperishable stop-motion techniques in the silent ""The Lost World"" the original ""King Kong"" the work of Ray Harryhausen Norman McLarens ""A Chairy Tale"" and many others the film achieves a feel that is at once coarse-grained and elegant antiquated and the height of fashion. That said individual scenes often go off in irritatingly self-indulgent directions especially when they brush upon lifestyle issues meditation timeouts and too-cute observations. Much is being made of reports that Anderson was not physically present during the films actual making in London that he directed by remote links from Paris. Its also a matter of record that Henry Selick who created stop-motion sequences for Andersons ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"" was originally slated to co-direct ""Fantastic Mr. Fox."" Whatever the case Andersons indelible imprint is on every frame here more for better than for worse. All craft aspects are aces.
