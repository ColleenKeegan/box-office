Comments BloodRayne Just when you thought camp was dead along comes this bizarre cross between a Tarantino knockoff and a Hammer horror film. Kristanna Loken (Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines) plays a sword-slinging bisexual 18th-century ""dhampir"" (part vampire part human) out to avenge her mothers death at the hands of ubervampire Kagan (Ben Kingsley of all people). As unintentionally amusing as Michael Madsen Matt Davis and Michelle Rodriguez are as her sidekicks nothing matches the sight of a periwigged Meatloaf vamping as a sybaritic bloodsucker. The two lead actresses sport tight midriff-baring leather garb and display 21st-century swagger in keeping with the video game on which Guinevere Turners script is based. Uwe Boll (Alone in the Dark House of the Dead) directed this hokum. R 93 min.

At this rate hell become the Ed Wood of this new movie century. In his favor he seems to be working with an intensity of output unmatched by just about anyone except Woody Allen with another epic due by years end. But first Hot off last years Alone in the Dark which cast Tara Reid as an archaeologist Bolls already back with another turkey BloodRayne which sluggishly trails a half-human half-vampire named Rayne (T3s Kristanna Loken) through 1700s Transylvania on a quest to stab her evil vampire father Kagan with her deadly sword-crutch thingies. Somehow Boll got Ben Kingsley to play Kagan (free trip to Romania?) but judging from Kagans preposterously cheat-edited climactic duel with Rayne he unfortunately wasnt quite convincing enough to get Sir Ben to show up for sword training. As you might expect from any movie that begins with the promise of a ""special appearance by Billy Zane"" and features Meat Loaf Aday decked out in a Spinal Tap wig and writhing around with naked women BloodRayne is ghastly-bad. But not ghastly-bad enough. Like all of Bolls films its based on a videogame but would that the movie showed half the pulse of some blippy Xbox brain waster. Instead Bolls aesthetic harkens back to lousy 80s sword-and-sorcery epics minus most of the laughs. If Dr. Boll -- as hes referred to in the end credits -- really is to take the title as a mad scientist of awful cinema he has to make these movies much worse if theyre going to get any better.

Starring Jay Hernandez Derek Richardson and Jennifer Lim. Directed by Eli Roth. Rated R 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The first sign of the apocalypse is upon us. But first a little background The majority of mainstream movies -- easily 95 percent -- get screened for critics several days before they open. About once a month a movie comes along thats so bad theres no advance screening before its Friday release. The studios may disagree but most critics will tell you that Hollywood executives are well aware that films such as ""Alien vs. Predator"" are inferior and theyre trying to milk a few dollars from the unsuspecting public -- knowing the Mick LaSalles of the world wont get a warning in the paper earlier than Monday. And then once every 10000 years or so there is an event so unholy and unspeakable that I shudder to think that children may be reading this. For one week all of the bad movies arrive in perfect alignment. Which is how I ended up driving to San Leandro on Friday to spend the afternoon seeing what appeared to be the Triple Feature From Hell -- ""BloodRayne"" ""Grandmas Boy"" and ""Hostel."" None was screened for Bay Area critics. As I walk toward the Century 16 Bayfair Center ethical questions swirl. Do I buy one ticket and try to hop theaters? Or do I buy each ticket individually and burden The Chronicle with a larger expense bill? A compromise is reached I buy three tickets and sneak in my food. (Mr. Pibb + Red Vines = CRAZY DELICIOUS) Provisions will be needed considering the chances are good Im about to watch 285 minutes worth of atrocious cinema. 1250 p.m. Theater 11 ""BloodRayne."" Uwe Boll is such a bad director that it must be intentional. ""BloodRayne"" may be the best of the three movies by Boll that Ive seen and it still gets an empty chair review. The plot of ""BloodRayne"" is basically ""Blade"" with a white chick -- set just after the invention of gunpowder but long before the invention of humor. Kristanna Loken who played the female cyborg in the last ""Terminator"" film stars as a half-human half-vampire who must avenge the death of her mother while stopping the evil vampire Lord Kagen (Ben Kingsley slumming like few Oscar winners before him) from ruling the Earth. Boll also directed the video game movies ""House of the Dead and ""Alone in the Dark."" His problem is in translating the source material literally without adding irony or any of the obvious adjustments that should be made when bringing a game to the big screen. Example When a character in a video game wears the same two super-skimpy outfits throughout a game that takes place over months its barely noticeable. But in a movie she just looks like a lazy hooker. Loken perpetuates this image further by exposing her breasts in an explicit sex scene thats nearly identical to Linda Fiorentinos famous hookup in ""The Last Seduction."" The production values in ""BloodRayne"" are horrible from the repetitious interiors to the ridiculous wigs. The hair of each secondary character seems modeled after a different member of Motley Crue -- good guy Michael Madsen wears a Nikki Sixx wig from the ""Dr. Feelgood"" sessions bad guy Meat Loaf wears a Vince Neil wig from the ""Theater of Pain"" years etc. The only notable exception is Kingsley who wears a piece inspired by the plastic braided wigs worn by those square-headed action figures in your Lego Spirit of 1776 playset. The over-the-top violence in ""BloodRayne"" falls somewhere between ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" and ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" but even that simple pleasure is ruined by the camerawork which gets shaky every time something potentially cool is going on. ""BloodRayne"" is the kind of movie where ""Lost"" actress Michelle Rodriguez shows up speaking with the most unbelievable English accent in recent movie history and shes maybe the 17th-worst thing about the film. 245 p.m. Theater 6 ""Grandmas Boy."" ""Grandmas Boy"" is an Adam Sandler comedy without Adam Sandler which is kind of like getting a root canal without the dentist. Amusing at times but mostly bad the movie is notable because of its trio of 70ish female actors -- Doris Roberts Shirley Jones and Shirley Knight. But while the films name and the advertising campaign suggest that theyre the center of the comedy ""Grandmas Boy"" is really a video game movie first and a stoner movie second -- with the ladies in supporting roles. Sandler comedy regular Allen Covert stars as Alex a 35-year-old game tester who gets thrown out of his apartment and has to move in with his grandmother (Roberts) and her two roommates. Theres really no plot other than a late-developing romance with his supervisor (Linda Cardellini) and an even later-developing conflict involving a game Alex invented. The ""Harold amp; Kumar Go to White Castle"" pot-smoking crowd will probably like ""Grandmas Boy."" Video game enthusiasts -- especially people who work in the industry -- will also enjoy it more than most. The movie does a decent job of lampooning the geeked-out cubicled dwelling of the average video game drone. But mostly ""Grandmas Boy"" is a bunch of pot jokes masturbation jokes and old people jokes -- about 85 percent of which fall flat. Covert is subpar as the straight man and his game-testing colleagues are mostly forgettable with the exception of Cardellini who turns out to be seriously hot when she isnt wearing her ""ER"" scrubs or her sexless Velma garb from the ""Scooby Doo"" movies. (Maybe she should have been Daphne.) Roberts walks away with her pride intact as the equivalent of Dorothy from ""The Golden Girls"" and Knight is mostly forgettable channeling Rose. But ""The Partridge Family"" matriarch Jones in the Blanche role is never going to live this one down. Jones who was once a member of the conservative media watchdog Parents Television Council plays a character who talks specifically about sex acts (she slept with Charlie Chaplin and Don Knotts) -- which is more disturbing than anything youll see on ""Desperate Housewives."" 510 p.m. Theater 7 ""Hostel"" Did I enjoy this movie because ""BloodRayne"" and ""Grandmas Boy"" were so bad that it seemed like ""The English Patient"" by comparison? Or was ""Hostel"" actually kind of good? Im 90 percent sure its the latter. While the themes of ""Hostel"" are so excessively gory that youll wonder how it got made this horror/thriller/sex romp through Eastern Europe is an original piece of filmmaking. The tone is too schizophrenic for the movie to be great but writer/director Eli Roth is showing serious potential. The biggest problem with ""Hostel"" is its pace. For the first half of the film there isnt a single real scare. Instead Roth guides his backpacking Americans (Derek Richardson and Jay Hernandez) like theyre starring in ""American Pie European Vacation"" as they make their way from Amsterdam to Slovakia in search of hot women who want to have sex with Americans. The movie introduces a slow-building creepy vibe in the second act before going full-on Tobe Hooper in the last 25 minutes. After packing so little horror into the first hour its amazing what Roth comes up with in the torture-filled snuff film of an ending. Like Roths first film ""Cabin Fever"" ""Hostel"" is inconsistent. Roth doesnt do much with the characters -- Hernandez plays a guy whos hard to like in the beginning then turns into a Harrison Ford action star at the end -- but he fills every scene with inventive details. The roving packs of feral kids who would bash your skull for a stick of gum are an especially nice touch. To be fair to Lions Gate which funded ""Hostel"" the movie was screened in some other parts of the country and might have skipped the Bay Area for a reason other than lack of quality. In the end only a few people are going to love this film. Its too slow in the beginning for horror movie fans who like cheap thrills and its too unrelentingly sick in the end for those who favor Horror Lite. But considering the options this week ""Hostel"" is as good as anyone could have hoped. -- Advisory These films all contain nudity and sex scenes. ""Grandmas Boy"" and ""Hostel"" feature drug use and profanity. ""BloodRayne"" and ""Hostel"" feature extreme gore and violence. ""Grandmas Boy"" features Shirley Jones getting stoned and then felt up at a party filled with bikers and strippers.

Gamers girl watchers and gore hounds are the target auds for ""BloodRayne"" yet another vidgame filmization by the frightfully prolific Uwe Boll (""House of the Dead"" ""Alone in the Dark""). But its doubtful that even the least discriminating genre fans will storm into megaplexes before this anemic action-fantasy fast-forwards to homevid. Dont expect it to stick around very long after Jan. 6 opening on 985 screens. Loosely based on the popular Majesco vidgames about a half-human/half-vampire heroine who slices and dices Nazis during World War II ""BloodRayne"" bears only a slight resemblance to its source material. Scripter Guinevere Turner (whose previous credits include the far more rarified ""American Psycho"" and ""The Notorious Bettie Page"") has cobbled together a formulaic scenario set in a vaguely defined faux-medieval realm where swords sorcery and sexy bloodsuckers abound. Rayne (Kristanna Loken of ""Terminator 3"") is a ""dhampir"" -- the offspring of a vampire and a human -- with serious father issues. When she was a little girl her mom was brutally murdered by her not-so-loving dad Kagan (Ben Kingsley -- yes that Ben Kingsley) a vampire overlord with a taste for comely wenches. Little Rayne grew up to be the star attraction in a circus freak show amazing audiences with her recuperative powers. Repeatedly cut and burnt by her handlers she recovers immediately after guzzling animal blood. But when she accidentally get a taste of human plasma shes shocked back into an awareness of her tainted bloodline and more importantly her thirst for vengeance. She joins forces with three vampire hunters (Michael Madsen Matt Davis Michelle Rodriguez) members of the Brimstone Society an organization dedicated to slaying creatures like Kagan. Shot on location in Romania ""BloodRayne"" has the unmistakably tatty look of a low-budget international co-production where pennies were pinched and corners were cut. The costumes suggest what ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy might have looked like if its actors had been outfitted at thrift shops. Pic lurches from incident to incident at a graceless plodding place offering little in the way of genuine excitement -- the swordfights often are confusingly cut and choreographed -- and only minimal amounts of guilty-pleasure titillation. Loken and Davis perform a spirited pas de deux against a cell door and Meat Loaf Aday briefly appears as a mack-daddy vampire who surrounds himself with bare-bosomed bloodsuckers. For the most part however R-rated pic emphasizes bloody carnage more than sexy shenanigans. (Whenever a vampire bites someone here it sounds like someone munching on a crisp apple.) Most of the performances are surprisingly bland. Even Kingsley cast in the sort of role that usually tempts great actors to hammy excess merely goes through the motions. The only live wire is Billy Zane who purrs one-liners with plummy aplomb as an ex-Brimstoner turned vampire. His character inexplicably disappears at the three-quarter mark however which is one of several indications that pic likely underwent last-minute re-cutting. Another suspicious sign An oddly anticlimactic finale that seems abruptly truncated. The door is left open for a sequel of course but auds may take that as a threat not a promise.

"BloodRayne fun comes in spurts - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW BloodRayne fun comes in spurts By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  January 7 2006 A few days ago I made a list of stuff I was looking forward to doing in 2006. BloodRayne"" Im embarrassed to say didnt make the cut but it has managed to give me a few things I didnt know I wanted. One was a trip to Revere which is the only place in town this intermittently interesting vampire-slayer adventure is playing. The other is a celebrity death match between Kristanna Loken and the increasingly shameless Ben Kingsley.Yes stop the presses Lad-mag princess squares off against Sir Ben."" Seeing a fit former model and an Oscar-winning thespian stab the dickens out of each other wont change your life but one does appreciate the convergence of two disparate universes for a cause I think we can all relate to Getting paid is funThe willowy Loken has been hired to play Rayne. Shes half-human half-vampire and totally miffed that Kagan Kingsleys ultravampire has killed her mom. Revenge is in order and Rayne spends the movie fighting her way from one crypto-medieval set to the next to get to Kagans castle where Kingsley sits on a throne and mechanically performs dark-lordliness like a coin-operated Dracula.If her journeys success seems contingent on tracking down certain power-boosting talismans (she drinks blood like Gatorade) its because BloodRayne"" is based on a video game. This means the director Uwe Boll is obligated to shower us with action sequences that hold up the narrative action. But Boll is more convincing here than he was with his previous outing in dank adventure-horror Alone in the Dark"" a sinful Christian Slater-Tara Reid-Stephen Dorff flick that funnily enough was quickly banished from theaters.BloodRayne"" has what passes for humor and a cast that passes for interesting. The opening credits in fact are the films funniest sequence Michael Madsen Meat Loaf Udo Kier Geraldine Chaplin? The rear meanwhile is brought up by Kingsley in the pivotal and"" position; Billy Zane in the special appearance by"" slot; and Michelle Rodriguez who plays her crucial with"" designation something fierce. (Shes clearly using the part to get in some much-needed fake-British-accent practice.)Guinevere Turner an independent-film actress and smart screenwriter (she co-adapted American Psycho"" for the movies) gives BloodRayne"" the womans backbone usually missing from these wet T-shirt contests. She even contributes sincerely coy vaguely lesbian banter for Loken and Rodriguez to spout while sparring. Your form is lacking passion"" says Rodriguez. Its part of my plan to weaken you"" says Loken. Your plan lacks passion as well"" And in this sense the film might be the first of its kind something to bring Maxim subscribers video gamers and loyal Logo viewers together.
