"Gone Girl - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Gone Girl Posted by Christy Lemire on October 5 2014 27 Comments 20th Century Fox Rated R for a scene of bloody violence some strong sexual content/nudity and language. Running time 145 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four. Theres a particular kind of narcissism that comes with being an only child. You are the confident center of your own universe. You are beyond independent -- youre protective of your self-sufficiency in a way thats almost primal. Why shouldnt you be in control of your surroundings? Why shouldnt you have whatever you want? Its your birthright. I speak from experience as an only child whos also the daughter of an only child and the mother of an only child. Rosamund Pikes character in ""Gone Girl"" the brilliant and bewitching Amy Dunne also is an only child as is Pike herself. Its the prism through which the actress found this elusive character this precise and quintessentially icy Hitchcockian blonde who serves as the unattainable center of a constantly shifting narrative. And indeed ""Gone Girl"" is David Finchers Alfred Hitchcock film. Its sleek and sexy a twisty mystery thats both dark and darkly funny -- surprisingly so given the subject matter. I found myself laughing way more than I expected -- sometimes at a sardonic one-liner or a biting quip but often as a release during moments that were just unbearably suspenseful or macabre. Part thriller part meditation on modern marriage ""Gone Girl"" moves so smoothly and seems so effortless it positively glides. Fincher has always enjoyed exploring the more unsettling elements of human nature from ""Se7en"" to ""Fight Club"" to his remake of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" but this time it feels as if hes dancing while hes doing it. Shot beautifully by his usual cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth edited fluidly by two-time Oscar winner Kirk Baxter and scored hypnotically by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross this is the most elegant exquisitely made trash. You could take it seriously though. Based on the novel by Gillian Flynn (who also wrote the screenplay) ""Gone Girl"" is dense thematically and it certainly offers a lot to chew on marriage identity trust truth. While it may not be saying anything new about the notion that you never truly can know another person -- not even your spouse -- it does so cleverly and with great wit and verve. But ""Gone Girl"" is also just massively entertaining as a stylish lurid escape to a place you probably would never want to go yourself in real life. Everything looks lovely on the surface though -- at first. ""Gone Girl"" opens in a wealthy suburban enclave on the morning of a gorgeous couples fifth wedding anniversary. But the husband Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) has discovered that his wife Amy (Pike) is missing. As the investigation gets underway as to Amys whereabouts Flynns scripts bounces back and forth in time and perspective to bring us up to speed. It returns to the night Nick and Amy met cute and bantered beautifully at a hip Manhattan party; both writers theyre naturally quick and hyper-verbal. It follows their flirty frisky courtship. It revisits the very public way Nick asked Amy to marry him. And eventually it captures some of the down moments in their relationship the complacency Nick felt once he lost his job and her disappointment in him in response. Once Nicks mother was diagnosed with cancer prompting the couple to move back to his hometown in Missouri it seemed their fate was sealed. Back in the present the days pass without a trace of Amy. But the usual hysterical machinery that builds during the disappearance of a beautiful blonde woman gathers steam volunteer searchers a hotline and a website old friends judgy parents freaky hangers-on and non-stop media scrutiny. (Missi Pyle is dead-on as the strident and shrieky Nancy Grace figure.) ""Gone Girl"" really nails the almost predatory way in which television news pounces on this kind of story as well as the relative ease with which the media can be manipulated; between this and the upcoming ""Nightcrawler"" starring Jake Gyllenhaal as a skeevy freelance cameraman prowling the streets of Los Angeles its a reminder of how eerily prescient ""Ace in the Hole"" was more than 60 years ago and how relevant it remains today. There isnt much more I can say without giving away spoilers which I wouldnt dream of doing. You really should go into ""Gone Girl"" knowing as little as possible and I actually hope youre reading this after youve seen the film. But I do need to rave a bit about the inspired casting. Affleck is always underestimated as an actor -- even in his Oscar-winning ""Argo"" -- but he and the extraordinary Pike both rise to the challenge of playing characters who are constantly evolving in our eyes as we learn more details about them and about their supposedly idyllic marriage. We in turn are in the deliciously uncomfortable position of having to reassess constantly how we feel about these people whom we believe side with and even like. Affleck also gets to have a little fun toying with his off-screen persona and the perception that hes smug or shallow. Pike meanwhile finds a way to be both beguiling and chilling and after years of standout supporting work in films as diverse as ""An Education"" ""Made in Dagenham"" ""Jack Reacher"" and ""The Worlds End"" its a joy to see her finally seize upon such a meaty starring role with total gusto. Also defying expectations Tyler Perry as the high-powered attorney Nick hires as he goes from pitied victim to potential suspect. Perry is shockingly good in this and he should make other peoples movies more often. Carrie Coon finds an appealing naturalism as Nicks twin sister and the grounded voice of reason and Kim Dickens is a consistent scene-stealer as the straight-shooting detective in charge of the case. If there is even a vaguely weak link its Neil Patrick Harris character a hilariously arrogant former boyfriend of Amys who comes back into the picture years later. Then again who he is isnt as important as what he represents. Its Amys world and were all just living in it.

Fincher is a masterful director who added so much support to a movie that could have easily crumbled under its own weight (there was so much going on so much story to tell in what seemed like a relatively brief amount of time). All in all it was incredibly sensational in the way the characters gravitated towards the most extreme behaviors yet it remained fully enjoyable and easy to engage. A+ Reply October 9 2014  by  JozieLee     I read the book before the movie came out because of all the positive buzz surrounding the film. Like so many who remember the Scott Peterson case (beautiful young couple pregnanat wife goes missing cheating husband prime suspect wife/fetus bodies found 1-yr later) I felt like I knew this story but early on it veered into new territory (into the mind of a sociopath) which I found compelling yet frightening. Flynns descriptive writing had held my attention and watching her haunting vision come to life on screen was like experiencing it in color. Ive read lots of message board discussions about casting. For me Ben Affleck with his laidback charm and Rosamund Pike with her flawless beauty fit my mental picture. Bravo. Gone Girl is one of the most intriguing movies Ive seen this year. Im surprised its not doing better at the box office. Maybe its a slow burn. Reply October 10 2014  by  Maxi     Why should it do better at the box office? It does pretty well actually .

So far fetched and cartoonish ... yet handsomely made in all the Oscar-bait ways we expected. What a letdown. And that ending ... rubbish. Reply October 16 2014  by  dede     I totally agree. This movie was really really good for the first hour and a half then after three days missing or so it felt like I had been in the movie theatre more like three years I loved the acting. They all did a great job but I saw about 4 different endings that would have played out much much better than the one they went for. It made it seem more like a cartoon (Thats how I felt about ""Con Air"" great movie until the STUPID STUPID ENDING). I really think this movie could have been a masterpiece. Take about 45 min off of it and change the ending to one more believable. Thats all she wrote Reply October 18 2014  by  Barbara     Im glad Im not the only one disappointed at the ending; Im still trying to get my head around it. And this is one movie in which I was anticipating a really surprising ending Reply October 23 2014  by  SharonScholl     I totally agree - what the hell was the premise of this movie and the big let down at the end? Totally Trash to me - filming good - story - HYPED Reply January 7 2015  by  CFriis     Far fetched? How exactly is it far fetched? Doesnt seem any more far-fetched to me than any other thriller movie ever made. Female sociopath uses emotional manipulation to ruin someones life and gets away with it? Seems pretty damn close to real life to me. Reply October 13 2014  by  Bubbe F     The ending.......I want my money back Reply October 19 2014  by  Arlene     I absolutely agree about the first hour and half. I was jumping out of my seat and as I was waiting for the ending it happened. No crescendo no ending. Terrible for such an intense beginning. Reply October 24 2014  by  Amy     So glad to see Im not the only one that thought it was bad. Wonderful acting by all just bad storytelling that could have been so easily improved Cant imagine that any FBI agents enjoyed it since they came off looking like idiots. Maybe Ive just seen too many crime-solving stories but this one had way too many glaring holes to be plausible. Reply October 27 2014  by  Jonathan W. Fink     I recently saw Gone Girl. For me the movie was a let down like War of the Roses without irony. The only part I found memorable was the ""Cool Girl"" riff. I was equal parts fascinated perplexed and amused. Accordingly I read the entire ""Cool Girl"" passage from the book Men always say that as the defining compliment dont they? Shes a cool girl. Being the Cool Girl means I am a hot brilliant funny woman who adores football poker dirty jokes and burping who plays video games drinks cheap beer loves threesomes and anal sex and jams hot dogs and hamburgers into her mouth like shes hosting the worlds biggest culinary gang bang while somehow maintaining a size 2 because Cool Girls are above all hot. Hot and understanding. Cool Girls never get angry; they only smile in a chagrined loving manner and let their men do whatever they want. Go ahead shit on me I dont mind Im the Cool Girl. Men actually think this girl exists. Maybe theyre fooled because so many women are willing to pretend to be this girl. For a long time Cool Girl offended me. I used to see men - friends coworkers strangers - giddy over these awful pretender women and Id want to sit these men down and calmly say You are not dating a woman you are dating a woman who has watched too many movies written by socially awkward men whod like to believe that this kind of woman exists and might kiss them. Id want to grab the poor guy by his lapels or messenger bag and say The bitch doesnt really love chili dogs that much - no one loves chili dogs that much And the Cool Girls are even more pathetic Theyre not even pretending to be the woman they want to be theyre pretending to be the woman a man wants them to be. Oh and if youre not a Cool Girl I beg you not to believe that your man doesnt want the Cool Girl. It may be a slightly different version - maybe hes a vegetarian so Cool Girl loves seitan and is great with dogs; or maybe hes a hipster artist so Cool Girl is a tattooed bespectacled nerd who loves comics. There are variations to the window dressing but believe me he wants Cool Girl who is basically the girl who likes every fucking thing he likes and doesnt ever complain. (How do you know youre not Cool Girl? Because he says things like ""I like strong women."" If he says that to you he will at some point fuck someone else. Because ""I like strong women"" is code for ""I hate strong women."")"" -- Gillian Flynn Gone Girl I followed up my reading with a web search. Sure enough as is usually the case I am the last to know that the ""Cool Girl"" has become an indelible topic of pop culture. According to the blogosphere The ""Cool Girl"" is apparently equal parts Jennifer Lawrence Mila Kunis and Cameron Diaz with all their negative pop culture stereotypes. I have one question about the ""Cool Girl"" All kidding aside does anyone beyond the age of 21 actually think this way about women? I know Im dating myself but when I was growing up the ""Cool Girl"" was the strong girl who did her own thing couldnt care less what anyone else thought and laughed off her own foibles and those of everyone else. I remember Esquire Magazine designating Diane Keaton as the ultimate embodiment of the ""Cool Girl"" by naming her as woman of the year. In fact Esquire named Diane Keaton the woman of the year in part because she was strong. I have always dated strong women who do their own thing who couldnt care less what anyone else thinks and who laugh off her own foibles and those of everyone else. For myself when I say I like strong women it DOES NOT mean I hate strong women and I will fuck somebody else. In fact I will fuck the strong woman because I actually like her. In fact I married such a woman. When I read things like the ""Cool Girl"" riff it spooks me. The passage contributes to the genderfication (I know I made up a word) and subsequently contributes to sexism in our society. Are men and women really that different. Not to me. I think gender (NOT SEX) is an entire social construct based on power relations. Now I realize that I am really dating myself. However I believe the proof that gender is a social construct based on power relations is all around us Look at gay marriage. To me is shows that the roles of ""Husband"" and ""Wife"" are entirely socially defined and have nothing to do with sex. Another illustration may be found in the work place. Plenty of studies evidence that CEOs regardless of sex behave the same way. A final example hits particularly close to home for me. As a single male parent I believe that I am as capable of raising a child by myself as any female. So while it may be amusing I find the concept of the ""Cool Girl"" in Gone Girl sexist regressive and ultimately destructive. Moreover I doubt most men and women for that matter actually think this way. Tell me your thoughts. Reply October 28 2014  by  Adam     Forgive me I have not read the book only seen the movie. But in the movie this monologue is postulated by a particular character. Without saying too much but taking the actions of this character into consideration I would say that some of her concept of the ""cool girl"" is regressive and as you say destructive. But that sounds like her doesnt it? I dont think thats the same thing as the movie being sexist. Within the context of the film I think its a compelling monologue because it speaks to the character and rings of some truth. Perhaps not the whole truth but some of it. Reply November 7 2014  by  gina griem     I concur..the ending felt soo unfeeling and unbelievable..It was hard to ingest And the acting grew on me..in the beginning it felt staged.Like the actors were just saying lines. Reply November 7 2014  by  gina griem     Perhaps in the obsessive perspective of wanting to be validated accepted and loved as the cool girl.It contributed to poor Amys unstable mental condition.The disloyalty of her hubby sent her over the edge and made her question all that she was and what they had.And after all her efforts to be perfect in his eyeshe must pay for his unappreciation and abandonment OMG.. her character felt so empty and shallow.How horrible to live and breathe for anothers approval and not have anIity identity. Reply January 8 2015  by  Tony Seliquini     It was the monologue of a sociopath. Not the general public common consensus. So relax. Reply November 2 2014  by  Irene     You are a cool guy. Reply January 7 2015  by  CFriis     Methinks someone is jealous and bitter over not having an attractive personality (being a cool girl). The concept of the ""cool girl"" is no more sexist regressive or destructive than the concepts cute guy dude-bro frat-boy etc. They are all colloquialisms used subjectively by people to help describe other people. Reply January 30 2015  by  John Doe     Well this might hurt a little -- try to remember you asked for it. My thoughts? After seeing the film my thoughts re yours amp; others disappointment with the film is this if youve been so fortunate to never have had a troubled marriage then you will have predictable trouble grasping the point of the films finale. The brilliance of the conclusion is in its resistance to being a typical ""Hollywood ending"" posing the troubling questions that every struggling married couple faces ""What have we done to each other? What WILL we do...?"" Shes a narcissistic psychopath hes a lying cheat. But because we humans are endowed (or plagued) from time to time by oversized egos we make lots of excuses rather then face the truth. In the rotting relationship at the heart of this film both participants are actually resurrected -- though not in desirable form. Now the dilemma -- which is worse to remain in the lie and hope for some Deus ex machina or blow it all up and face the inevitable consequences? Still think its far-fetched...? Talk to some divorce counsellors...or better yet to divorce attorneys. Reply November 2 2014  by  Nina     Good movie in the first half but ending VERY disappointing Reply November 7 2014  by  gina griem     I concur..the ending felt soo unfeeling and unbelievable..It was hard to ingest And the acting grew on me..in the beginning it felt staged.Like the actors were just saying lines. Reply December 15 2014  by  Ronson     Rosamund Pike was indeed a great actor in this film. She played her character wonderfully and I was truly frightful of her and what shes capable of. I think the ending sucked... the guy is stuck with his wife whos a sociopath... THE END. But I kind of enjoy the idea of the film appearances and impressions mean everything but they are not accurate representations and those impressions can be easily sculpted. Even better the idea is applied to something liek our idea of marriages where the assumption is that the couple are happy predestined lovers when in fact they might just be scared to be alone or pre-arranged marriages or looking to marry due to social pressures or because they fell in love with the idea of marriage rather than the person theyre marrying.

How are you feeling? What have we done to each other?"" The voice is Ben Afflecks and the image on the screen is the back of a womans head resting on a pillow--his wifes head. She is blonde and even before she turns to face the camera we know she will be beautiful. (She is after all played by Rosamund Pike.) It all might make for a touching opening to the film Gone Girl if only Afflecks conjugal musings did not take this unpromising turn ""I imagine cracking open her head unspooling her brain trying to get answers."" Umm maybe better just to ask?Affleck plays Nick Dunne the husband; Pike plays Amy Elliott-Dunne the wife; and the fate of her pretty head--along with the rest of her--is the central mystery of David Finchers faithful intriguing adaptation of Gillian Flynns gazillion-selling novel.Related Story Fall Movie Preview 21 Buzzy Awards-Season Contenders Like the book the film tells its story for a while at least in the form of two interwoven strands of he-said/she-said the narrative DNA of an unraveling marriage. We watch as Nick on the morning of the couples fifth anniversary goes to the bar he co-manages with his sister Margo (Carrie Coon) for a far-too-early whiskey. When he returns to his home--a lifeless McMansion in depressed North Carthage Missouri--his wife is missing and there are signs of a struggle. He calls the police and two detectives (Kim Dickens and Patrick Fugit) arrive to conduct an investigation that leads inevitably to Nick himself. Does he seem insufficiently concerned about Amys disappearance? How can he be so clueless regarding her daily life? Why doesnt he even know her blood type? And whats with that shit-eating grin he seems incapable of suppressing?Nicks story of loss (perhaps?) or murder (perhaps?) alternates with Amys version of events though the events in question are not the same. Rather she describes in diary-entry flashbacks their backstory the years-long tick-tock of how she and Nick wound up unhappily-ever-after in the North Carthage McMansion. Their relationship begins after all with vastly more promise and glamor a sizzling romance in magazine-world Manhattan. Nick writes for a mens mag; Amy creates personality quizzes. They meet at a hipster party where he promises that hes ""the guy to save you from all this awesomeness."" ""Its hard to believe you"" she tells him adding tartly ""I think its the chin.""Their early days are a whirlwind of spectacular sex and clever in-jokes. But then the recession hits and both their magazine jobs are downsized out of existence. Amys substantial inheritance--the product of the ""Amazing Amy"" books written by her psychologist parents who transmuted her childhood into a lucrative franchise--becomes dramatically less substantial when said parents deep in debt ask for her trust fund back. Things only get worse when Nicks mom gets cancer and they move out to Missouri where he grew up to help. Soon enough they find themselves stuck there semi-jobless almost friendless watching their resentments multiply like a plague.Affleck has always tended toward onscreen reticence and here that serves him well.Had things gotten bad enough for Nick to kill Amy? Had they possibly gotten even worse? In deference to readers unfamiliar with Flynns novel I will reveal none of its many twists or turns. For the rest I will offer reassurance that they are all reproduced onscreen with only modest tweaks and tinkers. The script by Flynn herself retains many of the novels wickedest lines (Margos recommendation on what Nick ought to give Amy for that fifth--i.e. ""wood""--anniversary is there in all its obscene splendor) and on occasion a gag is even sharpened as with the envelope marked ""Clue One.""As Nick Affleck gives a better performance than he has in years. Hes always tended toward a certain onscreen reticence and here that ambiguity serves him well Is he smarmy or awkwardly overcompensating? A cold-blooded killer or a hapless hubby? The role of Amy represents a still bigger break for Pike who made her feature-film debut at the lowest ebb of Bond-dom in Die Another Day and has since often been forced to rise above such fare as Wrath of the Titans and Jack Reacher. (She also made the most of her limited opportunities in last years excellent The Worlds End.) The role of Amy is trickier even than that of Nick with the possible moral poles she might inhabit still more distant Is she the perfect wife? Or calculatedly pretend-perfect? Without giving anything away I will say that Pike brings off the difficult role with admirable poise and I expect the quality of the scripts landing on her agents desk to improve commensurately.The supporting cast is comparably excellent. Tyler Perry has a charming charismatic turn as Tanner Bolt all-star attorney for beleaguered husbands. Dickens (especially) and Fugit are first-rate as Detectives Boney and Gilpin. And Carrie Coon (The Leftovers) is so good as Nicks sister Margo (""Go"" for short) that I can scarcely imagine her in another role. The quality continues all the way down to the minor characters--notable are Sela Ward as a cable TV host and Missi Pyle as a not-at-all subtle stand-in for Nancy Grace--with one glaring and especially disappointing exception. I stand behind no one in my fondness for Neil Patrick Harris. But the character he plays a former boyfriend of Amys named Desi Collings was problematic in the book and here verges on camp.Finchers direction is exactly as one might expect and this is for the most part a very good thing. The meticulous control of narrative detail that he brought to past thrillers (Se7en The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and his masterpiece Zodiac) is very much on display as is his knack for gradually increasing pressure until the movie is almost painfully distended with suspense. In the sharp crackling dialogue there are echoes too of The Social Network. And the look of the film (shot by Finchers usual collaborator Jeff Cronenweth) is clean and sleek brimming with technique without calling attention to itself.Fincher has upped the darkness of the story at a cost to its wit.If theres a complaint to be made--and its a relatively modest one--its that for all the technical skill of the movies Fincher-ization something has been lost. This was to a certain degree inevitable The chief pleasure of the book is Flynns funny nasty first-person prose and while the film retains as much as is feasible a good deal is nonetheless omitted or diminished. (The infamous ""Cool Girl"" riff is among the latter bits.) But even beyond the necessary contractions and translations Fincher has upped the grimness of the story at a cost to its wit and singularity.Indeed this has become a bit of a pattern for the director In The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo Fincher focused on the sadism and sexuality at the expense of the procedural detective work; in House of Cards he transformed British political satire into American political melodrama. With Gone Girl too there are moments when a lighter touch would have been more effective in particular in the movies second half. Nothing was likely to rescue the Desi storyline for instance; but ramping up the extreme violence certainly didnt help. And the conclusion of the film would have played better if it had emphasized the implicit black comedy rather than the (by this point somewhat over-the-top) creepiness.But Fincher is as Fincher does. And what Fincher does better than almost anyone is create moody meticulously crafted thrillers that straddle the divide between genre and art. Quibbles aside thats exactly what hes done again with Gone Girl.

The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz.

Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion. Continue Reading Charles Mostoller / Reuters Can Personality Be Changed? Scott Barry Kaufman Psychologists have long debated how flexible someones ""true"" self is. Almost everyone has something they want to change about their personality. In 2014 a study that traced peoples goals for personality change found that the vast majority of its subjects wanted to be more extraverted agreeable emotionally stable and open to new experiences. A whopping 97 percent said they wished they were more conscientious. These desires appeared to be rooted in dissatisfaction. People wanted to become more extraverted if they werent happy with their sex lives hobbies or friendships. They wanted to become more conscientious if they were displeased with their finances or schoolwork. The findings reflect the social psychologist Roy Baumeisters notion of ""crystallization of discontent"" Once people begin to recognize larger patterns of shortcomings in their lives he contends they may reshuffle their core values and priorities to justify improving things. Continue Reading Channel 4 The Prescience of Brass Eye 15 Years Later David Sims Chris Morriss brutal satire aired its last and most controversial episode in 2001 but its skewering of the news media feels more relevant than ever. A sex offender is thrown in the stocks presented with a small child and asked if he wants to molest him. A mob of protestors is thrown a ""dummy full of guts"" that is stomped to pieces within seconds. A radio host insists that pedophiles have ""more genes in common with crabs"" than the rest of humanity insisting ""Theres no real evidence for [that] but it is scientific fact."" Its hard to pinpoint the most cringe-inducing moment on ""Paedogeddon"" a special episode of the British TV satire Brass Eye. But 15 years after the episode aired it remains a totemic terrifying satirical vision. Few comedies since have dared to cross the boundaries of taste with such impunity. ""Paedogeddon"" aired in the U.K. in the summer of 2001 a year after the murder of a young girl had sparked national hysteria over the countrys sex-offender registry. Britains most-read newspaper led a campaign to publish the names and locations of all 110000 convicted sex offenders prompting a riot in which an angry mob ransacked the home of an ex-con. Brass Eye a parody of a 60 Minutes-like newsmagazine show had been dormant after airing one season in the UK in 1997. But it returned four years later for this surprise broadcast one that saw its furious (fictional) anchors barking from a dark studio about the plague of seemingly super-powered child molesters stalking the nation holding a funhouse mirror up to the climate of paranoia and fear that had built up around the country. It was a bold wildly insensitive piece of comedy but one that captured the growing madness of the 24-hour news media and foreshadowed some uglier aspects of its future.

It is a religious group with carefully considered beliefs among them that it is a key agent of the coming apocalypse. Heres what that means for its strategy--and for how to stop it. What is the Islamic State? Where did it come from and what are its intentions? The simplicity of these questions can be deceiving and few Western leaders seem to know the answers. In December The New York Times published confidential comments by Major General Michael K. Nagata the Special Operations commander for the United States in the Middle East admitting that he had hardly begun figuring out the Islamic States appeal. ""We have not defeated the idea"" he said. ""We do not even understand the idea."" In the past year President Obama has referred to the Islamic State variously as ""not Islamic"" and as al-Qaedas ""jayvee team"" statements that reflected confusion about the group and may have contributed to significant strategic errors.

"If U Seek Amy The Grim Grossness of David Finchers Gone Girl << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com If U Seek Amy The Grim Grossness of David Finchers Gone Girl Merrick Morton/Twentieth Century Fox and Regency Enterprises Movies October 3 2014 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Gillian Flynns bonkers 2012 novel Gone Girl opens with one of its two narrators Nick Dunne describing the head of his wife Amy and the violence hed like to perform upon it. The book proceeds to make a case for why Nick would want to harm her. Every time I found myself wondering why David Fincher would want to film this book I kept coming back to that head. Not only because Fincher oversaw (but didnt show) the decapitation of a different mans blonde wife in Se7en but also because most Fincher movies are about mind games. The Game Fight Club Panic Room The Social Network and the Hollywood version of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo He likes characters who mess with each other. He likes to mess with us. Even by the nutso standards of Finchers own fuckery Gone Girl is a sick movie but its a lumbering anti-imaginative kind of sick. Its certainly got a pull -- you almost dont realize that youve been bobbing toward a waterfall for two hours. Flynn wrote the script and shes pared down some of the book to bring it into the tighter alignment of a whodunit. One morning Nick (Ben Affleck) is bantering with his sister Margo (Carrie Coon) at the Missouri bar they own when he gets a neighborly phone call The front door to his mini palace in a suburban subdivision has been left open. He heads home and finds the cat outside and the living room in disarray. Also Amys not there. Click here for more 2014 awards season coverage. When she doesnt come back the police get involved. Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) and her younger partner Jim Gilpin (Patrick Fugit) lead the case sweeping the home and questioning Nick at the police station. Boney is patient but discreetly ambivalent toward Nick. Gilpin is a skeptical imp. Amy has disappeared just in time for her fifth wedding anniversary and Nick has a hard time explaining to the cops the semi-incriminating clues for the annual anniversary treasure hunt shes left for him. One clue leads to a pair of sexy underwear in his office at the college where he teaches. They arent Amys says Nick. But damning evidence keeps turning up and Nick keeps making foolish choices. Even Nicks sister and forlorn in-laws (Lisa Banes David Clennon) start to think hes responsible for his wifes disappearance. The national news media squat on his lawn and a Nancy Grace-type legal watchdog (Missi Pyle) hammers at him on her cable show. Eventually the water gets hot enough for Nick to fly to New York and retain the services of Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry) a legal magician specializing in defending the certainly guilty. As the investigation unfolds the movie deploys flashbacks that present Amy as a smart self-amused Manhattanite whom Rosamund Pike plays with a mix of salt honey and antifreeze. The flashbacks come courtesy of entries in Amys diary. The scenes in the present are interrupted by shots of Amy using a fuzzy pink pen to scribble with the phony alacrity of women in those General Foods International coffee commercials (""Celebrate the moments of your life""). She meets Nick at a party basks in a dusting of actual powdered sugar on one of their dates and lets him go down on her. It takes an hour to lay out the whole history between them. The relationship was great until it wasnt. The recession and a Changing Media Landscape cost them their writing jobs in New York. (She wrote quizzes.) Amy was forced to lend back most of her trust fund to her folks money theyd earned by writing a series of beloved childrens books -- Amazing Amy -- that were not-so-loosely based on their daughter but which were fictionalized just enough to undermine her. Then Nicks mother got sick. So New York turned into Nicks hometown of North Carthage Missouri mirth into misery and Nice Nick into a nasty dick. To wit the cut of his quick rough shoving of himself into Amy from behind and his heartlessly casual exit. There is a tonal incongruity to the assembly of the movies two sides. The would-be romantic flashbacks seem more foreboding than the scenes involving the investigation which are pitched as satirical dramedy. Amys fluffy pink pen flying out of a car window gets a laugh. But long stretches of any kind of humor dont work here. The comedy is used for telegraphing and judging; it doesnt play to Finchers descriptive strengths. When Sela Ward shows up as a network newsmagazine star shes so commanding that you want to see where shed take the part if there were more to it than two or three measly scenes. There are parts for Casey Wilson as Amys dingbat neighborhood friend and for a smirking Neil Patrick Harris who plays one of Amys exes. Banes parodies a mother-in-law snoot and Pyle twangs up a storm railing against every turn in the case -- shes another blonde head in a box. Coons wounded sarcasm comes close to stealing the movie. And the cuts to Boney and Gilpin (aided by Fugits ""whatever dude"" delivery and Dickenss outstanding fusion of concern and insinuation) are vaguely like something out of David Cronenberg or late Robert Altman. Perrys excellently subdued performance is one long ""yall white people crazy."" But the dark humor and broad caricatures feel wrong because the dread here is more convincing. Finchers approach to comedy works best droll and deadpan like in Dragon Tattoo. Almost everyone in his new movie is using italics and exclamation points. This is to say that Gone Girl is not Fincher at his frozen-lake smoothest. He seems off imprecise. Fincher is a director of space and a conjurer of atmosphere. He can make a scull pulling itself along an open river as remarkable as men chasing each other through alleyways in a downpour. He can balance whimsy and lamentation as he did in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button by using an old-timey deathbed flashback that explained the construction of a backward station clock. But Gone Girls opening hour is antsy and looks dulled. Its strange how little any of the Midwests flatness and sameness -- the hills planes parking lots anonymous faces the corporate Americana -- seems to interest Fincher. In time with the doomy pump-scratch-screech score by composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross the opening title sequence flips by the way you would flip pages if you were skimming them for something. He fails to bring Missouri even to dusty life. That could be intentional. Nick and Amy had come to North Carthage in defeat. There was nothing to celebrate. Even so the first half of the film has the drab flatness of certain television Lifetime movies. Only once this film has lost its mind does Fincher recover his lurid horror-movie composure. Flynns novel was out to critique one fiction genre and help consecrate another. The structure of the first part of the book relied heavily on Amys writing. Every other chapter was a diary entry that told a darkening single-girl-finds-the-man-of-her-dreams story. Amy whipped up chatty involved tirades against men who expect too much of women and the women who change personalities to suit a man. Flynn appeared to be mocking the moony plucky desperate heroines of so-called chick lit. She bleeds the genre into a grisly crime thriller a genre that she -- and Fincher -- seems to trust more. But to get from Bridget Joness Diary to The Last Seduction Flynn cant simply twist the plot; she has to break it. The book never achieves the right angle on Nick and Amys marriage for true social satire to take hold. It gets riled up and turns psychotic. You keep reading in a kind of stunned shock. You cant believe this is where Flynn has decided to go. What drew Fincher to it feels obvious. Its as if the novel had been crying out for his sinister talents trolling for them. Baited and reeled in Fincher complies. His moviemaking falls under the spell of Flynns mercurial deviancy. He is Nick. She is Amy. He is Amy. She is Nick. I cant quite tell. Finchers filmmaking is like Amys obsessive-compulsion carrying around a disinfectant and a lint roller. At some point she rants that all advertisers think women do is ""bleed and clean clean and bleed."" Finchers movies do the same thing. Yes Gone Girl the movie tries to hold on to the books attempt to satirize chick lit and put Amy at the center but part of whats off about it is that Amy never seems like an actual character. And to get at why you need the freedom to go into what the movie actually is doing; and to do that you have to talk about the second hour when the plot breaks when we go over the waterfall. So unless youve finished the book stop reading this go see the movie and come back. There are spoilers ahead.  For a good stretch of Michael Douglass very successful persecuted-white-male streak he played men who made bad choices often with blondes he couldnt resist -- Glenn Close and Kathleen Turner and Sharon Stone and Gwyneth Paltrow. (Demi Moore in Disclosure was a lone brunette exception.) Maybe hes trying to kill them. Maybe theyre trying to kill him. He gets desperate and takes things too far. The most exciting of these movies turned immoral extremity into a ride and sometimes the ride made the news. 1987s Fatal Attraction was enough of a smash to start a national conversation about marital infidelity. Careful boys she will come after your daughter and the family rabbit. It was a ""blank from hell"" scenario emerging from some private place of universal paranoia. What if my roommate is a stalker? What if my mistress visits my wife? What if this crime writer Im fucking while investigating for murder is indeed a killer? Douglas was a perfect avatar for entitlement risk and their self- and societally inflicted discontents. Usually someone or something -- his lovers his country -- was trying to confiscate what hed built. Douglas starred in a version of one of these films with David Fincher 1997s The Game in which a San Francisco tycoon spends a couple of days and nights running for his life. Hes caught in a prank set up by his brother (Sean Penn) that requires the participation of what must be half the city. Finchers a more sophisticated filmmaker now; hes got Reznor and Rosss funeral music and Jeff Cronenweths cinematography and Flynns screenplay has more going on. Still Douglas and The Game crossed my mind while watching Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike in Gone Girl. Its not just that Douglas is playing a Nick or that the conniving blonde in The Game (Deborah Kara Unger) bears an uncanny resemblance to Pike. Its that the movie has bogus ideas about femininity and marriage. As a movie character Amy feels like a composite of women who terrorized Michael Douglas. Pikes performance is not the problem. She throws herself into this part. You can feel her trying to gather all the twists and use them to break into something coherent. Hers is a better Amy than whats on the page her voice deeper and her manner less flighty. Pike is more like Faye Dunaway playing Renee Zellweger than I was prepared for. The trouble is the way the films portrayal of Amy comes across in the current political climate. For reasons known only to Flynn Amy tries to frame her husband for her murder. Rather than divorce him for his imperfections she wants him to suffer. Suicide was part of the original plan but her severe narcissism leads her murderously back to him. She needs both to see his suffering up close and to feel his bewildered love. On her way we learn of the other people whom she has made suffer. We watch her manipulate that ex that Harris plays Desi with stories of how Nick abused and degraded her only to watch her abuse and degrade Desi. Nothing about Amy is real except her psychosis. Theres some stuff in the book about women turning their men into trained monkeys and in the film every time Nick signals his goodness to Amy he puts two fingers over the cleft in his giant chin and its like watching Caesar calm the troops in those new Planet of the Apes movies. Nick calm. Gone Girl would seem like an ideal prism through which to see Affleck. He spends the movie trying to seem less like an asshole. Hes had a lot of practice. Nows he a star with some gravity as an actor. This is a passive reactive part. He colors it with rage volatility and foolishness but theres something gentle and failed about him here too. Hes got a paunch and he has puffed out his big frame so that his arms never fall parallel at his side. In his T-shirt and sweats hes like a lapsed football player. ""Im tired of being picked apart by women"" Nick says. The difference between this movie and one Douglas starred in is that this one doesnt provide the thrill of violent closure. Gone Girl is a murder mystery but its also a perverse yet limp comedy of remarriage. When Amy returns into Nicks life his part of the relationship is barely consensual. Successful remarriage comedies involve two equal partners consenting to sublimate their differences. Amy simply intends to mete out passive-aggressive punishment until death do them part.  The movie doubles as a snide contradiction of the serious conversation Americans have been having lately about men women exploitation and violence. Gone Girl isnt complicating that conversation. It gets off on thumbing its nose at it using a vengeful false accusation to exploit an old trope of the terrifying femme fatale. One of the ladies in Nicks life happens to be played by Emily Ratajkowski a model made notorious for appearing to enjoy herself while frolicking nude in Robin Thickes ""Blurred Lines"" video. Ratajkowski doesnt have a large role here but its significant to the plot. Her presence reminded me how much of the song and the video like a whole strain of rap and Ramp;B hinges on a woman being a ""good girl"" which in turn hinges on a kind of permissiveness toward the performer whos paying the compliment. In the music the good girl is also a ""bad girl."" Theres virtually no difference. The debate about rape and ""rapeyness"" in pop isnt a new one. But it has new resonance on college campuses where protests vandalism and lawsuits have challenged the long tradition of silence and slow action in issues of sexual assault. A Columbia University senior named Emma Sulkowicz has become a symbol of the refusal of assault survivors to be cowed Shes been dragging an actual mattress around campus and vows to continue to do so until the school expels the classmate who raped her. This isnt the first time that female student activists against assault have insisted on being heard (one need only recall the Take Back the Night rallies of the 1990s) but the protests have gained broader resonance. Theyre more confrontational and less tolerant of what can seem like patriarchal or at best bureaucratic foot-dragging and opacity. Theyve swelled beyond campuses to include criticizing even the conduct of once-untouchable professional athletes. The release of the Ray Rice video brought men into a conversation that for so long happened mostly among women. Recent investigations into domestic violence and assault in the military police force and even small-town Alaska have created a feeling that maybe just maybe the country is turning a corner on a serious and divisive issue. And then along comes a major work of Hollywood fiction based on a huge best seller written by a woman about a woman whose greatest power is to cry wolf. Its probably the case that Flynn just wanted to tell a fun story about a ""complete psycho bitch"" to mock the shallowness of some chick-lit heroines by having all of that frivolity and idle time and man-hunting mutate them into film-noir monsters. Its also possible that theres a strain of ideology that could locate the heroic feminist in Amys master plan an argument that the most radical thing Amy can do to avenge her sex -- or just herself -- is to make a man spend the rest of his life with a woman he despises and distrusts. I just dont see Camille Paglia asking to get an Amen for that. Its not as if the history of the movies isnt full of iconoclastic representations of women that involve sex. Barbara Stanwyck sleeping her way up a skyscraper in 1933s Baby Face still feels like a conquering act of empowerment before it seems retrograde. And no matter where you fall on Thelma and Louises crime spree and their speeding into the Grand Canyon they at least rode and drove for a kind of truth. However absurd that movie presented its last shot as liberation. In this movie the predator bares talons by pretending to be prey. What more is in it for Amy? What does she stand for? In bewilderment Nick finds himself wondering whats in that head of Amys. I dont think she knows. Whats worse I dont think were supposed to care. No movie can undo what the attention and activism have achieved. But Flynn and Fincher are presenting a glib and facetious alternative provocation in the name of entertainment. The movie isnt smart enough to think around the problems it superficially engages with. Amy turns abuse into a romantic fantasy for her amusement and for ours. This is a messy messed-up film about the funny games of coupledom -- Nick and Amys but the filmmakers too. Together Flynn and Fincher just get sharper and nastier as they go a set of claws creeping out from within a paw two freaks speeding down the highway to hell bones dragging at the rear of a hearse the wedding announcement whipping and warped in the wind just married.

But is he a reliable narrator? Merrick Morton/ Courtesy of 20th Century Fox David Finchers marital thriller Gone Girl is based on a 2-year-old novel that spent more than 71 weeks on the New York Times hardcover best-seller list and sold more than 6 million copies before it even came out in paperback. So a lot of suspense fans already know its twists and turns. But that doesnt mean spoilers are OK and because this review was written principally for radio (and my producers wont allow me to urge listeners who want to stay in the dark about plot points to turn down their radios) Im going to have to be especially circumspect. And thats frustrating because the film will almost certainly raise hackles in some quarters over issues that track closely with recent headlines that surface late in the story and that I cant even bring up without being accused of giving the game away. Happily I can point you to a thorough and engaging discussion of those issues right here on NPR.org. Pop culture blogger Linda Holmes has written two entirely separate -- and separately clever -- Monkey See pieces one for folks who want to be surprised by the movie and one for folks whove read the book and want to dive in deeper. I strongly urge you to dive in deeper once youve seen the movie. In the meantime though Im going to have to stay in the shallow end. So what can I tell you? Well even if you havent read the book youll likely have heard that Gone Girls story -- of a wife who abruptly goes missing from what appears to be a happy home -- uses the ""unreliable narrator"" literary device. But in a movie who would that be exactly? Ben Afflecks Nick a self-styled ""corn-fed salt-of-the-earth Missouri boy""? Or Rosamund Pikes Amy his classy East Coast wife whose youth inspired a series of ""Amazing Amy"" childrens books? One things for sure When they meet cute at a New York party -- a happy event as its recounted in a flashback -- they appear both well-matched and playful Amy offering up a multiple-choice answer when Nick asks who she is and Nick saying to her similar query that hes the guy wholl save her from ""all this awesomeness."" i Nick (Ben Affleck) and Amys (Rosamund Pike) relationship starts off as playful and well matched. Merrick Morton/ Courtesy of 20th Century Fox hide caption toggle caption Merrick Morton/ Courtesy of 20th Century Fox Nick (Ben Affleck) and Amys (Rosamund Pike) relationship starts off as playful and well matched. Merrick Morton/ Courtesy of 20th Century Fox Who could resist right? But those ""who are you?"" questions will be ones that haunt the rest of the picture. This flashback is from the day of Nick and Amys fifth wedding anniversary a day on which we watch a clearly unhappy Nick return home from an early morning scotch at the pub he owns with his sister (Carrie Coon) to find evidence of a struggle broken glass and no sign of his wife. Police detectives (Kim Dickens and Patrick Fugit) are stumped and when Nick and his wifes parents appeal to the media to help find Amy the story erupts into a tabloid sensation requiring Nick to hire a hotshot attorney (a nicely understated Tyler Perry) because hes not only the chief suspect but also as one of his TV interlocutors puts it ""the most hated man in America."" Thats all the plot I should probably divulge. Allow me though a quick note on structure. The film like the novel (because both were penned by Gillian Flynn a rare case of a novelist whos allowed to write her own screenplay) tells the story of Amys disappearance in alternating bursts of narrative. Nicks version of events surfaces as he deals with reporters and cops; Amys version is taken from entries in a diary thats discovered after she disappears. Their stories are increasingly in conflict and because Affleck and Pike are unnervingly good at keeping you guessing about which of them you can trust your allegiances will almost certainly shift as David Finchers direction delivers jolts designed to make audiences squeal while also letting you identify with characters one moment and wish you hadnt the next. His moody atmospheric work struck me as more intriguing early on when hes showing how social forces can put pressure on any marriage than it did later when he gets deep in the weeds of Nick and Amys marriage. But that may just be because I like Fincher when hes pulling universals out of specifics not the other way around. By the end of Gone Girl the social issues that animate the films beginning -- job loss in an economic downturn differences in wealth and class media manipulation -- have receded and things have gotten so plot-driven and pulpy theres nothing to challenge the director or make him stretch. In the films final stages he seems to be relying entirely on craft -- but boy is it effective craft.

By Peter Rainer Film critic October 3 2014 Save for later Saved Gone Girl stars Ben Affleck (l.) Lisa Banes (center) and David Clennon (r.). Merrick Morton/20th Century Fox/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of ""Gone Girl"" directed by David Fincher and adapted rather faithfully by Gillian Flynn from her bestselling novel is a murder mystery that may or may not actually contain a murder (or two).Im not a fan of larding reviews with spoiler alerts so Ill just say that in essence for those who havent already read the book ""Gone Girl"" is about a wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) who goes missing and the husband Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) who becomes a murder suspect. Amy and Nick both struggling writers in New York had relocated to small-town Missouri where Nicks mother is ailing. There they became bored out of their skulls. Their marriage seemingly based on the fact that both parties are collectively better-looking than anybody else disintegrates. The film alternates between Nicks and Amys perspective with Amys diary entries providing the necessary back story. The flashbacks to their swank New York lifestyle contrast harshly with the bland grayed-out Missouri scenes. Fincher and Flynn betray a snooty bias here Heartland equals boring. The only enlivening thing about this territory apparently is the violence that erupts from it. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time Ive never been a huge fan of Finchers Prince of Darkness-like prowess. ""Seven"" and ""The Fight Club"" were a smart adolescents idea of the heart of darkness and ""The Social Network"" was a glib smart-alecky epic about a master race of supernerds. His best film I think was ""Zodiac"" which was overlong but mountingly creepy. The 50 best movies of all time Video Gone Girl review roundup Monitor Movie Guide In his new film as in his last ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" his directorial finesse cant disguise the potboiler source material. (Nor does he seem to care.) The films stabs at social commentary - the constant barrage of tabloid TV coverage - are crushingly obvious. Affleck is smoothly proficient but (this is probably Finchers failing) skimps the darker shades that might have flipped this film from melodrama to drama.  Pike is riveting without being altogether interesting. She holds the screen with her beautful blankness. A few of the supporting players including Kim Dickens as a suspicious local cop and Carrie Coon as Nicks twin sister move beyond the formulaic which is more than can be said for the movie.

Readers of Gillian Flynns 2012 scorching best-seller about a wife gone missing and a husband suspected of a violent deed know that it begins as one sort of beast then cleverly gives way to another kind. That with his-and-her chapters it twists and turns every few pages. Actually ""gives way"" is too passive a description of the force of Flynns prose. This unfolding crime drama -- or is its a marital expose? -- directed by David Fincher gets as willfully muddy as the Mississippi River that rambles past the recession-bled town of North Carthage Mo. It is July 5 Nick Dunne and Amy Elliott Dunnes fifth wedding anniversary. Nick has departed from their home for the bar he and sis Margo or Go (a terrific Carrie Coon) own. When a neighbors phone call has him hurry back home he finds his wife (Rosamund Pike) missing. Theirs was a young marriage that didnt even make it to the ""seven-year itch"" before becoming drenched with intertwined hatred. Contempt is the storys fuel. There are heaps of derision and also a lot of blood. Traces of Amys glow bright after crime-scene cops apply Luminol. Kim Dickens does ace work as the suspicious but thorough Detective. Rhonda Boney charged with the missing-persons case. Readers also know Flynns book was an impressively nasty piece of work full of biting observations about romantic love and its failings ambition and its upending parental expectation and exploitation. Amys parents made a bundle with a childrens book series featuring the daughters avatar the Amazing Amy. Adapted by Flynn ""Gone Girl"" opened the New York Film Festival recently. Even so the praise bestowed on what is chiefly an engaging entertainment seems less an accurate verdict on the films quality than a sign of how far weve come from having grown-up movies on a regular basis. Ben Affleck does deft work as Nick Dunne. When the mens-mag writer loses his gig he relocates to his hometown in Missouri with New York City girl Amy to help his sister with their dying mother and bitter Alzheimers-wrecked father. Missouri loves company as they say. Amy she of the once-hefty trust fund joins him. Not so happily. There are unreliable spouses and unreliable narrators of the first order. Nick is a husband with something to hide. Amys diary starts chipper and romance-smeared before morph-ing into a journal of fear and a damning piece of evidence. For many Amy will serve as Pikes introduction to movie audiences. Too bad. Shes been sharper elsewhere but this Amy feels too chilly to seduce us. And we have to be somewhat taken no? ""Gone Girl"" is well made. To a point. The final third becomes mildly absurd. By that time we were hooked if annoyed. On its way to its twisted conclusion ""Gone Girl"" forgoes many of the finer tussles set up by the novel. The book maneuvers marital contempt but also the emotional wreckage of economic booms and busts. There are moments of moody filmmaking of the sort we expect from the director of ""The Social Network"" ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" and "" Zodiac."" The image -- amusing chilling -- of Nick sitting in a chair in his and Amys beige and tan- square-footage-greedy house stroking their tabby cat is perfect. And Fincher gets at our lemming-like response to news stories about lovely blond victims lost to violence. But by now onscreen Nancy Grace riffs have their own lemming-like feel. Still it was nice to see Sela Ward as a TV personality nabbing an exclusive interview with the much-reviled Nick. As the defense attorney with the 100000 retainer Tyler Perry provides a strange bit of bemused comic relief. Not all the casting is spot-on. Neil Patrick Harris comes with too idiosyncratic a profile to convince as Amys former high school boyfriend and moneyed stalker. What was finessed in Flynns novel becomes a cheat here because (spoiler alert) madness so often is in movies. ""Crazy"" eludes a certain narrative richness. Come the end you may recall two fantasy women who invited cries of misogyny but also loads of perverse fondness at least on the part of this reviewer Catherine Tramell of ""Basic Instinct"" and before her Alex Forrest of ""Fatal Attraction."" Still once you release the movie from the demand that it be significant there are a number of achievements. Not nearly enough to make the movie enduring or even a particularly worthy conversation-starter about Men Women Marriage. For that theres always the book.

Adapted from Gillian Flynns 2012 mega best-seller David Finchers tense chiller unspools like a large intestine being slowly unraveled each turn a little more gut wrenching than the last.Its also a darkly humorous ride and a compulsively watchable indictment on marriage the media and American life. Its one of the years best movies and will make for one of the most awkward date night smashes to come along in some time.The storys zigs and zags are too delicious to give away which makes discussing the movie difficult. Without revealing too much it centers on the love story between Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) and his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike absolutely on fire) who move back to Nicks hometown along the Mississippi River after theyre both laid off from their magazine jobs in New York following the 2008 recession.Their story begins as a fairy tale Nick kissing Amy in an alley where a bakery is receiving its late night delivery powdered sugar lightly dancing in the air. But their spark soon dulls and they settle into a slovenly routine him sprawled out on the couch playing video games her wondering what her place is in this Missouri town.Whats next a baby? Divorce? Neither are viable options especially not for Amy an overachiever whose parents have loosely modeled an ongoing series of popular childrens books -- dubbed ""Amazing Amy"" -- on her life. And then on the morning of her and Nicks fifth wedding anniversary Amy vanishes signs of a struggle all over their tidy McMansion. Nick calls the cops but as the story unfolds he becomes more and more of a suspect in her disappearance. And when a Nancy Grace-type gets a hold of the story and turns it into a media sensation Nick becomes the scourge of the nation.To say much more isnt fair but thats really only the beginning and ""Gone Girls"" two and-a-half hour running time flies by like an especially gripping episode of ""Dateline NBC."" The cast is uniformly excellent with Affleck turning in career-best work that calls on him to be equal parts charming and smarmy in control and in over his head. Even if his pre-Batman bulk makes him a little too physically imposing hes a powerhouse. But its Pike (""Jack Reacher"") who really stands out in a star-making turn that she bites into and shreds apart. Its a difficult role requiring a deft balance of softness fury and carnal instinct and Pike nails it.Going deeper Tyler Perry is electrifying as Nicks showboat lawyer Tanner Bolt revealing the nuanced character actor that lies beneath the Madea wig. Neil Patrick Harris is slick and weaselly as one of Amys exes and Kim Dickens and Patrick Fugit are dynamite as the hometown cops investigating the case. And the great Scoot McNairy in a bit role as a man who once crossed paths with Amy leaves a lasting impression.Fincher working from Flynns script handles the story with a measured grace and unleashes exactly two virtuosic sequences one midway through the film that turns everything in the story on its axis the other a late inning squirmer that pushes the boundaries of the films R-rating and will have many moviegoers ducking for cover. Meanwhile the score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross -- they won an Oscar for their work on Finchers ""The Social Network"" soundtrack -- keeps the tension high and the dread mounting throughout.""Gone Girl"" has big things on its brain namely about the ritual of marriage and what it does to people over time. Its sick fun that leaves a scar; popcorn entertainment that bites back.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 03 2014 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Oct. 03 2014 911AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by David Fincher Written by Gillian Flynn Starring Rosamund Pike and Ben Affleck Classification 14A Country USA Language English Isnt that smart? A New England kind of word of sensible harmonious things like matching appliances button-down shirts and A-line skirts. Its also the take-away word from David Finchers new film Gone Girl a chic and perverse take on modern marriage in the guise of a thriller. The premise of the film adapted for the screen by Gillian Flynn from her own hit novel resembles most episodes of the current-affairs show 48 Hours Theres a happy couple that seems to have it all - then the wife mysteriously disappears. Next come the revelations of marital alienation financial problems erratic behaviour the troubling forensic report and ... uh-oh. Video Video Globe film critic Liam Lacey explains why genius casting makes Gone Girl a must-watch flick Heres another word for Gone Girl ""meta."" Its a word Flynn uses which means its a thriller about thrillers and a narrative about narratives especially the form of domestic violence relished by current-affairs television shows. (To quote Elvis Costellos The Long Honeymoon ""All the movies and the papers feature the murders of lonely women."")While this persistent cleverness keeps Gone Girl at a simmer instead of a boil fans of Flynns 2012 novel will not be one tiny bit disappointed. Rumours of substantial changes are untrue. The author has adroitly adapted her own screenplay cutting out the padding and maintaining the books time-shifting he-said/she-said structure and brittle wit.For the Fincher cult Gone Girl offers the usual grisly absurdism under a domestic guise. Though not as psychologically dark as Se7en Fight Club and Zodiac the movie has more bite than his other mainstream efforts (The Curious Case of Benjamin Button The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and Netflix series House of Cards). Gone Girls closest ally in Finchers oeuvre is the Howard Hawksian screwball comedy The Social Network which is similarly funny and cuttingly sharp in its examination of everyday sociopathology.The story is supercontemporary. Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) is a laid-off New York movie magazine writer (as was Flynn who used to write for Entertainment Weekly) while his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) loses her hobby job writing quizzes in womens magazines and their perfect Manhattan life becomes unsustainable. They move back to Nicks hometown of North Carthage Mo. a heartland community with a dwindling pulse and the Dunnes as a couple are done-for inhabiting a beige monster home in an underpopulated post-crash subdivision.Along with his twin sister and soulmate Margo (Carrie Coon) Nick opens a bar called ""the Bar"" a name that they think of as ""meta."" Nick is the kind of disenchanted husband who would call his wife ""the Wife"" and his relationship ""the Marriage."" Behind the glossy magazine cover of the once-perfect couple theres a cracked plaster wall over a bulging sewage pipe of resentments.Amy a New York trust-fund princess of a wife (her parents made a fortune writing a series of childrens books entitled Amazing Amy) is traumatized by her Cinderella-in-reverse transition. Throughout the electronic score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross grinds squawks and groans communicating the rising panic beneath the placid surface.The Dunnes marital dissonance is no doubt a metaphor of Americas post-2008 economic disillusionment which is not to say Gone Girl is exactly social realism. This is very much a movie to be considered to be admired like the elegant complexity of the gear train of a vintage watch.The story shifts between the rich-hued romance-novel past of New York and the washed-out present of Missouri between Nicks and Amys points of view. There is also a series of handwritten clues that Amy leaves as part of her anniversary treasure hunt serving as a mystery within the mystery. As well there are recognizable tropes from film-noir classics (Laura Double Indemnity) that movie journalist Nick should pick up on.The action begins on Nick and Amys fifth wedding anniversary in somewhat unorthodox fashion. Nick comes home from an afternoon visit to the Bar where he has dropped in to see his sister and slosh down some bourbon. The cat is on the step. His front door is open his wife gone and the coffee table smashed. A couple of small-town cops arrive Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) and Officer Jim Gilpin (Patrick Fugit) who find blood smears. They are chatty and helpful. They recommend a news conference the next morning attended by Amys parents but Nick hungover and awkward offers a creepily inappropriate smile for the cameras. The initial wave of sympathy that engulfs Nick soon begins to wane. A Nancy Grace-style TV poisonality (Missi Pyle) gets on his case. Nicks evasive behaviour raises suspicions and then Amys diary is discovered.Even audiences who havent read Flynns bestseller will be primed for a twist which comes quickly - at the one-hour mark in this 145-minute film. Theres not much more that can be revealed except that a pivotal role is played by someone from Amys past a rich fastidious sexually ambiguous former private-school boyfriend who turned into a stalker named Desi Collings (Neil Patrick Harris). The character of Desi is cartoonish but then the entire movie grows increasingly heightened tipping into a Pedro Almodovar level of camp melodrama.Melodrama thriller comedy and social commentary Yes this is one ingenious contraption of a movie. If theres one area where Gone Girl is brilliant its in its casting. Affleck and Pike who superficially seem as blandly pretty as the Dunnes McMansion are full of surprises. Afflecks handsome mug and shifty uneasy manner have never been better suited to a role. Nick wavers somewhere between emotional foundering and soullessness. The pretty English actress Pike whose range has extended from the decorative (Barneys Version) to slyly amusing (An Education) is a revelation (though the details cant be revealed here) as a character of near-mythic self-absorption. The exceptional casting choices go right down the line. Coon a Broadway actress (shes married to playwright Tracy Letts) is another strong candidate for MVP here as Nicks wry compulsively honest tomboy sister with a bit of a crush on her brother. (Theres something of Barbara Bel Geddess character Midge in Vertigo in her performance.) The biggest surprise? Tyler Perry as an ebulliently mischievous amoral celebrity defence attorney. Not to forget Dickens as a folksy smart cop and Fugit as her skeptical partner whose performances are so precisely understated that the humour is only fully appreciated in retrospect.Indeed the attention to casting is the best argument against charges of misanthropy and misogyny in Gone Girl. With the exception of the ridiculous Desi no one in the story is simply a reductive type. Every character in the film starting with Nick and Amy suggests an entire hidden world capacious complicated and unnervingly unpredictable.

"Gone Girl | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; gone-girl ) Gone Girl (United States 2014) October 02 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli Early every autumn theres one excellent studio movie released - a way to kick off the Oscar race and remind adult viewers that its still possible to find intelligent compelling movies in theaters. In 2014 that film is Gone Girl Gillian Flynns adaptation of her own best-selling novel brought to the screen under the capable guidance of A-list director David Fincher. Fincher whos no stranger to dark material (Seven and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo being examples) understands how to get the most out of Gone Girl and the result is 145 minutes of riveting drama and surprises. And although the movie doesnt represent a page-by-page recreation of the book it captures key aspects including multiple (sometimes unreliable) narrative perspectives commentary on what ""guilt"" and ""popularity"" mean in todays media-saturated culture and (of course) a Hitchcock-tilted storyline seeded with twists and turns. This review will steer as clear as possible from spoilers but if you havent read the novel you may want to stop here. The more fresh the experience the better. Even a stripped-down synopsis of the premise could inadvertently give away things the uninitiated viewer might prefer to discover on his or her own. (Those who are familiar with the book are safe because although there are some changes the overall arc tracks closely to that of the novel which is what one would expect when the author is also the screenwriter.) If theres an overriding theme in Gone Girl its one of manipulation. Characters manipulate other characters. The media manipulates how the public thinks and lawyers and victims manipulate the media. Fincher isnt telling us anything new but hes reminding us how little concepts like ""guilt"" and ""innocence"" mean in the court of public opinion when the facts are twisted handled and withheld to make the story more compelling. The main narrative concerns the disappearance of a woman and the mystery surrounding what happened to her. The first half of Gone Girl switches back and forth between the perspective of the seemingly distraught husband Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) as he searches for his missing wife and that of the woman Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) in entries from a diary. Amys contributions provide background while Nicks segments propel the story forward. The question about Nick is whether hes just a boorish husband with a lot of skeletons in his closet or whether hes hiding something more sinister. Around the midpoint Fincher shifts to a neutral perspective and the narrative slides into Basic Instinct territory complete with unconventional sex and copious amounts of blood. Paul Verhoeven would approve. It can be difficult for any film to get two key aspects of Gone Girl right unreliable narration and multiple perspectives. One need look no further than The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby to understand how a directors intentions arent always conveyed. With Gone Girl however Fincher succeeds against all odds. By the time the end credits roll we have a clear picture of what did (and didnt) transpire. By intention Gone Girl feels like two different movies grafted together. The first half is more cerebral and closer to a police procedural. Nick jokingly refers to an episode of Law amp; Order and theres some truth to the comparison although the movie is crafted at a higher level than the write-by-numbers standards of a weekly TV series. The Basic Instinct similarities are amplified during the second half which features a wealth of lurid material. There are some minor pacing issues toward the very end when the movie perhaps overstays its welcome by a few minutes. Ben Affleck provides a capable anchor in much the same way Kevin Costner did in his films two-plus decades ago. From an acting standpoint there are two notable performances. Rosamund Pike gives what may be a career turn as Amy. Considering how the story develops shes a little like Tatiana Maslany in Orphan Black - playing multiple iterations of the same individual each with subtle variations. Then theres Tyler Perry who is a perfect fit for the role of the high-profile defense lawyer. Its refreshing to see Perry step out of his niche and show he can play someone other than Madea. Neil Patrick Harris (as Amys creepy first boyfriend) Carrie Coon (Nicks sister) Kim Dickens (the lead detective) and Missi Pyle (a Nancy Grace-inspired TV talk show host) are all solid in supporting roles. Even the best thrillers often follow predictable trajectories regardless of how many narrative switchbacks and red herrings they employ. Although some of what happens in Gone Girl is expected the progression of the storyline is at times so inventive that it doesnt matter whether all the traditional surprises work. Fincher and Flynn recognize theyre not going to be able to shock viewers with every twist so they allow us to guess some things in order to keep others hidden. Gone Girl is a rare movie a delicious thriller that provides plenty of titillation and gruesome pleasure while offering a dollop of social commentary. Its smart twisted bloody and almost guaranteed to satisfy anyone with a penchant for the macabre.

The film based on the best-selling novel will ... more Photo Merrick Morton Associated Press Gone Girl review thrilling until its not 1 / 5 Back to Gallery ""Gone Girl"" is a great thriller until it stops being one about 20 minutes before the finish. Until then its brilliant not just a triumph of story but of strategy a movie that keeps the audience grasping and reaching in all the wrong directions while consistently delivering something a little better a little crazier and a little more disturbing than expected. And then before its over it all kind of goes ... not to hell -- its not as bad as that -- but to purgatory or limbo. This most satisfying of films turns dissatisfying. This Swiss watch of storytelling turns into a bad digital clock circa 1986 flashing the wrong numbers. If only the dip in quality came in the middle or even at the beginning we might still be able to class ""Gone Girl"" as among the years best. But when a movie in its final minutes forsakes its own logic and embraces false cleverness that cant be ignored. ""Gone Girl"" is based on Gillian Flynns enormously popular novel of the same name and the novels very popularity might be the main problem here. There are things that can work in print that just cant be made to work onscreen. Yet when its an acclaimed story that half the audience will know going in no broad changes can be considered even ones for the better. Does this all sound vague? Alas were going to have to hover in the Land of Vague in discussing ""Gone Girl"" because this is just one of those movies Give away too much of the story and youve just killed about three-quarters of its appeal. Story of marriage So well stay general. ""Gone Girl"" is the story of a marriage as well as a pretty straight-faced satire -- or is it an indictment? -- of the way gossip is passed off as news on cable television. Ben Affleck plays Nick a guy with a cloud of sadness around him who goes home to find that his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) is missing and that there are signs of a struggle. He calls the police who being cops start suspecting him of murder. But who knows? This time they could be right. For the first hour ""Gone Girl"" takes place on two tracks. It follows Nick in the present day as he becomes the center of both the investigation and of the medias piranha-like lust. And it goes back in time telling the tale of Nick and Amys courtship and marriage as related (and narrated) by Amy in her diary. Juicy roles Affleck has had good roles before but I dont think he has ever had one that capitalizes on as much of what he can do onscreen. He is a big slab of a guy but his aura is not of strength but of uncertainty perhaps moral weakness. He is instantly likable and then occasionally upon reflection dislikable. He has a blitheness that is either amusing or engaging or off-putting depending on the viewers angle. He can just as easily charm the world as irritate millions -- he has literally done both in real life -- so anybodys reaction to him is easy to believe so long as its extreme. Rosamund Pike will come as more of a surprise. Her previous roles have hinted at her intelligence and ability -- she even made audiences believe she was in love with a cigar-chomping Paul Giamatti in ""Barneys Version"" -- but this is the juiciest role she has had to date and she makes a meal of it. Everyone who sees ""Gone Girl"" will walk out raving about Rosamund Pike. Director David Fincher lands a tone for ""Gone Girl"" thats broad and precise enough to encourage a series of witty performances within the thriller framework. The story may be the star here but everyone is vivid within it not just the principals but Kim Dickens as a detective Tyler Perry as a hotshot lawyer and Carrie Coon as Afflecks twin sister. And then it all sort of ... ""implodes"" would be too strong a word. Perhaps ""frays?"" ""Becomes dented?"" ""Loses its glow?"" But thats all in the last 20 minutes.

Photo Merrick Morton MORE FROM Lou Lumenick Lights Out is a freaky mother-daughter ghost story Bryan Cranston and drugs -- together again in The Infiltrator Captain Fantastic is one of the years best movies A gorgeous starlet an ugly death - and a White House scandal Spielbergs BFG does Dahl right MOVIE REVIEW Gone Girl Chasing Amy. Running time 145 minutes. Rated R (gory violence sex/nudity profanity). At the Ziegfeld the Empire others. David Finchers ""Gone Girl is a glossy empty and ultimately unsatisfying -- if undeniably entertaining -- movie about a writer (Ben Affleck) who becomes a murder suspect after his beautiful blond wife (Rosamund Pike) disappears on their fifth wedding anniversary. Working from Gillian Flynns own adaptation of her best-selling novel Finchers all over the place with a movie that tries with varying degrees of success to be a melodramatic thriller a media satire and some sort of commentary on the state of marriage after the 2008 stock market crash. Fincher has been deft at mixing tones in such masterpieces as ""The Social Network and ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button but badly stumbles at the outset of his new film when Afflecks Nick Dunne discovers a smashed glass table and a smear of blood in the home he shares with his wife Amy (Pike). The audience is supposed to be guessing about Nicks guilt until a ""surprise revelation an hour in. I wont give it away but Nicks initial reaction -- not to mention Amys archly delivered self-serving narration -- pretty much gives away the game throwing the audiences sympathy to Nick. Not that either one of them is a terribly likable character -- in Pikes rather frosty performance in flashbacks Amy comes off as an entitled manipulator nursing huge grudges against her parents (authors who based a best-selling series of ""Amazing Amy books on an idealized version of her) and men in general. Nick is equally self-absorbed selfish and distant with his wife -- especially after the market crash and his mothers cancer force them to move to his hometown St. Louis where they still manage to afford a rental house worthy of Architectural Digest. Ben Affleck plays a distant husband whos suddenly cast into the spotlight when his wife (Rosamund Pike) goes missing.Photo Merrick Morton The police detective on the case (a superb Kim Dickens) has a hard time charging Nick when theres no body to be found but Nick -- led by scavenger-hunt clues left behind by Amy -- obliges by doing so many stupid things to incriminate himself you wonder how he held down his previous job as a magazine writer in New York. Before long Nicks gone from the concerned husband worried about his missing spouse to ""the most hated man in America -- not a huge stretch for Affleck who during his Bennifer era was the most mocked man in America since O.J. Simpson. Nick (Ben Affleck) consults his defense attorney Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry) in ""Gone Girl.""Photo Merrick Morton Enter a celebrity lawyer named Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry) as well as tabloid journalists loosely modeled on Nancy Grace (Missi Pyle) and Barbara Walters (Sela Ward). Not exactly biting satire or social commentary. Fincher is on more solid ground with trashy thrills -- including an artfully staged (and gory) murder reminiscent of Brian De Palma. Besides Dickens the other standout in the large cast is Carrie Coon as Nicks loyal sister Margo who with him runs a bar owned by Amy. You end up caring about the cop and the sister a lot more than Nick and Amy. Neil Patrick Harris camps it up a bit as a creepy former admirer of Amys while Scoot McNairy nails a one-scene cameo as a man who deeply regrets ever having crossed her path. Emily Ratajkowski of the notorious ""Blurred Lines music video pops up as a sexy student of Nicks. Its hard to make a full case for my problems with ""Gone Girl without getting into spoiler territory so I wont for now. Lets just say this is the sort of having-your-cake-and-eating-it-too ""date movie"" loaded with fantasies designed to appeal equally to both feminists and misogynists.

October 2 2014 -- 712pm Video (0249)  ""Gone Girl"" sketches characters of brazen amorality and compromise in their attempts to be players in the normal world. ""Left Behind"" is where the end of the world is a cheesy-looking bore. ""Annabelle"" quickly devolves into derivative predictability. David Brewster Star Tribune Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Graydon Royce graydonroyce Nick Dunne is having a bad day. Hes at loose ends chugging a late-morning bourbon at the tavern he owns dreading the conversation he needs to have with his wife Amy on this their fifth wedding anniversary. Returning home he finds the door ajar a table smashed and his wife missing. If you have read the bestselling novel ""Gone Girl"" you know that Nicks bad day will get much worse spiraling down the rabbit hole into a nightmarish crash. For those unfamiliar with Gillian Flynns torrid page turner David Finchers new film (with a screenplay adapted by Flynn) quite faithfully spools out the pulpy details of a story that constantly reinvents itself. Buckle up because its going to be a bumpy ride. Fincher (""Benjamin Button"" ""Social Network"") rises to the mood and imagery of this chiaroscuro portrait. Frequent collaborator Trent Reznor (Nine Inch Nails) colors in Finchers vision with a tense soundscape. Finchers eye falls on Flynns story in a style not unlike his vision for ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo."" His camera is blunt and unsentimental his lighting schemes claustrophobic and his editing clipped. Flynns great accomplishment in her book and here is an unstinting dedication to plot mechanics that jar our balance. We are never allowed to settle into a single reality in this scheme invented from illusion perception lies counter-lies and a small universe that spins out of control. Fincher uses simplicity in letting complications speak for themselves. The languid moment or sentimental gloss is rare. When they lose their jobs in the 2008 recession Nick and Amy leave New York and end up in Nicks hometown in Missouri underemployed. As Nick Ben Afflecks brawny chest heaves with dissatisfaction as he considers his life in the bland brick home they are renting. Affleck who can seem self-important reading the phone book here has a character who pushes the actor into the panic zone. The early confidence that things will work out becomes an illusion as circumstances wash away the underpinnings of his reality. 20th Century Fox Rosamund Pike (with Ben Affleck) comes to the forefront in ""Gone Girl."" Rosamund Pike whose face photographs like a work of art brings more than her natural beauty to Amy Dunne onetime subject of the ""Amazing Amy"" childhood books penned by her parents. Fincher pushes Pike in new directions and the actor reveals a new dimension. Pikes Amy attracts drama thrives on danger and carries the story as it evolves in real time and flashbacks. After Amy vanishes Nick finds comfort in the steady common sense and counsel of his sister (Carrie Coon) and a sympathetic detective (Kim Dickens) who gives him every benefit of the doubt. These two in particular provide real-life balance to the unreal world inhabited by Nick and Amy. Some of the hype over ""Gone Girl"" has focused on the media circus that descends on Nick after Amys absence grows into days. (""Gosh look how terrible we are"") Missy Kyle channels a Nancy Grace-style cable host who fans the flames but the trope has the heavy air of cliche. More interesting is work of Tyler Perry (good to see him back in mens clothing) contributing substance as a high-profile and savvy lawyer brought in by Nick. Neil Patrick Harris kicks in a small but important performance as a rich and emotionally stunted playboy. ""Gone Girl"" goes beyond the mere decay of a marriage. Finchers film sketches characters of brazen amorality and compromises -- sane in appearance but ultimately insane -- in their attempts to be players in the normal world. Or its just a twisty ride on the roller coaster of suspense and illusion. Nothing wrong with that. Graydon Royce has been in love with theater ever since he portrayed Crusher Mad Dog Vachon and Wally Karbo to frenzied applause in the 6th grade talent show at Hilltop Elementary School. His most embarrassing moment in life was a dance audition at Chanhassen Dinner Theatre in 1974. So many steps so few feet. Now he just likes to watch.

By CHRIS VOGNAR Follow chrisvognar cvognardallasnews.com Movie Critic Published 02 October 2014 0214 PM Updated 03 October 2014 0140 PM Related The Good Lie tells the powerful story of Sudans Lost Boys (B) Preschoolers are the target audience for The Hero of Color City (C+) Dull remake of Left Behind lacks edge and mystery Expect to be taken on a wild magical ride in 20000 Days on Earth (B+) Few surprises but plenty of screams in Annabelle (C) Heist film Drive Hard is laced with some laughs (C) The unreliable narrator is a reliable literary gambit guiding everything from Ring Lardners classic short story ""Haircut"" to Gillian Flynns best-selling thriller Gone Girl. Now Flynn has adapted her novel for the screen and with the help of director David Fincher she turns the books game of misdirection into a mischievous high-wire act. This is mass-market filmmaking of unusual confidence and skill.Gliding from the too-enraptured romantic diary entries of a missing woman (Rosamund Pike) to the too-glib panic of her suspected husband (Ben Affleck) Gone Girl creates the sensation of midair suspension in a dark mordantly funny world. The effect is particularly potent in the movies first half as Gone Girl leads us on and practically pushes us forward in our seats happily wondering exactly where were heading.Amys diary portrays her marriage to Nick as a fairy tale that slowly curdled. The sex was great (and Fincher doesnt flinch from it). Nicks down-to-earth charm whisked his bride away from her controlling parents who made her the heroine in a series of childrens books. Then Nick and Amy moved from exciting New York to suburban Missouri to care for Nicks ailing mom and the husband grew violent. Fincher captures the marriages tonal shift largely through increasing shadow as the diary reveals an unraveling. But diaries of course have authors and authors tend to have their own motives.Pike and Affleck are perfectly cast. Shes a femme fatale a blond noir woman with dagger eyes and Pike envelops herself in a constantly shifting role. Affleck criticized in the past as too charming for his own good plays up that quality and makes Nick both callow and sympathetic. Gone Girl thrives on enigma and the leads embody that quality to wonderful effect.The sense of mystery wanes a little in the second half as the gone girls whereabouts crystallize. But soon a different kind of pleasure takes over a jagged anatomy of a scheme that makes way for some pointed news-media satire. (Missi Pyle steals scenes as a Nancy Grace-style cable-TV crusader for justice headlines and self-righteous thrills.) Fincher understands what Flynn is after here a tricky blend of crime thriller and domestic observation with a wit that grows sharper with each passing scene.All marriages demand compromise. In this one the compromises are moral and as they come into focus corrupted. Gone Girl has wicked fun arriving at this point and keeps its destination enshrouded in darkness. We begin the movie thinking Amy and Nick are made for each other. Thats also where we end but by then Gone Girls sardonic laugh is ready to follow us out of the theater.GONE GIRL (A-)Directed by David Fincher.

Photo Credit Merrick Morton advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT In a small Missouri town a husband stands accused of murdering his wife. Rated R for violence nudity sexual situations language. BOTTOM LINE Gillian Flynns playful novel is now David Finchers chilling movie. Still packed with twists and turns but the overall effect is unsettling. CAST Ben Affleck Rosamund Pike Neil Patrick Harris LENGTH 229 Gillian Flynns ""Gone Girl"" was 2012s hippest piece of airport fiction. Its protagonists are two New York City journalists Nick and Amy Dunne whose super-sexy marriage turns so ugly that after Amy vanishes Nick is suspected of killing her -- and becomes an overnight celebrity. Narrated from both spouses unreliable viewpoints ""Gone Girl"" zigzags through a media-crazed hall of mirrors in which public perception becomes more important than truth. The whole book was smart wickedly funny and very ""now."" David Finchers screen version is a deeper darker experience. On the surface its beautiful a Hollywood noir aglow with two exceptionally gorgeous stars Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike and the lush cinematography of Jeff Cronenweth. Underneath however lurks an evil that comes into focus only during the films final act. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Who was the Sons of Anarchy Homeless Woman? The less said about plot the better since ""Gone Girl"" has more twists than a pack of Twizzlers. (Flynn wrote the screenplay.) At any rate its the characters that make this story so vivid. Affleck is perfect as the handsome hapless Nick while Pike is dazzling as Amy a Manhattanite withering away in dreary Carthage Missouri. There Nick and his twin sister Margo (an excellent Carrie Coon in her feature debut) start a bar called The Bar. ""Love the name"" says Rhonda Boney a ""Fargo""-esque cop played by Kim Dickens. ""Very meta."" Nick has also become meta. Like the actor who plays him hes a public figure and fair game for ignorant judgments. Women rate him (creepy or hot?) men bristle at him television journalists prey on him. (Missi Pyle plays a barely disguised version of Nancy Grace; Sela Ward is a vampiric interviewer named Sharon Schieber.) Two unexpectedly good performances come from Tyler Perry as Nicks glib defense lawyer and Neil Patrick Harris as Amys slightly strange ex-lover. Flynns novel found wry humor in our 24/7 media culture but for Fincher (""The Social Network"" ""Se7en"") its a horror show. Even more upsetting than this movies blood-splattered crescendo (Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross Finchers go-to composers have never delivered a more haunting score) is this movies quietly chilling conclusion. By then reality no longer matters at all. 137 MoviesGone Girl trailer PLOT In a small Missouri town a husband stands accused of murdering his wife. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING R (violence nudity sexual situations language) CAST Ben Affleck Rosamund Pike Neil Patrick Harris LENGTH 229 BOTTOM LINE Gillian Flynns playful novel is now David Finchers chilling movie.

His oeuvre spans sci-fi (""Alien 3"") fantasy (""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"") and fact-based drama (""The Social Network""). But his consistently best work may be in dark crime dramas. ""SEVEN"" (1995) Finchers memorably disturbing second feature as a director after a career in commercials and music video found Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman investigating deranged mastermind Kevin Spacey whose string of murders reflects the Seven Deadly Sins.

Gone Girl (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Gone Girl (R) Gillian Flynns bestselling mystery makes for a smashing thriller. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com10/2/2014 Editor rating 3 On his fifth wedding anniversary Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) gets a call from his neighbor saying his front door is ajar. Nick goes home to investigate and finds a crime scene Broken furniture shattered glass traces of blood. Most importantly there is no trace of his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike). The police immediately suspect the husband the way they usually do in such cases. But Nick who owns a bar in Missouri with his sister seems like an unlikely candidate to have committed the crime. The audience -- and the media --are on his side and a news frenzy begins in the hope someone knows Amys whereabouts. Thats the set-up for Gone Girl which was directed by David Fincher (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) and adapted from her own novel by Gillian Flynn. As the movie initially goes through the usual paces -- forensics experts are called in; Nick is interrogated; his past is investigated -- the picture feels like a superbly made tony whodunnit. Finchers camera is restrained but precise He fills rooms with sharp angles and straight lines giving the film a somewhat antiseptic feel but as Nick tries to keep it together under the mounting pressure of the search a feeling of dread sneaks into the movie. Clearly theres more going on here than were being shown. The film is split between the present and the past when Nick and Amy first met in New York City and married living a comfortable life as magazine journalists. She kept a diary which we hear in voiceover talking about how happy she is and how lucky she was to meet Nick. Meanwhile in Missouri small pieces of suspicious evidence start to pop up that while not enough to make a substantial case keep the cops trained on Nick (Almost Famous Patrick Fugit is particularly good as a cop who doesnt say much but takes in everything his eyes telling you what hes thinking). Eventually although he continues to proclaim his innocence Nick is forced to hire a lawyer (Tyler Perry). Each day that Amy remains missing makes her husband seem more guilty. Gone Girl would have been perfectly satisfying as a straightforward missing-person thriller with some unexpected turns of plot. But Fincher and Flynn want to dig deeper. What happens to a storybook marriage when the spouses grow up and change? How much do we take for granted about the people we think we know inside-out? How much of our lives consist of decisions based on material values and our pursuit of the perfect American dream? In todays 24/7 media climate how easily can hearts and minds be swayed? Although it runs almost 21/2 hours Gone Girl zips by because the movie keeps changing the game on you. The film doesnt pack the same punch the book did but thats more a matter of the medium than the material (this is with a couple of minor changes one of the most faithful movie adaptations ever made). Affleck who has more experience than most people at living (and surviving) media scandals grounds Nick in a befuddled confusion He does everything hes told to do until like anyone else he starts to lose his patience. Pike is a revelation as the gorgeous smart wife whose diary entries are the work of a romantic in love yet is still capable of flashing scary signs of displeasure when shes unhappy. Theyre a perfect couple at least from the outside and Fincher shows a new flair for burrowing deep into domestic life and relationships without a serial killer or monster lurking (although he does pull off one operatically bloody murder; you can almost see him smile behind the camera during the scene). The less you know about Gone Girl going in the better but even knowing whats ahead doesnt prepare you for the movies tone which is funny yet curdled and cynical and bleak. This is a satirical antidote to the feel-good pap most Hollywood movies about relationships push on their audiences - the perfect date movie for someone you want to break up with.

Comments click to enlarge Gone Girl Video Rated R  149 minutes  2014 Gillian Flynns twist-laden mystery novel gets a somber respectful screen treatment from David Fincher (The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo The Social Network) which has the unfortunate effect of diminishing the books diabolical fun and heightening its dull misanthropy. In small-town Missouri a local man (Ben Affleck) becomes a murder suspect after his cool-blond New Yorker wife (Rosamund Pike) goes missing; the usual media circus follows but appearances are deceiving. Even at two and a half hours the movie is terminally overplotted and the two leads both sink under the weight of their selfish spiteful characters. But there are strong supporting performances from Carrie Coon as the husbands loyal sister and Kim Dickens as the shrewd police detective investigating the case. Flynn wrote the script; with Neil Patrick Harris Tyler Perry and Patrick Fugit. By J.R.

"David Finchers Gone Girl starring Ben Affleck reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Gone Girl the Movie Is More Complex and Richly Problematic Than the Book Gone Girl the Movie Is More Complex and Richly Problematic Than the Book Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Oct. 2 2014 1204 PM Gone Girl Beautiful sexy and fascinatingly mean. By Dana Stevens Rosamund Pike and Ben Affleck in Gone Girl. Photo by Merrick Morton/Twentieth Century Fox and Regency Enterprices After youve seen Gone Girl come back and listen to Slates David Haglund Dan Kois and Dana Stevens discuss the movie in our Spoiler Special.   David Finchers Gone Girl presents a succession of shimmering surfaces each more seductive and opaque than the last. Thats not the only way in which this film (adapted by Gillian Flynn from her own best-selling novel) could be said to resemble its title character the mysteriously missing Amy Elliott Dunne (Rosamund Pike). Amy is polished perfectionistic coolly cerebral and sometimes startlingly cruel. So is Finchers ninth film a deliciously manipulative mystery that toys with the viewer like a femme fatale with her prey. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Wait did I just compare a movie about a manipulative woman to a manipulative woman? Thats a pretty weird metaphor genderwise--and it only gets weirder when you observe that said movie while written by a woman is directed by a man who has often been criticized for making films that either ignore or objectify their female characters. And that the real protagonist of Gone Girl is not the missing Amy at all but her left-behind husband Nick (Ben Affleck) who is himself something of a closet misogynist. Whatever is going on with gender and sexuality in Gone Girl--and Im not sure I get just what is going on--its more complicated than simply ""man makes woman-hating movie."" But Ill stand by that femme fatale metaphor for now because at the most basic level it works Like a film noir siren Gone Girl is beautiful sexy and fascinatingly mean--a nasty but estimable piece of work. Advertisement Flynns novel--to which her script is broadly faithful with a few omissions and compressions--pivoted on a central twist around which Ill try to write loop-the-loops (though the ubiquity of that book on subway cars in the two years since its publication suggests many viewers will know it already). For me the book--spellbinding for the first hundred or so pages--lost much of its momentum after that reveal as the plot mechanisms clanked a little too audibly into gear. But Gone Girl the film is sleekly assembled and briskly paced feeling much shorter than its actual running time of 21/2 hours. And well after the big reveal (which comes around an hour into the film) there are many more skillfully executed rug-pulls to come. This may be one of those cases in which the adaptation surpasses the original Gone Girl the movie strikes me as more complex more suggestive and more problematic--richly so--than Gone Girl the book. Its a crime story that as with Finchers serial-killer movies (Seven Zodiac) is about something larger than the individual mystery it investigates. Questions of identity and representation knowability and unknowability truth and illusion are woven into the fabric of the plot not laid on top of it in the form of ""themes."" How to give a sense of that densely woven story without giving too much away? On the morning of Nick and Amy Dunnes fifth anniversary she disappears from their house in Nicks small Missouri hometown where theyve recently moved after the recession cut short their glamorous early years together as journalists in New York (a period Amy reconstructs for us breathlessly in a series of flashbacks narrating her own diary entries about their romantic courtship). Conditions in the Dunne house--a shattered glass coffee table flecks of blood on the kitchen wall--suggest an abduction or worse and two local detectives Boney (Kim Dickens) and Gilpin (Patrick Fugit) are called in to investigate. As the days go by and the hunt for Amy goes nowhere things begin to look bad for Nick. His alibi cant be corroborated his answers to the detectives questions sound slippery and his nervous grinning at a press conference does nothing to help his case. Soon the cable news shows have picked up on the story--after all were talking about a beautiful missing white woman here--and news vans surround Nicks house driving him to hole up at the home of his twin sister Margo (the very good Carrie Coon). Amys WASP-y parents (David Clennon and Lisa Banes) who fly in from the East Coast to help with the search soon grow suspicious of their son-in-law as well. The last hour and a half of Gone Girl can be talked about only elliptically for fear of spoilage but you are permitted to know that it involves Neil Patrick Harris as Amys rich ex and Tyler Perry as Nicks flashy seen-it-all lawyer. As the investigation and the flashbacks continue to drill down into Nick and Amys story their marriage gets examined and re-examined from both their perspectives; each successive chapter shows both partners in an ever less flattering light. Advertisement The simple fact of the bifurcated perspective--the two different versions of Amy and Nicks marriage we hear--makes for a formidable acting challenge for Affleck and Pike. They must play their characters at every moment as people who both might and might not be liars cheaters even killers. Affleck whom Ive never warmed to as an actor (I prefer him as a writer and director) is better than hes ever been--or maybe its just that this role is well-suited to his limitations as a thespian. Afflecks resting expression--a noncommittal averted-eye stare--has always communicated to me a vague sense of untrustworthiness. His Nick isnt a high-strung neurotic like the one in the novel but Affleck is more than buyable as a moderately intelligent lug resentfully aware that hes married above his station. And Pike--who for most of her time onscreen plays the eternally self-possessed Amy with a Hitchcock blondes icy refinement--turns what could have been a cliched woman-of-mystery role into a chance to show us the fragility of Amys cool-girl armor. Gone Girl looks and sounds sensational with elegant gray-and-green toned cinematography by longtime Fincher collaborator Jeff Cronenweth and an eerie (if a little too omnipresent) electronic score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross who also wrote the fine music for Finchers The Social Network. The link between eroticism and violence present beneath the surface throughout becomes explicit in one virtuosically filmed late sex scene thats gross graphic and horrifyingly gorgeous. Top Comment ""...the potential crime scene that lurks inside every marriage and measuring the frighteningly short distance between domestic detente and homicidal rage..."" Somewhere in Brooklyn Danas husband is reading this and chuckling nervously.  More... -The Silence of my Vagina Join In Theres no way to wade into the stickier wickets of Fincher and Flynns gender politics without giving away large chunks of the mystery plot. But there are moments several of them in which Nicks unsavory feelings about his complicated missing wife and about women in general--feelings that might be charitably summed up as ""bitches be crazy""--seem indistinguishable from the filmmakers own vision of Amy as a black hole of ineffable female needs moods and desires. Does this make Gone Girl a sexist movie? A movie about sexism that isnt fully in control of its tone? Or some unholy hybrid of the two? After two viewings in the space of one week Im still not sure where I come down on that question or on the tone of Gone Girls final scenes which cant quite sustain the novels ending note of ominous open-endedness and instead trail off in a few last bursts of ever-sourer irony. The very last shot though--a bookend to the very first in which we see the back of Amys head in close-up as Nick contemplates the fragility and shatter-ability of his wifes lovely skull--takes the film back to what it does best exploring the potential crime scene that lurks inside every marriage and measuring the frighteningly short distance between domestic detente and homicidal rage.

"Gone Girl both suspenseful and searing review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesGone Girl both suspenseful and searing reviewDavid Finchers Gone Girl takes Gillian Flynns book about a troubled marriage and turns it into a suspenseful indictment of modern times.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Oct. 2 2014Gone GirlStarring Ben Affleck Rosamund Pike Tyler Perry Neil Patrick Harris and Patrick Fugit. Directed by David Fincher. 149 minutes. Opens Friday at major theatres. 14ADavid Finchers Gone Girl takes a big beach read about a troubled marriage and turns it into a suspenseful screen indictment of modern times.Its a transformation of skill and daring both on Finchers part and that of author/screenwriter Gillian Flynn who ruthlessly pares her voluminous prose without sacrificing essential plot turns.Article Continued BelowAnd about those turns let this be said Fear not the careless clod or online troll who spills so-called plot spoilers. While you dont want to encourage such creatures theres so much more happening in this movie than simple narrative developments.Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike turn out to be a casting revelation as Nick and Amy in Gone Girl.  (Merrick Morton / 20th Century Fox)  RELATEDDavid Fincher hopes date night becomes fight night for Gone GirlIve seen Gone Girl twice (I also read the book) and I found the second viewing the more satisfying because I could forget about the ""who"" and ""how"" of the unhappy marital saga of Nick and Amy Dunne and concentrate more closely on the ""why.""And the why of Gone Girl is what makes it both a ripping yarn and a seriously thoughtful film one that seems likely to court Oscar attention from Best Picture on down.Its an excoriating examination of institutions under stress -- marriage the justice system the economy the media -- viewed with a jaded eye and a ruthless mind. As information is parceled out chances are youll find your assumptions and attitudes shifting and not just about the lives on screen.Fincher is great both at elevating potboilers (he also did so with The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo) and finding the deeper message within the social phenomenon (The Social Network Zodiac Fight Club).With Gone Girl he retains Flynns tricky dual-narrator format (which can get tedious) while cutting straight to the central mystery. On the day of her fifth wedding anniversary transplanted New York writer Amy (Rosamund Pike) suddenly disappears from the Missouri home she shares with her husband Nick (Ben Affleck) also a writer.There are signs of a scuffle but police investigators Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) and Jim Gilpin (Patrick Fugit) dont rush to judgment. A kidnapping (or worse) are possible but perhaps Amy just ran off. Maybe there was marital tension or personal depression. Amy and Nick moved to his hometown of North Carthage Mo. after being laid off from New York magazines but jobs (and dreams) are even scarcer in the sticks.The story soon breaks national because Amy is no ordinary missing person. Shes the inspiration for the can-do title heroine of Amazing Amy the popular series of childrens books penned by her psychologist parents Marybeth and Rand Elliott (Lisa Banes and David Clennon). As days pass with no sign of Amy town gossips and media weasels start observing that humble hubby Nick smiles too much and seems too relaxed for a guy who claims to be under siege.But as Gone Girl demonstrates so well who really knows anything about anybody? ""I dont even know if I believe the truth"" a character observes.Fincher and cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth (The Social Network Fight Club) feed the mystery with lighting and lensing that favour shadows and shallow focus and that demand close attention. Watch how skillfully they put into brief images Amys ""Cool Girl"" speech that runs long in the book.The score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross Oscar winners for The Social Network imparts a constant feeling of dread and distrust even though it often resembles something youd hear in a fairy tale -- or spa to use Finchers preferred comparison.Casting is the major revelation. Affleck and Pike may not have been the most likely suspects to play Nick and Amy but lightning struck twice and not just in the beauty department his desultory charm works perfectly against her patrician reserve.The choice of Madea actor/writer/director Tyler Perry to play celebrity defense attorney Tanner Bolt is nothing sort of divine intervention his easy smile hiding a sharks teeth. Also good are Neil Patrick Harris and Scoot McNairy as figures from Amys past.But you may remember Gone Girl best for its female roles of which there are more great ones than in a half dozen other recent movies. Besides Pikes enigmatic Amy and Dickens understated Det. Boney (shed be right at home with Fargos Marg Gunderson) there are also terrific performances by Carrie Coon as Nicks stalwart twin sister Margo and Missi Pyle and Sela Ward as scoop-chasing TV harpies.With all the serious stuff going on in Gone Girl it seems almost rude to observe that the film also has a lot of dark and devilish humour. For example check out the inscription on Margos T-shirt below the image of a squirrel hoarding its stash ""Protect Your Nuts.""

Photo Merrick Morton From left Ben Affleck Patrick Fugit David Clennon Lisa Barnes and Kim Dickens in ""Gone Girl."" 20th Century Fox photo At least once in a lifetime a married man will awaken with the thought ""This is not my beautiful wife."" Most of those drowsy husbands go back to slumberland. The question that hangs over ""Gone Girl"" like a cloud of carbon monoxide is whether dreamboat husband Nick Dunne sent wife Amy to the big sleep.Nick (Ben Affleck) and Amy (Rosamund Pike) share a beautiful house in fictional North Carthage Mo. (The movie was filmed in Cape Girardeau.) But they dont share much else. Like the McMansion they can no longer afford their marriage is frayed around the edges. Amy is from New York where she met aspiring writer Nick. Five years into their marriage she finds herself stuck in the semi-rural river town where underachieving Nick runs a bar with his twin sister Margo (Carrie Coon).On the morning of their fifth anniversary Amy disappears leaving behind an apparently violent crime scene and the first of a series of enveloped clues. Adapted by Gillian Flynn from her best-selling novel and directed by David Fincher (""Se7en"") ""Gone Girl"" is not the usual murder mystery where everyone in the cast is a suspect. The books many readers know -- and early scenes in the film confirm -- that Nick is determined to learn what happened to his wife. So notwithstanding Afflecks poker-faced charm we know that the joker up his sleeve is not a murder weapon and were willing to ride shotgun while he solves the puzzle.Close behind is a surly bloodhound cop (Kim Dickens) and the national media. Years ago Amy was the inspiration for a series of childrens books that helped pay the mortgage and her disappearance is big news.For much of its overlong running time ""Gone Girl"" is less about solving a crime than skewering modern marriage and the short-attention span of TV viewers. Yet as with the undernourished subtext about the recession that turned the local mall into a marketplace for drugs and guns Fincher backs away from the guilty pleasures in the premise. Although theres a Nancy Grace lookalike (Missy Pyle) who scrutinizes Nicks every move the meticulous director is slow to grab us by the throat. In the second-half flashback Finchers forensic precision pays off when he finally goes for the jugular (literally) yet a skeptic from the Show-Me State might poke holes in the perfect-crime conclusion. (Helpful hint The cops should take a close look at the surveillance-camera tapes.)And that same skeptic could question some of the casting choices. Neil Patrick Harris as a snooty suitor from Ladue tries so hard not to be Neil Patrick Harris that he barely has an angry inch of presence. And who got the bright idea that the exotic beauty from Robin Thickes ""Blurred Lines"" video (Emily Ratajkowski) could pass for a corn-fed college student? (We cant believe were saying this but thank god for Tyler Perry as Nicks cynical lawyer.) Ultimately what makes ""Gone Girl"" so watchable is the three-headed monster of Fincher Pike and Affleck. The director bathes the B-movie scenario in the queasy-green hues of a morgue while Affleck flashes his million-dollar smile like a dime-store Dracula and the beautifully inscrutable Pike absorbs the light like a wax mannequin. If its true that Nick and Amy were made for each other they were made in a fiendish lab.What ""Gone Girl""  Three stars out of four  Rating R  Run time 229  Content A scene of bloody violence some strong sexual content/nudity and language Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

On the occasion of his fifth wedding anniversary Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) reports that his beautiful wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) has gone missing. The new trailer of ""Gone Girl"" has Neil Patrick Harris making an appearance. Based on the novel of the same name by Gillian Flynn ""Gone Girl"" is set for an October 3rd release date. (20th Century Fox) By Ann Hornaday October 2 2014 Follow AnnHornaday The challenge for any director bringing Gillian Flynns addictive 2012 whodunit ""Gone Girl"" to the big screen is to capture the propulsive page-turning readability that made the book such a diabolically pleasurable airplane read. David Fincher has risen to the challenge by making a straight-edged handsomely realized airplane movie which is not nearly the same thing. At a tushie-numbing 2 1 / 2 hours Finchers ""Gone Girl"" might provide some welcome diversion on a trip over the flyover country the book and movie subtly lampoon The twisty plot sophisticated production values and handful of standout performances will no doubt persuade rows of fidgety viewers that theyre watching something of intelligence quality and impeccable literary provenance. But its just that sense of seriousness that keeps ""Gone Girl"" from reaching its fullest potential. Unaccountably Flynn -- who adapted her own book for the screen -- has left some of her tangiest provocations either entirely unplumbed or superficially pinged. ""Gone Girl"" is a ""yes but"" movie Yes its well-made but it stays maddeningly on its own polished surfaces. Its smart but not clever or probing or risky enough to be truly brilliant. Its absorbing but not terribly deep memorable or finally all that much fun to watch. These are just the kind of nagging picayune nitpicks that can make someone sound suspiciously like Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) the impossibly demanding -- and rich and smart and gorgeous -- enigma at the center of ""Gone Girl"" which revolves around her disappearance in North Carthage Mo. Thats where Amy has moved with her husband Nick (Ben Affleck) who asked her to return with him to his home town to attend to his dying mother and ride out a bumpy economy. As ""Gone Girl"" opens Nick is coming to work at his new job proprietor of a local tavern called the Bar which he runs with his twin sister Margo (Carrie Coon). ""I know the Bar"" exclaims Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) one of the detectives assigned to Nick and Amys case. ""Great name -- very meta."" The same could be said for ""Gone Girl"" in which Nick appears first as a panicked husband and then as a suspect partly due to his own tendency to smile and flirt at inappropriate moments -- an ingratiating habit hes developed to keep from appearing like an arrogant jerk (a character trait played out with more rich detail in the book). Playing Nick with thick bleary-eyed handsomeness Affleck is quietly persuasive as a guy who in another era might have been a master of the universe but is still reeling from having that perch snatched from under him. For her part Amy radiantly played by Pike in the kind of leading role she has long deserved emerges in flashbacks and reenacted diary entries first as a too-good-to-be-true Manhattan singleton then as a young wife whose patience with her husbands personal and professional setbacks may not be entirely long-suffering. Both Affleck and Pike are convincing as the compulsively self-conscious highly unreliable dual narrators of ""Gone Girl."" The film also features some terrific supporting performances most notably from Dickens Coon and Tyler Perry as a celebrity criminal defense attorney who winds up being an alternately amused and exasperated Greek chorus observing the storys most vertiginous zigs and zags. That those turns finally send ""Gone Girl"" into such outlandish territory is very much in keeping with the books florid third act here featuring a wildly miscast Neil Patrick Harris in a pivotal role. But the storys pulpy nuttiness isnt particularly well served by Finchers careful literal-minded restraint in which what might have been a teasingly perverse romp on a par with ""To Die For"" becomes something more glum and fatally defanged. On a meta level that Detective Boney would no doubt appreciate ""Gone Girl"" contains within it a fascinating meditation on TV scandal culture gender politics and the private and performative selves that comprise every marriage. But rather than reel in the audience by adopting the books own seductively confiding tone Fincher keeps the material at arms length depicting Nick and Amys courtship and marriage with the unlived-in emotional distance of their bland Pottery Barn-perfect house. The result is a movie thats nominally all about subverting expectations but that never gives us convincing expectations to subvert. Finchers somber exacting tone leeches the diabolical humor that would have given ""Gone Girl"" much-needed satirical juice. With few exceptions (often by way of Coons tartly revelatory portrayal of the acid-tongued Margo) the film plays even the storys most darkly funny passages tensely straight ending up less a parodic pageant of fame whoredom image manipulation and pseudo-feminist have-it-all rhetoric than a conventionally pessimistic -- and by the way very talky -- thriller. Whether all that talk winds up buying into or playing off of trite images of controlling women and callow men may depend on each viewers individual lens. Whats less debatable is how little fun Fincher seems to be having with the tussle. Put another way in the context of the filmmakers oeuvre ""Gone Girl"" could have used less ""Social Network"" sober-mindedness and more ""Fight Club"" brio -- or even the moxie of ""House of Cards"" the Fincher-produced Netflix series whose length breadth and cynical streak might have more suitably served Flynns slippery characters and their unsettling sleights of hand (and heart). ""Gone Girl"" may get the job done as a dutiful deliberately paced procedural but it never quite makes the splash it could have as a thoughtful timely and thoroughly bracing plunge.   R.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Gone Girl--David Finchers cold cruel and often very funny adaptation of Gillian Flynns bestselling novel--plays so many tricks at the viewers expense that it becomes difficult to take anything it does at face value. Ending exactly where it started with a repeat of its enigmatic opening scene the movie traffics in flashbacks and backward twists that purport to reveal more and more about its dissatisfied central couple but which only uncover facades. Fincher fixates on causality; one thing is always leading to another--a clue to a clue a detail to an inference a fake-out to a reveal a kiss to an oral swab. It all seems intoxicatingly logical pasted with date stamps connected by associative cuts and wrapped up in Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross silky Mark Isham-esque score. One might be inclined to label the movie as a series of elaborate misdirections if it werent implicitly conditioning the viewer to mistrust its characters. Like the Paul Verhoeven movies it occasionally resembles Gone Girl is a satire that doubles as tightly styled perverse entertainment--a deconstructed thriller with a bop-bop-bop drum-machine pace which builds to one of the sourest most hopeless downer endings in recent memory. Finchers style--with its looming ceilings and motel-murder-scene lighting--can make something as simple as a man going out for a cup of coffee look like a procedural. Working off a script (by Flynn herself) that correlates suburban home life with a convoluted mystery he has made a movie in which the lurid and the mundane look exactly alike and where the underworld is represented by an abandoned shopping mall where suburbanites go to buy drugs. One Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) disappears from her suburban Missouri home on the morning of her fifth wedding anniversary. Her hapless husband Nick (Ben Affleck) finds himself at the center of a media circus his every move interpreted as a sign of guilt. While he hides out at the bungalow of his twin sister and business partner Go (Carrie Coon) no-nonsense local detective Boney (Kim Dickens) rifles through his drawers and personal finances uncovering a paper trail of bills letters and anniversary notes that suggest that hes hiding something. Eventually Nick is forced to seek out the services of Tanner Bolt (a superb Tyler Perry) a charismatic lawyer who specializes in defending ""wife-killers."" And still theres no body or definitive proof that Nick had something to do with his wifes disappearance. Gone Girl starts with easy targets--pop psychologists sensationalized newscasts overbearing parents dumb neighbors--and works its way inward; once a viewer accepts that Nick and Amy arent the people everyone else makes them out to be they may begin to suspect that they arent the people they make themselves out to be either. Narrated scenes from Amys diary--many of them set in an artificial mannered nighttime New York that seems modeled on Eyes Wide Shut--run parallel to the investigation into her disappearance. Her voice is a low Lauren Bacall purr and it immediately registers as an affectation; pretty soon Nicks exasperated cluelessness starts to seem like a put-on too. The more thoroughly the movie proves his innocence the harder it becomes for the viewer to trust him.This is where things get really tricky because Gone Girl gives its audience plenty of reasons to think of Nick and Amy as archetypes representative of all married couples and most of those reasons come straight from the characters mouths. ""Thats marriage"" declares Amy at the end of an especially brutal scene--a sharply delivered line that could be interpreted as a thesis statement for the movie were viewers to believe that Amy is being sincere. But they cant which is more or less the point. Gone Girl isnt a movie about marriage or relationships or men and women but about the way people assume established familiar archetypes to please manipulate and entrap one another. The Dunnes behavior is predictable but only because they are playing roles--for their parents for the media for the people they assume each other to be. The movies most tantalizing mystery is the question of whats really going on in their heads. It remains unanswered.For thoughts on and a place to discuss the plot details not talked about in this review visit Gone Girls spoiler space.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 719 p.m. EDT October 2 2014Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike star in Gone Girl.(Photo Merrick Morton 20th Century Fox) 217 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMOREGone Girl is to marriage what Fatal Attraction was to infidelity.The topnotch film adaptation of Gillian Flynns best-selling suspense novel posits that what is nearest and ostensibly dearest may kill you ( out of four rated R; opening Thursday in select theaters and Friday nationwide).Home is not only where the heart is. Its where potential danger lurks behind every ottoman cabinet door and kitchen appliance.Where 1987s Fatal Attraction focused on the potential evil that can come with straying Gone Girl focuses on the devil you know -- or think you know.Fans of Flynns riveting page-turner will find the mesmerizing movie version by director David Fincher supremely smart and undeniably sinister. Its at once faithful to the source and even more precisely constructed. A few ancillary characters and non-essential scenarios were jettisoned to focus on the taut psychological thriller and murder mystery that centers on Amy Elliot Dunne (Rosamund Pike) and Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) on the day of their fifth wedding anniversary. Its a superb match of material actors and filmmaker.USA TODAYBen Affleck talks marriage Gone role relating to fameWith her serenely cool beauty Pike is ideally cast in the role of the privileged manipulative and calculating Amy. An under-utilized and terrific actress the British Pike plays sophisticated New Yorker Amy impeccably. Amys childhood was plagiarized her husband Nick observes by opportunistic parents who wrote a series of popular childrens books about ""Amazing Amy."" Amys extraordinary upbringing is alluded to rather than fully revealed as in the novel but what the audience learns is enough.Afflecks Nick hits all the right notes self-serving deceitful and irresistibly affable. The suspenseful structure follows that of the novel with events seen through the perspectives of both Nick and Amy sometimes via Amys explicit diary entries other times through first-person accounts. The action kicks off on the morning of Amys mysterious disappearance from the suburban Missouri home she shares with Nick.The nation -- and especially tabloid TV -- is transfixed. Everyone has an opinion on whodunit.Key players include inquisitive local detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) Amys publicity-seeking parents Rand and Marybeth Elliot (David Clennon and Lisa Banes) Nicks supportive sister Margo (Carrie Coon) and a seemingly ever-present phalanx of scandal-hungry reporters.For nearly 21/2 hours -- a running time that glides by surprisingly briskly -- either or both of the dysfunctional marital partners come off as alternately diabolical and sympathetic convincing and unreliable appealing and appalling. With its twists turns and wildly swerving switchbacks the insidious story keeps the viewer fully absorbed and on ever-shifting ground.Supporting players are superbly cast often just as the reader pictured them particularly Margo and detective Boney. Tyler Perry is excellent as lawyer Tanner Bolt and Neil Patrick Harris is sublime as Desi Collings an old flame of Amys.Did Nick kill his wife? Who do we believe? As the clues mount and often lead viewers astray the saga grows all the more compelling. A pervasively menacing atmosphere -- intensified by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross eerily evocative score -- keeps the audience mesmerized.If Alfred Hitchcock were alive today hed surely have wanted to film Gone Girl. But the brilliant Fincher may just be his successor having done the job magnificently. He has taken a gripping read and made it into an equally captivating movie no small feat. Fincher has experience with the adaptation process having helmed the American version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. He also knows how to make an exceedingly unsettling psychological thriller -- 1995s Seven -- and a thoroughly absorbing police procedural with 2007s Zodiac.Flynns screenplay has just the right amount of intricate detail from her novel with minor additions that even improve upon the source material. She has a keen sense of what works on the page but might not emerge cinematically.Grimly dark humor and spot-on production design buttress the captivating story and heighten the unnerving atmosphere. Gone Girl will leave you breathless and haunted.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike bring the best-selling book Gone Girl to the big screen.

Preposterous illogical senselessly over-plotted and artificial as a ceramic artichoke David Finchers Gone Girl is another splatterfest disguised as a psychological thriller about the disintegration of a murderous marriage that I find one of the years grossest disappointments. At one point I turned to the woman next to me--a distinguished lady film critic--and asked ""Does any of this make sense to you?"" ""Not a word of it"" she replied. So why is it being drooled over by gushing websites as a ""sensational hit""? The applause at the end of the screening I attended was tepid and the reviews Ive read are grudgingly mixed. Another example I guess of todays hysterical overhyped media reaction to everything confusing overwrought and drowning in pretentious overkill. Gone Girl lives up to all of the above--and then some. Its an ill-advised and poorly executed mess that shows a master craftsman at half-mast casting around for a little controversy. GONE GIRL  (2/4 stars) Written by Gillian Flynn Directed by David Fincher Starring Ben Affleck Rosamund Pike and Neil Patrick Harris Running time 149 min. I didnt read the book by Gillian Flynn but could it positively have been as phony and contrived as the movie she has been unwisely asked to adapt from it? The dialogue is so laughable it borders on Saturday Night Live parody. Yes it has the kind of requisite plot twists many so-called critics regard as necessary tools to make thrillers work but not one of them rises above the status of gimmickry or stem from any realistic motivation. Worst of all despite good acting from an elegant cast director Mr. Finchers artfully staged violence and its endlessly changing tempos in narrative form the movie is a stultifying bore. What might have worked on paper just lulls moviegoers weaned on cinematic slaughter into lethargy. Praised for its literary structure the movie has entirely too much of it. I cant remember the last time I had so many restless minutes in the dark checking my watch. The pretentious palaver begins with the New York society wedding of Nick Dunne (a name that starts the whole thing off on a laughable note for starters; could it be that the author never heard of Dominick Dunne always called ""Nick""?) and Amy Elliott the daughter of a snobby mother who has made a living stage-managing her daughters life into a successful series of Amazing Amy childrens books which in essence plagiarize her own childhood. Nick (Ben Affleck) and Amy (sublime Rosamund Pike who has been enriching other peoples movies so long that its a treat to see her showcased as the star of her own) are both New York magazine writers who meet cute and marry even cuter in 2005 lose their jobs and their money and move to a small fictional town in Missouri to place his ailing father in an assisted-living facility. Five years later on the verge of their fifth anniversary Amy vanishes into thin air. The first act of a movie that would make a much better play is about how miserable Amy is. Flashbacks contrast her glamorous previous life in Manhattan with her dreary working-class surroundings in the Midwestern suburbs but otherwise do nothing to enlighten the mystery of what happened to Amy. Was she murdered? Everyone thinks so. Act Two shifts gears and shows the same five years from Nicks point of view while he searches for his missing wife with the help of his potty-mouthed sister (Carrie Coon a most unfortunate moniker for any actress who wants to be a household name) a rough lady detective (Kim Dickens) and a crafty defense lawyer (Tyler Perry). They get clues from Amys diary and from Nicks off-screen narration to no avail. While they click off the days they come up with the conclusion that Amy was a clever manipulative schemer who may have orchestrated her own disappearance and death for no other reason than to pin the crime on Nick. Again the question why? The motive isnt money; Nick doesnt have any. So ""Why?"" becomes a simple question you find yourself asking for 150 minutes. Act Three takes another left turn at the cross roads when Amy miraculously rejoins the living and starts the countdown to not one but several finales. The more the days waft by the crazier she becomes. An innocent naive ex-boyfriend shows up to help her and she slits his throat with a box cutter. I offer this revelation not as a spoiler (there are more shocks to come) but to illustrate how none of this excessive plotting makes one lick of sense. It is never clear why Amy would frame Nick for her abduction and no reason why she would later lure a man to rape her violently. Walking into the cameras of the media dripping with blood she just seems like one of the hapless wives of Dracula. Amy is obviously a raving psychopath although there is nothing in her background to indicate insanity. Nick is not the dutiful husband he pretends to be. Hes one burner short of a stovetop too. Theres nobody to root for or care about. And the movie is so choppy it looks like it was edited with pinking shears. Meandering through the gimmicks in a daze Mr. Affleck is like a glossy 8 x 10 suitable for framing but anxiously in need of Photoshopping. As a toxic villain without much conviction Ms. Pike manages to be both ravishing and riveting. Neil Patrick Harris playing against type is a toxic all-American red herring. Other characters enter the picture--Lola Kirke and Scoot McNairy as a trailer trash couple from the Ozarks who rob Amy a predatory TV interviewer played perfectly by the delectable Sela Ward--but they never pay off by making any kind of coherent contribution to the plot. Theyre nothing more than padding. It all seems manufactured empty of the most basic human feelings. Even as a poisonous attack on marriage it exudes mannered existentialism instead of a ""gotcha"" sense of ""reality bites."" I hated his Girl with the Dragon Tattoo but I usually like the negativity in the dark clammy subterranean ozone where Mr. Fincher bases his creepiest films (Se7en Fight Club and the uniquely original Curious Case of Benjamin Button). The pointless Gone Girl is nothing more than an annoying case of showing off.

VPC Bill Goodykoontz USA TODAY NETWORK 1043 a.m. MST October 1 2014David Finchers film version of the popular novel lives up to the hype with outstanding acting and strong directing making it a compellingly entertaining movie. Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) finds himself the chief suspect behind the shocking disappearance of his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) on their fifth anniversary in the film ""Gone Girl."" (Photo 20th Century Fox )Story HighlightsCritics review 4.5 starsFinchers uncanny knack for making the ugly compelling remains intact.Affleck is perfect as Nick charming but arrogant while Pike has never been better.Finchers strong direction goes a long way toward making the film so entertaining.""Gone Girl"" arrives in theaters heavy with expectations from fans of the book wondering how the film version can possibly compare to those who havent read it wondering what the fuss is about.Long story short The movie absolutely lives up to the hype.David Finchers meticulous direction pays off in spades. From the way he expresses the books construction -- not quite he-said/she-said but a version of that -- to the way the film looks (cold and uncaring like its characters) to his work with actors (go Tyler Perry) ""Gone Girl"" delivers.Lets clear up a couple of things before proceeding. First I am one of the six or seven people left who have not read Gillian Flynns novel although I have read so much about it in the past few weeks that I am familiar with it including yes how it ends.Second those who have read the book know that it is filled with twists some of the jaw-dropping variety. So is the film so well be treading lightly in terms of plot here.At its heart the film is the story of a marriage. Nick (Ben Affleck) and Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) have in fact been married five years as the film begins to the day.RELATED 5 of the best films starring Ben AffleckBut its not exactly a celebration. Nick heads down to the bar (called the Bar) that he owns with his twin sister Margo (Carrie Coon) and has a pre-noon shot of liquor. Their discussion makes it clear that this is not at present a happy marriage. He heads home and finds an open door a broken glass table and no Amy. He calls the police and detectives Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) and Jim Gilpin (Patrick Fugit) take over the scene. Theyre friendly concerned maybe a little suspicious.Maybe a lot eventually certainly when Amy doesnt show up. Suspicion grows particularly among the townspeople and then the national media one of Finchers broadest targets here. Missi Pyle in particular is spot-on as the loathsome Nancy Grace-type talking head Ellen Abbott.Nick does himself no favors. He doesnt seem concerned enough for the Abbott types who scream for his arrest. But Amys body hasnt shown up so Boney continues to build her case.Meanwhile we learn more about Nick and Amy through Amys diary which Pike reads in a voice-over. They met-cute in New York where he worked for a mens magazine and she wrote quizzes for a womens magazine. Amy is we find out Amazing Amy a character in a popular series of childrens books written by her therapist parents (David Clennon and Lisa Barnes). Their literary Amy is a kind of wish-fulfillment version of their real daughter (real Amy gets cut from volleyball fictional Amy makes varsity) either unaware or uncaring what that might do to their daughters psyche.RELATED Worried about Gone Girl? Simmer downAmy and Nick have a fantasy romance get married and the bottom drops out first from the economy then from their lives.

(Photo 20th Century Fox)Yet it is insanely entertaining. Affleck is the perfect Nick boyish good looks colored by a thin veneer of arrogance -- you can like him but not love him. Pike has never been better but then few roles would offer the challenge that Amy does. Neil Patrick Harris is ridiculously fun as a former boyfriend of Amys. Fincher presents them all without judgment really -- other than to show that theyre all flawed. Flynn who wrote the script doesnt really give us any heroes and though there are villains no one comes out unscathed.Who wants to watch that? You do. Fincher is a master at making the unappealing compelling. In his best work like ""Fight Club"" ""Zodiac"" and ""The Social Network"" we see things we dont want to see maybe but we dont dare look away. His careful visual style his composition -- its masterful. You really know youve been to a movie.""Gone Girl"" doesnt quite live up to his best films but its close. And as for that ending about whether he stays true to the book?

Pathology still interests him though and so we get toxic parents toxic lovers toxic siblings toxic friendships and a toxic cultural swamp in which they can all go about the nasty business of living. The story tells of a below-average guy (Ben Affleck hulking and yet expressive) whose wife (Rosamund Pike lean and impassive) goes missing ""under suspicious circumstances"" intertwined first with the tale of their gradually curdling romance and then with an account of ""what really happened."" Finchers chief delight seems to be in playing with genre conventions what looks like an especially moody whodunit morphs first into a psychosexual thriller and then into what might just be straight-faced (and utterly black-hearted) satire.

"Gone Girl review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review Gone Girl  1/2 David Fincher and Gillian Flynn a perfect match for Gone Girl Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips reviews director David Finchers latest ""Gone Girl"" starring Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike. Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips reviews director David Finchers latest ""Gone Girl"" starring Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike. Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune David Fincher and Gillian Flynn prove a match made in marital hell. David Finchers film version of the Gillian Flynn bestseller ""Gone Girl"" is a stealthy snake-like achievement. Its everything the book was and more -- more certainly in its sinister brackish atmosphere dominated by mustard-yellow fluorescence designed to make you squint recoil and then lean in a little closer.So often in Finchers movies and especially in this one actors are placed precisely against a window or in shadows surrounded by low-wattage electric light sources. Its all deliberate. Fincher and cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth shooting digitally address moral rot through direct means so that the guilty consciences and hidden agendas of the characters are made manifest. This is a prime date movie for couples harboring at least one good-sized secret or several years of serious resentments. Flynn makes a couple of missteps I think in adapting her hit novel for the screen at least one of which will fuel the argument that the authors conception of the story is misogynist. But so much works well here from the spectacularly right casting to the eerie musical score. The story implications are what they are but were talking about high-grade pulp fiction here crafty and unsettling. A brilliantly edited opening-credits sequence flashes quick nervous images of the recession-hobbled Missouri town where the story unfolds. The films primary narrator is Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck never more subtle or effective) a laid-off Manhattan magazine writer. (Flynn herself was let go from Entertainment Weekly where she wrote about television.) To look after his aging parents Nick has returned to North Carthage Mo. with his wife also a writer. She is Amy (Rosamund Pike) who in her closely watched childhood served as the inspiration for her parents ""Amazing Amy"" series of storybooks.Nearly two years into their North Carthage life together knocking around a pristine McMansion without communicating whats actually on their minds Nick and Amy are in trouble. Nicks mother is dead; his father struggling with Alzheimers is in assisted living; and the marriage has hit rough road with not much money left. Amy expected more. In Nick back in New York City Amy found her quick-witted temperamentally easygoing Midwestern dream hunk. He saw a golden girl out of his league up for anything. Thats all in the flashbacks; the present-day action of ""Gone Girl"" begins when Amy disappears one day from the home leased with her trust-fund money. The narrative options are pretty simple considering how many complications Flynn concocts. Either Amy was abducted or Nick somehow faked the disappearance and killed her or...well lets stick to the evidence. We first hear from Amy by way of voice-over as Pike reads diary entries from happier days. Soon the entries grow more foreboding. Long before shes aware of the diarys existence the local police detective assigned to the missing-person case Rhonda Boney speculates on Nicks guilt and that look in his eyes that says Somethings wrong. Boney is played by Kim Dickens and whatever sort of Mark Twain-country Sherlock you imagined reading Flynns book Dickens is right on the money a savvy voice of intelligence and reason. Shes also a strong counter-argument to the line that ""Gone Girl"" has one particular vision or version of female behavior to offer. Carrie Coon is terrific as Nicks twin Margo the sounding board and Greek chorine who gets most of the choice wisecracks as she navigates the aftermath of Amys disappearance. New Gone Girl trailer A new ""Gone Girl"" trailer is released. A new ""Gone Girl"" trailer is released. See more videos The way Flynn wrote Nick every big actor in the industry could relate to ""Gone Girls"" tortures-of-the-media-damned angle. Eventually Nick learns how to change public perception under the wing of his hotshot legal defender. Tyler Perry plays the lawyer Tanner Bolt and like Affleck hes never been more relaxed and truthful on screen -- which sounds weird in a crime story built upon lie after lie.Its safe to say that Amy portrayed as an immaculate series of enigmas by Pike belongs to subspecies of chameleon and in interviews Flynn has spoken about what ""Gone Girl"" says about the false fronts afflicting so many modern marriages. Heres a structural flaw of the movie In the book Flynn kept the twin-track points of view nice and even so that Amy gave us her version of the marriage and related matters to the same degree we heard from Nick. The movie tips things in favor of Nick. It also leaks information about the storys first major revelation earlier than Flynn did in the novel. As in the novel the movie threatens to buckle around the three-quarter mark when a key character transforms into a straw psycho more on the Michael Crichton pulp level than the Gillian Flynn pulp level. Trent Reznor Atticus Ross to score David Finchers Gone Girl Oliver Gettell Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor and English musician Atticus Ross will put their knack for chilly moody soundscapes to use once again in director David Finchers upcoming thriller ""Gone Girl"" an adaptation of the Gillian Flynn novel about a man whose wife disappears on their fifth anniversary... Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor and English musician Atticus Ross will put their knack for chilly moody soundscapes to use once again in director David Finchers upcoming thriller ""Gone Girl"" an adaptation of the Gillian Flynn novel about a man whose wife disappears on their fifth anniversary... (Oliver Gettell) Its up to Fincher to take us home and to justify the two-and-a-half-hour running time. That he does. His control-freakish mastery draws out something strange or discordant in each new scene. And the big moments carry genuine impact. Take for example the way the director stages and edits (with editor Kirk Baxter) the films bloodiest act of violence. Its shocking and like all the sex-related material in the movie about as sexy as a trip to the morgue. But the scene itself scored with remarkable throbbing underscoring by composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is enough to make you forget the storys phonier constructs and less plausible supporting characters such as Amys boarding-school sweetheart played (a tad archly) by Neil Patrick Harris. Like the novel the film will frustrate a certain percentage of customers whod prefer the story to go a different direction. As proven by ""Zodiac"" Finchers commercially disappointing masterpiece this is a director who believes in the power and the value of frustration. In light of his craftsmanly but wholly unnecessary English-language remake of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" one could say this director ""should"" be doing some other kinds of stuff more ambitious or unexpected. On the other hand the film world needs its first-rate dreadmongers. Im not sure Fincher has tremendous range; in the second half of ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" the whimsy of the story became a weird mismatch with Finchers innate gleaming cynicism. ""Gone Girl"" presents no such mismatch. I am getting a bit sick of Finchers patented mustard-yellow palette but the fact that its on my mind indicates how many different ways this director controls our responses. There is no moral to ""Gone Girl"" though the more paranoid and reactionary among us may take it as a validation of their attitudes toward women. I think Flynns working on a higher level than that though. This is a black comedy about true love as some people define it and Fincher turned out to be the right cinematic conduit. mjphillipstribune.comMPAA rating R (for a scene of bloody violence some strong sexual content/nudity and language) Running time 229Opens Thursday evening Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Movies David Fincher Literature Gone Girl Rosamund Pike Reviews Ben Affleck Gone GIrl Gone Girl author Gillian Flynn makes confident leap into screenwriting Fall movie season Time for the good stuff Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising70deg",http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-gone-girl-20140930-column.html#navtype=outfit,200,gonegirl29,gonegirl,chicagotribune
"Review Gone Girl leaps successfully from page to screen - Mercury News Hot Topics San Diego cop killed Big Sur fire Michael Parros Lake Tahoe warming Keith Urban Alphabet hiring Star Parties Facebook tax bill Brock Turner case Ask Amy SV150 Print Email Font ResizeReview Gone Girl leaps successfully from page to screenBy Randy MyersMercury News correspondentPosted 09/30/2014 030056 PM PDTUpdated 10/01/2014 051024 PM PDT Theirs is a perfect union a director heralded for his expert ability to gaze into the dark soul of human nature paired with the sensational literary thriller about what disturbing turns a relationship can take. Naturally were talking about ""Gone Girl"" David Finchers mesmerizing adaptation of the page-turning novel by Gillian Flynn. Anchored by blistering performances from Rosamund Pike as a beautiful wife who goes missing and Ben Affleck as her prime-suspect husband ""Gone Girl"" is as mesmerizing to watch as the book was to read. And thats no small praise. Since its debut in 2012 this best-seller with its red herrings and plot twists has been a talker one that gripped readers from its opening pages and kept the surprises coming. But to make a movie of it? Could its tone and the voices of its two provocative narrators be transferred intact to the big screen? And if you already know how it turns out is the thrill all but gone? Yes it works and yes it still keeps you at the edge of your seat despite its length (2 1/2 hours) and thats in large credit to the screenplay which also was written by Flynn. While theres no denying that ""Gone Girls"" hairpin turns are more of a slap in the face the first time around this grim and disturbing psychological story is still gripping even if you know where its headed.Advertisement At face value the story seems about as original as a TV crime procedural. On their fifth anniversary the handsome and unhappily married Nick Dunne (Affleck) comes home to discover his wife Amy is gone. There are a few clues but when a detective (Kim Dickens in a career-making performance) spots a smear of blood a suspect is born.As the story unfolds two questions remain Why does Nick seems so unconcerned? And where is Amy? From that setup we travel back and forth in time. We meet Nick and Amy who as a beloved child served as the inspiration for her parents best-selling ""Amazing Amy"" childrens book series. We watch Nick and Amy fall passionately in love unable to keep their hands off each other. Eventually job losses a sick mother and a move from New York City to a small town in Missouri take their toll on the relationship.Back to the present Amys disappearance sets off vigils national concern and judgments handed down about Nick on TV and in magazines. A Facebook photo leads to finger-pointing and gossip.Nick does little to help his cause appearing detached at news conferences unable to conceal his usual smug smile. When his twin sister Margo nicknamed ""Go"" (Carrie Coon) discovers secrets about her brother shes shocked and drawn into this game of deceit.Trying to puzzle out why Nick acts the way he does and what makes Amy tick is half the lurid fun of ""Gone Girl."" But so are the ample background stories Flynn teases out. One of those involves a mysterious character played by Neil Patrick Harris. Its a small role but Harris nails it. I cant say much more or youll hate me. As Amy Pike is a revelation. The actress who until now played mostly secondary roles in films from ""An Education"" to ""Pride and Prejudice"" demonstrates versatility with compelling eyes that can instantly switch from innocent to detached. Oscar consideration is certainly a possibility for her.Same thing for Fincher best known for ""The Social Network"" ""Seven"" and ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo."" Once again he draws out strong performances from his cast and never loses control of complicated material even in the last half of the film -- which demands a lot of its director. But everyones stellar from the supporting players (who would have imagined Tyler Perry would be so relaxed and disarming as a high-powered attorney?) to Jeff Cronenworth a frequent Fincher collaborator who gets credit for the evocative cinematography to Donald Graham Burts production design. As for the story both the book and now the film can be enjoyed simply as a thriller -- or something a bit more. Despite its smattering of dark humor ""Gone Girl"" makes no compromises as it takes us to a disturbing ultimate destination exposing our lurid demand for the sensational for tidily packaged beginnings and endings. And you cant help but wonder if we too play a part in the kinds of crimes that occur deep in the bloody heart of ""Gone Girl.""gone girl     Rating R (for a scene of bloody violence some strong sexual content/nudity and language) Cast Ben Affleck Rosamund Pike Neil Patrick Harris Tyler Perry Kim Dickens Patrick Fugit Carrie Coon David Clennon Director David FincherRunning time 2 hours 25 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Talend Silicon Valleys latest tech IPO has a strong debutSource Tesla looking at cameras radar in Florida crashCartoons Hillary Clinton makes history Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

Or do you want to read every piece of analysis about the unexpected twists of a movie like Gone Girl after youve seen it? Were debuting a new feature on Time.com developed by TIMEs tech lead Mark Parolisi that lets you have it both ways. Click here to reveal the full analysis if youve already seen the film (the spoilers will be in bold) and click again if you change your mind (the spoilers will appear blurred). Their courtship was a dream the meeting of attractive opposites -- two journalists for New York magazines -- reviving the fond banter of film stars past. On their first date Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) a small-town Midwesterner at ease in the big city took rich elegant Manhattanite Amy Elliott (Rosamund Pike) on a pre-dawn stroll to a bakery and kissed her as powdered sugar fluttered around them like the finest snowflakes. Later at a press party for the Amazing Amy childrens books her parents had written about her Nick pretended to interview her and from his notebook removed an engagement ring. A man -- a woman too but for now the man -- puts a lot of effort into the courtship role. He plays he may even briefly be the charming considerate fellow attentive to his womans every need or whim just like the hero of some classic romantic comedy that ends at the altar. But thats just the Old Hollywood version; in real life the wedding is the beginning of a different story. And if courtship is a movie marriage is a job that can become a grinding routine an Ever After without the Happily. In the morning-after cinders of the honeymoon glow a man may ignore his bride and find a younger woman with whom he can play another exciting game adultery. Did you ever wonder even for an instant if you could kill your spouse? Or be killed by the one you wed? And if not could others imagine it of you? Those are some of the taunts running through Gone Girl the Gillian Flynn novel and the taut faithful movie that she as screenwriter and David Fincher have made from it. In a property with all the killer-thriller tricks -- sudden disappearance and violent death dark motives and cunning misdirection -- the true creepiness of Gone Girl is in its portrait of a marriage gone sour curdled from its emotional and erotic liberation of courtship into a life sentence together till death do they part. In Gone Girl marriage is a prison and each spouse is both jailer and inmate -- perhaps even executioner too. Soon after the wedding Nick and Amy lost their jobs. When he learned from his twin sister Margo (Carrie Coon) that their mother was dying of cancer Nick abruptly decided to move back to North Carthage Mo. and take Amy with him. They sold their brownstone -- Amys brownstone -- at a loss. Nick and Margo bought a bar with Amys money and he taught a journalism class at the community college. (In the book the course is called ""How to Launch a Career in Magazines"" -- a little joke from Flynn who became a full-time novelist when she was cashiered after a decade at Entertainment Weekly.) When not tending bar with Margo Nick has kindled an affair with sexy student Andie (Emily Ratajkowski) which leaves Amy alone at home with no job doing... hey what is this brilliant industrious woman doing? Nick has no idea. One thing that consumed her interest was preparing a treasure hunt for their fifth wedding anniversary as she has done each year before offering clues in rhyme to the hiding places of various gifts. But around noon on the big day Nick discovers that Amy is gone from their home. Signs of a struggle and blood wiped from the kitchen floor suggest she was abducted possibly murdered. She and Nick were heard arguing the night before and when word of his affair gets around he becomes the prime suspect -- if not to Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) the tough but sympathetic senior detective on the case then to the neighbors and the avid rabid media. Amy has left a diary the record of a devoted wifes growing suspicions and gnawing fear of her swine of a spouse as well as the first clue in a brand-new treasure hunt. Nick now must juggle three uncomfortable roles villain victim and sleuth. On the page Gone Girl was a literary game a tennis match of alternating chapters from Nick and Amy with the reader offering to take each characters side every few pages. Flynn simply -- or rather complexly -- interwove the narratives Nicks in the present revealing more of his sins as he tracks the treasure-hunt clues and Amys in the past through her diary. He-said-she-said is fine for books but movies play with the cinematic precept that seeing is believing we show you swallow. Given the dueling narratives of which one both or neither may be exactly true its pretty impressive that Flynn and Fincher have managed to transfer this bookish jest successfully to the screen. The film amasses evidence against Nick through his own misdeeds which we see and through the testimony of Amys diary -- a silk scarf that may become a noose -- which we are shown. Like the novel the movie detonates its big twist halfway through. So film reviewers must juggle the same ethical dilemma that faced book critics whether or not to reveal the storys shocking middle. So here Amy exasperated with her lazy careless husband and the glum life he had forced her into faked her own murder and fashioned clues in the diary and the treasure hunt to frame him. She had carefully filched enough cash to live on while she moved in anonymity to the Ozarks. When she was robbed of her money she contacted Desi Collings (Neil Patrick Harris) with whom she had a teenage affair and who remained desperately smitten to set her up in his remote lakeside villa. Watching Nicks declaration of love for her on tabloid TV Amy decided he might after all be the man for her. Now she just had to figure out a way to explain her disappearance. That meant finding a new male villain. ""Youre not too smart are you"" says sultry Kathleen Turner to full-of-himself William Hurt in the 1981 Body Heat. ""I like that in a man."" In that Lawrence Kasdan thriller the Turner character -- who plays games and goes missing -- has a temperature that runs ""a couple of degrees high around a hundred."" Amy is just the opposite a cucumber-cool conniver whose treasure hunt is among other things a test for Nick to see if hes as smart as he thinks he is. If so he might be a worthy companion after all suitable for siring a child -- another Amazing Amy? Amys life was always partly fiction from the time her parents wrote books about a fantasy image of their daughter She became an expert at live-action role-playing as a child as Desis lover then as Nicks one-and-only. If she twists her own original plot and returns to Nick hes bound to be as attentive as in their courtship. If not from gratitude then from fear she can find a way to do him in. Fincher tried a faithful version of a best-seller last time out with his Americanization of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. That was a stillborn exercise compared with Gone Girl which brings Nick and Amy to attractive plausible life and surrounds them with exemplary character actors. Kudos to Dickens to David Clennon and Lisa Banes as Amys parents. (Also noteworthy are Scoot McNairy and Lola Kirke as friends you might not want to meet on the road. Only Harris disappoints; he lacks the hovering menace and ultimate bafflement of a stalker-lover.) In Se7en and Fight Club Fincher proved his suave mastery of film violence; in Zodiac his way of clarifying the many clues in a murder thriller. As he showed in The Social Network the director also knows that no wound is more toxic than a friends betrayal. There will be blood in Gone Girl but some of the most startling moments are glancing -- Amys quick kiss that includes a lip bite -- and claustrophobic. What can be more ominous than the proximity of two people who are supposed to be in love but may have murder in mind? Any readers as they submerge themselves into a novel automatically make the movie version in their heads. They cast it too. For Gone Girl they imagined Affleck as the only Nick the way Gone With the Winds first readers preemptively saw Clark Gable as Rhett Butler. Good old Ben Affable with his softness and weaselly charm not to mention the cleft in his chin seemed an ideal fit for the likable not totally trustworthy Nick. The actor has played the bluff fervent lover before most notably in a terrific 1997 Kevin Smith rom-com called yep Chasing Amy; and in The Company Men he was the smug suburbanite who gets a comeuppance when he loses his job. Its no surprise that Affleck slips into the role with the nervous aplomb of a man who starts to realize that the stroll hes taking may lead to his own hanging. For Amy many readers envisioned Cate Blanchett or Charlize Theron; each could play a blond vixen capable of seducing and scaring a husband. But instead the role went to the lesser-known Rosamund Pike. (Among her roles in Hollywood films Andromeda in Wrath of the Titans and Tom Cruises helper in Jack Reacher.) Pikes relative unfamiliarity to the mass audience allows her to draw Amy in careful cursive on a blank slate. We know of Pikes Amy only what we see here She is pretty poised always alert ready to flash the witty remark that illuminates or scolds. She lives inside Amys brilliance suggesting that the sunniest face can harbor the darkest intent. In a movie of subtle tones and wild swerves Pike expertly mixes a cocktail of hot and cold blood. She is the Amazing Amy you could fall for till death do you part. Note An earlier version of this post misspelled the name of the actor Scoot McNairy.

First and foremost of course there are Nick and Amy Dunne the ickily perfect American couple whose marriage has gone badly south in the wake of the 2008 recession revealing their damaged and disordered souls. Nick and Amy are played in David Finchers eagerly awaited film adaptation by square-jawed Ben Affleck and ice-blond English actress Rosamund Pike - the latter as the imitation Grace Kelly we might say in an imitation Hitchcock movie. Every detail of Finchers filmmaking is so carefully managed that even the casting is revealing Affleck is a familiar and (mostly) beloved face to mainstream moviegoers while Pike despite a distinguished film and TV career across the pond is far more of an enigma. This shoves the movie away from the narrative ambiguity of Flynns novel in ways that may seem superficial but are actually profound.Alongside Nick and Amys ugly-beautiful faces we have nightmarish TV harridan and scold Ellen Abbott (Missi Pyle) a Nancy Grace-style legal pundit who serves as Nicks judge jury and would-be executioner in the court of public opinion. Theres also Desi Collings (Neil Patrick Harris) a St. Louis old-money socialite who has been obsessed with Amy since their prep-school days together; Andie (Emily Ratajkowski) a duplicitous and manipulative former student of Nicks; and Amys vampire-like parents Rand (David Clennon) and Marybeth (Lisa Banes) who cannibalized and massaged the details of her childhood into a beloved series of childrens books. Standing outside or above this freak show as a kind of Greek chorus or collective conscience are three sexless or androgynous commentators Celebrity defense attorney Tanner Bolt (wonderfully played by Tyler Perry of all people) no-nonsense small-town police detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) and Nicks tomboy sister Margo (Carrie Coon) who never wears anything but blue jeans and whose personality consists of nothing beyond Nicks better angels.Its already become famously difficult to review this movie which received its world premiere on Friday as the opening-night feature of this years New York Film Festival (and opens in theaters this coming Friday) without giving too much away. Despite the massive popularity of Flynns book a great many viewers will come to ""Gone Girl"" knowing little or nothing about Nick and Amys story and looking for a stylish Ben Affleck thriller. That too shapes the outcome. While Flynn herself wrote the screenplay (a mixed blessing I would say) the movie handles the storys nested switchbacks and revelations quite a bit differently than the novel does and ends up leaning pretty hard in Nicks direction.In both tellings Nick comes home to the couples suburban Missouri house one day to find Amy gone amid signs of a possible break-in and struggle. He immediately calls the cops claiming to have no idea what has happened to his wife or where she is. In a movie especially one with a handsome and likable star we are naturally inclined to treat what we see on the screen as objective reality whereas in Flynns novel we rapidly become alert to the fact that Nick is not an entirely reliable narrator and may be lying to us or to himself.In fact what the ever-slippery Fincher shows us in the first half of ""Gone Girl"" isnt always what ""really happened"" and he does make an effort to simulate Flynns back-and-forth between the colliding stories of Nick and Amy. As Nick comes slowly unglued in the media spotlight that descends upon North Carthage Missouri - its an unsolved crime involving a beautiful blonde and her smirking handsome husband - Amy through a series of diary flashbacks begins to unveil what went wrong in their seemingly ideal marriage and how they devolved from high-powered Manhattan media couple to unhappy unemployed denizens of a middle-American McMansion. But the major plot reversal comes much earlier in the movie than the book and barely seems like a surprise. Fincher is more interested in the metaphorical and satirical elements of ""Gone Girl"" as a cool dark Grand Guignol farce about the hazards of heterosexual marriage and the empty hungers of the media age than in the thriller plot which only barely holds together in the novel and entirely falls apart here.At times Flynn and Fincher seem to be in sync during ""Gone Girl"" and at other times they appear to be fighting each other to a draw. Amys famous diatribe against the archetype of the ""cool girl"" which delighted so many female readers becomes an insignificant throwaway here a bitter footnote seemingly inspired by her husbands specific misdeeds. Nick and Amys supposedly charmed New York existence barely figures in the film and never seems convincing; their literary meet-cute at some Brooklyn hipster party becomes an awkward scene out of some mediocre and earnest indie film rendered almost inaudible as if to mask the stilted dialogue. You can read this as part of Finchers design as an interpretation of these characters essential emptiness What Nick and Amy thought was a storybook Manhattan romance was nothing more than a hackneyed set of mannerisms. Indeed one way of understanding Flynns novel is as a neo-Henry James portrait of two monstrous people who can never escape each other with a page-turning mystery plot plastered on top. You Might Also Like Still its hard to avoid the conclusion that one character is a lot more monstrous than the other. ""Gone Girl"" has the good or bad fortune to arrive at a moment when theres considerable cultural discussion about misogyny and violence against women and to embody those themes - as a novel and screenplay written by an ambitious and talented young woman - in especially disturbing fashion. Its nearly impossible to discuss Amy or Rosamund Pikes chameleonic performance in any detail without giving away essential plot twists. Lets say this If Affleck as Nick is too unruffled too shallow then Amy is impossibly deep almost bottomless. In an opening voice-over Nick imagines cracking Amys skull open to read her thoughts and by the end of the story Flynn and Fincher dare us to sympathize with him. Pike may well get an Oscar nomination for this performance and I daresay she deserves it but not because Amy resembles a human being. She resembles about six of them as if Amy were a female archetype splintered into overlapping and competing personalities by the pressure of trying to live up to her beauty her blondness her wealth and her ""love affair"" with the ""perfect guy.""I suppose I found the gender politics of ""Gone Girl"" troubling on some levels and Fox is clearly hoping that a battle-of-the-sexes audience debate will sell tickets. But like all of Finchers movies this one is an intensely technical exercise steeped in cinema history including the history of cinematic misogyny. So the net effect is more like meta-troubling like a coldblooded and endlessly clever attempt to engage the outrage reflex and then undercut it. After Amy disappears Boney and her cop underlings find the first clue in her underwear drawer An envelope marked ""Clue One."" As we later learn those clues are a treasure hunt leading to a set of wooden Punch and Judy dolls stars of a medieval farce about a shrewish wife and her murderous husband. These dreamlike psychological symbols are drawn from Flynns novel to be sure but I found myself imagining a more nightmarish and unhinged version of Finchers film set free from the byways and detours of her screenplay that clearly do not interest him. Fans of the book I suspect will find themselves repeatedly frustrated by all the things the movie elides or omits; on the other hand a friend who hadnt read the book found key elements of the plot including its mordant conclusion almost incomprehensible. ""Gone Girl"" features a tremendous ensemble cast who mesh marvelously; its tough to pick favorites although Perrys calm funny deadpan lawyer and Dickens commonsensical and thoroughly unimpressed hometown cop are obvious choices. I would argue in fact that Afflecks bland characterization is a weak spot although that may reflect the way the films truncated narrative boxes him in. All the technical command of image sound and production design for which Fincher is justly famous is here as well. (As usual the cinematography is by Jeff Cronenweth the music by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross the editing by Kirk Baxter and the design team led by Donald Graham Burt.) Its a work of chilly wit and bleak metaphor an artifice that invites the kind of analytical response where we pull on our chins and discuss how other people more naive than we will receive it. My diagnosis is that its slightly too glib to be a great marriage drama and slightly too grim to be an Oscar contender. But to say this movie is soulless is descriptive rather than judgmental It depicts a world of naked stupid hunger where soulfulness has been stripped away and where all marriages end up in big empty houses of lies and betrayals with or without the police investigations and TV interviews and murder-groupies bearing casseroles of Frito-cheese.""Gone Girl"" opens nationwide Oct. 3.

Merrick Morton/Twentieth Century Fox hide caption toggle caption Merrick Morton/Twentieth Century Fox Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) finds himself the chief suspect behind the shocking disappearance of his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) on their fifth anniversary. Merrick Morton/Twentieth Century Fox At the opening of Gone Girl Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) is literally a man on the street. Standing by his trash cans in the half-light of an early morning at his gorgeous Missouri home in a T-shirt and sweatpants he is what might be mistaken for ""comfortable"" but he is painfully powerfully ordinary. And in keeping with the title he is about to learn that his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) is missing. Suspicious to both the authorities and the audience Nick has lost his wife to either an act of violence he committed or an act of violence he did not commit. He is no longer ordinary; he is either a monster or a misunderstood victim of circumstance. The story proceeds as a pair of alternating narratives We follow Nick in the present as he describes to the investigating officers a challenging but basically good marriage while Amy recounts in her diary in parallel a blissful courtship followed by increasingly dark flashes of trouble. We watch Nick tell the police and his sister things we know from peeking at Amys diary are not true. It begins to dawn in fits and starts that the Nick we saw standing in the street was not the entire Nick. It seemed almost impossible that director David Fincher and original novelist Gillian Flynn who wrote the adapted screenplay herself could hang on to the 2012 books uncommon and disorienting structure but they do. Seeing the film feels much like reading the book They achieve the same gasps the same moments of sudden and giddy understanding. They solve the problem inherent in every mystery that it will be solved but it cannot be until the final page because once it is the tension will slacken irreparably absent a series of false endings. In the film as in the book the opposite happens. Information is gained sometimes in sudden gulps but when it is there is no deflation -- only an exhilarating newness. The story calls for such unrelenting work with mood though that there are times when it feels in danger of stalling to gaze at its own blue-gray color palette. Fincher loves his Trent Reznor/Atticus Ross scores too and while the dreamlike woozy music in the first part of the film has just the right unnerving constancy it seems at times to admit too little silence. But if the production is slightly too atmospheric the performances are bracingly specific led by Affleck whose task is complex. What drives any effective portrayal of Nick is that you must be able to believe that he could be a malevolent sort of pent-up guy or he could be a middle-of-the-road lousy-husband guy or he could be a truly put-upon and largely blameless guy. You must no matter how hard you peer at him find it hard to tell. You must be unable to choose an answer even after you know the answer. He has to have an almost existentially untrustworthy quality so much so that you dont even trust any instinct you may have that hes not to be trusted. He has to be to Amy both charismatic and disappointing and he has to be to us maybe innocent and maybe guilty but naggingly unseemly either way. It is the greasy sheen on Nicks personality combined with something sympathetic in his insistence that hes innocent that makes the movie run. And that is where Ben Afflecks sweet spot is. Like Hugh Grant he flounders dully when people try to get him to play anybody too unambiguously nice; he leans on his grin and his ingratiating shrug and he gives off a generous whiff of distasteful entitlement. But allowed a bit of early-middle-age moping and resentment thats built into the character allowed to play a more questionable person hes more human. His work here is taut and controlled and he beautifully translates details from the book like Nicks tendency to smile at cameras even while surrounded by the theater of tragedy -- a tendency thats either an unfortunate disadvantage that makes him seem guilty or a crucial tell that he is guilty. (Seeing this kind of detail on screen -- the kind thats tough to understand until you see a living person do it -- goes a long way to justify the film adaptations existence.) Rosamund Pikes performance is much harder to talk about because shes the co-lead of the film despite the fact that Amy is gone. It is Amy who must come into focus gradually and it is Amy whose disappearance must eventually be solved and whose story will have to be closed from there. It is adequate to say that playing Amy in the dual narratives that she and Nick offer is an enormous challenge. Its not quite the pop-culture staple of Rashomon but reconciling Amy from Nicks telling and Amy from the diary -- and the two Nicks with whom those Amys live -- becomes key to understanding what happened to Amy and whether she will or will not ever be found. I think it is not spoiling too much to say that there are really two movies curled around each other in Gone Girl one part built on the tropes of mystery and one part drawn from the traditions of suspense and horror. There is more subtlety in the first more focus on the fine points of how marriages bend lovingly and warp dangerously. The second story is more an unsheathed weapon wielded extravagantly in which whatever is wrong whatever made Amy be gone must be confronted whether its internal or external to her husband. Finchers handling of both is appropriately creepy and nicely paced -- the movie is 2 1/2 hours long and never drags. While this is largely a two-person dance (of people spending much of their time apart) supporting performers including the fabulous Carrie Coon as Nicks fretting twin sister and a surprisingly relaxed turn from Tyler Perry as Nicks attorney put in good work. Neil Patrick Harris as a former boyfriend of Amys makes for an offbeat piece of casting given the other roles hes played and while its an almost impenetrable performance it seems intentionally so. But ultimately Gone Girl runs on the diabolical inventive sometimes unhinged genius of its story. It is constantly pressing on the edges of tropes until they show weakness -- the tough detective the dirty lawyer the sweet wife and worried husband -- and then cramming sticks of dynamite into the cracks and lighting them for kicks. Fincher being Fincher its a fine-looking carefully crafted meticulous piece of filmmaking full of shots that beg to be admired until they are almost but not quite ostentatious including the very first one of the film in which the back of Amys head is obliquely referenced as a thing to be cradled struck and ultimately dismantled -- the better to understand it of course. It is fine filmmaking. It is fine acting. But this is in the end a story-driven movie and what makes it work is that Flynn and Fincher together have told the ever-loving heck out of this scary weird tale with respect for the pitch-black (really really pitch-black) humor that occasionally oozes from its pores. They are acting here as social commentators on the topics of gender and marriage and media (its just hard to explore that without giving too much away) but theyre also acting as campfire legend-spinners. This one time there was this man and he called the police and said that his wife was missing.

From ""Fight Club"" to ""Se7en"" ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" to ""The Game"" and even fact-based features like ""Zodiac"" and ""The Social Network"" going in without knowing the outcome has proven to be the best way to approach a Fincher film. Finchers films have long rewarded his audiences with tricky clever surprises - from actual content to his often-unique narrative styles - but thats all changed with the directors latest film ""Gone Girl."" Based on Gillian Flynns best-selling novel of the same name (and get ready to read that phrase a lot more in the coming months as another one of Flynns novels is soon set to hit the big screen while yet another is going the television series route) ""Gone Girl"" is a rare bird a tricky weird mystery that benefits from people knowing its twist from the outset. Knowing whats ""really"" going on in the film may not be absolutely essential - Finchers dark-as-night humor and ability to build a hell of a thriller works for audiences who know whats going on just as well as they do for audiences that dont - but realizing what everything is building up to adds a layer of excitement anticipation and yes even some amusement thats quite special (and especially enjoyable). In the most basic (and spoiler-free) terms ""Gone Girl"" chronicles the sudden disappearance of Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) from her well-appointed Missouri home and the subsequent fall-out heaped on her husband Nick (Ben Affleck) from the media their families and a pair of sharp-witted detectives who never let up. Nick has some secrets - is one of them that he hurt Amy? - that make him act well a little funny once hes thrown into the spotlight as the country searches for his wife. Is Nicks bad behavior (he oddly smiles during a press conference he takes a selfie with a pretty stranger at the search teams headquarters he just doesnt seem all that concerned not to mention all that blood in the house) indicative of his guilt? Or is it proof that someone else is guilty of something much more cunning and evil? Flynns novel flips between narrator and time period allowing us to get to know both Nick and Amy through each others perspective and from their own words (Amy writes a diary and while putting that kind of stuff on screen can be hard Fincher does it with aplomb using it as a reliable method of flashing back). In order to understand what happened to Nick and Amy in the present we need to understand their past and Affleck and Pike do one hell of a job presenting a pair of people who - on the surface - seem wonderful and lovely and perfect while infusing them with a creepy menace that permeates even the most warm flashback. The real trick of ""Gone Girl"" isnt the twist - though thats a good one - its that both Nick and Amy are bad people. Terrible people really the kind of people capable of much more than a simple domestic disturbance and a little basic violence. Fincher bathes his film in dark colors sick yellows and plenty of shadows. Quick cuts zip us between scenes and characters and the effect is thrilling and unsettling and very exciting. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross score so overpowering and overbearing during its first few uses (the party scene where Nick and Amy meet is particularly prone to too much reliance on the chords) soon settles into itself and the discordant tones and creepy sounds help drive the narrative into ever-stranger territory. ""Gone Girl"" has been accused of being some kind of elevated trash a high brow Lifetime film but Fincher doesnt treat it that way and his audience shouldnt either. This is dark twisted stuff and Fincher approaches it with respect and reverence. Its just good. Affleck and Pike are both stellar as the dueling Dunnes - Pike in particular has long been due for a breakout role and this is definitely it - but the films supporting cast is one of the best assemblies in a film this year. Tyler Perrys work as defense attorney Tanner Bolt is confident assured and weirdly comforting. Kim Dickens Detective Boney is witty and wise and sharp as a tack with Patrick Fugit as Detective Gilpin easily slipping into the role of her slightly less-than foil. Both Carrie Coon (as Nicks sister) and Casey Wilson (as Amys best friend) make smallish roles feel big and strange and real richer than what the book has to offer. Neil Patrick Harris is saddled with one of the films toughest roles Amys ex-boyfriend Desi Collings and he balances between charm and smarm without batting an eyelash. Still ""Gone Girl"" comes down to its twist - one that shows itself just after the films first hour has ticked right past - and Finchers take on it (helped along by Flynns own script) remains faithful to the novel. Its the kind of twist that packs a punch both for those who know its coming and those who have only wondered when Finchers seemingly straightforward was going to take a flying leap into unknown territory. Its so wild and so wide and so wily that it can only force newbies to the material to re-evaluate what theyve just seen the very stuff that fans of Flynns novel has been smirking over for sixty or so minutes. But even knowing whats going to happen - or more precisely how its going to happen - doesnt dilute the thrilling voyeuristic power of a film so canny that even spoilers can only make it better.

Oh yes its very much by the book. But when the book is a brilliantly crafted page turner thats a good thing. Indeed fans of Gillian Flynns 2012 best seller about marital deceit will be gratified by this hotly anticipated adaptation (which premiered Sept. 26 at the New York Film Festival). And those coming in blind will behold mastery in the art of suspense. And what about the merits of that controversial final act? Well thats still up for debate. PHOTOS Celebrities Best Shapes Ever in Movie and TV Roles First we drop in on Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) and his beautiful wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) on their fifth wedding anniversary. Theyre the kind of couple who youd love to invite over for a dinner party Hes a laid-back Midwesterner and former magazine editor who recently opened a bar with his twin sister in his native Kansas City; shes a classy New Yorker and subject of the smash Amazing Amy kids books (written by her parents). You know them. You like them. It cant be understated how important it is to have relatable protagonists. On this day Nick comes home from work and sees a crime scene inside his nondescript suburban home. Amy is nowhere to be found. What happened? Surely the good-natured and cooperative husband so eager to please the detectives and the helpful locals couldnt have had anything to do with it. Or wait maybe hes just playing the role of the good-natured and cooperative husband. Affleck now in his 40s with grey-specked hair may not seem the obvious casting choice -- but few others could have put such an uncomfortably affable spin on this character. PHOTOS Best and Worst Movie Remakes Yet soon Nick becomes suspect No. 1 -- thanks in part to the court of media-led public opinion. (It wont take a HLN junkie to recognize the frighteningly accurate portrayal of our 24/7 consumption of white-collar murder. Missi Pyles brash Nancy Grace-esque cable anchor leads the brigade). The lead investigators meanwhile have uncovered the cracks in this loving marriage The duress started when the couple lost their jobs from the recession and Nick insisted that they uproot to Missouri so he could take care of his ailing mother. They also fought over whether to have kids to the point where he once shoved her to the floor. And perhaps most damning of all there is the matter of his extramarital affair. The evidence is all right there in colored ink in Amys journal. She wrote in it for years sharing her uncensored thoughts about the couples sexy courtship and their most bitter arguments. She never once told her husband about it but she narrates the details for us via telling flashbacks. PHOTOS 30 Most Romantic Movies of All Time Of course this is no perfunctory whodunit. Flynn who adapted her novel weaves an inspired maze of twists only for them to all lead to a complex meditation on contemporary marriage. As an added bonus she sufficiently modifies that muddled ending. (Though some might argue that she should have just scrapped it entirely). The film also benefits from an ace behind the camera as director David Fincher (The Social Network) creates a moody and engrossing sense of uncertainty throughout the 145-minute opus. One startling act of violence perfectly befits the man who once served us Gwyneth Paltrows head in a box in Seven. Theres just one quibble on The Girl herself. The elegant and statuesque Pike an unknown to most moviegoers certainly looks the part. Yet she plays Amy too icy in passages in which she needs to be flat-out sympathetic. Even during the couples genuinely blissful moments she lacks any semblance of a convincing spark with Affleck. Revealing anything more might result in a movie critics disappearance. Just know that this vital factor prevents a solid thriller from becoming a spectacular one.

By Anthony Lane ""Gone Girl"" directed by David Fincher is one of three new crime-thriller movies adapted from novels by popular authors.   Credit Illustration by Owen Freeman / Twentieth Century Fox Three happy marriages beginning to crack; three dissatisfied blondes; and crawling out from the cracks the thought of violent crime. Such is the substance of three new films all derived from works by popular authors. The longest is ""Gone Girl"" adapted by Gillian Flynn from her own novel; the most nattily dressed is ""The Two Faces of January"" taken from Patricia Highsmith; and last courtesy of Georges Simenon comes ""The Blue Room"" the Frenchest of the three so much so that the plot relies on confiture de prunes. ""Gone Girl"" directed by David Fincher starts with Nick (Ben Affleck)--in his own words ""a corn-fed salt-of-the-earth Missouri boy."" He used to live in New York and write for magazines but the work dried up and he returned home to the uneventful town of North Carthage with his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike). According to your point of view (and the film is all about viewpoints and the urge to shuffle them around) Amy is one or more of the following the inspiration for the ""Amazing Amy"" series of childrens books written by her parents; a flat-out dazzler too cool for the neighborhood; a rich kid spawned by a snotty family; the original desperate housewife becalmed and unadored; or a heap of trouble--the Clytemnestra of the Midwest. Oh and another thing. She may be dead. Nick owns a bar with his twin sister Margo (Carrie Coon) and he stops there one morning for an early Scotch. He then drives home to find the front door open a glass table smashed and no sign of his wife. Their cat is a witness but if it knows anything its not coughing up. The police arrive and Detective Boney (Kim Dickens) declares a missing-persons case; before long Nick is knee-deep in press conferences candlelit vigils and public appeals flashing a polite reluctant grin that is parsed by tabloids and TV hosts as proof of guilt. (You cant blame them. The Affleck smile from the dawn of his career has looked more creepy than consolatory--softening that firm all-American jaw but never quite reaching the eyes.) Suddenly after an hour we flip to Amy and to her version of what happened--so different and so close to wacko that it seems like another story altogether. I would happily unveil the rest of it but in deference to the twenty-one people who have yet to read the novel I will say nothing more without a lawyer present. At first blush ""Gone Girl"" is natural Fincherland. Not geographically; he seems less absorbed in North Carthage described by Amy as ""the navel of the country"" than he was in the California of ""Zodiac"" or the Harvard of ""The Social Network."" Those are his masterpieces the two movies that I cant not watch when they turn up on TV and the two occasions on which his pedantry and his paranoia have fused together engrossing us in a crazed aggregation of detail. Nothing could equip him better for the coiled and clustered goings on in the new film and for good measure he has hired Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross whom he last used for ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" to compose the score. They dont let him down. ""Gone Girl"" boasts one major act of savagery drenched in a downpour of blood and what we hear during it sounds like the wah-wah pedal of Satan. So why doesnt the movie claw us as ""The Social Network"" did? Who could have predicted that a film about murder betrayal and deception would be less exciting than a film about a Web site? The glum fact is that ""Gone Girl"" lacks clout where it needs it most at its core. We are accustomed to Finchers heroes being as obsessively smart as he is if lacking his overarching patience whereas Nick remains to put it gently a lunkhead. Amy has twice the brain and ten times the cunning but despite the best efforts of Rosamund Pike her character onscreen as on the page feels cooked up rather than lived in. That can work on film as shown by another beauty Gene Tierney in ""Laura"" and ""Leave Her to Heaven"" but the scheming of Tierneys heroines was matched by a rare ornate febrility in the movies themselves. Finchers method on the other hand is dogged and downbeat so that Amy sticks out like a cartoon in a newsreel. (One expected the same of the title character in ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" who was equally extreme but somehow Rooney Mara gave her life--all drilled intensity where Pike offers elegant drift.) ""Gone Girl"" is meant to inspire debates about whether Amy is victimized or vengeful and whether Nick deserves everything he gets but really who cares? All I could think of was the verdict of Samuel Butler on Thomas Carlyle ""It was very good of God to let Carlyle and Mrs. Carlyle marry one another and so make only two people miserable and not four."" Or in the words of Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry) Nicks unflappable attorney ""You two are the most fucked-up people I have ever met and I specialize in fucked-up people."" Perry has a grand time. His wave to the press corps camped out on Nicks sidewalk is a cool mixture of dismissal and salute. He knows that our attention is straying from the main couple toward the outlying figures Tanner himself Detective Boney and best of all Margo--a fine performance both grounded and wounded from Carrie Coon. Against that we have Desi (Neil Patrick Harris) a wealthy ex of Amys wandering in as if from another film and eating up the final slice of the action with a silly Gothic subplot. It comes straight from the novel and you can picture the outcry if Fincher had chopped or changed it but so what? A directors task is not to suck up to readers or to flatter his source but to imagine it afresh as film while seizing on those aspects that matter to him most. What grabs Fincher about ""Gone Girl"" I suspect is not the mystery in Missouri but the sight of a media wolf pack in full cry. Hence the time that he devotes to two cable-TV hosts played by Sela Ward and Missi Pyle who rifle through Nicks privacy and his state of mind in their lust for a story. Fincher is right these days they are the story and I wish that he would tell it again from their angle through the eyes of bloggers and via the phones of the people we see laughing outside Nicks bar taking selfies at a hot spot of fame. So ""Gone Girl Redux"" the campaign starts here. At one point in ""Gone Girl"" the preposterous Desi talks of quitting America for Greece. There a new life awaits--""Octopus and Scrabble"" he says. So much for the land of Plato. In ""The Two Faces of January"" much the same dream possesses Chester MacFarland (Viggo Mortensen) and his wife Colette (Kirsten Dunst) whom we meet at the Parthenon. The year is 1962 and they are clad like modern deities in creamy white--she in a dress and sun hat he in a crisp suit tie and shades. Typical American tourists of the time you presume noting the guidebook in his hand but this is a Patricia Highsmith fable which means that you would be wrong. Risking heresy I would argue that Hossein Amini the writer and director actually improves on Highsmith in these early scenes. She stresses in her first chapter that Chester is a fraud leaving behind him a trail of swindled investors and coasting through Europe on ill-gotten gains one step ahead of the law. Onscreen however that discovery is slow to come. Chester exudes such worldly charm that we take him on trust; how could he not be a gentleman inside and out? The role is deliciously ripe and ready for Mortensen who demonstrated in ""A History of Violence"" how the shell of a regular guy can be broken and peeled away and who times to perfection the hollowing out of Chester--a worried glance here a watery smile there. Even his hair brushed and waved at the start becomes a mussed-up clue flopping gray and sweaty over his brow. His very handsomeness is a mask. The MacFarlands have a couple of stalkers. One is a detective who confronts them in their hotel room and suffers the consequences. The other is Rydal Keener (Oscar Isaac) a Yale graduate turned scam artist acting as a tour guide first to rich American girls and second for more insidious reasons to Chester and Colette. He spirits them out of Athens to Crete and obtains false passports for them but why? Can he smell a profit? Is it because he wants Colette? Or because Chester reminds him of his father recently deceased? The magnetic pull of restless souls toward one another and thence into calamity was an abiding theme for Highsmith and Anthony Minghella caught it well in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley."" Amini lacks the daring of that film; he tamps down the sexual forces that should flame among the trio and the Cretan scenes grow strangely errant and flat. Even in the ruins of Knossos with a labyrinth of unease at his disposal Amini seems to lose the thread. Still there is beauty and perversity enough in the remainder of the movie and you should see it just for Chester--the adventurous sham running ever deeper into a maze of his own devising. The story goes like this Alfred Hitchcock calls Georges Simenon who is among the speediest and most prolific authors of the twentieth century with nearly four hundred works to his name. A secretary answers apologizes and explains that Monsieur cannot be disturbed because he has just started a new book. Hitch ""Thats alright Ill wait."" Untrue of course but apocrypha dont always lie. Simenon had a matchless ability to take the first narrative step without fuss and then to forge ahead as though beckoned by the destiny of his characters and that untiring purpose has proved invaluable to the movies. The list of his beneficiaries runs from Jean Renoir with ""Night at the Crossroads"" in 1932 to Bela Tarr and ""The Man from London"" in 2007 and now we have ""The Blue Room"" directed by Mathieu Amalric. The room in question is a bedchamber in a small provincial hotel where Julien played by Amalric meets his lover Esther (Stephanie Cleau)--only eight times but that is sufficient as Simenon fans will confirm to precipitate any mans ruin. The great virtue of the movie is its length a fat-free seventy-six minutes leaving ""Gone Girl"" which lasts almost two and a half hours looking dangerously bloated. To pass from the exploits of Nick and Amy to the worlds of Highsmith and Simenon is to trade contrivance however entertaining for something palpable reeking of moral seediness and disrepair. Julien like Chester and Rydal appears to behave as he chooses yet something deep in the natures of such men--the itch of recklessness the gluttonous demands of wallet and loins the mere wish to learn more--hurries them along their fateful paths. What we understand in retrospect is that they had no real choice at all. That is why Amalric following Simenons slippery example oils so smoothly back and forth in time. We see Julien on holiday at the beach with his wife the fair Delphine (Lea Drucker) and their daughter; we see him and Esther sprawled in bed perspiring; and in the wake of a killing that we dont yet comprehend we see him interviewed by a judge a psychiatrist and two cops who under French law are required to utter things like ""You say no other woman brought you the fullness of physical love."" These interrogations weigh too heavily on the film which could have been trimmed further still but I liked the fact that the walls of the courtroom where the case is tried are of the same midnight hue as those in the bedroom where the seed of the crime was sown. Blue is the warmest color and the coldest. Judgment matches desire.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Thats a steal from David Finchers mind-bomb of a movie ""Fight Club"" but it gets to the heart of the problem in talking about a film that many people are eventually going to want to argue about You cannot give anything away. So how now to write about this intricate puzzle of a movie without ruining it? Well the title character of the movie Amy is an over-achiever who likes to play treasure hunts. So here are the only hints Ill give you the dedicated movie lover. Its reminiscent of James M. Cain (but the novels not the films). Its a little like ""Vertigo"" (but with an entire extra third act). It builds on a lesson about flashbacks Alfred Hitchcock used to preach and maybe nods a bit to a certain Lawrence Kasdan picture. But its also its own thing. And its kind of terrific. The briefest summary of Gillian Flynns story -- and brief is definitely best -- is that one day handsome downwardly mobile Ben Affleck discovers his rich beautiful blond wife Rosamund Pike has disappeared. The police begin to investigate and we follow along. But the story immediately divides into two tracks -- one the present narrative in which we hear hubbys version of things. The second the past in which were privy to wifeys diary entries. And the best advice? Folks be very careful about believing either one of these people. Its a film full of great performances but selfishly I think first credit has to go to Affleck because Ive been sticking up for him for years -- even after ""Daredevil."" He is very good at a very specific kind of role a character that Bill Holden used to do to perfection -- the lucky hunk who realizes he doesnt deserve any of it -- and ""Gone Girl"" taps into that. Also (surprisingly) good is Tyler Perry playing it straight as a media-savvy lawyer; Carrie Coon from ""The Leftovers"" is marvelous too as Afflecks ferociously protective sister. And the gleaming perfectly groomed Pike is mostly wonderful as the missing woman while Neil Patrick Harris adds some humor as one of her old beaux. Perhaps too much humor and thats my one quibble -- what is and should be a very dark movie sometimes slips into smirking black comedy. Harris introduces some laughs and that seems to bring it out in Pike; Fincher clearly encourages it in their scenes together. Its a brief tonal shift but a significant one -- also helped along by some amusing but far-too-easy shots at tabloid TV screamers like Nancy Grace -- and its a bump the movie has to get over to get back to basics. But then it does with a vengeance. And even if the humor felt out of place to me I cant deny it got laughs from the audience - and was exactly what Fincher wanted. One of the most exacting of directors hes always in complete control. In fact the movie is a primer in how to make a movie from the hypnotic score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross to the unsettling sound mix to sudden striking visuals -- sugar dusting the air like snow crimson blood worn like war paint. As for deeper meanings though -- about marriage about misogyny about revenge about justice -- well those I cant talk about here. But believe me you should see the movie and then you can talk about it all night. And you probably will. Ratings note The film contains gory violence nudity sexual situations and strong language.

Starring Ben Affleck Rosamund Pike and Neil Patrick Harris. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews Gone Girl. Starring Ben Affleck Rosamund Pike and Neil Patrick Harris. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter All the fuss over GoneGirl film adaptation is justified says KennethTuran Based on a whopper of a bestselling novel (more than 2 million copies moved in the first year alone) with a major star in the lead and a top-of-the line director behind the camera the film adaptation of Gillian Flynns ""Gone Girl"" couldnt be a bigger deal. Which is why you are reading this review a full week before the films theatrical release.For so great has been the interest in this deliciously twisted David Fincher film starring Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike as the couple from hell that reviews are appearing nationwide to coincide with its Friday night world premiere as the prestigious opening event of the New York Film Festival. For once however all the fuss is justified. Superbly cast from the two at the top to the smallest speaking parts impeccably directed by Fincher and crafted by his regular team to within an inch of its life ""Gone Girl"" shows the remarkable things that can happen when filmmaker and material are this well matched.Fincher whose work can be gratuitously disturbing (""Seven"") as well as formally impressive (""The Social Network"") is by nature a chilly director a temperament that meshes well with the unsettlingly bleak view of human nature that ""Gone Girl"" is all about. Novelist and screenwriter Flynn must have been briefed by the Shadow himself about the evil that lurks in the hearts of men (and women) not to mention the lies manipulation and self-interest that live there too. But the fact that Flynns subjects are essentially love marriage and personal relationships gives ""Gone Girl"" a human connection that was absent in Finchers off-putting last work ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo."" Gone Girl trailer Gone Girl trailer by Twentieth Century Fox. Gone Girl trailer by Twentieth Century Fox. See more videos Sticking closely to Flynns dazzlingly complex plot and its cascade of surprises (there are so many that the two-hour-and-25-minute running time barely contains them) ""Gone Girl"" is the kind of portrait of a marriage that might have resulted if Alfred Hitchcock had watched a lot of Ingmar Bergman before getting down to work.The setting is the depressed but imaginary Midwestern town of North Carthage Mo. where Nick Dunne (Affleck) is introduced on July 5 also described in an on-screen title as ""the morning of.""Looking distraught and distracted Nick heads to The Bar a (what else but) bar he owns with his twin sister Margo (Carrie Coon) where he throws down an early-morning shot. Its a drink he will very soon be needing.

(Photo Merrick Morton / 20th Century Fox) For when Nick returns home on this his fifth wedding anniversary the door is open the living rooms glass coffee table has been reduced to fragments and his wife Amy (Pike) is gone gone gone.Quick on the scene are Det. Rhonda Boney (an excellent Kim Dickens) and Officer James Gilpin (Patrick Fugit the star of ""Almost Famous"" back in the day) who methodically go about trying to figure out what happened to Amy and who might be responsible for whatever that was.But that is only half of ""Gone Girls"" narrative. The film goes back and forth from the investigative present to extensive flashbacks of the past snapshots that are brought to life through Amys voice-over reading of her very personal diary.Back we go half a dozen years to Nick and Amy meeting in Manhattan two glib and verbal magazine writers who fall truly madly deeply in love and enjoy two blissful years of marriage doing movie things like making love in the back of a bookstore with no one around to notice. ""Were so cute"" Amy comments at one point in a typically tart Flynn line ""I want to punch us in the face.""The voice-over also lets us know that Amy is the model for Amazing Amy a mega-selling series of kids books written by her parents (David Clennon and Lisa Banes) about a character who succeeded where the real Amy often fell behind. The competition made the real Amy crazy but also left her with a healthy trust fund.Its at this point that reality intrudes. Both Nick and Amy lose their jobs her trust fund takes a hit his mother gets cancer and the end result is that the couple move to North Carthage Nicks hometown and a place that total New Yorker Amy simply cannot abide.Meanwhile in the day-by-day present Nick is starting to look more and more like a suspect (todays savage media circus is one of the films targets) partially because his frat-boy good looks and charm dont play well on the air.Affleck whos had his own personal deer-in-the-headlights moments gets Nicks combination of arrogance and likability exactly right and Pike (memorable in ""An Education"" and ""Jack Reacher"") is completely his equal in a performance that defies expectations at every turn.""Gone Girls"" twisty plot wouldnt be as effective as it is if the casting of all the subsidiary characters werent as good as the leads and Laray Mayfield who has cast Finchers films since 1999s ""Fight Club"" has done a superb job placing actors like Neil Patrick Harris Tyler Perry Missi Pyle Emily Ratajkowski and Casey Wilson as well as Coon Dickens Fugit Clennon and Banes in this intricate mosaic. The same is true for Finchers veteran production team including cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth editor Kirk Baxter production designer Donald Graham Burt costume designer Trish Summerville and the music and sound design team of Trent Reznor amp; Atticus Ross and Ren Klyce.

(Merrick Morton/Twentieth Century Fox) Rosamund Pike as Amy Dunne in Gone Girl (Merrick Morton/Twentieth Century Fox) Carrie Coon l. and Ben Affleck play siblings in Gone Girl. (Merrick Morton/Twentieth Century Fox) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday September 25 2014 500 PM Title Gone Girl Film Info With Ben Affleck Rosamund Pike. A husband is a suspect when his wife disappears. Director David Fincher (225). R Violence sexuality language. Area theaters staring Oct. 3. Opens the New York Film Festival tonight. ""Gone Girl"" David Finchers hypnotically great movie is a break-all-the-windows plot-twister that keeps every jolt and (most of) the cultural jabs from Gillian Flynns blockbuster novel. Yet in its twisted little gut this dramatic thriller is just as notable for addressing how relationships can force a change in people that may not always be welcome. That explains why Flynn has said tongue in cheek that the movie could ""break up couples nationwide."" The book uses the alternating voices of Nick Dunne and his wife Amy (via her diary entries) adding up to two versions of their courtship and marriage. Flynns savvy screenplay repeats the trick. As the film glides back and forth from Nicks story to Amys there are subtle juxtapositions and wicked ones as when a deep first kiss is followed by a shot of Nicks throat being swabbed for forensic evidence. On the afternoon of their fifth wedding anniversary Nick (Ben Affleck) enters their Carthage Mo. home to find a smashed coffee table but no trace of his wife. He calls the police and detectives Boney (Kim Dickens) and Gilpin (Patrick Fugit) find blood in the kitchen and a blunt instrument in the fireplace. As Nick falls under increasing scrutiny from cops the town and the media entries from Amys diary reconstruct their shared past How at a Brooklyn mixer the Midwest-raised pop-culture writer met the daughter of childrens-book authors who based a popular character after their child. After they married Amy (Rosamund Pike) a deviser of quizzes for womens magazines constructed maddeningly elaborate anniversary ""treasure hunts"" for Nick. They continue even after they both lose their New York jobs and relocate to Nicks hometown to help his twin sister Margo (Carrie Coon) with their ailing mother. They use Amys trust fund to open Nick and Margos bar and endure their marriages dashed expectations. Amy it turns out left behind some final anniversary clues that intrigue Boney and Gilpin. The clues incriminate Nick whose laid-back glib nature doesnt help him any. After damning new evidence is revealed Nick hires flashy celebrity defense lawyer Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry). Bolts strategy Get ahead of any bad revelations still to come. But that has risks as well and theres a doozy right around the corner. The film involves much more -- including a slimy rich guy (Neil Patrick Harris) with an Amy fixation -- but its hard to talk about ""Gone Girl"" without giving away its secrets. (The books fans may note some alterations in the second half.) Yet this isnt ""Jagged Edge"" or ""Presumed Innocent"" in Gen-X clothing. There are smart observations here about strangeness in pretty packages and how the ugly 24-hour news cycle always needs recranking. When Finchers involvement was announced ""Gone Girl"" immediately graduated from publishing phenom to something bigger. A detail-oriented moviemaker with a taste for delicious mysteries (""Seven"" ""Fight Club"" ""Zodiac"" ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"") he earned Best Director Oscar nominations for ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" and ""The Social Network"" films with no violence but plenty of seriously chilly insight. Ben Affleck with Tyler Perry who plays a big-time defense attorney in Gone Girl (Merrick Morton/Twentieth Century Fox) That continues with ""Girl"" and the stars help bring it into focus. Affleck in the midst of a successful career reboot (last year ""Argo"" next year ""Batman vs. Superman"") walks a taut razor line here between flabbergasted fearful and fuming (early on you even feel Nick tamping down the need to be funny). Nicks not an underdog but this is a story where almost everyone alternates between hero and villain. Affleck subverts his charm just enough to guide us to the storys dark heart. Pike -- a British actress best known for the 2002 James Bond film ""Die Another Day"" and 2012s ""Jack Reacher"" yet was also terrific in ""An Education"" and ""Barneys Version"" -- has an icy beauty that can be heated to scalding in a heartbeat. As we slowly learn about the diamond-faceted Amy a lot of layers must be peeled back. Pike pulls it off flawlessly. The supporting cast is uniformly terrific with Perry giving a gaspingly good performance and Harris providing a snide venality. Fugit and crucially Dickens are notable as anchors of justice. Coon makes the biggest impression in the crucial role of Nicks wry moral-umpire sister who gets caught up in the maelstrom. But the biggest star here may be Finchers surgically precise insight and silky style of suspense which makes this film a modern companion to such classics as Hitchcocks ""Vertigo"" and Clouzots ""Diabolique."" Fincher is a fearless filmmaker who understands his audiences intelligence (not to mention their cinematic blood lust). By the end of ""Gone Girl"" we feel like weve lived through about four movies not just one.

But at the end of the perfect murder all youre left with is a corpse and thats about all Gone Girl -- which opens the New York Film Festival this Friday to be followed by a nationwide opening October 3 -- leaves you with too. The story as Flynn lays it out both in her book and in the screenplay she adapted from it is intended to be cold and perverse a chilly bit of business exploring the ways in which men and women -- or at least this particular man and woman -- fail to communicate. The movie while entertaining and extremely well crafted is too self-conscious about its depravity to be either truly disturbing or disturbingly funny. Ticking along with metronome-like efficiency its more slick than sick. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Ben Affleck plays Nick Dunne a frustrated husband and former big-city magazine writer who has moved back to his Missouri hometown to care for his cancer-stricken mother. His mother has since died and though hes forged a not-unsatisfying career running a local bar with his twin sister Margo (Carrie Coon) the being-a-husband part has proved much harder. Nick just doesnt seem to like his wife very much as he makes clear in the movies opening voice-over recited archly over a lingering shot of a womans very blonde tresses ""I imagine cracking open her head unspooling her brain trying to get answers.""Brrr and then some. We soon meet this wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) one of those gleaming casually graceful beauties for whom the adjective patrician was invented. When Amy and Nick first met back in New York in 2005 they were blissfully happy; Amy recounts as much in a diary entry written with a girly-girl pen topped with a furry tuft. Even the first few years of their marriage were joyful In flashback we see them making love amid the shelves of a Manhattan used bookstore. Its hard to know if in Finchers hands thats supposed to be funny but no matter what its enough to make you think twice about picking up that sweet little volume of Leaves of Grass whose only flaw is a few stuck-together pages.Film Details Gone Girl RatingR GenreSuspense/Thriller Running Time145 More Info Trailer Now though as Nick and Amy hit their fifth anniversary theres no glue between them beyond resentment. Even so in keeping with a tradition she began early in their marriage Amy has planned a treasure hunt for her once-dear hubby. But even before he finds the first clue he stumbles upon a miserable surprise His wife has disappeared leaving behind an unironed anniversary-date dress a living room in a shambles and a kitchen floor that looks clean to the naked eye but really isnt. The cops pretend to help him but the detectives on the case played by Kim Dickens and Patrick Fugit treat him as a suspect from the first minute. Before long the whole town hates him particularly its XX denizens. ""Im so sick of being picked apart by women"" Nick grouses to Margo presumably a sample of the misogynist tomcat pee hes been spraying around his wife these past few years.All is not as it appears -- except it sort of is. Gone Girl is a story of myriad twists and turns none of which can be revealed here. If youve read the book youll probably want to know that Fincher has honored all of its significant plot points including the ending (even if perhaps hes taken minor liberties with its tone). If youre a Gone Girl virgin you wont care about that stuff but its worth noting that Fincher -- as youd expect from the filmmaker behind Zodiac and the even better Girl with the Dragon Tattoo -- manages to braid the novels Rapunzel-like strands into characteristically graceful plaits. You probably wont know what will happen next until it actually happens. Gone Girl is fun while it lasts. And if you go to the movies to admire performances and craftsmanship theres plenty to go around Afflecks Nick is a roiling blob of rage locked in a mans skin. He struts through the movie like an Abercrombie amp; Fitch caveman -- his shirts are all a little bit too tight as if they can barely contain his muscles or his pride. Pike may not be quite as well cast -- shes so marble-smooth that her fellow actors dont so much interact with her as slide off all that polished golden surface -- but maybe her coolness works in her favor. Were not really supposed to know her so her Sphinxlike anonymity doesnt matter so much.But even though Gone Girl works hard to mess up our heads with all manner of he-said she-said curlicues and features one grisly blood-spraying murder sequence it still doesnt feel as dangerous as it should. The problem lies with the source material. (And heres where youll want to stop reading if youre not familiar with the novel.) Flynns clever plotting makes the book engaging. But the noir femme fatale shes created leaves a lot -- in fact everything -- to be desired. We hear this woman talk so much that we know exactly how and why shes as bad as she is. The great femme fatales -- the characters played by Barbara Stanwyck in Double Indemnity and by Jane Greer in Out of the Past to name just two -- have been the creations of men irresistible dream girls onto which men can project their fears and longing. Thats whats great about them Theyre bad for their own bad sake and to watch them do their dirty work is at once thrilling and threatening and freeing. But Flynns anti-heroine is all motivation and not enough being. Shes bad because shes angry in that supposedly universal angry-woman way. And that cant hold a candle or the flicker-flame of a gold-plated lighter to being bad because it feels so damn good.2 Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Stephanie Zacharek Follow szacharek Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Entertainment ""Gone Girl"" Is Now A Sleek But Hollow Movie Director David Fincher and stars Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike have made a film adaptation that feels nastier and less balanced than Gillian Flynns novel. Warning Minor spoilers ahead Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Rosamund Pike and Ben Affleck in Gone Girl Merrick Morton Twentieth Century Fox/Regency Enterprises ID 3867407 Gone Girl is a story about marriage and how every union requires its share of communication and compromise. That this is like calling Psycho a movie about a man with a conflicted relationship with his mother doesnt make it any less true. Entertainment Weekly journalist-turned-novelist Gillian Flynns compulsively readable 2012 best-seller is known for its corrosive wit and dark twists including the doozy that will be left unspoiled here but its the way that its lurid developments have their roots in recognizable wedded dramas that makes the novel so much more than your typical airport thriller. The book makes the reader play marital ref between thirtysomething couple Nick and Amy Dunne as the two take turns telling the story of their five-year-long marriage each presenting him- or herself as the more sympathetic character and each turning out to be awful in different ways. And now Gone Girl is a movie opening in theaters Oct. 3 directed by David Fincher (The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo The Social Network) and adapted for the screen by Flynn herself. Starring Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike with buttery cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth and a score from the Oscar-winning combo of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross its the kind of adaptation that signals in a thousand ways how its determined to get things right. And when there are so many smaller details including its casting its submerged but scathing sense of humor and its dead-on portrayal of the economically devastated Missouri town of North Carthage in which its set that are perfect it can feel grouchy to complain. But on screen Gone Girl differs in a fundamental and worrisome way from the text. It no longer feels like a narrative duel between Nick and Amy -- it feels like a story about the crazy thing that happens to Nick. ID 3866426 Merrick Morton Twentieth Century Fox/Regency Enterprises Merrick Morton Twentieth Century Fox/Regency Enterprises ID 3868244 Flynn is impressively efficient at trimming and packing down her book into something feature-length and you can see how the shift in focus happened on a basic streamlining level. Nick (Affleck) is the one whos there as the movie opens as he returns to the immaculate suburban house he shares with Amy his partner in an increasingly troubled marriage. Hes the one things happen to because Amy as promised in the title is gone and likely to no place good. Thirty years old a failed magazine journalist who moved back home to the Midwest with his less-than-enthusiastic wife in order to help care for his cancer-stricken mother Nick is an easygoing local boy who likes to think of himself as a nice guy even if he doesnt always act that way. But when he discovers his wife is missing and there are signs of a struggle in the house an investigation is launched that garners national attention and then starts to target Nick as the main suspect in her disappearance. Nick is an ideal role for Affleck whose cheesecake handsomeness (his cleft chin is part of a repeated motif) can have a dissolute air -- hes a man whos done a lot of coasting by on his charm and the indulgences of women without really registering it. Placed in the spotlight Nick struggles to play the grieving husband correctly -- should you smile when asked to pose for a photo by your wifes ""missing"" poster? When he woodenly recites a plea for information at a press conference even his supporters begin to doubt his innocence. Nick has a temper. He tends to look smug not appropriately upset and when questioned by detectives Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) and Jim Gilpin (Patrick Fugit) he has no idea what Amy does all day while hes working at the bar that he owns with his twin sister Margo (The Leftovers Carrie Coon a standout). And maybe theres no right way to act when a million cameras are capturing your every move when a Nancy Grace-like TV personality (Missi Pyle) preemptively declares your guilt and when you hire a famous defender of scumbags (Tyler Perry looking more at ease than he ever has when not in character as Madea) to be your lawyer. ID 3867934 View this image > Merrick Morton Twentieth Century Fox/Regency Enterprises ID 3868383 Meanwhile Amy (Pike) in flashbacks recounts her side of the story by way of her diary presenting her giddy first meeting with Nick at a party in New York their lives together an abbreviated urban romance that gives way to the harsher realities of unemployment their move and Amys growing sense of estrangement from and fear of the man she married. Shes a little too perfect in her telling if also a bit remote -- a martyr to the marriage shes fighting to save a fragile blonde gamely warding off doubts that her husband would ever do her harm. (Pike is good but shes a little too aristocratic for the role.) Everyone gets to show themselves in their preferred light when theyre the ones in charge of the telling. Its a narrative device thats central to Gone Girl in book form but one that the movie lets half slide. Amy narrates some of her sections in voice-over including a nod to the ""cool girl"" section thats the novels most caustic lingering part. Nick does not. His parts marked on the page by elisions and half-lies and defensiveness become the movies own point of view -- theyre presented as fact. We might doubt his trustworthiness as a character but we never get a chance to do so as a narrator which isnt the case for Amy whose sections are marked as subjective in a way that Nicks arent. Fincher directs Gone Girl with a glossy elegance -- the coolness of his touch as a director lends itself well to this story of unlikable people. But the end result is a movie thats closer to his stylish but hollow The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo than with his more virtuoso work like Fight Club. Its not just that Gone Girl lacks the conviction of its own nastiness -- its simply not the toxic soulmate saga that its source material is a brilliantly cynical take on what it means to put effort into your relationship. Instead Gone Girl feels more like the story of someone whos gotten involved with a sociopath and given the dark places it goes in its second half (which features an instance of stunningly staged violence) this imbalance makes the film feel like it has absorbed the edge of misogyny shown by some of its characters. After all marriage is about a union between two people not one person trapping another -- even if youre depicting that solidarity in the most bitterly ironic sense.

Our first instinct when a beloved book is turned into a movie is to get up on our hind legs and anticipate all the ways that Hollywood will get it wrong. Two summers ago you couldnt walk through an airport or ride the subway without spotting half-devoured copies of Gillian Flynns bruise-black thriller Gone Girl everywhere you looked. And for good reason. It was the rare page-turner that balanced beautiful writing breathless pacing and booby-trap plot twists that landed with the brass-knuckle force of a sucker-punch. Not surprisingly it was quickly optioned and fast-tracked into one of the most eagerly anticipated films of the fall with David Fincher behind the camera and Flynn (a former EW colleague of mine) adapting her own story for the screen. There were reasons to be wary of course. Was Ben Affleck too smug--and lets face it too on-the-nose--to play the callow Nick Dunne? Was Rosamund Pike too icily ethereal and untested to play his missing wife Amy? And how would the film handle the novels just-short-of-preposterous Big Reveal? Well the answers are no no and...masterfully. Fincher and Flynns film gets just about everything right. Its hard to discuss a movie like Gone Girl without giving too much away. (There must be some people out there who havent read it yet right?) But Ill try anyway. Both a bleak snapshot of modern love gone toxic and a razor-toothed satire of tabloid-era sensationalism Finchers film tells the nightmare story of Nick and Amy Dunne a fairy-tale couple whose marriage has soured into a curdled stew of resentment hostility and possibly murder. On the morning of their fifth anniversary Amy disappears from their suburban Missouri home leaving behind upturned furniture shattered glass and traces of blood. Nick a self-absorbed bar owner whos curiously unflustered by his wifes absence quickly becomes the polices prime suspect. His alibi is hardly airtight; worse Amys diary paints him as unfaithful and short-tempered. Is she dead or just simply...gone? Weve all seen this sort of scenario on countless fearmongering episodes of Dateline and The First 48. But what makes Gone Girl so intoxicating is the way the mystery unfolds. As Nick explains his side of the story to a pair of detectives (Kim Dickens and Patrick Fugit) who arent buying what hes selling the missing Amy tells hers through voice-overs and flashbacks. The movie asks How much did Nick know about his wife? But what its really asking the audience is How much do any of us know about our partners? As Nick Affleck gives what may be the most natural performance of his career. Hes confident without being cocky charming without being smarmy. You get the sense that his cruel season under the medias magnifying glass with J. Lo wasnt entirely for naught. And as Amy Pike summons levels of depth and daring shes never been asked to grapple with before. Fincher uses the same deliberateness with every casting choice in the film. As Nicks sister Margo Carrie Coon gives the film its gallows humor and spikiest laughs and Tyler Perry is the epitome of calculating oiliness as Nicks high-priced defense attorney. (Who knew?) Conducting it all like a true-crime Toscanini is Fincher--a mischievious maestro who turns the film into the puzzle-box workout that his 1997 brainteaser The Game wanted to be. I cant guarantee that the films ending will work for everyone (it was always my one nit to pick with Flynns novel). But I will say this Anyone who loved Gone Girl the book will walk out of Gone Girl the movie with a sick grin on their face. You can stop being nervous.

This mix of the violent and the ruminative is typical of director David Finchers adaptation of Gillian Flynns bestselling novel a missing-person thriller in which a given characters status as victim or villain changes from one scene to the next. ""What have we done to each other? What will we do?"" Nick asks more than once about his significant other who vanishes under curious circumstances on the day of their fifth wedding anniversary; that such questions manage to feel vaguely romantic in spite of their troubling subtext is a credit to Fincher whos made a habit (if not a career) of elevating questionable source material. READ MORE Trent Reznor Previews Gone Girl Soundtrack On Nine Inch Nails Website While not uncooperative in the wake of his wifes sudden disappearance Nick is aloof enough to arouse suspicion among those expecting more outward displays of emotion. He always seems to be holding something back and Finchers clinical control doesnt allow us to get any closer to the truth than Nick is willing to show at least in the early goings. With no news of Amys whereabouts and no credible suspects all eyes thus turn to him. ""Im so sick of being torn apart by women"" he says in the midst of this ordeal; between his wifes damning journal entries the prying inquiries of her cases lead detective (Kim Dickens) and the Nancy Grace-like television host convicting him in the court of public opinion every day its an understandable sentiment. Its also part of an unfortunate pattern in which Nick is gradually made to seem more trustworthy as the women around him become less so. In its incremental reveal of key details and wrenching scenes of townsfolk fruitlessly combing the landscape for someone who isnt there ""Gone Girl"" is sporadically reminiscent of ""Exotica"" and even the original ""Paradise Lost"" documentary. At other times itll have you wondering why Fincher went even further down the Barnes amp; Noble rabbit hole than he did in his 2011 adaptation of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo."" Few filmmakers take as meticulous a behind-the-camera approach to their work as he does and the fact that hes so enamored of pulpy bestsellers lately isnt altogether surprising given his impressive track record with similar material in the past. Still its hard to shake the notion that he could be doing something more rewarding than becoming the preeminent director of airport-novel adaptations a trajectory thats all the more disappointing after the trifecta of ""Zodiac"" ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" and ""The Social Network."" Fincher likely prides himself on turning coal into diamonds at this point but Flynns script can feel so retrograde at times that one wonders whether it might have been better served by a De Palma Bigelow or even a Verhoeven -- which is to say a filmmaker less concerned with making the lascivious seem prestigious. (Its doubtful anyone else could have filmed a certain blood-soaked scene with such unsettling verve however.) In addition to being a mystery with dubious gender politics ""Gone Girl"" is also an examination of an irresponsible media and scandal-hungry public. The truth matters less than how it comes across on primetime and the fact that Nick and Amys troubles stem from a depressed economy (both lost their jobs in New York expediting their move to Missouri where Nicks mother was dying of cancer) never makes it to air. Neither of them is the person he or she hoped to be and their disappointment in both themselves and their better half expresses itself in increasingly volatile ways. Their differing accounts of how this came to be are likely to balkanize viewers leaving them at a loss as to whether husband wife or neither deserves our trust. Few of our first impressions of the unhappy couple reflect the full view of things which isnt to say that they develop into especially dynamic characters. Pike is phenomenal as the enigmatic Amy but shes written in such a way that she somehow becomes less three-dimensional as the film goes on -- shes demonized rather than sympathized. Nick maintains his innocence even while readily admitting that hes been a lousy husband and things between him and Amy may well have been over long before she went missing. Marriage is a primal battle of the sexes in ""Gone Girl"" one in which both sides play dirty and any victories are pyrrhic. Surviving isnt the same as winning and getting through this provocative problematic thriller sometimes feels like a war unto itself. Grade C+ ""Gone Girl"" will have its world premiere as the opening night film at the New York Film Festival on Friday. It opens nationwide on October 3.READ MORE Gone Girl Inherent Vice and More Teased in New York Film Festival Trailer This Article is related to Reviews and tagged Ben Affleck-2 David Fincher Gillian Flynn Gone Girl-3 New York Film Festival Reviews Rosamund Pike More From IndieWireRosamund Pike and Daniel Bruhl To Star In Palestinian Hijacking Drama EntebbeBoJack Horseman Brilliantly Argues Why Comedy Belongs in the Abortion DebateNew York Film Festival Announces Mike Mills 20th Century Women As Centerpiece SelectionAva DuVernays Netflix Documentary The 13th Will Open 54th New York Film Festival Comments Shashwati T May 12 2016 827 pm demonized rather than sympathized oh pish posh Wish John Waters had directed this film. Reply Mathilde May 12 2016 827 pm The book was total crap but written by an Entertainment Weekly writer - which means the crap part was understandable and so is the bias by all TW publications too. Logrolling in our time. If all Fincher wants to do now is adapt crappy best-selling books like this one and remaking Girl with a Dragon Tattoo (which didnt need remaking) he needs his own McConaissance. Reply Ben May 12 2016 827 pm Lets not forget that half of the fantastic game changing movies Ficher has released have been based of books. Fight club- book. Zodiac- book. Curious case- book. Social network- book etc. Reply Kerry May 12 2016 827 pm I agree that Fincher was an inappropriate choice for director. All he really brought to the film was his name. The film didnt need carefully structured cleverness it needed edginess. Reply JD May 12 2016 827 pm Wow TJ could you sound any more pretentious? The book was great and the term ""airport-novel"" is cringe inducing. Reviewer seems off base compared to the others. Reply Corey May 12 2016 827 pm I have not yet seen the film; however this review does not appear to say much more than vague blanket statements. HOW is Flynns script ""retrograde""? WHY are the gender politics ""dubious""? A critic should be able to explain these things. Reply Paul May 12 2016 827 pm TJ Hill is a moron.. thats all Reply Aaron May 12 2016 827 pm This movie is NOT getting rave reviews. Just thought that needed to be pointed out for some of the fangirls of the book and of Fincher. Reply Heidi Haaland May 12 2016 827 pm A David Fincher C+ = most anybody elses A-. Fie Indiewire Reply Jared May 12 2016 827 pm Perhaps next time actually review the film instead of the pondering the filmmakers choices of what material they decide to direct? Getting movies made is a tough business As we saw what with Fincher and 20000 Leagues. Film critics are to review what did get made not waste our time with what might have been. Reply Jimmy H May 12 2016 827 pm Gotta take issue with you bad-mouthing ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"". Youre probably trying to burnish your bona fides with some group or other by playing the contrarian in this review. However TGWTDT was a fine book made into a fine film by Mr. Fincher. Just because something is popular doesnt mean its not worthwhile. I suspect that ""Gone Girl"" is another fine film by Fincher. You may score some points with a particular segment of critics with this review. But its worth remembering that it takes very little to criticize a creative work while the work itself requires tremendous effort. Reply Guillo19 May 12 2016 827 pm EW Total Film and Empire Online are all praising the film so I guess it is a matter of opinion. I feel it is dismissive to criticize the director for choosing popular novels to adapt into films. TGWTDT is a terrific film even better than the Swedish one so I guess Ill see for myself Reply lydia May 12 2016 827 pm since ALL the other reviews are RAVE reviews after throwing out the highest and lowest scores it still averages out a rave review. cant wait to see it Reply Marc Schenker May 12 2016 827 pm Ill just go back to the top now where I can enjoy your cutofftypeinmovingboxes. Reply Marc Schenker May 12 2016 827 pm I forgot to mention the fact that the 15-year old who wrote this ""review"" is right in line with the rest of the kids who do it here. Indiewire you are the most pretentious movie site on the internet. And thats the good part. Where does it say Leonard Maltin hooks up with infants? Reply Marc Schenker May 12 2016 827 pm And I thought the whole point of the movie was to show everyone who abandoned the book that they were right who gives a shit about two self-absorbed dilatants who have nothing to say of any interest written in a style reminiscent of my 12-year olds book reports. I thought Fincher was giving the middle finger to just about everyone here. Good for him. Reply anonymous May 12 2016 827 pm ""Articles like these just continue to suggest that Indiewire is far too political to be objective critics of art. All they care for these days seems to be gender politics and LGBT filmmaking."" If you talk about gender at all there is always someone who thinks that is too much. Reply John May 12 2016 827 pm Hey Bob you havent seen the movie but you agree with indiewires review.Youre a funny guy Reply Curtis OBryant May 12 2016 827 pm I respect your opinion but the movies is getting flat out rave reviews from other critics. Reply Vazir May 12 2016 827 pm Sounds like a lame story. Does Fincher just make these movies for the box office draw at this point? Reply VCQ May 12 2016 827 pm And we should believe or give credence to this reviewer who gave ""Riddick"" a B+?? I dont think so Reply sylvrock May 12 2016 827 pm ""whos made a habit (if not a career) of elevating questionable source material."" That kind of comment makes me think that the author has no particular respect or attraction for Finchers filmographie so I wont take this review too seriously... Reply Oracle May 12 2016 827 pm Fincher excels at the basics music videos tv advertisements best seller adaptations and remakes of international tv series. There is no question that he is meticulous and the finished version of whatever it is that hes doing is polished. I still cant get excited about his work. Hes like the best version of a B-list filmmaker. He needs to up the ante. No more remakes of adaptations. No more adaptations. Sit down and write something original or film something original that someone else wrote. Take a risk dude. Reply sean May 12 2016 827 pm The novel started out so promising and then limped along to a ridiculous and eyerolling ending. Many of Finchers films do the same so I think hes actually a perfect choice. Reply Corvo May 12 2016 827 pm No Oscar material here. I was expecting that. Maybe Pike could sneak in but she cant win over Moore Jones and Adams. Fincher wont get a nod. Reply David Fincher May 12 2016 827 pm All I make are book adaptations or US remakes of British series. Reply LH May 12 2016 827 pm This book was not airport pulp fiction. It was a very well-crafted novel that got a rave from the New York Times and a handful of literary awards. Reply lulu May 12 2016 827 pm very weak review of a hugely anticipated movie lots of unsubstantiated judgement and little expansion thats rooted in the actual movie. Even your heading is off hasnt Fincher been exploring media hysterias for the last few years? Sounds like the musings of a moviegoer who maybe missed the point. Reply Lori May 12 2016 827 pm I am still going to see this movie. If it paints the characters half as good as the book its worth seeing. I have been waiting for this one Reply Joe May 12 2016 827 pm Clearly yall were hoping for another film that villainized the man and victimized the woman. How cliche. Articles like these just continue to suggest that Indiewire is far too political to be objective critics of art. All they care for these days seems to be gender politics and LGBT filmmaking. Reply TJ Hill May 12 2016 827 pm The material and the trailer seems boring. I too wish Fincher would a more interesting book to adapt than these privileged ""airport novels"". Reply Bob May 12 2016 827 pm Sounds not good to me..well i agree with Indiewire C+ Reply William May 12 2016 827 pm Fk you Indiewire Reply Vanessa W May 12 2016 827 pm Um...the whole point of the novel (and now the movie) was that no character is sympathetic.

Its a hypnotically perverse film one that redeems your faith in studio smarts (but not alas in local law enforcement tabloid crime reporting or indeed marriage). No secrets will be revealed here apart from an obvious one Director David Fincher also the maker of Seven Zodiac and The Social Network is more than just your everyday stylish cynic. Five years of matrimony havent been kind to the Dunnes a pair of formerly dazzling NYC writers rocked by layoffs family illness and a resentful move to a Missouri dead zone. We learn this early on after the disaster that kicks off the movie Nick (Ben Affleck never better) stops home after a neighbor phones him about his cat thats slipped out the front door. Inside he finds shattered glass everywhere but no Amy (Rosamund Pike delivering a ghostly yet dominant turn thats the years biggest surprise). Has she been snatched? Cops gather along with news trucks Amys snobby Manhattan parents and a dawning sense of media frenzy in need of a culprit. Nick whos a touch too aloof comes in handy in this regard. Toggling between the developing investigation and flashbacks to the couples happier days in a Brooklyn brownstone (as did Flynns original structure) Fincher brews an ominous mood of irreconcilable differences. The directors images--beautifully captured by cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth--dont burn; they chill you with corpse-ready cool. Fully recovered from the dutifulness of his The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo Fincher actually flatters and improves on the material with a sneaky theme of performance anxiety Nick a ham pops his engagement ring to Amy in front of a group of bloggers at a launch party for her parents latest book (the ""Amazing Amy"" series thats made her family rich). She in turn begins to have a hard time pretending to be happy. Gone Girl for all its murderous overtones plays like a sad romantic drama--until the thing happens that no fair critic should reveal and it becomes unlike anything youve ever seen a sick dizzying satire of marital mindfulness. The presence of Tyler Perry as a Johnnie Cochran-like mouthpiece is cause enough for laughs but the deeper chuckle of this movie creeps up on you like a dawning realization. ""To have and to hold"" is too easy a way to put it. Go and get clobbered.

Gone Girl is a thrilling roller coaster ride that takes you on a journey from Afflecks infidelity to the faked death of his wife and her month-long life on the run. The movie is a thrill ride with several twists and turns that feel very American Psycho-esque. Rosamund Pike plays her character to perfection.

Its the back of the head of a woman (Rosamund Pike) on a pillow her golden tresses aglow. An unseen man (Ben Affleck) narrates; he suggests that the only way to know whats in a persons mind would be to shatter her skull. Then the woman turns her face to the camera. Its creamy-skinned sleepily beautiful; her eyes open wide and she stares into ours. The look is teasingly ambiguous. Juxtaposed with the narrators violent words the image poses the question Who could want to violate a facade so exquisite? You want to pore over it study it for clues to whats underneath. You get that chance for many of Gone Girls 148 minutes. The movie is phenomenally gripping--although it does leave you queasy uncertain what to take away on the subject of men women marriage and the possibility of intimacy from the example of such prodigiously messed-up people. Though a woman wrote the script the male gaze dominates and this particular male--the director of Se7en and The Social Network--doesnt have much faith in appearances particularly womens. Finchers is a world of masks misrepresentations subtle and vast distortions. Truth is rarely glimpsed. Media lie. Surfaces lie. The maybe-lying protagonist is Nick Dunne an ex-magazine writer whos about to celebrate his fifth anniversary with his wife Amy but who sits that afternoon in the Missouri bar he runs with his twin sister Margo (Carrie Coon) drinking bourbon looking somber and antsy. He arrives at his suburban McMansion to find a glass coffee table smashed signs of a struggle and no Amy. So far so straightforward. But two detectives Boney (Kim Dickens) and Gilpin (Patrick Fugit) linger over the incongruities of the crime scene. Its clear that Nick is being evasive about something. Did he kill Amy? We did hear him say hed like to smash in someones head. Related Stories Tyler Perry on Gone Girls Ending and Singing With Ben Affleck Why You Should Read (or Reread) Gone Girl Before Seeing the Movie Gone Girl weaves the story of Nicks descent into public infamy with excerpts from a diary kept by Amy in a curly cultivated hand. She describes an impossibly sexy New York courtship and a marriage that begins like a romance novel. Still Amy knows how unattainable the ideals of fiction can be. She grew up as the subject of her parents books for children the model for a character called Amazing Amy. How could she measure up to her literary counterpart? While she gave up the cello at age 10 Amazing Amy went on to become a virtuoso The failure haunts her. The rest of Amys tale turns out to be fairly conventional It tracks her enchantment gradual disillusionment and finally fear that her husband will kill her. But somethings off about Amy in the movies flashbacks. Shes telling us the most personal details of her life yet she looks like a sleek aristocratic doll a projection. Theres a suggestion of panic beneath her glassy demeanor but its faint. Shes unnervingly near perfect. Fincher and his cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth shoot their characters from just below eye level. The angles arent extreme--just slanted enough to catch the ceilings to suggest how hemmed in these people are by circumstance and stupid choices and a house (the production design is by Donald Graham Burt the spooky astral music by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross) thats like purgatory in beige. Actors seem constricted anyway in Finchers films. Theyre made to speak their smart-ass dialogue at a brisk clip with no Method dawdling. In this case the effect on Afflecks acting is remarkable. I never thought Id write these words but he carries the movie. Hes terrific. Fincher exploits--and helps him transcend--his most common failing a certain handsome-lug lack of commitment. Affleck shows intelligence and sensitivity in interviews and I sense that as he has gotten older (and become a slick director) he has worked harder to look serious sincere and engaged onscreen. But some part of him holds back and thats the part on which Fincher homes in. Afflecks Nick doesnt mourn convincingly or look remotely honest--even when he tells the truth. In one scene his hotshot lawyer (a genial Tyler Perry) rehearses him for a TV appearance and pelts Nick with candy when he sounds like hes lying. He gets pelted a lot. Its an almost impossible task to get Afflecks Nick to sound like hes speaking from the heart and you can see the frustration in Afflecks eyes at his own inability to get fully into the role. Hes trying to connect his face with his head and falling short. About Pike I must--at the behest of the movies publicists--say less although her acting is also a study in acting. In those few moments when the mask slips shes tight frightened childishly vulnerable desperately grasping for a sense of control that the universe has denied her. I loved looking at her. The other actors--sticking to Finchers metronome--give fast shorthand performances. Coon is likably attuned to Afflecks rhythms Nick and Margos fairly honest rapport (a rarity) can be attributed to their having shared a womb. Dickens is delightfully acidic as the cop and Neil Patrick Harris is pitiful to the point of eeriness as Amys old suitor. Theres also a satisfyingly scathing turn by Missi Pyle as Nancy Grace (going under the name ""Ellen Abbott"") a ghoulish specialist in raising media lynch mobs. I cant leave Gone Girl without going back to its depiction of women though here I risk the dreaded ""spoiler."" (Stop reading if you wish.) The timing for a film that features instances of trumped-up sexual assaults could hardly be worse and while its nowhere near as extreme as Fatal Attraction--which discredited feminist shibboleths by putting them in the mouth of a psychopath--the movie like the novel plays to the stereotype of weak men entrapped by pretend-helpless women. The Spider Woman is of course a noir archetype and Im not prepared to renounce my affection for Double Indemnity and its ilk. But I cant say those movies dont have real-world consequences and coming in the middle of mounting outrage over the pervasiveness of sexual abuse Id hate to see the likes of Rush Limbaugh buoyed by the films bloodcurdling specimen of a predatory slut. For the rest of us its preferable to view Gone Girl as a profoundly cynical portrait of all sides of all relationships First youre blind to the truth of other people then you see and wish you could go back to being blind.

"Gone Girl Review Ben Affleck Rosamund Pike Star in David Finchers Mesmerizing Thriller | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review Gone Girl Justin Chang Chief Film Critic JustinCChang 37 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr September 21 2014 | 0800PM PT Director David Fincher and stars Rosamund Pike and Ben Affleck are at the top of their game in this mesmerizing adaptation of Gillian Flynns novel. A lady vanishes and is soon presumed dead but its her marriage that winds up on the autopsy table in ""Gone Girl"" David Finchers intricate and richly satisfying adaptation of Gillian Flynns 2012 mystery novel. Surgically precise grimly funny and entirely mesmerizing over the course of its swift 149-minute running time this taut yet expansive psychological thriller represents an exceptional pairing of filmmaker and material fully expressing Finchers cynicism about the information age and his abiding fascination with the terror and violence lurking beneath the surfaces of contemporary American life. Graced with a mordant wit as dry and chilled as a good Chablis as well as outstanding performances from Ben Affleck and a revelatory Rosamund Pike Foxs Oct. 3 wide release should push past its preordained Oscar-contender status to galvanize the mainstream. After the perceived commercial disappointment of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" (2011) despite an eventual worldwide haul of more than 230 million Finchers latest R-rated two-and-a-half-hour screen version of a phenomenally successful potboiler will have an easier time translating its considerable pedigree critical plaudits and awards-season hype into must-see status. It helps that the director is working on a significantly lower budget this time around (about 50 million) from a novel that has neither steeped too long in the public consciousness nor spawned any prior movies. It also helps that ""Gone Girl"" unlike ""Dragon Tattoo"" registers as more than just a technically immaculate dramatically superfluous exercise in style. Making an impressive screenwriting debut (with adaptations of her two other novels in the works) Flynn has ruthlessly streamlined but not materially altered her story fully retaining its bifurcated time-shuffling structure and elaborate spoiler-susceptible twists. (To preserve the purity of the experience read no further.) The sheer complexity of the narrative finds an ideal interpreter in Fincher who boasts one of cinemas great forensic minds and who dissects the marriage of Nick and Amy Dunne (Affleck and Pike) with the same clinical precision and eye for minutiae he wielded in his serial-killer procedurals ""Seven"" and ""Zodiac."" Together he and Flynn spin this study of a troubled relationship into an extreme portrait of matrimonial hell as well as a stark metaphor for just how little we may know or trust our so-called better halves. Employing a quick still-shot montage to capture the well-kept lawns and empty storefronts of North Carthage a sleepy Missouri town hit hard by the 2008 financial crisis ""Gone Girl"" opens on the morning of the Dunnes fifth wedding anniversary the same morning Amy inexplicably disappears from their home. Although Nick claims to have no idea whats happened to his wife it takes him little time to rouse the suspicions of Det. Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) whose thorough sweep of the premises and dogged investigation of his personal life yield considerable evidence that the Dunnes marriage like their finances has fallen on tough times. As the case against Nick begins to mount his seemingly insufficient displays of grief make him an easy target for professional witch hunters like Ellen Abbott (Missi Pyle) a Nancy Grace-like cable harridan who leads the charge against him. Its not long before Nick is being coached by not only his tough-but-loyal twin sister Margo (Carrie Coon) but also a high-powered defense attorney Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry). Among other things ""Gone Girl"" functions as a wickedly entertaining satire of our scandal-obsessed trash-TV-addicted media culture; this is a movie as conversant with the tawdry true-crime sagas of Scott Peterson and Casey Anthony as it is with classic thrillers of domestic entrapment like ""Rebecca"" ""Diabolique"" ""Rosemarys Baby"" and ""Fatal Attraction."" Through it all the missing Mrs. Dunne remains a strong insistent screen presence popping up in regular flashbacks to her earlier happier days in New York where this brainy and beautiful young woman led a life of luxury sophistication and modest celebrity. The full arc of her relationship with Nick a working-class Midwesterner comes into focus their blissful first encounter and marriage in Manhattan; the slow draining of their resources exacerbated by their layoffs from their writing jobs; and their eventual relocation to Nicks Missouri hometown where he sinks into laziness and despair leaving Amy trapped in Nowheresville with a man who has lost all motivation to make her happy. Whispers of domestic violence spousal neglect and infidelity emerge and other suspicious figures flit into the frame including Desi Collings (Neil Patrick Harris) a dapper ex-boyfriend of Amys and Noelle Hawthorne (Casey Wilson) her meddlesome neighborhood pal. It soon becomes clear that the central mystery of ""Gone Girl"" will hinge not on what happened to Amy but rather on who she and Nick really are and what brought them to this fateful point in their marriage -- a question that the two leads initially poker-faced performances are in no hurry to answer. Whether its darting between past and present or juxtaposing Amys cryptic diary entries with the handwritten clues she left behind as part of a fifth-anniversary ""treasure hunt"" for Nick Flynns screenplay has an unusual ability to keep the story moving on multiple levels commanding the viewers attention with nary an act of explicit violence for most of the films runtime. And when ""Gone Girl"" springs the first of several game-changing reversals around the halfway point the pleasure stems less from shock value (negligible for those whove read the book) than from the sheer delight the filmmakers seem to take in pulling us deeper into their labyrinth. Fincher is by now well versed in the art of misdirection and his control of this material is assured and absolute. This is hardly the first time hes forced us to question what were seeing and through whose eyes were seeing it (""Fight Club"") or examined the medias tendency to distort and amplify paranoia (""Zodiac"") or juggled parallel time frames and dueling perspectives so as to complicate our sense of the truth (""The Social Network""). But what makes ""Gone Girl"" so particularly potent -- and such an appropriate match for this filmmakers icy view of the human condition -- is its deliciously cynical attitude toward the relationship at its core; its sly awareness of the thin line between love and hate happiness and misery; and its skill at laying bare the cruel manipulative behavioral patterns that spouses can lapse into over time. Likely to elicit uncomfortable chuckles of recognition from women and men alike the film views marriage as a performance of sorts a contract under which husband and wife agree to a certain measure of pretense. The need to perform privately as well as publicly becomes quite literal in Nick and Amys case and ""Gone Girl"" finally pushes this premise into a realm of nightmarish Grand Guignol absurdity. As it reaches a denouement that stays completely faithful to the novels wrap-up (early reports to the contrary) were left to entertain the notion that we may never know the whole truth about the person to whom weve said ""I do"" -- and indeed were probably better off not knowing. Affleck has done some of his finest screen work playing men of power and privilege suddenly brought low by fate (George Reeves in ""Hollywoodland"" a laid-off executive in ""The Company Men"") and hes perfectly cast as Nick Dunne bringing just the right golden-boy-gone-to-seed air to a character who is slowly deprived of his dignity and privacy inch by cruel inch. Often unfairly criticized early in his career for seeming smug vain and inauthentic onscreen Affleck is uniquely suited to the role of a man facing those very charges from a fickle and demanding public; its a tricky turn requiring a measure of careful underplaying and emotional aloofness and he nails it completely. Still as its title suggests ""Gone Girl"" belongs to its leading lady. Pike is the sort of elegantly composed blonde beauty with whom Hitchcock would have had a field day and some may well quibble that the actresss cool British hauteur doesnt fully capture Amys Americas-sweetheart side. Yet as evidenced by her years of solid supporting work she also possesses the sort of ferocious charisma that magnetizes the screen and its a thrill to watch her fully embrace the showiest most substantial role of her career. Hers is the low seductive voice we hear coaxing us through the storys early passages and hers is the character who ultimately exhibits the most dynamic range In any given scene her Amy can seem vulnerable aggrieved calculating heroic overmatched viperous and terrifying. Flynns novel has drawn criticism in some quarters for its alleged misogyny a highly debatable charge that is largely neutralized here by the atmosphere of gender-blind misanthropy that pervades much of the directors work. And in the end Pikes performance is too singular and vivid to be reduced to simplistic terms of degradation or empowerment; suffice to say that Amy Dunne earns her place alongside Mark Zuckerberg and Lisbeth Salander in Finchers gallery of pitiable-yet-monstrous protagonists whose refusal to beg for the audiences sympathy is exactly what makes them such undeniable objects of fascination. The outstanding leads aside nearly every scene of ""Gone Girl"" is dotted with terrific supporting players all of whom fit seamlessly into its broad yet highly specific snapshot of post-recession American life -- a portrait that stretches from a Manhattan literary enclave to a cabin hideaway in the Ozarks. Perry and Harris play expertly against type as the media-savvy lawyer and the creepy ex-boyfriend respectively while Pyle and Sela A. Ward give sharp turns as two rather different TV personalities who play their parts in spinning the Dunne saga for the outside world. David Clennon and especially Lisa Banes are the very picture of WASP entitlement as Amys socialite parents while Dickens and Coon inject a contrasting note of blue-collar dependability as two women who struggle not always easily to give Nick a fair hearing. As ever Finchers behind-the-scenes collaborators turn in work of an exceptionally high standard. His camera unerringly well placed in every scene d.p. Jeff Cronenweth brings a drab underlit look to the Dunnes McMansion the police station and other North Carthage locations (actually Cape Girardeau Mo.) suitably nondescript in Donald Graham Burts production design. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross whose moody electronic compositions have become synonymous with the directors work once again devise a soundscape that all but pulses with dread this time by lacing more traditional orchestral fare with their trademark synths. Working without his usual partner Angus Wall (with whom he won Oscars for ""The Social Network"" and ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"") editor Kirk Baxter cuts the picture to within an inch of its life while still allowing individual scenes and the overall structure to breathe; this is a movie you sink into even when youre on the edge of your seat. Particularly fraught violent moments are heightened by quick fade-ins and fade-outs a hallucinatory effect that registers as palpably as a shudder.

Reply Mary says October 14 2014 at 1004 pm I was disappointed . It started out as a replay of the Laci Peterson case and midway veered off into an unbelievable farce. I just found it too unbelievable and crazy. Reply SGT. StadankO says October 15 2014 at 413 pm Im glad to see not everybody has fallen for this horrible movie. Can not believe everyone has said what a great book and movie this was Reply SGT. StadankO says October 15 2014 at 408 pm You are one hundred percent correct All this book and movie proves is that Americans are super easy to please Terrible story that started good and had great potential but fell apart Reply liz says October 13 2014 at 738 am Movie was ok except the end killed it... I do not recommend it at all..Rent it at home do not spend your money... Reply JFA says October 9 2014 at 1123 pm Scorsese was famous for saying Finchers work left him a bit cold after Fight Club came out. I didnt agree then as I loved FC but his quote could easily apply to this film. Im almost never on the same page as any of the Variety critics as I think all of them do a basic version of temperature taking (gee what will everyone else think?) for example a middling Coen Bros film made all their top 10 lists last year how bold how very bold Its hard to call a film tautly edited that easily couldve lost a good 30 min off its trt. Also very hard to buy into the marriage when the leads seemingly have no chemistry and there was so little development of their relationship. Sort of like the line from Gordon Gekko in Wall Street ""how do a fool and their money come together in the first place."" How did these two even get together. Misanthropic is a nice adjective to use for this film and some of Finchers work but I feel confident this is not one of Finchers better offerings. And folks in this Industry are such saps for twists and turns theyll miss the fact this film will just seem like a lame comment on tabloid culture just a few short years from now when the hype dust settles....

Reply tracy hunt says October 4 2014 at 306 pm I cant believe Variety gave this movie 100 and a string of awesome movies 60s and 70s. The last 20 to 30 mins of this movie were horrible Reply Katie Roy says October 4 2014 at 140 pm Saw the movie last night.

The novel was critically acclaimed. Yes its a mystery (an unconventional one in many respects) but that doesnt mean its a potboiler which has a very different meaning.

Reply Rosamund P. says September 22 2014 at 156 pm Thank God theres one fall movie NOT starring Little Miss Witherspoon Reply JD says September 22 2014 at 638 am How did you all like the book? It was badly written with unsympathetic characters and the last third of the book was the worst. If anyone can make a good movie out of a bad book Fincher can. I have never liked Pike as I always found her cold and unsympathetic which means she should be great in the role. Reply SGT. StadankO says October 15 2014 at 420 pm Funny you said that about Witherspoon because she is one of the producers of the movie ) Reply Harlow Ryan says September 22 2014 at 636 am Sounds like Rosamund Pike was the perfect choice to play Amy.I loved the book and I`m so glad the film doesn`t disappoint. Reply loolooeasy says September 22 2014 at 605 am Was there ever any doubt that this would be less than amazing? I hope Fincher and this production win all of the awards. Hes long overdue as a director. Reply iakashpatil says September 22 2014 at 306 am loved the book. totally looking forward.

Looking forward to seeing Gone Girl. Reply Salma Hayek says September 21 2014 at 1013 pm Ay vote for Penelope... Reply Glenn C. says September 21 2014 at 902 pm To add Fincher is one of the best directors out there Will see anything from this guy. Love the look of his films too. Zodiac was great. Seven The Game etc. Genius. Reply Glenn C. says September 21 2014 at 858 pm Film just proves again that relationships are SO hard. Marriage. Better to be happy and single No fights arguments boredom with each other eventually etc etc etc. The Freedom Reply EJacob Cornelius says January 3 2015 at 918 pm But with a wife like amazing Amy marriage would never be a bore.

With a screenplay by the novelist herself David Finchers film of Gone Girl Gillian Flynns twisty nasty and sensational best-seller is a sharply made perfectly cast and unfailingly absorbing melodrama. But like the directors adaptation of another publishing phenomenon The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo three years ago it leaves you with a quietly lingering feeling of ""Is that all there is?"" With a huge built-in audience of readers this immaculately crafted film will give both book loyalists and general viewers a jolting good time spelling strong box office beginning Oct. 3 after its world premiere at the New York Film Festival on Sept. 26. See more 11 Big Book-to-Big Screen Adaptations In a rare instance of a novelist being permitted to adapt her own book for the screen Flynn has done a fine job of boiling her cleverly structured story down to the essentials doing the necessary trimming but retaining everything her fans will want to see. Despite published reports that major plot changes were being made particularly in the third act this simply isnt true; its an extremely faithful adaptation of what is ultimately a withering critique of the dynamics of marriage. Flynns fans then should be satisfied as this is about as precise an onscreen representation of the work they love as they could wish for. For hardcore Fincher fanatics however it may be a slightly different story. His great talent is as ever plain to see; he gets the most out of every scene situation and character. But in nearly all the films he made through The Social Network you could feel him pushing himself either to the cinematic and psychological brink (Se7en Fight Club Zodiac) or into unfamiliar dramatic terrain (The Curious Case of Benjamin Button The Social Network TVs House of Cards). Dragon Tattoo and now Gone Girl show him working in a somewhat pulpier more popular vein that frankly needs him more than he needs it. The story of a wifes disappearance the resulting media frenzy and growing suspicion over the husbands culpability Gone Girl unfolds in alternating chapters from each partners point of view; Amy Elliott Dunnes diary for a good while serves to fill in the backstory of the relationship while Nick Dunnes commentary begins on the day the lady vanishes and continues as the mystery deepens. Watch more Gone Girls Eerie New Trailer Targets Ben Affleck as Suspect No. 1 A good-looking pair of New York writers Amy (Rosamund Pike) and Nick (Ben Affleck) were uprooted and transplanted quite infelicitously to small-town Missouri thanks to a financial setback and Nicks fathers illness. Glamorous and sexy back East they quickly became grating and loveless as they knocked around a personality-free house in one of the worlds most boring places. At least this is what we learn after Amy has gone missing. Nick returns home the morning of their fifth anniversary to find his wife gone a table overturned in the living room and other signs of a struggle; the police soon find traces of blood. Hearts go out to Nick when joined by Amys parents he asks for the publics help in finding his missing wife. Nick also has the support of his straight-talking sister Margo (Carrie Coon) and the detective on the case Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) whos backed up by cop-of-few-words Jim Gilpin (Patrick Fugit). The New York flashbacks doused in the warm light of romantic allure cast a magical feeling compared to the bland bleached-out tans whites and grays of the Missouri settings in which the images of the actors are often so softly lit that sometimes you can scarcely make out their eyes. But according to her diary Amy increasingly feared for her life as Nicks coldness and resentment turned to outright hostility. Gradually unsavory aspects of Nicks behavior come to light turning the public against him -- a sensationalistic TV host (Missy Pyle) eggs viewers on to think the worst of him on a daily basis -- and when circumstances push the police into believing he may have killed his wife Nick hires big-ticket attorney Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry). See more 11 Big Book-to-Big-Screen Adaptations The first big narrative jolt comes just past the one-hour point and Gone Girl virgins should be protected from learning any more about how things proceed from there. Figuring strongly however are a colorful white trash couple (Lola Kirke and Boyd Holbrook) and a troubling figure from Amys past ex-would-be-boyfriend Desi Collings (Neil Patrick Harris). Affleck who has never been more ideally cast delivers a beautiful balancing act of a performance fostering both sympathy and the suspicion that his true self lies somewhere between shallow jerk and heartless murderer. Pike who has been notable in several roles over the past dozen years (Pride amp; Prejudice Jack Reacher) but has rarely played full-blown leads is powerful and commanding. Making Amy even steelier and more brazen than one might have imagined she evinces no vulnerability but rather a strong sense of self-worth as Amy seems to dare others to size themselves up against her. Physically and emotionally Pike looks to have immersed herself in this profoundly calculating character and the results are impressive. Read more David Fincher Cast Ben Affleck in Gone Girl After Googling His Smile Great pleasures are to be found among the wonderfully chosen supporting players. In the most surprising bit of casting Perry gets another chance (after the frightful Alex Cross) in a film made outside his own self-created universe and elevates it with every scene hes in. Kirke is delightfully low-down as an Ozarks dweller who helps send the story spinning in an unexpected direction while Coon effectively blends concern outrage and unbending sisterly love as Nicks sibling. Perhaps best of all is Dickens who underplays her basically procedural role while lining it with droll humor. By contrast Harris performs his sicko part one-dimensionally in warped Anthony Perkins mode so Desi emerges only as a cliched mamas boy type with no shadings. Along with the parallel structural device and alternating narrative voices what distinguishes the novel Gone Girl from any number of other modern mystery thrillers is its corrosive view of marriage a theme amply underlined by Pikes spiky performance. At the same time the characters here as in the book are controlled as much by plot mechanics as by the natural propulsion of their hearts and minds; the story seems manufactured rather than a genuine expression of the human condition. From Finchers point of view the ultimate bleakness of life as portrayed here is similar to the perspectives of his other dark and murderous films but this one does not stare mercilessly into the existential void in the manner of his best most disturbing work.

At his best Fincher has a sense of humor that not only cuts through the darkness but actually contrasts it to significant effect. After the dour sour sadistic Scandanavian misfire of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" its a pleasure to note that Finchers latest adaptation of Gillian Flynns best-selling novel of the same name is both wicked and wickedly fun. Not only brutal but also brutally funny ""Gone Girl"" mixes top-notch suspenseful storytelling with the kind of razor-edged wit that slashes so quick and clean youre still watching the blade go past before you notice youre bleeding. See video New Gone Girl Trailer Suggests That Ben Affleck Murdered His Wife (Video) Like some mix of ""Scenes from a Marriage"" and ""Ace in The Hole""  as shot by Michael Mann with a Hitchcock Blonde to kill (or die) for in the lead ""Gone Girl"" tells the story of Nick (Ben Affleck) and Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike). The film begins in New Carthage Mo. on their fifth anniversary; Nick runs a few errands and blows off some steam returning home to find an empty house an upended coffee table shattered in the living room and no sign of Amy. When the cops (played by the superb Kim Dickens and a mostly silent but excellent Patrick Fugit) arrive its clear theres been a struggle inside the Dunnes house; as Nick and Amy narrate their marriage to us and the police investigate an ever-increasing number of clues though its clear there were signs of struggle inside the Dunnes marriage as well. Made up of police inquiries and diary entries love stories and other fake-outs ""Gone Girl"" is in no small part a story about storytelling and the difference between perception and reality with comforting tales interrupted by the low ominous thud of the metaphorical other shoe dropping. Amys mom and dad are best-selling authors of childrens books with their series ""Amazing Amy"" an improved version of their daughters life; Nick and Amys American dream marriage with the big house and the big love looks is utterly perfect until you shake it and the rot comes spilling out. Also read Tyler Perrys For Better or Worse Fall Premiere Draws Best Ratings Since OWN Series Debut And when upsetting revelations come out in the case celebrity defense attorney Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry a natural as a hearty likable cynic with great media presence) smoothly states how ""Well have to ... realign the publics perception ..."" Flynns script is loaded with nicely-tuned observations not just about the rules and rituals of the modern American marriage but also about a media that shrieks speculation more than it speaks the truth and worries about slogans more than facts. The authors clever cruel and cool work also gives Pike the role of a lifetime in the shining secretive Amy while still making her human and comprehensible. Affleck whos personally had to endure a level of media scrutiny that makes a colonoscopy look dignified brings much of that history to Nicks affability and desire to please. When he needs to play the part Nick does but hes not as smart as he thinks he is. Both performers are brilliant. Also read Ben Affleck Admits to Being Really Good at Counting Cards in Blackjack With its shifting perspectives and timelines its constant conflict between whats said and whats truly seen ""Gone Girl"" is clean clear and perfectly constructed. Cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth and editor Jeff Baxter both regular Fincher collaborators deliver the kind of work that looks easy but assuredly and on reflection is decidedly not. The score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is a more mixed proposition effective in the places it works and distracting on several occasions where it doesnt. The supporting cast is a thing of wonder -- there are familiar faces like Dickens Fugit and Perry all pushed to greatness with Missi Pyle perfect as the films version of harridan-for-justice Nancy Grace Neil Patrick Harris elegantly worrisome as on old suitor of Amys and Carrie Coon (""The Leftovers"") a revelation as Nicks loving tough sister Margot. Also read 7 Breakout Movie Stars of Fall 2014 - From a Gone Girl to a Maze Runner The best Hitchcock films struck a balance between elegance and violence a peculiar mix of champagne fizz and spilled crimson blood; ""Gone Girl"" with its giddy revelations and grim-grin reversals incorporating ugly facts and uglier fictions fits perfectly into a modernized version of that superb tradition. ""Gone Girl"" portrays marriage not just as warfare by other means but as many different kinds of battle -- class conflict sexual gamesmanship wrangling over money fighting over the future -- with plenty of blood spilled. Thats part of what makes it as damned good as it is; ""Gone Girl"" is that rare entertainment that rewards your intelligence instead of insulting it that rare thriller interested in emotional wounds as much as physical ones. ""Gone Girl"" will earn plenty of loud shouts of applause awed sounds of surprise and shocked laughter but what makes it worthy of them is all the hushed uneasy conversations its guaranteed to inspire in the long unsettled silence to come after.
