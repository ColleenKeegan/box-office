If Adam Sandler characters can do it the upbeat message goes then anyone hormones willing can overcome the funk and fumbles of adolescence. Only in real masterpieces of young angst -- a book like The Catcher in the Rye a movie like Welcome to the Dollhouse -- do vulnerable antiheroes like Holden Caulfield and Dawn Wiener actually spectacularly lose. Anyhow the titular underdog in Amy Heckerlings well-meaning but hopelessly lost little comedy isnt so much a dud as a nice friendly polite college freshman with a bad haircut and a worse hat. Armed with a full scholarship but deficient in protective cynicism Paul Tannek (American Pies Jason Biggs) leaves generic Smalltown USA to attend a nameless school similar to New York University in Manhattans Greenwich Village. His father (Dan Aykroyd one of many Saturday Night Live alumni making cameo appearances) imparts Boys Life advice on how to be a good conversationalist ""Interested is interesting."" Knowledge of a few classic SNL skits might have served the kid better. Paul is gaga about Dora (American Beautys Mena Suvari) a tiny-boned big-eyed sophisticate he meets in a lecture class. Dora is gaga about their professor (Greg Kinnear) an adulterous poser for whom Dora is just a side dish. (Kinnear remains an expert at sliding from charm to smarm.) But the problem is that Loser isnt gaga enough. Biggs the poor girls Freddie Prinze Jr. keeps a tighter rein than necessary on his ability to act the putz (possibly to atone for the tedious geek he recently played opposite Prinze in Boys and Girls) and we miss the goofy awkwardness. Suvari playing a more vulnerable vampette than she did in American Beauty squelches any trait of Doras that might be construed as manipulative and we miss the hint of bitchiness. Oddly the affectionate empathy for teen life that Heckerling plugged into so electrically in Clueless and Fast Times at Ridgemont High feels under-amped here; the charm she knows how to pull from young actors (Alicia Silverstone owes the director big-time) doesnt make up for Losers loss of what Kinnears pompous prof would call raison detre. We learn that date-rape drugs are bad which is worth repeating. And we learn that stoned slobby cheating destructive roommates will eventually receive their rightful penalties which is wishful thinking Just because deserving underdogs may advance doesnt mean the undeserving elite will be properly punished in later life. As for the promise that nice guys finish first Holden Caulfield would no doubt have had a few choice words for Heckerling that its all one big goddamn phony lie.

But this tepid comedy-drama is lamentably aptly titled. Residual buzz from leads Jason Biggs and Mena Suvaris 99 hits (""American Pie"" ""American Beauty"" respectively) reps the flavorless pics sole notable sales point. Having helmed ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" (1982) and ""Clueless"" (1995) among the best youth pics of their respective decades Amy Heckerling tries adding a third charm to that bracelet with ""Loser."" But this tepid comedy-drama is lamentably aptly titled. Residual buzz from leads Jason Biggs and Mena Suvaris 99 hits (""American Pie"" ""American Beauty"" respectively) reps the flavorless pics sole notable sales point. That alone wont likely stir much excitement in a market already saturated with mediocre teen titles; theatrical returns look blah ancillary better. Bland seriocomic tenor of prologue -- as outbound college scholarship student Paul (Biggs) bids farewell to his doting pa (Dan Aykroyd) and relatives in the Midwest -- suggests we and he are being set up for a high-energy rude awakening. But as the story jumps to Gotham Heckerlings screenplay and direction remain stubbornly uninspired. Which is not to say Pauls intro into urban university life goes smoothly. His three roommates (Zak Orth Tom Sadoski Jimmi Simpson) all vaguely defined too-cool-for-school types form a disdainful united front against their studious neat unhip fourth wheel. They engineer his ouster then pretend it was all a joke when stepped-up dormitory strictures make Pauls makeshift new digs (a spare room in an animal shelter) look like the perfect off-site party locale. Meanwhile pretty fellow student Dora (Suvari) faces her own housing crisis Her family cant afford dorm life and cohabitation is nixed by much older b.f. Edward -- aka Prof. Alcott (Greg Kinnear) snobby instructor of an English 101 course that both she and Paul are taking. Shes stuck commuting while holding down a humiliating job at an upscale girlie club downtown. When their repeated path-crossings leave Paul smitten he invites Dora to a concert by Everclear the band she too-aptly describes as purveyors of ""self-loathing complaint rock you can dance to."" (Incessant Everclear plugs climaxing in a routine concert seg are the most blatant of pics many product placements.) She accepts but is waylaid by a party the mean ex-roomies are throwing at Pauls place. They slip her a mickey with presumed rape intent and she winds up in the emergency room. Improbably Paul is soooo nice he fakes get-well notes from the indifferent Alcott to protect Doras feelings. It takes a drearily long uneventful time before the heroine figures out whos Mr. Right and whos Mr. Obviously Wrong. Earnest but shallow pic taps scant comic inspiration while flirting with darker themes it can scarcely support. The drugs-and-rape issue feels bewilderingly out of place here given that Pauls roommates are tepidly sketched as crass pranksters rather than true sociopaths-in-the-making. Likewise exploitative relationship between Alcott and Dora is too unpleasant to be funny yet too one-dimensional to stir any real drama. The slimmed-down post-""Pie"" Biggs is OK as a quirky cute hero. But he gets little comic mileage from Pauls alleged farmboy naivete which is signaled more by his ear-flapped wool cap than any actual behavior. Intended country-meets-city dynamic falls flat on both ends -- Paul is chivalrous but hardly a rube while Dora dresses like a baby vamp but otherwise seems far from worldly. Sporting a very different look from her blond ""Beauty"" Suvari has a bubbly appeal here. But odd-couple chemistry between leads never clicks doused by a scenario that fumbles even its most basic elements. As the supercilious b.f. Kinnear is on the nose -- though given that his character has no redeeming qualities or interesting bad ones perfs too-credible jerkdom doesnt do pic much good. Aykroyd and other even more briefly glimpsed comic talents (David Spade as a vid store clerk Colleen Camp as a homeless woman comedians Bobby Slayton Andy Dick and Scott Thompson) are wasted in undistinguished bits. Budget limits are sometimes obvious -- why are MTV faves Everclear playing to such a small aud? -- while largely Canadian-shot feature doesnt eke much Manhattan atmosphere out of tourist-board gawks at the Museum of Modern Art or a Broadway ""Cabaret"" performance. Tech and design aspects are pro but routine. David Kitays mawkish score fills the gaps between various modern rock cuts (plus incongruously Simon amp; Garfunkels ""Scarborough Fair"") that are all too clearly present only to provide a marketable soundtrack disc. And no Becks 1994 breakthrough hit ""Loser"" is not among them. LoserProductionA Sony Pictures Entertainment release of a Columbia Pictures presentation. Produced by Amy Heckerling Twink Caplan.

Paul (Biggs) moves to NY from Hicksville carrying comforting adages from Pa (Aykroyd). He at once stands out as a socially awkward scholarship student dissed by his camp rich-kid roommates. Meanwhile sparky Dora (Suvari) struggles with college fees and conducts a clandestine affair with tutor Kinnear. These opposites find refuge in one another. The film is less explicitly bawdy than others of its ilk and its sentimentalism is cut with wit. There are references to youth dramas such as My So-Called Life angsty rockers Everclear make a noisy cameo and Paul admits his Sarah McLachlan T-shirt is seriously uncool. American Beauty starlet Suvari even sneaks into Sam Mendes Broadway production of Cabaret. Heckerling has described Losers as the anti-Clueless but its also an entertaining fantasy. And on screen being the outsider is always a plus.

"Loser | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; loser ) Loser (United States 2000) A movie review by James Berardinelli Calling a motion picture Loser is a brave move because it places the film in a precarious position if the critical reaction is less enthusiastic than the producers expect. In this case however thats not an issue; this movie succeeds in a modest-yet-satisfying way. In fact its one of the summer of 2000s few pleasant surprises. The writer/director/co-producer is Amy Heckerling a woman who at age 45 still has her hand on the pulse of men and women less than half her age. With Loser Heckerling has graduated from high school (where two of her previous outings Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Clueless were set) but the qualities that make her characters appealing have not been lost in the process. Loser is a straightforward romantic comedy where the relationship between two unlikely friends develops into something deeper than a casual acquaintanceship. The films romantic complications are restrained - they neither stretch the viewers credulity nor make the characters seem airheaded vindictive or blind. Most importantly the protagonists - a geeks geek named Paul (Jason Biggs) and a gothic grunge girl named Dora (Mena Suvari) - are presented as real people with genuine problems. These two seem less like the product of a writers invention than the type of individuals one meets on a college campus. Of course there are limits to the level of verisimilitude that can be employed since a truly satisfying ending requires a heavy dollop of fantasy. Paul is a hopeless loser but hes also the nicest guy attending a prestigious New York City university. He wont accept money from his grandfather is nice to his little sister and willingly hangs out with his dad (a cameo appearance by Dan Aykroyd). However in a city populated by cynics he is viewed as a living caricature. His three party-animal roommates (played by Thomas Sadoski Zak Orth and Jimmi Simpson) find his presence so restricting that they have him kicked out of the dorm. The school relocates him to a small room in a local veterinary clinic. Meanwhile Dora is trying to balance her financial difficulties with her studies and a torrid affair shes having with her European Lit professor Edward Alcott (Greg Kinnear). She works nights as a waitress at a topless bar but her commute is running her down. One night at a party held by Pauls ex-roommates in the veterinary clinic someone slips something into her juice and she wakes up in Pauls care. As Paul Jason Biggs has slipped into the same kind of role that brought him recognition in American Pie. Based on the evidence one can assume he has been typecast but he understands this part - his on-screen persona is likable and easy to relate to. Biggs effectively conveys the spectrum of emotions Paul endures as his relationship with Dora develops - tenderness hope excitement disappointment jealousy and loss. Its a cycle almost everyone is familiar with and Biggs allows us to re-live it here. Meanwhile Mena Suvari plays a less troubled character than she did in American Beauty but someone without the idealism of American Pies choir girl Heather. Like other Heckerling female leads (Jennifer Jason Leigh in Fast Times and Alicia Silverstone in Clueless) Suvari exhibits star quality. Shes smart and sassy and evolves a palpable chemistry with Biggs. Romantic comedies especially those set in high schools and colleges have suffered from overexposure in the past few years. Most have been clichA(c)-riddled pabulum - endless thinly-veiled reworkings of Pygmalion and The Taming of the Shrew. The danger is that Loser will suffer from guilt by association at the box office. That would be a shame because Heckerlings movie is smarter and breezier than anything that has recently traveled this well-trodden path. While Loser never quite breaks free of the romantic comedy envelope it occasionally tests the boundaries. With one exception the film earns its laughs without turning its characters into buffoons or endangering their dignity. And its a pleasure to watch a movie in which the protagonists speak and act like individuals who have more on their minds than who theyre going to take to the big dance (a plot device that is thankfully absent in Loser). Academic and financial issues rank as highly on Paul and Doras list of priorities as finding the right mate. Loser is guaranteed to appeal to anyone who has liked the umpteen recent late teens/early twenties romantic comedies but the film also has qualities that could attract a wider audience. Despite the presence of American Pie alums Biggs and Suvari this is not an excursion into crude lewd humor and madcap sexcapades. Both the sexual content and the profanity are limited; Heckerling expects the characters to carry Loser which they do. And thats an all-too-rare statement to make about any Hollywood-based production these days. Loser bucks the summer trend proving that a little light romance is an appealing antidote to an overdose of testosterone and adrenaline.

Starring Jason Biggs Mena Suvari Greg Kinnear. Directed by Amy Heckerling. (PG-13. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Filmmaker Amy Heckerling is pretty brave when it comes to naming her movies. With titles like ""Clueless"" and ""Loser"" she sets herself up. But while the former was a winning and pop-culturally relevant look at teen life ""Loser"" is just as it sounds. Heckerling who created the groundbreaking and much-revered ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" once seemed to have a special understanding of young people. None of that insight emerges in ""Loser"" a slackly paced and contrived look at college life. Paul (Jason Biggs ""American Pie"") is a brainiac from the sticks who leaves his loving dad (Dan Aykroyd in a cameo) for the supposed sophistication of a New York university. What he finds there is far more uncouth than anything back in his sleepy hamlet. He is assigned to share dorm space with a supposedly comic trio of drug-taking rich boys none of whom takes too kindly to his studious ways. Heckerlings biggest miscalculation is giving substantial screen time to these cartoonish thugs whose idea of a fun time is dropping date rape drugs in unsuspecting girls drinks. Like the narcotics and alcohol consumed so heartily in the film comedy and potential sexual assault are a nauseating mix. Mena Suvari the teen temptress from ""American Beauty"" plays Dora an elfin goth-flavored girl from the wrong side of the bridge whom Paul meets in class and clumsily sets out to woo. Standing in his way is her professor boyfriend (Greg Kinnear) a manipulative Henry Higgins. As with many professor-student romances he imparts to her important life lessons -- like how she can properly fetch his tea. Kinnear brings just the right mix of sex appeal and menace to the role though the professor would be transparent to anyone but a love-struck 19-year-old student. The pairing of Suvari and Biggs both of whom were in ""American Pie"" but shared few scenes together is another nice bit of casting. They make an adorable couple but it takes far too long for their romance to blossom. Instead we mostly are regaled with the machinations of the scuzzy roommates and the conniving professor. Slimmer than he was in ""American Pie"" and sporting a contagious grin Biggs is winning as the titular ""Loser"" even though much of the characters behavior is implausible. A supposedly smart guy his Paul wears a hunting cap with earflaps in the early fall in New York City which implies that he lacks not only fashion sense but any sense at all. Perhaps his hat choice along with the dweeby haircut and the unholy trio of roommates are supposed to convey the whimsical tone the movie strives for. But the broad caricatures and implausible situations weigh the film down instead of lightening it up. ""Loser"" also is hopelessly lost when it comes to spotlighting its biggest assets Suvari and Biggs. -- Advisory This film contains drug use and explicit language. ..
