"""One for the Money"" starring Katherine Heigl Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review One for the Money starring Katherine HeiglThe star works to bring a gutsy vulnerability to her role as a bounty hunter in the film adapted from a Janet Evanovich novel but the romance and laughs are wanting.January 30 2012|By Sheri Linden Special to the Los Angeles Times Katherine Heigl stars as Stephanie Plum in ""One for the Money."" (Ron Batzdorff / Lionsgate )A mercenary pall hangs over the criminally uninspired ""One for the Money."" Tough economic times force Stephanie Plum the main character to take a potentially lucrative assignment as a bounty hunter. Fair enough. Except that the filmmakers have left the creative spark out of the equation. The Katherine Heigl vehicle is an ungainly mix of flat-footed gumshoeing and strained attempts at hilarity all delivered with an unconvincing Joizy vibe. As in most Hollywood romantic comedies of recent vintage the romance and laughs in ""Money"" are respectively wan and nonexistent. Heigl who also produced plays Trenton divorcee Stephanie an unemployed lingerie saleswoman whos behind in her car payments and rent. Just in the nick of time she becomes a so-called recovery agent for her bail bondsman cousin Vinnie (Patrick Fischler). A 50-grand payout is Stephanies if she can bring in bail jumper Joe Morelli (Jason OMara) a cop accused of killing an unarmed man. He also happens to be the guy who unceremoniously ditched her back in high school. In an attempt at a running joke nearly everyone Stephanie encounters recalls that she responded to the rejection by running him over and breaking his leg. Spunky Everyone also insists that shes still interested in him and the audience must endure the onetime couples transparent sparring as they keep crossing paths. While she tracks her wanted man Stephanie enjoys the bounty-hunter mentorship of Ranger (Daniel Sunjata) who gallantly buys her a gun because well she doesnt have a permit. Heigl who struggles to bring a gutsy vulnerability to the part is most convincing when conveying Stephanies horror and sense of accomplishment after she uses that gun in a life-or-death situation. But by that point in the film after a car bombing has been used as a punch line life and death are meaningless concepts on the road to the inevitable happy ending. Plenty of movies have mined laughs from crime and romantic revenge. But in adapting the first installment of novelist Janet Evanovichs long-running mystery series screenwriters Stacy Sherman Karen Ray and Liz Brixius achieve neither dark humor nor screwball cheer a unless being handcuffed naked to a shower rod counts as either. Whatever Stephanies charms on the page shes not much of a rooting interest in this incarnation. That director Julie Anne Robinson demonstrates no feel for storytelling tension is underscored by the use of voice-over narration with Stephanie explaining whats already obvious or trying in vain to drum up the urgency thats missing from the action. In addition to Fischler (who had a memorable turn as TV star Jimmy Barrett on ""Mad Men"") a number of supporting performers register with colorful turns a Sherri Shepherd as a friendly hooker Adam Paul as a would-be suitor and Fisher Stevens as a rival of sorts. More in keeping with the rote dreariness of the movie is John Leguizamo on autopilot in a key role albeit in a plot that matters less with each proceeding scene. Most depressing is the spectacle of Debbie Reynolds in the de rigueur Betty White role a Hollywood having relegated seniors to the category of adorably ""outrageous"" while it caricatures single women as desperate updates on romance-novel heroines. calendarlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESRaunch rules as R-rated films Ted Magic Mike...July 1 2012Movies Movies Almost EverywhereMarch 13 1997MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesEntertainmentBounty HunterKatherine HeiglCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-one-for-the-money-20120130,0,5772899.story?track=rss",200,oneforthemoney0,oneforthemoney,latimes

Why do best-selling mystery series featuring female detectives have such a hard time on the big screen? Even though Kathleen Turner was still close to the peak of her Kathleen Turner-ness 20 years ago her playing Sara Paretskys Chicago-based heroine in ""V.I. Warshawsky was a dud. Now joining Turner in distaff detective dud-dom is Katherine Heigl playing Janet Evanovichs decidedly non-macho New Jersey-based bounty hunter Stephanie Plum.""One for the Money based on the first novel in the series isnt terrible. Terrible might have been more interesting. Like Heigl the director Julie Anne Robinson is a veteran of ""Greys Anatomy and the movie has the by-the-numbers efficiency of a decent TV series and about as much flavor.Having been laid off six months earlier as the manager of a Macys lingerie department Stephanies so desperate for a job she goes to work for her cousin a bail bondsman. She can earn herself 50000 by bringing in a cop charged with murder (Jason OMara) whos skipped bail. Even better a decade later shes still smarting over his having dumped her after a one-night stand in high school. So Stephanie is definitely on the case. This eventually leads to encounters with a couple of comedy-relief hookers several other murders and a heroin ring.The biggest problem ""One for the Money faces is trying to have it both ways gritty-ethnic inner city vs. girly-girly comic. ""One-hundred twenty-five pounds of angry female can do a lot of damage Stephanie boasts after tackling a bad guy - ""130 tops (which would be a lot funnier if Heigl had any reason to joke about her weight). This is chick-lit Elmore Leonard. And while Heigl doesnt embarrass herself neither she nor Robinson has the kind of knack for the offbeat needed to exploit such eccentric material.The best things in ""One for the Money all have an out-of-left-field quality the rest of the movie lacks. Leonardo Nam as a crime witness hilariously channels his inner Jeff Spicoli ninja division. Debbie Reynolds turns up as Stephanies grandma doing her demented-twinkle bit. She even gets to shoot a .38. Some venturesome theater company could make a big impression by starring her in a drag ""King Lear. Who might have guessed half a century ago that Reynolds would become a consistent source of crazed delight onscreen? Maybe thatll be true for Heigl too in another 50 years. For now though shes a humdrum glum Stephanie Plum.Mark Feeney can be reached at mfeeneyglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2012 Globe Newspaper Company.

At area theaters. There are certain actors who even as we question their judgment laugh all the way to the bank. Nicolas Cage for example or Jennifer Aniston. But Katherine Heigl is another story. Though she can be winning in the right projects she undermines herself so often that shes now treading dangerous ground. Whatever she was paid ""One for the Money"" wasnt worth it. For starters shes disastrously miscast as a character beloved by fans of novelist Janet Evanovich. Brash blue-collar Stephanie Plum lives in Trenton N.J. -- described by Evanovich as ""a good place to buy calzone or play the numbers."" Heigl neither looks nor -- more important -- acts like someone whod ever get her hands dirty in either endeavor. As in the best-selling book Stephanie is forced to become a bounty hunter after she loses her job selling lingerie. Her assignment is to bring in vice cop Joe Morelli (Jason OMara) whos accused of shooting an unarmed man. Shes thrilled with this task Morelli seduced her in high school and then dumped her. Shell chase down any lead and peek in any dark alley until she catches him. But there are other people on his trail too and it seems theyll do whatever it takes to get there first. It wouldnt be fair to blame only the lead for this misfire even if she did also executive-produce. The three writers and director Julie Anne Robinson dont offer a single reason why theyd want to bring this popular series to the screen. Stephanies family (including a fluttery Debbie Reynolds) is absurdly two-dimensional and there isnt a moment of realistic action romance or drama to be found. Only a sly John Leguizamo and Ana Reeder as Stephanies no-nonsense colleague come out unscathed. There have been notable exceptions but Heigl tends to imbue her characters with an off-putting mix of insecurity and abrasiveness. This film is a prime example. She never relaxes as if shes aware that shes miscast. Shes too movie-star glam too stiffly prissy and too lacking in any affection for Stephanie herself. (We wont even get into her attempts at a Jersey accent.) In Evanovichs books Stephanies most endearing traits are her flaws. In the movie she has few assets and her flaws are as charmless as everyone elses. Similarly only those who found Gerard Butlers generic arrogance attractive in ""The Ugly Truth"" (also starring Heigl) will appreciate OMaras blandly obnoxious alpha-hunk. The film does set up sparks with a more interesting character (Daniel Sunjata) but then it goes nowhere. Heigl still seems to believe in the retro-sexist ""chick flick"" model in which any strong heroine must be rendered unthreatening by ditsy ineptitude. (Though its clumsily staged as a creepy power play the filmmakers actually expect us to be charmed when Morelli handcuffs a naked Plum to her own shower.) Fortunately that cliche is fading fast as audiences look for something smarter wittier or simply more entertaining. Theres still plenty of potential in this series as long as a new team comes aboard. Now that Heigls made one for the money its time we had some fun. Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"None for the Money two to go |       NJ.com comments None for the Money two to go Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on January 27 2012 at 705 PM updated January 28 2012 at 1049 AM View/Post Comments Ron BatzdorffKatherine Heigl and Daniel Sunjata star in ""One for the Money."" It is not a great sign when a big studio movie opens without much in the way of publicity and interviews. Its a terrible sign when a big studio movie opens without any advance screenings. And when tickets to a big studio movie are dumped as part of a two-for-one Groupon deal -- well thats one for the books. Also ""One for the Money."" The film is based on the mystery by South River native Janet Evanovich who recently told The Star-Ledger she approved of the adaptation. So thats nice for her I guess. But if this movie is truly faithful to her popular series -- well then I have no idea how it ever became popular because the movie itself is dully unbelievable and generally pretty dreadful. Katherine Heigl stars as Stephanie Plum a scrappy divorcee who lives in Trenton and used to work in the lingerie department at Macys in Newark until she got laid off six months ago. And if youre wondering why anyone in Trenton would not only drive more than 100 miles round-trip to work each day but to a job that didnt exist -- because you know there is no Macys in Newark anymore -- then clearly youre from Jersey. Also youre paying attention. Neither is probably recommended if youre going to enjoy ""One for the Money"" -- which by the way apart from a few establishing shots was mostly made in Pittsburgh and rarely makes much sense. Needing cash Plum soon goes to work as a bounty hunter a job that seems to require her to get flustered and drop her gun a lot. Luckily there are two separate hunky guys she kind of has crushes on both of whom regularly show up just to get her out of scrapes. I guess I cant call the movie sexist as it was largely produced directed and written by women. So Ill settle for calling it dull corny and amateurish instead. The direction -- by a veteran of TV series and a single wan Miley Cyrus movie -- is ugly and cheap with clumsy reaction shots and awful lighting. One for the Money author says Katherine Heigl captures her tough-as-nails Jersey girl The script is a mess with one character existing solely so Plum can call her on the phone and unload exposition. But no performer gets out of this unscathed. A Dublin actor named Jason OMara shows up to play ex-cop Joe Morelli -- and is just as convincing a Joe Morelli as youd expect a Dublin actor named Jason OMara to be. Debbie Reynolds or her figure from the Hollywood Wax Museum plays Plums grandmother. As for Heigl who clearly sees this as an important career move -- she also helped produce -- well shes not nearly as winsome and adorable as she seems to think she is. Actually she hasnt been for awhile and if you dont believe me go rent ""Killers."" Or ""Valentines Day."" Or ""Life as We Know It."" Or better yet dont. Be smart and take my word for it. And if Groupon is smart theyll go back to telling us about that great new sandwich shop that just opened up two towns away and leave stale ham-and-cheese hoagies like this thing behind. Ratings note The film contains strong language and violence. One for the Money (PG-13) Lionsgate (106 min.) Directed by Julie Anne Robinson. With Katherine Heigl. Now playing in New Jersey.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The first novel in Janet Evanovichs bestselling Stephanie Plum series has been in development as a film for nearly 20 years which is apparently how long it took for everything to turn out horribly wrong. The casting of Katherine Heigl one of the least-gritty actresses on the planet as rough-and-tumble Stephanie Plum a laid-off lingerie saleswoman who discovers a surprising aptitude for bounty hunting isnt the biggest problem with One For The Money but its a good place to start. As concessions to her blue-collar character Heigl drops her Gs and throws in the occasional nasal vowel but she never demonstrates the bottomless determination thats meant to offset Stephanies total inexperience nor can she make her ineptitude charming. Heigls comic timing is solid and she knows her limitations well enough but theres a hollowness at the movies center right where Heigls heart should be. Stephanies biggest fish is the high-school lothario who broke her heart (Jason OMara) now a police officer wanted for murdering an informant. (There are so many holes in the plot its almost unfair to single one out but start with the fact that a cop makes bail for first-degree murder.) Tracking him down is the easy part but without a gun handcuffs or much common sense the only means she has to bring him in are her none-too-robust powers of persuasion. The manhunt takes her down the citys mean streets or at least the theme-park version thereof--call it Murderland--where shes menaced by assorted (invariably non-white) scumbags and helped out by a friendly prostitute. In her nonstop voiceover Stephanie observes ""Hookers always know things."" Director Julie Ann Robinson works overtime to keep the mood light; even when a car bomb meant for Stephanie takes out someone else the jokes keep flying. During a dinner with Stephanies colorfully ethnic family including a squandered Debbie Reynolds the reaction shots arrive with bludgeoning regularity and the soundtracks burbling organ serves as an incessant reminder not to take anything seriously. Fortunately theres no danger of that.

Based on Janet Evanovichs 1994 book this punitively dull romantic action comedy tracks Stephanie Plum (Heigl) an out-of-work lingerie saleswoman who becomes a bail-bond agent in Trenton (played by Pittsburgh). She is in pursuit of Joe Morelli (Jason OMara) a cop wanted for murder. Bringing him in will net her both 50000 and revenge for his rude behavior after he deflowered her when she was 17. The tangled plot threads--involving scary dead and sassy black and brown people (plus one Asian stoner)--unfold with the same degree of miserable busy futility as Stephanies frequently cut-to hamster running forever in its wheel. Making even more appearances than the rodent is the Big Gulp; the lady bounty hunter is constantly consuming junk--though at least when Heigl is snacking she isnt talking.

Based on the first novel in Janet Evanovichs bestselling mystery-comedy series featuring spunky bounty hunter Stephanie Plum ""One for the Money"" has been in development for nearly two decades during which Evanovich has published more than a dozen follow-up novels. With that sort of time invested and franchise potential awaiting one would assume that someone with a degree of passion for the material would have eventually found their way to the project. The end result strongly suggests otherwise. Tedious and tonally inept this Katherine Heigl starrer looks to be a nonstarter at the B.O. Unfortunately much of the blame can be laid at the feet of Heigl (who also exec produced). That this mildly outspoken star has developed such a devoted cadre of detractors is a strange phenomenon indeed and one not without strong sexist undercurrents but she does herself no favors by displaying nearly all her actorly shortcomings here. Shrill unfocused and irregularly attempting a deep New Jersey accent that seems destined for lasting infamy she plays heroine Stephanie with an almost standoffish lack of conviction. As the film opens Stephanie has been unemployed for several months after losing her job as a lingerie buyer and her bank account is mired in the single digits. After watching through the window as her car is repossessed she agrees to take a filing position with her bail bondsman cousin only to have his secretary offer her a freelance role collecting bail jumpers instead. Her interest is piqued when she notices that former flame Joe Morelli (Jason OMara) is among the most wanted; he broke her heart in high school and his bounty is huge so she agrees to bring him in. Stephanies obvious unsuitability for this particular job is essentially the basis for the entire film yet within two or three minutes of being offered the gig shes tailing perps and breaking into vacant buildings with no one batting an eye. This type of head-scratching flippancy will emerge again and again throughout. In any case missing details never derail the pics romantic-comedy-esque trajectory Stephanie pursues Joe while firing off forced bouts of flirtation; an ultra-studly fellow bounty-hunter (Daniel Sunjata) teaches her some of the ropes; and her wacky family (including a forcefully schticky Debbie Reynolds) tries to set her up with the neighborhood nebbish. Also shes threatened and stalked by a serial rapist (Gavin-Keith Umeh); her ineptitude as a bounty-hunter causes several innocent people to be killed; and a friendly prostitute (Sherri Shepherd) is brutally beaten. A director with a feel for black comedy might have managed to marry these wildly incompatible tones but in the hands of Julie Anne Robinson the entire enterprise merely leaves a sour aftertaste. As Stephanie continually charges headlong into dangerous situations with unsavory men with nary a thought for her personal safety only to be inevitably bailed out by a passing male savior her behavior begins to seem less quirky than clinically insane. Shes far more Timothy Treadwell than Miss Marple. Tech values are functional and the aesthetic is thoroughly smallscreen. Like the book ""One for the Money"" is prominently set in Trenton N.J. though it was largely lensed in Pittsburgh; this location choice does the film no great detriment it just doesnt really make any sense.

TWITTER Katherine Heigl steps into the shoes of Janet Evanovichas best-selling bounty hunter and the results are hardly page-turning. It took 18 years for a screen version of Janet Evanovichs best-selling comic thrillers about New Jersey bounty hunter Stephanie Plum to hit the screen and it should take little more than a weekend to erase any chance of it becoming a franchise. Starring a painfully awkward Katherine Heigl One for the Money mostly resembles a failed television pilot a feeling which is only reinforced by its late-January release and failure to be screened for critics. Sporting brown hair a drab wardrobe and a wobbly Jersey accent as the unemployed former lingerie saleswoman turned ""recovery agent"" Heigl tries hard throughout. But shes undone by the schizophrenic nature of the material which unsuccessfully wavers from comedy to thriller without scoring on either front. PHOTOS Hollywoods 10 Highest-Paid Actresses Director Julie Anne Robinson working from a screenplay by Stacy Sherman Karen Ray and Liz Brixius seems to be trying for dark humor as evidenced by such episodes as a character being blown to bits by a car bomb essentially becoming a punch line. It also is telling that the only two senior citizens on display are a geriatric exhibitionist and a dotty grandma (Debbie Reynolds in a career nadir) who shoots a gun at a turkey dinner. The cutesy plot revolves around Plums first assignment to capture a possibly corrupt and murderous cop (Jason OMara) who also happened to relieve her of her virginity years earlier. The tiresome cat-and-mouse game between the gruff fugitive and his clearly still-enamored pursuer resembles a gender-switching variation of 2010s The Bounty Hunter and we all know how well that film turned out. Strangely while theres little romantic chemistry between Heigl and OMara theres plenty between her and Daniel Sunjata as a mentoring fellow bounty hunter whom Plum describes as ""Michelangelos David dipped in caramel"" and who rescues her on several occasions. Sunjatas droll underplaying enlivens every scene hes in providing a taste of what the film might have been. Several of the supporting players deliver entertainingly pungent comic turns including Sherri Shepherd as a gregarious hooker Fisher Stevens as an ill-fated rival of Plums and Patrick Fischler as her bail-bondsman cousin. On the other hand John Leguizamo as a sleazy boxing-gym owner deserves far better material. Although the films official running time is listed as 106 minutes it actually seemed closer to 90. Not that anyones going to be complaining.

Other than Bruce Springsteen New Jersey is best known for being home to Tony Soprano Snooki and her boorish buds and all those spectacularly ill-mannered big-haired gals on Bravos ""The Real Housewives of New Jersey."" Katherine Heigl is now adding insult to injury for Jerseyites. In ""One for the Money"" a flaccid comic crime drama which she also produced she plays a Jersey girl with an accent so broad it makes Joe Piscopos old ""Im from Jersey"" routines on ""Saturday Night Live"" sound subtle. Compounding the offense the film wasnt even shot in New Jersey. Thats Pittsburgh and nearby spots in western Pennsylvania masquerading as Trenton New Jerseys capital city in the movie. Heigl plays Stephanie Plum. Plum is the bounty hunter heroine of 18 popular mysteries by bestselling novelist Janet Evanovich. In print Plum is blue collar mouthy brave in spite of herself and funny. In this misfire of a movie at least as awkwardly played by Heigl she mostly is just annoying. At the start of ""Money"" Plum is down on her luck being both newly divorced and unemployed. Desperate for a job she gets hired as a bounty hunter by her sleazy bail bondsman cousin. Her first assignment is to track down Joe Morelli (Jason OMara) a Trenton cop accused of murder who also happens to be an old sort of flame of hers. ""Moneys"" works overtime to make its plot and characters colorful with the end result being that it feels forced. Director Julie Anne Robinson (""The Last Song"") who teamed previously with Heigl on ""Grays Anatomy"" never lets the movie relax into its own rhythms. Heigl sporting tousled brunette locks gives a busy unconvincing performance. The Irish-born OMara (""Terra Nova"") and Daniel Sunjata (""Rescue Me"") -- he plays Ranger an experienced bounty hunter who shows Plum the ropes -- provide male eye candy. OMara an actor of both charm and intensity just seems hopped up and silly here while Sunjata comes off better as the uber-cool Ranger. Old pro Debbie Reynolds pops up in a few scenes as Stephanies eccentric grandmother; she mugs outrageously but at least she nails her laughs. Watching ""Money"" one is sadly reminded of ""V.I. Warshawski"" the abysmal 1991 movie with Kathleen Turner which was based on a bestselling series of mystery novels by author Sara Paretsky about a private investigator in Chicago. In both ""Warshawki"" and ""Money"" a beloved female character one loaded with personality and potential becomes far less appealing on the screen than on the page. Mores the pity.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jan. 27 2012 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 224PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Whats the trouble with Katherine Heigl? Since she co-starred with Seth Rogen in the 2007 hit Knocked Up the beamish former star of televisions Greys Anatomy has worked to establish herself on the big screen. Her choice has been a series of romantic comedies - The Ugly Truth 27 Dresses - or with romantic-comedy elements such as Killers and Life as We Know It. Screen grab from the online trailer for the comedy ""One for the Money"" starring Katherine Heigl Movies One for the Money The official trailer Katherine Heigl AP Movies Video Heigl would love to return to Greys Anatomy video Video Katherine Heigl dishes on nude scenes To some degree shes succeeded. Shes now one of a small pool of lead actresses - Cameron Diaz Jennifer Aniston Jennifer Lopez Kate Hudson Anne Hathaway and Natalie Portman - who regularly land romantic comedy roles vying to succeed Julia Roberts as Americas big-screen sweetheart. The problem is in an already patchy genre she seems particularly susceptible to choosing weak scripts and journeyman directors. Shes not just a star but a producer on One for the Money based on a book by New Jersey author Janet Evanovich that came out way back in 1994 when it was first optioned for a Hollywood movie. The novel was the first of 18 best-selling novels (and several spinoffs) featuring her chipper working-class heroine Stephanie Plum a former lingerie sales manager turned bail-enforcement agent. The film with its Joisey accents and Trenton locale seems primed to cash in on the current vogue of such reality shows as Jersey Shore and The Real Housewives of New Jersey. Heigl looking only moderately deglamorized with dyed-brown hair is reasonably plausible as a young woman whose life has not quite turned out as she expected. Divorced unemployed facing eviction and with her car recently repossessed plucky Stephanie settles for a filing job with her sleazy cousin Vinnie of Vinnies Bail Bonds. Instead she ends up as a bail-enforcement agent. Her first case is to track down the lanky handsome vice cop Joe Morelli (Jason OMara a blue-eyed Irishman in the Aidan Quinn mould) who is wanted for the murder of a drug dealer. Coincidentally hes the guy she lost her virginity to when she was a teenager and later ran over with her car when he failed to call her. After an initial encounter in which she easily corners Joe she gets distracted by his erotic come-on and he escapes. She enlists another agent a protective Hispanic hunk named Ranger (Daniel Sunjata) to help track Joe down again. Again pursuit and capture prove childishly easy since Joe has remained in town trying to clear his name. Back-and-forth cat-and-mouse games are occasionally peppered with contrived sexual naughtiness including a scene when he handcuffs her naked in her shower. Sound fun? Not really. Listlessly directed by Julie Anne Robinson (Miley Cyruss The Last Song) from a script written by a trio of writers (Stacy Sherman Karen Ray and Liz Brixius) One for the Money is tepidly glib throughout. Even violent murders are followed by wisecracks or another prurient opportunity to ogle Heigls behind and cleavage. Intermittently we are introduced to broadly drawn comic characters including The Views Sherri Shepherd as a garrulous prostitute and Debbie Reynolds as Stephanies stereotypically eccentric and inappropriate grandmother. If One for the Money can draw the audience of Heigls fans and Evanovichs readership it could be the beginning of something the movies are missing - a feminine comic franchise. But given the dreary quality of this first effort a sequel seems a long shot.
